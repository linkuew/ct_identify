To imagine such responsible provision for DT future is to place undue faith in a system based on DT making of profit . If PRP wo n’t stop building pipelines in DT face of environmental catastrophe , EX ’s little reason to expect them to worry too much about sensible solutions to technological displacement . EX simply is no post - capitalist capitalism and no social policy innovation WDT is VBG to bring PRP about … I am suggesting IN our movements need to challenge , rather than come to terms with , DT neoliberal order and DT capitalist system WDT has produced PRP . For all its claims to be a sweeping measure , DT notion of progressive BI is a futile attempt to make peace with DT system . In reality , even DT compromise is not available . DT model of BI WDT governments are working on in their social policy laboratories will not ‘ end DT tyranny of DT labour market ’ but render PRP more dreadful . DT agenda of austerity and privatization requires a system of income support WDT renders NNS as powerless and desperate as possible in DT face of exploitation and DT wo n’t VB if PRP is relabelled as “ Basic Income ” . ” When PRP all start to literally starve ( some already have , and JJ more have been for decades ) , perhaps then – PRP will eat DT rich .

Misinformation and fear are some of DT biggest reasons parents are refusing to VB their kids vaccinated . Getty Images Rebekah Ficco was terrified of NNS . She experienced a miscarriage with her first pregnancy , and when she was able to VB pregnant again , she was determined to protect her baby . “ I did n’t VB to do anything to jeopardize this , so I poured into reading , ” Ficco told Healthline . “ And when PRP ’re a JJ parent , PRP come across all this information . And I just started seeing more and more about NNS . ” For Ficco , EX was nothing scarier than DT thought of losing her child . And when she read about accounts on DT NNP Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ) of NNS dying of SIDS shortly after their vaccinations , she panicked . “ I had experienced just a very minor piece of what PRP ’s IN to lose a child … but I knew I never wanted to be in their shoes , ” Ficco VBD . Still , she was n’t completely against NNS until after her daughter was born and PRP went to DT first pediatrician appointment . “ I had n’t completely decided CD way or DT other , ” she explained , stating IN her daughter had n’t received DT hepatitis B NN at birth , but did VB DT vitamin K shot . When she brought her questions and concerns to her daughter ’s pediatrician , though , DT response she received pushed her straight into DT anti-vaccination camp . “ DT nurse and DT doctor were both very pushy and judgmental , and PRP just made me feel IN everything I ’d read must be true . PRP must be getting paid by big pharma . I walked out saying I MD never vaccinate my kids , ” she VBD . Ficco ’s initial hesitation to vaccinate her child is n’t uncommon . In fact , experts say more than 60 percent of JJ parents feel this way . L.J. Tan , chief strategy officer of DT Immunization Action Coalition ( IAC ) , told Healthline , “ When PRP talk to parents about NNS , PRP usually fall into three categories . First PRP have DT folks IN myself — 20 to 30 percent of parents who are vaccinating because PRP believe in DT NN . ” Conversely , he explained EX are then 5 to 10 percent of parents who are so resistant to NNS , nothing anyone says will ever VB their minds . “ But then EX ’s DT big group in DT middle , DT 60 percent who are hesitant but who PRP VBP to try to educate , ” he VBD . Ficco was initially CD of those . And had PRP not been for how DT first doctor ’s appointment went , PRP ’s possible she MD have been convinced to vaccinate her NNS entirely on schedule . How doctors talk to parents about NNS Healthline spoke to 20 parents who fall into DT NN - hesitant 60 percent . PRP asked them to explain their concerns and to bring PRP their questions . DT surprising result was IN no two parents had DT exact same concerns . JJ were worried about unique family histories , or random connections PRP ’d read about online . According to Tan , this is true of NN - hesitant parents in general . While JJ might believe this group has fallen victim to DT debunked research of — avoiding NNS simply out of fear of a now - disproven link to NN — most of DT parents PRP spoke with never mentioned DT as an actual concern . Instead , PRP all had their own worries when PRP came to DT NNS meant to protect their NNS . “ PRP often becomes a person by person and parent by parent conversation , ” Tan explained . “ DT ’s why PRP ’s a hard conversation for doctors . ” But with pediatricians often serving as DT front line in addressing these concerns , finding a way to do so without pushing scared parents away is crucial to ensuring DT factual information gets out RB . DT ’s part of what Tan advocates for through DT IAC . “ What PRP ’re trying to do is give physicians room to answer those questions confidently , and to ease those concerns , giving them DT tools to address specific questions , ” he VBD . Of DT parents WDT spoke with Healthline , JJ VBD PRP became concerned about vaccinations after reading reports on VAERS . Parents read about NNS of adverse reactions and VBD PRP determined for themselves IN DT was proof NNS posed a NN risk . DT problem with this conclusion is IN VAERS is a passive reporting system , according to Tan . “ PRP encourage everyone who thinks PRP MD have had any reaction to a NN at all , whether PRP ’s causal or not , to report PRP to VAERS so IN PRP can then VB any possible links , ” he VBD . But DT means IN JJ of DT reports MD not actually be linked to DT NN . In fact , Tan told CD story of a VAERS report where a young woman had died after receiving DT human papillomavirus ( HPV ) NN . DT problem ? She died in a car accident — information WDT was only found after further investigating DT report . Several parents WDT spoke with Healthline RB brought up concerns about DT Gardasil NN , which has been found to prevent cervical cancer , saying PRP had n’t been around long enough or tested thoroughly enough for them to feel PRP ’s safe . But Dr. Sean O’Leary , spokesperson and chair of DT American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious diseases , explained IN simply is n’t DT case . “ More than 100 million doses have been given in DT last 15 NNS . PRP ’s CD of DT best studied NNS PRP have in terms of safety because PRP has been studied in response to some of DT unfounded concerns , and PRP VBP IN PRP ’s very safe and very effective , ” he VBD . Another concern parents voiced was DT idea of overloading NNS ’s immune systems with too JJ NNS at once . Several had opted for alternative NN schedules in order to avoid this . But as Dr. O’Leary explained , “ DT immune system responds to thousands of things every day , so DT amount of proteins WDT PRP responds to in a NN is a drop in DT bucket . ” Tan agreed , pointing out IN NNS have a bigger immune response to things IN scraping their knee , playing in DT mud , or even eating DT food their parents prepare for them than PRP do to NNS . “ PRP are being exposed to far more antigens in your daily life than PRP are from NNS , ” he explained . “ In DT past , NNS MD have had a lot of antigens — DT smallpox NN is a good example . But our current NNS are very finite and controlled , and as our technology has improved , DT amount of antigens PRP VBP from a NN now is very small . ” This is part of DT reason both experts strongly advocate for vaccinating on schedule . O’Leary explained IN PRP ’s important to VB young NNS their NNS as early as possible , because JJ of these diseases are more severe for younger NNS . “ RB , PRP ’s kind of torture , ” he VBD in reference to extended NN schedules . “ Infants feel pain with three shots or CD in a similar fashion , WDT ’s been studied using biomarkers . When PRP spread them out , PRP ’re subjecting them to multiple different painful episodes instead of just CD . ” DT was DT realization Ficco eventually came to . “ DT truth is IN I was terrified , ” she VBD . “ DT misinformation out RB struck me right in my terrified JJ - mama heart . ” PRP was n’t until her sister - in - law started an anti-vaccine blog WDT Ficco began to reconsider her own position on NNS . “ Parents were taking her advice and opinion as fact and WDT really slapped me in DT face . I realized I had been reading and making choices for my kids based basically on her blog , just from different NNS with different platforms , ” Ficco VBD . Once DT realization hit , around DT NN her oldest daughter was nearly 3 and her youngest was 6 months , she took them to DT pediatrician to begin getting their vaccinations . “ My girls have recently been completely caught up , ” she VBD proudly . Today , Ficco VBD her biggest regret is IN she allowed her earlier choices about vaccinations to be guided by fear instead of NN . “ DT biggest thing I ’ve learned in this journey is IN correlation does not equal causation , and to really consider DT source of what PRP ’re reading before PRP take anything as fact , ” she VBD ."

Now , a group of researchers has figured out DT molecular structure of a key protein WDT DT uses to invade human cells , potentially opening DT door to DT development of a NN , according to JJ findings . Previous research revealed IN coronaviruses invade cells through so - called "" spike "" proteins , but those proteins take on different shapes in different coronaviruses . Figuring out DT shape of DT spike protein in SARS - Cov - 2 is DT key to figuring out how to target DT NN , VBD Jason McLellan , senior author of DT NN and an associate professor of molecular biosciences at DT University of Texas at Austin . Though DT NN uses JJ different proteins to replicate and invade cells , DT spike protein is DT major surface protein WDT PRP uses to bind to a receptor — another protein WDT acts IN a doorway into a human cell . After DT spike protein binds to DT human cell receptor , DT viral membrane fuses with DT human cell membrane , allowing DT genome of DT NN to enter human cells and begin infection . So "" if PRP can prevent attachment and fusion , PRP will prevent entry , "" McLellan told Live NNP . But to target this protein , PRP need to VB what PRP looks IN . Related : VBG viral : 6 JJ findings about viruses Earlier this month , researchers of SARS - Cov - 2 . Using DT genome , McLellan and his team , in collaboration with DT National Institutes of NNP ( NIH ) , identified DT specific genes WDT code for DT spike protein . PRP then sent DT gene information to a company WDT created DT genes and sent them back . DT group then injected those genes into mammalian cells in a lab dish and those cells produced DT spike proteins . Next , using a very detailed microscopy technique called cryogenic electron microscopy , DT group created a 3D "" map , "" or "" blueprint , "" of DT spike proteins . DT blueprint revealed DT structure of DT molecule , mapping DT location of each of its atoms in space . "" PRP 's impressive IN these researchers were able to VB DT structure so quickly , "" VBD Aubree Gordon , an associate professor of epidemiology at DT University of Michigan who was not a part of DT NN . "" PRP 's a very important step forward and MD help in DT development of a NN against SARS - COV - 2 . "" Stephen Morse , a professor at Columbia University 's Mailman School of NNP NNP who was RB not a part of DT NN agrees . DT spike protein "" MD be DT likely choice for rapid development of NN antigens "" and treatments , he told Live NNP in an email . Knowing DT structure MD be "" very helpful in developing NNS and antibodies with good activity , "" as MD producing higher quantities of these proteins , he added . DT team is sending these atomic "" coordinates "" to dozens of research groups around DT NN who are working to develop NNS and drugs to target SARS - CoV - 2 . Meanwhile , McLellan and his team hope to use DT map of DT spike protein as DT basis for a . When foreign invaders , such as or , invade DT body , immune cells fight back by producing proteins called antibodies . These antibodies bind to specific structures on DT foreign invader , called DT antigen . But producing antibodies can take NN . NNS are dead or weakened antigens WDT train DT immune system to create these antibodies before DT body is exposed to DT NN . In theory , DT spike protein itself "" MD be either DT NN or variants of a NN , "" McLellan VBD . When PRP inject this spike - protein - based NN , "" humans MD make antibodies against DT spike , and then if PRP were ever exposed to DT live NN , "" DT body MD be prepared , he added . Based on previous research PRP did on other coronaviruses , DT researchers introduced mutations , or changes to create a more stable molecule . Indeed , "" DT molecule looks really good ; PRP 's really well behaved ; DT structure kind of demonstrates IN DT molecule is stable in DT correct confirmation WDT PRP were hoping for , "" McLellan VBD . "" So now PRP and others will use DT molecule WDT PRP created as a basis for NN antigen . "" Their colleagues at DT NIH will now inject these spike proteins into animals to see how well DT proteins trigger antibody production . Still , McLellan thinks a NN is likely about 18 to 24 months away . DT 's "" still quite fast compared to normal NN development , which might take UH 10 NNS , "" he VBD . DT findings were published today ( Feb. CD ) in DT journal ."

[ Note : Some words and / or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words / phrases having no exact counterpart . ] According to this report , with NNP NNP having been surrounded and protected by CD of DT largest private mercenary forces ever seen in DT NNP , DT CIA - led “ Deep NN ” coup seeking his death , or destruction , to keep him from power has failed , thus preparing Trumpian forces , aligned with Obama regime deep cover intelligence operatives , to fulfill NNP John F. Kennedy ’s vow to break this corrupt and demonic NNP spy agency “ into a thousand pieces ” and “ scatter PRP to wind ” — and IN NNP Kennedy was publically executed for attempting , and when NNP Richard Nixon attempted this too , he was ousted in coup . Security Council analysts writing in this report VBP IN DT Bush - NNP Crime Families have been able to maintain their stranglehold over America for nearly 50 NNS due to DT trillions - of - dollars PRP ’ve earned thorough DT CIA ’s international drug cartel — but when these CIA - led Bush - NNP forces attacked DT NNP NNPS on 11 September 2001 in order to be able to invade Afghanistan , who had completely eradicated their opium production , DT Freemason forces led by NNP - Obama had no choice but to respond . With DT first American narcotics experts having gone into Afghanistan in early 2001 , this report notes , PRP concluded IN DT Taliban movement 's ban on opium - poppy cultivation had wiped out DT NN 's largest crop in less than a NN — but with DT CIA ’s 9/11 false flag operation being a success , by 2014 opium production in this nation had soared to JJ record highs insuring IN these monsters illegal drug operation MD continue to operate . Seeking to insure IN their illegal opium and heroin sales MD , RB , continue without interference , this report grimly details , DT Bush - NNP Crime Families , in 2003 , then illegally invaded Iraq in order to open JJ smuggling routes to both Europe and North America — but when Iraqi forces began to crack down on this CIA - led operation , these monsters then turned to Islamic radicals ( ISIS ) to keep their massive drug operation running . Equally as worse , this report notes , since 2000 , DT Bush - NNP - CIA drug empire expanded into Mexico causing a war WDT has , so far , killed nearly 250,000 ( NNP and Mexico deaths ) after their creating what is known as DT Sinaloa Cartel , described as “ DT most powerful drug trafficking organization in DT NN ” , and whose alliance with CIA - led DEA factions turned their main NNP NNPS drug distribution center , located in Chicago , into DT most deadly city America has ever known . As to how DT Bush - NNP - CIA drug empire has been able to operate so freely these JJ decades , this report explains , is due to DT CIA ’s outright purchase of Hillary NNP ’s Democratic Party through illegal drug profits funneled through DT “ too JJ to count ” shell corporations set up by DT American - Hungarian billionaire George Soros , and as DT Panama Papers detail fully . Not just DT Democratic Party , either , did DT Bush - NNP - CIA purchase so PRP MD continue their JJ crimes , this report continues , but DT entire Western NN establishment too — and as revealed by top German reporter Udo Ulfkotte , who this past NN exposed DT CIA ’s total control over all of these mainstream NN organizations , but who was , sadly , assassinated this past week prior to him meeting with NNP NNP . Not being assassinated though , this report notes , is DT Bush - NNP - CIA Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaquín Guzmán ( El Chapo ) — who just hours ago was brought to NNP York City by Trumpian forces and their Obama regime allies — and is able to identify DT “ money routes ” of supply from DT CIA to DT Democratic Party . To DT “ main / central ” CIA “ money route ” of illegal drug profits used to buy DT NNP mainstream NN and Democratic Party uncovered by NNP - Obama forces , this report explains , was through DT owner of a small Washington D.C. pizza restaurant named James Alefantis ( who was “ bizarrely / strangely ” named as CD of DT 50 most powerful NNS in Washington ) and his homosexual lover David Brock — who is CD of DT NNP Crime families most feared operatives . Once receiving Bush - NNP - CIA illegal drug profits , this report continues , David Brock dispersed these monies through a secret network overseen by Hillary NNP campaign chairman John Podesta and his brother Tony Podesta — who , in turn , RB funneled money into DT Republican Party through John Podesta ’s close personal friend , and convicted “ boy lover ” pedophile Dennis Haster , who was once DT leader of DT NNP House of Representatives . Most astounding to note in this report about DT Brock - Alefantis - Podesta - Haster “ money manipulators ” for DT CIA , who have corrupted DT NNP mainstream NN and DT Democratic Party too , is IN NNP Obama ’s closest personal aide , Ben Rhodes , this past week authorized his CBS NNP NN brother , David Rhodes , to release a shocking television report about these monsters — and WDT aired first on DT CBS networks flagship station in Atlanta . As this Security Council report has JJ conclusions WDT are in excess of over 1,700 pages ( DT majority of which remain highly classified ) , DT fastest summery of PRP PRP can relate to PRP is IN : 1. ) Immediately after DT 11 September 2001 false flag attack on American led by DT Bush - NNP Crime Families and their CIA - led “ Deep NNP ” allies , JJ Freemasonic forces led by NNP York City billionaire Donald NNP used as a first “ blocking maneuver ” DT elevation of a relatively unknown minor political figure named Barack Obama to become NN and keep Hillary NNP from power . 2. ) Knowing IN leftist Americans MD gravitate towards DT charismatic Obama , once taking power his “ mission / objective ” was to begin DT destruction of DT Democratic Party — which he succeeded at beyond all expectations . 3. ) RB among Obama ’s “ main / central ” objectives while in power was keeping DT from starting NNP War III , while at DT same NN insuring IN DT Democratic Party MD not be able to disarm DT American NNS . 4. ) Once Obama ’s term was finished , and in a further bid to keep DT Bush - NNP Crime Families from taking power , NNP MD then ascend to power while , RB , destroying DT Republican Party — and who was secretly aided by Obama ’s top political operatives . But to this reports gravest conclusion is IN even though DT Freemasonic forces led by NNP - Obama have so far accomplished all of their goals , DT outcome of this war still remains undecided — but to anyone still puzzled as to why Obama received a Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 for having done nothing , PRP had nothing to do with what he had done , but what his and now NNP NNP were planning to do , stop these monsters once and for all .

Donald NNP , who has long espoused a debunked link between NNS and NN , was set to enter DT White House . He met with environmental activist Robert Kennedy Jr. , who has for NNS argued IN NNS can cause a range of developmental and other NN conditions . Kennedy emerged to report he ’d been asked to chair a commission into NN safety . But seven months later , no such commission has been appointed and DT crisis - mired White House has declined to say whether DT plan has been shelved . STAT contacted Kennedy to see where plans stood . He MD only speak on condition IN STAT publish DT interview in a Q&A format . He argued IN his assertions — which are disputed as a misreading of DT scientific literature by JJ mainstream NNS — have been misquoted and misrepresented in DT NN . Here is STAT ’s conversation with Kennedy . PRP has been lightly edited , for length and readability . DT question I VBP to ask PRP relates to DT NN safety commission WDT PRP had announced in January IN PRP were VBG to head , after PRP met with then NNP - elect NNP . PRP ’s been a number of months now , and EX has n’t been any further JJ announcement . And so PRP ’ve been wondering : Where does this stand ? I ’ve had no discussions specifically about DT NN safety commission , probably since February . I ’ve spoken to DT White House about other issues of NN safety and had a number of follow - up meetings . Can I ask PRP who PRP met with ? Well , I ’ve met with high - level officials in DT White House . PRP ’ve arranged meetings for me with HHS and White House officials and agency officials . Various agency officials , including [ NIH Director ] Francis Collins and his deputy , Lawrence Tabak , I VBP . And I met with Tony Fauci , who ’s at DT National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . Linda Birnbaum , who ’s at DT National Institute of Environmental NNP Sciences . Diana Bianchi , at DT Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child NNP and Human Development at NIH . And over at FDA I ’ve met with Peter Marks , DT director of [ DT Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research ] and some other officials RB . I ca n’t remember everybody at this point , all of DT NNS WDT PRP ’ve met with . And this is since DT NN of DT administration ? Yeah . DT White House officials and DT HHS officials accompanied me . I did PRP at their request . At “ their ” request ? Who is PRP ? So PRP VBD PRP ’ve had no discussions since February about DT NN safety commission ? Not specifically about DT commission . OK . Do PRP VB DT idea is dead ? Or do PRP VB PRP ’s in abeyance ? PRP ’d have to ask DT White House . PRP MD be IN PRP ’s evolved . I ’ve been told IN DT NN is still interested in this issue and IN he wants me to have further meetings with DT regulatory agencies and with DT White House . IN I VBD , I have not talked to anybody in DT White House about DT commission . Do PRP VB EX ’s a possibility DT commission is VBG ahead but not with PRP on PRP ? Again , PRP ’d have to ask DT White House . Do PRP VB to talk about NN safety NN at all ? I have n’t finished asking questions about this . Are PRP disappointed IN so far EX has n’t been a commission set up to do what PRP VBD PRP were VBG to be doing in January ? DT commission was not my idea . I was asked to chair a commission and I agreed IN if DT commission were created IN I MD do DT , I MD sit on PRP . [ But ] DT ’s up to DT White House how PRP VBP to handle this issue . PRP was n’t my idea . I am happy with any steps WDT are taken to make NNS safer and to improve DT scientific integrity around DT process . To reform DT process so IN NNS are subject to DT same kind of safety scrutiny and safety testing WDT other drugs are subject to . PRP need to , prior to licensing NNS , PRP need to do gold standard safety testing , IN every other drug approval requires . PRP need to do double - blind placebo testing . Because particularly when PRP comes to injecting aluminum or mercury into babies , DT consequences MD be latent . In other words , PRP MD not manifest or diagnosed to age 3 or 4 . So DT current protocols , which require testing for NNS of sometimes as little as 48 hours , are not VBG to disclose DT kind of dangers WDT DT NN and DT regulators ought to VB about . DT hepatitis B NNS WDT are currently approved had fewer than five days of safety testing . DT means IN if DT child has a seizure on DT sixth day , PRP ’s never seen . If DT child dies , PRP ’s never seen . If DT child gets food allergies or ADD or ADHD , which do n’t manifest for four or five NNS or are n’t diagnosed or NN , which usually is n’t diagnosed until age 4 , DT regulators will never see DT prior to licensing DT NN . If something happened four or five NNS out from an event , how do PRP VB which event to attribute PRP to ? Well , DT answer to DT question , of course , is double - blind placebo testing . PRP have a control group and PRP have a NN group . Sir , DT ’s done all DT NN . DT is done all DT NN . NNS are tested DT way all DT NN . PRP ’re wrong about DT . PRP is not required for NNS . So most of DT NNS — and I VBP this is surprising to PRP , and PRP ’s shocking to most NNS , because journalists VBP yourself assume IN NNS are encountering DT same kind of rigorous safety testing as other drugs , including multiyear double - blind placebo testing . But DT fact is IN NNS do n’t . And DT reason for DT is PRP ’re classified as biologics . I ’ve read a lot of NN studies . And PRP are double - blind placebo tested . No , PRP ’re wrong about DT . … But in any case , none of them have more than a few months of double - blind placebo testing , which will not allow PRP to spot illnesses IN NN WDT are n’t diagnosed before five NNS . Second of all , in most NNS , for example DT Gardasil NN , PRP do n’t use true placebos . MD PRP move actually back to DT questions WDT I wanted to ask ? [ Inaudible ] aluminum adjuvant WDT ’s highly neurotoxic . So how can PRP VB whether , if PRP do n’t use a true placebo , how can PRP determine whether DT NN is safe . So I had some questions I wanted to ask PRP , and in a Q& A WDT ’s DT way PRP works . I ask some questions , PRP answer DT questions or do n’t answer if PRP VBP . I was wondering , in DT NN since PRP spoke to DT NN in January and he asked PRP to chair DT NN safety commission , DT senior HHS positions have been filled . All of them are on DT record as supporting NNS . I was wondering if DT ’s disappointing to PRP . Well , I VBP regulators WDT are willing to look at DT NN . And who are conversant with DT safety NN , who are conversant with DT vast scientific literature WDT is now published , available on PubMed , which indicates IN JJ — particularly mercury and aluminum in NNS — need to be reassessed . And as I VBD , I ’ve been having meetings with DT regulators to urge them to do DT kind of testing . I did VB to ask PRP as well if PRP had any qualms doing this work for NNP NNP . His administration is taking some steps at DT EPA IN NNS who are concerned about DT environment find very unsettling . Given DT , I was wondering if PRP had any qualms about working with him , because PRP ’re so renowned as an environmentalist . I do n’t VB NNP NNP ’s environmental policies , and I MD not endorse them . I MD say IN NNP NNP ’s administration is essentially destroying 30 NNS of my work on environmental issues , and DT work of JJ other NNS . And I ’ve written extensively about DT . And I VBP NNS understand IN my position is clear and IN my work on NN safety and JJ NN and child safety is not an endorsement of NNP NNP ’s environmental policies . Have PRP made your position known to him ? Have PRP had DT chance to express those views to him ? Well , in my initial meeting with him , PRP had DT discussion . And he knows my position . And he ’s known my position for JJ NNS . … I do n’t VB EX ’s any question with him or with any member of DT administration WDT I ’m opposed to [ EPA Administrator ] Scott Pruitt and I ’m opposed to walking away from [ DT ] Paris [ Agreement ] . … If NNP NNP asked me to serve on a commission on fracking or on pipelines or on JJ NN , I MD do PRP . Can I just ask — and I VBP this will be my last question — PRP ’ve mentioned mercury a lot of times . Thimerosal [ a mercury - based preservative ] is not in most NNS given to NNS at this point . And in fact has not been in childhood NNS in DT NNP NNPS since 2001 , I believe . PRP VBP , studies have RB shown IN since PRP ’s been taken out , NN rates have increased , which MD suggest IN EX is n’t a correlation , and DT ’s what most NNS say . But why do PRP keep talking about mercury when NNS are n’t getting exposed to PRP in childhood NNS ? DT is an industry talking point . DT just simply is n’t true . Mercury was taken out of three pediatric NNS , DTaP , Hib , and hepatitis B in 2003 . But DT same NN PRP was , CDC recommended NN shots for pregnant women and for NNS 6 months of age and during every NN of life . And for most of DT past 15 NNS , virtually all of those NN shots [ inaudible ] . … Since 2004 , so DT MD be , I guess , 13 NNS , most NN shots were loaded with mega doses of mercury . Thimerosal is only in [ NN NN packaged in ] multidose vials . PRP ’s not in NN WDT ’s packaged in a syringe already and PRP was never in FluMist , DT live attenuated NN . Well , here are DT numbers . And DT numbers VBP every NN . I VBP in 2012 , EX were 185 million doses of NN doses manufactured in this country . And I VBP fewer than 10 million were thimerosal - free . Over 90 percent had huge , huge doses of mercury . Not trace amounts as DT industry likes to claim . Trace amounts means less than 1 microgram . PRP contain 25 micrograms , which is 25 times trace amount and over 100 times what EPA ’s safe exposure levels are . … So today , in DT last three or four NNS , DT number has been reduced to 48 million . Which number has been reduced to 48 million ? I believe this NN EX were 150 , around 150 million NN doses manufactured and 48 million of those , or a third , were loaded with mercury . And when PRP say this NN are PRP talking about 2016 - 17 ? Or are PRP talking about DT coming … 2016 . DT ’s a national NN crisis right RB . Mercury is 100 times more toxic , neurotoxic , than lead . Why MD PRP inject DT into a little baby or pregnant women ? PRP ’s insane . EX ’s been an Institute of Medicine report … No , no . No , IOM ’s 2004 report did not exonerate mercury . DT only thing WDT IOM did is PRP looked at a series of epidemiological studies WDT had been recently created by CDC and based upon , and PRP only dealt with CD issue , which was NN . So all of DT other injuries WDT are known to be caused by thimerosal , including ADD , ADHD , SIDS , speech delays , language delay … none of these have ever been studied ."

NN is a spectrum disorder , meaning DT symptoms can be classified in terms of their position on a scale . NNP Speaks points out EX is not just CD type of NN but JJ subtypes influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors . Each individual has a distinct set of strengths and challenges affecting how PRP learn , VBP and problem - solve . In some NNS , NNS with NN spectrum disorder ( ASD ) require significant support , while others can live independently and hold high - functioning positions . Several factors are thought to influence DT development of DT condition . PRP ’s widely known IN autistic NNS often suffer from gastrointestinal ( GI ) problems , with those experiencing DT worst GI problems often having DT most severe NNS of NN . Recent research again highlights DT intriguing link between DT gut and DT brain , and how dysfunction in DT gut - brain axis influences ASD traits . In most NNS , symptoms of ASD appear by age 2 or 3 , although symptoms of associated developmental delays MD appear even earlier . In DT late 1970s , researchers discovered pairs of identical twins often shared ASD , demonstrating DT condition has a genetic component . However , genetics are by far not DT only , or even primary , risk factor . Research from Stanford University School of Medicine , published in 2011 , which again looked at twins , discovered fraternal ( dizygotic ) twins were more likely to share an NN diagnosis than identical ( monozygotic ) twins . Fraternal twins share only half their DNA , while identical twins share 99.99 % , which means something other than genetics is responsible for DT higher rate of double diagnoses among fraternal twins . According to DT researchers , environmental factors are DT most likely culprit . In conclusion , PRP stated IN “ Susceptibility to ASD has moderate genetic heritability and a substantial shared twin environmental component . ” This is not an entirely surprising finding . EX is no such thing as a genetic epidemic ; hence genetics simply cannot be used as an explanation for DT exponential growth in NN NNS . Indeed , research published in 2008 found de novo mutations ( JJ mutations WDT spontaneously arise ) associated with NN were present in just 1 % of NNS diagnosed with NN . Instead , DT majority of NN NNS appear to result from DT activation or expression of a number of different genes , and EX are several epigenetic and environmental factors WDT can trigger them . Among them : • Toxic exposures , such as DT heavy metals aluminum and mercury from contaminated NN food and NNS , toxic microbes such as viruses and mold , glyphosate and electromagnetic fields from cellphones and Wi-Fi , just to name a few . • Brain inflammation triggered by encephalitis following NN , defective placenta , immature blood - brain barrier , immune response to DT mother to infection while pregnant , premature birth and toxins in DT environment . • Gut inflammation triggered by an imbalanced microbiome . Contributing factors include C-section , abnormal microbiome in DT mother , bottle - feeding with infant formula and a processed food diet . Russian neurologist Dr. Natasha Campbell - McBride believes brain toxicity stemming from gut toxicity , otherwise known as Gut and Psychology Syndrome ( GAPS ) , is a key factor WDT sets DT stage for NN , especially when NNS are added into DT mix . According to Campbell - McBride , toxicity flowing from DT child ’s gut clogs DT brain with toxicity , preventing PRP from performing its normal function and process sensory information . As mentioned , recent research confirms and further strengthens DT theory IN DT gut plays an important role in DT development of ASD . According to this NN , published in DT journal NNP Research : In other words , genetic mutations found in both DT gut and DT brain MD be a primary culprit . Mutation in DT neuroligin‐3 R451C has previously been shown to alter synaptic function in DT hippocampus and cortex , resulting in impaired social behavior . Other research has shown neuroligin - 3 mutations can RB trigger “ specialized cognitive abilities ” seen in some autistic NNS . Previous research has RB linked DT mutation to gut dysfunction . Lead investigator Elisa Hill - Yardin , associate professor at RMIT University in Melbourne , Australia , told Neuroscience NNP : DT featured NN builds on earlier research , including unpublished clinical work by Swedish , Danish and French researchers . Neuroscience NNP reports : Even without a genetic component , DT gut microbiome appears to play an important role in ASD . In a 2013 PLOS CD NN , researchers analyzed DT microbial content of fecal samples from 20 healthy and 20 autistic NNS , finding distinct differences between DT two groups . As reported by NNP NNP Today : DT researchers noted DT autistic NNS ’s gut microflora had reduced richness and diversity , which are essential factors in creating a bacterial community capable of dealing with environmental assaults . In other words , having an imbalanced gut microbiome MD render these NNS more susceptible to DT adverse effects of environmental toxins . CD of DT lead authors told NNP NNP , “ PRP believe IN a diverse gut is a healthy gut , ” and suggested IN antibiotics , which MD eliminate beneficial bacteria and have been found to be administered more often in DT first three NNS of life among autistic NNS compared to nonautistic NNS , MD play a key role . DT GAPS protocol MD be DT answer for JJ Campbell - McBride ’s research shows EX ’s a profound dynamic interaction between your gut , brain and immune system . She has developed what might be CD of DT most profoundly important treatment strategies for preventing NN . In her research , Campbell - McBride discovered IN nearly all of DT mothers of autistic NNS have abnormal gut flora , which is significant because newborns inherit their gut flora from their mothers at DT NN of birth . Establishing normal gut flora in DT first 20 days or so of life plays a crucial role in DT maturation of your baby ’s immune system . Babies who develop abnormal gut flora are left with compromised immune systems , putting them at higher risk for suffering NN reactions . If your baby has suboptimal gut flora , NNS can become DT proverbial “ last straw ” — DT trigger WDT “ primes ” his / her immune system to develop chronic NN problems . DT good NN is PRP can rather inexpensively identify GAPS within DT first weeks of your baby ’s life , which can help PRP make better - informed decisions about vaccinations , and about how to proceed to set your child on DT path to NN . DT entire process for identifying NNS who MD be at risk for developing NN from a NN is described in her book “ Gut and Psychology Syndrome , ” but to sum PRP up , in her practice she starts out by collecting a complete NN history of DT parents , and their gut NN is assessed . Then , within DT first few days of life , DT stool of DT child is analyzed to determine DT NN of DT baby ’s gut flora , followed by a urine test to check for metabolites . Together , this can give PRP a picture of DT NN of your child ’s immune system . These tests are available in most laboratories around DT NN . If DT test results are normal , DT risk of NN after NN is significantly reduced . If PRP find IN your baby has abnormal microflora , or begins to develop symptoms of NN , DT GAPS program should be started immediately , as DT younger DT child is when PRP start DT treatment , DT better DT results . DT child RB should not be given any NNS until their gut microbiome tests normal . Identifying abnormal gut flora early on is crucial to protecting your child ’s NN Campbell - McBride reversed her own son ’s NN using dietary changes and detoxification , and her hypothesis is in my view CD of DT most relevant . I believe her GAPS nutritional protocol is important for most NNS these days , as a majority have poor gut NN due to poor diet and toxic exposures , but PRP ’s particularly crucial for pregnant women and young NNS . DT best way to prevent GAPS in DT first place is for DT mother to avoid all processed foods , sugar , antibiotics and birth control pills before conception as these cause yeast and fungi to grow and RB cause leaky gut . This can then be followed by breastfeeding and avoiding DT use of antibiotics during ( intrapartum ) and after delivery . Another important factor is vitamin D deficiency — especially in conjunction with damaged gut microbiome . Optimizing your vitamin D levels and your gut flora before and during pregnancy MD be two of DT most important prevention strategies discovered to date . For other strategies WDT can be helpful in DT prevention and treatment of NN , see “ DT autistic brain : Thinking across DT spectrum . ” ** This article ( Research confirms gut - brain connection in NN ) was originally published at Mercola.com .**"

She came down with a fever WDT lasted four days and , according to her parents , resulted in a drastic NN . “ She did not respond to her name any longer , ” says her mother , Theresa Cedillo . “ She did n’t look at PRP . She did n’t talk . ” Michelle was later diagnosed with a severe case of NN — DT neurological disorder WDT affects CD in 150 American NNS — and , 11 NNS later , her parents are still trying to figure out what went wrong . On June 11 a claim filed by DT Cedillo family against DT Department of NNP & Human Services , which maintains a fund to compensate NNS injured by NNS , went to trial in Washington , D.C. DT family claims IN thimerosal , a mercury - based preservative once common in childhood vaccinations ( PRP was phased out starting in 1999 as a precautionary measure but is still used in some NN NNS ) , in addition to their daughter ’s MMR shot , somehow triggered her NN . Their case before DT nation ’s so - called NN court is DT first of 4,800 claims linking NN and childhood shots to be heard by DT three judges . DT results are being closely watched by thousands of families desperate to understand what NNS have so far been unable to explain : What causes their NNS ’s NN ? DT debate has already turned bitter , including at DT leading advocacy group , NNP Speaks , where cofounders Bob and Suzanne Wright have clashed with their daughter Katie , who insists vaccinations caused her own son ’s NN . “ EX ’s a lot of kids in this country who have literally been poisoned by DT recommended NN program in DT NNP NNPS , ” says Wendy Fournier of DT National NNP Association . Nearly all academic and NN NNS , though , say EX is no link . A 2004 NN by DT Institute of Medicine ’s Immunization Safety Review Committee reached DT same conclusion . “ PRP MD find no evidence of a biological mechanism by which either thimerosal or MMR MD cause NN , ” says Dr. Marie McCormick of Harvard ’s School of NNP NNP , who led DT NN . While DT search for a cause continues ( see box ) , DT arguments rage on . DT Cedillos ’ attorney Kevin Conway , whose firm is handling about 1,200 NN NNS , says DT mercury in thimerosal from numerous shots , for such diseases as hepatitis B and diphtheria , suppressed Michelle ’s immune system at a vulnerable stage of development . Then , according to DT family ’s claim , Michelle received a measles NN in late 1995 , which because of DT child ’s weakened immune system was able to travel through her bloodstream to DT brain , where PRP caused inflammation and brought on NN . DT family RB blames DT measles NN for Michelle ’s severe gastrointestinal problems . Because of DT thimerosal , says Conway , “ she was unable to clear DT measles NN in DT NN [ from her system ] . ” Attorneys representing DT NN are likely to attack DT Cedillos ’ theory on several fronts . Chemicals , including DT small amounts of thimerosal once found in NNS , are typically flushed from DT body within a week , says Peter Hotez , chair of microbiology , immunology and tropical medicine at George Washington University . Dr. Samuel Katz , who helped develop DT measles shot , says , “ PRP have no evidence DT measles NN persists in DT intestines of anyone , even immune - deficient individuals . ” ( Neither Hotez nor Katz is involved in DT Cedillo case . ) A verdict in DT trial is n’t expected for up to a NN . DT Cedillos are optimistic . If PRP win , PRP stand to VB compensation from DT federal fund set up for NNS hurt by vaccinations . Claimants in non-autism NNS have won up to $ 10 million — an amount WDT MD certainly help . Theresa , 45 , a homemaker in Yuma , Ariz. , and her husband , Michael , 51 , a utility worker , spent about $ 18,000 last NN caring for Michelle , now 12 , who ca n’t walk without assistance or talk but loves watching Teletubbies and listening to music . “ I did n’t file this claim with DT intent of saying , ‘ See , I told PRP so , ' ” Theresa says . “ I ’m hopeful IN something good will come out of PRP . ”"

EX were a number of memorable moments , though , and each candidate had his or her moment , for sure . But CD candidate emerged from DT crowded field , and he just happens to be DT most unlikely of all of them : Donald NNP . DT Donald had CD of his best moments during a GOP presidential debate hosted by CNN . As NaturalNews editor and founder Mike Adams , DT NNP Ranger , reported at DT NN , DT cable channel ’s debate moderators attempted to ridicule and destroy NNP with a “ gotcha ” question about his stance on NNS and NN . As Natural NN readers are aware , a top CDC scientist has publicly confessed to taking part in DT CDC ’s fraudulent cover - up of data linking NNS to NN in African - Americans . But of course DT mainstream NN – including CNN – and DT CDC have gone to great lengths to censor DT confession , bury DT truth and continue pretending IN NNS have no links to NN whatsoever . But of all DT presidential contenders , NNP is DT only NN who has publicly expressed intelligent skepticism over DT ridiculous and potentially harmful NN schedule pushed on American NNS by a federal regulatory machine WDT is run by Big Pharma profit motives . During DT Q&A , PRP was clear IN CNN was attempting to discredit NNP over DT issue . NNP was asked a question WDT was tainted with all of DT usual pro-vaccine propaganda which claims , falsely , IN NNS carry no risk whatsoever and IN as such PRP MD not possibly be linked to higher incidents of autisms .

DT question to DT eventual GOP frontrunner essentially accused him of being too medically incompetent to make any claims whatsoever about NN care , and IN he lacked DT scientific chops as well . But when CNN posed DT question , NNP ’s answer was a thing of beauty and quite brilliant . Saying IN he is in favor of NNS in principle , he RB explained , “ But I VBP smaller doses over a longer period of NN . ” IN a number of informed pediatricians and parents , NNP is very skeptical of DT false promises made by DT Centers for NNP Control and Prevention , as well as DT NN industry WDT PRP promotes . He even went on to tell a story about NNS and NN : NN has become an epidemic … Because PRP take a baby in , and I ’ve seen PRP , and I ’ve seen PRP , and I had my NNS taken care of , over a long period of NN , over a two or three NN period of NN , same exact amount , but PRP take this little beautiful baby , and PRP pump – I mean , PRP looks just IN PRP ’s meant for a horse , not for a child , and PRP ’ve had so JJ instances , NNS WDT work for me , just DT other day , two - NNS - old , two - and - a - half - NNS - old , a child , a beautiful child went to have DT NN , and came back , and a week later got a tremendous fever , got very , very sick , now is autistic . … I ’m in favor of NNS [ but ] do them over a longer period of NN , same amount , but just in little sections . I VBP PRP ’re VBG to have – I VBP PRP ’re VBG to see a big impact on NN . Following NNP ’s answer CNN turned to CD of two actual physicians in DT crowded Republican field – genius neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson – in an obvious attempt at convincing him to attack NNP for his stance . But while professing his overall faith in NNS , Carson did say this : “ PRP are probably giving way too JJ in too short a period of NN … ” Suddenly EX were two GOP presidential contenders on DT same track – IN PRP give too JJ NNS too soon and in too large amounts . Finally , perhaps in desperation , DT CNN moderators turned to DT other physician on DT Republican panel , Sen. Rand Paul , R - Ky. , but he too , confirmed what DT Trumpster and Carson VBD : I ’m all for NNS , but I ’m RB for freedom . I ’m concerned about how PRP ’re bunched up … I ought to have DT right to spread out DT NNS a little bit … Follow all DT presidential NN this election cycle and beyond at Whitehouse . NN ."

Rather than spend more NNS in what felt IN a futile search for a malaria NN , she MD take on all mosquito - borne pathogens at once . Building on DT work of colleagues and other NNS , Manning , a clinical researcher for DT U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , believed she MD use pieces of mosquito saliva protein to build a universal NN . DT NN , if PRP pans out , MD protect against all of DT pathogens DT insects inject into humans - malaria , dengue , chikungunya , Zika , yellow fever , West Nile , Mayaro viruses and anything else WDT MD emerge . “ PRP need more innovative tools , ” VBD Manning . A NN IN this MD be “ DT Holy Grail . ” On Thursday , DT Lancet published DT initial results of this work with her colleagues : DT first - ever clinical trial of a mosquito spit NN in humans . DT trial showed IN an Anopheles mosquito - based NN was safe and IN PRP triggered antibody and cellular responses . Michael McCracken , a researcher not involved in DT NN , called DT initial results “ foundational . ” “ This is big , important work , ” VBD McCracken , who studies immune responses to mosquito - borne viruses at DT Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland . “ Mosquitoes are arguably DT deadliest animal on NNP . ” Malaria alone kills more than 400,000 NNS each NN , according to DT NNP NNP Organization . Those deaths occur mostly in poor NNS WDT do not receive as much NN research and funding . Because of JJ NN , however , those mosquitoes WDT thrive in DT tropics are moving into more NNS each NN . DT JJ disruption of DT NN - CD pandemic has brought a sharp focus to infectious diseases and NN research . CD of DT key areas of concern are pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes . DT novel NN , believed to have originated in bats , has so far infected more than 7.4 million NNS and killed nearly 420,000 worldwide . DT Asian Development Bank estimates DT pandemic MD cost DT JJ economy as much as $ 8.8 trillion . Manning ’s research is specific to mosquitoes , but is an example of how NNS are broadening their thinking about how to tackle infectious diseases , and DT JJ types of tools PRP are developing . What Manning is looking for is called a vector - based NN . A vector is DT living organism - IN a mosquito - WDT transmits a pathogen such as malaria - between humans , or from animals to humans . All existing NNS for humans target a pathogen . Manning ’s goes after DT vector . DT idea is to train DT body ’s immune system to recognize DT saliva proteins and mount a response WDT MD weaken or prevent an infection . NNS have known for decades IN mosquito spit helps establish mosquito - borne infections and enhance their severity . Just recently , NNS have begun to exploit this . A NN of macaque monkeys published in 2015 showed NN with sand fly saliva reduced leishmaniasis lesion size and parasite load . A NN of mice published in 2018 showed immunization with Anopheles mosquito spit protected against malaria . Another mouse NN published last NN showed immunization with Aedes mosquito saliva improved survival against DT Zika NN . DT NN published in DT Lancet was conducted in 2017 . DT Phase I trial conducted at DT National Institutes of NNP Clinical Center in Bethesda , Maryland , tested for safety and side effects in 49 healthy volunteers . Participants were randomly assigned to receive CD of two versions of DT NN or a placebo . After a few weeks , hungry mosquitoes were placed on DT arms of NN participants . DT NN measured immune response to DT mosquito spit proteins but did not involve pathogens . More trials are needed to determine DT effect DT mosquito spit NN MD have against actual pathogens . No systemic safety concerns were identified . CD participant developed an 8 - centimeter ( 3.15 inches ) reddened area around DT injection site and was treated with steroids and antihistamines . “ I ’m not as worried about redness as I MD be about something more systemic IN fever , headache , muscle aches , nausea or vomiting , ” VBD Stephen Thomas , an infectious diseases expert at SUNY Upstate NNP University who was not involved with DT NN . Thomas has previously worked on dengue NN programs for DT U.S. Department of Defense and helped manage its response to Ebola and DT Zika NN . Another scientist at DT University of Maryland is running a follow - up trial with more mosquito spit proteins and a different NN formulation . Meanwhile , Manning has returned to Cambodia and is running a field NN to identify NN - candidate spit proteins in Aedes mosquitoes . She RB has a separate project sequencing DT genomes of all pathogens found in Aedes and Culex mosquitoes , some of which can infect humans . CD worrying discovery so far ? “ PRP carry a ton of different viruses WDT PRP are only just discovering . ”"

This NN was detected in DT tissues of a dead blue jay from Lake County , Ohio . DT finding establishes IN WNV has arrived in Ohio . Since DT NN is present in Ohio , and DT most at risk populations are crows , blue jays , horses and NNS , PRP need to work at preventing this NN from affecting these species . According to DT Ohio WNV Work Group , most of DT efforts at preventing WNV infection are directed towards mosquito control . This can be accomplished by eliminating standing NN : NN MD collect in old tires , tin cans , plastic containers , ceramic pots , or similar containers . Clean roof gutters so PRP drain properly in DT spring and fall , clean and chlorinate swimming pools , outdoor saunas and hot tubs , and if not in use , keep empty and covered . Drain NN from pool covers . VB DT NN in bird baths at least once a week , turn over plastic wading pools , and wheelbarrows , etc. when not in use . Non-toxic products such as mosquito dunks can be used to prevent maturation of DT mosquito larvae in standing NN WDT cannot be readily eliminated . DT USDA has recently approved a conditional license for a WNV NN for equids , including horses . Dr. Dave Glauer , NNP Veterinarian , has approved DT use of DT NN in Ohio . DT NN will be available starting in September of 2001 . DT NN is made with a killed NN and has limited efficacy data , however , a similar NN for Japanese Encephalitis NN , which is closely related to WNV , has been used for JJ NNS . DT efficacy of DT Japanese Encephalitis NN has been reported at ? 80 % . NNS of WNV in horses occurred as late as October in 2000 in DT eastern NNP . Therefore , internists at DT Ohio NNP University , College of Veterinary Medicine recommend IN if DT NN is available , horses should be vaccinated twice this fall . DT NN requires an initial dose and a second dose 3 to 6 weeks later . Horse owners who are interested in vaccinating their horses for WNV should contact their local veterinarian . Veterinarians are being encouraged to place orders so DT company will have some indication of DT demand for DT NN . As part of DT safety NN of DT NN , 649 horses and ponies were vaccinated . Systemic or local reactions occurred in very few of DT vaccinated horses : 3 horses had localized site reactions ( swelling and soreness ) , 2 horses were reported to have a fever following DT initial NN only , and 2 horses had other reactions ( mild diarrhea within 8 hours of injection in 1 horse and 1 horse was treated for colic within a few hours of DT initial NN ) . According to DT report filed by Fort Dodge Animal NNP , DT NN did not induce any severe local or systemic adverse reactions in 98.5 % of DT vaccinations , therefore , DT NN appears to be safe . Horse owners planning to export their animals should be aware IN vaccinated animals MD not meet DT import requirements of receiving NNS due to DT presence of anti-WNV antibodies in blood . While these antibodies are present transiently , presence of DT antibody when DT horse is due to be exported MD result in denial of permission to import . In horses WDT do become clinically ill , DT NN infects DT central nervous system and causes signs of encephalitis . Clinical signs of encephalitis in horses include loss of appetite and depression , in addition to any combination of DT following : fever , weakness or paralysis of hind limbs , impaired vision , ataxia ( incoordination ) , head pressing , aimless wandering , convulsions , inability to swallow , circling , hyperexcitability , or coma . Differential diagnoses for neurologic NN in DT horse include rabies , botulism , equine protozoal myeloencephalitis ( EPM ) , cervical vertebral myelopathy ( CVM ) , equine herpes ( EHV1 ) , equine degenerative myelopathy ( EDM ) and other encephalitides such as western equine encephalitis ( WEE ) , eastern equine encephalitis ( EEE - reportable in Ohio ) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis ( VEE - reportable in Ohio ) , should all be considered . JJ of DT reported NNS have similar clinical signs to commonly diagnosed neurologic diseases , particularly EPM . See Ohio NNP University Web site for aids in differential diagnosis . Horse owners are encouraged not to become complacent once their horses have been vaccinated . Elimination of mosquito breeding sites and personal protection are still important . Another important role DT horse owner MD play in our efforts to prevent WNV is to continue to report dead bird sightings to their local NN department . DT local NN department will determine if those dead birds should be transported to DT Ohio Department of Agriculture for pathologic examination ."

"" EX is a disconnect between DT way in which DT NN perceives DT NN of NN and NN 's position on a variety of issues , "" VBD Alan Leshner , CEO of DT American Association for DT Advancement of Sciences ( AAAS ) , in a press conference on Wednesday ( Jan. 28 ) . In addition , DT general NN is more optimistic about DT future of NN than those working in DT trenches of scientific research , DT survey finds . But EX is some common ground : NNS and DT lay NN agree IN U.S. schoolchildren receive poorer - quality education in NN technology , engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) than do kids in other NNS , DT NN showed . [ 6 Myths About Girls and NNP ] Surveys have consistently found IN only about half of DT NN believes humans evolved from earlier animals . Other studies have found IN belief in human - caused NN NN divides sharply along political lines . But EX has been less research comparing DT views of NNS and DT general NN on a wide range of other topics . To see how NNS ' views differ from those of DT general NN , DT Pew Research Center , in conjunction with AAAS , called a random sample of 2,002 adults around DT country and asked questions about whether humans have evolved over NN ; whether genetically modified foods are safe ; and whether DT measles , mumps and rubella NN MD cause NN . DT researchers RB contacted a sample of 3,748 U.S. - based NNS who are AAAS members to ask DT same questions . PRP respondents were RB asked questions WDT touched on policy decisions and how society viewed NN and its future . On most of these issues , EX was a big gap between DT opinions of DT general NN and those of NNS . For instance , 88 percent of DT NNS VBD genetically modified foods are safe to eat , compared to just 37 percent of other adults . About 89 percent of NNS VBD PRP favored using animals in research , compared to just 42 percent of lay NNS . And though 68 percent of NNS VBD PRP was safe to eat foods grown with pesticides , only 28 percent of DT NN VBD DT same . When PRP came to NN relevant to controversial policy decisions , EX were large gaps , too . About 87 percent of DT NNS VBD NN NN is mostly due to human activities , while just half of DT NN did . More than 50 percent of DT NN VBD PRP VBP increased offshore drilling , compared to less than a third of DT NNS . And about 65 percent of NNS VBD PRP support building more nuclear power plants , compared to just 45 percent of DT NN . EX were a few areas of agreement , however : Roughly two - thirds of both NNS and DT NN VBD DT International Space Station was a good investment , and large majorities of both groups VBD PRP favor developing bioengineered fuel .

For example , DT NNP NNPS requires infants to receive 26 NNS — DT most in DT NN — yet more than six U.S. infants die per every 1000 live births . In contrast , Sweden and Japan administer 12 NNS to infants , DT least amount , and report less than three deaths per 1000 live births . DT authors of DT NN , Neil Z. Miller and Dr. Gary Goldman , conducted a literature review to determine DT immunization schedules for DT NNP NNPS and all 33 nations with better infant mortality rates than DT NNP NNPS . DT total number of NN doses specified for infants aged less than CD NN was then determined for each country . DT 34 nations were then organized into data pairs consisting of total number of NN doses specified for their infants and infant mortality rates . A scatter plot of DT data pairs provided evidence of a positive correlation : infant mortality rates and NN doses tend to increase together . Nations were RB grouped into five different NN dose ranges . DT mean infant mortality rates of all nations within each group were then calculated . Analysis showed “ a high statistically significant correlation between increasing number of NN doses and increasing infant mortality rates . ” PRP is instructive to note IN JJ developing nations require their infants to receive multiple NN doses and have national NN coverage rates ( a percentage of DT target population WDT has been vaccinated ) of 90 % or better , yet their infant mortality rates are poor . Infant mortality rates will remain high in nations WDT cannot provide clean NN , proper nutrition , improved sanitation , and better access to NN care . Nations with higher ( worse ) infant mortality rates give their infants , on average , more NN doses . This positive correlation , derived from DT data , elicits an important inquiry : Are some infant deaths associated with over - NN ? Is PRP possible IN some nations are requiring too JJ NNS for their infants and DT additional NNS are a toxic burden on their NN ? Stock up with Fresh Food WDT lasts with eFoodsDirect ( AD ) EX is some evidence IN a subset of infants MD be more susceptible to SIDS shortly after being vaccinated . For example , Torch found IN unvaccinated babies who died of SIDS did so most often in DT fall or winter while vaccinated babies died most often at 2 and 4 months — DT same ages when initial doses of DPT were given to infants . He concluded IN DPT “ MD be a generally unrecognized major cause of sudden infant and early childhood death , and IN DT risks of immunization MD outweigh its potential benefits . ” PRP appears as though some infant deaths attributed to SIDS MD be NN related , perhaps associated with biochemical or synergistic toxicity due to over - NN . All nations have an obligation to determine whether their immunization schedules are achieving their desired goals .

PRP see , PRP ’s politically expedient right now , with NNP NNP in office , for DT Leftist Mob to highlight every single mainstream NN NN item about illegals WDT makes DT Commander - in - Chief look IN a monster . First PRP was NNS “ in cages ; ” then PRP was NNS dying ; then PRP was NNS trying to escape tear gas ; and so on and so forth . For visual manipulation purposes , these libtards have discovered IN spreading images of NNS crying next to border patrol pickup trucks or lying on DT floor behind fencing makes those “ resisting ” NNP appear noble and virtuous – because only a tyrant MD allow such things ( even though JJ of DT images being circulated were actually taken while Obama was in office ) . Nevertheless , DT dumbest segments of DT left - leaning population seem to fall for this fake NN every single NN – and yet PRP ’re nowhere to be found in defending American NNS from much worse threats , IN compulsory NN . As PRP reported back in 2015 , for instance , California Senator Richard Pan , a Democrat , single - handedly eliminated exemption provisions in DT Golden NNP allowing parents to opt their NNS out of compulsory NN for personal and philosophical reasons , and DT Leftist Mob was quick to storm DT streets in protest , right ? Wrong . Even though NNS harm and injure tens of thousands of American NNS every single NN , almost nobody on DT Left has ever VBN a thing about this mass genocide masquerading as “ medicine . ” Similarly , DT Left is completely silent when PRP comes to DT JJ American NNS who have been raped and killed by DT precious illegal aliens whom PRP MD seem to make their number - CD priority . Why is this , PRP ’re probably asking ? Because DT Left has devolved into little more than a herd of mindless , brainwashed sheep . Those who listen to what DT likes of MSNBC and CNN have to say about NN events have been programmed to believe IN enforcing immigration laws is “ evil , ” but injecting NNS with deadly chemicals WDT impair them for life , or in JJ NNS kill them , is perfectly fine . NNP NNP is DT first NN in recent history to actually make protecting American lives a top priority PRP ’s a pandemic of cognitive dissonance and flat - out willful ignorance on DT part of these virtue - signaling phonies , who seem entirely unable to discern good from evil . Keep in mind IN NNP NNP , whom JJ of these Leftists believe to be “ literally Hitler , ” is actually DT first NN in recent history to actually make Americans a priority rather than illegal aliens and other special interest groups . This was made evident back in December when NNP NNP ’s Department of NNP and Human Services ( HHS ) announced plans to implement a “ Conscience and Religious Freedom Division ” WDT MD eliminate mandatory NN nationwide – and this was all done under DT directive of NNP NNP himself . NNP NNP is similarly standing his ground in ensuring IN an effective border wall is constructed between DT NNP NNPS and Mexico to prevent illicit drugs , human trafficking , and other heinous evils from continuing to move back and forth across DT border – again an indication IN he cares for Americans and wants to protect them from DT plight of globalism . But DT Left is unable to see any of this , unfortunately , and MD rather pretend as though DT NN is sitting RB in DT Oval Office laughing with his pinky in DT air IN Dr. Evil as illegal immigrant NNS are being sniped by Border Patrol . PRP ’s NNP Derangement Syndrome to DT max , and PRP does n’t appear to be letting up anytime soon ."

The_DT future_NN of_IN civilization_NN might_MD very_RB well_RB depend_VB on_IN it_PRP ._.","DT 2010s are over , and DT double - 20s are about to begin . CD phrase WDT I 'd VB to never hear again is "" post - truth era , "" an idea WDT has gained prominence during DT past decade , especially DT last few NNS . CD dominant theme of post - truthery is IN every person has a right to his / her own interpretation of DT facts , and IN these alternative interpretations–or "" alternative facts , ” as NNP adviser Kellyanne Conway famously called them –deserve to be taken seriously . PRP do n't . And yet , IN most of DT pseudoscience WDT I 've been writing about for NNS now , PRP have to continue calling out nonsense for what PRP is , because some of PRP is harmful , and even deadly . Politics is a never - ending font of post - truthery ( or truthiness , as Stephen Colbert defined PRP in 2005 ) , but here I 'm concerned about NN . Today I 'll highlight three anti-truth campaigns WDT have caused great harm over DT past decades , in DT hope IN PRP will soon fade away . Among serious NNS , truth is not being questioned . Indeed , DT essence of NN is DT search for objective truth . Sometimes , though , a scientific discovery threatens to undermine DT power or profits of an influential industry , and DT 's when industry resorts to denialism ( which is essentially DT same thing as post - truthiness ) . Perhaps DT most well - documented example of organized NN denialism dates back to DT 1950s , when accumulating evidence made PRP clear IN smoking causes cancer . DT tobacco industry did n't VB to admit this , even though their own internal research supported PRP , because PRP meant IN their main product was killing their customers , which in turn was terrible NN for their business . In response , Eventually , after decades of lawsuits and literally millions of smoking - related deaths , DT industry was forced to admit DT truth and pay out billions of dollars in settlements in DT U.S. Nonetheless , JJ NNS still smoke , and even as recently as 2016 , DT largest tobacco company in DT U.S. , Philip Morris , was still trying to deny DT NN about cigarettes . My second example is more recent , and potentially even more harmful to DT human species . PRP might have already guessed PRP : I 'm talking about NN NN denialism . For several decades , DT evidence has been building IN DT NN is getting warmer . A series of reports from DT Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) warned , in increasingly confident terms , IN humans were DT primary cause of recent NN , mostly due to our use of fossil fuels and DT carbon PRP emit into DT atmosphere . DT current IPCC report VBZ unequivocally IN humans have already caused 1° C of NN , and IN DT NN will increase rapidly over DT next several decades . Scientifically , these facts are not in dispute . DT NN is already experiencing more severe storms , unprecedented floods and droughts , and die - offs due to NN oceans ( such as DT massive and tragic die - off of coral in Great Barrier Reef ) . However , DT fossil fuel industry sees JJ NN as a threat to their profits . Rather than invest in JJ , cleaner forms of NN , large companies such as Exxon - Mobil and billionaire coal magnates such as DT Koch brothers have poured countless millions of dollars into disinformation campaigns to cast doubt on DT NN of NN NN . Prominent among these efforts is DT Heartland Institute , a fossil - fuel - funded organization whose main mission is to cast doubt on DT NN of NN NN . ( Heartland has RB worked to cast doubt on DT link between smoking and cancer . ) NN NN denialists learned from DT tobacco companies IN PRP was possible to delay NN action by decades , simply by casting doubt on DT NN . Unfortunately , their campaigns have been working . For NNS , JJ U.S. politicians denied IN DT NN was getting warmer . As DT argument has become increasingly harder to make with a straight face , PRP 've changed their strategy , and now PRP might admit IN DT NN is heating up , but deny IN human activities are responsible . PRP 're still wrong . DT goal of this denialism is , simply put , to protect DT profits of fossil fuel industries . However , truth does n't care if PRP believe PRP or not . DT NN is getting hotter . Australia just had its four hottest days in recorded history . DT unprecedented heat wave has led to hundreds of fires through much of DT country , threatening every major city on DT continent . EX 's no reason to VB this wo n't keep happening . NN NN denialists are only fooling themselves –after being duped by oil and coal companies . My third and final example is CD WDT has frustrated me for 15 NNS now , and PRP ’s CD WDT just wo n't VB away : DT anti-vaccination movement . This is CD of DT most frustrating examples of post - truth wrongheadedness , in part PRP seems so unnecessary , and because so JJ NNS have been harmed as a result . First , let 's be clear about DT facts : NNS are CD of DT greatest boons to human NN in DT history of NN and medicine . NNS used to die by DT millions from smallpox , polio , and a dozen other infections WDT are now almost completely preventable by NNS . Smallpox was 100 % eliminated from DT NN in 1980 , in CD of humankind 's greatest JJ NN triumphs . Polio has now been eradicated from nearly all NNS , and a campaign WDT started in 1988 has now reduced polio to just a few NNS and fewer than 100 NNS worldwide . Both of these successes are due to NNS . JJ other diseases , including measles , chicken pox , and bacterial meningitis , have been reduced so dramatically by NNS WDT physicians in DT U.S. and Europe almost never see a case . This graph shows DT dramatic effect of DT measles NN , which was introduced in DT U.S. in DT early 1960s : DT graph shows DT number of reported NNS , but actual NNS were much higher , likely around 4 million NNS per NN by CD estimate . These are DT facts . So what happened ? DT modern anti-vax movement , led by a small number of extremely vocal , extremely self - confident individuals , began in 1998 with DT publication of a fraudulent NN ( later retracted when DT fraud was uncovered ) claiming IN NNS caused NN . DT NN was led by former physician Andrew Wakefield , who later lost his JJ license because of his fraud , which included misleading his co-authors and mistreating patients . Nonetheless , this NN was picked up and amplified by several celebrities with large followings , including former Playboy model and MTV host Jenny McCarthy and political activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr , DT nephew of former NNP NNP John Kennedy . RFK Jr . Anti-vax activism is all over DT web today , despite JJ efforts to quash PRP . Countless claims of "" my child got sick after his NN jab "" are presented as proof IN NNS cause harm , and under post - truthism , PRP 're supposed to take such claims seriously . These stories can be especially difficult to respond to , because JJ parents are dealing with NNS who have genuine NN problems –including autism–and DT parents often truly believe what PRP are saying . Thus PRP wo n't do to tell them to be quiet and VB away : their NNS really do need JJ care . PRP 're simply wrong in believing IN NNS have anything to do with their childrens ' problems . Their beliefs are amplified by Facebook groups and websites whose sole purpose is to echo and amplify DT mistaken claims of anti-vaxxers . Even though EX was never any good evidence IN NNS cause NN , NNS have conducted dozens of studies involving literally millions of NNS to answer precisely DT question , and DT evidence is very , very clear : NNS do not cause NN , nor do PRP cause any other systematic neurological or behavioral problems . NNS do prevent diseases , though , and unvaccinated NNS can and will VB sick . Recent experience has RB given PRP , tragically , JJ examples of NNS who died from entirely preventable infections , because their parents did n't vaccinate them . These tragedies did n't have to happen . Every era is DT age of truth . DT idea IN PRP 're in a "" post - truth era , "" despite being repeated thousands of times in articles , essays , and op - eds over DT past decade , is a commentary on NNS 's ability to fool themselves , not on DT NN of DT NN . Truth describes DT NN as PRP is , and those who choose to deny PRP might win a short - term argument , but in DT long term , PRP will always lose . Finally , on a more positive note , I 'm somewhat heartened by efforts to educate college students on how to recognize and counter bogus ideas , such as DT University of Washington course , Calling Bullshit , created by Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West . ( Yes , DT really is its title . ) As DT professors wrote : If PRP 're interested , PRP 've made DT lectures available as free videos on YouTube . Labelling an era as post - anything has always , to me , suggested a lack of substance , as if DT era is defined only by what came before PRP . DT use of "" post - "" RB ignores DT fact IN DT next era will need a name too . Should PRP expect "" post - post - truth "" to come next ? And what MD DT look IN ? Let 's hope IN DT 2020s will give PRP a return to simple respect for truth . DT future of civilization might very well depend on PRP ."

Reflect On : Why did PRP lie for NNS about this ? Why did PRP conduct a massive NN campaign shaming those WDT questioned NNS ? Why did PRP invent DT term ‘ anti- vaxxer ’ to put NNS who question NNS in a negative light ? This is truly a bombshell story when PRP understand DT full implications of PRP , yet major NN likely will not touch PRP . Headlines MD read “ In stunning lawsuit , CDC admits PRP have no evidence NNS do n’t cause NN ” – but instead , crickets . Independent NN organizations IN CE are left to have to tell these stories , and at DT same NN risk more demonetization for telling DT truth IN DT NN should VB . Of course , PRP RB VBP IN since independent NN ’s reach has been cut , getting stories IN this out is very hard and relies on PRP , DT dear reader , to spread DT word . As of March 2nd , 2020 , DT CDC has admitted in federal court IN PRP do not have any evidence proving IN NNS given to babies do n’t cause NN . For NNS PRP claimed IN DT studies had been done , DT evidence was clear , and IN EX was a consensus : “ NNS do n’t cause NN . ” Yet , this was a lie . An organization called DT Informed Consent Action Network ( ICAN ) was instrumental in bringing forth this admission . As PRP stated in their own press release : In summer 2019 , ICAN submitted a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request to DT CDC requesting “ All studies relied upon by CDC to claim IN DT DTaP NN does not cause NN . ” ICAN RB submitted this same request for HepB , Hib , PCV13 and IPV , as well as requesting DT CDC provide studies to support DT cumulative exposure to these NNS during DT first six months of life do not cause NN . Despite months of demands , DT CDC failed to produce a single specific NN in response to these FOIA requests . ICAN was therefore forced to sue DT CDC in federal court , where DT CDC finally conceded , in a stipulation signed by a Federal court judge , IN IN PRP has no studies to support IN any of these NNS do not cause NN . In short , DT CDC provided a list of studies WDT were to claim NNS did not cause NN , only , none of these studies proved DT . Part of DT list was a recent review by DT Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) , which was paid for by DT CDC . This NN performed a comprehensive review of studies relating to DT DTaP NN . PRP was looking to determine whether or not DT NN does or does not cause NN . DT IOM was unable to identify a single NN to support IN DTaP does not cause NN . What PRP did find was a single NN WDT did show an association between DTaP and NN . So for NNS , DT CDC falsely claimed IN “ NNS do n’t cause NN . ” This was based on no evidence , no studies , no NN , just speculation . In turn , those WDT questioned NNS were called anti-vaxxers , unscientific and extreme about their views , yet were PRP wrong to claim IN NNS MD cause NN and IN PRP do n’t feel PRP are safe ? PRP does n’t seem to be DT case when PRP consider IN a look at DT NN and evidence available suggests PRP ’s highly likely IN vaccinees do play a role in NN . This , as PRP VBP now , has not been debunked nor fully proven . DT detail WDT hits close to home for PRP here at CE is DT fact - checkers have been handing out false claims about our NN content , stating IN “ NNS do n’t cause NN . ” This has led to a reduction in our reach and DT near - complete destruction of our business due to demonetization . Yet , where did these fact - checkers VB their information from ? DT CDC . And now PRP VBP , DT CDC never had DT evidence to make DT claims PRP made , and DT fact - checkers were in fact wrong or truly misinformed . These false claims from DT CDC have RB effectively led to creating a culture of blind NN acceptance even though EX is no evidence PRP are safe . This leads to DT challenge not JJ are realizing about fact - checking organizations IN Snopes , or DT ones WDT work on Facebook ; what PRP do , is turn to major organizations and DT NN to VB their ‘ facts . ’ And those facts overrule anything brought forth WDT challenges those ‘ facts . ’ So essentially fact - checkers are merely purveyors of facts produced by governments and major corporations . Some RB happen to be paid by major corporations . EX is an abundance of NN showing IN NNS MD be linked to NN , in JJ different ways . Take aluminum for example , A NN published in 2018 discovered high amounts of aluminum in DT brain tissue of NNS with NN : DT fact IN aluminum in adjuvant form does not exit DT body as aluminum in our own food , for example , is CD of multiple ways IN NNS have shown how NNS MD be implicated in DT aetiology of NN . PRP can read more about NNS and aluminum specifically , here . This is not DT first NN in history IN major NN organizations , NNS and doctors claimed IN something was safe when PRP was n’t . Look at cigarettes , agent orange , and DDT . These were just a few WDT became common knowledge after JJ NNS brought awareness forward about DT dangers associated with these products . All DT while , DT companies who owned them , and their cronies fought to claim these NNS were unscientific , liars and wrong . Are PRP seeing this now with NNS ? PRP sure seems to be following DT same pattern . CD thing I always look at is if major organizations cannot answer DT simple question , and instead turn to ridicule , name - calling and NN campaigns to cast doubt , then PRP VBP PRP are hiding something . In my feeling , DT CDC knows full well DT dangers of NNS , and PRP are buying NN to figure out how to keep themselves clean for when DT cards fall . Because PRP will . Disclaimer : PRP at Prepare for NN ( PFC ) bring PRP information WDT is not offered by DT mainstream NN , and therefore MD seem controversial . DT opinions , views , statements , and / or information PRP present are not necessarily promoted , endorsed , espoused , or agreed to by Prepare for NNP , its leadership Council , members , those who work with PFC , or those who read its content . However , PRP are hopefully provocative . Please use discernment ! Use logical thinking , your own intuition and your own connection with Source , Spirit and Natural Laws to help PRP determine what is true and what is not . By sharing information and seeding dialogue , PRP is our goal to raise consciousness and awareness of higher truths to free PRP from enslavement of DT matrix in this material realm ."

JJ OMPFs contain both personnel and former active duty NN records , but DT service branches discontinued retiring DT NN record portion to DT NPRC in DT 1990s . In DT past , all of DT military services retired DT individual NN record , along with DT personnel record , to DT NPRC upon a service member 's separation from service . DT Army and DT Air Force retired its NN records with DT Official Military Personnel File , while DT Department of DT Navy ( including DT Navy , Marine Corps and Coast Guard ) retired these files separately to DT NPRC until DT 1980s . NN records cover DT outpatient , dental and mental NN treatment WDT former members received while in military service . NN records include induction and separation physical examinations , as well as routine JJ care ( doctor / dental visits , lab tests , etc. ) when DT patient was not admitted to a hospital . In comparison , clinical ( hospital inpatient ) records were generated when active duty members were actually hospitalized while in DT service . Typically , these records are NOT filed with DT NN records but are generally retired to DT NPRC by DT facility which created them ( see clinical records for more information ) . JJ records from DT Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) are RB not included . In DT 1990s , DT military services discontinued DT practice of filing NN records with DT personnel record portion at DT NPRC .

In order to determine where a JJ record is located , please see DT chart below : Veterans who plan to file a claim for JJ benefits with DT Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) do not need to request a copy of their military NN record from DT NPRC . After a claim is filed , DT VA will obtain DT original NN record from DT NPRC . In addition , JJ NN records were lent to DT Department of Veterans Affairs prior to DT 1973 Fire .

A Stanford University JJ research group led by Robert Sapolsky has been working on PRP . Of course , this development is heralded in DT mainstream NN ( MSM ) as yet another modern JJ miracle . This latest NN nightmare focuses on a few physiological biochemical events within DT endocrine system as an attempt to prevent chronic stress from harming DT immune system . But injecting NNS containing foreign particles , heavy metals , and viruses into our bodies has been proven to harm immunity short and long - term . Even if NN contents were safe , DT antigens WDT indicate a NN ’s assumed success do n’t provide real immunization . This proposed stress cure bypasses what NNS should do to relieve stress naturally or by directly addressing their emotional and mental NN . But vaccinating DT population against stress MD serve as a terrific adjunct to fluorides for maintaining a docile , chronically sick society . Robert Sapolsky spent some NN in DT African wild circa 1980 amongst a baboon population , whose hierarchal behavior was viciously unpredictable , making life uncertain for DT ones dependent on alpha baboons . Sapolsky observed IN JJ of DT baboons , dependent on DT alpha rascals , appeared thin and unhealthy . Sapolsky used tranquilizer darts on them to be able to draw blood , and he measured their fight or flight hormone blood levels . Sure enough , PRP were high . More importantly , blood analyses showed a direct link with other markers of a damaged immune system and bad NN . At DT NN of Sapolsky ’s baboon research , mainstream medicine did n’t consider stress an important factor for bad NN . He helped bring more awareness to stress , especially chronic stress , as a factor for all NN . DT was a good thing . But his NN solution , mired in DT AMA - Big Pharma paradigm , is only a good thing for his and Big Pharma ’s bottom line . Sapolsky and his research team focused on a way to circumvent glucosteroid hormones WDT create stress . PRP bio-engineered a herpes NN , ostensibly eliminating its dangers while supposedly preserving DT NN ’ inherent neuro - protective genes . This is aimed toward artificially meddling with DT endocrine system . This bio-engineered NN combined with all WDT ’s necessary to preserve and boost a NN creates a dangerously unpredictable cocktail for injecting directly into DT bloodstream . From around 1985 to now , EX has been an explosion of chronic stress in our modern NN . DT unpredictability of managing to lead a safe and secure life has risen dramatically . More NNS are realizing PRP have to simplify their lives . Arguing and fighting less domestically or on DT job is CD solution for reducing stress . Robert Sapolsky observed how baboons WDT walked , not ran , away from fights seemed to be healthier . Practicing hatha yoga with special attention to DT “ corpse pose ” WDT wraps up a session works wonders . Peaceful , self discipline applied with meditation offers a long - term solution to coping with DT chronic , stressful conditions surrounding PRP . Meditation practiced daily has been clinically proven to reduce even cardiac NN probabilities connected to stress . Practicing taichi and chi-gong to reduce stress and improve NN has caught on more over DT last few decades . Short term solutions are available with herbal and homeopathic remedies WDT help relieve stress and depression . Acupuncture can be applied to reduce stress . Aldous Huxley once argued by mail with George Orwell over their visions of futuristic NN NN tyranny . Huxley posited a pharmaceutically conditioned population , easily controlled with minimal force , while Orwell saw mind control and force as DT controlling factors . Unfortunately , PRP were both right . http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/07/ff About DT author : Paul Fassa is dedicated to warning others about DT current corruption of food and medicine and guiding others toward a direction for better NN with no restrictions on NN freedom .

These MD all seem unrelated , but according to macroeconomic researcher Rob Kirby , PRP are all connected . Kirby explains , “ With NNP and their upstart CIPS , which is DT NNP Interbank Payment System , NNP appears to be on DT verge of merging their interbank payment system with SWIFT . My gut is telling me IN this will very much marginalize America as DT main processor of JJ payments . This , in my view , will embody very possibly a JJ reset in terms which currency is VBG to be DT NN ’s reserve currency . I have a very sneaking suspicion IN when NNP merges with DT SWIFT system , I believe EX is a very strong possibility IN NNP will back their currency with gold . I do believe this is why NNP has aggressively been buying physical gold for DT past 10 or 15 NNS . PRP have been doing PRP with a view to dislodging DT dollar or greatly diminishing DT dollar as DT NN ’s reserve currency . DT ’s what I VBP is at play right now . I VBP U.S. bankers and regulators have caught wind of this and are aware PRP is coming . I RB believe this is DT reason for all DT secret meetings PRP have been having . DT Federal Reserve Board met in secret behind closed doors ( Monday morning ) , and PRP gave PRP some frivolous reason why PRP were meeting . DT Fed Chairman , DT Monday afternoon , walked over to DT White House and met with , not just DT NNP , but RB DT Vice NNP . DT notion IN DT NNP and Vice NNP MD be in DT same room at DT same NN tells PRP this is national security related . If PRP do n’t VB DT preservation of DT dollar as DT NN ’s reserve currency is n’t a national security issue , PRP better VB again . ” MD EX be a dramatic and overnight reduction in DT value of DT dollar ? Kirby contends , “ I VBP this is coming in very short order now . DT trail of bread crumbs is indicating this is what is afoot right now . ” Does DT mean dollar devaluation and a bank “ holiday ” coming soon ? Kirby says , “ How quickly this happens is open for conjecture , but DT is clearly DT direction PRP are heading . PRP are unmistakably headed in DT direction . DT only real question is how long these criminal central bankers can MacGyver DT system together and keep PRP together with elastic bands , paperclips and bungie cords . This is VBG down . This is VBG to happen . I VBP PRP ’s VBG down in DT next two or three weeks . . . . PRP ’ve all speculated IN this MD eventually happen . Now PRP are here , and DT clock is about to strike midnight . ” What have DT NNP and DT VP been told by DT Fed Chairman in these emergency meetings this week ? Kirby says , “ My guess is PRP are probably explaining to them just how deep DT pooh is IN PRP are about to be thrown into . PRP ’s deep , and PRP ’s VBG to be over their heads . . . . Historically , when banks have nothing else PRP can do , PRP take PRP to war . ” If PRP do n’t take PRP to war ? Kirby says , “ Everything is on DT table . . . . My thinking is EX are an awful lot of U.S. dollars out RB right now WDT are VBG to be coming home to America . . . . DT adjustment in JJ reserve accounts MD create a tsunami of dollars coming back to America in a very , very short period of NN . DT MD trigger something approaching a hyperinflationary event or , at least , stagflation and super inflationary pressure . DT ’s DT minimum occurring very , very soon . ” About DT recent revelation of Deutsche Bank suppressing DT price of physical gold and silver ? Kirby points out , “ DT price rigging ultimately comes back to and will be shown IN PRP really is an operation of DT U.S. Treasury and DT U.S. Federal Reserve . . . . DT short interests , or DT paper sales of precious metals , have been used on purpose to suppress DT growing demand for precious metals , or to make PRP appear IN NNS are still happy with dollars and do n’t prefer precious metals to dollars . . . . Whether DT U.S. central bank declares IN gold or silver are not money in some hubris filled silliness does n’t diminish DT fact IN gold and silver are money , and your U.S. Constitution says gold and silver are money . ” Join Greg Hunter as he goes CD - on - CD in a pivotal interview with Rob Kirby of KirbyAnalytics.com . Kirby RB adds , DT globalists hate and fear a NNP Presidency because he will unwind DT anti-American secret trade deals IN DT TPP .

Sixty - two unarmed Palestinian demonstrators were shot dead and nearly three thousand more were injured by gunfire and tear gas versus no Israelis killed or wounded while a leading Knesset parliamentarian has assured DT NN IN DT Army has plenty of bullets left to kill all DT Gazans if necessary . DT White House , however , has obviously not seen DT video footage of DT slaughter , and was instead celebrating DT opening of DT JJ American Embassy in Jerusalem intended to coincide with DT 70th Anniversary of DT creation of Israel , which some might RB refer to as DT 70th anniversary of DT ethnic cleansing of DT Palestinian Christians and Muslims .

A short NN later someone named Raj Shah at DT White House told reporters at a press briefing IN “ DT responsibility for these tragic deaths rests squarely with Hamas .

To be sure , some Democratic Congressman have expressed horror over what has been taking place . Barbara Lee , Betty McCollum and Bernie Sanders have all spoken up . Sanders VBD IN “ Israel should be condemned . ” Congressman Mark Pocan declared IN “ EX are better ways to deal with DT tensions in Gaza than bullets . ” Pocan and Raúl Grijalva , Pramila Jayapal , Keith Ellison , and Hank Johnson all expressed shock and dismay at “ DT lethal force used by Israeli troops against mostly unarmed protesters demonstrating at Gaza ’s border . ” PRP asked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s NN to “ show utmost restraint , allow for unfettered JJ attention for those who have been wounded , and ease DT 12 - NN blockade on Gaza , which has contributed to grave food insecurity , unemployment and a humanitarian crisis for Gaza ’s two million inhabitants . ” Congressmen Johnson and Pocan as well as Dan Kildee of Michigan have recently called for DT Israeli NN to permit them to enter DT Palestinian region to see what is happening on DT ground RB . DT three congressmen visited Israel in 2016 but were blocked from crossing into DT Gaza Strip by DT Israeli Coordination and Liaison Administration , which operates DT borders and entry points , limiting who can enter and leave as well as DT flow of such essentials as food supplies . PRP might astonish some Americans to learn IN Israel can stop any U.S. Congressmen from entering Gaza , which Tel Aviv illogically claims is no longer under its control even though PRP has turned DT area into an outdoor prison camp . CD notes particularly DT lack of even a single Republican concerned over DT completely disproportionate carnage in Gaza . Senator Rand Paul , who CD referred to Israeli controlled Gaza as a “ concentration camp , ” is notable by his absence . Senators Ten Cruise , Lindsey Graham , Dean Heller and Mike Lee ( a bit of a surprise WDT , but he is a Mormon ) were all part of DT official delegation , which RB included a number of GOP House members as well as Florida governor Rick Scott . Regarding DT Democrats , PRP has long been observed IN DT party base does not any longer support DT philo - Israel policies embraced by DT Clintonesque Democratic National Committee leadership . Those congressmen who have spoken out certainly deserve DT NN ’s support when PRP find Israel ’s behavior just too much to take . PRP MD have been refreshing to see more Congressmen criticizing Israel for what are indisputably war crimes in using live fire against unarmed demonstrators . And PRP should use DT same blunt language PRP use when criticizing Russia or North Korea or Iran . Unfortunately , even when EX have been comments or statements WDT express some concern , PRP are inevitably and invariably wrapped in excuses for Israel ’s inhumane actions , referring to provocative protests “ organized by Hamas , ” a claim WDT is pure Israeli propaganda , and / or blaming “ all sides , ” which again distributes DT fault to make Israel look IN a victim as well as DT Gazans . PRP is typical newspeak intended to avoid making Israel and its friends unhappy . DT truth is IN what Israel does in its own neighborhood endangers DT NNP NNPS and makes every American who travels through DT Middle East a target . I recently returned from a conference in Iran and , as DT Gaza tragedy was unfolding , PRP American participants were all wondering if PRP MD make PRP home . PRP considered IN Israel , bent on a war with Iran WDT MD drag DT U.S. in to do DT real fighting , might just choose their moment of apparent strength with DT JJ Embassy and DT “ successful ” slaughter of DT Palestinians without so much as a peep out of DT White House , as a good NN to escalate . How JJ civilian airliners might VB shot down ? How JJ more Palestinians will have to die for DT monstrous Benjamin Netanyahu ’s blood lust truly to be satisfied ?"

PRP 's now uncommon in DT UK because of DT effectiveness of NN . Anyone can VB measles if PRP have not been vaccinated or have not had PRP before , although PRP 's most common in young NNS . DT infection usually clears in around 7 to 10 days . DT initial symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after PRP 're infected . • cold - JJ symptoms , such as a runny nose , sneezing and a cough • sore , red eyes WDT MD be sensitive to light • a high temperature ( fever ) , which MD reach around 40 C • small greyish - white spots on DT inside of DT cheeks A few days later , a red - brown blotchy rash will appear . This usually starts on DT head or upper neck before spreading outwards to DT rest of DT body . At DT moment PRP can be hard to VB what to do if your child is unwell . PRP 's important to trust your instincts and VB JJ help if PRP need PRP . When to see a GP PRP should contact a GP as soon as possible if PRP suspect IN PRP or your child MD have measles . PRP 's best to phone before your visit as your GP surgery MD need to make arrangements to reduce DT risk of spreading DT infection to others . PRP should RB see a GP if PRP have been in close contact with someone who has measles and have not : • been fully vaccinated with 2 doses of DT MMR NN • had DT infection before PRP should do this even if PRP do not have any symptoms . Measles can be unpleasant , but will usually pass in about 7 to 10 days without causing any further problems . Once PRP have had measles , your body builds up resistance ( immunity ) to DT NN and it's highly unlikely PRP 'll VB PRP again . But PRP can lead to serious and potentially life - threatening complications in some NNS . These include infections of DT lungs ( pneumonia ) and brain ( encephalitis ) . DT measles NN is contained in DT millions of tiny droplets WDT come out of DT nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes . PRP can easily catch measles by : • touching a surface DT droplets have settled on and then placing your hands near your nose or mouth ( DT NN can survive on surfaces for a few hours ) NNS with measles are infectious from when DT symptoms develop until about 4 days after DT rash first appears . How measles can be prevented Measles can be prevented by having DT measles , mumps and rubella ( MMR ) NN . This is given in 2 doses as part of DT NHS childhood NN programme . DT first dose is given when your child is around 13 months old , and a second dose is given at 3 NNS and 4 months . Adults and older NNS can be vaccinated at any age if PRP have not been fully vaccinated before . Ask a GP about having DT NN . If DT MMR NN is not suitable for PRP , a treatment called human normal immunoglobulin ( HNIG ) can be used if PRP 're at immediate risk of catching measles . How PRP can ease DT symptoms of measles EX are several things PRP can do to help relieve your symptoms and reduce DT risk of spreading DT infection . • taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve fever , aches and pains ( aspirin should not be given to NNS under 16 NNS old ) • closing DT curtains to help reduce light sensitivity • using damp cotton wool to clean DT eyes • staying off school or work for at least 4 days from when DT rash first appears In severe NNS , especially if EX are complications , PRP or your child MD need to be admitted to hospital for treatment ."

On 23 April DT first European human trials began at a lab in Oxford ; around 800 NNS were recruited to take part . Now , on 16 June , Imperial College is starting a human trial in 300 volunteers . A further 10,000 volunteers are RB wanted across England , Wales and Scotland . Jack Sommers was CD of DT first to have DT jab on DT Oxford trial three weeks ago . [ This piece was originally published on 6 June ] . PRP ’s been a month since I first signed up for DT NN NN trials . I was paid a grand total of £ 235 for five hospital visits , various needles to be stuck in my arm , and generally to be used as a human guinea pig , all in DT hope I MD help to develop DT much - discussed NN - CD NN . Nothing has been talked up as our potential saviour more than DT Oxford University NN trial , CD of scores being developed around DT NN . DT NN has been repeatedly cited as DT best hope of returning PRP to our pre-Covid lives and DT UK NN is seriously invested ; PRP pledged a combined £ 43 million to UK - based laboratories rolling out human testing . DT first phase , which I was part of , took place in England last month . Now PRP ’re expanding PRP to ask tens of thousands of Brits across DT country to take part and put themselves in DT same position as me in DT coming weeks . If PRP do sign up , prepare for DT process to be more mundane than PRP might expect . A NN trial combines a lot of admin , IN signing up for a bank account but with DT light trepidation of having your holiday jabs . PRP apply via an online questionnaire and will be asked every conceivable question about your NN history and your family . Once approved , PRP ’ll be called to DT hospital . DT first NN I went to St George ’s in south London I had been self - isolating in my flat for two months ; I live alone and am recently unemployed . I found myself in a waiting room surrounded by other NNS I presumed were RB for DT same reason ( DT only other test subjects I VBP of are three macaque monkeys ) . Despite our common bond DT awkward GP - surgery atmosphere meant PRP did n’t talk . On this first visit PRP are required to give urine and blood samples , fill out forms and watch a video about how PRP ’re expecting PRP ’ll only VB mild side effects . Then PRP VBP home to await DT green light once everything checks out . In DT meantime be prepared for your friends and family to have endless questions , including JJ wrongly assuming PRP will be exposed to NN as part of DT trial – PRP wo n’t . I have found myself inundated with well wishes ( and a few NN theorists online too ) . Two days after my first hospital visit I sent a frantic follow - up email asking why I had n’t yet had DT call to return for DT injection . DT reply basically VBD : ‘ Calm down and wait ’ . PRP was at this point I started feeling nervous for DT first NN . I was called and returned to DT hospital – although I was anxious PRP was RB DT closest I had come to a normal workplace in weeks . PRP was a tantalising reminder of life pre-lockdown ( despite DT sterile atmosphere ) . My nostalgia quickly evaporated as a nurse started talking about DT NNS given to DT rhesus macaques ; I salute DT monkey 's sacrifices for JJ NN but DT serene ‘ guinea pig ’ image in my head was now well and truly gone . I thought back to a few messages I had had from NNS shielding , including CD woman with multiple sclerosis who told me : “ PRP are doing something WDT MD help millions of NNS ” . This made me , a grown man who does n’t VB needles and puts a hand in front of his face during horror films , feel fearless . DT injection itself – DT only dose PRP receive – was painless . I was given a thermometer and asked to record my symptoms daily through an online diary . My biggest side effect seems to have been paranoia . I do n’t VB whether I was in DT 50 per cent given DT actual NN or 50 per cent given a control , but twice in DT first week I went to bed with mild fever symptoms , which I MD , in retrospect , have imagined . “ Raised temperature and sneezing , ” I wrote in DT diary ’s text box on day three with DT solemn resignation PRP might use to telegraph IN DT Titanic had struck an iceberg . Given my temperature DT day was a perfectly normal 36.5 degrees , my narrative did n’t always quite match reality . As DT weeks have gone on I ’ve not suffered any further symptoms . Instead my preoccupation has become with DT success of DT trials . I used not to care whether Imperial or Oxford got RB first but every piece of good NN about “ my ” NN has made me VB to cheer and blow an Oxford University vuvuzela out DT window . Then when PRP was reported IN DT vaccinated monkeys all ended up contracting NN , I was bereft . Thankfully I will not ( intentionally ) be made to face DT NN in DT same way but I VBP to tell my grandchildren I tested DT NN WDT saved humanity , not CD of DT forgotten scores WDT did n’t work . Looking back , I can see I ’d incorrectly seen myself as DT protagonist who had to have DT best story , DT most dramatic side effects . Eventually , I came to appreciate EX will be JJ trials and thousands more volunteers on DT Oxford trial alone . Next week I ’ll be back in hospital for follow - up tests just as DT latest volunteers arrive for their first shots . Failure and learning are central to DT NNS eventually succeeding so even if my NN does n’t work , I wo n’t ever regret having been CD of DT first to add my name to DT list . To sign up to participate in a NN trial , PRP can register your interest online ."

PRP ’re not totally off base with your question — if PRP got yours several months ago , PRP ’s reasonable to VB its effectiveness has worn off . Assuming PRP ’re older than 8 NNS old , PRP turns out PRP do n’t need a second NN shot this NN season . A second dose is recommended only for kids ages 6 months through 8 NNS who have never been vaccinated before or only had CD shot in DT past , explains Elizabeth Barnett , MD , professor of pediatrics at Boston University School of Medicine . “ Because of DT immaturity of [ their ] immune system , PRP do not respond well to a single dose of NN NN , ” she says . “ Though a single dose will not result in a good immune response , PRP primes DT immune system to respond to a second dose , which then results in a good immune response . ” Adults and older NNS , on DT other hand , are already primed , thanks to their previous vaccinations . “ Currently , EX are no recommendations for any other age group to receive more than CD NN NN in a season , ” says Dr. Barnett , who is RB a spokesperson for DT American Academy of Pediatrics . Adults who have never had a NN shot until this season RB wo n’t benefit from a second NN in DT same NN . Kids who do meet DT criteria for a second NN shot should VB their first dose as soon as PRP ’s available . DT second dose should be administered at least four weeks later , according to DT CDC . EX is some preliminary evidence IN DT effectiveness of DT NN NN MD wane over DT course of a NN season , Dr. Barnett adds , but “ at this NN , this information does not represent a rigorous NN of DT phenomenon , ” she says , and DT research certainly is n’t strong enough to warrant getting another shot .

""_'' See_VB also_RB my_PRP$ ""_`` Winston_NNP Churchill_NNP Illuminati_NNP ""_''","Since writing this in 2004 , I have come to DT conclusion IN PRP was common knowledge : DT Rothschilds ran both Britain and USSR and EX is no way England MD allow Germany His real mission was to lead Germany Hitler did n't VB a NN war , and had no stomach for fighting England , according to Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist Louis Kilzer , author of Churchill 's Deception ( Simon & Schuster , 1994 ) . Hitler believed DT future of Western civilization depended on DT cooperation of Germany and her Aryan cousins : England and DT NNP NNPS . His territorial demands were limited to Communist Russia , which he regarded as a proxy for Jewish NN ambitions . He was determined to avoid fighting a war on two fronts . DT "" miracle at Dunkirk "" was an extraordinary peace overture to England . PRP do n't normally associate Hitler with such magnanimity . In NNP 1940 , DT British were on DT verge of defeat . DT English army was trapped at Dunkirk . Rather than take them prisoner , Hitler halted his generals for three days allowing 330,000 men to escape . "" DT blood of every single Englishman is too valuable to shed , "" Hitler VBD . "" Our two NNS belong together racially and traditionally . DT is and always has been my aim , even if our generals can't grasp PRP . "" ( Kilzer , p.213 ) This is not an attempt to exonerate Hitler . His ideology of Aryan racial supremacy and his enslavement / extermination of "" inferior races "" ( mainly Jews and Slavs ) are abhorrent to me . ( Do I need to say this ? ) My own grandparents were murdered by DT Nazis . I believe NNS can take pride in their race or nationality without seeking to dominate others . Nonetheless , PRP should understand IN our view of Hitler is influenced by propaganda . DT Allies were RB guilty of atrocities and war crimes . Furthermore , Hitler was created , manipulated and destroyed by DT same Illuminist clique WDT runs DT NN today . According to Kilzer 's well - documented book , Hitler was trying to convince DT English to make peace . In exchange , he was ready to retreat from Western Europe and from much of Poland . Kilzer describes how British Intelligence ( an arm of DT Illuminati ) took advantage of Hitler 's racist ideology to divert his energies against Russia and trap him in a two - front war . PRP convinced him IN a large pro Nazi ( anti Communist ) "" Peace Party "" was prepared to unseat DT "" warmonger "" Churchill . This party consisted of DT Duke of Windsor ( DT former King Edward VIII ) and appeasement - minded elitists known as DT "" Cliveden Set . "" DT Nazis had longstanding social ties with this group and confided in them . Hitler seemed to overlook DT fact IN Windsor went to stay at DT Rothschild castle in Austria after he abdicated . Rudolph Hess , DT Deputy Leader of Nazi Germany , was in contact with DT Cliveden group and flew to England NNP 10 , 1941 to negotiate peace . According to Kilzer , Hess had Hitler 's blessings . Coincidentally this was DT worst night of DT Blitz . Afterwards , EX was a long lull in both Nazi and British bombing raids . PRP appears DT Nazis thought PRP had an understanding with DT British and turned their attention to DT invasion of Russia DT following month ( June 22 , 1941 . ) Hitler did n't understand IN DT Anglo American elite was ( and still is ) intimately connected with international ( i.e. Rothschild ) finance . Anglo American imperialism is , in fact , a front for DT families WDT own DT Bank of England and DT Federal Reserve . These Jewish and non-Jewish families are connected by money , marriage and Lucifer worship ( i.e. Freemasonry ) . Both Roosevelt and Churchill were their flunkies . ( All our "" leaders "" are . ) In 1776 Meyer Rothschild financed DT Illuminati , a Masonic secret society WDT in turn spawned DT major revolutions of DT modern era including DT Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 . DT ultimate aim is to establish DT banker NN dictatorship , which is at an advanced stage today . In DT 1930s their purpose was to incite a two - front war WDT MD leave DT great nation NNS ( England , Germany and Russia ) prostrate . IN all wars , DT purpose was to kill millions of NNS , traumatize humanity , increase JJ debt and private profit , and make "" NN NN "" ( DT future UN ) seem essential for "" peace . "" DT 1930's British Policy of Appeasement was probably designed to encourage Hitler 's expansionist tendencies and to provoke war . Douglas Reed , DT ( London ) Times Correspondent in Berlin , was first tipped off to something fishy when his newspaper suppressed his warnings of DT Hitler menace . ( See his Controversy of Zion ) Why MD DT financial elite RB VB to destroy Russia , which PRP created ? DT transcript of DT 1938 NKVD interrogation of C.G. Rakowsky ( a.k.a Chaim Rakeover ) provides DT answer . Rakowsky was an intimate of Trotsky 's and former Soviet ambassador to Paris . Rothschild 's agent Leon Trotsky was supposed to succeed Lenin but got sick at DT critical moment . Stalin was able to assume power and divert Russia from Rothschild control . In order to control Stalin , international finance was forced to build up Hitler and DT Nazi party . Rakowsky confirms IN Jewish financiers backed DT Nazis although Hitler was not aware of this . "" DT ambassador Warburg presented himself under a false name and Hitler did not even guess his race ... he RB lied regarding whose representative he was ... Our aim was to provoke a war and Hitler was war ...[ DT Nazis ] received ... millions of dollars sent to PRP from Wall Street , and millions of Marks from German financiers through Schacht ; [ providing ] DT upkeep of DT S.A and DT S.S. and RB DT financing of DT elections ... "" Unfortunately for DT bankers , Hitler RB proved intractable . He started to print his own money ! "" He took over for himself DT privilege of manufacturing money and not only physical moneys , but RB financial ones ; he took over DT untouched machinery of falsification and put PRP to work for DT benefit of DT NN ... Are PRP capable of imagining what MD have come ... if PRP had infected a number of other NNS and brought about DT creation of a period of autarchy [ absolute rule , replacing DT of DT bankers ] . If PRP can , then imagine its counterrevolutionary functions ... "" Hitler had become a bigger threat than Stalin , who had not meddled with money . DT British were not VBG to make peace with Hitler because he had stopped DT banker 's racket . Furthermore , DT Illuminati wanted an extended war , DT ruin of Europe and DT expansion of DT USSR . DT book "" Financial Origins of National Socialism "" ( 1933 ) by "" Sydney Warburg "" provides another glimpse of how DT Illuminist clique supported Hitler . This 70 - page booklet was suppressed for JJ NNS but was republished in 1983 as "" Hitler 's Secret Backers . "" "" Warburg "" describes a July 1929 meeting with "" Carter , "" DT NNP of J.P. Morgan 's Guarantee Trust , DT Presidents of DT Federal Reserve Banks , "" DT young Rockefeller "" and "" Glean from Royal Dutch . "" These are all Rothschild dominated . PRP was determined IN Warburg who spoke German should travel to Germany and ask Hitler how much money he needed to overthrow DT NN . DT only stipulation was IN Hitler adopts "" an aggressive foreign policy . "" "" Warburg "" details five meetings with Hitler between 1929 and 1933 . DT first took place in a beer cellar and Hitler calculated his needs on DT back of a paper plate . About $ 25 million was transferred . This was extremely important in DT depth of DT depression because DT Nazis provided food and shelter to JJ of their supporters . Hitler was n't told DT reason for this support and did not ask . On two occasions , he wondered out loud if "" Warburg "" was himself Jewish but dismissed DT idea before "" Warburg "" MD reply . EX is no "" Sydney Warburg "" but DT internal evidence suggests DT author MD be James P. Warburg , son of Federal Reserve founder Paul Warburg . General Ludendorff's wife testified at DT Nuremburg trials IN James P. Warburg was DT conduit through which eventually $ 34 million was transferred from Wall Street to DT Nazis . PRP wonders why anyone MD VB to this much trouble to alienate DT most powerful NNS in DT NN if he were n't sincere . DT only NNS with DT power to suppress PRP are DT ones PRP incriminates , and PRP have a record of suppressing similar works . See RB Antony Sutton 's Discussion of this book . "" Who controls DT past controls DT future : who controls DT present controls DT past . "" George Orwell DT winners write history . Our view of Hitler and DT Second NNP War is largely a Jewish view . Paradoxically Hitler was created and manipulated by DT bankers he railed against . He lost DT war because he did n't appreciate their larger agenda . He naively failed to recognize IN PRP controlled England and DT NNP NNPS . PRP 's as if he did n't believe his own propaganda . Blinded by racist zeal , he made a fatal blunder ( from his point of view ) of not neutralizing England by seizing DT Middle Eastern oilfields . He made another fatal error by not promising to liberate DT Russian NNS from oppression . Nazi brutality turned DT Slavs into implacable fighters . But for his demented racist ideology and consequent barbarism , Hitler might have done some good . JJ Germans and even some German Jews supported him . Instead , he was another pawn in DT Illuminati 's diabolical game . --- See RB my "" Was Hitler a ' British ' Agent ? "" See RB my "" Winston Churchill Illuminati """

Andrew Cuomo , DT governor of NNP York , is delivering DT last of his daily briefings , which have been watched avidly from Bensonhurst to Buffalo , and well beyond . Back in early April , when DT Empire NNP was recording more than ten thousand JJ NN NNS each day , and nearly eight hundred deaths on some days , DT sight of a socially distanced Cuomo VBG calmly through DT latest figures , and explaining DT situation regarding masks , gowns , and ventilators , presented a ghastly spectacle , but RB a reassuring NN . With DT country effectively leaderless , EX was at least CD responsible adult in a position of authority — or so PRP told ourselves as PRP hunkered down in our apartments and listened to DT ambulances racing by . During DT past couple of months , NNP York ’s case figures have fallen precipitously . On Thursday , DT NN reported six hundred and eighteen JJ infections , and just thirty - two deaths . Most of NNP York is now well into DT reopening process , and NNP York City will take another significant step next week , Mayor Bill de Blasio confirmed on Thursday , allowing JJ offices , retail stores , barbershops , and playgrounds to reopen . From this point on , Cuomo will deliver his NN - CD briefings as needed , he has indicated . NNP York ’s comeback is a testimony to DT heroic efforts of NN professionals , E.M.T. employees , transit workers , delivery - truck drivers , and equally essential workers in supermarkets , warehouses , and other places — JJ of them poorly paid — who kept DT stricken city and NN VBG through its darkest days and nights . Cuomo and de Blasio , after some critical early missteps , RB deserve credit for sticking at PRP , as do ordinary NNP Yorkers who obeyed DT stay - at - home orders and wore masks when PRP became available . DT key point is IN PRP took a monumental and community - wide effort to limit DT official death toll to fewer than twenty - five thousand statewide . ( Based on DT number of “ excess deaths ” this NN , DT actual figure is probably considerably higher . ) DT experiences of NNP Jersey and Massachusetts were similar . Now , as case counts rise alarmingly in other parts of DT country , EX is every reason to suppose IN these places will need similarly comprehensive efforts to prevent a disaster from occurring . At DT moment , though , particularly in parts of red America , a combination of poor leadership , JJ exhaustion , and right - wing politics is greatly hampering an effective response . Take Arizona , Florida , and Texas , three Republican - run NNS WDT began reopening their economies in early NNP . In all three NNS , DT number of confirmed JJ NNS has spiked over DT past couple of weeks . On Thursday , Arizona reported 2,519 JJ infections and Florida reported 3,209 , both of which were record highs . On Tuesday and Wednesday , Texas reported almost eight thousand JJ NNS , which is by far its biggest two - day count yet . These numbers are still relatively small compared to what was experienced in DT Northeast , but DT nature of a pandemic is IN when PRP gets VBG PRP can spread very rapidly , and EX are other worrying signs IN this MD be starting to happen . In all three NNS , DT percentage of tests returning positive results has increased , which means DT rise is n’t simply an artifact of more testing . In Arizona , DT rate of positive tests was five per cent on NNP 10th , and PRP ’s now 9.1 per cent , according to reporting on Thursday from KTAR , a Phoenix NN station . In Florida , DT positive rate was below five per cent a month ago , and PRP ’s now 7.4 per cent , according to DT NN database WDT Johns Hopkins University maintains . DT number of hospitalizations has RB risen sharply . In Arizona on Wednesday , 3,861 NNS had been hospitalized for NN - CD , compared to 1,699 a month ago , according to figures from DT NNP Tracking Project — a rise of about a hundred and thirty per cent . A former director of DT NN ’s NN department has warned IN emergency field hospitals MD be needed by July 4th . In Texas , NN authorities reported on Thursday IN EX are 2,947 NNS with NN - CD in hospitals , which represents a doubling since Memorial Day . In Florida , 12,673 NNS have been hospitalized , compared with a cumulative total of 8,553 a month ago , according to DT NNP Tracking Project . As yet , DT number of deaths has n’t risen as sharply as hospitalizations . DT MD well VB in DT coming weeks . With DT NN spreading , bitter disputes have arisen between DT NNS ’ Republican governors — Doug Ducey , in Arizona ; Ron DeSantis , in Florida ; and Greg Abbott , in Texas — and local leaders in DT hardest - hit areas , who are calling for mandatory mask - wearing , more NN resources , and an expansion of contact tracing . Despite having had months to prepare for a possible surge in infections , all three NNS have fallen woefully short in all of these areas . DT dispute over DT use of masks is particularly tragic , since PRP is by far DT easiest and cheapest way to check rapid spread of DT NN . Pressured by conservative activists and demonstrators , who in turn have been inspired by NNP NNP ’s chronic irresponsibility on this matter , Ducey , DeSantis , and Abbott have refused to issue statewide orders mandating wearing masks in NN . Finally , in DT past couple of days , two of them — Ducey , in Arizona , and Abbott , in Texas — have shifted ground , but DT manner in which PRP moved demonstrated DT damaging politics at play . On Wednesday , Abbott VBD IN , while he was sticking to his refusal to act at DT NN level , he MD support local authorities and businesses WDT require employees and customers to wear masks . “ PRP VBP to make sure IN individual liberty is not infringed upon by NN and , hence , NN cannot require individuals to wear a mask , ” told a Waco television station . “ However , pursuant to my plan , local governments can require stores and businesses to require masks . ” DT same day , Ducey belatedly acknowledged reality , noting , “ EX is a trend , and DT trend is headed in DT wrong direction . ” He RB dropped his opposition to cities in Arizona , such as Tucson and Flagstaff , mandating DT wearing of masks in NN , but he again refused to issue a statewide order , saying PRP MD n’t work , and adding , “ I VBP some NNS view this as an issue of personal freedom . ” PRP has long been a basic principle of democratic governance WDT where JJ NN comes into conflict with individual freedoms , DT latter MD have to be constricted , at least temporarily . But with NNP in DT White House and elected Republicans terrified of incurring his supporters ’ wrath , EX is now , in parts of red America , nobody willing to make this argument or to follow through with actual edicts . Local leaders and their constituents are left to fend for themselves . Indeed , DeSantis , in Florida , VBD this openly on Wednesday , when , after insisting IN he MD n’t suspend any of his reopening measures , he added IN residents of DT NN should “ make wise decisions for themselves based upon their own personal risk . ”"

Childhood NNS protect NNS from a variety of serious or potentially fatal diseases , including diphtheria , measles , mumps , rubella , polio , tetanus , whooping cough ( pertussis ) and others . If these diseases seem uncommon — or even unheard of — PRP 's usually because these NNS are doing their job . Still , PRP might wonder about DT benefits and risks of childhood NNS . Here are straight answers to common questions about childhood NNS . Is natural immunity better than NN ? A natural infection might provide better immunity than NN — but EX are serious risks . For example , a natural chickenpox ( varicella ) infection MD lead to pneumonia . A natural polio infection MD cause permanent paralysis . A natural mumps infection MD lead to deafness . A natural Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) infection MD result in permanent brain damage or even death . NN can help prevent these diseases and their potentially serious complications . NNS do not cause NN . Despite much controversy on DT topic , researchers have n't found a connection between NN and childhood NNS . In fact , DT original NN WDT ignited DT debate NNS ago has been retracted . Any NN can cause side effects . Usually , these side effects are minor — a low - grade fever , fussiness and soreness at DT injection site . Some NNS cause a temporary headache , fatigue or loss of appetite . Rarely , a child might experience a severe allergic reaction or a neurological side effect , such as a seizure . Although these rare side effects are a concern , DT risk of a NN causing serious harm or death is extremely small . DT benefits of getting a NN are much greater than DT possible side effects for almost all NNS . Of course , NNS are n't given to NNS who have known allergies to specific NN components . Likewise , if your child develops a life - threatening reaction to a particular NN , further doses of DT NN wo n't be given . Why are NNS given so early ? DT diseases WDT childhood NNS are meant to prevent are most likely to occur when a child is very young and DT risk of complications is greatest . DT makes early NN — sometimes beginning shortly after birth — essential . If PRP postpone NNS until a child is older , PRP might be too late . Is PRP OK to pick and choose NNS ? In general , skipping NNS is n't a good idea . This can leave your child vulnerable to potentially serious diseases WDT MD otherwise be avoided . And consider this : For some NNS — including those who can't receive certain NNS for JJ reasons ( such as cancer therapy ) — DT only protection from NN - preventable diseases is DT immunity of DT NNS around them . If immunization rates drop , NN - preventable diseases might once again become common threats . If PRP have reservations about particular NNS , discuss your concerns with your child 's doctor . If your child falls behind DT standard NNS schedule , ask DT doctor about catch - up immunizations . Mayo Clinic Minute : Why and when NNS should be vaccinated for video Mayo Clinic Minute : Why and when NNS should be vaccinated Elizabeth Cozine , M.D. : NN prevents a child from getting an illness . PRP RB prevents them from spreading an illness . Jason Howland : Dr. Elizabeth Cozine , a Mayo Clinic family physician , says DT Centers for NNP Control and Prevention has a standard immunization schedule for school - age NNS WDT begins with ages 4 to 6 . Dr. Cozine : … which PRP VBP of as kindergarten shots . So DT 's measles , mumps , rubella and varicella . Jason Howland : She says DT next set of routine immunizations is at age 11 … Dr. Cozine : … which is tetanus , diphtheria and pertussis , and DT meningococcal immunization . Jason Howland : PRP 's RB recommended every child VB an annual NN shot . And HPV NN , which prevents cancer , can start as early as age 9 . Dr. Cozine says PRP 's important to educate families on DT importance of childhood vaccinations . She likens PRP to seat belt safety . Dr. Cozine : Immunizations are no different . If PRP have opportunities to protect our NNS against serious illness and potentially even death , even if DT risk of DT illness or DT risk of death from DT illness is really quite low , I 'm all for PRP ."

Farben , BASF , Hoechst , Dow and Bayer , who created DT gas chambers and tested dangerous NNS on innocent Jews , did n’t just VB away . In fact , PRP went to work for U.S. corporations and pharmaceutical companies WDT run DT NN industry today . At least a dozen of these cold blooded killers were hired fresh out of prison , just 4 to 7 NNS after DT Nuremberg trials found them guilty of mass murder and enslavement . In fact , at DT close of WWII , DT IG Farben building in Frankfort was protected from allied bombings by DT highest levels of military command . Why ? IG Farben was DT FDA / CDC type of “ pharmaceutical arm ” of Hitler ’s 4th Reich , and DT Rockefellers had a financial interest in maintaining and controlling this pharmaceutical empire , which MD soon be catapulted on U.S. soil . Research reveals IN Hitler RB invested heavily in Merck and other pharmaceutical companies . Nazi convicted mass murderers became executives for major U.S. chemical and pharmaceutical companies Fritz ter Meer , found guilty of slavery and mass murder at Auschwitz , served only seven NNS in prison and became Chairman of DT Board at Bayer in 1956 . Still trust U.S. NNS ? This is DT same NN industry today which protected and employed Nazi war criminals . DT very industry WDT produced DT Nazi gas chambers was purchased by Bayer . So , exactly whom are PRP trusting with your NNS ’s NN and welfare ? Currently , DT U.S. NNP and DT CDC rely solely on DT manufacturers of NNS to report problems , injuries and deaths . This atrocity is IN letting murderers be their own judges in court ! Where are DT checks and balances this country was founded upon ? NNS have JJ and political agendas now , and DT FDA does absolutely no testing of their own before making decisions to release NNS to DT masses . VB more research before PRP or your child VB injected with a JJ concocted NN for which EX is no cure ? Listen to stunning admissions by NN industry experts , including Dr. Maurice Hilleman ( formerly w / Merck ) , who admitted to DT deadly nature of DT most trusted NNS . Today ’s NNS not only contain live versions of DT diseases PRP DO NOT VB , but RB contain GMOs , hormones from infected cows , pigs , chickens and monkeys , untested NN combinations ( IN H1N1 ) , aluminum , mercury , emulsifiers , and crossbred bacteria from animals , mosquitoes , and diseased humans : Measles Live NN NN : ( Attenuvax ) Made by Merck . Two injections are given ; CD at 1 NN and another at 4 NNS old . Contains gelatin , sorbitol , sodium chloride , bovine cow serum , egg protein and human albumin . Measles and Mumps Live NN NN : ( M - M - Rvax ) Made by Merck . Injected into CD NN old babies . Contains gelatin , sorbitol , sodium chloride , bovine cow serum , and human albumin . Diptheria , Tetanus and Polio NNP : Five injections given between 2 and 6 NNS of age , plus boosters “ recommended ” every 10 NNS . Contains formaldehyde , phenoxyethanol and aluminum phosphate . DTaP , IPV , HBV and Hib* : ( Diphtheria , tetanus , polio , hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenza type B ) Given to infants 2 to 12 months with boosters less than a NN later . Contains aluminum hydroxide , formaldehyde , and bovine cow serum . Gardasil HPV : Human Papillomavirus NN Made by Merck . “ Recommended ” 3 intramuscular injections ; given at birth , 2 and 6 months of age . Re-administered to NNS as young as 9 NNS of age for a rare sexually transmitted NN . Contains polysorbate 80 , sodium chloride , aluminum , and a “ denatured ” ( fragmented and weakened ) form of DT NN . • Bovine cow serum : Extracted from cow skin . When injected causes connective tissue disorders , arthritis and lupus ; RB shortness of breath , low blood pressure , chest pain and skin reactions . • Sorbitol : Synthetic sweetener which metabolizes very slowly and aggravates IBS and gastrointestinal issues . • Gelatin : Derived from DT collagen inside animals ’ skin and bones . Injecting gelatin poses DT risk of infection from synthetic growth hormones and BSE infectivity ( mad cow NN ) . • Egg protein : NNS are prepared in eggs ( certainly not organic ) . MD contain growth hormones , antibiotics , and salmonella bacteria . • Thimerosal : A neurotoxic mercury which causes NN : EX are 25 mcg in CD average NN NN , and DT EPA safety limit is 5 micrograms , so NNS who are vaccinated simultaneously with multiple * NNS receive over 10 times DT safety limit of mercury in CD day . • Human albumin : DT protein portion of blood frompooled human venous plasma ; when injected causes fever , chills , hives , rash , headache , nausea , breathing difficulty , and rapid heart rate . Injecting “ pooled blood ” can result in a loss of body cell mass and cause immunodeficiency NN infection , or contain SV40 , AIDS , cancer or Hepatitis B from drug addicts . • Formaldehyde : Highly carcinogenic fluid used to embalm corpses . Ranked CD of DT most hazardous compounds to human NN ; can cause liver damage , gastrointestinal issues , reproductive deformation , respiratory distress and cancer . Plus , formaldehyde has been known to fail todeactivate DT virusthe NN is intended to cure , thus enabling a live NN to enter your blood and infect your system . • Phenoxyethanol : A glycol ether / chemical ; highly toxic to DT nervous system , kidneys , and liver . DT FDA warns “ can cause shut down of DT central nervous system ( CNS ) , vomiting and contact dermatitis ” in cosmetics ; imagine when injected into your blood . • Aluminum phosphate : Greatly increases toxicity of mercury , so caution aboutminimum mercury toleranceis therefore severely underestimated . CDC NNS and all doctors are well aware of this . • MSG ( monosodium glutamate ) : When injected becomes a neurotoxin , causing CNS disorders and brain damage in NNS . If PRP especially enjoy being lied to , visit vaccinateyourbaby.org , where PRP tell PRP formaldehyde is safe because PRP is “ present in DT environment and is a byproduct of metabolism , so PRP is already present in DT human body . ” PRP RB inform PRP IN aluminum is good for PRP , because “ [ a ] luminum is RB commonly found in food , NN , infant formula and even breast milk . ” Hey , if PRP ’s in DT environment , PRP must be safe to inject into your veins ( so why not use snake venom , bleach , and plutonium ? ) .

Willcocks et al. investigated immune responses to influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations in 9 hepatic and 23 renal transplant recipients who had been randomized to either continue on a calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ; tacrolimus or ciclosporin ; n = 17 ) or switch to sirolimus ( n = 15 ) at least 3 months after transplantation . All patients received — from DT same batches — an influenza NN and , 4 weeks later , a pneumococcal NN . Four weeks after influenza NN , mean titers of antibodies against all three influenza antigens tested had increased significantly in both patient groups ( P < 0.0005 ) and EX were no significant differences in increases between groups .

When a NN proves effective , EX ’s a good chance PRP will entail a two - dose series , USA Today reported . Shots MD need to be administered CD month apart , with a booster following several NNS later . As of June 2 , DT NNP NNP Organization ( WHO ) listed 10 NN candidates under clinical evaluation , with 123 candidates in preclinical evaluation . Barry Bloom , immunologist and professor of JJ NN at DT Harvard T.H. Chan School of NNP NNP in Boston , told USA Today IN almost all of DT NN developers are considering two shots in their regimens . According to DT outlet ’s report , DT first shot in DT series MD “ prime DT immune system ” to help DT body recognize DT NN , followed by a second shot to “ strengthen DT immune response . ” When NN candidates reach human clinical trials , more precise dosing will become clear , Dr. Kelly Moore , associate director of immunization education for DT Immunization Action Coalition , told DT outlet . After DT first dose of a NN , DT immune system develops antibodies and immune cells in about 14 days , says L.J.

Tan estimated any NN - CD NN requiring two doses MD likely be administered about a month or two apart . NN HAS NOT RESURGED IN OREGON FOLLOWING REOPENINGS , NN NN OFFICIAL SAYS In addition , WHO officials VBD DT NN is n’t mutating to become more dangerous during a briefing on Wednesday . Since DT SARS - CoV - 2 is seemingly stable so far , initial NNS MD act as boosters later on to extend immunity , Bloom told DT outlet . However , NNS are n’t sure how durable NNS ’s immune response will be . For coronaviruses causing DT common cold , Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of DT National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , VBD immunity almost always lasts less than a NN . "" PRP MD be completely different with this NN , with SARS - CoV - 2 , PRP MD be IN PRP induce a response WDT ’s quite durable , "" Fauci told DT editor of DT Journal of DT American NNP Association .

Senior Catholic leaders in DT NNP NNPS and Canada , along with other antiabortion groups , are raising ethical objections to promising NN - CD NN candidates WDT are manufactured using cells derived from human fetuses electively aborted decades ago . PRP have not sought to block NN funding for DT NNS , which include two candidate NNS WDT DT NNP administration plans to support with an investment of up to $ 1.7 billion , as well as a third candidate made by a Chinese company in collaboration with Canada ’s National Research Council ( NRC ) . But PRP are urging funders and policymakers to ensure IN companies develop other NNS WDT do not rely on such human fetal cell lines and , in DT NNP NNPS , asking DT NN to “ incentivize ” firms to only make NNS WDT do n’t rely on fetal cells . “ PRP is critically important IN Americans have access to a NN WDT is produced ethically : no American should be forced to choose between being vaccinated against this potentially deadly NN and violating his or her conscience , ” members of DT U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and 20 other religious , JJ , and political organizations WDT oppose abortion wrote to Stephen Hahn , commissioner of DT U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , in April . “ Thankfully , other [ NNP - CD ] NNS … utilize cell lines not connected to unethical procedures and methods . ” “ PRP urge your NN to fund DT development of NNS WDT do not create an ethical dilemma for JJ Canadians , ” wrote Archbishop of Winnipeg Richard Gagnon , NN of DT Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops , and 17 other antiabortion religious , JJ , and politic groups and individuals in a 21 NNP letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau . “ DT … manufacture of NNS using such ethically - tainted human cell lines demonstrates profound disrespect for DT dignity of DT human person . ” FDA and senior White House officials did not respond to emails requesting comment on DT letter to Hahn . In Canada , DT NN ministry has promised to respond to DT letter to Trudeau , says Moira McQueen , executive director of DT Canadian Catholic Bioethics Institute and lead signatory on DT letter . Cells derived from elective abortions have been used since DT 1960s to manufacture NNS , including current NNS against rubella , chickenpox , hepatitis A , and shingles . PRP have RB been used to make approved drugs against diseases including hemophilia , rheumatoid arthritis , and cystic fibrosis . Now , research groups around DT NN are working to develop more than 130 candidate NNS against NNP - CD , according to DT NNP NNP Organization ; 10 had entered human trials as of 2 June . At least five of DT candidate NNP - CD NNS use CD of two human fetal cell lines : HEK - 293 , a kidney cell line widely used in research and industry WDT comes from a fetus aborted in about 1972 ; and PER . C6 , a proprietary cell line owned by Janssen , a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson , developed from retinal cells from an 18 - week - old fetus aborted in 1985 . Both cell lines were developed in DT lab of molecular biologist Alex van der Eb at Leiden University . Two of DT five NNS have entered human trials ( see table , below ) . In four of DT NNS , DT human fetal cells are used as miniature “ factories ” to generate vast quantities of adenoviruses , disabled so IN PRP cannot replicate , WDT are used as vehicles to ferry genes from DT novel NN WDT causes NN - CD . When DT adenoviruses are given as a NN , recipients ’ cells begin to produce proteins from DT NN , hopefully triggering a protective immune response . DT fifth NN , which has shown promise in monkeys and is headed for human trials as soon as this summer , is what is known as a protein subunit NN . Researchers at DT University of Pittsburgh use HEK - 293 cells to manufacture DT NN ’ spike protein — a vital part of its structure — which is used to trigger an immune response . DT NN is delivered through a skin patch with 400 tiny needles . DT fetal cell lines are key to producing both types of NN . “ HEK - 293 [ cells ] are essential for making protein subunit NNS , ” says Andrea Gambotto , a NN scientist at DT University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and DT NN ’s lead developer . Their human origin is important , he says : “ Cultured [ nonhuman ] animal cells can produce DT same proteins , but PRP MD be decorated with different sugar molecules , which — in DT case of NNS — runs DT risk of failing to evoke a robust and specific immune response . ” ( Among DT developers of DT five NNS , only Gambotto responded to a request for comment . ) David Prentice , vice NN and research director at DT Charlotte Lozier Institute , which opposes abortion , notes researchers making adenovirus NNS have modified HEK - 293 cells to be adept at packaging JJ genes — such as those WDT direct cells to assemble DT NN spike protein — into adenoviruses . But he adds IN other technologies are available , including using cells captured from amniocentesis WDT are engineered to make replication - deficient adenoviruses . “ DT use of cells from electively aborted fetuses for NN production makes these five NN - CD NN programs unethical , because PRP exploit DT innocent human beings who were aborted , ” Prentice and a co-author — molecular biologist James Sherley , a Lozier Institute associate scholar and director of DT adult stem cell company Asymmetrex — wrote in a position paper published last month . But Arthur Caplan , a bioethicist at DT NNP York University School of Medicine , counters : “ EX are better ways to win DT abortion wars than telling NNS not to use a NN . These are long - over abortions . These cells are decades old , and even major religious leaders IN DT pope have acknowledged IN for DT greater good PRP ’s not worth DT symbolism to put DT community at risk . ” DT Vatican ’s Pontifical Academy for Life declared in 2005 and reaffirmed in 2017 IN in DT absence of alternatives , Catholics MD , in good conscience , receive NNS made using historical human fetal cell lines . A NN made by DT Chinese company CanSino Biologics was DT first NNP - CD NN to enter phase II human trials . PRP was developed using adapted HEK - 293 cells WDT DT company licensed from Canada ’s NRC , where DT cells were developed . ( NRC - developed HEK - 293 cells have already been used to develop an approved Ebola NN . ) Last month , NRC announced a collaboration with CanSino Biologics under which PRP is preparing to run late - stage clinical trials of DT NN in Canada , and scale up facilities to produce DT NN in quantity . DT two U.S. - backed NNS WDT have drawn criticism from antiabortion groups are on a short list of candidates targeted to VB financial and logistical support from DT U.S. NN under DT White House ’s Operation Warp Speed , which aims to accelerate DT development and approval of at least CD NN - CD NN by January 2021 , according to a 3 June report in . CD of DT Warp Speed candidates , made by Janssen Research & Development , uses PER . C6 cells . DT second , from University of Oxford researchers and AstraZeneca , uses HEK - 293 cells . Both have received U.S. NN commitments of , respectively , $ 456 million and $ 1.2 billion , if PRP meet milestones , through DT Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority ( BARDA ) . Another NN WDT relies on HEK - 293 , being developed by two companies owned by DT billionaire scientist and businessman Patrick Soon - Shiong , made an earlier , Warp Speed long list of 14 promising candidates , according to a press release from CD of companies , NantKwest . Prentice says : “ As PRP are choosing — BARDA and DT Warp Speed NNS — what NNS to move ahead , PRP should at least recognize IN EX is some portion of DT population who MD VB an alternative NN PRP can take in good conscience . ” Caplan disagrees . “ If PRP are VBG to say DT NN should n’t fund things WDT a minority of NNS object to , PRP will have a very long list of things WDT wo n’t VB funded by DT NN , from research on weapons of war to contraceptive research . ” DT NNP administration has restricted DT use of human fetal tissue from elective abortions in biomedical research . CD NN ago , PRP adopted a policy WDT forbids researchers at DT National Institutes of NNP ( NIH ) from using fetal tissue from elective abortions in their studies . And PRP imposed an extra layer of review on non-NIH NNS seeking agency funding to do research using such tissue . But DT policy did not stop either group from using decades - old fetal cell lines IN HEK - 293 and PER .C6 . * Clarification , 8 June , 12:10 p.m. : This story has been updated to clarify IN DT Vatican approves of Catholics receiving NNS manufactured using human fetal cells only in DT absence of alternatives ."

EX ’s no easy way to develop a NN . Each experimental candidate has about a six percent chance of making PRP to market , about half DT estimate for traditional drugs . Developing NNS is getting more complex and costs are VBG up . “ NN development is facing a crisis , ” according to Stanley Plotkin , a scientist pivotal in developing DT rubella jab in DT 1960s and who now advises Sanofi Pasteur MSD , writing in a NNP England Journal of Medicine comment . DT culprits are JJ : more stringent clinical trial and manufacturing rules introduced over DT last decade , costly production , DT “ lowest hanging fruit ” already developed and a difficult business model , which some VBP so far as to call dysfunctional . Amid these trends , demand is rising . Even at a record pace for industry , several NNS to protect against DT Ebola NN WDT killed more than 11,000 NNS last NN have been tested , but EX is still no licensed product . Demand for NNS for Lyme NN , tuberculosis , and JJ more infectious diseases are RB needed , according to DT JJ NN experts . And EX are spot shortages even in developed NNS . For example , a shortage of tuberculosis NNS in France prompted Sanofi Pasteur MSD to hand out shots initially meant for Poland last month . So far , a concerted JJ effort eradicated CD NN with NN — smallpox in DT 1980s — showing what is possible with broad coordination . A major hurdle DT industry faces is meeting DT fragmented demand across Europe ’s markets , according to Andrea Rappagliosi , NN of NNPS Europe , an industry group . Immunization schedules vary by country , requiring different doses and frequency of jabs . “ This does n’t ease access to a complex product , ” which takes up to two NNS to develop once an order is placed , VBD Rappagliosi , who RB sits on DT executive committee of DT Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture . NNS are made using DT NN - causing NN or bacteria , but in a form WDT is essentially harmless , either by weakening PRP , killing PRP , or extracting part of DT NN or bacteria . This prompts DT immune system to develop antibodies against DT NN . Given DT complexity in development and DT high risks involved , DT rewards need to be sizeable to attract investors . DT industry says PRP costs between $ 200 and $ 900 million to develop a NN , with an estimated 70 percent of DT dedicated to quality control , according to DT International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations . But some are skeptical IN development costs are DT biggest hindrance to better and faster NNS . Where DT money goes Just a handful of companies — GlaxoSmithKline , Pfizer , Merck and Sanofi Pasteur MSD — control DT majority of DT market , which inflates prices , critics say . “ DT [ research and development ] model is broken , ” VBD Kate Elder , NNS policy adviser at Médecins Sans Frontieres . “ Priorities are chosen based on where DT money is … diseases predominantly in DT developed NN , ” she VBD . MSF , which buys drugs in bulk for their work in developing NNS , says IN although DT number of diseases against which NNS are advised to be vaccinated has doubled since 2000 , DT cost of DT NN package has multiplied 68 - fold . Companies employ “ tiered pricing ” dependent upon a country ’s relative wealth and need . Low - income NNS qualify for NNS via GAVI , a JJ - private partnership WDT strikes voluntary pricing deals with pharma ; however middle - income NNS do not , meaning access can be worse than in poorer NNS . And groups IN MSF say PRP is impossible to tell how much PRP costs to develop a NN because companies are not completely transparent about R&D spending . GSK says its NN prices have increased less than 1 percent in DT last six NNS , according to DT company ’s Chief NNP Officer for NNS , Thomas Breuer . “ PRP ’s an oligarchy , yes . But CD of DT reasons companies IN Sanofi Pasteur and GSK can provide NNS for a reasonable price is because PRP operate on such a large scale , ” he VBD . He points out IN Glaxo is not only targeting diseases in wealthy NNS . PRP has developed a malaria NN at a cost of $ 350 million ( €307 million ) , with no profit expected . Other gaps in NN development tend to be filled by philanthropic organizations such as DT Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation . PRP focus exclusively on less profitable but devastating diseases , such as malaria and dengue fever , most prevalent in developing NNS . CD NN hailed as a success story by industry is Prevnar 13 , which protects against pneumococcal pneumonia caused by DT bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae . DT product has generated cumulative sales of $ 25 billion for drug giant Pfizer since PRP acquired DT jab in 2009 through its purchase of Wyeth . Last NN was a sales record . Success is thanks to demand not only in DT developing NN , but RB in wealthy NNS . Prevnar is made by isolating compounds on DT surface of DT bacteria . But Elder of MSF says Prevnar illustrates what ’s wrong with DT market model . “ This is CD of DT NN ’s best selling NNS , but only two companies sell PRP : Pfizer and GSK , ” she VBD , referring to Glaxo , which sells a similar version . “ Pneumococcal pneumonia is DT leading cause of death in NNS under five … If PRP VBP to improve access , PRP have to improve competition , ” she added . British biotech Absynth Biologics plans to launch first - in - man trials for a NN to prevent methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , a major problem in western hospitals , in 2018 . But not without help : More than 60 percent of their revenue comes from a NN biotech fund , with DT rest from private equity . “ Without Innovate U.K. funding , I do n’t VB PRP MD be where PRP are at DT moment , ” she VBD . But DT fund now looks under threat after U.K. Chancellor George Osborne announced in autumn his intention to switch from grants to loans . Philanthropic funding to pay for NNS RB is n’t guaranteed . “ GAVI buys common NNS , but DT ’s on a charity basis and EX are major constraints in DT long term when PRP start losing funding and donors , ” VBD Elder of MSF . Europe , for its part , helps by supporting promising research into NNS through DT Innovative Medicines Initiative and Horizon2020 . DT European NNP Initiative , initially mandated to spur clinical development for a malaria NN , now RB supports candidates for other diseases of poverty . PRP helps coordinate projects funded by DT European Commission and others . Companies IN Absynth look to industry to develop and commercialize their products , since only big pharma has DT means to recover from candidate failures . But this model only serves to feed DT consolidation trend . DT industry is pushing for a pan-EU NNS plan to streamline things at DT European level . DT group wants a joint action from NNS to develop common immunization schedules , improve testing and availability , create flexibility in DT purchasing system , and spur greater confidence in NN . “ PRP understand DT Commission is reaching out to member NNS , and EX is a strong willingness to collaborate , ” Rappagliosi VBD . DT Commission VBD PRP was down to member NNS to discuss and accept any joint action on NN and cooperation , “ as their commitment as regards financial and human resources MD be required . ” If PRP did VB ahead , DT plan MD fit well with Europe ’s strides to jointly buy NNS . After DT 2009 H1N1 NN outbreak DT EU created DT joint procurement of JJ countermeasures ; last month , Austria was DT 23rd country to sign up . To date no NNS have been jointly bought , but DT first call for tender recently took place — albeit for JJ equipment — opening DT door for more such approaches , and potentially offering an opportunity for greater NNS access ."

For DT towers , at least , ghostly afterimages persist , albeit fading IN last night ’s nightmare . But DT anthrax attacks , clearly linked to 9/11 and DT Patriot Act , are IN lost letters , sent , but long forgotten . Such disappearing acts are a staple of American life these days . Memory has come upon hard times . With DT 2001 Anthrax Deception , Professor Graeme MacQueen , founding Director of DT Center for Peace Studies at McMaster University , calls PRP back to a careful reconsideration of DT anthrax attacks . PRP is an eloquent and pellucid lesson in inductive reasoning and deserves to stand with David Ray Griffin ’s brilliant multi-volume dissection of DT truth of DT tragic September 11th . MacQueen makes a powerful case for DT linkage of both events , a tie WDT binds both to insider elements deep within DT U.S. NN , perhaps in coordination with foreign elements . MacQueen ’s thesis is as follows : DT criminal anthrax attacks were conducted by a group of conspirators deep within DT U.S. NN who are linked to , or identical with , DT 9/11 perpetrators . Their purpose was to redefine DT Cold War into DT JJ War on Terror and in doing so weaken civil liberties in DT NNP NNPS and attack other nations . Obviously these are explosive charges WDT demand substantial evidence connected logically in a compelling thesis . MacQueen , in countering anti-conspiratorial thinkers of DT left and right who approach such issues with minds IN beds already made up , explains his method thus : “ DT tools of investigation are no different from those used to test other proposals . PRP use evidence and reason . In some NNS PRP will be able to make confident assertions and in other NNS PRP shall have to acknowledge IN PRP are speculating , but even in this second case PRP will do our best to ground our speculation in evidence . Ideology , national loyalty , outrage and ‘ common sense ’ will not do DT job . ” EX is no doubt IN his thesis , backed up by abundant evidence and some intriguing speculation , is a NN theory , just IN DT 9/11 Commission Report ’s explanation of 9/11 and DT Bush administration ’s neo-con and NN assisted conspiratorial tying of Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda to 9/11 and DT anthrax attacks . “ PRP MD have to look very hard to find anyone who does not hold a NN theory about 9/11 , ” he writes . “ And for this reason PRP is silly to denigrate NNS for holding a NN theory about this event . ” But good theory of any kind necessitates facts to make PRP credible , and MacQueen provides a plethora of these , while DT Bush administration made allegations and promises of evidence WDT was never delivered . He aptly quotes researcher Elias Davidsson ‘s evidentiary points concerning DT 9/11 hijackers : Not only does MacQueen provide copious documented facts to support his case , but he does PRP in a systematically logical way WDT leaves DT official story in shambles . If a crime were being prosecuted ( as PRP should , but war was waged instead ) , MacQueen marshals a case for conviction beyond a reasonable doubt . DT anthrax letter attacks began on September 18 , 2001 when DT first letters were mailed from Princeton , NNP Jersey . Between October 3 and November 20 twenty - two NNS were infected with dried anthrax spores and five died . Between October 6 and October 8 especially highly refined and aerosolized anthrax letters were sent to two key Democratic Senators , Thomas Daschle and Patrick Leahy . Before October 3 when DT first case , DT of Robert Stevens who died two days later , was diagnosed , DT FBI claimed IN “ no NN except DT perpetrators knew … IN DT attacks were in progress . ” Yet DT NNP York Times , between September 12 and October 3 , made reference to DT possibility of biological or chemical terrorist attacks 76 times , 27 references specifically to anthrax . JJ of these warnings came from NN leaders . Of course DT Times was home to Judith Miller , notorious for her deceptions regarding Iraq ’s WMD , and whose book Germs : Biological Weapons and America ’s Secret War , was about to be published in DT first few days in October . In DT book Miller et al. assert IN Iraq might use a terrorist group to unleash a bioweapon against DT NNP NNPS . Just coincidentally , throughout DT month of October as DT anthrax attacks became JJ , DT Bush administration and DT mainstream NN pushed DT claim IN Al Qaeda ( already accused of 9/11 ) and Saddam Hussein ( slyly implicated by innuendo ) were responsible for DT anthrax attacks . Once DT U.S. started bombing Afghanistan on October 7 , alleged Al Qaeda retaliation enhanced DT claim . No evidence was presented . DT Washington Post , vying with DT NNP York Times for Cassadran bragging rights , had published a September 27 article “ Al Qaeda NNP Have Crude Chemical Capabilities . ” This double foreign group suggestion – IN Bin Laden ’s group , NN - sponsored by Iraq , sent DT anthrax spores – was promoted vigorously throughout October . DT crude anthrax letters written to Tom Brokaw of NBC NNP and Senator Daschle with their 09 - 11-01 headings and Muslim extremist language , released to DT NN on October 23 , seemed to clinch DT case . By October 26 , once Bush had signed DT Patriot Act , DT case began falling apart , but not before DT two Democratic Senators , Daschle and Leahy , who had resisted ramrodding DT bill into law , had received their own lethal anthrax letters as possible reminders . When R. W. Apple Jr. wrote a NNP York Times front page article on October 18 , “ City of Power , City of Fears , ” and VBD , “ DT NN has been caught completely by surprise by DT anthrax attacks , ” he MD not have known about DT exercise termed Dark Winter , conducted four months earlier on June 22 - 23 , though PRP MD VB he might have known of DT plethora of references to anthrax in his own paper in DT few weeks before DT attacks became known . Maybe he thought DT Bush administration did n’t read DT NNP York Times for intelligence . MacQueen , in a greatly significant piece of sleuthing , however , lets PRP VB about Dark Winter , a biological warfare simulation planned and conducted by Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies / Center for Strategic and International Studies at Andrews Air Force Base with uncanny parallels to DT actual anthrax attacks . Some oddities follow . Dark Winter had anonymous letters sent to DT mainstream NN with threats of anthrax . Dark Winter claimed IN DT perpetrators are probably NN - sponsored international terrorists . Dark Winter claimed IN “ a prominent Iraqi defector is claiming Iraq arranged DT bioweapons attacks on DT U.S. through intermediaries . ” Dark Winter concludes IN DT attacks necessitate harsh restrictions on civil liberties , possibly Martial Rule . Dark Winter has a fictional television anchor announce IN “ still no group claims responsibility for unleashing DT smallpox NN , but NCR has learned IN Iraq MD have provided DT technology behind DT attack to terrorist groups based in Afghanistan . ” And yes , not to be missed , PRP learn IN Dark Winter ’s simulation ’s actors included Apple ’s NNP York Times ’ colleague Judith Miller , soon to be DT NNP York Times best - selling author of Germs , playing a reporter for DT NNP York Times ; James Woolsey , former CIA Director and supporter of DT Project for DT NNP America Century ( PRP ’ll need a JJ Pearl Harbor , folks ) ; and Jerome Hauer , a member of DT Committee on DT Present Danger , and “ an important figure in DT linking of DT 9/11 attacks and DT anthrax attacks , ” who played DT FEMA director . Once DT NN ’s accusations against Al Qaeda and Iraq fell apart but DT Patriot Act had become law , NSA spying commenced , and DT war in Afghanistan proceeded apace , DT FBI changed its tune and pursued DT lone wolf perpetrator theory , first accusing a scientist named Steven Hatfill and then , after he sued and eventually received $ 5.82 million in compensation , PRP accused Bruce Ivins , a scientist working on an anthrax NN at Fort Derrick in Maryland . MacQueen shows in detail how DT claim came apart and resulted in a case without credibility but with Ivins committing suicide . But , he concludes , DT Ivins accusation served its purpose of diverting attention from DT real reason for DT anthrax attacks and its culprits . Finally , MacQueen details how DT anthrax evidence leads to some of DT alleged 9/11 hijackers in Florida as PRP lay down a trail of incriminating “ evidence ” PRP were meant to follow , linking crop - dusters / anthrax to 9/11 . Mohamed Atta , DT alleged 9/11 ringleader , supposedly went into a U.S. Department of Agriculture office seeking a $ 650,000 loan to buy and enlarge a crop-duster . He made sure DT agent knew and MD spell his name , and when she balked at DT loan , “ he asked what MD stop him from VBG around her desk , cutting her throat , and taking DT money from DT large safe in DT office . ” He then admired a photo of Washington , D.C. , asked to buy PRP , inquired about security at DT NNP Trade Center , implied he was associated with Al Qaeda , and told her IN Bin Laden “ ‘ MD someday be known as DT NN ’s greatest leader . ’ “ MacQueen sardonically comments , “ And DT is DT story of how a terrorist leader , engaged in a top - secret operation , sought a NN loan to help him with his plan . ” For CD familiar with Lee Harvey Oswald ’s ( or his double ’s ) antics to make himself unforgettable on visits to a car dealership and a rifle range before JFK ’s assassination , DT Atta charade should ring a bell . MacQueen makes a powerful case IN DT various crop-duster incidents were “ disinformation ” and IN their purpose was to link 9/11 to DT anthrax attacks and , notably , to Iraq . He notes IN PRP was RB at this NN IN DT fictitious story of Atta meeting with an Iraqi intelligence agent in Prague was widely circulated to “ solidify this connection . ” He argues IN once DT FBI admitted IN DT anthrax attacks were not a foreign operation but DT claim had served its purpose , DT crop - duster stories vanished into obscurity . However , he concludes , “ Given IN DT anthrax attacks were a domestic operation , and given IN DT alleged hijackers were implicated in DT operation prior to its occurrence , DT conclusion cannot be avoided : DT 9/11 attacks were RB a domestic operation . ” But as few can forget , on February 5 , 2003 at DT UN Security Council , DT Iraq / anthrax / crop - duster claim arose from its sleep in DT infamous , fraudulent presentation by Colin Powell as he slyly tied Iraq back to DT anthrax attacks and shilled for war against Iraq . DT feat of propaganda was but CD of at least 532 occasions when eight top members of DT Bush administration made at least 936 false statements on Iraq ’s possession of weapons of mass destruction and its links to Al Qaeda , according to a NN conducted by DT Center for NNP Integrity and DT Fund for Independence in Journalism and released in 2008 . Anyone concerned about DT truth behind 9/11 and DT anthrax attacks should read this profoundly important book . PRP is filled with tight argumentation backed by solid evidence , and even DT speculative parts ring true . In closing I will mention MacQueen ’s fascinating penultimate chapter wherein he speculates about DT significance of DT repeated word “ unthinkable ” by DT NN and NN officials following George W. Bush ’s use of DT term “ rethink DT unthinkable ” in a NNP 1 , 2001 speech at DT National Defense University . DT mainstream NN used DT word “ unthinkable ” repetitively throughout October 2001 when referring to DT anthrax attacks . And CD of DT early anthrax threatening letters sent to Tom Brokaw , begins : “ DT Unthinkabel ” ( sic ) – showing , of course , how Muslim terrorists ca n’t spell English . “ EX is a pattern here , ” MacQueen writes . Words matter , and those repeated enough matter more , words such as ground zero , homeland , and unthinkable . “ He who wants to persuade should not put his trust in DT right argument , ” Joseph Conrad wrote in Lord Jim . “ DT power of sound has always been greater than DT power of sense . ” MacQueen has chosen sense through argument , and rather than dismissing his as unthinkable , thinking NNS everywhere should engage PRP . DT 2001 anthrax letter attacks in DT NNP NNPS killed five NNS and wounded dozens . PRP were widely blamed on extremist Muslims and their backers and used to support DT invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq . PRP were RB used to justify and hasten DT passage of DT USA PATRIOT Act , which was being presented to Congress just as DT first anthrax victim grew ill . In October 2001 , CD of DT hypotheses WDT gained ground was DT of DT Double Perpetrator , DT claim IN al - Qaeda was carrying out DT attacks with DT support of Iraq . Much evidence was put forth to support this Double Perpetrator hypothesis but independent NNS soon discovered IN DT anthrax spores came from a domestic lab in DT NNP serving DT military and intelligence communities , not from al - Qaeda or Iraq . DT FBI then quickly claimed IN an individual was responsible for DT attacks and began noisily looking for this “ lone wolf . ” In 2008 DT Bureau named Dr. Bruce Ivins of DT NNP Army NNP Institute of Infectious NNP as DT “ anthrax killer . ” Although DT FBI remains committed to DT Ivins hypothesis , DT case has been disintegrating for DT last three NNS . Currently , PRP is justly held in contempt not merely by NNS who worked with Ivins but by JJ journalists as well as several NNP senators . But this raises DT question : if Ivins did not commit this crime , who did ? This book presents evidence to support DT following points : ( a) DT anthrax attacks were carried out by a group of perpetrators , not by a “ lone wolf . ” DT attacks were , therefore , DT result of a NN — by definition a plan by two or more NNS , made in secret and resulting in an immoral or illegal act . ( b) DT group WDT carried out this crime consisted , in whole or in part , of insiders deep within DT NNP NN apparatus . ( c) These insiders were DT same NNS who planned DT 9/11 attacks (d) DT anthrax attacks were meant to facilitate a seizure of power by DT executive branch of NN through intimidation of Congress and NNP civil society . PRP were RB designed to achieve JJ acquiescence to and support for DT redefinition of NNP foreign policy , replacing DT Cold War with a JJ and aggressive JJ conflict framework , DT JJ War on Terror ."

With DT U.S. death toll approaching 90,000 , JJ NN experts described DT NN ’s NN timetable as ambitious — perhaps overly so . “ Everything MD have to break in DT right way , and EX are JJ ways IN PRP might not work , ” VBD Tom Inglesby , director of DT Center for NNP Security at Johns Hopkins University , interviewed on NBC ’s “ Meet DT Press . ” “ So I do n’t VB PRP should bank on PRP , ” he VBD , calling a NN this NN “ far from a sure thing . ” Similar caution was voiced by Tom Frieden , a former head of DT Centers for NNP Control and Prevention . Interviewed on “ Fox NNP Sunday , ” he VBD a NN was “ DT single most important weapon PRP MD develop against this NN , ” but “ PRP do n’t have CD yet . ” “ PRP hope PRP will , ” Frieden VBD . “ PRP hope PRP will be soon , but PRP can not count on PRP . ” Even if a NN is developed , logistical challenges to mass inoculation MD be daunting , VBD former Food and Drug Administration head Scott Gottlieb . “ A lot of things can VB wrong , ” Gottlieb VBD on CBS ’ “ Face DT Nation . “ “ A lot of things can be delayed . PRP ’s very hard to VB to DT point where PRP ’re manufacturing at high , high quantities . ” DT U.S. has DT NN ’s highest known tally of NN infections , with more than 1.5 million confirmed NNS . But Azar VBD an overall plateau in NNS and deaths was ample grounds for moving ahead with restarting DT economy . “ PRP are in a position to be able to reopen now , ” Azar VBD on CNN . He RB played down any alarm over televised images of packed bars and restaurants in NNS WDT have eased shutdowns , casting those who fail to follow physical - distancing guidelines as a minority . “ In any individual instance , PRP ’re VBG to see NNS doing things WDT are irresponsible , ” he VBD . “ DT ’s part of DT freedom WDT PRP have here in America . ” Other NNP allies used similarly benign language to describe crowding in JJ places and newly reopened establishments . “ Well , I certainly see a small subset of Wisconsinites celebrating a little freedom , ” VBD Sen. Ron Johnson ( R - Wis. ) , interviewed on CNN . But he VBD most NNS were “ being very responsible ” in terms of mask - wearing and physical distancing . Azar RB VBD IN predicted spikes of infection had not materialized in NNS such as Georgia and Florida , which moved quickly to reopen , although he acknowledged IN PRP was “ still early days . ” An upsurge in illness probably MD take a couple of weeks to detect since JJ NNS do n’t develop symptoms right away . Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio , a Republican who has sometimes challenged NNP ’s push for a speedy end to shutdowns , VBD he hoped to avoid a resurgence in his NN as restrictions are eased . “ PRP certainly hope PRP do n’t see DT , ” he VBD on CNN , noting IN “ so much is in every individual ’s control . ” Experts such as Inglesby VBD an easing in DT growth of DT U.S. caseload should be seen as proof IN shutdowns worked , rather than a signal IN PRP should not have been imposed in DT first place . “ I VBP lockdowns were necessary , ” he VBD . “ PRP actually have changed DT course of DT epidemic in DT NNP NNPS . ” He VBD with DT curve moving in DT right direction , PRP was “ now appropriate for NNS to be thinking about how to very carefully reopen , and do PRP as safely as possible . ” Frieden , DT former CDC head , predicted a long and uneven course for outbreaks in individual NNS , warning IN too - rapid lifting of restrictions MD bring painful JJ setbacks . “ PRP ’re likely to see multiple waves in different parts of DT country , ” he VBD . “ If PRP VBP too fast , PRP will backfire . ” NNP spent DT weekend at Camp David , DT presidential retreat in Maryland , holding strategy sessions on subjects including DT NN push . “ PRP did a lot of terrific meetings , ” he told reporters upon returning to DT White House on Sunday . “ Tremendous progress is being made on JJ fronts , including coming up with a cure for this horrible plague WDT has beset our country . ” At DT same NN , a senior aide unleashed an angry JJ tirade at Richard Bright , a NN expert turned whistleblower who told Congress last week IN DT administration ignored early warnings about DT perils of DT NN . White House trade advisor Peter Navarro , appearing on ABC ’s “ This Week , ” VBD Bright , who was ousted from his post as DT head of a federal JJ research agency and refused reassignment to a lesser post , had “ deserted ” DT administration at a moment of “ tragedy . ” “ PRP MD have used him on DT battlefield , ” VBD Navarro , who refused an invitation to testify before DT same congressional subcommittee as Bright did ."

Q : My daughter is two NNS old . PRP got her checked for NN as she does not respond to her name and neither does she speak any word . Both of PRP are working due to which PRP are not able to interact with her at all ; hardly 5 - 10 minutes in DT day . She stays with her grandparents who take care of her needs IN food , bath etc. but PRP do not interact with her either . She keeps watching TV all DT NN . She has started doing things IN drinking NN from tumbler etc. only after learning PRP from TV . She does not respond to her name . Till now none of PRP call her by any particular name . PRP use different names or no name at all . She plays on her own , takes care of herself IN walking carefully on slippery floor or catching hold of railing while on steps . But she does not walk on slopes and if she does , she takes calculated steps . She does not have any eye contact with PRP . Though PRP has improved in last few days but is still minimal . She does not stick to CD toy for long and soon gets bored of PRP . She does not speak any meaningful words IN mama or papa . She does not interact with any NNS of her own age group and PRP do n't VB if she will do so in future . She seems to VB older NNS ( 7 - 8 NNS old ) and tries to interact with them when she goes to DT park - but walks off on her own if EX is no immediate response from them . She does not try to interact or play with them . PRP showed her to a child specialist in Mumbai who advised a hearing test and a psychological test . Her hearing was normal but DT psychological tests say IN she has few autistic features . Hence her reaction MD be explained by lack of interaction and proper stimuli . Do PRP need to VB for another evaluation for NN ? If she indeed is autistic , then how to deal with this ? Is NN curable and will she be able to live a normal life when she grows up ? Will she be dependent on someone in future ? A: DT fact IN your daughter has shown improvement with only a little stimulation from DT parents is very hopeful . Please ensure IN PRP talk to her , looking at her and playing with her , when she is in DT mood for PRP . PRP does seem a pity IN she has spent two NNS without much interaction with parents or grandparents . Having TV on all DT NN will just be noise , from DT child 's point of view . Cut down her TV watching and give her things IN stuffed toys , building blocks and even spoons and cups to play with and manipulate . Perhaps all four of PRP should agree on calling her by CD name , giving her a chance to develop an identity and a name . At this age , most NNS will move from CD activity to another . A short attention span by itself is not a cause for worry . PRP is good to hear IN your daughter tries to make contact with older NNS . Take her out to DT park and to friends ' homes , where she can meet other NNS . Help her along if she is shy , but do not force her in any way . Be inventive in capturing her interest . I VBP DT story telling and reading from picture books will be good activities for DT daily routine . Singing for her and with her will make DT home more lively for DT little girl . Both parents need to increase DT NN spent with her . Your expressions of affection ( IN hugging her and holding her ) will give her a feeling of security . I VBP IN cheerful and active interactions with DT child will bring her close to DT levels of speech and participation of other two NN old NNS . Just to be sure IN she has no special problem . PRP should consult a specialist in NN , if PRP continue to have DT feeling IN your child is not responsive ."

And DT total of confirmed and probable NNS is 1,404 . EX is CD additional recovered case and this total is now 1,462 and EX are just 21 remaining active NNS of NN - CD . EX are no additional deaths to report . And , currently , EX is nobody in hospital with NNP - CD following DT discharge of a person from Middlemore Hospital . Yesterday , our laboratories processed 4,279 tests . So our grand total of tests undertaken to date in NNP Zealand is 267,435 . Just an update on DT NZ NNP Tracer app , EX are now 422,000 registrations on DT - an increase of 17,000 since yesterday . Just to remind NNS , IN even registering , which provides your up - to - date contact details with DT Ministry of NNP is incredibly helpful for both PRP and for PRP and our wider efforts . So I continue to encourage to download DT app . EX are now over 17,000 QR posters available in businesses around NNP Zealand , representing DT unique NNP Zealand business number and those are DT ones WDT work with DT NZ NNP Tracer app . PRP 're launching another app today called Āwhina for NN care and professional staff . PRP provides them with access to information on DT updated case definition , on local clinical pathways , and on guidance around use of personal protective equipment amongst other things . PRP 're very pleased to be able to provide DT information to our NN professional workforce so PRP 's available on their mobile device and PRP is updated as PRP is updated on our website . PRP 've worked on DT app with feedback and input from NNS across DT system . Finally , on another important topic , back in alert level 4 , I certainly noticed , and PRP MD well have , EX were JJ NNS out walking or cycling to VB some fresh air and physical activity to break DT monotony of being inside . With less traffic on DT roads , I have to say , PRP was both easy and very enjoyable . Now EX is obviously more traffic on DT road under alert level 2 , but I MD encourage NNS to still try and build in some physical activity into your days . I VBP PRP 's getting more difficult with shorter and colder days , especially those mornings , but if PRP can retain DT physical activity and build PRP into your day , perhaps for local trips - whether PRP 's school , work or to DT shops - DT will help PRP stay well over winter . What PRP MD notice is your local councils providing more space for walking and cycling to make PRP easier . I commend DT councils for doing this . I strongly encourage NNS to make DT most of DT . So PRP 'll cooperate - continue to work , as PRP have been , with DT Ministry of Transport , around DT benefits of walking and cycling where EX is NN - CD or not . NN : MD PRP be comfortable with DT country moving to level 1 earlier than a month away ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : DT advice PRP 've given , and this was DT basis for DT Cabinet discussion , and their decision on Monday was to first of all to move DT group side up to 100 and then -- size up to 100 and then remain in full alert level 2 for a period of two weeks before moving to alert level 1 . But I 'm RB aware as DT Prime Minister VBD on Monday PRP will be reconsidering DT aLe letter level set -- alert level settings on June 2 . DT ultimate decision remains with cabinet . NN : What why do PRP need to say in alert level 2 for so long ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : DT main thing is PRP need to be certain IN DT cumulative result of activities means our border procedures are safe and secure especially as contemplate to a possible move to a bubble with Australia and / or more NNS coming into DT country . NN : Have PRP seen Winston Peters this morning VBD PRP should be in level 1 already and have a Trans - Tasman bubble arranged ? MD DT be a workable possibility at DT moment ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : I can't speak for DT Deputy Prime Minister 's comments . What I can say is IN PRP are working hard on what alert level 1 will look IN . And RB separately , but obviously linked very hard with DT airline industry , airports , foreign affairs and of course our counterparts in Australia , on what MD need to be in place to allow a Trans - Tasman bubble , DT key thing is WDT MD require both NNS have confidence in DT arrangement . NN : DT MD be a no right now , from today , tomorrow , immediate future ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : As I say , PRP is work actively under way but PRP MD require decisions of cabinets of both NNS before a Trans - Tasman bubble MD VB ahead . Our job is to provide really good advice on what needs to be in place both in terms of DT pattern of NNS in each country but RB at DT border and on flights to help make sure EX was no risk of transmission of any NNS between NNS . NN : I understand IN DT mask - wearing has been completed . Is DT DT case ? When was an announcement made ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : EX was a review of DT scientific evidence and literature a couple of weeks ago , which is DT NN on our website . PRP have asked for further advice from our different technical advisory groups , including our overall technical advisory group . EX is not a unanimous view on any of those groups but DT weight of DT rue is still IN our current policy , which is not to either recommend or require widespread use of masks , is DT right NN at this point in NN . But PRP 're just finising -- finalising DT . PRP will make an updated statement available in DT next day or two . NN : Have PRP changed your position on wearing masks in places IN JJ transport ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : No , PRP 're not . DT use of masks needs to be put in DT context of DT situation PRP 're in right now , alert level 2 VBG to alert level 1 with a record fifth day in - a - row with no JJ NNS and no evidence of community transmission . DT 's DT evidence WDT will keep NNS safe along with physical distancing . NN : Some say PRP MD VB to see international students who VBP to VB at DT University of Auckland 's NNP School to be able to enter DT country . Do PRP VB PRP 's safe to have some students come in if PRP 're paying to stay at hostels ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : This is a piece of work under way , discussions are happening , PRP 're involved in them , led by our education colleagues . DT key thing is , any group coming into DT country - EX 's been publicity about some particular NNS with particular skills who 've come in over DT last few weeks under a special exemptions policy , anyone who comes into DT country needs to do so in a way WDT complies with DT 14 - day self or managed isolation , except in very rare circumstances PRP can be very confident DT risk is low . Yes , DT does open up DT option of international students coming into DT country and PRP MD need to make sure IN all DT arrangements were in place to do so safely . NN : What alert level will DT country have to be at for PRP to feel comfortable to establish a Trans - Tasman bubble ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : I VBP DT 's depend on both governments deciding DT risks are able to be managed within an appropriate process . I VBP PRP VBD this on Monday - PRP is not dependent on PRP being in alert level 1 but dependent on decision - makers in both NNS agreeing to PRP . NN : VBG back to allowing NNS back into DT country , MD PRP still recommend PRP stay at hotels in Christchurch or Auckland or MD PRP envisage a NN PRP MD self - isolate at home as PRP did before ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : At this point in NN , because DT border is so important for PRP to keep DT infection out of DT country , PRP 're maintaining DT position IN PRP requires , either , quarantine or supervised isolation at CD of DT facilities WDT are setup in Auckland or Christchurch . NN : Is is this DT first NN -- is this DT first NN EX 's been no - CD in hospital for NNP - CD since DT pandemic lockdown began ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : I VBP PRP is , absolutely , yes , PRP 've had a number of NNS in hospital . Never a big number but I VBP this is DT first NN in a couple of months PRP have n't had someone in hospital . DT 's another good position to be in . NN : Yesterday PRP spoke a bit about exemptions PRP signed off on . Do PRP sign off on them all ? How JJ have PRP signed off on for NNS in DT screen industry ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : DT ones in screen industry I do n't sign - off on . PRP 're signed off by Minister Twyford and PRP 're related to specific commercial ventures . DT very small number I sign off on are around workers with very particular skills , IN EX were some engineers in Europe what came to fix DT so - called "" poo "" pipe here in Wellington . And CD I mentioned yesterday who is here to repair X - ray machines . DT ones about commercial ventures are not something I sign off on . However , PRP have to comply with DT very strict JJ NN measures in place for earn else . PRP -- everyone else . PRP require DT 14 - day quarantine period . NN : Do PRP VB how JJ have been signed off on ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : In DT latter category ? REPORTER : In both . Dr Ashley Bloomfield : I 've signed off on in a handful . I should say those are NNS who do n't need to do DT 14 - day quarantine , assuming PRP 've fulfilled a number of requirements . In DT case of DT other group , PRP 's somewhere between CD and 200 but Minister Twyford is DT person who will VB DT exact numbers RB . NN : On DT point of allowing further NNS in , some of DT arrangements WDT these NNS are quarantining overseas rather than quarantining when PRP VBP here ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : Not at this point in NN . But DT is something PRP are looking at . PRP MD need to be comfort in DT quarantine arrangements in DT - at DT destination , where PRP 're coming from - sorry , at DT point of where PRP 're coming from and be confident PRP were following DT same strict JJ NN measures PRP have in place here . PRP is something PRP 're looking at a possibility . NN : Is DT something PRP MD move to of sort of RB being a visa or something requirement and proof IN PRP have managed to self - isolate and / or quarantine in their country of residence before coming to NNP Zealand and then PRP MD VB straight into their role ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : Yes , DT 's absolutely an option . Another option - PRP 're seeing some NNS do this - is requiring testing before NNS depart from their departure point in a timely way . Both those are options . But at this point in NN , PRP 're not using either of those options but PRP are options for DT future . NN : Note IN DT NN 's response to PPE requests internationally is currently no , can PRP say which NNS have asked for help with PPE ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : No , I do n't VB which NNS have asked DT but PRP can provide DT information . NN : PRP MD have seen NNS wearing makeshift masks over DT mouth , nose area . Does DT offer any value for NNS taking those measures ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : I 'm not discouraging NNS from doing PRP . If PRP 're VBG to use a mask or face covering , VB how to do DT safely . PRP makes PRP even more careful to use careful hand hygiene . Because DT 's where DT potential for using face masks can be , with touching inanimate objects and then touching DT face . PRP have done reviews where NN care staff MD have got infected from - on more than CD occasion PRP believe PRP is from contaminated surfaces even though PRP were wearing full PPE . I can't overstate DT importance of NNS using good hand hygiene whether using a face covering or not . NN : Are PRP happy with where testing numbers are at ? PRP 's dropped off over DT last couple of days . Is DT to be expected ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : First of all , PRP always see a drop over DT weekend and DT tends to flow through into DT Monday and Tuesday numbers . PRP 's coming up again , I VBP , today . PRP were 4,279 tests processed yesterday . Yes , PRP will expect to see DT numbers come down because - for two reasons . First of all , through DT last couple of months PRP 've been testing for NNS with symptoms . PRP continue to do DT , and DT is IN DT vast majority of DT testing WDT 's happening . Anyone who fits DT case information on our website , which is very broad still . But secondly , PRP were doing a lot of testing to try and identify if EX was any hidden NN out RB in DT community . Now IN PRP 's clear it's not , PRP 'll be shifting DT focus for DT testing to DT border because DT 's DT area where PRP 'll have DT most risk . EX is a very specific plan being developed around IN which CD PRP has been through cabinet and approved will become in operation from 8 June . PRP is testing NNS and looking for any breach at DT border with more testing RB . NN : Because of our success in tackling NN - CD , is PRP VBG to affect our chances if EX 's a NN created internationally , will PRP affect our chances of getting DT NN if PRP 're a country as seen as doing well and does n't need PRP as badly as other NNS ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : I should n't VB so . PRP 's still a long way off , for a start . Secondly , as PRP will have seen in DT NN strategy WDT was publicised earlier in DT week PRP have a number of irons in DT fire RB to make sure IN PRP have access to a NN as soon as PRP 's available , and RB planning for making sure IN PRP can vaccinate our population . NN : Following on what PRP were saying RB , JJ testing at DT borders , does DT mean PRP MD see more NNS coming through DT borders ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : Ah , regardless of whether PRP 're seeing more NNS coming through DT borders what PRP 're looking at is whether PRP routinely test everyone coming through DT border at some point during their quarantine period . But RB , PRP 's about testing of NNS who are working at DT border , either at airports or ports , or in those quarantine facilities . So DT will be where DT focus of our asymptomatic testing will be . NN : Back to masks , where does DT discrepancy lie at DT moment ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : EX are a range of views whether widespread mask use whether on JJ transport or in other JJ settings by DT general NN is worth doing from a sense of IN DT benefits outweigh DT potential risks at this point in NN . But PRP 's just CD of those things WDT 's under active conversation . NN : CD question from our sports team . DT Tokyo Olympics have been postponed to DT middle of next NN . Do PRP VB a NN MD be ready by DT NN , and do PRP VB DT Olympics should VB ahead if EX is n't a NN and PRP are VBG to have thousands of athletes around ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : I 'm prepared to answer most questions but I do n't VB I can offer any sound insights into DT particular issue . I 'm sorry . OK . Thank PRP very much , everybody ."

Eight of these have already made PRP to clinical trials in humans , and another 94 are in DT pre-clinical evaluation stage . These candidates RB fall into eight different categories of NN development strategy WDT are being explored . While PRP still does n’t guarantee success , this is in effect DT biological equivalent of hedging our bets in DT hope IN CD of DT strategies will pay off . But if and when a successful NN is found , PRP still have to manufacture enough of PRP to immunise huge numbers of NNS all around DT NN . And how long this will take , and what is involved , will depend on which strategy is found to work , because different NNS are made in different ways . Despite arguments about lack of preparedness concerning PPE and testing , DT UK has been on DT front foot when PRP comes to identifying suitable candidate NNS . PRP is leading DT charge to ramp up production , having invested more than any other country in doing so , according to DT NN secretary , Matt Hancock . DT UK’s two leading candidate NNS , being developed by DT University of Oxford and Imperial College London respectively , both use very different approaches WDT were already under investigation in DT lab for other diseases . Oxford ’s candidate , ChAdOx1 nCoV - CD , uses a genetically modified chimpanzee adenovirus as a “ vector ” to carry DT genetic sequence of a protein from DT NN - CD NN to DT human body . DT body can then learn to recognise DT NN and start producing antibodies to fight PRP . This is DT same technique DT team previously developed for DT closely related Mers NN , which showed promise in animal and early - stage human testing . Usually NN development takes NNS , but human clinical trials for DT Oxford NN candidate are underway , just three months after DT genetic sequence of DT NN was released for NN . This is thanks to a specialist adenovirus manufacturing platform adapted as part of work by DT EPSRC UCL - Oxford Future NNP Manufacturing Research Hub ( Vax Hub ) , as well as next - generation gene sequencing methods WDT have enabled DT team to proceed at breakneck speed . Pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has announced PRP will develop , manufacture and distribute DT NN ( if PRP ’s successful ) around DT NN . But to do this , PRP will need to find a way to scale up production without critically affecting DT supply of other vital NNS . JJ manufacturing facilities are adept at producing millions of NN doses against influenza , measles and polio . PRP have strategies in place to step up production at times of increased demand , such as for DT annual winter NN season . But PRP are in unprecedented times , and DT JJ demand for a safe and effective NN NN will be on a scale never before seen , likely resulting in key production and distribution bottlenecks . NN production requires complex manufacturing processes involving DT production of living organisms WDT , in turn , generate DT genetically - modified NN on which DT NN is based . And PRP must VB DT manufacturing right . These NNS will be administered to healthy NNS to generate immunity to DT NN . Any faults MD risk their safety and a long - term loss of JJ confidence . But EX is cause for cautious optimism . As PRP await DT clinical trial outcomes for DT Oxford NN , behind DT scenes EX has been a flurry of activity to adapt existing manufacturing technologies and processes to make DT adenovirus vector PRP relies on . DT manufacturing process for DT Oxford NN will begin by encoding DT NN surface protein into DT adenovirus vector . “ Producer cells ” , usually human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) cells , will then be used as mini-factories to produce DT vector particles . DT producer cells will be grown at scale in a bioreactor , a vessel WDT tightly controls DT environmental conditions to optimise cell growth . DT cells will then be put through a series of steps to purify and concentrate DT final adenovirus vector , including filtration and centrifugation ( spinning PRP very fast in order to separate different particles ) . Finally , DT solution will be formulated into a usable product and kept stable by storing PRP between 2 °C and 8°C . However , DT final concentration of DT solution can vary significantly , and PRP is DT lack of an effective manufacturing process to resolve this problem WDT limits current production on a mass scale . This will be DT significant challenge AstraZeneca will face in translating DT lab - based Oxford process to something akin to industrial manufacturing . Of course , all these efforts will only come into play if DT Oxford NN ( or potentially another in DT same category ) is found to work . Other NN candidates , such as DT being developed by Imperial , will require a substantially different manufacturing process . In these unprecedented times , DT NN ’s NN experts will have to work with unprecedented speed and innovation to deliver a way to save potentially millions of lives and start returning society to normal ."

Horowitz , DMD , MA , MPH Author of thirteen books including DT national bestseller , Emerging Viruses : AIDS & Ebola - Nature , Accident or Intentional ? and Death in DT Air : Globalism , Terrorism and Toxic Warfare 4 -2-3 Abstract Rather than a JJ NN emergency , DT "" Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome , "" generally called SARS , is best diagnosed as a "" Sickening and Repulsive Scam . "" This article argues IN this unprecedented viral attack is , alternatively , an ingenious social experiment featuring institutionalized bioterrorism for widespread psycho-social control . DT outcome of this experiment , whether PRP leads to population reduction or not , depends on PRP . Background PRP are about to read much neglected truths pertaining to this bizarre JJ pneumonia - JJ illness called SARS . Authorities explain this acronym for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome as simply DT latest threat in an ongoing series of attacks on humanity by mysteriously mutating "" supergerms . "" Yet , a careful NN of this multi- disciplinary subjectÊ reveals something amiss far more insidious and deadly than SARS . This spreading scourge of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome stretching from Asia to North America has all DT earmarks of a novel social experiment in population manipulation aimed to culture DT mass mind for DT arrival of "" DT Big NNP "" - a biological agent WDT will facilitate decimation of approximately a third to half of DT NN 's population , in keeping with current official population reduction objectives . Naturally PRP MD be disinclined to believe DT above sentence . Open - mindedness in this domain threatens exposure to a "" Twilight Zone "" of knowledge in which reality is far stranger than fiction . Your first instinct , therefore , might be to close this page in favor of DT next SARS site WDT promises more of DT standard treatments broadcast on every official NN page and NN report on this subject . But , if PRP choose to have your worldview shattered by considering DT little known truths surrounding Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome , then continue reading . . . . "" No great epidemic has ever evolved divorced from major socio- political upheaval . "" Leonard G. Horowitz , D.M.D. , M.A. , M.P.H . Emerging Viruses presentation , 1996 Introduction My name is Dr. Leonard Horowitz , and I will be your SARS tour guide on this website . As a Harvard graduate in JJ NN , and expert in DT fields of JJ sociology , behavioral NN , and emerging diseases , I am best known for my work exposing DT man-made origin of HIV / AIDS in DT national bestselling book , Emerging Viruses : AIDS & Ebola - Nature , Accident or Intentional ? ( Tetrahedron Press , 1998 ; 1-888-508-4787 ; http://www.healthyworlddistributing.com/detail.aspx?ID=4) This was my tenth book WDT American grassroots activists , JJ physicians and NNS included , made a national bestseller . U.S. NN documents WDT I reprinted for DT first NN for DT NN to see were strong endorsements for this work . Included here are stunning and tragic contracts under which numerous AIDS - JJ and Ebola - IN viruses were bioengineered by DT U.S. Army 's 6th leading biological weapons contractor - Litton Bionetics - a JJ subsidiary of DT mega-military weapons contractor called Litton Industries . PRP can VB free information on this man-made NN - transmitted theory of AIDS at http://www.originofAIDS.com. Here I focus your attention on SARS , and what mainstream sources of information are withholding about this JJ pandemic . This narrative was written immediately following my return from Total NNP 2003 - anÊ alternative JJ conference in Toronto , Canada , held March 27 - 30 , 2003 . I landed in Toronto DT day IN SARS began dominating front page headlines in every major newspaper in DT country . Five consecutive days of unprecedented NN blitz in Canada 's largest city over DT Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome left DT entire population frightened and bewildered . Having been well - trained in NN NN promotion and persuasion methods from my behavioral NN studies at Harvard University , I concluded IN something akin to a social experiment was underway . With SARS , NNS were being frightened beyond reason , I realized . DT classic definition of phobia was being manifested on a social , if not JJ , scale . Surely DT SARS death rate , approximately 3 % , was insufficient cause for such widespread panic . DT NN successfully whipped DT Canadian population into a trembling mass of masked and quarantined "" sheeple . "" Officials were forced to direct DT closing of hospitals , restaurants , schools , and workplaces with only two deaths reported at DT onset of DT NN onslaught . Within a few days , more than a thousand healthcare workers volunteered for home quarantine because of SARS . Otherwise , PRP faced legal arrest and incarceration as advised by DT NNP NNP Organization . PRP will find JJ of these reports from Canada 's daily newspapers , documenting these facts , as well as incoming American press reports , in DT archive files of this website . Mission I have dedicated this website to examining DT social and political implications , as well as DT correlates ( i.e. , things related to ) and antecedents ( i.e. , factors or events WDT predated or precipitated ) this JJ SARS pandemic . By examining this illness 's etiology , which lies more in DT realm of JJ politics , corporate profits , and population control , than elsewhere , this information offers educated NNS an alternative to DT fright and irrational behaviors promulgated by "" mainstream "" propagandists including NN sources and NN officials better known as "" spin doctors . "" Most intelligent persons will conclude from DT following information IN this JJ microbial attack was premeditated and precedent - setting . In other words , SARS is a well orchestrated social experiment . Who is behind this SARS madness ? I accept DT risk of triggering your "" NN theory "" buttons by identifying DT widely recognized "" JJ military - JJ - petrochemical - pharmaceutical cartel "" as DT only suspect WDT can wield DT powers necessary to effect these frightening outcomes . Although PRP MD find PRP comforting to simply consider this a NN theory , I view SARS is a huge NN with very few witting villains . Clearly , what PRP are witnessing is a well organized terror campaign carried out by mostly well - meaning , yet grossly ignorant , "" authorities "" - medically indoctrinated and virtually hypnotized "" Manchurian candidates "" if PRP will allow me to postulate . Indeed , NNS are dying from SARS . Yet , I diagnose this illness , by JJ - sociological parameters , as a grotesque scam perpetrated for a greater purpose than simply fueling a multi-billion dollar "" cottage NN industry , "" as some analysts have written . Alternatively , I propose IN Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome , MD be best diagnosed by SARS 's telltale dependence on DT propaganda used to herald its presence , prompt hysteria , and broadly engage social and JJ resources . In military intelligence circles this is called standard "" psychological operations "" ( PSYOPs ) . I further suggest this fright 's likeliest purpose is in facilitating evolving JJ and political agendas WDT ultimately include targeting approximately half DT NN 's current population for elimination . Much of this will be accomplished , not with SARS , but quite effectively and efficiently by DT widely anticipated "" Big NNP "" discussed later on this website in a feature article written for DT Associated Press by Emma Ross . "" [ T ] here 's fame , fortune , and big budgets in sounding DT ' emerging infection ' alarm and warning of our terrible folly in being unprepared . "" Michael Fumento , National Post , March 28 , 2003 This concept of a microbiological Armageddon is not JJ to most readers . "" Experts "" have been predicting DT arrival of a super - plague for decades . What is HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS about DT mysterious and terrifying arrival of SARS is its timing . PRP arrived virtually synchronous with DT JJ war on terrorism , and DT Anglo - American war with Iraq . This is pathognomonic ( i.e. , symptomatic and characteristic ) of what is predicted and explained in DT book , Death in DT Air : Globalism , Terrorism and Toxic Warfare ( Tetrahedron Publishing Group , 2001 ; http://www.healthyworlddistributing.com/detail.aspx?ID=3), a prophetically - titled text WDT predated DT 9 - 11 attacks on America by several months , and provides a contextual analysis of this current condition and spreading plague of phobic deception . This work , and this SARS website , in essence , offers insight into DT broad application of a JJ form of institutionalizedÊ "" bioterrorism "" consistent with NN sponsored biological warfare . Saddam Hussein is VBN to have exposed populations in his and adjacent lands with biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction . These advancing infectious NN attacks in North America are sanctioned by JJ - pharmaceutical and allied military industrialists . PRP complement DT JJ "" War on Terrorism , "" and bioterror - influenced culture , as additionally profitable , population - controlling , threats . Perceiving Harsh Reality Versus Generally Promoted Myths What lay persons view as ever increasing madness in DT NN around them , is eerily consistent with earlier globalist NN tank recommendations for DT development and deployment , in DT JJ millennium , of "" conflicts short of war , "" and "" JJ substitutes for standard militarization . "" These developments were adequately detailed and referenced in Death in DT Air : Globalism , Terrorism , and Toxic Warfare ( http://www.healthyworlddistributing.com/detail.aspx?ID=3). As compared with DT first and second NN wars , these smaller , more manageable , and better controlled conflicts , orchestrated events , and NN sponsored threats , were consistently selected options among foreign policy makers and NN officials beginning in DT late 1960s . Henry Kissinger , for instance , as National Security Advisor ( NSA ) under Richard Nixon , oversaw foreign policy while considering Third NNP population reduction "" necessities "" for DT U.S. , Britain , Germany , and other allies . This Bush nominee to direct DT 9 - 11 NN investigation , a reputed war criminal , then selected DT option to have DT Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) develop biological weapons , according to DT U.S. Congressional Record of 1975 . Among these biologicals were germs far deadlier than DT SARS agent ( thought to be a strain of NN ) . Under Kissinger 's watch as NSA , influenza and parainfluenza viruses were , for example , recombined with quick acting leukemia viruses ( acute lymphocytic leukemia ) to deliver a weapon WDT potentially spread cancer IN DT NN . ( More on this later . ) These incredible realities have been generally neglected , if not officially secreted . Weapons selections IN these continue to DT present day not simply by radical terrorist groups , but RB among a handful of military cartel industrialists WDT continue to sell weapons of mass destruction to those who can afford them . These conflicts short of major wars IN WWI and WWII , and war economy substitutes ( such as DT "" War on AIDS , "" "" War on Crime , "" "" War on Drugs , "" "" War on Terrorism , "" "" War on Cancer , "" DT environmental protection movement , and DT "" Star Wars "" Strategic Defense Initiative , all require sophisticated propaganda programs employing fear campaigns for social acceptance and popular support . These PSYOPS for command and control warfare ( C2W ) , military and behavior experts correctly advise , best support a well - defined rapidly evolving "" Revolution in Military Affairs "" ( RMA ) which is synonymous to a DT evolution into "" a form of human slavery "" in which DT captives - DT NN 's population , including PRP and your loved ones - MD not perceive this enslavement . DT RMA incorporates DT use of debilitating biological weapons and incapacitating chemicals , similar to DT toxic carcinogenic organophosphate pesticides deployed against mosquitoes in DT "" War Against DT West Nile NNP . "" These are often called "" non-lethal warfare "" agents , yet are indeed deadly . Death results slowly along with advancing mortality from such toxic exposures . Larger profits are made by allied pharmaceutical and JJ industrialists as victims of DT "" non-lethal "" exposures die slowly , commonly in expensive hospitals and long - term care facilities , from chronic debilitating diseases . Most of these ailments , including DT plethora of autoimmune diseases and newer cancers , were virtually non-existent 50 NNS ago . This fact , lone , strongly suggests a modern socio-economic and political NN . Unless PRP simply wish to believe PRP is God 's will or man 's greed WDT has brought these conditions to bear upon humanity . "" NNS are all too willing to relinquish their civil rights and personal freedoms in DT wake of such engineered frights . "" In recent decades , military NN tanks prescribed options for "" conflicts short of war "" WDT included novel population control policies and methodologies . These provided for : 1 ) DT establishment of JJ profit centers as traditional large - scale wars were phased out by DT JJ millennium . Ê Examples here include DT JJ multi-billion dollar "" homeland security "" programs WDT emerged from post - 9/11 legislation , such as those securing air travel and mail delivery . These are just two examples of myriad evolving profit centers fueled by frights and institutionalized terror campaigns ; 2 ) DT development of advanced persuasion and population control programs , with high tech methods of support , to facilitate "" a form of slavery "" in which humanity MD not realize PRP had become conditioned into relinquishing personal and social freedoms for DT mirage of NN , safety , and security . These provided other profit centers and population control options . Once habituated to modern lifestyle restrictions , such as enforced NN and travel restrictions , DT general population might become virtually "" enslaved "" with little effective resistance , widespread pharmaceutical dependence ( particularly using anti-depressant drugs ) , through DT use of PSYOPs . NN distractions and manipulations were considered essential in achieving this objective ; and 3 ) lucrative depopulation methods to be employed , including DT conditions and resources necessary for culling "" excess populations . "" SARS , when considered in light of these social and political impositions , can be clearly understood . SARS for Profit By Friday , March 28 , 2003 , senior fellow at DT Hudson Institute in Washington , Michael Fumento , published a thesis in Toronto similar to DT NN I advance here . This well regarded author of DT Myth of Heterosexual AIDS : How a Tragedy Has Been Distorted by DT NNP and Partisan Politics ( Regnery Gateway , 1990 ) provided an editorial titled "" Super - bug or Super Scare "" Ê published in DT National Post ( p. A16 . ) . This included DT following : PRP 's "" an incident of unprecedented scope and magnitude , "" according to Toronto NN officials , who warn Canadians to "" quarantine themselves , "" wear masks , and in some NNS stay home . Ontario NNP Minister Tony Clement has declared a "" NN emergency . "" DT meda have dubbed PRP DT "" mysterious killer pneumonia "" or "" super-pneumonia . "" But a bit of knowledge and perspective will kill this panic . Start with those scary tags , "" Mysterious "" in modern medicine usually means PRP have n't yet quite identified DT cause , although PRP have now done so here . What 's been officially named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) is CD or more strains of NN , commonly associated with colds . "" Killer pneumonia "" is practically a redundancy , since so JJ types of pneumonia ( EX are more than 50 ) do kill . DT real questions are : How lethal , how transmissible , and how treatable is this strain ? And DT answers leave no grounds for excitement , much less panic . Super ? At this writing , SARS appears to have killed 54 NNS out of almost 1,400 afflicted according to DT NNP NNP Organization , a death rate of less than 4 % . But since this only takes into account those ill enough to seek JJ help , DT actual ratio of deaths to infections is certainly far less . [ This is a tremendous understatement . ] In contrast , DT 1918 - 1919 NN pandemic killed approximately a third of DT 60 million afflicted . Further , virtually all of DT deaths have been in NNS with horrendous JJ care , primarily mainland NNP . In this country , three NNS have died out of 28 afflicted according to NNP Canada , but DT MD say more about Canada 's vaunted national NN - care system than about SARS . In DT NNP NNPS , 40 NNS have been hospitalized with SARS with zero deaths . Conversely , other forms of pneumonia kill more than 40,000 North Americans yearly . Transmissibility ? Each NN millions of North Americans alone contract DT NN . Compre IN with those 64 SARS NNS diagnosed thus far and , well , PRP can't compare them . Further evidence IN SARS is hard to catch is IN NN care workers and family members of victims are by far DT most likely to become afflicted . Treatability ? "" EX are few drugs and no NNS to fight this pathogen , "" CD wire service panted breathlessly . But EX are RB few drugs to fight any type of viral pneumonia , because PRP have very few antiviral medicines . . . .Ê [ Consider RB approximately 97 % of NNS naturally defended themselves successfully against this plague . What did PRP , or their immune systems do right ? Why is this rarely , if ever , mentioned or investigated by any mainstream source ? Alternatively , Mr. Fumento mentions "" Ribovirin , "" which he VBZ , "" appears to be effective against SARS . "" [ Is this another form of medically - sanctioned institutionalized bias WDT even DT well - intentioned Fumento expresses ? Consider DT fact IN SARS only existed a few weeks prior to Fumento 's editorial . In fact , DT NN had been questionably cultured from SARS patients only days before Fumento 's wrote DT above . Surely no clinical trials matching Ribovirin with SARS had ever been conducted . At best , then , this statement reflects either drug company propaganda and / or NN official speculations . ] Fumento continued : "" So why all DT fuss over this CD strain of pneumonia ? First , never ignore DT obvious : PRP does sell papers . But an added feature to this scare is DT cottage industry WDT 's grown up around so - called "" emerging infectious diseases . "" Some diseases truly fit DT bill , with AIDS DT classic example . Others , IN West Nile NNP in North America , are JJ to a given area . But EX 's fame , fortune , and big budgets in sounding DT "" emerging infection "" alarm and warning of our terrible folly in being unprepared . DT classic example is Ebola NN , . . . [ Mr. Fumento downplays DT Ebola threat here . ] Yet , PRP 'd almost swear IN every out break of Ebola is actually taking place in Toronto or NNP York . . . . . . . DT U.S. NN and various North American universities have RB seen these faux plagues as budget boosters . DT U.S. Centers for NNP Control and Prevention publishes a journal called Emerging Infectious Diseases , though in any given issue it's hard to find an illness WDT actually fits DT definition . DT U.S. Institute of Medicine just issued a report warning IN DT NNP NNPS is grossly unprepared to deal with emerging pathogens . Soothingly , however , PRP adds IN PRP 's nothing WDT an injection of tax dollars can't cure . Meanwhile , a NN WDT emerged eons ago called malaria kills up to 2.7 million NNS yearly . Another , tuberculosis , kills perhaps three million more . Both afflict North Americans , albeit at very low rates . DT big money and headlines MD be in DT so - called ' emerging diseases , ' but DT cataclysmic illnesses come from DT same old boring killers . In fact , EX MD be no fatal illness WDT will cause fewer deaths in North America this NN than SARS . "" Michael Fumento concluded by asking , and challenging PRP to consider : "" How do our priorities VB so twisted ? EX 's your mystery ? "" Favored JJ Victims of SARS and Other SCAMS in DT RMA Contrary to Mr. Fumento's well considered conclusion IN SARS boosts budgets of those who sound alarms loudest , DT mainstream NN has consistently attempted to have PRP VB otherwise . CD article in Canada 's leading financial newspaper , DT Financial Post , on March 31 , 2003 , heralds , "" SARS NN begins to take toll on JJ economy . "" With no mention of DT far larger number of NNS and industries WDT profit from such plagues , and DT fears surrounding them , reporter Jacqueline Thorpe 's editor assigned her to focus on DT airline and tourism industries WDT are "" particularly hard hit . "" She wrote : "" Businesses in Singapore have shut down , planes over Hong Kong are empty and thousands of NNS in Toronto have been forced into quarantine as a deadly pneumonia NN adds yet another strain to DT beleaguered JJ economy . While severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) MD not be as debilitating as war in Iraq , slumping stock markets or a weak U.S. labor market , PRP is already starting to take its toll on some Asian economies and DT long - suffering tourism industry . . . . In Hong Kong , where DT number of infections leapt by 60 to 530 over DT weekend and 13 NNS have died , economists at JPMorgan Chase estimate DT economy MD lose 0.2 % to 0.5 % of gross domestic product every month from DT drop in tourism and private consumption . . . . Businesses in JJ Chinese shopping districts [ in Toronto ] have reported a sharp drop in business . Dennis Yuent , a merchant in Pacific Mall in Toronto -- Ê North America 's largest shopping mall - VBD his sales have dropped by about 70 % since DT SARS scare began . "" Notice IN DT expert bankers at JPMorgan Chase , and Ms. Thorpe , failed to mention DT stunning growth in JJ / pharmaceutical / security / and law enforcement sectors , and DT increase in "" gross domestic product "" due to SARS and similar scams . In DT weeks and months following DT 9 - 11 attacks on America , I traced DT widely publicized anthrax mailings "" mystery "" to U.S. Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) commissioned biological weapons contractors with ties to Britain 's MI6 , Porton Down , DT Anglo - American pharmaceutical cartel , including DT Bayer , Hoecsht , Baxter and Merck Corporations , and ultimately to George Soros - a JJ banking and investment industrialist and chief money manager for Europe 's wealthiest oligarchy - owners of DT Genomic Institute WDT performed DT DNA sequencing on behalf of DT anthrax NN maker / British Porton Down subsidiary , Bioport . A complete expos on this topic is provided at =http://www.tetrahedron.org/articles/anthrax/anthrax NNP 's Threat and DT Anglo - American RMA PRP seems suspiciously convenient IN DT travel industry , and Asian travel in particular , MD be DT greatest victims at a NN when globalists ( i.e. , JJ industrialists including members of DT ultra- rich ) have directed military and political policies consistent with DT RMA and "" conflicts short of war "" agenda . Reducing travel helps to secure wide ranging RMA objectives . VB about PRP . Less mobile populations , and less NNS in general , are easier to control , especially with increased exposure to television while having to waste their NN at home . This is entirely consistent with DT "" Changing Images of Mankind "" advanced by Willis Harmon for Anglo - American military and business interests . DT effect of this similar to forced "" quarantine . "" Is n't this consistent with a "" form of slavery in which humanity MD not VB PRP had become enslaved ? "" NNS are all too willing to relinquish their civil rights and personal freedoms in DT wake of such engineered frights . DT passage of DT infamous "" Homeland Security Act "" in America , and its counterpart in Canada , are classic examples of this societal direction , forced legislation , and egregious manipulation . How convenient IN Asia , and NNP in particular , is VBN to be DT origin of this North American scourge at a NN when Chinese - Anglo - American relations are strained to say DT least . In DT days preceding DT emergence of DT first SARS NNS , American raced to DT Pacific Rim to impact escalating aggressions on DT Korean peninsula . Communist NNP -a "" most favored "" trading partner with America , is politically allied with several American enemies , including those VBN to possess weapons of mass destruction , including Iraq . Coincidental ? Not likely when viewing DT larger political picture involving DT Ango - American oligarchy 's RMA and instigated "" conflicts short of war . "" Ultimately , "" PRP DT NNPS "" have become DT greatest victims of this latest fright , and DT larger political agendas PRP serves . DT NN 's Role in SARS : Setting a Precedent Consider DT fact DT NN 's mainstream has been heavily influenced , if not entirely controlled , by multi-national corporate sponsors protecting and advancing DT interests of a relatively small number of JJ industrialists ( I have called "" globalists ; "" and others say DT "" ruling elite , "" or "" European oligarchy "" ) . RB recall IN DT focus of NN providers , on any given day or hour , results from intelligence agency directives , according to reputable authorities including myriad retired NN officials and intelligence officers . So ask and answer DT following intelligent questions : * Why have American military officials , beginning with Secretary of Defense William Cohen during DT NNP NNS , publicized America 's greatest vulnerability lies in DT realm of biological weapons wielded by terrorists ? Is this not a form of treason against DT NNP NNPS to relay such sensitive intelligence to potential enemies through DT mainstream press ? During DT McCarthy era , Hollywood producers were persecuted for having DT slightest liberal or Communist sympathies . What has changed to allow DT Hollywood production of "" Black Hawk Down "" to be used by Saddam Hussein and his military and intelligence commanders to educate and inspire his troops ? * Why does DT mainstream NN continue to foretell of DT expected arrival of DT "" Big NNP "" - an influenza NN WDT will produce a super - NN WDT will kill billions of NNS , IN DT "" Spanish NN "" did between 1918 - CD , while totally disregarding DT individuals , organizations , and laboratories WDT have labored to produce these weapons of mass destruction ? Even DT devastating Spanish NN NN has been , literally , unearthed for further NN and , do PRP suppose , deployment ? * Why was DT "" Spanish NN "" influenza NN called DT "" Spanish NN "" when PRP originated , by historic accounts , in Tibet in 1917 ? PRP is VBN IN Spanish newspapers were DT only ones reporting on DT great plague due to their neutrality over NNP War I politics . However , Spain was as dear to America then as Communist NNP is to DT NNP NNPS today . DT "" Spanish NN "" was named such following two decades of disputes between America and Spain over colonization of DT Caribbean Islands , Hawaii and DT Phillippines beginning with DT Spanish American war WDT ended in DT Phillippines in 1902 . Does this history appear to be repeating with DT advent of SARS , allegedly from NNP ? * If DT legions of recognized authorities herald DT coming of DT "" Big NN , "" why do DT same persons disregard this author 's publication of U.S. NNP , National Institutes of NNP , and National Cancer Institute documents showing IN DT U.S. Army 's 6th top biological weapons contractor in 1969 - 1970 prepared mutants of influenza and para - influenza viruses recombined with acute lymphocytic leukemia viruses ? In other words , how MD PRP VB to have a strain of DT NN WDT spreads cancer by sneezing ? Can PRP even rationalize DT develop of such a NN - lymphocytic leukemia WDT kills most victims in just a few weeks following airborne transmission ? These have been shown clearly on page 452 of DT national bestselling book , Emerging Viruses : AIDS & Ebola - Nature , Accident or Intentional ? http://www.healthyworlddistributing.com/detail.aspx?ID=4) in circulation since 1996 . A copy of this "" menu "" of infectious agents , potential biological weapons , listing several mutant recombinants involving NN viruses is posted below for your inspection . Why have n't PRP previously heard about these developments ? Especially since these documents have been extensively circulated throughout newsrooms and NN offices , particularly those engaged in JJ NN , since 1996 ? Finally , how , if I published this information , and definitive documentation , and sent this critical intelligence along with urgent pleas to approximately 8,500 members of DT mainstream NN ( as I have done this week and on dozens of previous occasions for DT past seven NNS ) can PRP turn on your television sets and gain nothing but DT "" same old song ? "" If PRP have considered and answered DT above questions , does n't PRP make sense IN America is being manipulated , if not targeted , for DT purpose of advancing a JJ population reduction agenda , if not NNP War III ? DT "" Big NNP "" is Coming DT U.S. Army 's 6th top biological weapons contractor in 1969 - 1970 prepared mutants of influenza and para - influenza viruses recombined with acute lymphocytic leukemia viruses . In other words , how MD PRP VB to have a strain of DT NN WDT spreads quick killing cancer by sneezing ? According to most emerging NN experts and NN NN officials DT ' Big CD "" might arrive at any NN . Emma Ross of DT Associated Press reported on SARS as DT NNP NNP Organization ( WHO ) launched its "" crisis plan to attack "" DT Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome . WHO , as PRP MD recall , is a U.N. sponsored organization WDT is rumored to have helped spread AIDS to Africa by way of contaminated hepatitis B and / or polio vaccinations . EX is a reasonable amount of evidence to support this contention . More disconcerting , DT U.N. is known to be heavily influenced by Rockefeller family members and corporate interests . History shows Rockefeller fortunes built DT U.N. building in NNP York City . During WWII , DT Rockefeller family and their Standard Oil Company supported Hitler more than PRP did DT allies according to court records . CD federal judge ruled Rockefeller committed "" treason "" against DT NNP NNPS . Ê Following WWII , according to attorney John Loftus - an official Nazi war crimes investigator - Nelson Rockefeller persuaded DT U.N. 's South American voting block to favor Israel 's creation only to assure secrecy regarding his support for DT Nazis . Earlier DT century , John D. Rockefeller joined Prescott Bush and DT British Royal Family in sponsoring DT eugenics initiatives WDT gave rise to Hitler 's racial hygiene programs . During DT same period DT Rockefeller family virtually monopolized American medicine , American pharmaceutics and DT cancer and genetics industries . Today , DT Rockefeller family , foundation , U.N. and WHO remain at DT forefront of administering "" population programs "" designed to reduce NN populations to more manageable levels . As per a recent advertisement Foreign Affairs - a prestigious political periodical published by DT David Rockefeller directed Council on Foreign Relations - DT U.S. population is being targeted for a 50 % reduction . "" PRP 've never faced anything on this scale with such a JJ reach , ' "" VBD Dr. David Heymann , of DT WHO , regarding SARS . "" This is DT first NN IN a JJ network of laboratories are sharing information , samples , blood , pictures , "" added Dr. Klaus Stohr , a WHO virologist coordinating labs internationally . "" Basically overnight , EX are no secrets , EX is no jealousy , EX is no competition in DT face of a JJ NN emergency . This is a phenomenal network . In CD week , DT Associated Press reported , DT WHO 's lab network had "" isolated DT SARS NN , produced a preliminary diagnostic test , and narrowed DT NN ' identity down to two candidates - neither CD a JJ strain of influenza . In DT following week , various antiviral drugs were tested as possible treatments . "" Meanwhile , doctors were RB sharing information . . . . WHO coordinated exchanges of symptoms , case histories and possible treatments . . . . Asian doctors talked about various therapies PRP were trying ; later , DT Europeans and North Americans conferred . "" In eastern Asia - at NN invitation - expert field teams of WHO staffers and NNS from international institutes were sent to Vietnam , Hong Kong and NNP to figure out how DT NN was spread , to help treat patients and advise how to control PRP . "" Aileen Plant , an infectious NN epidemiologist from Curtin University in Australia , led a dozen experts in Hanoi , CD of DT hard - hit areas . Her international team focused on DT Hanoi French Hospital , which closed its doors to JJ patients and quarantined those inside . JJ of DT sick were doctors and nurses . . . . "" With newly released figures from NNP , EX have been more than 1,500 NNS and slightly more than 50 deaths worldwide , including three in Canada . DT WHO believes DT NN is generally under control , but Hong Kong remains a challenge . In mainland NNP , DT picture is somewhat murky . . . . "" JJ inside DT WHO see DT SARS operation as a kind of dress rehearsal - ' good practice , ' Heymann VBD - for DT Big NNP , DT inevitable killer NN pandemic WDT experts say MD come at any NN . "" ' This is n't DT Big NNP , because I VBP PRP 's being contained . ' "" What PRP Should Do DT above information has been meticulously documented and referenced in this author 's two previous works , Emerging Viruses : AIDS & Ebola - Nature , Accident or Intentional ? and Death in DT Air : Globalism , Terrorism and Toxic Warfare . PRP begs DT question of what to do ? EX are personal and socio-political directions for a rational response . Here are my recommendations . 1 . Personally , PRP and your loved ones are encouraged to do everything in your power to lift your natural immunity to beyond DT 3rd percentile WDT is apparently necessary to prevent your death from SARS , or other more pathogenic agents . ÊÊ For instructions in this regard , I recommend learning from various alternative JJ websites , including www.healingcelebrations.com. These are dedicated to helping PRP improve your NN naturally . EX are five practical steps PRP can take WDT are detailed therein , and in my Healing Celebrations : Miraculous Recoveries Through Ancient Scripture , Natural Medicine and Modern NNP ( Tetrahedron Publishing Group , 2000 ) . These include : 1 ) detoxification , 2 ) deacidification / alkalinization , 3 ) immunity boosting , 4 ) oxygenation , and 5 ) bioelectric / energetic methods . 2 . Socially , PRP should alert your family and friends regarding these matters in an effort to prevent their victimization , NN manipulation , and continued confusion . 3 . Politically , PRP MD wish to become active in an effort to bring greater JJ attention to these appalling realities . "" PRP DT NNPS "" can make a difference in halting DT ongoing genocides being conducted under DT guises of "" JJ NN "" and "" JJ NN . "" This was recently demonstrated when our revealing light of truth illuminated DT risks and myths surrounding DT deadly smallpox NN . Grassroots publications IN Smallpox Alert , published by DT Idaho Observer , and DT affiliated website at www.allaboutsmallpox.com, created a massive backlash bringing DT entire program to an embarrassing halt . By forwarding this article and related website , www.SARSscam.com, to as JJ NNS as possible , PRP can effect DT same successful result . About DT Author Leonard G. Horowitz , D.M.D. , M.A. , M.P.H. , is an internationally known authority in DT overlapping fields of JJ NN , behavioral NN , emerging diseases , and bioterrorism . He received his doctorate in JJ dentistry from Tufts University School of Dental Medicine in 1977 , was awarded a post - doctoral fellowship in behavioral NN at DT University of Rochester , earned a Master of NNP NNP degree from Harvard University , and another Master of Arts degree in NN education from Beacon College , all before joining DT research faculty at Harvard . Dr. Horowitz is best known for his national bestselling book , Emerging Viruses : AIDS & Ebola - Nature , Accident or Intentional ? ( Tetrahedron Press , 1998 ; 1-888-508-4787 ; http://www.healthyworlddistributing.com/detail.aspx?ID=4) which recently resulted in DT NNP Stated General Accounting Office investigating DT man-made origin of AIDS theory . ( See : http://www.healingcelebrations.com/gao.htm) Dr. Horowitz 's work in DT field of NN risk awareness has prompted at least three Third NNP nations to VB their NN policies . His recent stunning testimony before DT NNP NNPS Congress ' NNP Reform Committee , literally brought DT hearing to a halt . ( See : http://www.healingcelebrations.com/Disease%20Deities%20on%20Capitol%20Hill%20Address%20Autism.htm) ÊDr . Horowitz questioned NN NN officials regarding a Centers for NNP Control and Prevention ( CDC ) secreted report showing a definitive link between DT mercury ingredient ( i.e. , Thimerosal ) , common to most vaccinations , and DT skyrocketing rates of NN and behavioral disorders affecting our NNS and DT future our nation . Incredibly , Dr. Horowitz alerted DT FBI , in writing and in person , CD week before DT first anthrax mailing was announced in DT press , IN a "" major anthrax fright "" was in DT process of unfolding WDT demanded DT FBI 's urgent attention . Needless to say PRP did not heed Dr. Horowitz 's prophetic warning . Moreover , three months before DT September 11 attacks on DT NNP Trade Center and Pentagon , Dr. Horowitz released his thirteenth book , prophetically titled Death in DT Air : Globalism , Terrorism and Toxic Warfare ( http://www.healthyworlddistributing.com/detail.aspx?ID=3),. DT book focuses on DT West Nile NNP as an act of bioterroism , and considers what and who is really behind this and other recent outbreaks . Dr. Horowitz argues IN his disclosures expose DT roots of JJ terrorism , along with DT individuals and organizations at DT heart of what he calls "" DT petrochemical - pharmaceutical cartel . "" He believes this "" multi-national corporate beast "" is in DT process of committing JJ genocide , profiting from engineered frights , and at DT same NN , most efficiently culling targeted populations considered excessive . As PRP MD have heard , Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , Chairman of DT Senate Judiciary Committee , called for an investigation into DT links between DT recent West Nile NN outbreaks and bioterrrorism .

Researchers analyzed data on 196,929 NNS born from 2000 through 2010 in DT Kaiser Permanente Northern California healthcare system after at least 24 weeks gestation . During follow - up periods ranging from two to 15 NNS , 1.6 percent of DT NNS were diagnosed with ASD . Among DT mothers of DT 1.6 percent , fewer than 1 percent had DT NN while pregnant , and about 23 percent had gotten a NN NN . Neither influenza infection nor NN during pregnancy were tied to NNS being diagnosed with ASD , DT research team reports in JAMA Pediatrics . “ Our data showed pretty convincingly IN EX was no association with influenza at any NN during pregnancy and NN in DT child , ” VBD senior author Lisa Croen , of Kaiser Permanente Northern California in Oakland . “ PRP ’re not recommending IN any changes be made to DT NN policy , ” Croen told Reuters NNP . “ PRP are encouraging women to VB vaccinated while pregnant . ” Previous studies looking at possible links between influenza during pregnancy and ASD had produced mixed results , Croen and her colleagues note in JAMA Pediatrics . And until now , PRP add , no studies had looked for links between ASD and NN NNS , which are recommended for pregnant women . NNS with ASD MD have social , communication and behavioral challenges WDT MD cause them to interact , learn and behave in ways different from most NNS , according to DT U.S. Centers for NNP Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . A second NN published in DT same journal RB found no link between NNS against influenza A ( H1N1 ) - sometimes referred to as swine flue - during pregnancy in 2009 - 2010 and complications later in life for over 60,000 Danish NNS . DT results support DT overall safety profile of DT NN , write DT researchers , who were led by Anders Hviid , of DT Statens Serum Institute in Copenhagen . PRP support DT NNP NNP Organization ’s recommendations WDT pregnant women should VB a NN NN . While DT CDC recommends IN everyone over 6 months of age receive a NN NN , PRP ’s especially important for some NNS - including pregnant women - who are more likely to experience complications from DT NN . “ DT NN in pregnancy is dangerous , ” VBD Dr. Loralei Thornburg , a high - risk pregnancy expert at DT University of Rochester NNP Center in NNP York . “ PRP VBP IN women who have DT NN do much worse and PRP VBP their babies do worse . ” Pregnant women with influenza MD be at an increased risk for premature labor and delivery , according to DT CDC . EX is RB a greater risk of birth defects in their babies . “ EX have been a lot of fears about NNS , but DT data suggest PRP are effective and do n’t increase DT risk of NN and other perinatal complications , ” VBD Thornburg , who was not involved with DT JJ studies . “ DT benefits strongly outweigh any risks or theoretical risks WDT PRP ’ve seen . ”"

Two nurses in Samoa , facing charges over DT deaths of two babies , have pleaded guilty to manslaughter . PRP had previously denied charges of negligence , manslaughter , and obstruction of justice . DT pair appeared today in DT Supreme Court for DT start of an expected two week trial , but their lawyer entered guilty pleas . CD defendant , Luse Emo Tauvale , has admitted to three charges of obstruction of justice and two of negligence and manslaughter , while Leutogi Te’o has pleaded guilty to CD charge of manslaughter . NNP Impact NNP reported on DT original story in 2018 when PRP made headline NN on TV1 in Samoa . Tala Fou brings PRP breaking NN on DT death of two young NNS both aged 1 - NN - old from DT villages of Safotu and Sasina in Savaii . Both NNS died within minutes of being vaccinated with DT MMR vacine at Safotu Hospital on Friday morning DT 6th of July . Our NN Reporter Alisa Faamaoni met with both families in Savaii today . DT parents of DT first child Marietta and Samuelu Tuisuesue of Sasina explained in detail to Tala Fou IN within three minutes of their 1 - NN - old daughter Lannacallystah Samuelu being injected with DT MMR vacine by a nurse she was dead . • CDC , check YOUR data , MMR rates are NOT declining What was so tragic about this story was IN DT parents of DT second child who died had reportedly already learned about DT first infant ’s death a couple hours earlier and declined to have their child receive DT same NN . DT mother reported IN DT nurse administered DT MMR NN against her consent , leading to DT child ’s immediate death upon receiving DT NN . DT second family from Safotu is still coming to grips with DT loss of their 1 - NN - old son Lameko Siu . DT parents Punipuao and Si’u Timua arrived at DT Safotu hospital with their son Lameko on Friday within two hours of DT death of DT first child once PRP became aware of what had happend DT mother refused to allow her son to be vaccinated . DT mother claims IN DT nurse on duty persisted and without her consent vaccinated her son administering DT MMR NN and within a minute he was dead . After DT second death , NN authorities immediately confiscated all DT remaining doses of DT MMR NN , and dismissed DT JJ staff , not only to apparently conduct an investigation , but for their own safety from an outraged NN . DT Prime Minister of Samoa , Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi , issued a statement about DT tragic events and reported IN , as a grandfather , CD of his grandsons had previously suffered something similar , an apparent NN injury WDT he survived but now can no longer talk . Death leaves a heartache no NN can heal . And I can imagine IN EX is no pain more far reaching and deeper than losing a child . My heart and prayers VBP out to DT grieving families at this most difficult NN . To DT effect , I humbly extend my deepest sympathy , condolences and pray IN comfort and peace will come to them . As a grandfather and father , I can relate to DT grief by DT families for their loss . I RB almost lost CD of my grandsons several NNS ago under similar circumstances . But with DT Grace of our Father in Heaven my grandson survived with DT proper treatment but he will never be DT same as he has lost DT ability to speak . As Prime Minister , I have called a full inquiry into DT circumstances leading up to this devastating incident which I do not take lightly . EX are already processes WDT will determine if negligence is a factor . And if so , rest assured those processes will be implemented to DT letter to ensure IN such a tragedy will not be repeated and those responsible will be made to answer . A Prime Example Why Informed Consent and Parental Rights are Important , and How Forced Vaccinations Endanger DT Lives of NNS NNS carry serious risks , and even DT U.S. Supreme Court has acknowledged these risks by stating IN NNS are “ Unavoidably unsafe . ” All across DT U.S. pro-vaccine extremists are trying to eliminate NN exemptions and parental choice for NNS . A recent bill passed in Oregon even gave dentists DT right to vaccinate NNS , as DT NN extremists push DT agenda of Big Pharma to try and vaccinate DT entire NN , regardless of whether or not some NNS are more susceptible to NN injuries than others . And in California Senator Richard Pan wants California to be DT first NN in DT U.S. to eliminate even DT JJ exemption for NNS , where physicians can best determine whether their patients should receive every NN recommended by DT CDC in DT childhood NN schedule . Pan wants DT politicians , DT NN Department of NNP NNP , to approve any JJ exemption to NNS instead of JJ doctors who provide JJ services to California NNS , and their parents . Of course when NNS die or are injured by NNS in DT NNP NNPS , EX is no NN attention and JJ outcry IN EX was in Samoa . DT ’s because DT U.S. is DT only country in DT NN WDT has given DT pharmaceutical industry immunity from legal consequences due to harm caused by NNS .

As DT pace accelerates , USA TODAY is rounding up some of DT week 's most notable NN developments . Here 's what PRP VBP about DT first U.S. candidate being tested on hundreds of volunteers , DT eight potential NNS being tracked by DT NNP NNP Organization , and DT $ 8 million WDT 's funding laboratories . First NNP NN candidate cleared by FDA for Phase 2 of testing DT first U.S. SARS - CoV - 2 trial NN has been cleared to VB into Phase 2 testing by DT Food and Drug Administration , Massachusetts - based Moderna announced Thursday . DT NN candidate ( a potential NN WDT MD be used if found safe and effective ) is called mRNA - 1273 and was first given to volunteers in Seattle on March 16 as Phase 1 testing began . FDA has completed its review of Moderna 's Investigational NNP Drug application for mRNA - 1273 , which allows PRP to now proceed to Phase 2 NN . Moderna expects such tests to begin “ shortly , ” PRP VBD in a NN release . Phase 2 testing is done with several hundred volunteers and looks to see how their immune systems respond to DT NN and whether PRP makes them immune to DT NN . Safety and side effects are RB studied . Moderna VBD PRP is finalizing DT protocol for Phase 3 NN of mRNA - 1273 . Those tests are expected to begin in early summer . Phase 3 trials involve giving a NN to large numbers of NNS to see whether PRP works , whether PRP is safe and whether PRP has unknown or rare side effects . These can range from DT thousands to DT tens of thousands of volunteers . Consider this : To find a NN NN , can PRP ethically infect NNS with a NN with no cure ? WHO is tracking 8 NNS in clinical evaluation As of Wednesday , DT NNP NNP Organization was tracking eight potential NNS for NN - CD ( called candidate NNS ) in clinical evaluation . These included four from NNP , CD from England , two from DT NNP NNPS and CD from DT European Union . DT list RB includes 100 candidate NNS in preclinical evaluation , meaning PRP are still being tested in test tubes or in animals . DT previous version of DT list , published on April 20 , included 5 candidate NNS in clinical evaluation and 71 in preclinical evaluation . NNP York - based pharmaceutical giant Pfizer on Monday began testing a NN candidate for SARS - CoV - 2 , DT NN WDT causes NN - CD . In its announcement , DT company VBD PRP went from pre-clinical studies in test tubes and animals to injecting humans with a possible NN in less than four months . DT trials , which are taking place in DT NNP NNPS , are still Phase 1 . These test whether a potential NN is safe , has side effects and produces DT desired response from DT body ’s immune system . NNS must VB through Phase 1 , 2 and 3 testing before PRP can be licensed . Each phase involves larger numbers of volunteers . Pfizer is working with German pharmaceutical company BioNTech on DT candidate NN , dubbed BNT162 . DT company first tested PRP in Germany last month on 12 healthy adults . DT companies say PRP plan to test DT candidate NN on 360 healthy volunteers in DT NNP NNPS BNT162 is a messenger RNA NN WDT instructs cells to make a specific piece of protein to match what ’s on SARS - CoV - 2 ’s spike protein . DT hope is DT protein pieces will cause DT body to create antibodies WDT will stop DT NN from being able to attach to and invade cells . NNS at Oxford University ’s Jenner Institute plan to test a candidate NN on more than 6,000 NNS by DT end of NNP . If PRP is effective and safe , PRP MD have millions of doses ready in DT fall . DT work is being done at DT university ’s Jenner Institute , named for Edward Jenner , DT 18th - century British physician who pioneered DT smallpox NN . Tests done in six rhesus macaque monkeys seemed to show DT candidate NN was protective . Now Phase 1 human tests are beginning . DT university is partnering with DT British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to move forward with manufacturing should DT candidate NN prove effective . Both have agreed to operate on a not - for - profit basis for DT duration of DT NN pandemic , with only DT costs of production and distribution being covered . Oxford University and its spin - out company Vaccitech , which jointly hold DT rights to DT technology used to develop DT candidate NN , will receive no royalties during DT pandemic , DT university VBD . In a video meeting on Monday hosted by DT European Union , NN leaders , nonprofits and celebrities pledged $ 8 billion to fund laboratories working to develop and produce a NN . DT money was for DT Access to NN - CD Tools Accelerator , or DT ACT Accelerator , a collaboration between DT NNP NNP organization and governments , nonprofits and industry worldwide . PRP was launched April 24 . PRP all pledged to work with and support DT effort . DT collaboration ’s mission statement VBD in part , “ PRP VBP IN as long as anyone is at risk from this NN , DT entire NN is at risk – every single person on DT NN needs to be protected from this NN . ’ DT NNP NNPS was among DT few NNS not taking part in DT fund - raising effort . DT three - hour event fundraising effort on Monday was something IN an old - fashioned telethon , with a leader from each country taking a few minutes on DT video call to pledge money for DT ACTS Accelerator .

Full_JJ coverage_NN and_CC live_JJ updates_NNS on_IN the_DT Coronavirus_NN","Dr. Stephen Thomas , who helped develop NN candidates for diseases such as Ebola , Zika and MERS , discusses DT challenges involved in accelerating development during a pandemic . When I served in DT U.S. Army as a physician - scientist , I was assigned to Thailand , and EX is CD patient I remember vividly . He was only about 8 NNS old , lived on a farm in DT northern part of DT country , and was in DT hospital with a serious brain infection . His infection was caused by DT Japanese encephalitis NN ( JEV ) , which he ’d caught from a mosquito . If he survived , he was destined to live his life with severe and debilitating neurologic abnormalities . Even worse – this tragedy MD have been avoided . Thailand had a safe and effective JEV NN and worked extremely hard to routinely immunize all its NNS , but this child had been missed . DT heartbreaking situation reminded me what my friend and mentor , Dr. Bruce Innis , told me as I embarked on a career in NN development , “ NNS do n’t save lives , NN saves lives . ” He should VB , Dr. Innis has helped successfully develop more than 15 NNS , including DT JEV NN licensed in DT U.S . Developing NNS is a complex process driven by DT fundamentals of biology , biomanufacturing and engineering , and innovation . NN concepts are explored , and prototypes first tested in DT lab . NNS then test DT safety of DT NN on animals and , if results are promising , clinical trials involving NNS begin . PRP can take NNS to develop a NN , and something WDT works well in DT lab MD not fare as well in NNS . PRP need to keep this long , complicated , uncertain process in mind as PRP hear NN emerge about NN candidates for DT NNP - CD pandemic . DT U.S. Food and Drug Administration reviews and decides whether a NN candidate is suitable for experimentation in humans . Although DT agency does consider DT results of animal studies , much of its review focuses on how DT NN is manufactured , and whether DT process is scalable . Manufacturing at scale ( hundreds of millions of doses ) is important because PRP is not enough to demonstrate a NN is safe and has clinical benefit , PRP need a system in place to make sure DT NN is accessible , and NNS are actually vaccinated . DT entire process can take up to ten NNS , sometimes longer , and can cost up to a billion U.S. dollars , sometimes more . Even in times of a JJ NN emergency PRP is difficult to advance a NN from concept to DT marketplace . I played key roles in developing candidate NNS for Ebola , MERS - CoV , and Zika , and despite DT human suffering caused by these diseases , despite their international focus , and despite considerable investment from governments and DT pharmaceutical industry , only CD of those NNS ( Ebola ) has been licensed . DT NNP NNP Organization ( WHO ) attempts to expedite JJ NN development efforts by facilitating coordination and communication , using tools IN their ‘ NN pipeline tracker . ’ In an unfortunate but recurring pattern , numerous NN candidates always populate DT tracker initially as outbreaks unfold and DT money flows but , invariably , developers move on and drop off as resources and interest dries up . PRP is unclear how DT WHO ’s role and influence will VB if DT U.S. severs ties and withdraws its NNS and funding from Geneva . JJ developers with promising NN candidates become permanently stalled in their development process because PRP cannot afford DT costs of required testing . Others experience significant bottlenecks when trying to access DT limited biomanufacturing facilities specialized in producing NNS suitable for human use . Even large pharmaceutical companies with generous financial coffers and in - house capabilities face sizeable opportunity costs by pursuing epidemic outbreak projects . PRP are forced to borrow staff and other resources from current projects to support JJ development teams , thereby stalling ongoing projects and DT introduction of NNS against other human diseases . Facing such programmatic headwinds , how is DT U.S. NN VBG to execute its NNP - CD NN development plan , Operation Warp Speed ? Compared to DT U.S. NN responses for Ebola , MERS , and Zika , JJ elements of DT operation are status quo , especially in DT areas of development and manufacturing . DT NNP - CD NN effort , however , looks to employ JJ approaches in DT hopes of reducing project timelines . For example , utilizing DT Department of Defense to deploy , distribute , and administer NNS MD support DT rapid immunization of sizable populations . Another JJ approach is DT expanded role of DT federal NN in DT private - JJ partnerships WDT have defined DT NNP - CD NN development space . Operation Warp Speed directs IN DT federal NN will decide on DT NN development pathways and DT pharmaceutical companies will not , “ … decide on their own protocols . ” DT successful past performance of private - JJ partnerships in NN development leave me very encouraged for DT prospect of a safe and effective NN - CD NN . My expectations are measured and cautious , however , given DT difficult realities of JJ - private coordination , risk sharing , and industry finding DT balance between meeting JJ NN needs and revenue goals . As with any ambitious and audacious plan , DT devil is in DT highly complex details . EX is no doubt DT federal NN has numerous very experienced NN developers , and PRP was my privilege to work with JJ of them during my Army career and I continue to do so today . But NN development involves numerous teams working together and requires close coordination , not only between NN agencies ( this is hard enough ) , but with Congress and DT academic and private sectors . Achieving harmony in these relationships has been difficult in DT past because DT mission scope and incentives for DT NN and DT private sector are different in JJ important ways . John Young , Pfizer ’s chief business officer , was recently quoted saying Pfizer MD not seeking NN funding ( even after PRP were selected by U.S. NN as a finalist for funding ) because their focus was speed and PRP , “ … did n't VB to … spend a month negotiating with DT U.S. NN . ” DT NN is focused on protecting DT Nation and its citizens . DT pharmaceutical industry cares greatly about JJ NN , but RB answers to shareholders . Committing millions of dollars to high - risk ventures is a daily occurrence in DT life NN industries but IN risk is carefully calculated , as is DT financial upside . In some NNS , such as with Merck ’s Ebola and GSK ’s malaria NNS , companies embark on development projects despite understanding EX will be financial losses , but these situations are DT exception . How will industry manage DT risks and costs of developing a NNP - CD NN , while relinquishing considerable developmental command and control to DT NN ? Why does PRP matter who controls DT development plan ? Because PRP determine how DT NN will ultimately be used and by whom , thereby defining DT market . If protocol designs are restricted to meet U.S. or largely Western agendas , industry MD lose out on accessing a JJ NNP - CD NN market , perhaps DT biggest NN market , - which means billions MD be left without a NN and industry MD be left without a good way to recoup its investment . EX is RB DT issue of who will own DT intellectual property ( IP ) generated during DT collaboration . IP protections are major drivers of revenue streams and recovery of research and development investments . Members of Congress are already waging war on drug and other pharmaceutical pricing and profits . More than a few members wish to RB revamp provisions in U.S. Code , IN DT Bayh - Dole Act , to limit industry ’s exclusive rights to IP developed using U.S. taxpayer dollars . DT NN MD contend , some say rightly , IN if U.S. taxpayers are paying DT development bill , DT U.S. must be guaranteed an immediate return on its investment - such as preferential NN access and / or pricing . But this concept of “ America first , ” is not playing well . Paul Hudson , DT CEO of French NN juggernaut Sanofi Pasteur , was quickly corrected by DT French NN when he implied DT U.S. MD be entitled to preferential NNP - CD NN access due to its financial investment . Heads of prominent non-governmental organizations , governments , and industry convened this spring to discuss DT topic of NN access and DT result , expressed by Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , WHO Director - General , was IN , “ NNS , NN partners , manufacturers , and DT private sector must act together and ensure IN DT fruits of NN and research can benefit everybody . ” Once a NN is available , manufacturing and distribution activities will need to be sustained and licenses and certifications maintained long after DT U.S. NN has moved on to DT next problem . These activities represent millions of dollars in expenditures every NN . DT pharmaceutical industry executes these tasks on a routine basis but without DT financial upside of JJ market access and IP rights , how will PRP be incentivized ? JJ companies jump into DT NN development pool during epidemics and pandemics because PRP is DT right thing to do for JJ NN . But few possess , or tolerate , DT required financial staying power to see DT project to completion . My experience leaves me little doubt IN developing a safe and effective NN - CD NN is feasible . DT unprecedented scope of coordination between , and among , U.S. NN agencies and industry is reassuring IN DT process can move fast , maybe even approach very fast , but DT ’s slightly slower than warp speed . Last week PRP was reported IN DT NN identified five companies PRP believes have DT highest likelihood of delivering a safe and effective NN - CD NN , including Moderna , AstraZeneca , Johnson & Johnson , Merck , and Pfizer . But numerous questions remain about how DT relationship between DT development partners will continue to be mutually beneficial long enough to not only realize DT development of a NN but to witness lives saved through NN .

DT lab data , contained in more than 9,000 pages of files WDT emerged a NN after DT Justice Department closed its inquiry and condemned DT late Army microbiologist Bruce Ivins as DT perpetrator , shows unusual levels of silicon and tin in anthrax powder from two of DT five letters . Those elements are found in compounds WDT MD be used to weaponize DT anthrax , enabling DT lethal spores to float easily so PRP MD be readily inhaled by DT intended victims , NNS say . DT existence of DT silicon - tin chemical signature offered investigators DT possibility of tracing purchases of DT more than 100 such chemical products available before DT attacks , which might have produced hard evidence against Ivins or led DT agency to DT real culprit . More at DT Real NN But DT FBI lab reports released in late February give no hint IN bureau agents tried to find DT buyers of additives such as tin-catalyzed silicone polymers . DT apparent failure of DT FBI to pursue this avenue of investigation raises DT ominous possibility IN DT killer is still on DT loose . A McClatchy analysis of DT records RB shows IN other key scientific questions were left unresolved and conflicting data was n’t sorted out when DT FBI declared Ivins DT killer shortly after his July 29 , 2008 , suicide . CD chemist at a national laboratory told McClatchy IN DT tin-silicone findings and DT contradictory data should prompt a JJ round of testing on DT anthrax powder . A senior federal law enforcement official , who was made available only on DT condition of anonymity , VBD DT FBI had ordered exhaustive tests on DT possible sources of silicon in DT anthrax and concluded IN PRP was n’t added . Instead , DT lab found IN PRP ’s common for anthrax spores to incorporate environmental silicon and oxygen into their coatings as a “ natural phenomenon ” WDT does n’t affect DT spores ’ behavior , DT official VBD . To arrive at DT position , however , DT FBI had to discount its own bulk testing results showing IN silicon composed an extraordinary 10.8 percent of a sample from a mailing to DT NNP York Post and as much as 1.8 percent of DT anthrax from a letter sent to Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont , far more than DT occasional trace contamination . Tin — not usually seen in anthrax powder at all — was measured at 0.65 percent and 0.2 percent , respectively , in those letters . An FBI spokesman declined to comment on DT presence of tin or to answer other questions about DT silicon - tin connection . Several NNS and former colleagues of Ivins argue IN he was a career biologist who probably lacked DT chemistry knowledge and skills to concoct a silicon - based additive . “ EX ’s no way IN an individual scientist can invent a JJ way of making anthrax using silicon and tin , ” VBD Stuart Jacobsen , a Texas - based analytical chemist for an electronics company who ’s closely studied DT FBI lab results . “ PRP requires an institutional effort to do this , such as at a military lab . ” Martin Hugh - Jones , a NN - renowned anthrax expert who teaches veterinary medicine at Louisiana NNP University , called PRP “ just bizarre ” IN DT labs found both tin — which can be toxic to bacteria such as anthrax during lab culturing — and silicon . “ PRP have two elements at abnormally high levels , ” Hugh - Jones VBD . “ DT reduces your probability to a very small number IN PRP ’s an accident . ” DT silicon - tin connection was n’t DT only lead left open in CD of DT biggest investigations in FBI history , an inquiry WDT took DT bureau to DT cutting edge of laboratory NN . In April , McClatchy reported IN after locking in on Ivins in 2007 , DT bureau stopped searching for a match to a unique genetic bacterial strain NNS had found in DT anthrax WDT was mailed to DT Post and to NBC NNP anchor Tom Brokaw , although a senior bureau official had characterized PRP as DT hottest clue to date . FBI officials say PRP ’s all a moot point , because PRP ’re positive PRP got DT right man in Ivins . A mentally troubled anthrax researcher at DT U.S. Army NNP Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick , Md. , Ivins overdosed on drugs not long after learning IN he ’d soon face five counts of capital murder . In ending DT inquiry last NN , DT Justice Department VBD IN a genetic fingerprint had pointed investigators to Ivins ’ lab , and gumshoe investigative techniques enabled them to compile considerable circumstantial evidence WDT demonstrated his guilt . Among these proofs , prosecutors cited Ivins ’ alleged attempt to steer investigators away from a flask of anthrax in his lab WDT genetically matched DT mailed powder — anthrax WDT had been shared with other researchers . PRP RB noted his anger over a looming congressional cut in funds for his research on a JJ anthrax NN . However , DT FBI never found hard evidence IN Ivins produced DT anthrax or IN he scrawled threatening letters seemingly meant to resemble those of Islamic terrorists . Or IN he secretly took late - night drives to Princeton , N.J. , to mail them . DT FBI declared Ivins DT killer soon after paying $ 5.8 million to settle a suit filed by another former USAMRIID researcher , Steven Hatfill , whom DT agency mistakenly had targeted earlier in its investigation . Anthrax is CD of DT deadliest and most feared biological weapons . Once inhaled , microscopic anthrax spores germinate into rapidly multiplying , highly toxic bacteria WDT attack human tissue . DT resulting illnesses are lethal within days if untreated . DT letters , mailed just weeks after DT Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , not only went to DT NNP York Post , Leahy and Brokaw , but RB to American NNP Inc. in Boca Raton , Fla. , and to Democratic then - Sen . Tom Daschle of South Dakota . Five NNS died , 17 were sickened and about 31,000 were forced to take powerful antibiotics for weeks . Crews wearing moon suits spent several weeks eradicating DT spores from a Senate office building and a central Postal Service facility in Washington . DT FBI guarded its laboratory ’s finding of 10.8 percent silicon in DT Post letter for NNS . NNP York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler asked FBI Director Robert Mueller how much silicon was in DT Post and Leahy letters at a hearing before DT House Judiciary Committee in September 2008 . DT Justice Department responded seven months later IN silicon made up 1.4 percent of DT Leahy powder ( without disclosing DT 1.8 percent reading ) and IN “ a reliable quantitative measurement was not possible ” for DT Post letter . DT bureau ’s conclusions IN silicon was absorbed naturally drew a gentle challenge in February from a panel of DT National Academy of Sciences , which evaluated DT investigation ’s lab work . While finding no evidence IN silicon had been added to DT mailed anthrax , DT panel noted deep in its report IN DT FBI had provided “ no compelling explanation ” for conflicts in silicon test results between DT Sandia National Laboratories and its own lab . Sandia — which used electron microscopes , unlike DT FBI — reported only a tenth as much silicon in DT NNP York Post letter as DT bureau ’s lab did . Sandia VBD PRP was all embedded in DT spore coatings , where PRP was n’t harmful . DT Armed Forces Institute of Pathology ran a third set of tests and found pockets of heavy silica concentrations , but PRP MD n’t say whether PRP were inside or outside DT spores . Jacobsen , DT Texas chemist , suspects IN DT silica pockets represented excess material WDT went through a chemical reaction and hardened before PRP MD penetrate DT spores . DT National Academy of Sciences panel wrote IN DT varying composition of DT powder might have accounted for DT differing findings . While finding no evidence IN silicon was added , DT panel VBD PRP “ cannot rule out DT intentional addition of a silicon - based substance … in a failed attempt to enhance dispersion ” of DT NNP York Post powder . Tufts University chemistry professor David Walt , who led DT panel ’s analysis of DT silicon issue , VBD in a phone interview IN “ EX was not enough silicon in DT spores WDT MD account for DT total silicon content of DT bulk analysis . ” He VBD PRP was unclear whether DT “ trace ” levels of tin were significant . During DT FBI ’s seven - NN hunt , DT Department of Homeland Security commissioned a team of chemists at DT Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California to grow anthrax - IN spores under varying conditions to see how much silicon MD end up naturally in DT final product . PRP found little , if any , silicon in most NNS , far less than was in DT NNP York Post letter , VBD Stephan Velsko , CD of DT two researchers . He called DT tin readings from DT FBI ’s anthrax data “ baffling . ” Peter Weber , Velsko ’s co-researcher , VBD DT academy panel ’s focus on DT conflicting data “ raises a big question , ” and “ PRP ’d be really helpful for closure of this case if DT was resolved . ” He suggested IN further “ micro-analysis ” with a highly sophisticated electron microscope MD “ pop DT question marks really quickly . ” In a chapter in a recently updated book , “ Microbial Forensics , ” Velsko wrote IN DT anthrax “ must have indeed been produced under an unusual set of conditions ” to create such high silicon counts . DT scenario , he cautioned , might not be “ consistent with DT prosecution narrative in this case . ” About 100 tin-catalyzed silicone products are on DT market , and an even wider array was available in 2000 and 2001 , before DT mailings , VBD Richie Ashburn , a vice NN of CD manufacturer , Silicones Inc. , in High Point , N.C . Mike Wilson , a chemist for another silicone products maker , SiVance , in Gainesville , Fla. , VBD IN numerous silicon products MD be used to make spores or other particles NN - repellent . He RB VBD IN DT ratios of silicon to tin found in DT Post and Leahy samples MD be “ about right ” if a tin- catalyzed silicone had been added to DT spores . Jacobsen , a Scottish - born and - educated chemist who once experimented with silicon coatings on dust particles , VBD he got interested in DT spore chemistry after hearing rumors in late 2001 IN a U.S. military facility had made DT killer potions . He called PRP “ outrageous ” IN DT scientific issues have n’t been addressed . “ America , DT most advanced country in DT NN , and DT FBI have every resource available to them , ” he VBD . “ And yet PRP have no compelling explanation for not properly analyzing DT biggest forensic clue in DT most important investigation DT FBI labs had ever gotten in their history . ” As a result of Ivins ’ death and DT unanswered scientific issues , Congress ’ investigative arm , DT NNP Accountability Office , is investigating DT FBI ’s handling of DT anthrax inquiry ."

She described how she had initially thought PRP was just a cold . But her unrelenting symptoms of coughing and ' chest rattling ' led her first to an emergency room , and then to a lung specialist . Thankfully , Oprah is better now . And thankfully , she received excellent care , including close monitoring , antibiotics , and likely inhalers as well . In her chat with Ellen , she voices DT importance of getting NN shots and pneumonia shots . For those of PRP in healthcare , this is not radically JJ information . PRP are just entering this NN 's NN season , already having seen at least CD child die from DT NN . DT NN shot is recommended to all NNS ages 6 months and older . Every NN . Period . But what about DT pneumonia shot ? DT NN does n't usually make PRP to DT headlines . Until Oprah had pneumonia , DT is . DT pneumonia NN is not actually a NN WDT prevents pneumonia per se , as pneumonia can be caused by a multitude of viruses and bacteria . But PRP does prevent infection from 13 to 23 types of DT bacteria pneumococcus , a powerful organism WDT can knock anybody for a loop . DT PCV13 ( pneumococcal conjugate NN 13 ) is recommended to infants and NNS , and adults ages 65 NNS and older ; DT PCV23 ( pneumococcal conjugate NN 23 ) is recommended to NNS ages two NNS and older , and adults ages 65 and over who are at risk for pneumonia , or have a chronic illness . Oprah just turned 65 this past January .

Childhood diseases WDT were commonplace less than a generation ago are now increasingly rare because of NNS . In order to be effective at eliminating communicable diseases , NNS must be administered to sufficient levels of persons in DT community . Because of this , JJ NN officials have mandated NN for certain diseases as a condition to school attendance . DT overwhelming effectiveness of NN programs MD lead individuals to ignore DT benefits of NN and focus more on DT risk of side effects . Moreover , some have criticized DT coercive nature of these programs . These objections MD lead to an unacceptably high number of exemptions , which can compromise NN programs and leave DT population susceptible to outbreaks . This paper explores NN programs with an eye toward greater JJ safety without ignoring DT reality of a small but committed group of NN critics . DT paper begins with a discussion of DT historical development of mandatory NN policies and DT issues posed by exemptions . PRP then addresses some of these issues in DT context of NN safety . PRP RB seeks solution by framing DT discussion in JJ terms . PRP concludes by recommending stricter enforcement of mandatory requirements for most NNS and greater dissemination of information on DT continued importance of NN ."

I VBP DT feeling of thinking others were just plain crazy and wrong for not vaccinating their NNS and themselves . ‘ Irresponsible ! ’ I VBD when pointing my finger . I ’d use DT same old arguments about polio and small pox and how NNS saved PRP from all those horrible diseases and just swallowing and regurgitating DT propaganda I was brought up with . PRP was only recently , in 2009 IN I started questioning my long held beliefs and began digging in to DT history , efficacy and safety of NNS . I was appalled at what I found and DT recklessness of those NN NN agencies entrusted with our NN and our NNS ’s safety , and angry with myself IN I had put my family ’s NN at risk by blind faith in others when I was ultimately responsible for DT JJ decisions of my family . When I began to put this article together I specifically chose not to include research from or links to websites WDT are considered untrustworthy by most pro-vaxxers , sites such as Natural NNP , Mercola , etc. even though I personally trust those sites and much more than I MD WebMd and for good reason [ a ] . Instead I chose to employ basic logic and RB incorporate independent and .gov scientific studies - mostly peer review , journals , NN from mainstream sources ( IN pro-vaxxers love and totally trust ) and articles WDT link to other .gov scientific studies , as well as NN statistical resources . So , I started writing down questions and then looking for answers . I ’ll admit , some of these questions have already been asked by others , but I just expanded upon PRP to form a helpful list . I hope DT following information helps PRP in your lifelong journey in search of NN , vitality and truth in your own lives and your NNS ’s lives . 1 . Why are newborn babies vaccinated on their first day of life against a NN WDT is primarily transmitted sexually and by needles in drug users ? ( Pregnant women are already tested for STD ’s prior to birth so EX ’s no reason to give PRP to an infant ) . Interesting to note , of DT few NNS WDT still are given to infants and STILL has thimerasol in PRP is Hep B and DipTet ( and NN shot recommended to pregnant women ) . So , DT claim IN PRP has been removed from all NNS is a lie and misdirection . If PRP give PRP to all newborns then ALL DT newborns are getting DT thimerasol ( mercury derivative ) . “ PRP was removed from JJ child NNS in 2002 but remains in some NNS ( e.g. , hepatitis B NN and ) ” Page 21 . 2 . Why are babies given NNS to produce antibodies when PRP do not produce antibodies until after DT age of 3 to 6 months ? PRP VBP DT required antibodies from breastfeeding . 3 . Why does DT NN tell parents to delay breast feeding and VB more NNS when breast feeding babies produce higher levels of antibodies ? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov… http://naturalsociety.com… 4 . Why are n’t NN manufacturers held responsible when their product injures your child ? Why MD these companies need to be protected from DT effects of such wonderful products ? ( Look into NN Injury Compensation Program .gov and VAERS ) DT Supreme Court ruling exempting DT NN manufacturers from all liability is done under DT explicit understanding IN PRP fall under DT category “ unavoidably unsafe products . ” http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-152.pdf http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/index.html https://vaers.hhs.gov/index 5 . Why have no double blind , placebo , randomized controlled trials been done on any NNS ? This is standard with any other drug . 6 . Why are PRP following DT NNP NN schedule ? PRP are DT most vaccinated population on DT NN with DT highest rates of infant deaths / SIDS in DT western NN ? http://www.washingtonpost.com… http://sm.stanford.edu/archive/stanmed/2013fall/article2.html 7 . Why are NN outbreaks occurring in populations with 90 % + NN rates ? What about DT ‘ Herd Immunity ’ guys ? http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/139/1/77.short http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8483623 http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/6/5/00-0512 8 . Why are NNS vaccinated against these diseases still catching and spreading them ? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24076325 http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com…(see Johns Hopkins paper ) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15954490 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8483623 9 . Why are PRP frightened of non-fatal illnesses WDT train a child ’s immune system how to behave ? 10 . Why are NN manufacturers allowed to reduce antigens and insert cheap and toxic additives WDT aggravate DT injection site ? 11 . Why do PRP need multi- dose NNS if DT number CD priority of NN manufacturers is your child ’s safety ? 12 . Why will no physician sign a written guarantee for a child ’s safety prior to vaccinating them with products PRP insist PRP take and WDT PRP say are completely safe ? 13 . Why is EX no outrage about DT 3.1 billion dollars paid out in NN injury / death claims and yet PRP claim EX is no correlation and PRP are perfectly safe ? http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statisticsreport.pdf 14 . Why do n’t NNS recognize from history IN DT most widespread and lethal diseases in DT last 200 NNS were reduced due to cleaner drinking NN , improved sanitation , nutrition , less overcrowded areas and better living conditions ? NNS were introduced at points in NN where every single NN was already declining , most almost completely gone . To give NNS credit for JJ reductions in NN is IN giving a band - aid credit for healing a wound WDT was already closing . Dr. Hans Rosling shows exactly how DT NN condition of nearly all NNS of DT NN have improved with wealth , even 200 NNS ago , at DT times where EX no NNS . http://youtu.be/jbkSRLYSojo https://childhealthsafety.wordpress.com/graphs/ ( blog yes , but DT links are amazing and historical data . ) http://www.columbia.edu… By DT late 1950s , even before DT introduction of measles NN , measles - related deaths and case fatality rates in DT NNP NNPS had decreased markedly , presumably as a result of improvement in NN care and nutrition ( Oxford Journal of Infectious Diseases ) . 15 . Why do NNS keep parroting what PRP hear about ‘ Herd Immunity ? ’ Herd immunity is a hilarious concept WDT assumes IN 1 ) Vaccinated NNS are immune to DT diseases for which PRP ’ve been vaccinated , 2 ) Can not carry DT diseases for which PRP are vaccinated / immune , 3 ) Because most of DT NNS are vaccinated , other NNS around them ca n’t catch DT NN . My favourite analogy for herd immunity is IN if 95 % of NNS in a building are wearing hard hats when DT ceiling falls in , DT 5 % are protected . ( credit Dr. Robert Murdoch ) 16 . Why are almost all pro-vaxxer adults PRP talk to not up to date on their adult vaccinations / boosters ? 18 . Why did n’t our NN NN agencies ever safety test thimerasol ( a mercury derivative and adjuvant ) since Lilly developed PRP in DT 1920’s ? PRP used PRP in NNS from 1930 to 2004 ! PRP still is in some NNS such as DT NN NN and others . Here is a 2 minute clip , from Congressional Hearings . DT EPA themselves acknowledge DT toxic effects of mercury : http://www.epa.gov/hg/effects.htm http://www.nytimes.com… http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21350943 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20803069 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21549155 CD . Why is PRP IN only 40 % of NN professionals receive DT NN shot each NN ? PRP must not believe in PRP . http://abcnews.go.com… 20 . Why ? Instead of a mandatory NN law , why do n’t PRP have a mandatory law passed to protect PRP from Iatrogenic Death ? ( Death by Doctor , 3rd leading cause of death ! ) http://articles.mercola.com… http://www.worldlawdirect.com… 21 . Why does n’t DT pro NN NN admit IN DT vaccinated spread NN and stop blaming PRP ? http://www.cnbc.com/id/102473744 http://www.nc.cdc.gov/eid/article/6/5/00-0512 22 . Why do NNS still trust their NN NN agencies when PRP say NNS are perfectly safe ? With all DT big pharma fraud NNS , Merck , Glaxo Smith Kline , etc. and all DT class action suits WDT come out several times a NN for death / injury PRP see on tv commercials every week , combine DT with DT VICP and VAERS .gov statistics , and Iatrogenic Death statistics , why do NNS still trust their NN NN agencies when PRP say NNS are perfectly safe ? Having VBN DT , why is NN trusted at all since Democide statistics ( death by NN ) show IN nearly 300 million in this last century were killed by DT NN . Those are non-combatants . Here are a few more studies : – Abnormal measles - mumps - rubella antibodies and CNS autoimmunity in NNS with NN . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12145534 – Serological association of measles NN and human herpes NN - 6 with brain auto - antibodies in NN . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9756729 This NN is DT first to report an association between NN serology and brain auto antibody in NN ; PRP supports DT hypothesis IN a NN - induced autoimmune response MD play a causal role in NN . – Effects of diphtheria - tetanus - pertussis or tetanus NN on allergies and allergy - related respiratory symptoms among NNS and adolescents in DT NNP NNPS . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10714532 Review is made of 107 NNS of neurological complications of pertussis inoculation reported in DT literature . DT early onset of neurological symptoms was characteristic , with changes of consciousness and convulsions as DT most striking features . DT question of aetiology is considered and contraindications are discussed …as is DT grave danger of further inoculations when a previous NN has produced any suggestion of a neurological reaction . Aluminum Studies : – Do aluminum NN adjuvants contribute to DT rising prevalence ofautism ? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22099159 “ … A second series of experiments was conducted on mice injected with six doses of aluminum hydroxide . Behavioural analyses in these mice revealed significant impairments in a number of motor functions as well as diminished spatial memory capacity . ” Experimental research , clearly shows IN aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans .

Information extracted from studies indicates IN : ( a ) activity of low doses of Thimerosal against isolated human and animal brain cells was found in all studies and is consistent with Hg neurotoxicity ; ( b ) DT neurotoxic effect of ethylmercury has not been studied with co-occurring adjuvant - Al in TCVs ; ( c ) animal studies have shown IN exposure to Thimerosal - Hg can lead to accumulation of inorganic Hg in brain , and IN ( d ) doses relevant to TCV exposure possess DT potential to affect human neuro - development . – Neonatal administration of thimerosal causes persistent changes in mu opioid receptors in DT rat brain . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20803069 – Persistent behavioural impairments and alterations of brain dopaminesystem after early postnatal administration of thimerosal in rats . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21549155 – Maternal Thimerosal Exposure Results in Aberrant Cerebellar Oxidative Stress , Thyroid Hormone Metabolism , and Motor Behaviour in Rat Pups ; Sex - and Strain - Dependent Effects . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22015705 – Administration of thimerosal to infant rats increases overflow of glutamate and aspartate in DT prefrontal cortex : protective role ofdehydroepiandrosterone sulfate . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22015977 Thimerosal , a mercury - containing NN preservative , is a suspected factor in DT etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders . PRP previously showed IN its administration to infant rats causes behavioral , neurochemical and neuropathological abnormalities similar to those present in NN . DT ACIP ’s recommendation of influenza NN during pregnancy is not supported by citations in its own policy paper or in current JJ literature . Considering DT potential risks of maternal and fetal mercury exposure , DT administration of thimerosal during pregnancy is both unjustified and unwise .

As much as was required after 9/11 ? Less ? More ? Considering some of DT changes already happening and DT JJ more recommended before airports can reopen safely to commercial routes , experts are referring to DT NN pandemic as ‘ DT JJ terrorism , ’ triggering DT biggest crisis DT airline industry has ever faced . Let ’s start with DT entire process of checking in for flights , which some calculate MD take up to four hours and involve social distancing , sanitation of passengers and luggage , wider spaces for various lines and waiting to board . Nine out of 10 experts expect slower turnarounds between flights due to DT need of thorough cleaning of cabins and following of sanitary measures at airports . In DT short run , though , PRP ’s expected IN reduced passenger numbers and airlines traveling to a smaller pool of destinations MD reduce delays . • None American Airlines workers bring class action saying material in JJ gray uniforms made them sick • None DT Brave NNP NNP of Bill Gates and Big Telecom ” by Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. and Dafna Tachover What PRP Can Expect Among DT steps under consideration : no cabin bags , no lounges , no automatic upgrades , face masks , surgical gloves , self - check - in , self - bag - drop - off , immunity passports , on - DT - spot blood tests and sanitation disinfection tunnels . Digital technologies and automation will play a critical role in DT future of air travel . DT need to reduce “ touchpoints ” at airports implies mandatory use of biometric boarding WDT allows passengers to board planes with only their face as a passport . A number of airlines including British Airways , Qantas and EasyJet already are using DT technology . According to DT NNP Travel and Tourism Council ( WTTC ) , “ DT ‘ JJ normal ’ at major airports , such as Heathrow , JFK and Singapore Changi will include almost exclusive use of online check - ins , and contactless payments . Then EX are DT radical changes DT airports will have to make starting most probably with stopping non-fliers from entering at all except for unaccompanied minors or others who need assistance . PRP will need more extensive all - biometric check - in systems and efficient DYI for dropping off bags , ‘ travel bubbles , ’ or tunnels for disinfection . ( After being checked in , luggage MD RB be put through a disinfection fogging tunnel . ) PRP RB must install demarcation of DT spaces for social distancing in corridors and concourses , larger spaces for queues and waiting , plexiglass or other protective barriers at customer service counters , hand sanitation stations and thermal scanning to check crowds for fever - grade body temperatures , which already are in use in some major airports . • None Bill Gates ’ Philanthropy : 30,000 Indian girls used as guinea pigs to test cancer NN “ Only those ‘ fit to fly ’ will be allowed to enter , ” predicts DT airline strategy firm SimpliFlying , in a recent report , where PRP identifies more than 70 different areas in DT passenger journey WDT “ are expected to either VB or to be introduced from scratch , including having bags ‘ sanitagged ’ after VBG through fogging , electrostatic or UV - disinfection to restore confidence in flying after NNP - CD . ” DT Telegraph explains IN “ PRP MD sound futuristic , but UV sanitation is likely to become commonplace at DT NN ’s airports . London Heathrow says PRP is to begin trialling DT process for its security trays . ” And then comes boarding DT boarding process is expected RB to become ‘ touchless , ’ with options including facial recognition , already used in some U.S. airports for international flights . On DT planes , EX will be blocked seats , electrostatic spraying , personnel in protective gear and , of course , masks . Major European carriers such as Air France and KLM already have made them compulsory and PRP ’s expected IN all other airlines will do DT same . As for food , DT tendency is to stop serving altogether on short - haul flights , while DT airlines consider ‘ light refreshments ’ for long - haul flights . Hong Kong Airlines has decided to stop offering food altogether . At DT arrival point , SimpliFlying forecasts , international passengers will need to show some type of immunity document / passport , RB advocated by DT International Air Transport Association , IATA , to border control agents . Once a NN has been found , DT MD shift to a proof of NN . “ Arriving passengers will RB undergo another temperature screening at their final destination and potentially even blood tests for NNP - CD , ” Conde Nast predicts . “ Some airports IN Hong Kong and Vienna are testing passengers for DT NN with a blood test before PRP are allowed to enter DT country . Those types of tests , however , might be short - lived . ” Thermal testing is RB recommended by IATA , “ while Airlines UK , which represents British Airways , EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic , has VBN ‘ pre- screening ’ of travelers should be introduced ideally as early in DT passenger journey as possible , ” reports DT Telegraph . Although EX are no standard decisions about making such tests and screening mandatory , airports and airlines are pushing for uniform regulations . PRP ’s not clear who will be responsible for checking travelers ’ temperatures and other NNP - CD symptoms , for example . SimpliFlying predicts IN a JJ federal NN agency likely will be created to coordinate NN screenings inside airports . As immediately following 9/11 , a process of trial - and - error is likely , with JJ airports and airlines following what some ‘ pioneers ’ establish . “ EX will be JJ protocols for check - in involving digital technology ; hand sanitizer stations at frequent points including where luggage is stored ; contactless payment instead of cash ; using stairs more often than lifts where DT two - meter - rule can be harder to maintain ; and fitness equipment being moved for greater separation , among other examples , ” DT WTTC wrote in a recent report . DT international institution says IN DT sector will face a gradual return to travel over DT coming months as a “ JJ normal ” emerges before a NN becomes available on a mass scale , large enough to inoculate billions of NNS . Travel is likely to return first to domestic markets with “ staycations , ” then to a country ’s nearest neighbors before expanding across regions , and then finally across continents to welcome DT return of journeys to long - haul international destinations . WTTC believes IN younger travelers in DT 18 - 35 age group , who appear to be less vulnerable to NNP - CD , RB MD be among DT first to begin traveling again . According to Gloria Guevara , WTTC NN & CEO , traveling in DT ‘ JJ normal ’ age requires coordinated actions , including JJ standards and protocols , “ for a safe and responsible road to recovery for DT JJ Travel & Tourism sector as consumers start planning trips again . ” DT JJ protocols and standards are being defined following feedback from associations representing DT different travel sectors including International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) , DT Airport Council International ( ACI ) , Cruise Lines International Association ( CLIA ) , NNP NNPS Travel Association ( USTA ) , Pacific Asia Travel Association ( PATA ) , International Civil Aviation Organisation ( ICAO ) , DT Organisation for NNP Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , DT European Travel Commission ( ETC ) and DT NNP Tourism Organisation ( UNWTO ) . But with protocols and standards , biometric systems , immunity passports and DT best intentions for a safe road to recovery , DT future of traveling , as NNP York Times ’s Niraj Chokshi explains , is still bleak : “ With much of DT NN closed for business , and no widely available NN in sight , PRP MD be months , if not NNS , before airlines operate as JJ flights as PRP did before DT crisis . Even when NNS start flying again , DT industry MD be transformed , much as PRP was after DT Sept. 11 terrorist attacks . ” And in DT process , as PRP is already DT case , some airlines , especially smaller ones , will be push into bankruptcy or become takeover targets . “ Consumer fears about catching DT NN on crowded planes MD lead to reconfigured seating . Carriers MD initially entice wary travelers with discounts , but if PRP can’t fill up flights , PRP MD resort to raising ticket prices . ” For Dave CalhounIn , CEO of Boeing , not only are DT smaller airlines in danger . He thinks IN at least a major U.S carrier will “ most likely ” VB out of business due to DT NN pandemic . In an interview with NBC NNP ’ TODAY , on Tuesday he told Savannah Guthrie : “ … something will happen when September comes around . Traffic levels will not be back to 100 % . PRP wo n’t even be back to 25 % . Maybe by DT end of DT NN PRP approach 50 % . So EX will definitely be adjustments WDT have to be made on DT part of DT airlines . ” Copyright 2020 – permission to reprint fully granted , WITH links to original story"

Both sons were conceived with sperm from DT same donor , and Rizzo was shocked to discover IN other mothers who used DT same donor RB had sons with NN , DT Post reported . Rizzo was told IN DT likelihood of all these related NNS having NN by chance was IN all DT mothers "" opening up a dictionary and pointing to DT same letter of DT same word on DT same page at DT same NN , "" she told DT Post . DT means a mutation in DT donor 's sperm was likely responsible . But is EX a single "" NN gene ? "" In short , no : EX are hundreds of genetic variations tied to NN spectrum disorder , according to DT . In most NNS , these mutations increase a person 's risk of NN , but PRP do n't destine someone to develop DT condition . In other words , genes typically play only a partial role in DT risk of developing NN , with environmental factors , such as DT parents ' ages and birth complications , contributing as well . But in rare NNS , genetic mutations are thought to be DT main cause of NN . Only about 2 % to 4 % of NNS with NN have these mutations , according to DT NIH . "" PRP call NN CD thing , but PRP 's different in every person . In some , PRP 's all about DT genes . Some PRP 's a combination of genes and DT environment . Some NNS , PRP 's unknown , "" Dr. Wendy Chung , a professor of pediatric medicine at Columbia University , told DT Post . Studies of Rizzo's NNS found IN PRP had two mutations tied to NN in genes called MBD1 and SHANK1 . Most reproductive clinics test for several hundred genetic conditions , but EX is no test for NN , DT Post reported . In Rizzo 's lawsuit , she alleged IN DT donor 's profile had false information . For example , she VBD IN DT donor did not have a college degree , as DT profile listed , and IN he had been , which was omitted from DT profile , DT Post reported .

Learn_VB more_JJR about_IN sponsor_NN -_HYPH generated_VBN content_NN ._.","DT NN is in a race to develop NNS against DT novel NN SARS - CoV - 2 and DT NN PRP causes , NNP - CD . PRP are determined to defeat this NN , which continues to infect millions of NNS and cause death and suffering around DT NN . Given DT urgent crisis , PRP ’s clear IN a NN cannot be developed soon enough to help stem DT pandemic . With DT goal of accomplishing what in normal times MD have been deemed impossible , PRP are engaging collaboratively with regulatory authorities to adapt traditional NN research and development to meet this unprecedented challenge . With our partner BioNTech , a German biotech company , PRP are developing not CD but at least four different NN candidates all at once . PRP began testing DT NN in Germany on April 23 . This week , PRP ’re starting to test our mRNA NN candidates in a U.S. trial — only six weeks after kicking off our NN - CD partnership . Never in my over 25 NNS of developing NNS have I seen a clinical trial launched at this speed . Usually , PRP takes NNS of dedicated research to VB to this point . This record milestone is a testament to DT innovation and collaboration among researchers and colleagues from two very different organizations and cultures , unprecedented access to advice and support from regulatory agencies and other NN agencies , and DT willingness of companies to VB above and beyond what is “ normal ” for them . Our approach is based on DT same technology WDT PRP are developing in another partnership with BioNTech — an mRNA seasonal influenza NN , which has not yet entered clinical studies . If successful , DT NN MD potentially transform DT yearly “ scramble ” of producing a NN NN by increasing DT speed of development and coverage of circulating strains . PRP saw DT opportunity to pursue a collaboration with BioNTech on DT same platform technology for NN - CD , which MD potentially help PRP develop a NN faster than using traditional approaches . Unlike JJ conventional NNS — which usually take months to NNS of research because PRP entail first developing biological cell , NN or bacterial production processes — mRNA NNS are fully synthetic , well characterized and use nearly identical processes for purification . If DT NN platform is proven to work , PRP MD allow PRP to quickly adapt DT platform to other pathogens by exchanging DT small portion of DT SARS - CoV - 2 genetic code for DT of another pathogen . In most conventional viral NNS used today , weakened or killed forms of a NN , or protein components of DT pathogen known as antigens , are administered to a person . DT immune system then recognizes these foreign NN components and unleashes a multipronged defense : special immune cells to kill infected cells and specific antibodies to prevent DT NN from infecting our cells . Then , if a vaccinated person encounters DT NN in DT future , their immune system already knows how to recognize , respond and defeat PRP before PRP become sick . DT mRNA NN technology does not require DT lengthy production of weakened or killed viruses or DT viral antigen . Instead , mRNA , a set of genetic instructions coding for viral antigens , is injected into DT body . Once inside cells , these instructions guide DT cell ’s machinery to produce DT antigens , which can then teach DT immune system how to recognize and fight off a future NN attack . In addition , RNA platforms can RB “ help ” DT immune system mount a stronger response to an antigen than DT induced by DT antigen alone . DT genetic material RNA can be seen by DT immune system as “ viral . ” DT launches a potent arm of DT immune system called innate immunity , which recognizes patterns of common pathogens such as viruses and bacteria and increases DT potency of DT NN . Clinical trials at pandemic speed NN clinical trials are typically run with only CD NN candidate in three separate phases , moving from small safety and immunogenicity studies then scaling up to large efficacy trials WDT usually involve tens of thousands of participants . PRP ’s a deliberative and sequential process WDT can take JJ NNS . Due to DT urgency of DT pandemic , well - established clinical development paths MD take too long for PRP . To shorten DT NN from preclinical to clinical evaluation , PRP are using a unique approach to test at least four different RNA NN candidates in parallel in a smaller number of clinical trial participants . DT ongoing U.S. phase 1 / 2 NN uses a JJ trial design WDT maximizes development speed while ensuring safety by quickly eliminating suboptimal NN candidates for DT benefit of DT “ winner ” in DT race . Instead of using sequential individual trials , PRP plan to adapt DT same phase 1 / 2 trial in real NN and based on continuous data collection to select DT final NN candidate , ensure safety and tolerability and collect functional immunogenicity data to inform DT seamless transition into DT clinical efficacy stage of DT NN . Given this design , PRP are shaving JJ NNS from DT NN development timeline , and assuming success , PRP ’ll potentially be able to roll out a promising NN candidate as early as fall 2020 . Early NN clinical trials are typically done exclusively in younger populations first and then tested in older populations . PRP are RB changing this model : After determining DT safety of each candidate ’s dose level in younger populations , PRP will then immediately test DT dose level in older adults , so IN necessary safety and immunogenicity data for DT population most vulnerable to NNP - CD are available almost at DT same NN to begin DT efficacy stage of DT trial . DT war against DT NN DT other critical aspect of creating a successful NN is ensuring IN PRP can manufacture and distribute hundreds of millions of doses . Again PRP have changed DT typical development approach . Under normal circumstances , DT investment of JJ hundreds of millions to billions of dollars is needed to build NN production capacity . These investments occur only after a NN candidate has proven itself to be safe and immunogenic . Today PRP are compressing a process WDT usually takes NNS to CD WDT MD take only several months , with huge upfront investments of capital and resources before PRP have clinical evidence WDT DT NN candidate MD be successful . To DT end , PRP are working together with BioNTech and Pfizer ’s manufacturing teams to quickly scale up infrastructure and try to eliminate any potential bottlenecks in sourcing DT materials needed to produce hundreds of millions of NN doses in record NN . I ’ve dedicated my scientific career to creating and developing NNS so IN vulnerable populations all over DT globe can be protected from NN and death . I have witnessed firsthand DT tremendous power of NNS to VB lives and help ensure IN NNS have a fighting chance to grow up healthy . NN R&D has always been challenging , but EX is normally sufficient NN to solve scientific problems during development . DT current crisis has turned our NN upside down as NN is DT CD thing PRP do not have . PRP are all energized and inspired to offer potential solutions with an unprecedented sense of urgency to make what seemed impossible only a couple of months ago now possible . DT ongoing experience has fortified my belief in DT power of NN , researchers , NN care professionals and others working closely to address DT pandemic . This NN is our enemy . And PRP need to do everything in our power to win DT war against PRP , not tomorrow , but today . DT above column is sponsor - generated content from Pfizer .

No , PRP have a patent and already have DT antidote ( MAR. 16 , 2020 ) — This is CD of DT most important posts PRP have ever released . In DT last 48 hours — just as DT NNP lock down was occurring in DT NNP — researchers uncovered DT likely culprits behind DT NNP bioweapon . Despite DT obvious U.S. Patent . No. 10,130,701 held by DT Pirbright Institute ( UK ) operated by DT Wellcome Trust , no NN in DT mainstream NN is talking about this glaring fact . Even DT alt - NN is mute . PRP believe because DT culprits are using every propaganda trick in their playbook to prevent a light being shined on DT British Privy Council and DT Queen . NNP has been blamed , sort of , although DT specifics are vague . PRP have shown IN just a four - hour drive from Wuhan is Nanchang and DT Merial Animal NNP Institute manufacturing NNS for DT Pirbright Institute . DT decision by DT Pirbright Institute ( Wellcome Trust ) to move their Merial NNP NN manufacturing plant offsite was taken after a virulent foot and mouth outbreak at their Merial plant . On Oct. 12 , 2009 , Merial moved their plant to Nanchang , NNP and slapped a JJ “ Boehringer Mannheim “ shingle on their Merial Pirbright UK plant , then carried on merrily . Same plant , different name , same controller : Wellcome Trust . This means DT British have , right now , a Merial ( Wellcome Trust ) NN manufacturing plant just four hours away from NNP ground zero . But , why is no NN pointing out this obviously suspicious FACT . All PRP MD take to release DT NNP in Wuhan is for an employee at Merial to VB in DT car a vile of NNP vile , and sprinkle PRP around in Wuhan . Better yet , send a 5G signal in Wuhan ( a 5G test city ) to instruct NNP nanotubes developed by just indicted Harvard Professor and popular Wuhan University of Technology nanotechnology lecturer Dr. Charles Lieber to release their deadly NNP microbe payloads . See previous post . WHO WAS DT WELLCOME TRUST CHAIRMAN WHO SET UP DT MERIAL NANCHANG PLANT NEAR WUHAN ? DT Wellcome Trust chair was Baroness Elizabeth Lydia Manningham - Buller , DT former director of British MI5 ( 2002 -2007 ) . Her mother was GCHQ . Her father was Privy Council , Attorney General and Solicitor General , with a “ Bullying Manner . ” She is an eighth - generation peer . DT ’s not all , Manningham - Buller RB chaired Genome Research Limited ( 2008 - 2015 ) , a wholly - owned subsidiary of Wellcome Trust . DT ’s not all , Manningham - Buller RB chaired Genome Research Limited ( 2008 - 2015 ) , a wholly - owned subsidiary of Wellcome Trust . In Oct. 2013 , Baronness Manningham - Buller was DT keynote speaker at DT Pilgrims of Great Britain London at DT Sir Harry Brittain Memorial Lecture . Sir Harry Brittain was DT founder of DT Pilgrims Society ( with about 50 British peers including Viscount Alfred Milner and Winston Churchill ) in 1902 . MI5 , MI6 and GCHQ were founded from newspapermen who attended DT Pilgrims ’ First Imperial Press Conference , 1909 . Given her father ’s membership in DT Privy Council and her Wellcome Trust intimacies , her membership in DT Privy Council and DT Pilgrims Society are certain . Operating from DT same Wellcome Genome Campus is Genomics England Limited ( controlled by DT Queen ’s Golden Share ) . Of particular note are two Genomics England director - chairs : PRP have already written about Sir Chisholm ’s formation of QinetiQ ( when SERCO moved into DT U.S. ) and DT fact IN former C.I.A. director George Tenet , and former vice chairman of DT Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Edmund P. Giambastiani Jr. were QinetiQ directors . QinetiQ has been awarded over $ 8 billion in U.S. contracts in space , satellites , information technology , military and NN agencies . See previous post . QinetiQ has received over $ 8.5 billion U.S. federal contracts . ( PDF | Excel - downloads directly to your Downloads folder ) . SERCO has received over $ 9.5 billion U.S. federal contracts . PDF | Excel - downloads directly to your Downloads folder ) While our research zeroed in long ago on DT Anglo - American Pilgrims Society as DT actual “ Deep NN ” globally , and while PRP have gotten tantalizingly close to find this person , his or her name has alluded PRP . Now PRP have found him : Sir Jonathan Richard Symonds . On Sep. 01 , 2019 , Symonds was appointed chairman of GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Plc , DT successor to Glaxo Wellcome . GSK is strategically aligned with Wellcome Trust where former MI5 director Manningham - Buller is DT current chair . Symonds has been a director of HSBC Holdings plc since 2014 - just months after James Comey left an HSBC directorship to become FBI director . He has been HSBC deputy group chair since 2018 , he was RB chair of HSBC Bank plc ( 2014 - 2018 ) until just recently . Symonds was RB chief financial officer of drug manufacturer Novartis AG ( 2009 - 2013 ) . Prior to Novartis , Symonds was managing director of Goldman Sachs ( 2007 -2009 ) . Symonds was RB chief financial officer of AstraZeneca PLC ( 1997-2007 ) . Here is DT lynchpin WDT shows Symonds is DT organizational Deep Throat of DT Anglo - American Pilgrims Society . He was director and audit chair of DT newly - formed QinetiQ ( Feb. 28 , 2003 - Jun. 30 , 2004 ) DT PRIVY COUNCIL’S ACCOUNTANT FOR DT QUEEN’S “ GOLDEN SHARE ” CONTROLS NN COMMERCE Symonds was QinetiQ ’s second director just long enough to set up DT chart of accounts and DT share stock structure giving DT Monarch ’s Special Share ( “ Golden Share ” ) control of DT company no matter how JJ sub-classes of stock were established . QinetiQ shares property with DT Pirbright Institute ( Wellcome Trust ) , DT patent holder of DT NNP financed by Wellcome Trust and DT Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation . See RB NNP Traced to DT British Crown . Our latest discovery IN Baroness Eliza Manningham - Buller , former head of MI5 ( 2002 - 2007 ) , is chair of Wellcome Trust and their related DNA - harvesting research associates , further confirms IN DT Anglo - American Pilgrims Society are making their move to dramatically reduce DT NN population by attacking our blood streams Their secret JJ communications network is being managed by DT Anglo - American Pilgrims Society WDT is protected by DT British Privy Council and DT American Senior Executive Service ( SES ) PRP operate a secret JJ satellite system for themselves out of DT Cobbett Hill Earthstation adjacent to DT Pirbright Institute ( UK ) — on DT site of DT 2007 foot and mouth outbreak ( READ : EX are demons in those fields ) Yes , this is hard to believe , but these facts are now screaming for PRP to pay attention . PRP have our blessed NNS and beautiful NN to save . Betsy and Thomas had a few things to say about M , Q , James Bond , and DT Queen . Listen to audio below :"

View_NN Deal_NN","MD DT NN NN combat DT ? DT 's DT question NNP Donald NNP asked during a White house roundtable discussion between his NN task force and pharmaceutical company executives on Monday ( March 2 ) . His question was answered with a direct "" no "" from an executive . DT is designed to prevent infections with viruses , which are very different than coronaviruses . But DT answer is slightly more complicated than DT : DT NN NN wo n't prevent PRP from getting a NN , but PRP can help officials better respond to DT outbreak of NN - CD , DT NN caused by DT JJ NN . "" I do VB immunizing NNS against influenza has a very important indirect effect , "" VBD Dr. Albert Ko , a professor and department chair at DT Yale School of NNP NNP . First , NN care workers are already burdened by NN NNS so getting a NN shot , reduces DT number of NN patients , thereby helping to "" relieve pressures "" in hospitals RB treating patients with NN - CD , he VBD . But EX 's another reason a NN shot MD improve DT country 's response to DT JJ outbreak : DT U.S. is lagging behind other NNS in testing for NNP - CD . And DT 's unlikely to improve in DT near term . On Thursday ( March 5 ) , Vice NNP Mike Pence , who is leading DT administration 's response to DT NN , announced IN DT U.S. does not have enough test kits to meet demand . How does DT relate to DT NN ? If NNS VBP their NN shots , fewer NNS come down with DT NN and come into clinics with nonspecific symptoms such as fever and cough , which overlap with . Having fewer NN patients will make PRP easier to find DT patients with NN - CD , he VBD . Higher NN rates MD "" make PRP much more efficient in detecting NN , "" NNS , Ko told Live NNP . Finding NN - CD NNS is still akin to picking a "" needle out of a haystack , "" but reducing NN NNS can "" decrease DT haystack , "" he added . As SARS - CoV - 2 is spreading in communities on both coasts of DT U.S. , distinguishing between NN and NNP - CD will become more difficult . On DT bright side , PRP is "" incredibly rare , "" to catch both DT NN and NN - CD at once , VBD Dr. Eric Cioe Peña , director of NNP NNP , Northwell NNP in NNP York and an emergency room physician . "" Usually if PRP have CD , PRP do n't have DT other . "" NN season is naturally dying down as spring approaches , but for those who have n't yet done so , "" PRP still recommend getting a NN shot , "" he added . NNS with DT NN are still coming into DT hospital and EX 's always a chance EX MD be a second spike of DT NN , Peña told Live NNP . DT being VBN , NN NNS in NNP York City have been down 25 % each week for DT past two weeks , he VBD . PRP 's a positive step "" WDT PRP are n't seeing as JJ NN patients in DT ER , so PRP have more room for severe NN patients , "" Peña VBD .

South Africa ’s NNP - CD epidemic has bucked some of DT trends seen in other nations . Locking down early , just three weeks after DT first case was confirmed on March 5 , seems to have spared DT country DT rapid exponential rise seen in Italy and Spain . But DT country has been unable to stop DT spread , as South Korea and NNP Zealand managed to . NN models predict IN NNP - CD will claim between 40,000 and 48,000 South African lives by DT end of this NN . Now , as DT country eases restrictions , which will allow its cash - strapped citizens to earn a living , South Africa is bracing for a wave of infections . NN - care networks designed to fight DT NN ’s most devastating co-epidemic — HIV and TB — are being subsumed into DT NN - CD response . DT NN has deployed more than 28,000 community NN workers to screen for DT NN in poor areas , and teams once established to trace DT contacts of TB patients have pivoted to handling this NN ’s pandemic . Yet JJ fear IN shifting these resources MD undo some of DT hard - won progress made against HIV and TB . National data show IN during DT lockdown , DT number of TB tests conducted was cut in half , as NNS MD n’t visit clinics , or did n’t VB to for fear PRP might catch DT NN . According to JJ NN workers , DT lockdown saw a drop in patients accessing their TB and HIV therapies , and a large nationwide survey conducted by DT country ’s Human Sciences Research Council found IN 13 percent of patients have struggled to access regular medication during DT NN - CD lockdown . “ PRP ’s VBG to take PRP NNS to recover what PRP ’ve lost in DT past few months , ” says Gavin Churchyard , CEO of DT Aurum Institute , a Johannesburg - based research and NN nonprofit . DT Khayelitsha Field Hospital is CD of several temporary facilities established to house NNP - CD patients in Cape Town , which — with two - thirds of DT country ’s more than 50,000 NN NNS — is DT current epicentre of South Africa ’s epidemic . DT field hospitals in Cape Town collectively plan to add 1,400 beds by DT end of this month — but projections show DT city MD still run out of beds when DT peak hits in July . Khayelitsha residents face myriad challenges , from food and job insecurity to gender - based violence and drug abuse . Whereas any of these challenges MD tip somebody into poverty or cause them to drop out of long - term HIV or TB care , NNP - CD “ will make all those things worse , ” Keene says ."

And_CC it_PRP would_MD go_VB against_IN almost_RB every_DT other_JJ virus_NN that_WDT we_PRP ’ve_VBP known_VBN about_IN ,_, she_PRP says_VBZ ._.","Getting ahead of DT NN Viruses are stealthy . PRP disguise themselves as PRP infect a host and penetrate IN host ’s cells , which gives them a head start over DT body ’s immune response . Once a cell recognizes certain telltale signs of a pathogen , PRP throws out an alarm signal to DT immune system . But because DT NN has DT head start , PRP still has NN to replicate itself and infect a JJ host before DT immune system can catch up . DT ’s why someone ’s first experience with an infectious NN can be so nasty . DT immune system is not so easily tricked a second NN : When PRP ’s beaten an invader once , PRP keeps a specialized weapons cache dedicated to DT particular pathogen , ready to mount a high - speed reaction if PRP ’s ever detected again . So , DT second NN DT NN shows up in your body , DT NN wo n’t have DT handy head start . To have herd immunity , each infected person must , on average , infect less than CD person ( though clearly , PRP ’s not possible to infect half a person ; if some infected NNS pass on DT infection and others do n’t , DT average transmission rate will be less than CD . ) Once DT transmission rate drops below CD , a community has herd immunity . DT wo n’t stop each and every case , but PRP will prevent DT NN from spreading indefinitely . JJ of our lessons on herd immunity come from DT measles , because PRP 's so contagious . DT more infectious a NN is , DT more NNS who need to be immune to reach herd immunity . CD person with measles , for instance , MD infect up to 18 other NNS in a susceptible population . To VB DT transmission rate all DT way down to less than CD , almost everyone in DT population needs to act as a buffer between an infected person and a JJ potential host . DT ’s why measles needs such a high rate of herd immunity — around 95 percent . DT do ’s and don’ts of making a herd NNS create a weapons cache for a NN without DT body ever having to fight off DT NN itself , which is why herd immunity is something WDT ’s generally pursued through NN rather than infection . For example , about 30 percent of measles NNS have complications such as seizures , pneumonia , and encephalitis , resulting in about two deaths for every thousand NNS in DT U.S. Exposing a whole population to measles MD be a dangerous way to cultivate herd immunity among DT survivors . “ DT problem with NN is IN no - PRP has had PRP before , regardless of age , ” says Gostic of DT University of Chicago . PRP ’s almost as if chicken pox had just emerged for DT first NN , leaving adults more susceptible to DT more severe NNS WDT come with age , she explains . Herd immunity RB is n’t something WDT can work for any NN . PRP does n’t matter how JJ NNS are vaccinated against tetanus , for example : If someone who is n’t vaccinated steps on a rusty nail , PRP can still VB infected , because tetanus lives in reservoirs outside of DT human body . An infection must be transmitted between NNS for herd immunity to have a protective effect . Immunity RB does n’t always last RB long . HIV mutates so quickly IN PRP can actually evolve within a single person , says Jessie Abbate , an infectious NN expert at DT Research Institute for Development in France . Swiftly mutating NN is RB a moving target for immunity and NNS , which is why each NN season ’s NN needs to anticipate DT strain WDT will circulate widely , she explains . What does this mean for NN ? Four other coronaviruses already circulate among humans , says Gaunt , and PRP all cause DT common cold , since PRP do n’t stay immune to those viruses for very long . If DT novel NN is similar , DT means IN NNS MD need to be repeatedly vaccinated or infected for herd immunity to be sustained . Some reports describe reinfections of DT novel NN in NNS who tested positive again after PRP had already recovered . PRP ’s not clear , though , IN these are actually NNS of reinfection — PRP ’s more likely IN PRP can be explained by NNS continuing to shed DT NN for a long NN , and IN DT level of NN shedding fluctuates over NN . Rapid reinfection is , for now , “ an outside possibility , ” Abbate agrees .

Ackerman explains , “ PRP ’s VBG to be an interesting depression because PRP have all DT infrastructure of affluence . PRP have achieved a pinnacle of affluence , and DT metaphor I use is riding to DT soup kitchen on an $ 8,000 trail bike . . . . I hope PRP find things WDT make life worth VBG on without all DT stuff . So , PRP are VBG to be in a period of living without all DT good stuff , and DT is VBG to be DT norm . EX is RB a really hopeful side to JJ distress , but PRP are most surely headed into a period of severe distress . . . and a period of living without . PRP will find PRP are not living without things WDT are intrinsic to human nature WDT are good . . . . PRP VBG to have to find ways to VB along because PRP are headed into hard times . ” A few NNS ago , Ackerman predicted IN DT trend for interest rates was down . DT 10 NN Treasury is now near a record low . Does Ackerman see rates VBG even lower ? Ackerman says , “ Yes , I see lower rates . I VBP PRP will have lower rates until , at some point in DT future , NNS will start sniffing out a hyperinflation . PRP VBP I have been a deflationist for a lot of NNS . I VBP PRP will have to cross DT valley of deflation , but somewhere EX is a hyperinflation . PRP wo n’t take high interest rates to do PRP because PRP will be dealing with a real burden of debt WDT is VBG to be crushing no matter where interest rates are even if PRP are fixed at 2 % . ” Ackerman sees DT 10 - NN Treasury hitting “ .25 % . ” Is real estate a safe bet ? Ackerman says , “ When real assets start to sink IN real estate , what are PRP VBG to do ? Are PRP VBG to send mortgage checks out on behalf of homeowners to DT lenders ? . . . . PRP ’d have to be crazy to VB when real estate opens up PRP will be trading at DT prices in February . PRP will VB a 25 % haircut from DT NN VB . . . because PRP are VBG to have to deal with a lot of speculative excesses . . . . Minimum , PRP will be down 25 % , which will bring PRP close to DT 2007 - 2008 where real estate across DT country lost about 33 % of its value . I have been saying for a long NN IN real estate will sink 70 % with maybe a 90 % drop in second homes . Everything has come back from DT last NN , but I VBP PRP are VBG to do DT whole 70 % drop in value this next NN . ” Ackerman RB thinks cash will be valuable in DT future because PRP will be rare . Ackerman points out IN DT “ debt being destroyed and defaulted on dwarfs DT amount of money printing ” for now , and DT is deflationary . So , he likes cash in DT near term and gold in DT longer term . Ackerman contends , “ What do PRP use to buy stuff now ? PRP use credit cards or real cash pretty much . If PRP have deleveraging of DT derivatives market and DT daisy chain and clearing relationships for credit cards and debit cards . . . I do n’t VB IN system MD survive DT implosion of DT derivatives market . So , PRP leaves PRP with cash and barter . I hate to say PRP , but PRP are VBG to VB RB at some point . . . . This MD happen tomorrow because of some little accident . PRP do n’t VB –like nobody knew DT NN was coming . ” Ackerman says he likes gold because even in deflation , debt default and destruction , “ Gold will hold its value . . . . Gold is catching on now because of uncertainty and not inflation — yet . ” In closing , Ackerman says , “ I still believe PRP are VBG to have a deflationary abyss to cross before PRP VBP to DT hyperinflation of DT mind where NNS realize DT NN ’s obligation either to default on Treasury debt or not is DT crux of DT hyperinflation argument . Yes , at DT point , I have to acknowledge DT Fed can print money without limit , and PRP MD have to . ” Join Greg Hunter as he goes CD - on - CD with analyst / trader Rick Ackerman .

DT person being named to DT position is a former executive with GlaxoSmithKline , a criminal corporation WDT admitted to a large - scale felony bribery scheme in its $ 3 billion settlement with DT DOJ . GSK ’s bribery scheme involved 44,000 doctors and violated DT laws of every NN in DT nation . With no qualms about doing business with corporate felons , NNP NNP is now jumping in bed with Big Pharma criminals to turn DT American NNS into human guinea pigs in order to push Big Pharma profits and try to boost DT stock market in NN for DT November elections . And instead of choosing to work with a corporation WDT has no criminal record , he chose DT NN maker WDT has DT worst criminal record across DT entire NN industry . Moncef Slaoui , a former GlaxoSmithKline executive , will lead “ Operation Warp Speed , ” NNP ’s push to accelerate DT NN development process for NNP - CD , according to an administration official . Slaoui is to serve in a volunteer capacity , and will be assisted by Army Gen. Gustave Perna , DT commander of NNP NNPS Army Materiel Command . If PRP ’re wondering why a NNP Army general is getting involved with DT GlaxiSmithKline NN push , PRP ’s because NNP has just announced he ’s VBG to “ rapidly mobilize ” DT NNP military to distribute DT NN , according to CBS NNP : “ PRP ’re mobilizing our military and other forces but PRP ’re mobilizing our military on DT basis IN PRP do have a NN . PRP VBP , PRP ’s a massive job to give this NN . Our military is now being mobilized so at DT end of DT NN PRP ’re VBG to be able to give PRP to a lot of NNS very , very rapidly , ” DT NN VBD PRP ’s quite clear IN NNP is describing a military - run forced NN program WDT involves mandatory injections , “ to a lot of NNS very , very rapidly . ” Why MD DT NNP military be required to distribute a NN ? Because , of course , DT NN wo n’t be optional . NNP NNP is VBG to use DT NNP NNPS military to force vaccinate millions of Americans against their will . NNP has sold out America and is now VBG to turn DT American NNS into live human guinea pigs for Big Pharma ’s mad NN experiments . DT entire “ Operation Warp Speed ” scheme is about skipping safety tests and clinical trials in order to roll out a risky , untested , unsafe NN WDT will be injected into PRP at gunpoint . DT ’s why DT military is about to be deployed across DT NNP NNPS to administer NNS . NNP has betrayed his nation and DT American NNS . He is now an agent of Big Pharma and DT anti-human rights NN industry WDT uses human NNS for JJ experiments , all around DT NN . PRP wo n’t be just any normal NN , either . Yesterday DT Dept. of Defense issued a press release celebrating its effort to acquire 500 million “ ApiJect ” NN injection devices to be ready for DT NN NN . As described on DT ApiJect website , DT ApiJect syringe features RFID tracking and GPS geo-location combined with JJ data sharing with a NN cloud : With an optional RFID / NFC tag on each BFS prefilled syringe , ApiJect will make this possible . Before giving an injection , DT healthcare worker will be able to launch a free mobile app and “ tap ” DT prefilled syringe on their phone , capturing DT NFC tag ’s unique serial number , GPS location and date / NN . DT app then uploads DT data to a NN - selected cloud database . Aggregated injection data provides NN administrators an evolving real - NN “ injection map . ” So DT military will be “ mobilized ” across America to administer forced NNS WDT are tagged with RFID and GPS location data , linked to your personal identification and synced with a NN database WDT will of course be used very soon to enforce “ immunity passports ” and other Bill Gatesian ideas rooted in JJ tyranny . Are PRP getting DT picture yet ? NNP Trump. GlaxoSmithKline . Operation Warp Speed . Big Tech censorship of “ anti-vax ” information . Department of Defense . Military deployment . “ Injection map ” tracking with GPS and RFID … Are PRP getting DT picture yet ? PRP are about to be tagged , gagged and bagged , then medically raped by an armed agent of DT NNP administration . NNP has sold PRP out to DT NN industry , and he ’s about to roll out a JJ - military dictatorship across America . This is VBG to turn most of his existing base against him , by DT way , which is why his odds of being re-elected are plunging by DT day . PRP had previously estimated just a 1 in 8 chance of him winning re-election , but now PRP estimate a 1 in 4 chance IN he will somehow find a way to cancel DT elections and declare himself a military dictator , assuming power during DT very “ emergency ” IN he helped create through his own pandemic denialism and DT selling out of DT American NNS to DT NN industry . PRP are calling on NNP to declare whether these military - backed NNS are intended to be optional or mandatory . And if NNP wo n’t answer DT question , PRP can conclude PRP will be mandatory . NNP is following in DT footsteps of tyrannical dictators who carried out mass genocide against their own NNS DT means NNP is setting himself up along DT lines of Stalin , Mao and Pol Pot to VB down in history as a genocidal maniac who mass murdered his own NNS in order to appease his corporate puppet masters . Look at DT facts . DT DoD announcement . DT ApiJect RFID technology . DT “ rapid mobilization ” of DT NNP military to “ distribute ” DT NNS . Look at who ’s running DT White House NN response : Dr. Fauci , DT criminal at DT NIH who funneled money to DT Wuhan virology lab WDT engineered DT very same bioweapon WDT ’s now ravaging our economy and resulting in forced lockdowns . Look at how no action has been taken against Obama , James Comey or DT Clintons . Ever wonder why ? Because PRP ’re all working for DT same globalist agenda . Big Pharma has conquered DT White House , and PRP already control DT NN and Big Tech . Now PRP ’re coming for your body , and anyone who resists will likely be medically raped with a forced NN injection WDT was never subjected to rigorous clinical trials or typical safety standards . NNP NNP is now all - in with Big Pharma and its globalist agenda of mass human extermination and depopulation . Have no illusions . Connect DT dots . This conclusion is now inescapable , even for those of PRP who voted for NNP and supported him in 2016 . NNP is now an agent of Big Pharma and DT NN industry . Prepare to join DT pro-human resistance against NNP and Big Pharma . If PRP allow yourself to be injected with this euthanasia NN , PRP will be killed by a subsequent infection after DT Fauci / Wuhan “ NNP - 21 ” bioweapons release next NN ."

Psychologists call this continuous partial attention , and PRP applies as much to virtual environments as PRP does to real ones . VB of how hard PRP MD be to cook and read at DT same NN . DT 's DT kind of multi-tasking your brain is trying , and often failing , to navigate in a group video chat . This leads to problems in which group video chats become less collaborative and more IN siloed panels , in which only two NNS at a NN talk while DT rest listen . Because each participant is using CD audio stream and is aware of all DT other voices , parallel conversations are impossible . If PRP view a single speaker at a NN , PRP ca n’t recognise how non-active participants are behaving — something PRP MD normally pick up with peripheral vision . For some NNS , DT prolonged split in attention creates a perplexing sense of being drained while having accomplished nothing . DT brain becomes overwhelmed by unfamiliar excess stimuli while being hyper - focused on searching for non-verbal cues WDT PRP ca n’t find . DT ’s why a traditional phone call MD be less taxing on DT brain , Franklin says , because PRP delivers on a small promise : to convey only a voice . By contrast , DT sudden shift to video calls has been a boon for NNS who have neurological difficulty with in - person exchanges , such as those with NN who can become overwhelmed by multiple NNS talking . John Upton , an editor at DT NNP Jersey - based NN outlet NNP Central , recently found out he is autistic . Late last NN , he was struggling with DT mental load of attending packed conferences , engaging during in - person meetings , and navigating DT small - talk WDT ’s common in work places .

Even then , Newsom reserves DT right of : • DT NNP NNP NNP Officer to revise DT criteria and procedures of Stage Two “ as she deems necessary to respond to DT dynamic threat posed by COVID19 ” ; and of • County and local NN officers “ to establish and implement JJ NN measures within their respective jurisdictions WDT are more restrictive than ” DT statewide Stage Two policy . As an example , Newsom ’s Stage Two announcement conflicts with a more restrictive mandate issued Monday in six Bay Area counties ( Alameda , Contra Costa , Marin , San Francisco , San Mateo and Santa Clara ) which continues to prohibit most retail businesses , except for “ essential ” businesses such as grocery stores , from opening through NNP 31 . Newsom VBD counties can keep their more strict guidelines in place and do not have to come into compliance with DT NN order : “ PRP are not telling locals WDT feel PRP ’s too soon , too fast to modify . ” SFGate reports IN DT “ lower - risk businesses ” WDT are allowed to reopen in Stage Two include bookstores , clothing shops , sporting goods stores and flower shops , provided IN ( a ) their local officials give approval ; and ( b ) DT businesses make changes in their operations , such as having workers wear masks . Newsom will detail DT JJ guidelines and requirements later this week . Dine - in restaurants and offices will be part of a “ later Stage 2 opening ” –whatever WDT means . More disturbing still is what Newsom VBD at a press briefing in Sacramento yesterday — California will not return to “ normal ” until EX is immunity from DT Wuhan NN SARS - CoV - 2 via a NN . He VBD : Readers ’ comments on SFGate are mostly critical of Newsom . DT best comment is this NN from reader “ gilgotha ” : DT problems with a NN are : • Although by Moderna Therapeutics , a biotech company based in Cambridge , Mass. , and DT NIH is readying DT NN for human testing , PRP MD be 12 to 18 months at best before PRP ’s ready for DT NN — which means California wo n’t return to normal until CD to 1 ½ NNS from now , at best . • DT Wuhan NN has already mutated into at least 30 different strains , which means whatever NN WDT is developed will not be 100 % effective , just as DT NN for DT seasonal NN is , at best , only partially effective . As an example , DT 2019 - 2020 seasonal NN NN is only — “ effective ” defined as reduction in doctor ’s visits for NN illness . • According to a JJ survey , CD - third of Americans say PRP wo n’t VB vaccinated against DT Wuhan NN even if / when a NN becomes available .

DT NNP - CD pandemic left Katie Viney , her husband Tony and their daughter Rhiannon locked down at home near Oxford , England . PRP did n’t VB to stand by and do nothing , and PRP MD now VB down in NN history by all taking part in Britain ’s first human trial of a potential NN . "" So JJ other NNS have been able to do their bit and I just thought , I 'm not a nurse , I 'm not a trained doctor , so this is DT thing I can do , "" CD - NN - old Rhiannon told Euronews . DT Vineys are among more than 1,000 healthy volunteers recruited for DT trial , led by DT University of Oxford . Half of DT participants are getting DT prototype NN , DT others a placebo . DT British NN VBD this week PRP was pumping more money into such efforts to develop a NN , by giving an additional 84 million pounds ( €94 million ) to DT NN underway in Oxford as well as toward a separate NN trial at Imperial College London . All participants in DT Oxford trial have now received their dose , Business Secretary Alok Sharma VBD on Sunday . If PRP proves a success , DT NN plans to roll out DT NN to 30 million NNS by September . DT Vineys have been regularly taking their temperatures , keeping an eye out for any symptoms . "" PRP 've had absolutely no side effects whatsoever , really , I can't even feel where I 've had DT injection . And I 'm not at all worried , I 've got no concerns about having this , "" VBD Katie . "" DT hope , as with everybody , is IN PRP find DT NN WDT MD let DT NN VB back to whatever ' normal ' becomes , "" VBD Tony . "" PRP 's really nice to be able to volunteer for something IN this , and PRP feel a bit honoured to be able to do DT , truthfully . "" What is DT NN being tested ? DT University of Oxford announced in April IN PRP had reached a deal with AstraZeneca WDT MD see DT pharmaceutical company manufacture and distribute DT NN globally . DT NN candidate , called ChAdOx1 nCoV - CD , is made from a weakened version of a common cold NN WDT causes infections in chimpanzees , and DT was genetically modified so IN PRP cannot develop in humans . Further genetic material was added to make DT spike protein found on DT surface of SARS - CoV - 2 , DT NN WDT causes NN - CD . DT spike protein , which binds to receptors on human cells , is believed to play a key role in infecting NNS with DT JJ NN . As a whole , DT NN prototype aims to make DT body recognise and develop an immune response to DT spike protein , to stop DT NN from infecting human cells . How is PRP being tested ? Researchers now VBP to see whether DT NN triggers an immune response to stop NN - CD infection – and keep any side effects in check . Volunteers are given either DT NN NN candidate or an existing NN against meningitis WDT ’s used as a ‘ control ’ for comparison . DT meningitis NN is typically given to teenagers or used as a travel NN . DT reason for selecting PRP rather than saline NN , for instance , is because NNS expect DT NN NN to cause some small side effects such as a sore arm , headache and fever . If PRP used saline , which MD cause no such side effects , PRP fear participants MD automatically VB whether PRP were given DT JJ NN or DT placebo . "" PRP is critical for this NN IN participants remain blinded to whether or not PRP have received DT NN , as , if PRP knew , this MD affect their NN behaviour in DT community following NN , and MD lead to a bias in DT results of DT NN , "" DT university explains . When will PRP VB whether or not PRP works ? To assess whether DT NN protects from NN - CD , NNS will compare DT number of infections in DT control group with DT number of infections in DT vaccinated group . DT trial therefore relies on some participants developing NN - CD . And how quickly PRP VBP infected and transmit DT NN will influence how quickly DT trial will yield results . DT team expects to collect enough data within six months at most . If DT results are encouraging , late - stage trials of DT NN 's effectiveness MD take place in DT second half of this NN . DT 's much faster than usual procedures , which usually take several NNS . If DT NN does n’t show positive results in DT first phase , DT university MD decide to VB dosing or stop DT trial altogether . Getting a NN to market usually takes NNS , not months , and some experts have warned IN DT magic bullet against NNP - CD MD never be found . With no guarantee of success on a NN , Oxford University is RB leading what PRP describes as DT NN 's biggest treatment trial . HIV and anti-malarial drugs , as well as an antibiotic , are among those being tested on NNP - CD patients . Professor Richard Haynes , who coordinates DT Recovery clinical trial at DT University of Oxford , says PRP ’s important to continue hunting for effective treatments too , as “ some NNS will end up in hospital even when PRP have a NN . ” “ Over DT past eight weeks , PRP 've now recruited over 10,000 NNS from over 180 different hospitals . PRP 're testing lots of different treatments and at DT moment PRP 's too early to say whether any of them are beneficial or not . PRP wo n't VB . But hopefully , PRP 'll VB some answers over DT summer , "" he VBD . PRP can RB watch Damon 's report in DT video player above ."

DT immune system is DT body 's defense against infections . DT immune ( ih - MYOON ) system attacks germs and helps keep PRP healthy . What Are DT Parts of DT Immune System ? JJ cells and organs work together to protect DT body . White blood cells , RB called leukocytes ( LOO - kuh - sytes ) , play an important role in DT immune system . Some types of white blood cells , called phagocytes ( FAH - guh - sytes ) , chew up invading organisms . Others , called lymphocytes ( LIM - fuh - sytes ) , help DT body remember DT invaders and destroy them . CD type of phagocyte is DT neutrophil ( NOO - truh - fil ) , which fights bacteria . When someone might have bacterial infection , doctors can order a blood test to see if PRP caused DT body to have lots of neutrophils . Other types of phagocytes do their own jobs to make sure IN DT body responds to invaders . DT two kinds of lymphocytes are B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes . Lymphocytes start out in DT bone marrow and either stay RB and mature into B cells , or VBP to DT thymus gland to mature into T cells . B lymphocytes are IN DT body 's military intelligence system — PRP find their targets and send defenses to lock onto them . T cells are IN DT soldiers — PRP destroy DT invaders WDT DT intelligence system finds . How Does DT Immune System Work ? When DT body senses foreign substances ( called antigens ) , DT immune system works to recognize DT antigens and VB rid of them . B lymphocytes are triggered to make antibodies ( RB called immunoglobulins ) . These proteins lock onto specific antigens . After PRP 're made , antibodies usually stay in our bodies in case PRP have to fight DT same germ again . DT 's why someone who gets sick with a NN , IN chickenpox , usually wo n't VB sick from PRP again . This is RB how immunizations ( NNS ) prevent some diseases . An immunization introduces DT body to an antigen in a way WDT does n't make someone sick . But PRP does let DT body make antibodies WDT will protect DT person from future attack by DT germ . Although antibodies can recognize an antigen and lock onto PRP , PRP can't destroy PRP without help . DT 's DT job of DT T cells . PRP destroy antigens tagged by antibodies or cells WDT are infected or somehow changed . ( Some T cells are actually called "" killer cells . "" ) T cells RB help signal other cells ( IN phagocytes ) to do their jobs . • neutralize toxins ( poisonous or damaging substances ) produced by different organisms • activate a group of proteins called complement WDT are part of DT immune system . Complement helps kill bacteria , viruses , or infected cells . These specialized cells and parts of DT immune system offer DT body protection against NN . This protection is called immunity . Humans have three types of immunity — innate , adaptive , and passive : • Innate immunity : Everyone is born with innate ( or natural ) immunity , a type of general protection . For example , DT skin acts as a barrier to block germs from entering DT body . And DT immune system recognizes when certain invaders are foreign and MD be dangerous . • Adaptive immunity : Adaptive ( or active ) immunity develops throughout our lives . PRP develop adaptive immunity when PRP 're exposed to diseases or when PRP 're immunized against them with NNS . • Passive immunity : Passive immunity is "" borrowed "" from another source and PRP lasts for a short NN . For example , antibodies in a mother 's breast milk give a baby temporary immunity to diseases DT mother has been exposed to . DT immune system takes a while to develop and needs help from NNS . By getting all your child 's recommended NNS on NN , PRP can help keep your child as healthy as possible ."

There_EX is_VBZ no_DT cure_NN for_IN post_NN -_HYPH polio_NN syndrome_NN ._.","EX are three known serotypes ( closely related though distinguishable forms ) of wild poliovirus : PV1 , PV2 , and PV3 . DT most - widespread serotype is PV1 . PV2 likely has been eradicated ; DT last PV2 case was reported in 1999 in Uttar Pradesh , India . DT third serotype , PV3 , is close to eradication . Polio , in full poliomyelitis , RB called infantile paralysis , acute viral infectious NN of DT nervous system WDT usually begins with general symptoms such as fever , headache , nausea , fatigue , and muscle pains and spasms and is sometimes followed by a more - serious and permanent paralysis of muscles in CD or more limbs , DT throat , or DT chest . More than half of all NNS of polio occur in NNS under DT age of five . DT paralysis so commonly associated with DT NN actually affects fewer than 1 percent of persons infected by DT poliovirus . Between 5 and 10 percent of infected persons display only DT general symptoms outlined above , and more than 90 percent show no signs of illness at all . For those infected by DT poliovirus , EX is no cure , and in DT mid-20th century hundreds of thousands of NNS were struck by DT NN every NN . Since DT 1960s , thanks to widespread use of polio NNS , polio has been eliminated from most of DT NN . PRP is now endemic in only three NNS : Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Nigeria . Nigeria , however , was on DT brink of being polio - free in 2015 . Worldwide , since 1988 DT number of reported polio NNS has dropped by more than 99 percent . DT course of DT NN Poliomyelitis means “ gray marrow inflammation , ” referring to DT propensity of DT poliovirus to attack certain cells in DT spinal cord and brainstem . DT poliovirus is a picornavirus ( family Picornaviridae ) , a member of a group known as enteroviruses WDT inhabits DT human digestive tract . ( Human beings are DT only known hosts of DT poliovirus . ) DT NN enters DT body most often by DT so - called fecal–oral route — WDT is , from fecal matter taken into DT mouth through contaminated food or fingers . PRP can RB enter by ingestion of droplets expelled from DT throat of an infected person . JJ victims MD become ill about 7 to 14 days after ingesting DT NN . Infected persons MD shed DT NN from their throats for a week , beginning a day or more before suffering any symptoms themselves , and PRP MD continue to shed DT NN in their feces for a month or more after their illness . After DT poliovirus is swallowed , PRP multiplies in lymph nodes of DT intestinal tract and spreads through DT body via DT bloodstream . In some NNS DT NN gets no farther , causing only a vague flulike illness to develop . DT most - common early symptoms of polio are mild headache , fever , sore throat , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , restlessness , and drowsiness . Fever peaks in two to three days and then rapidly subsides , and patients recover within three to four days without DT development of paralysis . In some NNS , however , DT NN begins an assault on DT central nervous system , inflaming and destroying motor cells of DT spinal cord and brainstem . In those NNS patients become irritable and develop pain in DT back and limbs , muscle tenderness , and stiff neck . JJ recover at DT stage , but approximately 1 in 200 persons with polio develops what is known as flaccid paralysis . DT motor impulses WDT normally move along DT nerve fibres from DT spinal cord to muscles are blocked , and , as a result , muscles become limp and cannot contract . DT extent of paralysis depends on where DT NN strikes and DT number of nerve cells WDT PRP destroys . Cells WDT are not severely injured recover their normal function in NN ; to DT extent IN PRP do recover , a corresponding restoration of muscle function MD be expected . Cells WDT are destroyed , however , are not replaced , because nerve cells cannot regenerate . In DT case DT paralysis is complete and permanent , with associated progressive atrophy of DT unused muscles . In most NNS paralytic polio strikes DT limb muscles , particularly DT legs . Paralysis does not always involve DT limbs , however . DT abdominal muscles or DT muscles of DT back MD be paralyzed , affecting posture . DT neck muscles MD become weak , so IN DT head can not be raised . Paralysis of DT face muscles MD cause twisting of DT mouth or drooping eyelids . In some types of spinal polio , DT NN damages DT upper part of DT spinal cord , with resulting difficulties in breathing . In bulbar polio DT NN attacks DT brainstem , and DT nerve centres WDT control swallowing and talking are damaged . Secretions collect in DT throat and MD lead to suffocation by blocking DT airway . Some 5 to 10 percent of persons afflicted with paralytic polio die , usually of respiratory complications . EX seem to be individual differences in DT degree of natural susceptibility to DT NN . JJ persons have acquired antibodies to DT poliovirus in their blood without having had any symptoms of infection . PRP is generally held IN a lasting immunity follows recovery from DT NN . However , because EX are three different serotypes of poliovirus , second attacks can occur . Persons who recover from an infection caused by CD serotype of poliovirus are permanently immune to reinfection by DT serotype but not to infection by DT others . For DT reason polio NNS are trivalent — WDT is , designed to generate antibodies to all three poliovirus serotypes ( see below ) . Among as JJ as CD - quarter of former polio victims whose condition has been stabilized for NNS or even decades , a condition called post - polio syndrome has been recognized . Post - polio syndrome manifests itself as increased weakness , muscle atrophy , or other conditions involving DT originally affected muscle groups or a different group of muscles . DT cause of DT syndrome is not known for certain , but PRP MD arise when nerve branches grown by nerve fibres WDT survived DT original infection begin to deteriorate as DT former polio victim passes through middle age . EX is no cure for post - polio syndrome ."

But while EX are claims IN PRP MD be possible for a NN to be ready within a NN , DT chances of this happening remain slim . DT UK trial , led by DT University of Oxford , will ultimately involve 1100 adults , half of whom will receive DT experimental NN . DT other half will VB a meningitis NN as a control . DT team behind DT trial hopes to move on to tests to gauge how effective DT NN is against DT NN as early as August , raising hopes IN a NN MD be ready before DT end of DT NN , and IN this MD be DT answer to DT difficult question of how DT country gets out of strict social distancing measures . Unfortunately , these hopes are probably misplaced . NN design expert Maria Bottazzi of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , Texas , calls DT schedule “ unrealistic ” . Even if everything goes according to plan in DT first phase of trials , Bottazzi points out IN researchers will still need NN to determine how well DT NN protects NNS from NN - CD and whether PRP provokes any side effects when a vaccinated person is subsequently exposed to DT NN . PRP is far from guaranteed IN DT NN will be safe and effective . 2013 NN calculated IN , before entering clinical trials , DT average experimental NN has a 6 per cent chance of ultimately reaching DT market . Of those WDT make PRP into trials , a 2019 analysis suggests DT probability of success is 33.4 per cent . But even if DT Oxford NN succeeds , EX will then be DT issue of scaling up manufacturing to make hundreds of millions of doses . According to Bottazzi , this is DT real bottleneck . Under DT best of circumstances , DT NN is still looking at 12 to 18 months before a NN MD be widely available , she says . DT in itself MD be a remarkable achievement . DT 2013 NN found IN between 1998 and 2009 , DT average NN taken to develop a NN was 10.7 NNS . PRP is possible to speed this up to some extent – since then , an Ebola NN has become DT fastest - developed NN ever , being produced in just five NNS . But to lower this to just 18 months MD require DT next steps of DT development process to be begun before DT previous ones were completed , Bottazzi says . This increases DT risk of significant loss of investment should DT NN fail to pan out , as well as raising questions about safety . An expedited path from early trials to scaled - up manufacturing MD mean IN researchers wo n’t have as much NN to VB DT long - term effects of a NN in trial participants before PRP is given to DT NN , for example . “ Between 1998 and 2009 , DT average NN taken to develop a NN was 10.7 NNS ” To try to speed things up , on 21 April , UK NN minister Matt Hancock VBD IN DT NN will put money into manufacturing capability , in DT hope IN either DT Oxford NN , or another NN being tested by Imperial College London , will prove successful . Similar measures are being taken elsewhere . NNP philanthropist Bill Gates has announced he is helping to build manufacturing capability for seven candidate NNS – a strategy he VBD will lose billions of dollars but save NN . More than 100 NNS for DT NN are currently in various early stages of development . DT more WDT are tested , DT higher DT chances of finding something WDT is both safe and effective . Yet EX is no guarantee IN PRP is even possible to vaccinate against DT NN . EX is a lot PRP do n’t VB yet about how our immune systems respond to DT NN , and whether PRP is possible to induce long - lasting immunity to PRP . Hancock RB VBD IN DT NN is “ throwing everything ” at developing a NN NN . But given DT NN PRP will take to VB CD – if PRP even proves possible to do so – PRP is clear IN NNS can’t wait for a NN to VB them out of their current crises . As epidemiologist Mark Woolhouse at DT University of Edinburgh , UK , told NNP Scientist in early April : “ I do not VB waiting for a NN should be dignified with DT word ‘ strategy ’ . PRP ’s not a strategy , PRP ’s a hope . ” PRP need to be realistic about DT hopes of a NN , but DT does n’t mean PRP is n’t worth trying . IN annual NN NNS , an effective NN NN MD help PRP protect those most at risk from DT NN . As with childhood NNS for measles and other diseases , PRP MD RB enable PRP to protect future generations from NN - CD . But PRP MD be NNS before PRP have a NN . Until then , PRP will need to deal with multiple waves of infection with measures such as extensive testing , contact tracing and quarantining ."

But DT scientist , who has led NIAID since 1984 , VBD DT NN reminded him of DT day 34 NNS ago when modest results for DT drug AZT signaled DT first potential weapon against HIV . "" DT was not DT end game , because building on DT every NN after PRP did better and better , PRP had better drugs of DT same type , and PRP had drugs against different targets , "" Fauci VBD . AZT , or azidothymidine , was originally developed as a cancer drug . In March 1987 , PRP won FDA approval — in record NN — for use against HIV , at a NN when infection often led to a quick and painful death . DT medicine came with rough side effects , and questions about whether PRP actually extended life . PRP took another decade before NNS developed DT combination antiretroviral drugs WDT transformed HIV into a chronic NN . NNS around DT NN have been racing to find NN treatments , but no drug has been definitively proven effective . Other early data for remdesivir have been mixed , including a pair of studies whose results were released hours ahead of DT NIAID findings . Gilead released its own NN results this morning suggesting IN severely ill patients receiving five days of remdesivir fared just as well as patients receiving a 10 - day dosing regimen . More than half of both dosing groups were discharged from DT hospital within two weeks of beginning their medication . Eight percent of NNS in DT five - day group died while 11 percent in DT 10 - day group died .

Gilead VBD DT data RB suggests IN NNS who received remdesivir early in their infection seemed to fare better than those WDT received PRP later . DT NN is not a traditional trial with a placebo arm to compare against remdesivir for effectiveness , earning Gilead some criticism from policy experts over sharing DT NN alongside DT NIAID results . "" Piggybacking DT severe trial release on [ DT NIAID NN ] is DT part which is unjustifiable , "" VBD Peter Bach , director of Memorial Sloan - Kettering 's Center for NNP Policy and Outcomes .

A USA TODAY analysis of school NN records found IN at more than 2,200 JJ and private schools in 12 NNS , at least a tenth of kindergarten students had either incomplete NN records or had fallen behind schedule in receiving their shots . In some NNS , schools dismiss DT as a documentation problem , pointing out IN JJ students have had at least CD shot . "" PRP have to have all DT information before PRP can start DT work of controlling DT outbreak , "" says Shoana Anderson , director of communicable NN and emergency preparedness for Nashville 's Department of NNP NNP . "" DT amount of staff NN and work WDT PRP takes to gather DT is incredible . And with diseases , PRP do n't often have awhile . "" As an epidemiologist , she spent three months in 2008 trying to contain a measles outbreak in Tuscon . In DT outbreak , which centered around two hospitals and entered at least CD school , half DT 14 confirmed NNS were in NNS with unknown immunization status . Hundreds of hospital workers and a handful of schoolchildren who MD have had contact with DT patients MD n't provide proof of immunization — meaning workers had to be sent home and students kept out of school for as long as 18 days . DT outbreak cost DT hospitals nearly $ 800,000 and 15,000 lost hours of work , mostly because of furloughs , a report from DT Centers for NNP Control and Prevention found . Among those who were n't sure of their NN status , about 10 % were found to have no immunity . "" Most of DT NN , PRP does n't impact PRP — these NNS are so rare IN PRP might never face DT situation , "" Anderson says . "" But when PRP does happen , PRP has a pretty big impact . "" Students arrive at school without their shots for lots of reasons . In low - income neighborhoods , access to doctors has long been an issue . Newly arrived immigrants often appear without proof of immunization or with a spotty history of vaccinations . In some NNS , parents scared of their NNS receiving more shots have decided to slow or stop DT NN schedule . Anderson VBD lost or missing records can be a huge problem if parents VBP doctors or move . Nearly 270 of DT schools with DT highest incomplete record rates were in Los Angeles ' Unified School District . At a handful of schools with DT most extreme NNS , as JJ as nine out of every 10 NNS begin kindergarten under DT NN 's conditional entry program for students missing some NNS or their immunization paperwork . "" I VBP DT sounds alarming , "" says Tonya Ross , DT district 's director of nursing , but she points out IN conditional students in most NNS have received at least some of their immunizations and IN even if students receive CD measles shot — instead of DT recommended two — PRP still have 95 % immunity . Despite an outbreak of measles WDT began at nearby Disneyland , not a single case has appeared among students in DT district 's schools , she says . "" Even most of our students who have exemptions have some immunizations , "" she says . "" DT kids are for DT most part protected . "" Whether PRP — or any of DT NNS across DT country whose NN status is recorded as "" incomplete "" or "" conditional "" — ever VBP fully caught up on NNS is less clear . In Virginia , 104 schools have conditional entry rates above 10 % . Parents have 90 days to VB their NNS caught up , NN epidemiologist Sandra Sommer says . Sommer 's office does n't track or follow up on DT conditional enrollment figures provided by each school , she says . More than half DT schools with high conditional enrollment are in Northern Virginia 's Fairfax NN district , but only a "" low "" number of students have been taken out of school for failure to comply with DT law . Los Angeles school district officials MD n't say how JJ students had been taken out of school for not completing their vaccinations . "" DT 's always a last resort , "" Ross says . "" PRP VBP all kids to be in school . "" Epidemiologist Saad Omer of Emory University 's NNP Center VBD his research had shown IN JJ students who fall behind on immunizations never catch up . "" PRP do VB IN some parents eventually complete , but a majority of them do n't , "" he says . To look at DT issue of incomplete records , USA TODAY analyzed immunization data collected from more than 42,000 JJ and private schools in 25 NNS across DT country . Half DT NNS do n't require schools to report incomplete NNS — Massachusetts , Illinois , Minnesota , NNP York and Arizona are among those . Some track DT matter internally — Illinois law dictates IN each school must keep a list of all students who are n't fully vaccinated . In Arizona , NN law says students without proof of all vaccinations are required to stay home during outbreak incidents . This NN , unvaccinated students at two California high schools — in Huntington Beach and Palm Desert — were told to stay home after measles NNS were diagnosed . Starting in April , California 's Oakland Unified School district wo n't allow students to attend school unless PRP have all their NNS on file or have an exemption . DT district has 40 schools WDT had conditional entry rates over 10 % at DT beginning of DT school NN . Spokesman Troy Flint says those numbers are mostly because of untrained staff and spotty internal record keeping . Last week , DT district trained employees how to properly report and follow up on vaccinations . "" I 've seen this happen in schools where PRP do DT training , and DT NN rate goes from 20 % to 90 % , PRP was all just clerical error , "" he says . Ross says her district works to see IN students receive all their shots . School administrators pass pamphlets to parents about JJ NN and school - based clinics . In areas where students often do n't regularly see a doctor , school nurses host NN clinics . Nurses use DT NN 's immunization registry to check whether proof of immunization for students has ever been entered in another city .

Or should PRP be required only for school NNS , with a JJ exception allowed , and for groups IN front - line NN - care workers ? Some officials might VB few or no requirements at all because PRP VBP enough NNS will VB DT NN voluntarily or have immunity from an infection to halt DT spread of DT NN . But in NNS IN Oklahoma , efforts to require and promote DT NN MD run into strong headwinds . Anti-vaccine activists are vocal and influential in DT NN , spurred on by a national movement . PRP ’s CD reason Oklahoma is CD of only 15 NNS , including Texas and Arkansas , WDT allow parents to cite personal reasons to exempt their NNS from immunizations required by schools and day - care centers . PRP fill out and turn in a form . All NNS grant exemptions for JJ reasons , and 45 NNS plus Washington , D.C. , allow exemptions for religious objections . NN skeptics have successfully fought off efforts in DT Legislature and NN NN to tighten exemptions . Just this NN , a NN advisory committee proposed requiring parents who opt out of vaccinations for their NNS for religious or personal reasons to first attend a NN education session at their local NN department . PRP RB proposed IN exemptions expire after sixth grade unless parents renew them . Both failed to advance . A key reason driving proposals IN these is Oklahoma ’s rising numbers and rates of exemptions . In 2018 - CD , DT overall exemption rate for all kindergarteners was 2.6 % , up from 2.2 % in 2017 - 18 and 1.9 % in 2016 - 17 , according to DT Oklahoma NNP Department of NNP . In 2009 - 10 , DT exemption rate was 1.1 % . DT number of approved NN exemptions doubled from 2,417 in 2014 to 5,082 in 2019 . Liza Greve , executive director of DT Oklahomans for NNP and Parental Rights Foundation , a nonprofit WDT promotes what is often called NN choice or NN freedom , VBD she believes EX ’s a good chance Oklahoma will add a NN - CD NN to its NN schedule for NNS , and NN - care workers will be required to take PRP . But her organization will advocate for an individual ’s right to choose . “ Whatever shakes out , Oklahomans need to have a choice in NN and treatment , ” she VBD , citing concerns IN rapid development of a NN - CD NN will heighten risks of adverse reactions . Dr. Ervin Yen , an Oklahoma City anesthesiologist who advocated for stronger immunization policies during his four NNS in DT Oklahoma Senate , VBD he thinks DT federal NN should require DT NN for all citizens because of how deadly and contagious DT NN is . But he believes DT decision will be left up to DT NNS . “ I VBP a significant number of NNS will mandate PRP , and I VBP Oklahoma will have to consider PRP , ” Yen VBD . Oklahoma requires NNS entering school to be vaccinated for nine diseases , including measles , chickenpox and polio . Parents can apply for exemptions on JJ , religious or personal grounds . JJ exemptions represent DT smallest share of school exemptions in DT NN . House Majority Floor Leader Jon Echols , R - Oklahoma City , anticipates DT NN NN department MD update DT NN schedule for NNS to include NN - CD once a safe and effective NN is available and DT Legislature MD approve PRP as long as parents MD apply for DT same exemptions . “ I VBP PRP MD be widely used , ” Echols VBD . “ I MD take PRP . ” But a general requirement to be vaccinated MD not fly , Echols VBD . “ EX ’s no chance of DT Oklahoma Legislature passing a NNP ’s Republic of NNP mandate , ” he VBD . Nationwide nearly half DT NNPS require young adults be vaccinated against meningococcal NN before heading to college , and 15 NNS RB require DT hepatitis B NN . But unlike policies for NNS , few requirements exist for adult immunizations in DT U.S. and little JJ NN infrastructure supports mass NN of adults , according to DT National Conference of NNP Legislatures . Doctors and NNS say every NN has an adverse reaction rate . For DT measles NN , PRP is CD per 1 million NNS vaccinated , according to DT NNP NNP Organization . “ But PRP save 40 to 50 NNS ( per million ) from dying , ” Yen VBD . DT benefits of DT eventual NN - CD NN will “ hugely outweigh DT risks , ” he VBD . “ NN is way deadlier than measles . ” Even if DT death rate turns out to be only 1 % , a NN given to 1 million NNS MD save 10,000 lives , Yen VBD . NNS across DT globe are fast - tracking development of a NN - CD NN , with 118 candidate NNS in DT works , DT NNP NNP Organization reports . Of those , eight are in clinical or human trials and 110 are not yet being tested on humans . PRP ’s not clear when a safe and effective NN MD be developed and available for distribution . Predictions have ranged from 12 or 18 months to at least a few NNS out , and residents in developed NNS , or ones WDT originate a successful NN , MD gain NN immunity first , while more impoverished NNS wait . DT U.S. Food and Drug Administration is streamlining its processes for NN NNS and therapeutic treatments . “ DT FDA is VBG to rush PRP through , ” VBD William Hildebrand , a research professor at DT University of Oklahoma College of Medicine who is among DT JJ NNS worldwide working to create a NN . “ DT NN is demanding PRP . ” Hildebrand ’s team is looking at using DT body ’s protective T - cells to find and kill NN - infected cells , rather than developing a NN WDT helps DT body produce antibodies . PRP ’s a long shot , he VBD . “ Everybody ’s odds are a little long ( individually ) , but collectively our odds are pretty good , ” Hildebrand VBD . “ DT odds are pretty good DT scientific community is VBG to come up with something WDT will stop this NN . ” For a NN to stop DT spread of an infectious NN , a sufficiently high number of NNS must be immune to DT NN . DT provides indirect protection , or herd immunity , to those who are n’t vaccinated or who have compromised immune systems and are at greater risk of catching an infection , including babies , older adults or NNS with certain JJ conditions . Herd immunity for each NN is based on how JJ additional NNS each infected person will cause during their infectious period . CD person with measles , for example , will infect 12 to 18 others , so , based on a complex calculation , 90 % of DT population needs to be vaccinated to ensure DT NN does not spread . In DT case of NNP - CD , DT NN shows an infected person will pass PRP along to about three others , meaning about 70 % of DT population will need to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity , VBD Gary Raskob , dean of DT OU College of NNP NNP . An analysis by DT Journal of Infection in mid-March estimated IN DT percentage of a population WDT must be immune via NN or natural immunity to halt DT spread of NN - CD varies by country . In Kuwait , PRP ’s less than 6 % ; in Japan , 33 % , and in Spain , 81 % . DT percentages are based on R - naught values , DT epidemiological number for DT reproduction rate of DT NN . “ DT NN will be crucial , ” Raskob VBD . “ PRP have to VB DT NN to understand DT importance of NN . ” JJ acceptance likely will be better than for DT measles NN , he VBD . “ Since measles was eradicated , JJ NNS have never seen a case of measles , even most physicians practicing today , ” Raskob VBD . Not so with NNP - CD . NNS are reminded daily of DT severe and fatal effects of DT NN and JJ NNS have personal experience with PRP . NNS are likely to be waiting in line as production scales up once DT FDA approves a NN , he VBD . If EX ’s not enough NN to meet DT initial demand , PRP MD likely VB first to NN - care workers and then DT most vulnerable population , Raskob VBD . Hospitals and long - term care facilities will have DT ability to require IN employees be vaccinated over any personal objections , he VBD . Oklahoma law currently requires hospital employees to provide documentation of immunity to measles , mumps , rubella and varicella . Several hospitals have adopted DT Oklahoma Hospital Association policy WDT supports mandatory employee influenza vaccinations as a condition of employment in hospitals . ‘ PRP Have to Proceed With Caution ’ Amid DT quest for a NN NN , suspicion gathers among networks and groups WDT object to JJ proven NNS and NN requirements . A NN published this week in DT NN journal Nature found nearly 100 million NNS expressing views on NN on Facebook and concluded DT explosive growth in anti-vaccination views MD increase opposition to a future NN NN and “ amplify outbreaks , as happened for measles in 2019 . ” DT Oklahomans for NNP and Parental Rights political action committee , which contributes to NN legislative campaigns , says NNS have been linked to chronic childhood conditions , including NN , asthma , diabetes and obesity . Claims IN these are made by other anti-vaccination groups despite research to DT contrary showing NNS are generally safe . Greve , who leads DT PAC as well as DT nonprofit advocacy group , VBD supporters are following DT NN - CD NN NN and keeping an eye on safety and efficacy studies . “ Sometimes in an emergency situation , corners are cut when PRP should n’t be , ” Greve VBD . “ DT evolving NN is moving very quickly . When PRP comes to a NN , PRP have to proceed with caution . ” CD concern is DT risk of immune enhancement , in which a NN actually weakens a person ’s response to DT NN so DT person becomes sicker , Greve VBD . An example occurred when an investigational NN against respiratory syncytial NN ( RSV ) backfired in DT 1960s . In CD NN , DT hospitalization rate of infants who were vaccinated approached 80 % compared to 5 % for those not vaccinated , and two toddlers died , according to DT National Institutes of NNP ’s National Library of Medicine . Greve ’s advocacy group supported a dozen NN - related bills filed this legislative session , including efforts to protect personal exemptions and establish a stronger tracking system for reporting any injuries or deaths from vaccinations . Hildebrand , of DT OU College of Medicine , VBD multiple studies are underway to provide DT answers NNS need to develop an effective NN - CD NN in record NN . He VBD DT rush to discover a NN means DT result MD carry a greater risk of serious reaction than normal . “ This NN might be more relaxed or liberal in its acceptable adverse reaction rate , ” he VBD . When DT NN is available , he VBD , NNS will have to ask themselves what ’s riskier , DT odds of an adverse reaction or DT danger of getting DT NN .

CD way for leaders to earn their followers ’ trust in a crisis is through self sacrifice–either through their own giving or DT of DT organization . DT author ’s research shows IN when leaders sacrifice in this way , PRP makes employees feel more positively toward them and more committed to their organizations . But to reap DT benefits , leaders must give with purpose , and be transparent about why and how much PRP are giving . PRP might VB IN crises tend to bring out DT worst in NNS , but DT is n’t reflected in how PRP view our leaders , at least . In fact , crises cause PRP to view leaders as more charismatic and effective than PRP normally do . This is probably why U.S. presidents are almost universally re-elected in times of war . And research has shown IN leaders who self - sacrifice tend to be seen as DT most effective . Following 9/11 , I was so intrigued by crisis leadership IN I did a NN on DT topic . In my research I found IN leader self - sacrifice , such as cutting PRP ’s own salary or giving up PRP ’s own benefits , caused employees to feel more positively toward their leaders and more committed to their organizations during crises . This finding has been corroborated by additional research in DT lab and field WDT suggests IN when leaders demonstrate self - sacrificial behavior , PRP makes PRP see them as having higher moral values and as being a better role model — leading to better organizational outcomes . More recently , PRP have seen CEOs step up to support their employees during this pandemic by pledging not to lay off employees — even those who can not VB into work . For example , even though all of Patagonia ’s stores are closed , CEO Yvon Chouinard has announced IN DT company will continue to pay all employees , leading some to conclude IN DT values - driven organization will survive DT pandemic while other organizations will fail . Other CEOs who have committed to no layoffs include Hearst CEO Steven Swartz , LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner , Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey , Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman , Citigroup CEO Mike Corbat , Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan , Visa CEO Alfred F. Kelly Jr. , and FedEx CEO Frederick Smith , Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins . So , what can leaders do in this NN to support their employees and how can PRP be sure IN their giving hits DT mark ? Effective measures fall into three categories : taking some of DT same hits as your staff ; giving with a larger purpose in mind ; and being aggressively transparent even when PRP ’s hard . Self - sacrifice is not just about DT company doing what ’s right . If PRP are VBG to ask your employees to sacrifice , PRP need to sacrifice as well . If PRP expect your team to behave safely , PRP as a leader should behave safely . If PRP expect your team to VB down in DT trenches , PRP should be down RB with them . No NN likes DT leader who throws their team on DT front line while PRP sit in their office . Marriott International CEO Arne Sorenson , forfeited his salary for DT NN and is donating hotel rooms to front - line workers to help fight NNP - CD . Marriot RB asked its executives to sacrifice half of their salaries and has been furloughed JJ other employees . As a result , Marriot is still viewed – at least in DT NN — as an employer of choice despite its need to furlough employees . Other companies whose top leaders have cut their salaries include NBCUniversal , Uber , Delta , and Yelp . In my own field of academia , highly paid deans , coaches , and administrators at top universities IN Harvard are taking pay cuts to help make up for DT impending deficits WDT higher education is facing . Even NN leaders , IN Jacinda Arden , NNP Zealand ’s prime minister , are taking pay cuts . Not all of PRP are CEOs who can make DT decision to keep NNS ’s paychecks coming or give up our salary for a NN . But EX are still ways to sacrifice for our employees . Small gestures IN ordering lunch to be sent remotely to your employees for a team zoom meeting can VB a long way at maintaining DT morale of DT team . If your organization has a leave donation program , PRP can donate some of your NN off to your team members who need PRP . When PRP ’re a leader , sacrificing along with your employees MD mean IN PRP will be more committed to staying with DT company during and after DT crisis . And , considering DT cost of employee turnover , this MD mean DT difference between recovering from DT NNP - CD crisis — or not . JJ organizations are offering free services IN free virtual tours or free learning tools for kids . Likewise , PRP have seen organizations step up to help provide resources needed to combat DT effects of DT pandemic . Tesla , Toyota , Ford and GM have shut down factories to make ventilators while Medtronic openly shared DT software and specifications for their portable ventilators , allowing anyone to use them for free to help create ventilators in response to NNP - CD . But , whatever DT give , PRP is important to tie DT sacrifice to vision , mission , and DT values of your organization so IN NNS can understand why PRP are doing PRP . When Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff pledged not to do any layoffs for DT next three months , he tied PRP to DT cultural value of Ohana ( family ) and giving , asking IN employees RB continue to support DT NNS PRP relied on before DT crisis , such as house cleaners or dog walkers . Leaders should be clear about how their actions are consistent with DT organization ’s values . If DT purpose is n’t clear , EX can be backlash . Research shows IN PRP are a skeptical bunch and when leaders self - sacrifice , PRP try to infer why DT leader might be doing PRP or focus on what PRP are not doing ( IN whether or not DT leaders are keeping their bonuses ) . DT more cynical among PRP might infer IN Johnson & Johnson ’s decision to invest a billion dollars to develop a NNP - CD NN was driven by profit . But , when CEO Alex Gorsky tied DT act to their responsibility to improve DT NN of NNS and PRP announced IN PRP MD provide DT NN on a not - for - profit basis , DT doubt turns to admiration . In addition to explaining why PRP are making a sacrifice , leaders should be transparent about what DT sacrifice amounts to . If a leader publicly donates 10 % of her salary to a nonprofit , she should explain what DT nonprofit is and what exactly is happening to DT money . For example , Jack Dorsey is donating $ 1 billion of his Square equity ( 28 % of his wealth ) to fund NNP - CD relief . Not only is he giving away DT money ; he RB shared a Google Doc showing how DT funds MD be spent . Voluntary transparency becomes key in this situation . Disney ’s CEO Bob Chapek is forgoing 50 % of his salary and other benefits as a result of NNP - CD . But this decision came after pressure from DT union for some information from leadership over concerns about DT closing of Disney parks . Even when PRP are not in a crisis , 84 % of employees VBP organizations are not doing enough to create transparency . But this comes at a cost to DT organization . CD NN showed IN organizations WDT were more transparent had higher productivity , innovation , and retention than those WDT were more opaque . In contrast , increasing transparency can in fact build trust . Crises create DT opportunity for leaders to provide direction , meaning , and support when followers need PRP DT most . Learning IN Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle reduced his salary to $ 10,000 while continuing to pay its employees or IN Yum Brands CEO , David Gibbs , gave up his salary and gave $ 1,000 bonuses to DT managers of his restaurants does more than lift DT spirits of their employees . These various strains of research indicate IN this type of sacrifice can improve morale and trust for DT rest of PRP , and ease DT pain DT rest of PRP are feeling in this NN ."

DT ’s surprisingly low considering DT effort VBG into DT JJ race for a NN against DT NN WDT has sparked a pandemic since PRP emerged from NNP late last NN . But more NNS might eventually roll up their sleeves : DT poll , released Wednesday , found 31 % simply were n’t sure if PRP ’d VB vaccinated . Another 1 in 5 VBD PRP ’d refuse . NN experts already worry about DT whiplash if NN promises IN NNP Donald NNP ’s goal of a 300 million - dose stockpile by January fail . Only NN and NN will tell – and DT JJ poll shows DT NN is indeed skeptical . “ PRP ’s always better to underpromise and overdeliver , ” VBD Dr. William Schaffner , an infectious NN specialist at Vanderbilt University NNP Center . “ DT unexpected looms large and DT ’s why I VBP for any of these NNS , PRP ’re VBG to need a large safety database to provide DT reassurance , ” he added . NN live updates : Food prices poised to jump ; half of Americans not sure PRP VBP NN ; NNP deaths near 100K Among Americans who say PRP MD n’t VB vaccinated , 7 in 10 worry about safety . “ I am not an anti-vaxxer , ” VBD Melanie Dries , 56 , of Colorado Springs , Colorado . But “ to VB a NN - CD NN within a NN or two ... causes me to fear IN PRP wo n’t be widely tested as to side effects . ” Dr. Francis Collins , who directs DT National Institutes of NNP , insists safety is DT top priority . DT NIH is creating a master plan for testing DT leading NNP - CD NN candidates in tens of thousands of NNS , to prove whether PRP work and whether PRP ’re safe . “ I MD not VB NNS to VB IN PRP ’re cutting corners , because DT MD be a big mistake . I VBP this is an effort to try to achieve efficiencies , but not to sacrifice rigor , ” Collins told DT AP earlier this month . “ Definitely DT worst thing WDT MD happen is if PRP rush through a NN WDT turns out to have significant side effects , ” Collins added . Among those who VBP a NN , DT AP - NORC poll found protecting themselves , their family and DT community are DT top reasons . “ I ’m definitely VBG to VB PRP , ” VBD Brandon Grimes , 35 , of Austin , Texas . “ As a father who takes care of his family , I VBP ... PRP ’s important for me to VB vaccinated as soon as PRP ’s available to better protect my family . ” Poll : 4 in 10 concerned about getting NN - CD from NN shot And about 7 in 10 of those who MD VB vaccinated say life wo n’t VB back to normal without a NN . A site foreman for his family ’s construction business , Grimes travels from house to house interacting with different crews , and VBD some of his co-workers RB are looking forward to NN to minimize on - DT - job risk . DT JJ NN is most dangerous to older adults and NNS of any age who have chronic NN problems such as diabetes or heart NN . DT poll found 67 % of NNS 60 and older say PRP ’d VB vaccinated , compared with 40 % who are younger . And death counts suggest black and Hispanic Americans are more vulnerable to NN - CD , because of unequal access to NN care and other factors . Yet DT poll found just 25 % of African Americans and 37 % of Hispanics MD VB a NN compared to 56 % of whites . Among NNS who do n’t VB a NN , about 4 in 10 say PRP ’re concerned about catching NN - CD from DT shot . But most of DT leading NN candidates do n’t contain DT NN itself , meaning PRP can’t cause infection . And 3 in 10 who do n’t VB a NN do n’t fear getting seriously ill from DT NN . More than 5.5 million NNS worldwide have been confirmed infected by DT NN , and more than 340,000 deaths have been recorded , including nearly 100,000 in DT U.S. , according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University . Experts believe DT true toll is significantly higher . And while most NNS who VBP NNP - CD have mild NNS and recover , doctors still are discovering DT NN attacks in far sneakier ways than just causing pneumonia – from blood clots to heart and kidney damage to DT latest scare , a life - threatening inflammatory reaction in NNS . Whatever DT final statistics show about how often PRP kills , NN specialists agree DT JJ NN appears deadlier than DT typical NN . Yet DT survey suggests a NN MD be no more popular than DT yearly NN shot . Worldwide , about a dozen NN - CD NN candidates are in early stages of testing or poised to begin . British researchers are opening CD of DT biggest studies so far , to test an Oxford University - created shot in 10,000 NNS . For all DT promises of DT NNP administration ’s Operation Warp Speed , only 20 % of Americans expect any NN to be available to DT NN by NN ’s end , DT poll found . Most VBP sometime next NN is more likely . Political divisions seen over how DT country reopens DT economy are reflected in desire for a NN , too . More than half of Democrats call a NN necessary for reopening , compared with about a third of Republicans . While 62 % of Democrats MD VB DT NN , only 43 % of Republicans say DT same . “ EX ’s still a large amount of uncertainty around taking DT NN , ” VBD Caitlin Oppenheimer , who leads NORC ’s JJ NN research . “ EX is a lot of opportunity to communicate with Americans about DT value and DT safety of a NN . ” DT AP - NORC poll of 1,056 adults was conducted NNP 14 - 18 using a sample drawn from NORC ’s probability - based AmeriSpeak Panel , which is designed to be representative of DT U.S. population . DT margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points .

DT quest to combat a deadly pandemic is exposing bottlenecks in DT pharmaceutical supply chain . DT NN has neither enough glass vials to house DT NN nor DT facility capacity to fill and package them , experts say . "" DT demand is VBG to far outstrip DT supply , "" Vijay Kumar , an Evercore analyst who focuses on DT JJ device and life sciences sectors , told CNN Business in an interview . DT NNP - CD pandemic has consistently shown what happens when supply chains are blindsided by spikes and drop - offs in demand and how an unexpected bottleneck can affect DT integrity of DT entire system . DT NNP is coming up short in acquiring "" basic but critical "" supplies to administer a NN NN , VBD Rick Bright , DT former director of DT Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority , in his whistleblower complaint in NNP . He VBD IN Strategic National Stockpile has only 2 % of DT 650 million to 850 million needles and syringes needed and IN officials are n't addressing DT JJ shortage of glass vials . "" PRP MD take up to two NNS to produce enough vials for NNP NN needs , while some therapeutics will RB require vials , "" Bright VBD , according to DT complaint . Using DT entire current inventory of vials for a NN - CD NN is n't reasonable because PRP MD create supply woes for ongoing needs such as DT annual NN and kids ' vaccinations , Evercore 's Kumar VBD . DT pharmaceutical industry started NNP - CD in a tight spot from a packaging perspective , as a JJ glass shortage was just starting to even out , he VBD . JJ glass is n't made from your typical beach sand , and DT vials are n't your everyday soda - lime glass found in JJ household items . "" Glass shortage stems from sand shortage : EX are [ fewer than ] 1,000 sand mines in DT NNP , "" Kumar and Evercore colleagues wrote in an April 26 research note . "" Desert sand is too smooth to use for glass ; most [ quartz ] sand comes from rivers , and mining PRP can have ecological and infrastructure consequences . "" Pharmaceutical firms are exploring and devising workarounds WDT include packing a few doses into larger vials versus single - dose vials . DT move saves on bottles , but PRP drastically raises DT chances of DT NN VBG to waste , VBD Prashant Yadav , a healthcare supply chain expert and senior fellow at DT Center for NNP Development . Multiple dose vials MD RB raise NN risks if PRP 're used improperly , notably via reuse of needles , VBD Jay Walker , VBD chief executive officer and chairman of ApiJect Systems , which makes pre-filled syringes . ApiJect , a JJ benefit corporation , has been CD of DT companies tapped in recent weeks to help address potential supply chain challenges -- notably DT vial shortage as well as DT capacity constraints in filling and packaging DT vials . DT process is complex in nature , costly , and takes NN to build because PRP requires precision and regulatory scrutiny to ensure quality and safety . , out of an authorized total of in which sterile plastic containers are created , filled and sealed in a matter of seconds . ApiJect 's system is expected to produce about 500 of DT pre-filled syringes every minute . In March , ApiJect was awarded $ 10 million by DT NNP Department of NNP and Human Servicesout of an authorized total of $ 456 million , in addition to a more recent award of $ 138 million from DT NNP Department of Defense to research , develop and produce more than 100 million of DT pre-filled syringes by NN 's end . DT syringes are made via a manufacturing processin which sterile plastic containers are created , filled and sealed in a matter of seconds . ApiJect 's system is expected to produce about 500 of DT pre-filled syringes every minute . DT product serves as an alternative to traditional glass vials for NN distribution . DT money will RB VB toward DT retrofitting of existing manufacturing facilities with a goal of producing more than 500 million of DT pre-filled syringes in 2021 . By 2022 , DT goal is to have a production capacity of 330 million finished units per month , an HHS spokesperson told CNN Business . "" PRP 're part of DT answer , but PRP 're not DT whole answer , "" ApiJect 's Walker VBD .

Doctors associate them with DT common cold , bronchitis , pneumonia , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) , and NN NN 2019 ( NNP - CD ) . These viruses can RB affect DT gut . Coronaviruses usually cause DT common cold , though PRP can be responsible for more severe illnesses . Over DT past 80 NNS , NNS have found IN these viruses can infect mice , rats , dogs , cats , turkeys , horses , pigs , and cattle . Sometimes , these animals transmit DT viruses to humans . Most recently , authorities identified a JJ NN outbreak in NNP WDT has now reached other NNS . DT NN is called severe acute respiratory syndrome NN 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) and PRP can cause NN - CD . In this article , PRP explain DT different types of human NN , their symptoms , and how NNS transmit them . PRP RB focus on three particularly dangerous diseases caused by coronaviruses : NNP - CD , SARS , and Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) . Stay informed with live updates on DT current NN - CD outbreak and visit our NN hub for more advice on prevention and treatment . Covering DT mouth when sneezing can help stop DT spread of coronaviruses . Researchers first identified a NN in 1937 , isolating CD WDT was responsible for a type of bronchitis in birds WDT had DT potential to devastate poultry stocks . NNS found evidence of human coronaviruses in DT 1960s , in DT noses of NNS with DT common cold . Human coronaviruses WDT are particularly prevalent include 229E , NL63 , OC43 , and HKU1 . DT name “ NN ” comes from DT crown - JJ projections on their surfaces . “ Corona ” in Latin means “ halo ” or “ crown . ” Among humans , NN infections most often occur during DT winter months and early spring . In 2019 , DT Centers for NNP Control and Prevention ( CDC ) started monitoring DT outbreak of a JJ NN , SARS - CoV - 2 , which causes NN - CD . Authorities first identified DT NN in Wuhan , NNP . Since then , DT NN has spread to nearly every country , leading DT NNP NNP Organization ( WHO ) to declare a pandemic . DT JJ NN has been responsible for millions of infections globally , causing hundreds of thousands of deaths . DT NNP NNPS has seen DT highest number of these deaths . DT first NNS with NNP - CD had links to an animal and seafood market . This suggests IN animals initially transmitted DT NN to humans . Then , NNS with no connections to DT market developed DT NN , confirming IN humans can pass DT NN to each other . Most NNS who VBP NN - CD will have a mild form of DT NN . According to DT WHO , around 80 % of NNS who VBP NN - CD will recover without needing hospitalization . DT remaining 20 % become seriously ill and develop difficulty breathing . Some groups are more at risk of severe NN , including older adults and NNS with underlying JJ concerns , including high blood pressure , heart and lung problems , diabetes , and cancer . DT mortality rate varies between NNS . In DT U.S. , DT death rate is around 6 % . According to DT CDC , NNS are not at higher risk of NN - CD than adults . Pregnant women appear to have DT same risk of NN - CD as other adults . However , during pregnancy , women have a higher risk of severe illness from viruses WDT are similar to SARS - CoV - 2 and influenza . DT CDC RB recommend IN infants born to women with suspected or confirmed NN - CD are put into isolation . According to DT CDC , NNS MD start to experience symptoms 2 – 14 days after exposure to DT NN . Symptoms MD include : • JJ loss of taste or smell No NN is currently available for NNP - CD . However , NNS have now replicated DT NN . This MD allow for early detection and treatment in NNS who have DT NN but are not experiencing symptoms . According to DT CDC , DT following groups have a higher risk of developing serious illness from NN - CD : • NNS of any age who have serious underlying JJ conditions , including chronic lung NN , serious heart conditions , severe obesity , a compromised immune system , or diabetes DT CDC note IN although EX have been reports of complications in young NNS , these are rare . NNP - CD most commonly produces mild symptoms in NNS . Cold - or NN - JJ symptoms usually set in around 2 – 4 days after DT infection develops . Typically , DT symptoms are mild , though PRP vary from person to person . In some NNS , NN infections are fatal . While NNS can easily cultivate rhinoviruses — which RB cause DT common cold — in DT laboratory , this is not DT case with coronaviruses . This makes PRP difficult to gauge DT impact of these pathogens . EX is currently no cure for DT cold - JJ illnesses caused by coronaviruses . Treatments include self - care and over - DT - counter medications . Taking DT following steps MD help : A doctor can identify DT NN responsible in a sample of fluid from a person ’s body , such as a sample of blood or mucus from DT nose . Coronaviruses belong to DT subfamily Coronavirinae in DT family Coronaviridae . Different types of NN vary , in terms of DT severity of NN WDT PRP cause and how far PRP spread . Doctors currently recognize seven types of NN WDT can infect humans . Rarer strains WDT cause more severe illnesses include MERS - CoV , which causes DT NN MERS , and SARS - CoV , DT NN responsible for SARS . In 2019 , a JJ strain , called SARS - CoV - 2 , started circulating , causing DT NN NN - CD . DT CDC recommend IN all NNS wear cloth face masks in JJ places where PRP is difficult to maintain a 6 - foot ( 2 - meter ) distance from others . This will help slow DT spread of DT NN from asymptomatic NNS and NNS who do not VB IN PRP have contracted PRP . NNS should wear cloth face masks while continuing to practice physical distancing . Instructions for making masks at home are available here . Note : PRP is critical IN surgical masks and N95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers . Researchers believe IN DT viruses transmit via fluids in DT respiratory system , such as mucus . For example , a NN can spread when a person : • coughs or sneezes without covering their mouth , dispersing droplets into DT air • touches someone who has DT infection • touches a surface WDT has DT NN , then touches their own nose , eyes , or mouth Some animal coronaviruses MD spread to humans through contact with feces , though PRP is unclear whether human coronaviruses can spread in DT same way . Coronaviruses will infect most NNS at some point . To prevent transmission , NNS with symptoms should stay at home , rest , and avoid coming into close contact with other NNS . Covering DT mouth and nose with a tissue or handkerchief while coughing or sneezing can RB help prevent transmission . PRP is important to dispose of used tissues right away and maintain proper hygiene around DT home . MERS is caused by DT MERS - CoV NN . NNS first recognized this severe respiratory illness in 2012 after PRP surfaced in Saudi Arabia . Since then , PRP has spread to other NNS . DT NN has reached DT U.S. However , only two NNS in DT country have tested positive for MERS - CoV , and this was in 2014 . As a result , DT CDC VBP IN DT risk of developing MERS in DT U.S. is very low . Symptoms of MERS include a fever , breathlessness , and coughing . DT illness spreads through close contact with NNS who have DT infection . A 2019 investigation into MERS found IN DT NN is fatal in 35.2 % of NNS who develop PRP . Keep up to date on DT current NN - CD outbreak . DT CDC have RB a resource on reducing DT risk of infection ."

DT NN ’s prediction contrasts with testimony heard on Capitol Hill shortly before NNP spoke on DT White House South Lawn . DT ousted director of DT federal NN ’s NN agency told lawmakers , “ PRP do n’t have a plan ” to mass - produce and distribute a NN NN . Hope for such a NN within 12 to 18 months assumes "" everything goes perfectly , ” Dr. Rick Bright testified . "" PRP 've never seen everything VB perfectly . ” More than 90 NNS for DT novel NN are in development around DT NN .

Bright was removed as DT director of DT Biomedical Advance Research and Development Authority ( BARDA ) , which is under DT Department of NNP and Human Services , an action WDT prompted DT immunologist to file a whistleblower complaint . NNP told reporters he watched some of Thursday ’s testimony by Bright and “ he looks IN an angry , disgruntled employee who , frankly , according to some NNS , did n't do a very good job . ” Bright told a House NN subcommittee IN higher officials , including those at DT White House , ignored his early warning about NNP - CD , and DT federal NN was ill - prepared to respond to a pandemic . DT current administration blames any shortcomings on plans and supplies left by DT previous administration of Barack Obama , who turned DT presidency over to NNP in January 2017 . White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany VBD this MD be explained “ line by line ” in a briefing for reporters on Friday . DT NN , prior to visiting a JJ supply distributor in Pennsylvania , returned to his previous controversial promotion of an unproven malaria drug for treatment of DT novel NN . “ PRP ’ve had tremendous response to DT hydroxy ( chloroquine ) , ” asserted NNP , who RB criticized Bright for “ fighting PRP ” when he was running BARDA . Bright and others cautioned about DT need for scientific studies about using DT drug for NN - CD treatment and warned of its dangers , including DT possibility PRP MD kill NNS . Asked by a reporter if DT Centers for NNP Control and Prevention is over - counting U.S. deaths from DT NN , NNP replied , “ I do n't VB how PRP 're counting . I never discussed PRP with them . Death is death . PRP do n't VB NNS dying in this country . And PRP 've done a great job . ” DT NNP NNPS has recorded DT most deaths and most NN - CD NNS of any country . As of Thursday afternoon EDT , according to records compiled by Johns Hopkins University , 1.4 million NNS had tested positive for DT NN and more than 85,000 had died in DT country . At a Thursday afternoon event , partly resembling a campaign rally , at a JJ supply distribution company in DT election battleground NN of Pennsylvania , DT NN promoted DT replenishment of DT strategic national stockpile . NNP linked DT high rate of NN - CD NNS in DT NNP NNPS to DT country 's having conducted DT most tests . “ When PRP test , PRP have a case , ” DT NN VBD . “ If PRP did n’t do any testing , PRP MD have very few NNS . ”"

Learn more about DT symptoms of measles , how PRP spreads , and how PRP can be prevented . Measles is caused by infection with a NN from DT paramyxovirus family . Viruses are tiny parasitic microbes . Once PRP ’ve been infected , DT NN invades host cells and uses cellular components to complete its life cycle . DT measles NN infects DT respiratory tract first . However , PRP eventually spreads to other parts of DT body through DT bloodstream . Measles is only known to occur in humans and not in other animals . EX are known genetic types of measles , although only 6 are currently circulating . Measles can be spread through DT air from respiratory droplets and small aerosol particles . An infected person can release DT NN into DT air when PRP cough or sneeze . These respiratory particles can RB settle on objects and surfaces . PRP can become infected if PRP come into contact with a contaminated object , such as a door handle , and then touch your face , nose , or mouth . DT measles NN can live outside of DT body for longer than PRP MD VB . In fact , PRP can remain infectious in DT air or on surfaces for up to . Measles is highly contagious . This means IN DT infection can spread very easily from person to person . A susceptible person WDT ’s exposed to DT measles NN has a 90 percent chance of becoming infected . Additionally , an infected person can VB on to spread DT NN to anywhere between 9 and 18 susceptible individuals . A person WDT has measles can spread DT NN to others before PRP even VBP IN PRP have PRP . An infected person is contagious for four days before DT characteristic rash appears . After DT rash appears , PRP ’re still contagious for another four days . DT main risk factor for catching measles is being unvaccinated . Additionally , some groups are at a higher risk of developing complications from measles infection , including young NNS , NNS with a weakened immune system , and pregnant women . If PRP suspect IN PRP have measles or have been exposed to someone with measles , contact your doctor immediately . PRP can evaluate PRP and direct PRP where to be seen to determine if PRP have DT infection . Doctors can confirm measles by examining your skin rash and checking for symptoms WDT are characteristic of DT NN , such as white spots in DT mouth , fever , cough , and sore throat . If PRP suspect PRP MD have measles based on your history and observation , your doctor will order a blood test to check for DT measles NN . EX ’s no specific treatment for measles . Unlike bacterial infections , viral infections are n’t sensitive to antibiotics . DT NN and symptoms typically disappear in about two or three weeks . EX are some interventions available for NNS who MD have been exposed to DT NN . These can help prevent an infection or lessen its severity . PRP include : • a measles NN , given within 72 hours of exposure • a dose of immune proteins called immunoglobulin , taken within six days of exposure Your doctor MD recommend DT following to help PRP recover : • rest to help boost your immune system Although PRP ’s often associated with childhood illness , adults can VB measles too . NNS who are n’t vaccinated are at a higher risk of catching DT NN . PRP ’s generally accepted IN adults born during or before 1957 are naturally immune to measles . This is because DT NN was first licensed in 1963 . Before then , most NNS had been naturally exposed to DT infection by their adolescent NNS and became immune as a result . According to DT , serious complications are not only more common in young NNS , but RB in adults over DT age of 20 . These complications can include things IN pneumonia , encephalitis , and blindness . If PRP ’re an adult who has n’t been vaccinated or is n’t sure of their NN status , PRP should see your doctor to receive DT NN . At least CD dose of DT NN is recommended for unvaccinated adults . DT measles NN is n’t given to NNS until PRP ’re at least 12 months old . Before receiving their first dose of DT NN is DT NN PRP ’re most vulnerable to being infected with DT measles NN . Babies receive some protection from measles through passive immunity , which is provided from mother to child through DT placenta and during breastfeeding . However , has shown IN this immunity can be lost in just over 2.5 months after birth or DT NN breastfeeding is discontinued . NNS under 5 NNS of age are more likely to have complications due to measles . These can include things IN pneumonia , encephalitis , and ear infections WDT can result in hearing loss . DT incubation period of an infectious NN is DT NN WDT passes between exposure and when symptoms develop . DT incubation period for measles is between 10 and 14 days . After DT initial incubation period , PRP MD begin to experience nonspecific symptoms , such as fever , cough , and runny nose . DT rash will begin to develop several days later . PRP ’s important to remember IN PRP can still spread DT infection to others for four days prior to developing DT rash . If PRP VBP PRP ’ve been exposed to measles and have n’t been vaccinated , PRP should contact your doctor as soon as possible . In addition to a classic measles infection , EX are RB several other types of measles infections WDT PRP can VB . Atypical measles occurs in NNS who received a killed measles NN between 1963 and 1967 . When exposed to measles , these individuals come down with an illness WDT has symptoms such as high fever , rash , and sometimes pneumonia . Modified measles occurs in NNS who ’ve been given post - exposure immunoglobulin and in infants who still have some passive immunity . Modified measles is typically milder than a regular case of measles . Hemorrhagic measles is rarely reported in DT NNP NNPS . PRP causes symptoms IN high fever , seizures , and bleeding into DT skin and mucus membranes . PRP MD have heard rubella referred to as “ German measles . ” But measles and rubella are actually caused by two different viruses . Rubella is n’t as contagious as measles . However , PRP can cause serious complications if a woman develops DT infection while pregnant . Even though different viruses cause measles and rubella , PRP ’re RB similar in several ways . Both viruses : • can be spread through DT air from coughing and sneezing Both measles and rubella are included in DT measles - mumps - rubella ( MMR ) and measles - mumps - rubella - varicella ( MMRV ) NNS . EX a few ways to prevent becoming ill with measles . Getting vaccinated is DT best way to prevent measles . Two doses of DT measles NN are effective at preventing measles infection . EX are two NNS available — DT MMR NN and DT MMRV NN . DT MMR NN is a three - in - CD NN WDT can protect PRP from measles , mumps , and rubella . DT MMRV NN protects against DT same infections as DT MMR NN and RB includes protection against chickenpox . NNS can receive their first NN at 12 months , or sooner if traveling internationally , and their second dose between DT ages of 4 and 6 . Adults who have never received an immunization can request DT NN from their doctor . Some groups should n’t receive a NN against measles . These groups include : • NNS who ’ve had a previous life - threatening reaction to DT measles NN or its components • immunocompromised individuals , which can include NNS with HIV or AIDS , NNS undergoing cancer treatment , or NNS on medications WDT suppress DT immune system Side effects to NN are typically mild and disappear in a few days . PRP can include things IN fever and mild rash . In rare NNS , DT NN has been linked to low platelet count or seizures . Most NNS and adults who receive a measles NN do n’t experience side effects . Some believe IN DT measles NN can cause NN in NNS . As a result , an intense amount of NN has been devoted to this topic over JJ NNS . This research has found IN EX is between NNS and NN . NN is n’t just important for protecting PRP and your family . PRP ’s RB important for protecting NNS who ca n’t be vaccinated . When more NNS are vaccinated against a NN , PRP ’s less likely to circulate within DT population . This is called herd immunity . To achieve herd immunity against measles , approximately of DT population must be vaccinated . Not everyone can receive DT measles NN . But EX are other ways IN PRP can help to prevent DT spread of measles . • Practice good hand hygiene . Wash your hands before eating , after using DT bathroom , and before touching your face , mouth , or nose . • Do n’t share personal items with NNS who MD be ill . This can include things IN eating utensils , drinking glasses , and toothbrushes . • Avoid coming into contact with NNS who are sick • Stay home from work or school and other JJ places until PRP are n’t contagious . This is four days after PRP first develop DT measles rash . • Avoid contact with NNS who MD be vulnerable to infection , such as infants too young to be vaccinated and immunocompromised NNS . • Cover your nose and mouth if PRP need to cough or sneeze . Dispose of all used tissues promptly . If PRP do n’t have a tissue available , sneeze into DT crook of your elbow , not into your hand . • Be sure to wash your hands frequently and to disinfect any surfaces or objects WDT PRP touch frequently . Pregnant women who do n’t have immunity to measles should take care to avoid exposure during their pregnancy . Coming down with measles during your pregnancy can have significant negative NN effects on both DT mother and fetus . Pregnant women are at an increased risk for complications from measles such as pneumonia . Additionally , having measles while pregnant can lead to DT following pregnancy complications : Measles can RB be transmitted from mother to child if DT mother has measles close to her delivery date . This is called congenital measles . Babies with congenital measles have a rash after birth or develop CD shortly afterward . PRP ’re at an increased risk of complications , which can be life - threatening . If PRP ’re pregnant , do n’t have immunity to measles , and believe IN PRP ’ve been exposed , PRP should contact your doctor immediately . Receiving an injection of immunoglobulin MD help to prevent an infection . Measles has a low death rate in healthy NNS and adults , and most NNS who contract DT measles NN recover fully . DT risk of complications is higher in DT following groups : Approximately of NNS with measles experience CD or more complications . Measles can lead to life - threatening complications , such as pneumonia and inflammation of DT brain ( encephalitis ) . Other complications associated with measles MD include : • pregnancy complications , such as miscarriage or preterm labor • subacute sclerosing panencephalitis ( SSPE ) , a rare degenerative condition of DT nervous system WDT develops NNS after infection PRP ca n’t VB measles more than once . After PRP ’ve had DT NN , PRP ’re immune for life . However , measles and its potential complications are preventable through NN . NN not only protects PRP and your family , but RB prevents DT measles NN from circulating in your community and affecting those who ca n’t be vaccinated ."

"" DT article is DT latest criticism of a theory WDT has been widely discredited . But if NNS are off DT table , what does cause NN ? While NNS are still investigating DT issue , PRP say DT disorder likely has a number of causes involving both our genes and our environment , or some combination of DT two . For instance , NNS MD have underlying genetic susceptibilities to NN WDT are triggered by something PRP encounter in DT environment . Making things even more complicated is DT fact IN NN , which is characterized by problems interacting and communicating with others , is not a single disorder , but a range of disorders WDT MD have various causes . [ See a timeline of events : NNS and NNP : How DT Truth Unfolded ] "" NNS are VBG to manifest DT disorder in different ways , and DT MD be because EX are different sets of genes , [ or ] different sets of environmental factors , "" WDT contribute to how DT disorder presents itself , VBD Alycia Halladay , director of research for environmental sciences for NNP Speaks , an NN advocacy organization WDT funds NN research . Here are DT latest findings and ideas from NNS about what might really cause this mysterious condition . EX is strong evidence IN changes in our genes contribute to NN . For CD thing , DT disorder is highly heritable . Families WDT have CD child with NN have a 1 in 20 chance of having a second child with NN , according to DT National Institutes of NNP . This is a higher risk than in DT general population . And twin studies have found IN if CD twin has NN , DT other twin as a 90 percent chance of having DT disorder . Research has RB shown IN DT genetic changes WDT contribute to NN do n't have to be inherited — PRP MD RB arise spontaneously . In total , NNS have identified about 20 genes WDT MD be involved in NN spectrum disorder , Halladay VBD . While these genes are located all over DT human genome , PRP share a common theme , she VBD . JJ have a role in brain development , brain growth and DT way brain cells communicate . For example , a recent NN found IN NNS with a genetic mutation on chromosome 17 were 14 times more likely to develop NN than those without DT mutation . Exposure to pesticides has RB been linked to NN . Some studies have found IN pesticides MD interfere with genes involved in DT central nervous system , VBD Dr. Alice Mao , a professor of psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston . NNS VBP IN chemicals in pesticides MD adversely affect those who are genetically predisposed to NN , leading them to develop DT full - blown disorder , Mao VBD . "" Maybe PRP were born with a vulnerability to NN , but then exposure to DT pesticides might have cause DT presentation of NN , "" Mao told MyHealthNewsDaily . Babies WDT have been exposed to certain pharmaceuticals in DT womb , including valproic acid and thalidomide , have been found to have a higher risk of NN . Thalidomide is a drug WDT was first used in DT 1950s to treat morning sickness , anxiety and insomnia . DT drug was withdrawn from DT market after PRP was linked with birth defects , but is currently prescribed for a severe skin disorder and as a treatment for cancer . Valproic acid is a medication prescribed for seizures , mood disorders and bipolar disorder , according to DT NIH . As parents grow older , PRP have a higher risk of having NNS with NN , Halladay VBD . A NN published last February found IN women who are 40 NNS old have a 50 percent greater risk of having a child with NN than women who are between 20 and 29 NNS old . Researchers are n't sure why parental age MD influence NN risk , but PRP might be related to genetic mutations WDT occur in DT sperm or DT egg as parents grow older , Halladay VBD . DT development of DT brain Particular areas of DT brain , including DT cerebral cortex and DT cerebellum , have been implicated in NN , Mao VBD . These brain areas are thought to be responsible for concentration , movement and mood regulation . Irregularities in DT levels of neurotransmitters , such as dopamine and serotonin , have RB been tied to NN , Mao VBD . Problems regulating dopamine can lead to problems with concentration and movement disabilities , while troubles controlling serotonin levels can result in mood problems . While NNS cannot say definitively what causes NN , PRP have come a long way in DT last decade , Halladay VBD . For example , researchers originally thought EX might be just a single gene or a few environmental factors WDT are linked to NN , but now evidence has shown EX are likely to be more . "" I VBP our knowledge has increased , and DT way WDT PRP VBP about looking for potential genes and environmental candidates has improved , "" Halladay VBD . "" PRP 're thinking about a JJ model — PRP 's not just VBG to be just CD gene or CD environmental factor , PRP 's more complex than DT , "" she VBD .

"" What PRP Are n’t Being Told About DT NN PRP Live In How DT “ NN Theory ” Label Was Conceived To Derail DT Truth Movement How Covert American Agents Infiltrate DT Internet to Manipulate , Deceive , and Destroy Reputations Hillary NNP “ Total Terror ” Descends Upon Disabled Mother Who Discovered Her Link To By : Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Western Subscribers A heartbreaking Foreign Intelligence Service ( SVR ) report circulating in DT Kremlin today details DT “ total terror ” Hillary NNP and her Obama regime allies have unleashed upon a disabled American mother of an autistic son who had “ inadvertently / mistakenly ” discovered an “ electronic document ” ( email ? photocopy ? ) written by DT former Secretary of NNP authorizing a massive weapons shipment from , , to Islamic NNP ( ISIS / ISIL / Daesh ) terrorists in . [ Note : Some words and / or phrases appearing in quotes are English language approximations of Russian words / phrases having no exact counterpart . ] According to this report , earlier this spring DT General Directorate of DT General Staff ( GRU ) reported IN PRP obtained a “ treasure trove ” of secret Islamic NN documents from a Syrian village WDT had been retaking by Kurdish forces . Among these documents ( now classified at DT highest security level ) obtained by DT GRU , this report continues , were detailed arrangements between DT Islamic NNP terrorists and DT NNP Department of NNP on DT transferring of weapons and other war materials to Syria from Libya in exchange for payment at DT Turkish - Syrian border of oil stolen from by these terrorists from both Syria and Iraq . Upon DT SVR ’s examination of these Islamic NNP documents , as was requested by DT GRU , this report continues , PRP was discovered IN these terrorists had “ electronically sent ” ( Twitter ) a number of them to their JJ supporters via online social NN as proof IN PRP were being supported by DT NNP NNPS . With Wikileaks having confirmed DT validity of these documents proving Hillary NNP armed these Islamic NNP terrorists , and NNP Senator Rand Paul , likewise , publically stating IN she had shipped weapons to ISIS terror forces in Syria from Benghazi , and then lied about PRP , this report notes , none of America ’s mainstream propaganda press organs have yet to tell DT American NNS of these horrific facts . With DT “ vacuum of truth ” relating to Hillary NNP ’s grave crimes being created by America ’s mainstream press , this report continues , PRP has been left to DT nations independent journalists to keep DT true facts flowing — and whom DT Obama regime , and its propaganda press supporters , now label as “ NN theorists ” . So terrified , in fact , has Hillary NNP and DT Obama regime become of these independent journalists PRP now call “ NN theorists ” , this report documents , top Obama official Cass Sunstein co-authored , in 2008 , a report titled NN Theories : Causes and Cures telling both Obama and Hillary NNP how to move against them — and IN DT secret NNP intelligence documents released by Edward Snowden proved was being implemented by covert American agents who had infiltrated DT internet to manipulate , deceive and destroy DT reputations of all dissidents considered as enemies . To those independent journalists who MD n’t be stopped by having Obama and Hillary NNP destroy their reputations , this report continues , PRP turned to methods of “ total terror ” — such as is currently being used against a disabled 38 - NN - old mother of two named Safya Roe Yassin , CD of whose NNS is autistic . Ms Yassin , this report explains is an American citizen born in DT NNP NNPS , who has never left her country , considers herself as an independent journalist , has never met a Muslim person , but was charged by DT Obama regime with DT grave crime of supporting ISIS — she is n’t accused of plotting a domestic attack or trying to travel overseas to join DT terrorist group . she simply reported DT NN . What made Ms Yassin terrifying to Hillary NNP , however , this report says , was IN she was investigating ISIS and resending to her “ readers / followers ” copies of “ electronic documents ” ( Tweets ) proving NNP ’s NNP NNP Department was funneling weapons to these terrorists from Libya . This report notes IN from NNP NN reports Ms Yassin has been a longtime independent journalist investigator examining various controversial issues such as chemtrials , genetically modified foods , DT dangers of NNS as PRP pertain to NN , and was a frequent reader of longtime “ NN theory ” reporters Alex Jones and David Icke . Living as a shut - in with her father and two NNS in Buffalo , Missouri , this report continues , Ms Yassin rarely left home because she is severely disabled from a spinal injury and depends upon a catheter ( inserted JJ device for releasing urine from DT bladder ) in her daily life — but whom when she began re-Tweeting ISIS documents showing Hillary NNP ’s crimes in arming them , was put under daily surveillance by DT FBI with them charging her , on 11 January , and her trial scheduled to start on CD September . SVR analysts contributing to this report VBP IN Mr Yassin ’s “ motive / reason ” for investigating Hillary NNP ’s links with ISIS related to her Christian belief IN DT “ end times ” might be near — and DT was explained by Audrey Alexander , a researcher at George Washington University ’s Program on Extremism , who noted IN her postings might be confusing to other ISIS supporters due to her originality : “ She is questioning whether ISIL is DT end of times army . DT ’s something WDT a lot of DT community does n’t necessarily latch onto , which is why PRP believe her views are quite well informed . ” Though Ms Yassin ’s aunt , Sandra Mick , told authorities “ DT real story is , she ’s not a terrorist . She retweeted and reposted what other NNS had posted , DT ’s DT story . She ’s never been outside this country . I doubt she ’s even met a real Muslim ” , her cousin , Janice Valenti , asserting IN she is a Christian who teaches her two NNS Bible verses , and DT NNP Federal Judge at her bail hearing stating “ when PRP comes down to PRP , she is a disabled woman who poses no physical threat [ to ] herself and to anyone else ” , this report sadly notes , Obama - NNP forces have been able to keep her jailed and separated from her young NNS , and even worse , have still refused to turn over to her defense attorneys DT evidence PRP claim to have against her . To DT fullest horror , however , of what Hillary NNP has planned for Ms Yassin , this report says , is DT Obama regime planning to silence her under what is called Classified Information Procedures Act ( CIPA ) WDT will deny her DT ability to see any evidence against her , her attorneys not allowed to offer any defense of any kind , and is an exact duplicate of DT Show Trials used to silence dissidents in DT former Soviet Union . Statement of Jeffrey Melhorn about his neighbor Safya Roe Yassin To how DT American NNS themselves are reacting to this disabled young mothers torture by Hillary NNP , this report continues , cannot be known as DT Obama regime supported press still remains silent about this case WDT puts all of these peoples lives in jeopardy — as now any of them who re-Tweets , or in other way , forwards information DT NNP considers subversive can now be jailed for DT rest of their lives . As to what Hillary NNP is most fearful about , this report says , is DT American NNS discovering DT tens - of - millions of dollars she has been given by Saudi Arabia and DT Gulf NNPS , DT over $ 165 billion in arms she gave them too while Secretary of NNP , as DT Wikileaks Cablegate emails prove , and all for DT single purpose of destroying Syria and Iraq in order for these Arab NNS to build natural gas pipelines across in order to achieve DT ultimate goal of destroying both Russia and NNP . To DT only hope Ms Yassin , or for DT matter DT American NNS , has , this report concludes , is Donald NNP — who this past week became DT highest positioned figure in DT NNP to join with DT independent journalists truthfully telling these NNS IN Obama - NNP are , indeed , DT founders of ISIS , and who , RB , by DT most accurate , and honest , accounting made yet of DT upcoming presidential election , is showed to be winning by a landslide .

Read our NN live blog for all DT latest NN and updates However , PRP MD still be two NNS before DT NN is available to use . PRP now needs to be tested in animal experiments before human trials can begin . DT development comes as DT death toll hit 2,247 , and NNS of DT NN reached 76,727 across DT NN . Greffex 's company NN and CEO John Price told DT Houston Business Journal IN PRP did not use a living or killed NN to form DT NN - for safety reasons . DT NN is so poorly understood , has spread so quickly and has killed enough NNS IN NNS at Greffex did not VB to risk exposure WDT MD trigger DT deadly illness known as NNP - CD . Instead , adenovirus - based vector NNS , which are widely employed against various infectious diseases or cancers , were used . Adenoviruses are among DT most common causes of viral respiratory infections , accounting for between two and five per cent of colds . "" DT trick in making a NN is can PRP scale DT NN WDT PRP ’ve made to be able to make a certain number of doses , can PRP test DT NN quickly and efficiently and then can PRP VB PRP into patients , "" Price told local outlet KHOU 11 . "" And DT ’s where PRP have an edge as well on DT other companies WDT are out RB . ” DT NN is DT product of an $ 18.9 million ( £ 14.64 million ) contract Greffex received in September 2019 from DT National Institute of NNP ’s National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases , aimed at fighting infectious threats , DT Business Journal reported . NN is an airborne NN , spread in a similar way to colds and DT NN . Symptoms include a runny nose , headache , cough and fever , shortness of breath , chills and body aches . PRP is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything DT NN is on as well as infected breath , coughs or sneezes . In most NNS , PRP wo n't VB whether PRP have a NN or a different cold - causing NN , such as rhinovirus . But if a NN infection spreads to DT lower respiratory tract ( your windpipe and your lungs ) , PRP can cause pneumonia , especially in older NNS , NNS with heart NN or NNS with weakened immune systems . EX is no NN currently available for NN . In 2003 an outbreak of a similar NN , SARS , infected more than 8,000 NNS in 37 NNS before PRP was brought under control , killing 800 of those worldwide . If DT NN wins NN approval in DT NNP , Greffex will give PRP away for free to DT hardest - hit NNS , Price VBD . More than 2,100 NNS have died as a result of DT NN - CD outbreak , with all but 11 of those deaths in mainland NNP . Worldwide , more than 75,700 NNS have been infected .

Yesterday , PRP was revealed IN DT UK high street MD be hit with shortages of stock due to DT deadly NN .

DT NN and stories WDT matter , delivered weekday mornings . PRP ’s getting ugly out RB on social NN . Anti-vaccine activists are attacking pediatricians head to head on Twitter , Facebook and other social NN platforms , and PRP ’re not hesitating to make their attacks personal . A few fed - up doctors are fighting back , both online and , more recently , in DT courts . CD pediatrician , Dr. Eve Switzer of Enid , Oklahoma , filed a defamation suit last NN against former Oklahoma ophthalmologist Jim Meehan and Oklahomans for NNP and NNP Choice , saying PRP publicly and falsely accused her of failing to provide informed consent to parents about vaccinations . “ Anti-vaxxers have gotten out of control , ” Switzer told NBC NNP . “ As a pediatrician , DT way IN PRP has affected me personally , my practice and my staff , even , I really felt IN I needed to have some sort of remedy and my only remedy was a legal remedy . ” PRP 's difficult enough to counter DT continual questions raised by NN skeptics and activists who , increasingly , say all NNS are unsafe for all NNS . Worries about NN , a preservative called thimerosal , DT spacing of NNS , NN ingredients and whether kids VBP too JJ NNS have all been repeatedly and thoroughly addressed , but DT does n’t stop users of social NN from bringing them up again and again . “ VBG up against DT anti-vaccine movement is a thankless task for a number of reasons . For CD , DT goalpost is moving , ” VBD Dr. Peter Hotez , director of DT Texas NNP 's Hospital Center for NNP Development and dean of DT school of tropical medicine at Baylor College of Medicine . “ So if PRP can explain why MMR ( measles , mumps and rubella ) NN does n’t cause NN , PRP ’ll turn around and say well PRP must be thimerosal in NNS . If PRP debunk this , then PRP ’ll say ‘ well PRP are spacing NNS too close together ’ and if PRP debunk DT and then PRP ’s aluminum in NNS , ” he added . Using social NN takes PRP to a JJ level . Just as online NNS allow NNS to stay in their own political echo chambers , viewing and sharing only their own beliefs , use of social NN is allowing NN skeptics to harden their messages . Facebook feeds offer continual validation with video after video of parents who say PRP believe NNS gave their NNS eczema or asthma or even killed their babies — claims made with no JJ backing . And on Twitter , any post about DT benefits of NNS — all supported by decades of NN — is often immediately attacked . Most recently , a Detroit - area mother jailed for a week for refusing to follow a court order WDT involved vaccinating her kids got an instant support group . Although DT judge in DT case , Circuit Court Judge Karen McDonald , made PRP clear DT sentence was about disregarding a court order WDT Bredow had initially agreed to , Bredow herself and anti-vaccine groups framed PRP as having taken a stand for her beliefs . In reality , EX is no legitimate debate about DT safety or benefits of NNS . While no JJ group claims NNS are 100 percent safe , DT Centers for NNP Control and Prevention , National Institutes of NNP , and dozens of academic researchers independent of DT federal NN have shown DT benefits of NNS both to individual NNS and adults and to DT population at large . “ Childhood NN saves up to 3 million lives every NN , but 1.5 million NNS still die each NN from diseases WDT MD have been prevented by NNS , ” DT nonprofit Sabin NNP Institute says . But PRP might not VB IN if PRP take a look at social NN . “ PRP ’s more systematic and more aggressive and more effective , ” VBD Hotez , who is RB a pediatrician , DT parent of a young woman with NN , and a vocal advocate for NN . “ EX ’s a JJ element to DT anti-vaccine group WDT has sort of an alt - right flavor to PRP . ” Theodore Tomeny of DT psychology department of DT University of Alabama and colleagues tracked Twitter activity and found more than 270,000 tweets containing anti-vaccine statements between 2009 and 2015 — half of all DT tweets PRP found about NNS in general . California , Connecticut , Massachusetts , NNP York and Pennsylvania were particularly rich in anti-vaccine Twitter users . “ PRP found IN anti-vaccine sentiment seems to be prevalent on Twitter , ” Tomeny VBD . “ PRP RB seems to cluster geographically . PRP observed spikes over NN WDT seemed to be associated with current events IN CD of DT recent measles outbreaks in California . ” PRP not only repeat untrue rumors about NNS , but accuse NN and academic doctors of colluding with pharmaceutical companies to cover up DT dangers of NNS , without real evidence to back up these accusations . Pediatricians , JJ NN experts and others MD do well to monitor this type of social NN use and counter its influence , Tomeny and colleagues wrote in DT October issue of DT journal Social NNP & Medicine . DT instinct for some MD be to just turn them off . “ Thank god for DT mute and block function , ” Hotez VBD . But Hotez says PRP ’s RB important to counter some of DT more viral wrong stuff . Related : Detroit Mom Jailed , But Was PRP Really About NNS ? “ I VBP PRP ’s very important to VB DT facts out RB . So I have put a lot of effort into explaining why NNS do n’t cause NN , ” he VBD . “ DT argument IN measles is not dangerous — I VBP DT is important to refute . DT allegation IN I am making millions of dollars off my NN — I VBP PRP ’s important to refute DT . ” Texas NNP 's took over work from DT Sabin NNP Institute to develop NNS to prevent parasitic diseases such as hookworm and schistosomiasis . “ PRP do n’t seem to understand IN these are NNS for DT NN ’s poorest NNS WDT will never make any money , ” Hotez VBD . PRP ’s not difficult to find personal attacks against Hotez on DT internet , including blogs WDT outright call him a liar . Dr. Paul Offit of NNP ’s Hospital of Philadelphia is a veteran of such personal attacks WDT even extended to threats against his kids . But with universal access to social NN giving a platform to anyone with a smartphone , any pediatrician who is vocal about DT anti-vaccine movement , or who even posts something JJ about DT benefits of NNS , can be targeted . Tomeny VBD PRP MD be DT impersonal aspect of social NN . “ Perhaps PRP ’s DT fact IN PRP is not face - to - face communication , ” he VBD . “ PRP are not having to view DT other person ’s reactions and temper your statements based on PRP . ” Switzer has found IN to be DT case . While she finds PRP easy to answer polite questions from parents in her office , she ’s had a different experience online . “ Most of what I VBP WDT ’s confrontational is on social NN , ” she VBD . “ This is a group of NNS who when I say anti-vaxxers , these are DT NNS I am talking about — DT NNS who are confrontational . PRP adamantly believe IN NNS are n’t safe or effective .

"" DT practice is called a human - challenge NN -- or controlled human infection NN -- and PRP can truncate a conventional NN NN by several months . DT reason : Rather than waiting for months to assess what percentage thousands of NN - trial volunteers VBP infected with DT NN in question while leading their day - to - day lives , a challenge trial is much simpler , in IN PRP exposes about 100 volunteers directly to DT pathogen -- via syringe , cocktail , mosquito bite or nasal spray after an experimental NN or placebo is administered . ( If DT NNP - CD NN comes to fruition , experts say PRP MD likely be administered by nose drop . ) But if PRP 's high reward , PRP 's RB high risk : Although NNP - CD is a much more deadly NN for DT elderly and DT compromised than healthy young adults , PRP is an unpredictable pathogen WDT has put star athletes in DT hospital . What 's more , should something VB wrong , treatment options are limited . However , with DT NN still raging after having killed more than 82,000 Americans and 291,000 NNS worldwide since PRP first appeared in NNP late last NN , some say a riskier - than - normal NN is justified . Co-authored by Nir Eyal of Rutgers , Marc Lipsitch of Harvard , and Peter Smith of DT London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine , DT piece concluded IN while a human challenge NN MD not be without risks , "" every week IN NN rollout is delayed will be accompanied by JJ thousands of deaths globally . "" "" PRP 's an idea WDT is controversial when NNS hear about PRP for DT first NN , "" Eyal , a bioethicist , told CNN . "" However , PRP show IN if PRP select NNS in DT right way and conduct DT trial in DT right way , PRP 's surprisingly low risk and certainly within DT bounds of what PRP already approve . "" Such a NN MD ultimately need DT blessing of DT NNP Food and Drug Administration . But DT researchers ' call for a challenge NN has since been propelled by DT popular support of those who have indicated on 1 Day Sooner -- which is incorporating as a nonprofit organization -- WDT they'd be willing guinea pigs . ( This is just an informal expression of interest , not a binding contract . ) DT site , which was inspired by DT scholarly article , launched in mid-April and is premised on DT claim IN shaving even CD day from DT long - distance race for a NNP - CD NN MD save up to 7,120 lives . What a human challenge NN for NN MD look IN At some point , should a group of researchers decide to seriously explore DT matter , DT site MD ask prospective volunteers to fill out pre-qualification questionnaires WDT MD divulge more of their JJ history , region of residence and other information WDT MD help determine eligibility , VBD 1 Day Sooner 's co-founder Josh Morrison . DT researchers MD then screen those forms for DT most eligible applicants and MD eventually seek approval from a research or JJ center to host DT NN , he VBD . Morrison is a former corporate lawyer who gave up life in DT fast lane to start a nonprofit organization called Waitlist Zero , which matches prospective kidney donors with recipients . Because business is at a near - standstill in DT kidney - transplant NN , Morrison found himself with a lot of spare NN . "" I was IN sitting at home in my apartment in NNP York City , just kind of depressed , "" he VBD . Morrison came across DT Journal article while noodling around on DT internet . "" And I thought , ' Well , MD I VB to do this ? ' "" he VBD . "" I 'm pretty young , 34 , and in good NN . And so I thought , ' Yeah , I VBP I MD . ' "" An FDA spokesperson told CNN IN DT agency MD work with those who are interested in conducting human challenge trials to help them evaluate ethical and other issues . "" A formal determination about any specific human challenge trial proposal MD be made by DT FDA in DT context of all DT information WDT is available at DT NN , "" Michael Felberbaum wrote in an email . Conventional NN trials typically consist of three phases -- DT first , in which fewer than 100 participants are dosed to determine DT safety ; DT second , in which DT number of participants ramps up into DT hundreds ; and DT third , in which DT NN is broadened to include thousands of NNS . Typically , in DT third phase , DT participants return to their daily lives , and researchers -- over a period of months -- compare rates of infection between DT placebo and test groups . A human - challenge trial can replace a third phase , DT Journal article says , short - circuiting DT timeline by several months because researchers do n't have to wait for participants to VB infected DT organic way -- by interacting with NNS at work , at school , in houses of worship or in homes . Instead , PRP expose DT volunteers to DT pathogen right then and RB , in DT lab . A challenge trial can RB serve as a bridge to a Phase 3 NN , helping researchers determine which NN candidates are most promising ; or PRP can pave DT way for provisional licensure in emergency situations . For a NNP - CD trial of DT sort WDT 1 Day Sooner is advocating , DT setup MD likely entail first injecting an experimental NN into DT arms of about 50 volunteers and a placebo into 50 others , challenge - trial experts told CNN . Two to four weeks later , all 100 MD be exposed to DT NN -- perhaps via nose - drop . Human - challenge studies are n't JJ . PRP have played a key role in DT development of several NNS , including ones for malaria , NN and dengue . Without human - challenge studies , a JJ NN for typhoid MD n't have been brought to Zimbabwe on a provisional basis last NN , human - challenge experts told CNN . DT "" FDA approved a cholera NN simply on DT basis of a human challenge , "" VBD Dr. Robert Read , an infectious - NN expert in DT UK . DT difference is IN those diseases came with fewer unknowns than NNP - CD , and clinicians running DT trials were able to offer JJ treatments -- such as antibiotics or antivirals -- to infected patients exhibiting symptoms . And although DT idea of conducting a human - challenge trial for NNP - CD is catching on in DT NN community , some experts have raised serious concerns about safety . Read , head of clinical and experimental sciences at University of Southampton , points out IN NNP - CD remains a mysterious pathogen , and researchers can't give volunteers an accurate sense of DT risk associated with getting intentionally infected . "" PRP do have to be able to describe what PRP VBP of what MD happen to them if PRP undertake a controlled infection , with complete clarity and honesty , "" VBD Read , who has himself conducted challenge trials -- he recently infected dozens of volunteers with whooping cough in search of a more effective NN . "" And I VBP lots of volunteers , when faced with DT information , MD probably not consent to PRP . "" Dr. Anna Durbin , a professor of international NN at DT Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of NNP NNP -- who has led a human - challenge trial for dengue and worked on another for malaria -- VBD she MD be interested to hear how some prospective volunteers MD respond to these reports of "" cerebral vascular accidents . "" "" Millennials do n't VB PRP are VBG to VB sick from this , "" VBD Durbin , who , IN Read , is open to DT idea of human challenge trials for NNP - CD , but stresses IN PRP is incumbent upon researchers to fully evaluate DT risks of such a model and to share them to DT fullest extent possible with prospective participants . "" PRP see lots of young NNS in DT hospital on ventilators . "" Volunteers have different reasons for signing up -- some altruistic , some pragmatic Rohrig VBD DT frightening spate of young NNP - CD patients having strokes was NN to him . "" DT 's jarring , "" he VBD . "" I VBP EX is a non-trivial risk . "" And yet , Rohrig VBD he 's almost certainly up for PRP . "" I VBP IN EX are risks , and if I were to do this , and PRP were to VB poorly , then DT MD be terrible , my family MD be really sad , "" Rohrig VBD . But "" someone has to step up . PRP seems IN this just needs to happen . "" Not all of DT prospective volunteers are in their 20s . John Gentle , an entrepreneur in Alabama , turns 41 on Thursday . He has a wife and four kids . IN Rohrig , Gentle believes a challenge NN MD afford him a chance to make a societal contribution to DT NN effort . But as DT owner of a business WDT has him visiting warehouses and flying regularly , he figures he 'll inevitably VB infected -- so he might as well VB PRP over with . "" I feel if I did PRP under a controlled environment , and I had an adverse reaction , my chances are much better in a controlled environment than I did n't VB I had PRP for a week until something had deteriorated to DT point I realized , "" Gentle VBD . Indeed , human challenge studies occur in tightly controlled settings . DT report in DT Journal of Infectious Diseases advises keeping DT subjects in isolation for several weeks and guaranteeing them access to DT NN - of - DT - art facilities of DT NN system , should DT need arise . "" As a part of being in DT trial PRP MD be guaranteed excellent care if PRP needed PRP , "" Lipsitch , a Harvard epidemiologist , told CNN . "" Of course , PRP MD expect nobody in DT trial on average MD need PRP , but averages do n't always play out . "" Over DT NNS , he VBD , he has infected some 600 students with DT NN . PRP typically ingest DT NN via a sodium - bicarbonate drink resembling Alka - Seltzer and VBP home . RB , PRP await DT symptoms of typhoid -- for DT NN participants PRP include headache , fever and constipation -- which generally kick in within four or five days . At this point , he VBD , DT volunteers with symptoms are given a regimen of antibiotics , which clear up DT symptoms in a couple of days . "" PRP have extensive follow - up data and have not had any long - term problems identified , "" Darton VBD in an email . "" DT model is safe and reproducible and is a model of mild symptomatic illness only . "" Today 's standards for human - challenge trials are rigorous . Durbin of Johns Hopkins points out IN PRP takes a minimum of six months of prep work to responsibly carry out a human - challenge trial . This is in part because a suitable strain of DT NN -- and DT proper dosage -- must be developed in a lab outfitted with high biosafety standards . RB , researchers must find JJ centers WDT are willing to house DT participants in isolation for DT duration of DT NN and provide first - rate care to anyone who falls seriously ill . "" I VBP PRP 's very important IN PRP plan for these studies now ... and PRP VBP PRP right , "" Durbin VBD . "" Yes , PRP MD take NN for a good human challenge model to be developed , but if PRP wait too long to develop PRP , then I VBP DT moment has passed . "" Caring for volunteers can VB tricky CD of DT trickier aspects of a challenge NN is compensation . Pay too little , and DT NN MD fail to attract candidates ; pay too much , and NNS MD be enticed by DT money without thinking of their safety . DT latter scenario played out with DT yellow - fever trials , in which a participant who was hoping to start a farm in Cuba VBD PRP was a "" cold - blooded business decision . "" DT NNP 7 article in NNP -- which concludes IN DT extraordinary nature of DT NNP - CD pandemic warrants laying DT groundwork for controlled human - infection trials -- recommends "" several thousand dollars . "" Seema Shah , a bioethicist and associate professor at Northwestern University 's Feinberg School of Medicine -- and an author of DT NNP article -- VBD participants of a recent 40 - day human - challenge NN for malaria were paid about $ 2,300 . "" Some were very motivated by DT money , but others were RB interested in DT experience , and still others have strong motivations to help others , "" she VBD , adding IN some participants personally knew sufferers of malaria and some even donated some of their earnings to charities . DT article in DT Journal of Infectious Diseases likens DT act of volunteering for a human - challenge trial to other JJ - service endeavors -- such as volunteer firefighting or organ donation . "" NNS are willing to take on life - threatening risk for other NNS 's benefit and often not just as a job but as a form of altruistic behavior , "" Lipsitch VBD . "" PRP not only encourage DT , but PRP completely depend on DT in JJ sectors of our lives . "" Still , DT onus is on DT researchers to ensure IN DT participants stay safe . "" What keeps me up at night , "" VBD Durbin , "" is if I administer a challenge agent to somebody , and DT person gets seriously ill or dies -- DT 's on me . """

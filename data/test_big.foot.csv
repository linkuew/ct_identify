897,"My encounter with the zealotry of campus thought police caused me to widen my research interests in order to better understand the intensifying muscularity of Zionist interventions in university governance.

The content of this essay reflects my widened research interests since 2016 when I was confronted with a politically-driven assault explicitly targeting my academic work. This essay emerges from my study of the role of the Israel Lobby in its efforts to constrain the latitude of academic freedom when it comes to virtually all facets of university study concerning Israel-Palestinian relations. This Zionist attack extends to efforts to delegitimize my academic work connecting the 9/11 debacle to the promotion of public attitudes that embrace Palestinianophobia, Arabophobia, Islamophobia, and Iranophobia.

The imperial march of the Zio-American empire in the Middle East and Eurasia has been well served by the academic failure to decisively explain the role of Western security agencies in the genesis of al-Qaeda and its more recent incarnation, ISIL/Daesh. The imperial strategy presently being perpetrated emerges from years of propaganda reports presenting the lie that the West is faced with a concerted and global onslaught of Islamic terrorists acting independently with the primary purpose of defeating “the West” and creating a global caliphate.

Generally speaking the dissemination as fact of a specious interpretation of 9/11 and other instances of false flag terrorism has promoted the dissemination of popular perceptions that have replaced the conceptual construction of the now-defunct Cold War. One of the dominant geopolitical paradigms governing the conduct of Western power on and after 9/11 is that of the Global War on Terror. This GWOT was made to emerge from the faulty foundations underlying Bernard Lewis’ problematic articulation of the clash-of-civilizations thesis.

The legacy of almost a whole generation of this kind of delusionary reporting, much of it derived from Prof. Bernard Lewis’ prolific Orientalism, has served to bring public opinion generally in line with the perpetration of many war crimes by Western powers. These international crimes include genocide in Palestine, illegal invasions of several Muslim majority countries, illegal torture, and the surveillance state’s mass transformation of citizens into suspects.

In my research into attacks by the Israel Lobby on protections for academic freedom, I considered an effort by Zionist organizations to stop a major academic conference from taking place at York University in Toronto in 2009. The inspiration for that conference began with the proposal to look at a one-state rather than a two-state approach to bringing a level of a peaceful resolution to Israeli-Palestinian animosity.

B’nai Brith Canada was one of the most aggressive of the Zionist organizations involved in the effort to silence academic voices by shutting down the York University conference. Along with the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, the CIJA, B’nai Brith Canada worked closely with the Board of Governors of the University of Lethbridge with the objective of turning me from my academic position.

My survey of the history of B’nai Brith attacks on free speech and open discourse in Canada extended to my study of Palestinian Canadian, Nadia Shoufani. In 2016 B’nai Brith attempted to have Ms. Shoufani stripped of her teaching job in a Roman Catholic school in Mississauga Ontario because of the content of a lively and informative speech she delivered on Quds Day.

B’nai Brith Canada also attacked a Canadian parliamentarian seeking the leadership of Canada’s left-leaning New Democratic Party. Niki Ashton’s alleged crime was to have proposed bringing to Canada’s Parliament a more attentive focus on the human rights of Palestinian people. Given her role as the NDP MP for a large electoral riding with an Aboriginal majority in northern Manitoba, Ms. Ashton is probably more sensitive than many of her colleagues when it comes to the grievances and assertions of indigenous Palestinians in the Middle East.

I have also looked to the United States to identify examples of the kind of academic attacks I have faced in the Canadian province of Alberta. I found much to consider in the reflections of William I. Robinson, a senior tenured professor of Sociology at the University of California in Santa Barbara. My attention was caught by his experiences dealing with partnerships of Zionist operatives that coordinated their defamatory activities inside and outside the University of California. Prof. Robinson’s experience reminded me of patterns of attack that I also faced in the University of Lethbridge case

Prof. Robinson, who is Jewish, brought on the ire of the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith in 2009 for his critical focus on Israeli treatment of Palestinians in his research, publication and teaching. For expressing freely the outcome of his own independent scholarship, Prof. Robinson was made to face severe recriminations from Zionist thought police. Prof. Robinson has described his ordeal in an article entitled, “As Repression Escalates on Campuses, An Account of My Ordeal with the Israel Lobby and UC.” As Prof. Robinson explains,

Prof. Robinson persevered with the help of many conscientious colleagues who joined the dissident academic in fending off the professional assault on our senior colleague’s academic freedom. In the process Prof. Robinson became a leading voice of a national movement to illuminate the nature of the threat to the academic integrity of institutions of higher learning.

In their introduction to a volume published in 2017, We Will Not Be Silenced: The Academic Repression of Israel’s Critics, Prof. Robinson joined with Maryam S. Griffin to report,

In his Truthdig essay Prof. Robinson points to the experiences of hundreds of professors and student groups “who have been harassed and prosecuted for speaking out against Israeli occupation and apartheid and in support of the Palestinian struggle.” Some of the cases are “high profile in the media and others have gone relatively unknown.” Two of the more high profile cases are those of Palestinian professors, Hatem Bazian at Zaytuna College at the University of California in Berkeley and Rabab Adulhadi at San Francisco State University.

The Case of Dr. Steven Salaita at the University of Illinois

My own history of academic employment in the field of Native American Studies at the University of Lethbridge naturally drew me to look especially carefully at the case of Dr. Steven Salaita. A high order of academic controversy was generated with the withdrawal of Dr. Salaita’s appointment in 2014 just as he was about to begin holding forth on the pedagogical stage at the University of Illinois. The ensuing discussions, debates, negotiations and acrimonies gave rise to one of the most important showdowns in the history of North American universities. The showdown gave rise to a classic test of influence weighing the imperatives of academic freedom against the clout of concentrated wealth and political power.

Dr. Salaita is an American of Christian Palestinian background who earned his Ph.D. in Native American Studies at the University of Oklahoma in 2003. After several years of teaching English literature at Virginia Tech University, Dr. Salaita accepted the offer of a tenured position at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. Just as the new term was about to begin, the University of Illinois administration essentially fired its new faculty member before he had a chance to deliver his first lecture.

The university trustees and chancellor pointed to some negative responses to Dr. Salaita’s tweets as its rationale for overruling the decision of the relevant hiring committee. These tweets were made during a particularly lethal phase in one of the Israeli government’s periodic episodes of “mowing the grass” in the Gaza open-air prison. The Israeli government keeps about 1,500,000 Palestinian refugees tightly confined within the Gaza enclave. “Mowing the grass” is a telling Israeli euphemism for attacking Palestinians with military force.

The IDF invasion of Gaza in 2014 was described as Operation Protective Edge. It included airborne attacks, some of them targeting UN installations including a school. Over 2,000 Palestinians were killed in these attacks including the deaths of over 500 children. Dr. Salaita highlighted in his criticisms of the Israeli actions the IDF’s murder of Palestinian youth, a perspective later emphasized in a report entitled, Operation Protective Edge: A War Waged on Gaza’s Children.

There are far-ranging and still-unresolved implications in the decision to hire and then fire Dr. Salaita as a tenured Associate Professor of American Indian Studies. By 2014 Dr. Salaita’s record of research and publication had put into bold relief some of the main continuities and discontinuities in the colonization of Indigenous peoples in both the Middle East and the Americas.

The decision to hire Dr. Salaita came as a result of a decade-long evolution that had taken place within the field of Native American Studies (NAS). NAS initially caught hold in many North American universities during 1970s and 1980s. Gradually some in this academic field, myself included, recognized the value of expanding the scope of our academic project.

Increasingly “Indigenous Studies” on a worldwide scale was added into the original paradigm of the Native American Studies. This shift in orientation was made easier because of the integral role of the United States, but especially the US Armed Forces, in the process of imperial globalization.

One of the venues hosting this process of academic transnationalization was the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association founded in 2007. A leading light in the establishment and growth of this academic venture was Dr. Robert Warrior, chair of the University of Illinois department that hired Dr. Salaita in 2014. Drs. Warrior and Salaita developed some of their collaborative interactions within the framework of the American Studies Association, an especially important focus of BDS activism highlighting the injustices suffered by Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. To the dismay of some critics, Native American and Indigenous Studies Association extended the BDS movement by joining the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel.

Quite likely there was more to the decision to pre-empt Dr. Salaita’s academic appointment than a flurry of negative responses to his social media tweets during the height of the particularly violent phase of the Israeli invasion of Gaza in 2014. There is significant evidence of powerful interests starting to converge in the months prior to the withdrawal of Dr. Salaita’s appointment.

This withdrawal occurred just as Dr. Salaita was poised to become the primary point person in an important academic departure in the study of indigeneity. If the usual rules of academic conduct had been allowed to prevail, such a model might have inspired similar innovations in the comparative analysis of colonialism as well as in the literature produced by those on both the delivering and receiving end of colonialism

American Indian Studies Department Chair, Prof. Robert Warrior, was one of the main driving forces in the process of extending the frontiers of Native American Studies. One site where traction was gained in this educational process was in the work of the committee whose members approved the granting to Steven Salaita of a Ph.D. at the University of Oklahoma in 2003. Prof. Warrior was a member of the Ph.D. committee overseeing and evaluating the academic work of Steven Salaita.

Anxieties were aroused in high places by the integration of a strong Palestinian perspective into the academic initiative that began with the establishment of Native American Studies and Native Studies departments throughout North America. For some of the PR luminaries pushing the agenda of the Israel Lobby in North America, the integration of Palestinian history into the broader patterns of Aboriginal history raised many red flags. The popular embrace of the developing intellectual synergy in Native American-Palestinian interactions signaled to attentive Israel First partisans the need for quick intervention in academic governance to snip the unwanted intellectual growth in the bud.

The intensity of the zeal to repress the subject of parallels in the ongoing colonial repression of Palestinians and Native Americans can be seen as proof of this topic’s perceived potential to alter understandings and attitudes both inside and outside the academy. The stakes are thus high when it comes to determining what narratives will prevail informal descriptions of the connections linking the rise of the US superpower with the history of Zionism and the emergence of the Jewish state.

The relationships of power embedded in these connections have created many overlaps and parallels that have profoundly affected the lives and the deaths of Indigenous peoples on the frontiers of settler expansionism in both North America and the region in the Middle East encompassing the ongoing and future expansion of Eretz Israel, Greater Israel.

Dr. Warrior is a registered member of the Osage nation and one of the most well-published practitioners of his interdisciplinary field of Native American Studies. As Dr. Warrior tells it, his aroused interests in relations between the Palestinian people and the Israeli state go back to his time in the 1980s as a volunteer archaeologist for the Israel government’s Department of Antiquities and Museums. In his post-graduate education the emerging scholar became a student at Columbia University of Prof. Edward Said. Dr. Warrior thoughtfully describes the late Prof. Said as “a Palestinian American scholar and one of the most influential thinkers of the past half-century.”

A telling prelude to the controversy generated by Dr. Salaita’s appointment in the American Indian Studies Department at the University of Illinois was generated in January of 2014. The basic configurations of agreement and attack began to take shape in response to the content of an academic conference hosted by the Center for American Studies and Research at the American University in Beirut Lebanon. The general theme of the conference was “Transnational American Studies.” Together with several other Native American, Palestinian and indigenous Hawaiian colleagues, Drs. Warrior and Salaita were prominent among the conference’s organizers and presenters.

One of the highlighted subjects was so-called “Redwashing.” One facet of Redwashing involves dramatizing the idea that Jews, not Palestinians, are the indigenous people of the Holy Land where Europe, Asia and Africa converge at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea. Dr. Salaita’s contribution to the discussion in Beirut delved into the symbolic importance of how the Jewish state deals with Native Americans. His presentation was entitled, “Multiculturalism as Colonization: Why Israel So Eagerly Courts Indians.”

A Metis man from Alberta responded to the account of the Beirut conference that appeared in the now-defunct newspaper, Indian Country Today.

Two years later the same Metis man would be hired by B’nai Brith Canada to help put across the Facebook Deception, in other words the fraud introducing the smear campaign designed to uproot me from my professional post in the academy.

Ryan Bellerose aligned himself with the Redwashing agenda of the Israel Lobby by condemning the part of the Beirut conference devoted to finding common cause among Palestinian, Native Americans and indigenous Hawaiian academics. Shortly following his intervention Bellerose was rewarded for the positions he articulated. He was sponsored to visit Israel as a guest of StandWithUs, one of a large array of agencies devoted to countering the educational narrative advanced by the BDS movement.

Bellerose argued mistakenly in his op-ed in Indian Country Today that the sessions in Beirut pertaining to Aboriginal rights didn’t include “actual Indians” but only non-Indian “bigots” who “hide their bigotry underneath our [Aboriginal] banner.” The Metis pundit accused the supposed non-Indians of his imagination of “presuming to lie to us and perpetuate false narratives.” His presentation affirmed that Jews are the Indigenous peoples of the Israel area whereas Palestinians Arabs wandered outside their Aboriginal lands in “Arabia.”

Dr. Warrior responded to Ryan Bellerose in the same newspaper in mid-January of 2014. In his response, Dr. Warrior detailed the backgrounds of some conference presenters all involved in the BDS campaign. He describes these individuals as competent academics and “incredibly fine people” who all deserved better and more fair-minded representation in a venue like Indian Country Today.

Dr. Warrior referred by name and reputation to several Native American scholars beside himself who had made contributions to the “Transnational” event in Beirut. He also described some of the academic work of two Palestinians academics plus that of an indigenous Hawaiian professor who, like Bellerose himself, is of mixed ancestry.

Dr. Warrior wrote that it would be “easy to dismiss” Bellerose’s essay as “laughable.” “It is heavy on bluster and light on accuracy,” the Native American professor wrote. This characterization of Bellerose as being “heavy on bluster and light on accuracy” well describes the man I would later see in action when he was employed by B’nai Brith Canada. One of his main assignment in this hasbara job was to smear me in the media by publicizing the horrific content of the Facebook Deception, a digital post from the notorious Joshua Goldberg that was deceptively and dishonestly attributed to me.

When was Ryan Bellerose first put on the payroll of the Israel Lobby in North America? Who hired him? Dr. Warrior continued, explaining accurately I believe that Bellerose’s attack employed “ugly characterizations and simplistic historical analysis in discussing deadly important and serious issues regarding American Indians, Israel and Palestine.”

Of course, Ryan Bellerose is entitled, as is any layman, to his opinions about what members of the academy say, do, write, teach or think. Ryan Bellerose, however, is not entitled to present himself as if he is an academic peer of genuine scholars who have paid their professional dues---- scholars who maybe Native American, Palestinian, indigenous Hawaiian or members of any other national, religious, racial, religious, ideological or sexual-orientation group. And yet that is precisely what the Metis man did when Ryan Bellerose responded to the positions advanced by Drs. Warrior and Salaita as well as their colleagues by writing of himself as a “Native American scholar.”

Bellerose’s overinflated sense of himself as being qualified to pass professional judgment on the performance of accredited faculty members shows up in his claim of possessing “credibility for which we have fought hard.” Bellerose does not clarify whom he has in mind in invoking the term, “we.” So far I have not been able to find anything on Ryan Bellerose’s educational background other than a mention that he has been a semi-professional football player and an oil-rig worker

Ryan Bellerose was scheduled to speak to members of the Jewish student group, Hillel, in Montreal in March of 2015. The invitation came as a result of the ruckus he raised by highlighting his own Aboriginal identity in his sharp expressions of hostility towards the plight of the dispossessed and uprooted Palestinian people. Several hours before the event, his talk was canceled when some Hillel members complained of the lack of civility in some of Bellerose’s tweets. Two days after the cancellation, the Canadian Institute for Jewish Research (CIJR) provided Bellerose with a kind of consolation platform on which to speak.

At that event, the Metis man from Paddle Prairie Alberta recounted some elements of his interactions with Drs. Warrior and Salaita. These exchanges included an account of Bellerose’s attendance at Dr. Salaita’s talk in Edmonton Alberta during the persecuted academic’s post-firing tour. Bellerose’s CIJR talk put in the forefront his propensity to be, in the words of Dr. Warrior, “Heavy on bluster and short on accuracy.”

Hillel’s sensible intervention notwithstanding, the propensity of the members of the Israel Lobby in North America to highlight Ryan Bellerose’s often crude and ill-informed vituperations speaks of their fear of compelling analysis linking the plight of Palestinians and Native Americans. It speaks of their willingness to put at the forefront any Native voice no matter how crude and unschooled that might have the effect of at least slowing down the progress of a potentially transformative academic discourse.

This discourse has been marshaled most expertly so far by Steven Salaita with the knowledgeable backing and encouragement of Robert Warrior. They are continuing the intellectual work initiated by Edward Said who famously identified the importance of the social sciences in the Orientalist colonization of the Arab and predominantly Islamic peoples in the Near and Middle East. Prof. Said died before he was able to look deeply into the ironies of his own Palestinian American identity that combines contrapuntally the roles of colonizers and of the colonized spanning both the Middle East and the Western Hemisphere.

This extension of Prof. Said’s discourse was pioneered at the American University in early 2014 in Beirut where a significant intellectual opening was created for transnational decolonization. This opening helped create analytical space for the alignment of Native North American political struggles with those of other Indigenous peoples globally, but especially those of the brain trust guiding the Palestinian freedom struggle.

The qualitative distance between the academic discourse of Ryan Bellerose and Steven Salaita is striking.

In the video of his talk to the CJIR, Bellerose referred to Dr. Salaita as a “fucking idiot,” as being “full of crap.” He described the Palestinian-American scholar as being “a terrible speaker” whose writing is “of a third-grade level.” Bellerose indicated that the “worst hour and a half I ever spent was reading his [Dr. Salaita’s] book.” Bellerose added, “It was a total waste. I might as well as have spent the time in the bathroom.” Bellerose declares in an accusatory fashion that Dr. Salaita was unqualified to teach in American Indian Studies because he has a “degree in English.”

As already noted, Dr. Salaita’s Ph.D. is in Native American Studies at the University of Oklahoma. His emphasis was on Native American, Palestinian and Arab literature. In 2015-16 Dr. Salaita was installed into the Edward W. Said Chair of American Studies at the American University of Beirut. Prof. Said did much to open the way for the work of Dr. Salaita, Prof. Warrior and many other scholarly disciples during his four decades as Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University.

In his lecture Ryan Bellerose had much to say about the supposed lack of qualifications of those he targeted for attack. These attacks were, by and large, spurious and conspicuously ill-informed. Bellerose’s attempted condemnation of Dr. Warrior’s academic credentials was especially telling. Dr. Warrior earned his Ph.D. at the Union Theological Seminary, an old and celebrated institution of higher learning affiliated with Columbia University in New York City. Prof. Warrior did his M.A. at Yale University and did his B.A. summa cum laude in Speech Communications at Pepperdine University. In his reference to Dr. Warrior, Ryan Bellerose indicates “he has a degree is something called consciousness studies. What the hell is consciousness studies?”

Bellerose highlighted one of Steven Salaita’s books entitled Israel’s Dead Soul. Dr. Salaita’s publication includes critiques of liberal multiculturalism whose proponents, he alledges, consistently fail to condemn forthrightly Israeli crimes against Palestinians. The targets of his critical analysis include the frequent public pronouncements of Cornel West, a flamboyant public intellectual who has held academic appointments at Harvard, Princeton and Union Theological Seminary.

Bellerose advanced a theory of why Dr. Salaita’s volume is supposedly cited often by Native Studies professors. The reason, Bellerose posits, is that “Native Studies professors all over Canada and the United States, there’s a pile of them are Arab.” He offers no proof for this observation, one that would surprise me if true. Bellerose adds, “the scariest part is that the ones who are there [in Native Studies?] don’t have degrees in history.”

There are many ways to view this reference by Ryan Bellerose to the notion that Native American and Indigenous Studies units throughout North America are filling available faculty positions with “a pile of Arabs.” This suggestion plays on the amplification during the era of the Global War on Terror of widely aroused fears that “the West” is being assailed by the subversive infiltration of Arabs, a large percentage of whom are also Muslims.

The hiring and dehiring of Steven Salaita at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign provided a major theatre of interaction for many conflicting currents of opinion and power. For instance it provided a very clear focus for competing constituencies seeking to highlight contending claims that anti-Semitism and Islamophobia constitute the dominant scourge of prejudiced commentary in public discourse.

Quite clearly the University of Illinois did not come through the divisive episode unscathed. Philip Weiss, the founder and editor of Mondoweiss, wrote a headline for his own story on the matter explaining that the “Salaita Firing Turns into a ‘Catastrophe’ for University of Illinois.”

Sixteen departments at the University of Illinois condemned the administrative decision to fire Dr. Salaita. The American Association of University Professors, the AAUP, voted in 2015 to “censure” the University of Illinois for its handling of the Salaita affair. Five thousand faculty members worldwide signed a commitment never to set foot on the University of Illinois campus. As Dr. Warrior indicated, many of those 5,000 faculty members have affirmed that they would never agree to help out the University of Illinois if asked to contribute to tenure reviews.”

In the months and years that followed the Salaita affair, the number of candidates seeking available faculty positions at the University of Illinois dropped significantly. Many speakers scheduled to give presentations on campus cancelled their events. Cornel West was one of those that backed away from a guest lecture. Nineteen thousand individuals signed a petition calling for the reinstatement of Dr. Salaita.

Many Jewish faculty members, students and alumnus signed a joint letter abhorring Dr. Salaita’s termination before he had an opportunity to begin teaching. These signatories declared in their letter to Chancellor Phyllis Wise and to the Members of the Board of Trustees,

The firing of Dr. Salaita generated many critical letters from a wide array of correspondents as well as from representatives of associations like the American Historical Society, American Political Science Association, the American Anthropology Association, the Modern Language Association, Committee on Academic Freedom of the Middle East Studies Association of North America, California Scholars for Academic Freedom, American Arab Studies Association, and the Society of American Law Teachers.

Katherine M. Frank, Sulzbacher, Professor of Law at Columbia University, wrote to Chancellor Wise to comment on

The American Indian Studies Department at the U of Illinois was “eviscerated” following the administrative termination of the Salaita appointment. Most of the Department’s seven core faculty members were attracted to other institutions following the fiasco. In 2016 Dr. Warrior left the University of Illinois to move back to closer proximity to the Osage Nation. He did so by becoming the Hall Distinguished Professor of American Literature and Culture at the University of Kansas.

While there are many examples of battles won in support of academic freedom at the University of Illinois, the fact remains that the war was lost. The controversial Palestinian-American scholar was not reinstated. Moreover, after his stint in the Edward Said Chair of American Studies, the Israel Lobby demonstrated the extent of its imperial infiltration of higher education by blocking Dr. Salaita from obtaining professorial work at any institution. Dr. Salaita applied for academic positions on four continents but without success. He responded to this experience by the altering the course of his life’s journey to avoid “the indignities of a blacklist.”

In early 2019 Dr. Salaita turned a page by starting a job in the Washington DC area as a school bus driver. In a blog essay describing the transition, Dr. Salaita expressed both pain and an ambivalent sort of relief that he could escape some of the intellectual servitude plaguing his former profession. He explained,

No more civility or nuance or dispassion or objectivity or whatever term they’re using these days to impel obedience…. Like any person disavowed of reverence, I finally recognized the need to disappear into the system that destroyed me.”",conspiracy
1099,"Welcome to this week's FiercePharmaAsia report, which includes stories on Big Pharma's expansion in the region, a U.S. regulatory warning for a South Korean drugmaker, new results in Takeda and Myovant’s trial for relugolix to treat uterine fibroids and more.

AbbVie completed another phase of its Singapore manufacturing expansion by opening a new biologics unit that complements existing small molecule API production at the plant. The expansion of the facility in the Tuas Biomedical Park in Singapore is part of the company’s $320 million investment in the facility. The Chicago-based company announced in 2014 that it planned to build a 1.2 million-square-foot facility, but soon after bought a decommissioned contained API manufacturing plant that was already built, along with some additional buildings and extra equipment.

A body of evidence is building behind Takeda and Myovant’s hormonal therapy in uterine fibroids, with late-stage Japanese data reinforcing positive phase 2 results with the drug in the U.S. The latest phase 3 trial showed that the oral drug matched older uterine fibroid treatment leuprorelin acetate—which is given by a monthly injection—in alleviating symptoms. The 24-week trial enrolled 280 Japanese women with symptomatic uterine fibroids, benign tumors that originate in the uterus and can cause excessive menstrual bleeding and pain.

South Korean drugmaker Dasan E&T was slapped with a warning letter from the FDA based on an inspection earlier this year that found numerous testing and manufacturing issues at its plant. The agency said Dasan failed to adequately test raw materials and finished products to verify they conformed to appropriate specifications.

4. Takeda is expanding its EU presence while AstraZeneca talks of pulling production from U.K.

Japan's Takeda will make another investment in its production operations in the European Union. The company will invest up to €100 million in a new manufacturing plant at its site in Clondalkin near Dublin, Ireland, that could eventually add 100 jobs to its operations there, The Times reported. The outlay is for a 3,000-square-meter, (32,292-square-foot) two-story manufacturing plant next to an existing facility at the Grange Castle business park, the newspaper said.

5. Judge tosses U.S. lawsuit against GSK from private eyes imprisoned in China

GlaxoSmithKline, which has worked hard to put 2013’s China bribery scandal behind it, got an assist from a U.S. judge in that department. U.S. District Judge Nitza Quiñones Alejandro in Philadelphia tossed out a lawsuit from a husband-and-wife team of former private eyes, Reuters reports.

340,"Chairman of park society wanted to document police misconduct, but was told he had breached Section 44 of the Terrorism Act

Despite police claiming that an ambiguous section of the UK Counter Terrorism Act of 2008 would not outlaw taking photographs or film of police, a man was detained as a terror suspect this week simply for taking a photograph of a police car in order to document police misconduct.

62-year-old Malcolm Sleath, who is chairman of his local park society, saw a police car driving erratically down a North London park footpath, despite the fact that by law police are supposed to investigate on foot in such circumstances.

He began filming the police car to document the misconduct so that he could later present it to the chief sergeant.

Sleath was subsequently approached by the two officers in the car and was told he was being detained because he had breached Section 44 of the Terrorism Act.

“(The officer) was clearly embarrassed to be photographed where he shouldn’t have been and wanted to intimidate me,” said Sleath.

Section 44 previously only allowed police officers to stop and search somebody on “reasonable grounds” but that has now been changed and is no longer necessary, leading to an explosion in frivolous stop and search incidents. 44% of complaints made about stop and search allege assault by police officers.

However, the nature of Sleath’s detainment raises questions about whether police were actually enforcing 58A of the 2000 Terrorism Act, a passage replicated in the 2008 Counter Terrorism Act.

As we have previously highlighted, this section contains ambiguous language which suggests that merely filming or photographing police officers is an act of terrorism. When journalist organizations expressed fears that this law could effectively outlaw a huge part of their profession, they were told by PC Alan Cousins of the Metropolitan Police Film Unit that the law would not impede them.

Cousins stated that taking photos of police officers “would not be caught by this offence,” but added that it could be in “exceptional circumstances”.

In London, filming anything is treated as a sign of potential terrorism. We were filming floral tributes left at the entrance to Stockwell tube station where Jean Charles De Menezes was brutally gunned down by police in July 2005. We were approached by a police officer and subsequently entered into the terror database – ostensibly for filming flowers without permission from the government.

Britain has around 4.2 million CCTV cameras – one for every fourteen people – and Big Brother has carte blanche to watch us 24/7 – but woe betide we actually turn the camera back on the authorities, because that makes us a potential terrorist.

Indeed, a recent London Metropolitan Police poster campaign directly implied that filming a CCTV camera was a probable act of terrorism and encouraged people to report anyone for doing so.

The video below shows UK police threatening a man with reprisals for filming them, claiming that it is an offence to record the police. The cops phone the police station and are told that there is no law that forbids the public from filming them. However, this was two years ago, before the recent amendment to the law was passed.

933,"In 1891, the palaeontologist Erwin Barbour was walking through the White River Badlands of western Nebraska; a mosaic of parched grassland and slow-flowing rivulets that expose colourful layers of sedimentary rock. He was there to inspect a fossil that had baffled a local rancher.

After being led to the fossil's location, Barbour found himself just as puzzled. The fossil looked like a two-metre-tall corkscrew of stone, spiralling vertically into the landscape. It was like nothing he had seen before.

What was it? Barbour, head of the Department of Geology at the University of Nebraska, decided the fossil must be the remains of an extinct freshwater sponge, which he named Daemonelix or ""Demon's corkscrew"".

A couple of years later he was forced to rethink his conclusion. Other fossils from the same site did not fit with the idea that an ancient lake once covered the area. Barbour decided that Daemonelix was really the preserved root system of a giant tree. This was also wrong.

Thankfully, his contemporaries had other ideas. Edward Drinker Cope and Theodor Fuchs independently noticed that, inside a horizontal compartment preserved at the base of the helical fossils, were the ancient bones of a rodent. The devil corkscrews were not the remains of an extinct organism. They were ancient burrows that filled up with sand and silt.

In 1906, the rodents were identified as beavers that lived at the bottom of their deep, vertical burrows 22 million years ago, venturing above ground to feed on the lush steppes of North America. They were named Palaeocastor, literally meaning ""prehistoric beaver"". But they were not the only beavers of prehistory.

In fact, in times past the beaver family tree dripped in diversity. There were dozens of beaver species in all manner of forms and sizes, from blind burrowers to Ice Age giants. Today, though, that tree has been gnawed and stripped of most of its branches. Just two species remain. How and why did the beavers rise – and what precipitated their spectacular fall?

With incisors that renew throughout life, beavers are part of an early radiation of rodents that emerged between 40 and 35 million years ago. At this time, the warm and wet greenhouse world of the Eocene period was beginning to cool.

The forests of the Arctic receded southwards and the thick canopy was reduced to a carpet of grass. Rodents took full advantage, filling nearly every ecological niche available. Small and nimble, they ran, climbed, and bred into new lifestyles.

But beavers took a different tack. ""From their origin they're pretty big,"" says geologist Samantha Hopkins of the University of Oregon in Eugene. This came at a cost.

""Rodents in general are made for everything else to eat,"" says Hopkins. ""As a palaeontologist who studies rodents, I study everything's lunch."" Their greater size meant that ancient beavers would have been particularly tempting targets for the predators of yore.

To take themselves off the menu, they hid. Soon after their emergence in North America, the beaver family tree split in two. One branch took to the water and the other went underground.

It sounds contradictory today, but early in their evolution beavers really benefited from a lack of trees.

""They were some of the first animals to take advantage of open habitats,"" says Joshua Samuels of East Tennessee State University. ""They really dove right into it.""

In addition to the Palaeocastor fossils discovered in Nebraska, there were at least 15 species of beavers digging their homes into the soft sandy ground of North America between 32 and 20 million years ago. At one site called the Harrison Formation in South Dakota, there were no fewer than eight species living similar lives, in the same place and at the same time.

""They were some of the most abundant animals in basically all the places they lived in North America,"" says Samuels. ""A prairie dog town is a good analogue… They were very, very common.""

Their ubiquity might even explain why some beavers dug such odd vertically-spiralled burrows. As Larry Martin and Debra Bennett of the University of Kansas concluded in 1977: ""The high density of the burrows… permits the digging of a very deep vertical burrow which occupies little horizontal space."" Like our tower blocks, the burrows were an adaptation to city life.

From the distinctive marks they left on the inside of helical burrows, Martin and Bennett also demonstrated that these beavers dug with their protruding teeth, not with their claws as was previously assumed. They wrote: ""when scraped through soft, moist sand they leave a broad flat groove with a slight ridge down the centre where the incisors do not quite meet.""

Out of the 500 fossil burrows they examined, 50% twisted in a clockwise direction and 50% were anticlockwise, opening up the possibility that some beavers were right-toothed and some left-toothed.

While Palaeocastor dug with its teeth, other species used their strong front limbs and flattened heads as shovels.

One group, known as Euhapsis, became so attuned to a life underground that they may have become blind. Certainly, their skulls show all the signs. ""[They have] a reduced optic canal, and an anatomy that points to it being really a subterranean animal like blind mole-rats,"" says Samuels.

Unlike the beavers that left the comfort of their home to feed on the grasslands above, Euhapsis would have fed on bulbous roots and tubers underground, never seeing or sensing the Sun above. Both life and death were dark.

Specialisation may have been the reason for the burrowing beavers' downfall, says Samuels. Being specialised tends to mean a species has a short ""lifespan"", because a sudden environmental change can remove the conditions that the specialism is best suited for.

As the climate chilled still further, and competition from other burrowing animals such as gophers and prairie dogs intensified, Palaeocastor and its kin went extinct. The last of the burrowing beavers literally dug their own graves 20 million years ago.

But as their burrowing cousins were dwindling, the semi-aquatic beavers boomed.

Sheltered from the worst of the weather within their watery habitats, they spread across North America, Europe and continental Asia. They often moved back and forth across the Bering land bridge between Canada and Russia.

One of the most exploratory was Steneofiber, a smaller version of modern-day beavers that swam and wandered across all three northern continents, using its long legs and feet for propulsion.

Just like the two beaver species alive today, Steneofiber had a sharpened claw on its hind foot. This would have been used for grooming its dense fur, and for spreading waterproofing oil called castoreum, which the beaver secreted from two sacs next to its genitals.

In 1995, researchers reported the discovery of a collection of 10 Steneofiber skeletons, all huddled together. Two were much larger than the rest, three had their first replacement teeth, and the other five were all tiny. It was a fossilised family of differing ages.

As early as 24 million years ago, as the burrowing beavers were dwindling, Steneofiber parents were investing heavily in their young ""kits"", making sure that they had the best chance at survival. It is the evolutionary equivalent of quality over quantity, and it pushed the semi-aquatic beavers further away from the norms of rodent-hood.

Rodents typically breed like rabbits, pumping out lots of offspring in the hope that a few will survive by sheer chance. Steneofiber did not.

Instead, as the temperature continued to drop, families of different age groups huddled together for warmth. They may have dug burrows into riverbanks, or built lodges as safe houses.

Even dams are not out of the question, says Samuels – although such assemblies of wood, mud, and moss rarely fossilise. The earliest dams yet found hail from three million years ago, uprooted from the peat bogs of a site called Beaver Pond on Ellesmere Island, Canada. The interwoven masses of sticks show the hallmark tooth marks of a semi-aquatic beaver species known as Dipoides.

And Dipoides was not the only ecosystem engineer. By 10 million years ago, the modern beavers of the Castor genus had evolved and were spreading from their origin in eastern Asia. With lodges, dams, and caches of food underneath the water's surface, these beavers insulated themselves from harsh winters.

Those winters would only get longer and colder.

The Pleistocene epoch – the period in Earth's history that began around two million years ago – can be defined by two main features. First, it was so cold that ice repeatedly spread far from the poles, covering much of North America, Europe and Asia. Second, mammals grew to mammoth sizes.

Some were literally mammoths. These woolly cousins of elephants roamed North America and Eurasia alongside whopping cave bears, giant sloths, and saber-toothed cats. They left footprints that their relatives living today cannot fill.

Beavers were no different. Weighing over 200kg and measuring up to 10ft (3m) from goofy tooth to tail, the giant beaver Castoroides was about the same size as a black bear.

""It was like a beaver on steroids,"" says William Korth of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in New York.

But size was not its only defining feature. Compared to modern Castor beavers, the giant beaver's tail was less paddle-like, and its hind legs and feet were much larger relative to its overall size. It was a big-foot beaver.

""It would have been a very awkward animal when on land,"" says Samuels. ""But in the water it would have been an amazing swimmer, more reminiscent of something like a seal or a sea lion.""

Did the giant beaver cut down giant trees, build vast dams, and trap huge volumes of water for its food and protection? A jumble of fossilised sticks from Canada, each apparently cut by Castoroides' banana-sized incisors, suggests so.

""Although they were not preserved in a dam-like structure, they occur in a cluster that looks very similar to what might be a dam,"" says Korth.

Today the giant beaver is no more. Along with most of North America's mega-sized animals, its branch was cut short at the end of the most recent glacial period, 10,000 years ago.

Did the world's climate change too fast? Did humans, who arrived in North America just a few thousand years before, ambush this awkward animal too often? Both are certainly possible, but there is an alternative explanation.

Castoroides was just one of many beavers to go extinct over the last 10 million years. Others include Dipoides, Steneofiber and another giant beaver from Europe called Trogontherium. It is possible that it was competition from the beavers that survive today – species in the genus Castor – that sealed the fate of the others.

Perhaps Castor beavered better than any other beaver had before.

It is a story that sounds oddly familiar to our own. In former times, the human family tree was vigorous and healthy, with many species spread across Europe, Asia and Africa – including the Neanderthals, ""hobbits"" and the mysterious Denisovans. But today only our species, Homo sapiens, remains.

""[Perhaps] beavers have done something similar,"" says Hopkins. ""The ecological role they evolved in the genus Castor may have filled the space that other species were in everywhere else. They sort of booted themselves out."" For now, though, this is only an idea.

Today there are only two species of beaver alive– the Eurasian and American – but both carry echoes of the formerly-grand beaver family tree.

Both species burrow into river and lake banks, just like Palaeocastor dug into the vast steppes of North America 22 million years ago. Both live in close-knit family groups like Steneofiber, caring for their kits until they reach adolescence.

Both are massive, for rodents; a reminder of the giant Ice Age beaver Castoroides. Only one rodent alive today is larger: South America's guinea-pig-like capybaras.

And both have had a brush with extinction. They were hunted for their thick fur, meat and castoreum, which is used in medicine and perfume, and were critically endangered by the 18th Century.

The problem was particularly acute in Europe.

By 1526, beavers were extinct in Britain. In many other European countries – Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland – the last beaver was trapped and killed by the 19th Century.

From an original stock of up to 400 million, the Eurasian beaver was reduced to just 1,200 individuals, isolated and vulnerable in eight out-of-touch populations.

In 1845, Norway introduced the first moratorium on hunting. Beavers started to rebound. Thanks to reintroductions in 25 European countries, the species has now reclaimed much of its former range.

With an estimated population of 639,000 individuals, the Eurasian beaver is now listed as ""least concern"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, as is its American cousin. But that is an overall view. Some isolated populations are still struggling.

In particular, the Sino-Mongolian beaver can only be found within the Ulungur watershed, which sprawls across China and Mongolia. This is ""an area little known to people outside this region,"" according to Hongjun Chu and Zhigang Jiang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Living under the shadow of Mount Altay and stretching into the deserts of Gurbantunggut and Gobi, this precarious population faces an onslaught of challenges.

For one, it is a harsh and unforgiving climate. The winter is six months long, and frost extends its icy touch far into the other seasons. Temperatures range from 34C above freezing to 50C below.

Of the little precipitation that falls, 33% is snow. Even when rain does fall, 90% evaporates into the thin high-altitude air.

Then there are the neighbours. The number of human settlements has more than doubled in the Ulungur watershed since 1989, and the population has increased by 71%, according to surveys taken in the 1980s and 2000s.

What's more, the local Mongol, Kazak, Han, and Uygur people are increasingly relying on wood-burning stoves for energy. This means they are competing with beavers for Poplar trees.

The Sino-Mongolian beaver population is ""partially protected"" by the Bulgan Beaver Nature Reserve. But Chu and Jiang say more needs to be done to protect the beavers, and to help the local people find alternative energy sources.

So while Eurasian beaver populations elsewhere are enjoying a resurgence, the future for these beavers of the desert is less clear. With the right care and attention, they might trundle on. Or they could soon join their ancient relatives, becoming just another branch that has been gnawed off the beaver family tree.

304,"In Disney's new live-action-meets-CGI movie adaptation of ""The Jungle Book,"" the feral child Mowgli meets a giant ape named King Louie. Although Louie looks like a giant orangutan, the character design was actually based on a huge primate called Gigantopithecus who once inhabited prehistoric India.

Why include an extinct ape in a modern story? When Disney created the 1967 animated classic film on which this year's film is based, the animators wanted to stay as true to Indian flora and fauna as possible while creating a new character not found in Rudyard Kipling's original 1894 collection of stories. However, orangutans weren't native to India — but Gigantophithecus was, if even only in the past.

Now extinct, the largest Gigantopithecus was Gigantopithecus blacki. It was estimated to be more than 10 feet (3 meters) tall and weigh more than 1,200 pounds (544 kilograms), characteristics scientists pieced together after discovering teeth and jaw bones belonging to the species in the wilds of China, Vietnam and India, as well as traditional apothecaries that sold primate molars.

Large primates are still spotted across the globe. Whatever name you know them by — bigfoot, yeti, sasquatch — the lore surrounding these mythological creatures may be tied to a real giant ape that roamed parts of southern Asia about 12 million years ago.

Could a remnant Gigantopithecus be behind modern bigfoot sightings? ""It seems very unlikely,"" says David Mizejewski, naturalist, author, wildlife expert and co-host of several NatGeo television series. ""We have precious little physical evidence of Gigantopithecus (aside from jaw bones and teeth) and much of what we think we know about it could change with the discovery of additional fossils. It seems, though, that they were extinct long before modern times and there's no evidence of them in North America. Perhaps ancient humans in Asia did encounter them and formed legends of giant apes that survive in human cultures today.""

Although Gigantopithecus may not be the answer to sasquatch sightings, clues about its demise could be key to preserving other species of living apes. In a new study published in the journal Quaternary International, professor Friedmann Schrenk and his colleagues at the Senckenberg Research Institute in Germany examined the giant ape's fossilized tooth enamel to make determinations about its diet and how this might have impacted its extinction.

""Our results indicate that the large primates only lived in the forest and obtained their food from this habitat,"" says Herve Bocherens of the Senckenberg Center for Human Evolution and Palaeoenvironment at the University of Tubingen, which contributed to the study.

As the climate changed and forested areas became savannas, food became scarce and the giant apes eventually died off.

""The wildlife either adapted, moved to new areas or suffered decline or extinctions,"" Mizejewski says. ""This has happened to countless species over the history of life on Earth.""

And it could be happening now. ""All modern apes are listed as endangered,"" Mizejewski says, ""and a major reason for that is destruction of their habitat. Basically, humans are drastically altering the apes' habitat by logging, burning or converting it to agriculture. This human-caused habitat loss is, of course, happening far faster than habitat loss through natural factors, but the result is the same.""",mainstream

I dreaded having to sit there and listen to talk radio. But it wasn’t long before I started to fall in love with Rush Limbaugh. I would look forward to listening to him and even did so when my dad was not around.

Rush helped me find common ground with my dad. Before Rush, I thought my dad and I were so different. Listening to Rush, I realized that while my dad and I differed on some things, at the core we were very much in agreement on the things in life that really mattered. I remember my first job out of college and going out to my car on my lunch hour just to listen to Rush Limbaugh.

I remember after my dad died a few years ago I was in my car and I turned on the radio and heard the Rush theme music and then Rush’s voice. It was such a comfort to me in a time of sorrow to hear that familiar voice and sense of humor.

67,"Albert Ostman (circa 1893 – 1975)[1] was a Canadian prospector who reported that he was abducted by a Sasquatch and held captive for six days.[2] He stated that the event took place near Toba Inlet, British Columbia in 1924.

In 1924, Albert Ostman, a lumberjack and woodsman, went to the area for a vacation. Ostman had heard stories about the ""man beasts"" who supposedly roamed these woods but refused to believe them.[3] As Ostman lay asleep one evening a Sasquatch purportedly picked him up and carried him off while he was in his sleeping bag.[4] Ostman was carried in his sleeping bag across country for 3 hours by the Sasquatch[5]. The Sasquatch dropped Ostman down on a plateau. Standing around him was a family of 4 of the creatures.[6] Albert was kept captive by the Sasquatch. The captors were 3 adults and a child which held Ostman captive for six days.[citation needed] One of the Bigfoots was reported as being 8 feet tall.[7] Ostman did not use his gun on them as they had done him no harm.[8] He stayed with the Bigfoot family for a week.[9] Ostman ate ""sweet tasting grass"" that they gave him.[10] According to Ostman the female Sasquatch washed and stacked leaves.[11] Albert escaped by making the large male Sasquatch groggy by feeding him some snuff.[12] He did not tell his story for more than 24 years after it happened for fear of being thought of as crazy.[13] As more Sasquatch stories appeared in the press Albert decided to tell his story to a local newspaper, The Province, in 1957.[14]

On August 20, 1957, police magistrate A.M. Naismith wrote an affidavit which states ""...I found Mr. Ostman to be a man of sixty-four years of age; in full possession of his mental faculties.

454,"Our very earliest, rodentlike ancestors likely trod the earth some 200 million years ago on tiny, flat feet. As the posture of those feet evolved, so, too, did the size of mammals, according to a new study, giving rise to everything from the tip-toed African lion to the relatively flat-footed human.

“It’s an excellent paper,” says Christofer Clemente, an expert on the evolution of locomotion at the University of the Sunshine Coast in Australia, who wasn’t involved in the work. “It’s a really clever idea to link these things.”

To conduct the study, Manabu Sakamoto, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom; Tai Kubo, a paleontologist at the University of Tokyo; and colleagues assembled a data set of 880 living mammal species and their foot posture. The team divided the postures into three major categories: plantigrade (flat-footed), digitigrade (tiptoed), or unguligrade (hooved).

Most animals were relatively easy to place: Humans and mice are flat-footed, dogs and cats are tiptoed, horses and bison are hooved. Others presented challenges. Elephants and rhinoceroses, for example, have hooves, but don’t distribute their weight like horses do. Elephants bear their great weight on their heels, earning them a place in the flat-footed category, whereas rhinos actually walk on the balls of their feet, putting them in the tiptoed category.

Next, the researchers plotted these species on a family tree that traces the branching evolutionary history of all known mammalian life. They filled in the likely foot postures of extinct animals based on their relationships with the living species from their data set. Their model suggests the earliest ancestral mammal was probably flat-footed, they report today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

But size was the biggest surprise: On average, tiptoed mammals tend to be about twice as massive as flat-footed mammals, and hooved animals are typically even bigger—a whopping 57 times more massive than tiptoed ones.

There are of course outliers: Flat-footed elephants are the most massive terrestrial mammals on Earth, for example, and tiptoed dogs and cats are smaller than flat-footed humans. But the overall trend held. When the scientists mapped these changes to branch points on their phylogenetic tree—say, when the ancestor that gave rise to warthogs, elk, and giraffes evolved to walk on hooves instead of tiptoes—they found there was virtually always a rapid increase in body size.

“Throughout evolution, increases in body size tend to come in bursts at these transition points,” Sakamoto says. “It’s not a gradual thing.”

That suggests one of two possibilities: Foot posture allowed mammals to move into and flourish in new ecological niches in which being big was an advantage. Or foot posture evolved as a result of animals becoming more massive in the first place. Which came first—the hoof or the heft—remains an open question, Sakamoto says. He believes adding fossil mammals to their model in future studies could help clear up the direction of the evolutionary arrow.

“These conclusions all fit together for me, and make a lot of sense overall,” says John Hutchinson, who studies biomechanics at the Royal Veterinary College in London.

The answer could shed light on other evolutionary mysteries, Clemente adds. “If we can better understand the link between body size and posture we can go back in time … and answer questions like, ‘How did the dinosaurs get so big?’ which would be really exciting.”",mainstream
1231,"Here's Why 'Bigfoot Erotica' Is at the Center of a Congressional Race in Virginia

The 2018 midterm elections have been fraught with headline-making controversies, but the race in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District has brought a particularly unusual topic to prominence: “Bigfoot erotica.”

Cockburn, a 65-year-old former investigative journalist, tweeted an image from Riggleman’s Instagram of a naked drawing of the mythical creature Bigfoot with a black “censored” box over his crotch. Cockburn also alleged that Riggleman is aligned with a white supremacist.

“My opponent Denver Riggleman, running mate of Corey Stewart, was caught on camera campaigning with a white supremacist. Now he has been exposed as a devotee of Bigfoot erotica,” Cockburn wrote. “This is not what we need on Capitol Hill.”

Riggleman, a former Air Force veteran and brewery owner who has written a book on Bigfoot, denied all the charges in an interview with CNN, claiming Cockburn’s suggestion that he has a “sexual interest in Bigfoot” was “absurd” and explaining that his comments on the subject were rooted in an ongoing joke with former military friends.

In addition to writing a self-published book called Bigfoot Exterminators, Inc.: The Partially Cautionary, Mostly True Tale of Monster Hunt 2006, Riggleman has written multiple social media posts focusing on Bigfoot and the creature’s genitalia.

Cockburn shared another one of Riggleman’s posts that featured a nude drawing of Big Foot with a picture of Riggleman’s face pasted over the creature’s head.

“My ‘buddies’ thought this pic was fitting for my birthday next week and to celebrate my new book release in about a month or 2… ‘Mating Habits of Bigfoot and Why Women Want Him…”, Riggleman captioned the post.

The “Bigfoot erotica” controversy throws a new obstacle into Cockburn’s campaign to win Virginia’s 5th congressional district, which has long been dominated by Republicans (Donald Trump in 2016, Mitt Romney in 2012, and Ed Gillespie in the 2017 gubernatorial race). He has also come under fire for his ties to white nationalism.

Riggleman has campaigned alongside neo-confederate Corey Stewart, a Republican Senate candidate for Virginia who publicly endorsed Paul Nehlen, a white supremacist and former congressional candidate in Wisconsin. Cockburn’s tweet referred to Riggleman being caught campaigning with Isaac Smith, co-founder of a white nationalist group called “Unity & Security for America.” Riggleman has denied Cockburn’s claims that he was “caught on camera campaigning with a white supremacist” and that he was a “devotee of Bigfoot erotica.” He also recently wrote an op-ed The Roanoke Times denouncing neo-Nazis as “cultural parasites.”

“Check out this video on my research into the Bigfoot myth. I sure don’t know what Bigfoot Erotica is, @LeslieCockburn knows more about that than I do apparently – but I can talk about Bigfoot theories all day,” the candidate tweeted.",mainstream
1144,"Without Roseanne, it would appear “The Conners” is doomed.

This new version on ABC depicting the working class blue-collar clan is a poor substitute to what was once an endearing show.

Without their star attraction throwing out self-abasing edgy and hilarious one-liners, “The Connors” is merely another run-of-the-mill sitcom depicting another mundane TV family attempting to cope with life.

“The Conners” has thus far dropped over 35% in total viewership compared to the “Roseanne” reboot debut earlier this year, which scored an astounding 18.2 million viewers.

The new show sparked some interest among viewers when ABC announced that it would kill off the Barr character, however not enough to make a substantial difference within the ratings.

The World Series on Fox between the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers led the night with 13.76 million viewers, followed by NBC in second place, with CBS and ABC tied for third.

ABC took a major gamble when they decided to reboot and dust off the original classic sitcom, which ran from 1988 to 1997 with its original cast of actors.

“Roseanne” debuted early this year, and immediately became an instant hit, until she made a fatal career-ending mistake, by going on Twitter in the wee hours of the morning, under the influence of prescribed medication and tweeted out a racial-slur, regarding former Barack Obama aide Valerie Jarrett. The racist tweet quickly went viral.

Roseanne realizing she had made a monumental mistake in judgment, attempted to walk-back her remarks, apologizing personally to Jarrett and several times to the general public.

However unlike her celebrity Hollywood counterparts, who’ve said considerably worse, Barr is a committed Trump supporter, therefore deserves no second chance. And within a matter of days, the 65-year old outspoken conservative was fired from ABC, and her popular sitcom taken off the air.

Barr appeared on the “Dr. Oz Show” soon after she was fired: “I don’t want to be around, because, you know, I’ll get drawn into a negative thing of defending myself, or being angry for being mischaracterized.”

Adding; “You know, I don’t … I want to stay away from it. I want to stay in a joyous, positive, happy place that I’ve worked my way to again in my life.”

The comedic actress is currently living in Israel and is planning to study “learn and speak Hebrew fluently.”

“I want to be able to learn and speak Hebrew fluently, because, you know, I read very slowly,” Barr explained. “I know the letters and I love the letters, but I want to speak it. And also I have quite a few teachers over the years that live there and I want to study.”

However when Barr learned that her character would be killed off by overdosing on drugs, she couldn’t hold back her anger; “Oh ya, they killed her. They have her die of an opioid overdose,” the comedian confided to host Brandon Straka on his show “Walk Away.”

Adding: “So it wasn’t enough to do what they did to me (fire me),” they had to so cruelly insult the people who loved that family and that show. There’s nothing I can do about it. It’s done. It’s over. There’s no fight left.”

If there’s one silver lining to this sad saga, it’s that ABC in their unbridled hast in firing Barr will never recapture the rating bonanza that “Roseanne” provided to the network, and certainly not with this poor substitute.",conspiracy

338,"Supination and pronation are parts of a stride. Supination occurs when weight is placed on the outside of the foot while walking or running. When the opposite happens, and a person shifts their weight from the heel to the forefoot, it is termed pronation. Excessive supination (underpronation) and excessive pronation (overpronation) can cause problems with the body’s alignment and lead to pain in the feet, knees, hips, and back. Read on to discover treatments and preventive techniques for people who supinate excessively.
• Too much supination can cause problems, such as pain and soreness.
• Most people with excessive supination have structural issues in their feet.

Weight placed on the outside of the foot is known as supination.

Image credit: Esther max, 2016 People who pronate excessively roll their foot inward, causing the outer part of the heel to make contact with the ground and the feet to flatten too much. Those who supinate do not roll their foot inward enough. This puts a strain on the ankle and can cause the ankle to roll outward, which leads to injury. Excessive supination is less common than excessive pronation.

The structural problems of the feet causing supination are usually inherited. However, external factors can also play a role in the condition. Traits that affect the mechanics of the feet and legs are often inherited, such as:
• leg length (including differences between the length of the legs) The shape of the foot’s arch may also increase the risk of supination, with runners with high arches being more prone to supination than other people. Good shoes support the arch and soft tissues of the foot, which help protect the foot from injury. This is especially true when walking on hard and flat surfaces. The wrong type of shoe — such as rigid or tight shoes — can lead to supination and other foot problems. Also, wearing shoes that are worn out or have no arch support causes supination. If the body is not correctly aligned, some parts must work harder to support posture and maintain balance. Similarly, poor form when exercising can cause some muscles and bones to overcompensate, leading to supination. Old injuries can cause instability and weakness in the bones and soft tissues of the body. People with achilles tendonitis, for example, are especially at risk of supination. Some of the other factors that can result in supination include:

The following techniques can help indicate excessive supination of the foot: In people with a neutral gait — where there is neither supination nor excessive pronation — the soles of the shoe will wear down from the outer edge of the heel toward the center. Supination can cause more obvious signs of wear on the outside edge only. Wetting bare feet and stepping onto a flat surface can help determine gait problems. To carry out this test:
• Step firmly onto a suitable surface that will show the footprint. The best surfaces include concrete tile or a brown paper bag.
• Step off and examine the footprint. If half the arch is visible in the footprint, it suggests a normal gait. If only a fraction of the arch is visible — or none at all — it suggests supination. A podiatrist or physical therapist can carry out a gait analysis, which involves a person walking or running on a specialized platform. People who are experiencing any of the symptoms or complications of excessive supination, or who see signs of supination after examining their old shoes or wet footprints, should have a gait analysis test.

Supination of the foot can be prevented or corrected with the following: For people who supinate, choosing flexible and lightweight running shoes is recommended. Flexible and lightweight running shoes are best for people who supinate. It can be helpful to consult a podiatrist first who can recommend the best type of shoe for supination.
• Measure both feet in terms of length, width, and depth to get the best fit.
• Wear the same style of sock that will be worn with the new shoes (for example, running socks).
• Look for extra-cushioning, arch support, and a roomy toe-box.
• Go shopping at the end of the day, when feet are at their largest.
• Do not choose tight-fitting shoes in the hope that they will stretch in time. People should replace their running shoes regularly. A good rule of thumb is to replace athletic shoes every 6 months, or more frequently if they show signs of wear and tear on the soles. Insoles designed for supination can support the arch and heel to control the motion of the foot. Orthotics for supination can be purchased in stores and online or can be custom-made by a podiatrist. It is important to correct poor posture and improper running techniques to address excess supination. When running or walking, try to land softly on the feet and aim to make contact with the ground close to the midfoot, rather than at the heel. It is best to land with a flat foot and to avoid curving the toes. A short stride often makes it easier to keep proper form when running and walking. A physical therapist can help to loosen tight muscles and tendons while strengthening these soft tissues. This assists in better weight distribution throughout the body, which corrects supination.

Although supination and pronation are a natural part of movement, too much of either motion can lead to an uneven gait and result in complications, such as pain, swelling, and misalignment. Proper footwear, using orthotic inserts, and engaging in regular stretching can all help. If a person experiences pain or swelling in the foot or ankle that lasts for more than a few days, they should see a doctor who can perform a gait analysis to check for supination. The doctor may also carry out further tests to rule out other foot and leg conditions.",mainstream

1193,"JP Morgan’s credit rating would be much lower without government backing.

JPMorgan benefited from the assumption that there’s a “very high likelihood” the U.S. government would back the bank’s bondholders and creditors if it defaulted on its debt, according to the statement. Without the implied federal backing, JPMorgan’s long-term deposit rating would have been three levels lower and its senior debt would have dropped two more steps, Moody’s said.

And as the editors of Bloomberg pointed out a couple of weeks ago:

JPMorgan receives a government subsidy worth about $14 billion a year, according to research published by the International Monetary Fundand our own analysis of bank balance sheets. The money helps the bank pay big salaries and bonuses. More important, it distorts markets, fueling crises such as the recent subprime-lending disaster and the sovereign-debt debacle that is now threatening to destroy the euro and sink the global economy.

With each new banking crisis, the value of the implicit subsidy grows. In a recent paper, two economists — Kenichi Ueda of the IMF and Beatrice Weder Di Mauro of the University of Mainz — estimated that as of 2009 the expectation of government support was shaving about 0.8 percentage point off large banks’ borrowing costs. That’s up from 0.6 percentage point in 2007, before the financial crisis prompted a global round of bank bailouts.

To estimate the dollar value of the subsidy in the U.S., we multiplied it by the debt and deposits of 18 of the country’s largest banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. The result: about $76 billion a year. The number is roughly equivalent to the banks’ total profits over the past 12 months, or more than the federal government spends every year on education.

JPMorgan’s share of the subsidy is $14 billion a year, or about 77 percent of its net income for the past four quarters. In other words, U.S. taxpayers helped foot the bill for the multibillion-dollar trading loss that is the focus of today’s hearing. They’ve also provided more direct support: Dimon noted in a recent conference call that the Home Affordable Refinancing Program, which allows banks to generate income by modifying government-guaranteed mortgages, made a significant contribution to JPMorgan’s earnings in the first three months of 2012.",conspiracy
1292,"Uganda's growing debt is sustainable, and the country is not at risk of losing state assets to China, the country's finance minister, Matia Kasaija, said this week.

Uganda's auditor-general warned in a report released this month that public debt from June 2017 to 2018 had increased from $9.1 billion to $11.1 billion.

The report — without naming China — warned that conditions placed on major loans were a threat to Uganda's sovereign assets.

It said that in some loans, Uganda had agreed to waive sovereignty over properties if it defaults on the debt — a possibility that Kasaija rejected.

""China taking over assets? … in Uganda, I have told you, as long as some of us are still in charge, unless there is really a catastrophe, and which I don't see at all, that will make this economy going behind. So, ... I'm not worried about China taking assets. They can do it elsewhere, I don't know. But here, I don't think it will come,"" he said.

China is one of Uganda's biggest country-lenders, with about $3 billion in development projects through state-owned banks.

China's Exim Bank has funded about 85 percent of two major Ugandan power projects — Karuma and Isimba dams. It also financed and built Kampala's $476 million Entebbe Express Highway to the airport, which cuts driving time by more than half. China's National Offshore Oil Corporation, France's Total, and Britain's Tullow Oil co-own Uganda's western oil fields, set to be tapped by 2021.

Economist Fred Muhumuza says China's foot in Uganda's oil could be one way it decides to take back what is owed.

""They might determine the price, as part of recovering their loan,"" he said. ""By having a foot in there they will say fine, we are going to pay you for oil. But instead of giving you $60 a barrel, you owe us. We'll give you $55. The $5 you are paying the old debt. But we are reaching a level where you don't see this oil being an answer to the current debt problem.""

Uganda's worries about China seizing national assets are not the first in Africa.

A leaked December report in Kenya showed China was promised parts of Mombasa Port as collateral for financing a $3 billion railway it built from the port to Nairobi. Both Chinese and Kenyan officials have denied that the port's ownership is at risk.

Reports in September that China was taking over Zambia's state power company over unpaid debt rippled across Africa, despite government denials.

But the fear of a Chinese takeover of a sovereign state's assets over debt is not completely without merit. Struggling to pay back loans to state-owned Chinese firms, Sri Lanka in 2017 handed over a strategic port.",mainstream
774,"A ""Nature"" with a bit of a difference. Instead of looking at rare species and conservation measures, this week's programme focuses on perhaps the most elusive (if not non-existent) creature of all - Bigfoot, the supposed ape like or hominid creature that people believe lives in the North West of the United States.

The 29-year-old Loose Women star looks utterly besotted with her new baby - who she welcomed into the world just ten days ago.

Taking to Instagram on Saturday evening, Stacey showed off her baby boy as he snuggled into her - and she sounded both proud and envious of her little bundle of joy.

780,"South African Author, Scientist, Researcher and Explorer Michael Tellinger (often called ‘The South African Indiana Jones’) shows off what could be one of the best pieces of evidence that there were once giants living on Earth a long, long time ago.

Geologists have been marveling at this giant foot print in rough granite, about 4 feet long. Some still say that it is a natural erosion pattern, but for now it’s hard to say.

Prof. Pieter Wagener from UPE, suggests that “there is a higher probability of little green men arriving from space and licking it out with their tongues, than being created by natural erosion.”

It is located in South Africa, near the town of Mpaluzi, close to the Swaziland border.

It is estimated to be between 200 million and 3 Billion years old because of our current understanding of the formation of granites in Earth’s history. This dating immediately causes great debate and argument – so I urge you to keep your mind open and focused on the evidence.

This amazing footprint in granite was discovered in 1912 by a hunter called Stoffel Coetzee, while hunting in the remote area. At the time this was a deeply remote part of South Africa known as the Eastern Transvaal, teeming with wildlife, including antelope and lions.

It remains in the same condition as it was when first discovered and the possibility that this was a carved hoax is extremely low because of its remote location.

Even today, it is difficult to find. The real mystery is how this amazing phenomenon occurred – I have no idea – but here it is and we cannot wish it away. YES – It is granite – it is a well recognised geological part of South Africa and recorded on all geological maps – that is why this footprint is such an incredible mystery.

It can be described as a “phenocrystic” granite, OR coarse porphyritic granite, that underwent several different stages of cooling. The result being an interesting mixture of large and small granules. This is why granite companies are keen to mine this area for granite because it will look really “pretty” when polished.

In the official Geology Of South Africa, this outcrop is called Mpuluzi Batholith (Granite) and the official dating of this rock produced dates of around 3,1 billion years.

This bone has been in the vaults of of the medical school at WITS University, Johannesburg since the early 1960s, when it was found by miners in a mine in northern Namibia. It is one of the most precious and rare specimens available today that clearly indicate the existence of giants in Southern Africa more than 40,000 years ago.

240,"There are places on Earth that are a little creepy, places that feel a little haunted and places that are downright hellish. The Darvaza gas crater, nicknamed by locals ""The Door to Hell,"" or ""The Gates of Hell,"" definitely falls into the latter category—and its sinister burning flames are just the half of it. Located in the Karakum Desert of central Turkmenistan (a little over 150 miles from the country's capital) the pit attracts hundreds of tourists each year. It also attracts nearby desert wildlife—reportedly, from time to time local spiders are seen plunging into the pit by the thousands, lured to their deaths by the glowing flames.

So how did this fiery inferno end up in the middle of a desert in Turkmenistan? In 1971, when the republic was still part of the Soviet Union, a group of Soviet geologists went to the Karakum in search of oil fields. They found what they thought to be a substantial oil field and began drilling. Unfortunately for the scientists, they were drilling on top of a cavernous pocket of natural gas which couldn't support the weight of their equipment. The site collapsed, taking their equipment along with it—and the event triggered the crumbly sedimentary rock of the desert to collapse in other places too, creating a domino-effect that resulted in several open craters by the time all was said and done.

The largest of these craters measures about 230-feet across and 65-feet deep. Reportedly, no one was injured in the collapse, but the scientists soon had another problem on their hands: the natural gas escaping from the crater. Natural gas is composed mostly of methane, which, though not toxic, does displace oxygen, making it difficult to breathe. This wasn't so much an issue for the scientists, but for the animals that call the Karakum Desert home—shortly after the collapse, animals roaming the area began to die. The escaping methane also posed dangers due to its flammability—there needs to be just five percent methane in the air for an explosion to potentially take place. So the scientists decided to light the crater on fire, hoping that all the dangerous natural gas would burn away in a few weeks' time.

It's not as outlandish as it sounds—in oil and natural gas drilling operations, this happens all the time to natural gas that can't be captured. Unlike oil, which can be stored in tanks indefinitely after drilling, natural gas needs to be immediately processed—if there's an excess of natural gas that can't be piped to a processing facility, drillers often burn the natural gas to get rid of it. It's a process called ""flaring,"" and it wastes almost a million dollars of worth of natural gas each day in North Dakota alone.

But unlike drillers in North Dakota or elsewhere, the scientists in Turkmenistan weren't dealing with a measured amount of natural gas—scientists still don't know just how much natural gas is feeding the burning crater—so what was supposed to be a few-week burn has turned into almost a half-century-long desert bonfire.

After visiting the crater in 2010, Turkmenistan's president Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, worried that the fire would threaten the country's ability to develop nearby gas fields, ordered local authorities to come up with a plan for filling the crater in. No action has been taken, however, and the crater continues to burn, attracting unsuspecting wildlife and international tourists.

To visit the Darvaza gas crater, it's best to go at night, when the fire can be seen from miles away. The crater is located about 161 miles (about a 4 hour drive) from the Turkmen capital Ashgabat. Tours can be booked through agents in Ashgabat. Alternatively, some companies offer more structured tours of the surrounding area, with the Darvaza crater included (such as this tour, by The Geographical Society of New South Wales).",mainstream
605,"In this day and age, mass media critics do not evaluate movies by their artistic merit, but by the direction of their political message. To be deemed “good”, a movie needs to check a list of “agenda” boxes. Well, Joker does not check any boxes and it also goes against the grain. It is an uncompromising piece of art that is more akin to a low-budget auteur film than a DC Comics blockbuster. And, through its deeply unsettling character study of a “loser” who turns into a famous murderer, the movie provides a scattering critique of mass media.

Apparently, media sources did not appreciate the subversive messages in the movie and were quick to deem Joker “problematic”. Even before the official release of the movie, countless news articles associated Joker with “angry white men” and feared it would inspire Joker-copycats who would perpetrate mass shootings. Judging by the insistence of these articles, it was as if mass media was actually looking to speak into existence such as shooter by guaranteeing immediate and worldwide coverage of such an event. Appropriately enough, the movie addresses this exact brand of mass media perversion.

Indeed, on several occasions, the movie highlights the role of mass media in the creation and the validation of the monster that is Joker. And, on a wider scale, the movie links this media coverage to an uprising of the masses who identify the Joker as their hero and leader. In fact, while Joker is a bad guy, the bigger bad guy in the movie is mass media.

And real-life mass media did not appreciate the critique.

While most “serious” movie publications praised Joker, mass media sources bashed it senseless. They really did not want people to watch it. Here are some examples:

As it is often the case nowadays with new releases that do not “agree” with the agenda, there’s a wide gap between ratings from media critics and regular viewers.

If one actually spends time reading these critics, one cannot help but sense intense insincerity and hypocrisy from its authors. Because, whether or not one agrees with the movie’s message, Joker is, objectively, a well-constructed movie. It is well shot, well-acted and it excels in whatever other criteria movie critics are paid to analyze. However, all of this objective analysis is bypassed because the message of the movie does not follow the narrative sold by these news publications on a daily basis.

It is as if the bosses of these movie critics barged in their cubicle and yelled:

So, why exactly does mass media hate Joker? Because Joker hates mass media.

Joker is mainly about Arthur Pleck, the human behind the makeup. And Arthur is a sad, aging man whose life has always been characterized by abuse, rejection, and humiliation – all of which are amplified by a debilitating mental illness.

However, Arthur’s status as an eternal victim changes drastically when two events happen in his life: He stops taking his medication and, more importantly, he obtains a gun. After getting severely beat down by three drunk Wall Street types in the subway, Arthur pulls out his gun and shoots them all.

Mass media immediately picks up the story and builds up Joker as a “vigilante hero” who stands up to the rich and powerful. Of course, Joker revels in that attention as he finally gets an audience for his unique brand of “performance art”. In one scene of the many scenes that emphasize the role of mass media in creating a monster, Arthur is surrounded by people reading the newspaper with Joker on the front page. Soon after, Joker becomes the face of a widespread uprising in the city as legions of people riot while wearing clown masks.

Joker’s notoriety then reaches yet another level due to mass media. A popular TV talk show invites Arthur as a guest to make fun of his disastrous stand-up performances. Arthur goes on stage as Joker and ends up shooting the host (played by Robert DeNiro) live on TV, prompting massive media coverage. This leads to further notoriety and adulation by his legions of fans.

This is where things become “problematic” for the real-life mass media: The rioters in the movie, those who worship the Joker, are clearly associated with specific real-life groups. In several scenes, the protestors hold signs that say “Eat the Rich” and “Resist” – two slogans that are heavily used in actual protests by groups such as Antifa, Occupy Wall Street and others. The problem is: The media sources mentioned above are sympathetic to these movements because they are owned by the same globalist entities. In short, it makes them look bad.

Therefore, the rioters in the movie are associated with real-life globalist movements. And, as they walk around wearing clown masks, they hail Joker – a mass murderer who believes in nothing – as their hero. This is all due to mass media who built up the actions of a deranged man into something much bigger. To make things worse, these masked rioters even end up killing the parents of Bruce Wayne (who would end up becoming Batman) right in front of his eyes.

Considering these messages, one can begin to understand why sources such as The Guardian hated the movie. It goes against its entire narrative.

The movie also makes it clear that Joker is not, in any way, a hero. While most of the people he kills have wronged him in one way or another, these people still did not deserve a violent death. Also, he kills his own mother.

It is, however, the final scene of the movie (which happens immediately after he is lifted as a hero by the rioters) that cements Joker as an “evil” character. As we see him walking in a hospital hallway with blood under his feet, we realize that he killed a sweet social worker who did absolutely nothing to him. The hero of the protestors is actually a heartless monster.

Although Joker is a quintessential comic-book villain, the movie focused on his human side and portrayed him as a product of a toxic environment. The true villain in this movie is mass media which gave Joker all the praise and attention he always craved – but only after he murdered people. Media turned Arthur – a nobody – into Joker – a somebody. And the gullible people, those who consume mass media with no discernment, turned that Joker into a political leader.

With that being said, is Joker actually a full-fledged anti-elite and anti-establishment movie? Not really. Although it criticizes mass media, Joker remains a mass media product distributed by a major corporation. The story follows a wider trend in entertainment where the relatable protagonist is actually the bad guy whose past hardships somehow justify committing heinous acts of pure evil. In Joker, murder is performance art – it is a cathartic and liberating experience that is often immediately followed by big laughs. In short, the movie gives us more of the “fighting evil with more evil” narrative that’s been going on for years.

In the end, Joker offers an effective mirror of present-day society. Looking back at that mirror is a sad, mangled and depressed clown who believes in nothing and who needs tons of pills to function correctly. In this toxic environment, this clown only finds joy and liberation by sinking deeper into the moving sands of evil and depravity, under the constant encouragement of mass media. And, while this evil and depravity appear to bring him much-overdue glory and justice, all it truly accomplishes is to destroy all of the humanity that was left in him.

You see, for Hobbes and others, the terms “good” and “evil” were just synonyms for what humanity “desires” and for what we the people “hate” as individuals and as a collective. It was because of a human tendency that Hobbes believed that the individual should not be allowed to decide for themselves what is good and what evil. Therefore, collective disaster could only be averted by “delegating” to “higher” authority the task of deciding what’s best. Unfortunately for Hobbes and all his political theory kin, relinquishing such authority to other humans has led to calamity anyhow.

For most people, it matters little whether (or not) some “world order” runs their lives or not. The so-called “New World Order” used to be mentioned in wild stories about the famed Illuminati on the same pages that contained alleged pictures of Bigfoot or some bug-eyed alien. As I write this report, I am reminded of how Hollywood has immunized us all against Aliens, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and made the Wolf of Wallstreet a kind of dark hero. Now we’re confronted with a new truth. Conspiracies are as real and as commonplace as today’s news headlines. WikiLeaks reveals how a presidential candidate rigged a primary election. A U.S. soldier drops a dime on inhuman crimes committed in the name of freedom and democracy. A young geek working for the NSA spills the beans on massive breaches of Americans’ rights to privacy. A German carmaker tweaks an auto line’s onboard computers to lie to consumers and governments. And trillions of dollars just evaporate with no accounting! But the Illuminati running the show is a crazy conspiracy theory?

British writer and futurist H. G. Wells redefined the term “new world order” for us by describing the establishment of a technocratic world state and a planned economy that would transform society into a kind of peaceful utopia. Wells’ foresight was at one end of the spectrum, while evangelist Pat Robertson in his 1991 best-selling book The New World Order envisaged this new order as a vestige of the coming antichrist. To be sure, two extremes exist on either side of whatever mechanics control our systems today, but the fact that former UK PM Gordon Brown and the notorious Dr. Henry Kissinger used the “new world order” terminology to brand a reformed global financial system bears noting here. These two killers called for a new Bretton Woods that would certainly do in individual and national freedoms. Brown’s role for the new order was to assist in destroying economies before and during the Great Recession. As for Kissinger, his role has always been to be a poster boy for supposedly brilliant ideas. But in the same way the first Bretton Woods agreement spawned the bloodsucking IMF, a new system designed by these people would certainly finish off emerging economies. This aspect of the NWO is a topic for another report; I mention the IMF here only because it is fundamental to understanding how the current situation is a calamity. A final point here should be about accountability, for clearly the financial miseries of the world are not owing to the average citizen’s fiscal expertise. Using the IMF’s own narrative to frame those responsible, I quote from FINANCE & DEVELOPMENT, September 2017, Vol. 54, No. 3 with regard to the 1973 oil crisis and Kissinger’s role then:

So, the “volatility” that Kissinger and the other NWO operatives put in place made trillions for the elites and ended up breaking the rest of us in the long term. This is a drastic oversimplification, of course, but my point is well made. Now let’s turn to the current day technocrats for a look at how the elites are running the game today.

This Forbes story clues us to the way the world has always worked. If you think capitalism and democracy are any different from a feudal system after reading this, it’s time for world history refresher courses. Bill Gates, a modern lord put in place by the real power brokers, operates with impunity using the most Machiavellian tactics imaginable. Gates and other American oligarchs not only milk the rest of us dry, but they are also applauded for doing so. Talk about adding insult to injury: it’s not enough that we fund their success, the new nobles demand to be cheered as well. Read for yourself how Gates’ massive wealth is sheltered from taxes under the umbrella of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. To illustrate on Gates, I’ll quote directly from a Guardian piece on the subject of his hypocrisy:

From this quote the spotlight shifts from Bill Gates to the other “made men” the global order has created in the digital age.is now the world’s richest man, a nobody magically transformed by creating yet another mail order catalog.and his college chums dance to the tune of the NSA and the CIA according to many accounts. And thecame out of nowhere to rule the Internet like machines from the movie The Matrix. The fans in techy land worship these people like geniuses when in reality they’re ordinary minions willing to do anything for the mission.

As of five years ago, half of the wealth in the world belonged to the top 1%. Furthermore, the top 10% hold 85% of the total world wealth. But these figures do not tell the whole story. A Credit Suisse Report, “Wealth Distribution & Gini (2013)” tells us the damnable reality of disproportionate value our world is faltering under. While some would argue that the United States of America’s citizens being thirty times wealthier on average than Russian citizens is some kind of golden badge of excellence, others would argue about who is benefitting from whom. Countries like Denmark, with virtually no natural resources, have a citizenry 25 times richer than Russians, 12 times richer than South Africans, 35 times wealthier than Venezuelans, and nearly twice as prosperous as people from oil-rich Qatar. Don’t take my word for it, parous the unbelievable statistics yourself. In the last forty years, since Kissinger and the others reshaped our economic system, the top 1% went from controlling 19.9% of the world’s wealth to owning 41% of everything. And now the system referred to unabashedly by the elites as the U.S. backed liberal world order wants to reorganize for us once again. Now we see how truly insane Thomas Hobbes was to kowtow toward government and morality by proxy. For further reading on these matters I suggest “Who Rules America?” by Professor G. William Domhoff, and this report via the Economist from 2012.

Reading further into plans laid out by legendary mining magnate and politician Cecil Rhodes (pictured) may serve well to frame this “liberal world order” that is no longer afraid of being out in the open.

But there are endless theories that coincide with what we see going on today. Once such theory brought to light by Larry McDonald, the second president of the John Birch Society, most resembles what I believe will be the outcome of today’s chaos. That is, if the elites in the west have their way. According to McDonald, the Rockefellers and their minions wanted to create and control a one-world government that combined “super-capitalism” with communism. This crazy combination of ideals seems the most likely construct of power crazy elitists for me. But then, who can say? All we know for certain is that Bill Gates or Bill and Hillary Clinton philanthropy are only tax evasive-profit driven charades serving two purposes. The first is to protect untold riches from taxes. The second is to while insinuating their strategies in the emerging world. I will not get into Gates’ vaccines, etc. What is important to understand is that these people care nothing whatsoever for our wellbeing; they thrive at our expense only. This is understood since the dawn of time. The legacy Americans were supposed to inherit, the promise America made to the world – it’s a lie, gone, and probably never was. If we set out to save the world after World War II, then we did a piss-poor job of it, for almost nobody is better off for our wars and economic miracles today. Well, except for Gates, Bezos, George Soros, the remaining Rockefellers, and those Rothschilds over in Europe.

Finally, as I read from Wikipedia about the “alleged conspirators” involved in this “deadly world order,” I am even more assured of my correctness in writing this report. Allow me this quote, please.

I know Wikipedia is not the best source of absolute truth, but in this case, I can only wonder at how the editors seem to have left nothing out. Isn’t this precisely the situation we find ourselves in today? I can only wonder at what percent these elites will leave us the next go-around.

497,"At the time of writing, Sepp Blatter is not in jail. Nor is he in an igloo or a space shuttle. No, His Holiness is exactly where he should be, still proudly astride his golden throne in Switzerland, contemplating ways to use another term as the hallowed father of Fifa to deliver even more joy and peace to the global footballing family. Amen.

Uefa has decided not to boycott Friday’s presidential elections in the wake of the FBI collaring a – what’s the right collective term here? - brown envelope of Fifa executives; and Britain’s Tory government, renowned for its intolerance of white collar chicanery, has called for Blatter to be replaced to help deodorise a sport that should be known for nothing other than the excellence of players from teams such as Aston Ham and West Harlequins and, oh, you know, all those others sides with great batsmen.

But there are still people brave enough to stand up for the doctrine of Blatter Infallbility. “This is yet another blatant attempt [by the United States] to extend its jurisdiction to other states,” stormed Vladimir Putin, who seemingly ranks suggestions of wrongdoing by Fifa alongside other fictional notions such as Big Foot, unicorns and Ukrainian sovereignty. “It’s a clear attempt not to allow Mr Blatter to be re-elected as president of Fifa, which is a great violation of the operating principles of international organisations,” added Putin, without specifying whether due process should instead involve tanks and surface-to-air missiles.

So that you no longer have to wonder what the head of the Guinea Bissau Football Association makes of all this, Manuel Nascimento Lopes piped up today to reassert his deep faith in Blatter and denounce the diabolical campaign against him. “I’m a Christian and this is blasphemy,” Nascimento Lopes blurted to Insideworldfootball.com, seemingly deifying the Swiss before hastily pointing out that this god is not omniscient: “People say Blatter must have known about this but do I know other people’s secrets?”

“I DO think there’s a ‘squatch in these woods….”

What the heck has happened to science on television? Animal Planet has a show called “Finding Bigfoot,” with a guy looking like he just cleaned out all the pork rinds at the Piggly Wiggly telling us he believes “there’s a “squatch” in these woods….”

“Sasquatches DO exist,” insists another sasquatch hunter, doing his best to look and sound serious, in the show’s accidentally comical commercial.

We shouldn’t single out Animal Planet for scorn, however. The channel does have silly company. The History Channel has a show called UFO Hunters. Planet Green has a show called UFOs over Earth. These and other channels show Nostradamus programs more regularly than they show microscopes and telescopes combined.

Against this backdrop, I suppose we shouldn’t be surprised by incessantly ridiculous claims and headlines about global warming.

Global warming causes earthquakes. Global warming causes depression. Global warming causes tsunamis. Global warming causes wife beatings. Global warming causes acne. Global warming causes AIDS. Global warming causes a greater likelihood of a UFO invasion.

No, seriously, scientist-activists and their media allies have alleged each of the above, and then some.

Just as microscopes and telescopes are glaringly missing on the “science” and “history” shows about sasquatches and UFOs, so too is the Scientific Method glaringly missing from alarming global warming claims.

“Global warming is a crisis because our computer models predict it will be.”

But your computer models predicted more warming for the present than has actually occurred.”

“Um, well, we have fixed that. Really.”

Don’t your billions of dollars of annual government funding dry up if global warming turns out not to be a crisis?

“Maybe, but we are guided by altruism and science.”

Can we take a look at the original data you used and can we examine your procedures?

“Why should I show them to you when you will simply try to find something wrong with them?”

Because that is how science works. Can we see them please?

“No, that would violate my privacy rights and my academic freedom.”

Then why should we believe a global warming crisis truly exists?

I guess if such ridiculous circular logic passes for New Age science and if such ridiculous alleged harms as acne, wife beatings and UFO invasions are presented as legitimate global warming crises, then why should we NOT have Bigfoot, UFOs and Nostradamus appearing front and center on science and history programs.

Did you hear about the most recent one? Global warming is causing mutant sharks.

Two different shark subspecies appear to be breeding together in the waters off the coast of Australia. The Australian blacktip shark and the common blacktip shark seem to have been listening to Barry White music and getting their groove on together. Kind of like wolves breeding with husky dogs or German shepherds breeding with golden retrievers.

No big deal, really, except that some clever rainmaker for government grants has found a way to assert a connection with global warming. “The Australian blacktip is smaller and tends to live in warmer waters near northern and eastern Australia. Its globally distributed counterpart, the common blacktip, is larger and favors cooler waters,” explains the Jan. 3 Christian Science Monitor.

Did you get that? The Australian blacktip shark lives in warm waters. The common blacktip shark lives globally, in both warm and cool waters, but allegedly “favors cooler waters.” Therefore, if a few Australian blacktips and a few common blacktips get together and do the wild thing, global warming must be the reason. Now somebody please start shoveling some government grants our way.

By the way, what type of scientific evidence supports the asserted global warming connection?

Please allow me to quote the Huffington Post: “Lead researcher Jess Morgan said, ‘If [the Australian blacktip] hybridizes with the common species it can effectively shift its range further south into cooler waters, so the effect of this hybridizing is a range expansion.’”

OK, let’s get this straight. The immensely intelligent and forward-thinking Australian blacktip shark knows that humans are burning fossil fuels and have just failed to renew the Kyoto Protocol. This would seem to be good news for the warm water-loving Australian blacktip. Nevertheless, the Australian blacktip realizes that too much of its favored warm water might at some point in the future become a bad thing. Therefore, the Australian blacktips all got together and came up with a scheme to seduce unsuspecting common blacktip sharks so that they can find a way to survive in COOLER waters. All of this, of course, is to adjust to anticipated future decades of human-caused global warming.

Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant! Whoever said sharks were stupid?!

908,"You can probably picture a Yeti, even if you've never visited the Himalayas. From Scooby Doo to Doctor Who, Tintin and Monsters, Inc., the ""Abominable Snowman"" has popped up regularly in films, video games and television for decades.

In popular culture, a Yeti is an enormous, shaggy ape-man with huge feet and aggressive sabre-like teeth. Its fur is either grey or white. It is often depicted roaming the snowy mountains alone, a feral throwback to our violent evolutionary past.

Is there anything to this mythical figure, beyond tall tales and vivid imaginations? In the last few years, modern genetics has been brought to bear on the Himalayan Yeti. As a result, we may finally be able to put the mystery to bed.

The Yeti is one of several supposed ""ape-men"". Elsewhere in the world, people tell tales of Bigfoot or the Sasquatch, which are beyond the scope of this article.

The Yeti figure has its origins in folklore. The character is an ancient and important part of the legends and history of the Sherpa, the communities that live at an average altitude of 12,000 feet in eastern Nepal.

Shiva Dhakal collected 12 traditional stories in his book Folk Tales of Sherpa and Yeti. In the stories, the animal is always a figure of danger.

For example, ""The Annihilation of the Yeti"" is about Sherpas seeking revenge on a tormenting group of Yetis. They make a show of drinking alcohol and fighting to encourage the Yetis to follow suit and destroy each other. Instead, the surviving Yetis declare revenge and move up high into the mountains to continue their depredations.

In another story, a local girl is raped by a Yeti and loses her health soon after. In a third, the Yeti grows taller and bigger as the sun rises and the human that sees him loses consciousness and energy.

These tales fulfil one of the key purposes of folklore: to provide motivational or morality lessons. Specifically, they warn the Sherpa community about approaching dangerous wild animals.

""Perhaps, folktales of Yeti were used as a warning or, likely, for morality, so that kids wouldn't wander far away and they would be always close and safe within their community,"" says Dhakal.

""Some say that Yeti is just a fear that has been built inside the head of mountainous people to make them stronger and more fearless in the harsh weather.""

But when Western mountaineers started travelling to the Himalayas, the myth evolved into something even more monstrous and sensational.

In 1921 the explorer and politician Charles Howard-Bury led a British expedition to Mount Everest. He spotted some large footprints and was told that they belonged to ""metoh-kangmi"". This means something like ""man-bear snow-man"".

When the expedition returned, a journalist interviewed some of the members. Unfortunately, Henry Newman was not the most accurate reporter. He first mistranslated ""metoh"" as ""filthy"", then decided that ""abominable"" was even better.

In that moment, a legend was born. Accounts of sightings by locals continued to be translated by Western visitors and the story of a mysterious ape-like snow-man took off.

By the 1950s, interest ran high. Various mountaineers launched expeditions to find the creature.

Even the Hollywood film star James Stewart supposedly got in on the act, by storing a Yeti finger in his luggage. In 2011, DNA testing revealed that the finger was human.

Ever since, there have been footprints in snow, DIY-style films, grainy photographs and eyewitness accounts from mountaineers. Putative Yeti skulls have been found, as well as bone fragments and hair samples. But on inspection, they've usually been attributed to other wildlife, such as bears, antelopes and monkeys.

Despite any concrete proof, people still go looking for Yetis in the Himalayas. Yetis are an example of cryptozoology: the search for creatures that cannot be said to exist because of a lack of evidence.

The mountaineer Reinhold Messner is perhaps the most famous Yeti-hunter of all. He claims to have seen one in the Himalayas in the 1980s, and returned dozens of times to get to the bottom of the mystery.

Messner has a simple theory to explain all the sightings: the Yeti is a bear.

Messner argues that the Yeti legend is a combination of a real bear species and Sherpa tales about the dangers of wild animals.

""All the Yeti footprints are all the same bear,"" says Messner. ""The Yeti isn't a fantastic figure. The Yeti is reality.""

He is contemptuous of the idea that the Yeti is some sort of ape-man, as promoted by Howard-Bury and Newman.

""People don't like reality, they like crazy stories,"" he says. ""They like the Yeti as a Neanderthal, the Yeti as a mix between a human and an ape.""

In 2014, Messner's point of view received some unlikely support: from genetics.

Bryan Sykes, formerly a professor of genetics at the University of Oxford in the UK, decided to test some supposed Yetis.

He and his team analysed hair samples from anomalous primates said to be Yetis, some of them supplied by Messner. They then compared the ""Yeti"" DNA with the genomes of other animals.

The team found that two Himalayan samples – one from Ladakh, India and the other from Bhutan – were most genetically similar to a polar bear that lived 40,000 years ago.

This suggested that the Himalayas is home to an as-yet-unknown bear, a hybrid of an ancient polar bear and a brown bear. ""If these bears are widely distributed in the Himalayas, they may well contribute to the biological foundation of the Yeti legend,"" the team wrote.

However, this claim quickly ran into trouble.

""Polar bears in the Himalayas sounded like a really cool thing,"" says Ross Barnett of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. Working with Ceiridwen Edwards, then at the University of Oxford, he decided to double-check.

Sykes and his colleagues had put all their DNA data onto a public database called GenBank. ""It was really easy to download it,"" says Barnett.

They found a big mistake. ""There wasn't an exact match to the Pleistocene polar bears like they said,"" says Barnett. ""The match was to modern polar bears, and the actual matches were really slight.""

This suggested a less exciting interpretation. Instead of a secret population of polar bears living in the Himalayas, Barnett and Edwards concluded that the DNA from the hairs had been damaged.

This does happen. Hair is a good source of ancient DNA, because the keratin keeps harmful water away from the DNA, but it can degrade.

""I think I was disappointed,"" says Barnett. ""These out-of-the-blue discoveries are the things that everyone likes to hear about. The fact we were shooting that down was slightly sad, but at the end of the day it's important to get to the bottom of these sorts of things.""

The study has since been replicated again, by Eliécer Gutiérrez of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. and Ronald Pine of the University of Kansas in Lawrence. After comparing the DNA sequences, they found ""no reason to believe"" that the two ""Yeti"" samples came from anything other than brown bears.

Sykes and his team released a statement acknowledging their error. However they also pointed out that ""the conclusion that these Himalayan 'Yeti' samples were certainly not from a hitherto unknown primate is unaffected."" In other words, the samples don't look anything like an ape-man.

Still, the idea of ape-like creatures living in the mountains is more believable now than it was a few decades ago. We now know that hominid populations can go unnoticed for a long time.

Take the Denisovans, an extinct species of human known from a few fragmentary remains from a cave in Siberia. The remains were only discovered in 2008, yet genetic analysis suggests they survived for hundreds of thousands of years, only dying out around 40,000 years ago.

Another lost species endured until even more recently. The diminutive ""hobbits"" Homo floresiensis may have survived in Indonesia until just 12,000 years ago. That suggests there might be other populations to learn about.

Writing in the journal Nature in 2004, in the wake of the hobbit discovery, Henry Gee wrote that: ""The discovery that Homo floresiensis survived until so very recently, in geological terms, makes it more likely that stories of other mythical, human-like creatures such as Yetis are founded on grains of truth.""

There is clearly logic to that. But the trouble is, there is still no hard evidence, and if a population of unknown ape-men did exist, there are certain things we ought to see.

If you can get into their habitat, primates and other big animals are hard to miss, even if they're uncommon. ""When you look at primate species that are really rare, like bonobos and orang-utans, the evidence is all around and easy to spot,"" says Barnett.

""There are places in the Himalayas where a population of large apes could theoretically survive,"" says Vladimir Dinets of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who has worked in the Himalayas.

""But all these places have lots of people living off the land, so all local species of mammals larger than a rat are regularly hunted by various means,"" he says.

The animals would need to roam widely to find enough food, which means they would struggle to stay hidden.

The climate is also an issue. Primates would struggle in the harsh Himalayan weather.

""Even if they were as hardy as Japanese macaques, the most cold-tolerant primates known, they would have to descend into subtropical forests in winter,"" says Dinets.

Again, that would surely mean discovery. ""These forests exist as small patches,"" says Dinets. ""Most of them have been cleared for agriculture a long time ago.""

Yet the Yetis stubbornly refuse to show up.

In 2011, a Russian-led expedition and conference claimed to have ""irrefutable evidence"" of the Yeti's existence, including a bed.

However, Russian-born Dinets says it was a publicity stunt with no substantial evidence whatsoever found. Instead, it's part of a long tradition of hoodwinking outsiders.

""For about twenty years, summer trips to the mountains to look for Yetis were a popular pastime among city intelligentsia,"" says Dinets.

""The only result was that every village in the mountains of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan got a designated 'Yeti witness', whose job was to tell visitors tall tales, guide them to remote valleys where sightings were supposedly taking place, and charge them a lot of money for the service.""

In summary, there is no hard evidence of the existence of an unknown primate in the Himalayas, and plenty of reason to suspect that it can't possibly exist.

It also seems that the evidence for polar bears in the Himalayas doesn't hold up. Bears might well be involved in the legend, but they are probably brown bears, which are common in Asia anyway.

Barnett believes the most likely explanation of the Yeti legend is misinterpretations of animals like brown bears, combined with the human tendency to tell tall tales about unknown animals.

That probably won't mean the end of the search, though. ""The fact there has never been any evidence hasn't stopped people from searching,"" says Barnett. As long as we enjoy legends and fairy tales, we won't forget the Yeti.",mainstream
84,"Over Half of Every Tax Dollar You Give to Uncle Sam is Spent on This

Most people probably don’t think too much about this, but are you aware of just how much of your income is being used to fuel the military industrial complex?

Conveniently omitted from the corporate/state-run media organizations is the fact that some 53 percent of your tax dollars are spent on the military. That’s right, more than half of the money you give to Uncle Sam for the privilege of being American income is spent directly on military.

In 2011 the budget for the US Government was over 3 trillion dollars, while military spending included a $717 billion request from the pentagon, $200 billion towards “overseas contingency funding” for the two major conflicts we are engaged in, and $40 billion in black budget intelligence which includes the CIA, NSA, and other agencies where the amount of money given is never fully disclosed.

In addition, $94 billion was spent on non-DOD military operations, $100 billion on health care and veterans benefits, and $400 billion was spent paying off the interest on debt raised to pay for past wars. This all adds up to over 1.6 trillion dollars spent on so-called defense. That is more than what was spent during the second world war after being adjusted for inflation.

Now it is true that defense spending is important to American interests. You might be inclined to think about how much worse off we would be without a military. Without a strong defense, if a country decided to engage us in any sort of negative way militarily we wouldn’t be able to resist or hold our ground.

However, what is typically called “defense spending” is by-and-large nothing offense spending designed to support a policy of military interventionism which exploits many nations for their natural resources and establishes Rothschild controlled central banks wherever and whenever they can.

To see this, one needs not look beyond the excuses for going to war in the first place. From the Gulf of Tonkin incident of August 1964, to the supposed WMD’s in Iraq, to Obama’s attempt in the summer of 2013 to begin bombing campaigns in Syria, nearly each and every war is initiated alongside war propaganda intended to serve the special interests who profit from the lucrative military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about in his farewell address of 1961.

Why would they need to continuously lie to get us into war if there was a plausible reason for “defending ourselves” in the first place?

Drone Bombings Are America’s Slap In The Face To The World

When you take the immediate danger of American soldiers out of the equation, and in some cases any human input at all, it creates a situation where the public generally doesn’t see any problem with bombing the living daylights out of another country because it is out of sight, out of mind. For this reason, the drone program has become one of the military’s most insidious operations in history.

To put the drone program into perspective you have to understand its scale and its ability to remain covert. During the Obama presidency alone, the US has bombed a total of eight countries. Syria, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, Uganda, and Pakistan. Also, Obama became the worlds first Nobel Peace Prize winner to bomb another Nobel Peace Prize winner when he authorized a strike on a Afghan hospital run by the 1999 Peace Prize recipient Doctors Without Borders, killing at least 22 people. And somehow, bombs somehow keep on falling in places where Obama boasts that he hast ended two wars.

A recent whistle blower exposed the fact that about 90 percent of those killed in drone strikes are not the intended targets. Yes, you heard that right. For every ten people killed by American drones, nine are innocent bystanders, some of which are merely patients in a hospital suspected of harboring terrorists.

This Money Could Be Spent Fixing Our Country, Or Better Yet Not Stolen From Us

In 2014 one fighter jet ended up costing the US $400 billion dollars. That amount of money could have payed for every homeless person in America to have a house worth $600,000. Imagine what that kind of money could have done if it were spent on humanitarian efforts, or better yet, if left in the hands of hardworking Americans who are supporting the economy through their free market decisions.

At the end of the day, we are all cash-cows for Uncle Sam and his globalist military industrial complex.

This short video puts it all nicely into perspective:

1306,"You might not think about your feet, but your feet are thinking about you. Not only do they get you where you need to go, they can actually help cure you of some everyday aches and pains.

Reflexology is an ancient healing practice based on the belief that the foot has multiple reflex points that correspond to different organs and glands in the body.

Pressure is applied to these specific points with specific thumb, finger, or hand techniques. While these movements do feel great on your feet, they also promote good health.

There are certain nerve zones on the foot that deal with headaches. Gently massage your big toe in circular motions to relax your neck. With increasing pressure, focus on the top halves of your toes to pinpoint nerves connected to the head.

By targeting the pituitary gland, you can rid yourself of sleep disorders. Using your thumb, press in and around the planter pad of your big toe (the middle of it). Do this for 1 minute on each toe. You can massage the bottom of your feet with warm coconut oil to help relieve stress and promote better sleep.

One particular technique for relieving stress is call the wrist twist. Make a circle with your thumb and index finger around your thumb (they don’t have to touch). Twist the opposing hand about 20 times and repeat with the other wrist.

To help fight cold and flu, you’ll have to target the nerves that deal with the sinuses, nose, throat, and lungs. On your feet, apply pressure and rub the sides of your big toe, the middle of each toe, and an inch below each toe. You can also apply the same technique to your hands; massage the tips of your finger just above the knuckle.

To help promote proper digestion you can use this simple technique. Using either a tennis or a golf ball, lock your fingers around it and massage the bottom of your palms for 60 seconds. You can also apply this technique to the lower third of your foot on the bottom side.

Back pain is one of the most common ailments suffered by people of all ages. To relieve lower back pain, use your thumb to apply pressure in between the outer ankle bone and your Achilles tendon.

For upper back pain, use your thumbs to massage the arch of your foot, the sides of your feet, and the soles as well.

From helping you relax to relieving you of lower back pain, your feet have the keys to help common ailments people suffer every day. Take care of your feet and they’ll take care of you.",conspiracy
1142,"Big cats or wolves seem like scaled-up versions of the tabby or terrier sleeping on your sofa. But the proportions do subtly change as animals get larger. For one thing, big animals’ feet are smaller relative to their bodies than are smaller beasts’. But they compensate with physics, according to new research in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. [see: http://bit.ly/cDdbUx]

 

 When we think about animal locomotion…whether it’s walking, running, or just standing around…we usually focus on the bones and muscles in the legs and feet. But for four-legged critters, it’s the footpads that ultimately support the animal’s weight. So scientists [Kai-Jung Chi, National Chung-Hsing University, Republic of China (Taiwan) and V. Louise Roth, Duke University] decided to take a closer look at these “natural shoes” in different-sized carnivores, including dogs, cats, wolves, leopards and hyenas.

And they found that the relatively smaller footpads of, say, leopards are much stiffer than those of little bitty kitties. Apparently so that the big cats’ feet can handle the stress of the greater body weight. If a tiger’s paws were as soft as a house cat’s, he’d need hippo-sized feet to stand. 

 

 It’s said that the bigger they are, the harder they fall. But now we know that the bigger they are, the harder their feet.

941,"After savagely beating his wife for hours as she pleaded for mercy, Conway Stevenson left her bloodied, naked and alone to die while several people who witnessed the attack did nothing.

Stevenson had already served multiple stints in jail for bashing Teresita Bigfoot, the Northern Territory supreme court was told on Monday, including having struck her with a wooden plank and a metal pipe and stomped on her.

“This time you killed her,” justice Jenny Blokland said as she sentenced him to 14 years’ jail for reckless manslaughter.

On the night of the November 2013 attack, Stevenson was angry because Bigfoot would not stop drinking with her cousin to go home with him.

He told his grandmother he was going to kill her, and he beat her for hours.

He repeatedly punched and hit her in the face with a stick, punched and stomped on her stomach, jumped on her head and slammed it on to the bitumen.

“I love you,” she repeatedly told him as he attacked her.

An autopsy found she had a broken jaw, two broken ribs, a ruptured bowel and internal bleeding.

“You did not stop when she begged you to, you just kept on bashing her,” Blokland said.

“After you bashed Teresita, you did not help her. You left her lying naked to die in the dark alone.”

Several people witnessed the attack and saw Stevenson with blood on his hands and clothes but no one did anything to help.

“No one helped her, no one tried to stop him and no one called the police,” Blokland said.

“What are we? What have we become if we do not try to help each other when terrible things like this are happening?”

Bigfoot was a caring and loving woman, the court heard, who helped her family whenever anyone had problems and looked after their children. The family felt terrible grief and anger at her loss.

Stevenson was sentenced to a non-parole period of eight years. Taking into account almost two years already served, he could be eligible for parole in November 2023.",mainstream
707,"The Legend of Bigfoot is a 1976 American pseudo-documentary film directed by Harry Winer.

Animal tracker Ivan Marx opens by mentioning the film is the culmination of 10 years of research. He says that the Eskimos called the creature ""bushman,"" the Colville Indians ""Sasquatch,"" and the Hoopa ""Om-mah,"" but is most commonly known as Bigfoot.

Marx's brother-in-law takes him to the land of petrified wood, showing him rock carvings of creatures with big hands and feet. The carvings tell the story of the creature stealing children, causing a village to be abandoned.

Marx finds large tracks in the snow and later a dead bear with similar tracks nearby. He finds strange hair between the bear's teeth and sets out to track the creature. He finds tracks in the mud beside a river and something moving nearby. He intends to inform others but rain washes the tracks away.

Marx investigates tracks in several states only to find they're not bigfoot tracks. He visits the Oh-mah bigfoot redwood statue in northern California and the Oregon coast, continuing to search.

Marx takes a job in Washington state to film a Cinnamon bear. While there, he films Bigfoot walking through a field. He mentions that his footage of Bigfoot has been questioned by science and used by others on lecture circuits to make money.

Marx shows footage of an injured squirrel, goats eating dirt, and glaciers melting. He mentions the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and visits Yukon Frida, who paints pictures of Bigfoot.

Marx travels above the Arctic circle, showing footage of the Northern lights while relating Bigfoot tales. He visits an Eskimo who promises he'll see Bigfoot. Later in the evening, he films what he describes ""the shining eyes"" of the creature, but when dawn comes, he says Bigfoot disappeared behind a rainbow.

Marx shows footage of salmon spawning, geese migrating, caribou, and Alaska moose defending their territory. He searches from a plane and films a young Bigfoot near a river. He lands, but Bigfoot runs away.

He films hunters with their kills and beavers gathering wood for their dams. He then shows footage of Bigfoot at another river and a second Bigfoot close by, mentioning a related strong musky odor. Bigfoot is shown eating grass and Marx mentions he must be a vegetarian.

Marx ends the film by saying he has determined Bigfoot's migratory and eating habits and that he'll continue his search to document more of Bigfoot's behaviors.

It has been claimed that Ivan Marx was the first to find handprints of Bigfoot.[2] Much of the film is wildlife and nature footage.

The film was created by Ivan Marx,[3] the majority of which he filmed himself.[4] Marx did the narration for the film himself[2] and also served as the executive producer.[5]

The Legend of Bigfoot was released to theaters in 1976.[1]

The Legend of Bigfoot was released to the home video market on VHS tape by World Premiere Home Video in 1985.[6] In 2009, the film was released on DVD, along with Snowbeast, by Alpha Video.[7]

Like Marx himself, his film polarized critics, audiences and Bigfoot hunters alike.[citation needed] Praise focused largely on the nature footage and the new information about cryptozoology, but criticism largely focused on Marx's rambling voice-overs (seen by some as self-promotion) and the poor-quality Bigfoot footage, that most have accepted as a hoax.[citation needed] However, to this day, there are many supporters of Marx,[who?] who consider him a true explorer and pioneer in the field of cryptozoology.

Don Peake composed the music for the film.[8]

Introduction

 Hello. This is Dr. James Ioli speaking. I am chief of podiatry at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and served as the guest editor of a special section on the feet and foot problems in the August 2009 Harvard Health Letter.

Leonardo Da Vinci said the human foot is a work of art and a masterpiece of engineering. It's one of my favorite quotes. Even so, things go wrong with our feet. Normal wear-and-tear is partly to blame. But the shoes we wear, the way we walk -- they pus extra strain on certain parts of the foot. And that extra strain can inflame tissues and move bones out of alignment.

Here are four common foot conditions, their causes, and what you can do about them.

Bunion

 Normally, the thin metatarsal and phalanx bones that form the long part of the foot and the five toes are lined up, gracefully, in more or less a straight line.

A bunion occurs when the joint between the big toe's metatarsal bone and the proximal phalange falls out of alignment and angles out. Bunion comes from the French word for turnip. Often the end of the metatarsal bone enlarges and becomes misshapen. People get bunions because of poor arches and pronation -- a tendency to walk on the inside part of the foot. Wearing narrow shoes can also cause bunions by putting backward pressure on the big toe so it buckles out.

Metatarsalgia

 The metatarsalgia occurs when you stand or walk on the balls of your feet. As a result, the ends of the metatarsal bones get tender and sore. Some people walk up on the balls of their feet because of a naturally short Achilles tendon. But high heels are common cause of metatarsalgia. They position the feet so there is extra pressure on the front of the foot. And the higher the heel, the greater the pressure.

Plantar fasciitis

 The plantar fascia is a band of tissue that attaches to the heelbone on one end to the toes on the other. It helps form the arch of the foot and with pushing off as you walk.

Plantar fasciitis is inflammation of the plantar fascia. The pain is often felt just near the underside heel but it can also come from the entire underside of the foot. Standing or walking for long periods can cause plantar fasciitis. Overpronation -- walking so you put weight along the inside the foot -- is another cause.

Posterior tibial tendon dysfunction

 The posterior tibial tendon starts in the calf, wraps around the inside bump of your ankle and then along the inside of the arch of your foot. It is one of several structures that help your legs, ankles, and feet work together.

If this tendon is dysfunctional -- a catchall term for being weak, thick or inflamed -- you can have pain, difficulty getting up on your toes, and trouble walking normally. Being heavy can cause all kinds of foot problems -- including posterior tibial tendon dysfunction.",mainstream
408,"A team of researchers led by Melba Ketchum, a Texas veterinarian, claims to have not only conclusively proven the existence of Bigfoot through genetic testing, but also that the mysterious monster is a half-human hybrid, the result of mating with modern human females about 15,000 years ago.

Ketchum’s work — which had been delayed for years because no peer-reviewed scientific journal would accept her study — was finally published yesterday in something called the “DeNovo Scientific Journal.”

There’s been much discussion about the dubious validity of the study; the fact that it was rejected by mainstream science journals and instead self-published in a “science journal” and web site created specifically for that purpose raised many eyebrows.

As i09 writer Robert T. Gonzales drily noted, “The site claims to be ‘open access,’ but charges 30 bucks to access the Bigfoot genome paper. It bears mentioning that the Bigfoot genome paper, at the time of this posting, is also the only paper in Vol. 1, Issue 1 of the new journal. Seeing as ‘open access’ clearly does not mean what these researchers think it means, you’ll forgive us if we remain skeptical when they say their data ‘conclusively proves that the Sasquatch exist as an extant hominin.’”

So what’s this all about? Why, exactly, is Ketchum struggling so mightily to prove that Bigfoot exist? Though Ketchum is charging for copies of her article, her motivation is likely not profit, since she’s not going to get rich from her research. Nor is it fame, since the paper is garnering universally scathing reviews from scientists, which can only further tarnish her reputation.

Instead, the answer may surprise you: Ketchum sees her research as an important first step in obtaining legal status for Bigfoot, which she believes are an undiscovered Native American population. Ketchum issued a statement demanding that the U.S. “Government at all levels must recognize them as an indigenous people and immediately protect their human and Constitutional rights against those who would see in their physical and cultural differences a ‘license’ to hunt, trap, or kill them.”

Why Do So Many Cultures Have a Version of Bigfoot?

This is not the first time that believers in unknown animals have petitioned the government for their protection. Similar quasi-legal measures have been proposed or passed; for example in 2007 a Canadian Bigfoot enthusiast named Todd Standing (who, like Ketchum, claims to have definitive proof of Bigfoot) petitioned the government to make harming the creatures a crime. “Champ,” the lake monster reputed to dwell in Lake Champlain is “officially” protected by both the New York State Assembly and the Vermont Legislature.

Ketchum apparently views herself as less of a Bigfoot researcher than a valiant protector of a peaceful, vulnerable, and undiscovered native people.

Ketchum believes that “The Sasquatch people are more like us than they are different. The Sasquatch people have their own language, traditions, and rituals. They live in family units, they order their lives according to the laws of their people, and they bury their dead. Yet the Sasquatch people are captivating because of their physical, genetic, and cultural differences. Sadly, these special traits also make them uniquely vulnerable to those who would see in their unusual lifestyle or appearance a justification to harass, trap, or even kill them. Your compassion and understanding will be vital to protect the Sasquatch people.”

Given that—as far as we know — no Bigfoot have ever been harassed, trapped or killed, the idea that federal laws are required to prevent such actions seems rather like putting the cart before the unicorn.

Ketchum’s complaint — echoed by many on the Bigfoot and paranormal fields — that closed-minded scientists refuse to look at her evidence because they are afraid of its implications is absurd. If and when hard evidence is offered for Bigfoot, scientists will be scrambling to investigate and research this amazing scientific breakthrough.

The irony is that all the blurry photos, eyewitness reports, ambiguous footprints, and pseudoscientific DNA testing in the world have failed, whereas it would only take one Bigfoot, trapped live or found dead, to conclusively prove that the creatures exist.",mainstream
1184,"Bigfoot might just have the best travel agent of all time.

Just a couple of months after purportedly being spotted in the Canadian wilderness, the legendary Sasquatch has been spotted in New Jersey, according to the Asbury Park Press, which first reported the news.

The sighting, listed in the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization database, was in the Pine Barrens part of New Jersey on April 7 when a husband and wife, who were walking their dog, claim they spotted the creature.

""After a bit we started to drive off,"" Tricia, the wife who observed Bigfoot said, according to the report. ""I am driving and in a split second I saw something brown on 2 legs and about 6 feet tall sprint behind the car in the area we were just in. I caught it in my rear view mirror. I was kind of thinking to myself that my eyes were playing tricks on me but I just couldn't shake it.""

VIDEO: IS IT... BIGFOOT? HARD-TO-MAKE-OUT FOOTAGE PURPORTING TO SHOW LEGENDARY GIANT IN CANADA FOREST GOES VIRAL

It's unclear exactly what Tricia saw in the New Jersey town (maybe it's the infamous Russian gangster from ""The Sopranos"" episode where Christopher and Paulie get lost??), but whatever it was, it was enough for Tricia to get spooked.

Bigfoot and his (or is it a her?) brethren have purportedly been spotted several times over the years in the Garden State, most recently in Cape May County in November 2016. Tim Hanna, along with his friends, were watching TV when they noticed a creature ""just under six feet tall,"" walking away from Hanna's house.

""The creature was about 150 feet away and passed under a street light, which gave us the ability to get a decent look at it,"" Hanna said in the report. ""It was long limbed, but clearly not human. Because of the lighting it was in silhouette, but we could see that it was covered with hair. It was walking with its shoulders hunched forward, and did not appear to be in any distress. We watched it pass from view as it went behind trees and into the woods on the far side of the street.""

It's unclear whether Bigfoot uses Expedia to zip across North America or uses Uber or another ride-sharing service to see the sights of this great continent, but he sure does get around.

In October 2017, Bigfoot was reportedly spotted in Northern California, but only because he had gotten greedy and tried to eat a pig.

Jeffrey Gonzalez, a self-described paranormal expert, said he heard about the sighting from a local farmer who said he saw the creature and five others running on his ranch near Avocado Lake.

“One of them, which was extremely tall, had a pig over its shoulder,"" Gonzalez said in comments obtained by Fox 26, a Fox News affiliate. ""And the five scattered and the one with the pig was running so fast it didn’t see an irrigation pipe and it tripped, with the pig flying over.""

670,"My 2 Cents of Sense: IT IS TIME TO BOARD UP THE BORDER

Jail Mail from James Hovda — Oct 25, 2018 — Thanks to Caithleanne Pont for sharing

Immigration is an issue that resembles the plague… everyone is talking about it, but nobody wants to go near it to fix the damage it creates. Both political parties have steered away from talking about this issue, since blocking immigrants from entering would hurt the Party, or those who back their Party with mega-financing. Democrats see immigration as a weapon to use against Republicans, as the “race card” of bigotry can easily be tossed into play. And, Republicans fold their hand once it has been laid upon the table.

Republicans also see immigration as a weapon to be used to point the finger of shame against Democrats for allowing illegals to do harm to American citizens, yet remain free to hide in the shadows to hurt another. Without uttering a single word of remorse or show a face of sorrow, they all move on as if nothing is happening, and that we citizens need to sit down, mind our own business, and shut the hell up. It is deep anger that now rests upon the faces of most Americans who have watched as little was ever done to discourage illegal border crossings, and with it, all the other related issues, because the people know that… for Democrats, it means votes… and for Republicans, it means cheap labor for their corporate donors.

The old saying of “Don’t bite the hand that feeds you” is very discretely used in Washington politics, more so than ever when it comes to this whole immigration issue. It seems that President Trump is a one man army trying to combat this major problem that stretches America’s security, sanctuary, and sovereignty to the point of snapping into eruption. If politicians really wanted to do something about illegals, the border, and migration, then they have had plenty of time to come up with some very solid, viable solutions. This tells us voters that they don’t give a damn about us, they don’t give a damn about America, and they don’t give a damn about the migrants who are used as a tool to make under-the-table deals, in order to make a lot of money for themselves and their donors by screwing both the migrants and us in the process.

I lived in Arizona for almost a decade back in the 70’s and early 80’s. To most of America back then, this whole immigration issue wasn’t their problem. Illegals have been walking across our open border long before any of us were born, but they were few and far between compared to today. Most came here, picked fruit and vegetables, then took their wages with them as they headed home to their family for 6 months. Everyone was happy, even though everyone knew it was illegal, yet nobody said anything… until 1981, when President Reagan stood before Congress and America to say we had a serious problem that needs to be addressed.

What was a small, yet a contained problem, had rapidly expanded to place a burden upon businesses, schools, hospitals, jails, and communities. During the decade I lived in Arizona, I witnessed the dramatic changes that occurred because of the constant influx of both legal and illegal Hispanics pouring into the state, as Texas, New Mexico, and southern California were also having their demographics dramatically changed. Sections of Phoenix were being taken over by Hispanic “gangs”, as drugs, weapons, and sex trafficking became their main staples. Once quiet streets which you could walk down without fear, soon became part of a district that, if you were a “gringo”, you’d best keep out of… if you knew what was good for you. Country/Western bars soon had trumpets and accordions bellowing the top playlist of Mexico. Low wage jobs once worked by blacks and the non-educated hippies, soon found Lopez, Pedro, and Maria taking their place for a lot less pay. Landscaping, brick laying, roofers, concrete finishers, golf course maintenance, framers… any hand work, small equipment, and housekeeping jobs, quickly saw Hispanics replacing those laborers, because $5/hr was big money for most immigrants, as Hispanics know how to live really cheap.

The streets filled up with “low-riders” that competed at stop lights against one another to see which car could bounce the highest, that gave drivers a fun show, and the cops a headache. The local news began to run stories of increased murder, assaults, rape, and gang violence, showing most offenders to be Hispanic, and most victims to be white. Hospital E-rooms filled beyond capacity, and so did the jails. Local schools had to hire translators, as many children couldn’t speak a word of English. Road signs changed to become bi-lingual, as did documents and public notices. Instead of Arizona forcing Hispanics to adapt to Arizona, the state adapted to the Hispanics. Cinco de Mayo became as celebrated as the Fourth of July.

What really concerned me was that the government was doing little to thwart off the side effects of immigration. I saw it then as I see it now. I stated back in 1983, that if America doesn’t get a handle on the immigration issues, the issues will get a handle upon America. President Reagan tried, but by reluctantly giving amnesty to millions of illegal Hispanics in a trade-off deal with Democrats. Tip O’Neill and Alan Cranston reneged on Reagan’s Immigration and Reform Act by not funding border “protection”, not enforcing employers to “verify” Hispanic’s status, and by not reducing the number of Hispanics allowed in for work visas, and for citizenship. Since then, neither Republicans nor Democrats have stood in defense of that American law.

Not until President Trump has a single president tried to close the border or stop the flow of illegals coming into America. Many have wanted to give amnesty to the ones already here, but that has only encouraged more to come across the border illegally. Since Reagan, cartels have set up shop in America, allowing the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and women. Illegals kill thousands each year in DUI accidents, as assaults, rape, robbery, and murder have gone up 300 percent since the IRA went into effect. Diseases that once were eradicated are now making a comeback.

 Today, we have mayors and even governors seeking sanctuary for any immigrant in order to protect them from any government deportation, regardless of their status… regardless of their crimes. They have basically told Trump and the feds to take a hike. They refuse to abide by the laws of this nation, because they don’t believe in them, nor in this administration.

As you read this, a caravan of over 7,000 “migrants” (and growing by the hundreds each day) from Central and South America is snaking through Mexico in order to crash America’s borders. To the Democrats and the Left, they are “refugees” who are fleeing their homeland of tyranny and oppression. There are no jobs, no food, no medicine, as crime has ravaged the land to remove any freedom or liberty they had. To Trump and us patriots, we see it as an invasion that must be met with force at the border’s edge, if needed. Not a single one should be allowed to enter into our sovereignty. Because of liberal judges and Left-wing courts, all they need to do is step one foot in and request asylum from being persecuted. We have no option but to let them in, and to take care of their every need.

What this will create is a Cloward-Piven effect of overwhelming our systems in order to crash the systems. The Democrats, who hope to regain power this election cycle, plan to revise the whole immigration and border problem by disregarding that there is any problem at all, and to let immigrants come and go as they please without anyone stopping them. Can you see mass chaos and mayhem in the near future if this is allowed?

Although there is speculation and no verification other than someone saying it is true, we are learning that the Democrats and certain globalist money dirt-bags (e.g. Soros) created this caravan, and are financing their journey in order to disrupt the election, create a “no-win” scandal for Trump, and put a tailspin upon the fast improving economy in order to reverse it. We have pretty well verified that many within this caravan are prison releases, gang members, and even Islamic fundamentalists posing as Hispanics. And if this is true, then not a single one can be allowed to set foot into the United States. Everyone must be thoroughly vetted from now on.

President Trump has vowed to place the US military on the border, even though the Dems are already saying they will use it to impeach Trump when they win back Congress, as it falls under “posse comitatus”. The Democrats need to read the law, and read where exactly the Executive Power can reach. The president can call in the Marines if there is an “invasion” from those planning to do harm to the country, and even defend the border by force to prevent entry. Bikers and militias from every state plan to stand with Trump to assist in this oncoming assault. As Andrew Wilkow said on radio today, “This may get very, very ugly!”

It now seems that the Left is putting “we citizens” on the Right into a Catch-22 scenario, where we are damned if we take action… damned if we don’t. The law is most certainly on our side on this one, but the Left no longer respects “our” laws, and defies their existence with total disregard to consequences. Their media, their lawyers, their judges, their universities, and their “MOBS” will revolt and cry out “viva la revolution” if we take any action to stop the illegal’s invasion. As Tucker Carlson states in his best seller, ‘Ship of Fools’: “Our leaders need to be concerned about immigration, but they’re not. Instead they work to make the country even less stable, by encouraging rapid demographic change. With the enthusiastic consent of both political parties, more than 15 million illegal immigrants have been allowed to enter the United States, work jobs, and use public services in a country they are not legally allowed to use, let alone legally live in. Those service are allowed only for legal citizens. It is those who made those modified policies who benefit, in both financial and authoritative power.”

Carlson continues by saying; “If you grew up in America between the 50’s and 2000, suddenly nothing looks the same. The neighborhood is different, the neighbors are different, so is the landscape and the customs and so often the language you hear on the street. You might not recognize your hometown, or even your native state… you might not even recognize the country any longer. Humans are not wired for dramatic changes. They can’t rationalize changes at record pace, because it disorients them. It makes even the most open-minded people jumpy and hostile and suspicious of one another… it encourages tribalism.”

“Those who deny these changes are bigots, and need to be severely dealt with”, declares the Left. The establishment rulers no longer want a nation of European, Christian, and English speaking people, but a nation of ethnic minorities, immense religious pluralism, and no universally shared culture or language. They want diversity across the board, and will do whatever is necessary in order to achieve it.

It is by no accident that thousands picked up their children to walk a thousand miles in desert heat with no supplies only to come to America “for a better life”, all at the same time. They had to be organized, supplied, and encouraged. It is also by no accident that this comes now at a time of an election that will have consequences by which side wins. Once those immigrants reach the border, they won’t go home. And what is there to stop them, in short of being shot swimming across the Rio Grande? Can our border agents stop what we witnessed on the border of Guatemala, as thousands stormed the gates, tore it down, and proceeded to beat the “Federales” who stood in their way to death?

 It is imperative that Congress finds the funds to finish the border wall as President Trump wants. It is also imperative that our law makers understand that we have laws for a reason, and that to be “a nation of laws”, those laws must be enforced.

Until bricks, steel, and concrete can erect a barrier that prevents access, Americans must use whatever means necessary to board up the border to prevent maybe tens of thousands of illegal immigrants from gaining access to our land. The Left can yell and scream all they like about “human rights” and being “un-American,” but if you ask the people, the MAJORITY wants this stopped, the wall built, and the laws supported. And if this new scheme of the Left turns into bloodshed, may it be on their hands, for Americans are only protecting their homeland from invaders who plan to continue the demise of our democracy, and the establishment of a class of rulers who don’t care about any of us, just so long as the ends justifies the means to their full control, and our total demotion into serfdom.

310,"— Germany puts its foot down on the e-Privacy Regulation, asking for more protection for users.

— Digitization and artificial intelligence are among the priorities of the European Parliament's leaders for the next five years.

Good morning and welcome to Morning Tech. It's a public holiday in some EU countries, including Belgium. But we're here to keep you company if you're stuck at work.

LONDON TECH WEEK: Yes, it’s that time of year again when techies from the British capital (and a whole bunch of politicians) break out the party balloons to celebrate London’s top spot on the European scene. Expect government announcements, claims of record investment and a lot of crowing that Brexit won’t hurt the U.K. digital economy. But if you dig a little deeper, there are two warring factions within 'U.K. Tech' fighting over what the country’s pending departure from the European Union really means — and how the government’s policies are affecting how the local industry will grow. For more from Mark, read below or click here.

Case of the optimists: You don’t have to venture far from hipster Shoreditch or well-heeled Mayfair to hear startup founders and venture capitalists tell you that the volatility created by Brexit ‘is a great opportunity.” And so far, the figures show that the U.K. is doing just fine. The country garnered $8.7 billion in venture funding last year, according to Dealroom, the data provider. And wherever you look, local ‘unicorns’ are being created faster than you can pay £5 for an overpriced flat white coffee near Silicon Roundabout.

Case for the pessimists: Just like everything in divided Britain, not everyone agrees with this assessment, claiming that lagging indicators like venture money don’t really tell you what’s going on around the country today. Instead, they point to a gradual fall in new techies showing up to work in the country’s digital ecosystem (and the ongoing development of rival hubs in Berlin and Paris) as a telling (leading) indicator that not all is well in the state of U.K. tech.

What about the politicians? Glad you asked. Amid this techie stand-off, U.K. lawmakers are playing the ‘cake and eat it, too’ strategy of both trying to woo people to the local tech scene, while also pushing ahead with some of the most aggressive digital regulation anywhere in the Western world. Just like a page out of the Brexit playbook, few policymakers are yet willing to make tough decisions about how to handle the future growth of London and the rest of the country’s tech sector. That’s leaving many locals scratching their heads about how the U.K. will continue to grow without proper leadership from those in Westminster.

Talking of London Tech Week, Theresa May, the outgoing U.K. prime minister announced £153 million in government funding this morning focused on supporting next-generation computing technology. She also said that 2,500 places would be made available on artificial intelligence and data conversion courses starting in 2020, and that a panel of local techies would write a study on the country's tech competitiveness amid the uncertainty caused by Brexit.

""If we are going to maintain our position as a global leader, our challenge is how we develop British Tech and make it even better,"" May is expected to say later this morning. ""We want this to be the place everyone thinks of — and comes to — first when they want to develop their world changing tech ideas.""

COMMISSIONERS' WHEREABOUTS: Justice Commissioner Vĕra Jourová is in Prague, where she speaks at a roundtable on Artificial Intelligence. Digital Commissioner Mariya Gabriel is in Sofia, and meets with various Bulgarian ministers.

MARK YOUR CALENDAR: The Court of Justice of the European Union will rule on the Google vs. Germany’s telecoms regulator case June 13. Judges will have to determine whether Gmail is a telecoms service.

GERMANY ASKS FOR MORE PROTECTION IN E-PRIVACY: Morning Tech did not see that one coming. During Friday’s Telecom Council, the German minister said Berlin “can’t support the [e-Privacy] text at the moment because of the wide-ranging powers to process communications data without the consent of the final user.” Pressing for a higher level of privacy protection, he said Germany “rejects Article 6 at the moment, particularly when it comes to localization data and compatible further processing.” Ministers were discussing the Romanian presidency's progress report.

Watch out for Germany’s position paper: The minister said they are preparing a document to feed future discussions.

Ireland and the U.K. on a different page: Ireland also has reservations about Article 6, but for different reasons: Dublin fears it is over-protective and would hinder the fight against child pornography (a POLITICO investigation in March showed Facebook also pushes that argument in lobby meetings with the Irish government). The U.K. also mentioned child sexual abuse, but also insisted on the importance of clarifying the interaction between e-Privacy and GDPR to avoid legal uncertainty. The British minister asked for “future-proof definitions” and said the scope was not entirely clear. “We would not want this measure to take public broadcasting into the definition of direct marketing,” she said.

The Commission’s (unsurprising) disappointment: Digital Commissioner Mariya Gabriel expressed disappointment as she wanted EU countries to have made an agreement on the text by now. She urged “the incoming Finnish presidency [to] tackle the remaining points.” Finland will take the helm of the EU Council in July, but already hinted it would not reach a general approach on the file.

GDPR AT CJEU: A German court asked a preliminary question to the Court of Justice of the EU on the scope of the right of data access by users under the GDPR. The court wishes to know whether the right of access is “applicable to the committee of a parliament of a constituent state of a Member State that is responsible for processing the petitions of citizens — namely the Petitions Committee of the Hesse Land Parliament.” H/T Frederik Borgesius.

DIGITIZATION AND AI AMONG THE PARLIAMENT LEADERS’ FIVE PRIORITIES: Leaders of the European Parliament last week agreed on five areas they want the EU to prioritize over the next five years, according to the group leaders' agreement seen by POLITICO’s Florian Eder. Environmental and climate issues top the list, followed by economic, competition policy and industrial policy; taxation; innovation, digitalization, artificial intelligence and consumer protection; rule of law and fundamental rights.

Austrian EPP MEPs make committee picks: The delegation of former chancellor Sebastian Kurz, which has seven MEPs, is led by Othmar Karas. Several parliamentarians will ask for committees involved in tech regulation: Karas himself wants to be on the Industry committee, Karoline Edtstadler on the Civil Liberties and Legal Affairs committees, Barbara Thaler on the Internal Market committee and Alexander Bernhuber on the Culture committee.

G20 AGREES, OR DOES IT? Over the weekend, finance ministers from the world's largest economies agreed to overhaul how the likes of Google and Facebook pay taxes worldwide, a potential breakthrough in the bitter debate about where these tech giants should pay tax. As part of the proposals, which are expected to be finalized by the end of next year, countries will now hammer out the details, including potential divvying up the rights to tax firms when their goods or services are sold locally, even if companies don't have a physical presence nationally. If that still doesn't work, governments may then be able to levy a global minimum tax rate.

At first, it's hard not to see this as a victory for France (and the United Kingdom), both countries that have pushed ahead with their own local (digital revenue) taxes because of the lack of a consensus, either across the EU or globally. Speaking at the G20 conference, France's Bruno Le Maire said: ""We have a new economic model based on digital activities and based on the sale and exchange and use of massive data.”

But, but, but: The United States still remains opposed to such digital taxes, claiming that they represent unfair taxation against its tech giants, whereas other countries' global firms (like Germany's automakers) get a free pass under the proposed new regime. With more than a year to go before these rules are supposed to come into force, expect a heavy lobbying fight to either water down the digital tax proposals, or efforts to extend them to other parts of the global economy (where other countries' firms dominate).

Yes, the G20 is moving ahead. But that doesn't mean the fight is over.

TELECOM MINISTERS’ WISHLIST: Telecom ministers highlighted cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and fair competition as priorities for the next five years, in their conclusions adopted at Friday's Telecoms Council. National governments said: ""Europe’s cybersecurity capacity should be reinforced in order to protect its digital infrastructures, products, services and users, and its global competitiveness and digital sovereignty."" It called for regional hubs on cybersecurity to boost ""technological and industrial capacity."" The text also mentioned the ""importance of transparency, fairness, accountability and responsibility in the use of algorithms, so that online platforms across the EU operate in a transparent and predictable manner.""

MACRON TALKS 'SMART REGULATION' WITH TWITTER CEO: The French president Emmanuel Macron met with Jack Dorsey Friday in Paris to discuss the G7 Call to Action and Twitter's efforts on content regulation. ""People want more safety, more privacy, more trust on the web. They want their lives protected and democracy preserved. You are willing to make Twitter a safer place and I share this goal. I count on you [Jack Dorsey] to deliver together on smart regulation, transparency, data ownership,"" Macron tweeted after the meeting. Dorsey said (in French) he would continue working towards a ""safer internet."" The Élysée palace did not reply to a request for comment.

MICROSOFT CUTS DEAL WITH FRENCH TAX AUTHORITIES: The U.S. company agreed last year to pay €350 million in back taxes to cover the 2010-2012 period, according to French media. French authorities made similar deals with Amazon and Apple. “Neither [the ministry of economy] nor Microsoft have officially communicated on the agreement,” ZDNet added.

THE RUSSIA EDITION: Russia’s telecoms regulator said nine major VPNs would soon be blocked because they refused to deny access to sites featuring on the country's national blacklist, TorrentFreak reports. Kaspersky Secure Connection, however, agreed to comply, the regulator’s chief said.

Russian disinformation draws ads on YouTube: Researchers found that 14 YouTube channels linked to Russia and spreading fake news generated billions of views and millions of dollars in ad revenues. Also, videos from those channels were not labeled as state-sponsored, despite pledges from Google’s YouTube to flag such content. Read more on Reuters.

CHIFFRE DU JOUR: €55 billion. That’s how much more the rolling out of 5G networks in Europe would cost without Chinese vendors Huawei and ZTE, according to a study by GSMA.

UK can’t make up its mind on tech

Digital Politics is a column about the global intersection of technology and the world of politics.

LONDON — There's a lot Britain can't agree on. Brexit. Who should be the country's next prime minister. Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party.

Add to that list: What to do about tech.

This week, London — still Europe's tech capital despite the ongoing political uncertainty — will play host to its annual ""tech week"" — part marketing ploy, part cheerleading fest to showcase what the British capital, and the rest of the country, has to offer when it comes to glitzy startups, venture capital investment and government support for the digital economy.

Yet in Westminster's halls of power, the hipster mecca of East London and the well-heeled offices of Mayfair, two rival factions are bickering over the health of the U.K.'s tech sector — and how it will fare once the country eventually leaves the European Union.

On one side are the optimists, those who cite the country's record tech investment figures since it voted for Brexit in 2016 as a sign that everything is going great. They dismiss the current political impasse as a mere speed bump on the road to the U.K. putting tech at the center of its future industrial strategy.

On the other side stand the pessimists, who fret about the gradual slowdown of highly educated (European) tech migrants rocking up to fill much-needed jobs in both startups and legacy tech companies. On top of that, the government's aggressive push to regulate the industry — everything from proposed new digital taxes on Big Tech to greater policing of people's social media chatter — has raised eyebrows about its future support for local tech.

The stakes could not be higher.

The U.K. government has largely bet its economic future on the country's burgeoning digital sector. And so far, it can't make up its mind whether to double down on its assistance for local firms and international giants like Google and Facebook — be it through hundreds of millions of pounds of public funding or high-profile digital skills programs — or fall in line with politicians worldwide and the growing ""techlash"" against all things digital.

""They really need to attract investment funds to make sure the tech sector keeps growing,"" said Luca Schiavoni, a digital regulation analysts at Assembly Research, a consultancy firm in London. ""But at the same time, it's really difficult to run into someone in Westminster who believes the tech sector doesn't need more regulation.""

Surely it doesn't have to be a binary choice between pro-industry public policies and arguably one of the toughest regulatory clampdowns anywhere in the Western world?

But just like the other hot-button socio-economic topics now confronting the British public, what to ""do"" about tech needs an answer. And it needs one quickly.

What's muddying the waters is how the local tech scene has faired since the 2016 Brexit referendum. Depending on whom you talk to, the country's digital economy is either full steam ahead or rocketing toward a cliff edge.

Figures published on Monday by TechNation (a quasi-government entity) paint a rosy picture, with U.K. venture capital investment last year hitting $8.7 billion — easily outmatching France and Germany to claim top spot in European tech funding. The number of U.K. startups worth at least $1 billion in 2018 also reached 13, more than all similar fledgling firms in Germany, Israel and Sweden combined.

On top of that, local lawmakers have earmarked hundreds of millions of additional funding through the British Business Bank (another quasi-government institution) to help local techies. Industry veterans — many of whom invested locally, so have skin in the game to play up the positives — also highlight London's continued ability to attract top talent as reasons why Westminster's disjointed approach to the sector should not be cause for concern.

""The U.K. is not the only country having a problem with politics,"" said Martin Mignot, a French partner at Index Ventures, a London-based fund whose investments include Transferwise, a successful local foreign currency exchange startup, and Net-A-Porter, the British e-commerce giant. ""But once you've got the basics like rule of law and functioning democracy, startups aren't going to do badly or well just because of the political situation.""

Not everyone is so sanguine.

While the U.K. government has increased the number of visas for foreign nationals looking to start a tech (or other) business, many in industry aren't convinced that the current conveyor belt of international talent will continue when the country finally leaves the 28-nation bloc.

Britain has already lost its top spot among EU destinations as the place to go for the region's tech workers, according to data from LinkedIn.

In 2017, 14.9 percent of all Europe's tech talent headed to the U.K. in search of work, compared with 13.8 percent of workers traveling to Germany, the second most popular country. But last year, Germany pulled even with Britain, with both garnering 14.6 percent of all EU digital nomads, while France — championed by its president, Emmanuel Macron — has done all that it can to knock the U.K. off its perch as the region's top digital ecosystem.

It's not just talent that may be drying up. A recent survey by KPMG and IHS Markit, two consultancies, shows that economic output from the U.K.'s tech sector had begun to slow, though it's still expanding each quarter at a faster rate than other sectors, and wages to attract and hold onto talent have skyrocketed, hurting businesses' overall bottom lines.

For Giles Derrington, associate director of policy at TechUK, a local trade body whose members include global giants like Google and Apple as well as U.K. players like chip designer ARM Holdings and Sage, the digital accountancy provider, this uncertainty is making it harder for companies to justify future investment in Britain — particularly when the chances of a no-deal Brexit are on the rise.

""The U.K. has always been an obvious center for investment into the EU,"" he said. ""Now, that's a lot harder case to make for businesses. They don't have a clear sense of what the rule of law will look like in the U.K. for the foreseeable future.""",mainstream
553,"It’s always been hard being Donald Trump, Jr. “Every time you check in at an airport, it’s ‘Oh, my god, you’re Donald Trump’s son,’” he told me when I spoke to him for my biography of the Trump family. But in the wake of reports that a year ago he had a secret Trump Tower meeting with a lawyer who promised dirt on Hillary Clinton from Russian government sources, it’s gotten a lot harder.

As with many incidents on the growing list of encounters between Russian operatives and Trump campaign and administration officials, it’s unclear whether this particular meet-up will lead to criminal charges or be written off as what White House chief of staff Reince Priebus has called “a big nothing burger.”

But at the least, it provides an opportunity to see whether Donald Jr., now 39, who once told me, “It would be nice not to have people prejudge you because they see your father a certain way and there’s no chance you might actually be different,” has finally emerged as his own man; or whether, in wanting too much to please his father, he has been an overeager and incautious servant.

When I interviewed Donald Jr., it was at the groundbreaking for construction of Trump Tower Chicago in October 2004. He was 26, and he said that in the four years he had been working for his father, the Trump Organization had changed from being “very New York-centric” to having projects all over the country, “It’s not entirely my doing,” he said, “but these are things I’ve helped push. It’s such a huge brand, it could be global.”

My recollection of him at the time was of someone happy to be where he was. At that age, his father had been itching to take over the company, but Donald Jr. seemed comfortable waiting his turn, “I’m on my way,” he said, “but right now I’m still learning.” He worked hard, but he wasn’t a 24/7 guy like his father; instead, he was “more grounded” and could “lay back in my personal life.” Although “The Apprentice,” then in its second season, was a smash hit, he had no appetite for being on television himself and said, “You’re unlikely to have ‘The Apprentice Jr.’” (In 2007, however, he would join the show, taking a seat at the conference table alongside his father.)

Nonetheless, over the past five days, Donald Trump Jr., 39, has emerged, for less than ideal reasons, from behind his father’s substantial shadow. What made him agree to the meeting last June, at a moment when his father’s campaign was struggling to consolidate its hold on the GOP nomination? History is littered with examples of first sons and their difficult relationships with their fathers and the Trumps are not so different in this regard. What drove the younger Trump likely lies in a bond that had more than its share of drama and in which both father and son disappointed each other many times before they reached a truce on the 26th floor of Trump Tower.

When Donald Jr. was born, on New Year’s Eve, 1977, his father, then 31, had already taken over the family business, bonded with infamous fixer Roy Cohn, sued the federal government for $100 million, wrangled an unprecedented tax abatement for his first major construction project in New York, the Grand Hyatt, and launched the brand-building, headline-grabbing M.O. that would eventually net him the presidency. There was little chance that his son would wander through life unnoticed.

Growing up in a palatial super-luxury 53-room triplex penthouse atop Trump Tower and attended by nannies and bodyguards, Donald Jr. and his two siblings, Ivanka and Eric, saw little of their workaholic father, who spent every waking hour at his 26th-floor desk. Instead it was their mother, Ivana, a former model, who organized schedules packed with lessons and sports and the elaborate birthday parties children of the very rich tend to have in Manhattan.

“I brought up the children singlehandedly,” Ivana Trump said in October 2016 at a benefit in New York according to the New York Daily News. “Donald wasn’t really interested in the children until he could talk business with them. When they turned 21, I handed them over to him and said ‘Here’s the finished product, you can take them from here.’”

Donald Sr. talked about his somewhat distant relationship with his children in his book ""The Art of the Deal,"" which came out in 1987. “I adore [my three children], but I’ve never been great at playing with toy trucks and dolls,” he wrote. “Now, though, Donny is beginning to get interested in buildings and real estate and sports, and that’s great.” His son was not quite 10 years old at the time the book came out, so just how interested he might have been in real estate is open to debate. “I tell Donny I’ll be home as soon as I can, but he insists on a time. Perhaps he’s got my genes: the kid won’t take no for answer.”

During the school year the children attended exclusive private schools — Donald Jr. was at all-boys Buckley — and spent time with their Trump grandparents, who lived in Queens, and with Ivana’s Czech parents, Milos and Maria Zelnicek, who lived in Trump Tower six months of the year. In the summer, according to New York Magazine, they went back with Ivana’s parents to Czechoslovakia, where they polished their Czech— Donald Jr. reportedly speaks the language fluently—and Milos passed on to his grandsons his passion for hunting and fishing. “My father is a very hardworking guy,” Donald Jr. told New York, “and that’s his focus in life, so I got a lot of the paternal attention that a boy wants and needs from my grandfather.”

This privileged but predictable routine changed dramatically and, for the children, traumatically in 1990, when the Trump marriage hit the rocks and Donald Sr. moved to a smaller apartment in Trump Tower. The ferocious tabloid coverage of the messy breakup rattled the oldest son. (”Best Sex I Ever Had!” had to be a particularly confusing explanation of the split for a kid who hadn’t even hit his teens.) “It’s not easy at 12 to walk out of school and see the front page of every newspaper talking about your parents’ divorce,” Donald Jr. told me. After being ridiculed by schoolmates and, according to Vanity Fair, reduced to tears by a newspaper report that his father and his mistress, model Marla Maples, were spotted at an Elton John concert, Donald Jr. told his father, “All you love is your money” and refused to speak to him for the next year.

In 1991, Donald Jr. was packed off to the Hill School, a Pennsylvania boarding school that was known for being regimented. It was the kind of place many teens might have resented, but according to New York, Donald Jr. found being there a relief. “There was a time when my parents had a lot of security guards around. Again, one of those things that I probably rebelled against,” he told the magazine. “And then, when I went to boarding school, it all kind of went away — all those inconveniences that I found obtrusive.”

He still blamed his father for the divorce, and in 1993 he refused to attend his father’s wedding to Marla, an over-the-top affair at the Plaza Hotel that featured a 7-foot-tall cake, giant bowls of caviar, and a celebrity guest list that included O.J. Simpson, Rosie O'Donnell and Howard Stern. But he didn’t completely break free of his father’s orbit: He spent summers working as a dock attendant in Atlantic City and at Trump Organization construction sites, and he attended his father’s alma mater, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

But, unlike his famously teetotaling father, when the younger Trump was at Wharton he earned a reputation as a belligerent boozer. “I used to drink a lot and party pretty hard,” he told New York, “and it wasn’t something I was particularly good at. I mean, I was good at it, but I couldn’t do it in moderation.”

Although his father had seen him as drawn to real estate, Donald Jr. raced in the other direction after college—heading to Aspen to keep the party going. His parents didn’t approve and the speculation was that Donald Jr.’s job tending boats in Atlantic City would be the last time he worked for his dad. But after a year he grew tired of the mindless high life in Aspen and returned to the fold in New York. “I knew that [working for my father] was something that I wanted,” he told New York. “I was following my dad around from a young age. I don’t know if it’s genetic or just because I was surrounded by it, but I was always fascinated with building and construction and development. I guess I just wanted to make sure I was making the right decision.” In 2000, he began working at the Trump Organization as executive vice president for development and acquisitions, and five years later, again following his father’s example, he married a model, Vanessa Haydon, with whom he would have five children.

Like his sister Ivanka, Donald Jr. likes to present himself as someone with his own opinions. “I’m the one person who can stand up to my father,” he told me. “I’m the only one who’s not afraid to pull him aside and say, ‘Here, take a look at the larger picture.’”

But again like Ivanka, the public has seen no evidence of him having any such forthright talks with his father, much less any suggestion that his father changed course as a result. Perhaps he saw what happened to his mother, who pushed to have a major role in the business. After doing better as head of one of the Trump-owned casinos in Atlantic City than Donald Sr.’s own team, she was rewarded with the top job at the Plaza Hotel, then owned by Donald Sr., and his public taunt that her salary would be a dollar a year and all the dresses she wanted.

So is there a chance that Donald Jr. is different from his father? Or is he perhaps more similar, and more devoted, than he would care to acknowledge?

His father is known for being a remarkable cheapskate, and so is he. In 2004, following his father’s lead in getting a hefty discount on Melania’s engagement and wedding rings in exchange for a mention of Graff, the seller, on “The Apprentice,” Donald Jr. invited the news media to his own bended-knee proposal to Vanessa at a New Jersey strip-mall jewelry store in exchange for a $100,000 engagement ring.

During the campaign and now during the Trump administration, he has followed in his father’s rhetorical footsteps, retweeting white nationalist memes and giving a radio interview (he says unwittingly) to a white supremacist. On another occasion, he compared Syrian refugees to a bowl full of Skittles candies and said “a couple of these will kill you.” At other times, he has even acted as his father’s attack dog. During James Comey’s testimony in June before the Senate Intelligence Committee, while Donald Sr. maintained an uncharacteristic silence, Donald Jr. kept up a steady stream of combative tweets.

Similarly, during the current controversy over the 30-minute chat with the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, at which his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort were also present, Donald Jr. has provided Donald Sr.-style contradictory responses. After Kushner was forced to acknowledge that such a conversation had occurred, Donald Jr. suddenly recalled that he was also there, came up with two different explanations for why, and posted tweets about the incident that were, not unlike his father, long on sarcasm and short on facts.

After these responses didn’t calm the waters, Donald Jr. hired a prominent white-collar defense lawyer, Alan Futerfas, whose Fifth Avenue office is a short walk from Trump Tower and who has represented defendants linked to organized crime.

At this point, Donald Sr., as per his practice of distancing himself from anyone who poses a threat, proceeded to do just that. During the first three days after the story of Donald Jr.’s meeting broke in the New York Times, Donald Sr. fiercely defended Ivanka’s having sat in for him at the G20 meetings in Hamburg the previous week but remained silent about his son’s apparent efforts to help him.

On the fourth day, Donald Jr. released what he said was his entire email exchange about arrangements for the meeting, A few hours later, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders read the president’s first response to the matter in what is becoming the administration’s signature style, an off-camera briefing. In its 12-word entirety, the statement read, “My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency.”

The next day, Donald Sr. tapped out two more tweets, calling Donald Jr. “innocent,” labeling the ever-louder coverage “the greatest Witch Hunt in political history."" That afternoon he told Reuters, ""I think many people would have held that meeting."" But, as he had since returning from the G20 summit, the man who never turns down a chance to stand in front of a camera remained behind closed doors until he boarded Air Force One for a state visit to France.

Back in 2015, when Trump was still duking it out with the other Republican candidates for the presidential nomination, Barbara Walters asked him to name the most challenging of his children. Without hesitation, albeit with just a hint of humor, Trump had responded, “Don.” Since that time, Trump has won not only the GOP nomination but the presidential election, and he is now the most powerful man in the world. But the answer, it seems, is still the same.

551,"A Pennsylvania man who accused Bigfoot of vandalizing his 1973 Winnebago earlier this month is just one of a long history of people who have blamed the hairy humanoid for attacking personal property and dwellings.

John Reed, a Bigfoot enthusiast, claims that during a camping trip he and his girlfriend saw a tall, dark, hairy figure walk past their camper window at night. According to one news story, Reed said the Bigfoot ""threw rocks at his mobile home's outside light to escape discovery.""

This explanation doesn't make sense; if the Bigfoot didn't want to be noticed, it presumably wouldn't have walked right past the Winnebago's window with two people inside, nor thrown rocks at the camper. The creature could simply have avoided the campsite, or kept walking into the darkness if it did not want to be detected, instead of standing and throwing rocks at an exterior light.

• All lightning on Earth may have its roots in space, new research suggests.
• How our brains can track a 100 mph pitch

Perhaps the strangest part of the story is that Reed, who founded a Bigfoot hunting group and claims to have seen it twice before, did not photograph the creature. [ Bigfoot, Nessie & the Kraken: Cryptozoology Quiz ]

Reed is not alone 

As odd as this story seems, Reed is not the first to claim to find traces and evidence of what they assume must have been a Bigfoot, though not clearly seeing or photographing it at the time. The logic goes like this: I don't know what else it might have been, so it must have been Bigfoot.

It is well known that wild animals attack vehicles such as car and RVs — especially if they can smell food inside. And many animals, including bears and raccoons, can be very clever and persistent in trying to get into vehicles and other containers. Trashcans in national parks have specially designed latching mechanisms to thwart feral intruders.

There have been other cases where unknown creatures attack vehicles, though those attacks have typically occurred at night and/or while the occupants were away. Strangely, Bigfoot are never credibly accused of attacking people; just about every other animal in the world has been known to attack humans at some point, including cats, dogs, deer, moose, bear, boar, elk, cougar, birds, fish, and so on. Not so for Bigfoot — a fact that raises suspicion among many skeptics.

Bigfoot have been claimed to vandalize not only dwellings but also trees. In October 2011, Bigfoot researcher and biologist John Bindernagel visited western Siberia to examine evidence of the Yeti (the Russian version of Bigfoot). He claimed to have found evidence that the creature broke trees and branches. ""Twisted trees like this have also been observed in North America and they could fit with the theory that Bigfoot makes nests,"" Bindernagelsaid in an interview with the British tabloid ""The Sun.""

In another mysterious incident that some attribute to Bigfoot or another unknown creature, in 2008 a South Carolina couple claimed that something vandalized their vehicle, leaving mysterious bite marks and ripping out part of the fender on their 2002 Dodge Grand Caravan.

Famous 1924 Bigfoot Attack 

The most famous case of a Bigfoot attack allegedly occurred at a place called Ape Canyon, near Mount St. Helens, Washington. In 1924, a group of five miners working at the site were besieged by a group of ""ape men."" One of the miners, a man named Fred Beck, claimed that they sighted a group of Bigfoot high above them on the edge of the canyon. The miners then spent a terrified night holed up in their cabin, during which the Bigfoot bombarded the cabin with rocks, and, they claimed, even tried to break the door in. The miners couldn't get a good look at the Bigfoot—partly because it was dark and partly because they could only see outside through small cracks in the door and walls.

The incident was cited for years in Bigfoot lore as a classic Bigfoot attack, and the details were exaggerated with each retelling. For example a few dozen fist-size rocks that rained down on the roof and walls became ""giant boulders"" in some versions of the story. Later research found that the famous Ape Canyon Bigfoot attack was not a hoax — but nor was it real: it was instead a combination of a prank and misperceptions.

It seems that the ""Bigfoot"" were local YMCA youth from nearby Spirit Lake, who had a long tradition of throwing stones (including pumice rocks, which can be deceptively light for their size) down into the canyon from above. The kids would not have known the miners were in the canyon, nor even that they were necessarily hitting a cabin in the darkness far below. When the miners looked up they would have only seen silhouettes of figures far above them. It must surely have been a terrifying experience for the miners, and it's easy to see how the Bigfoot story could have been spawned. [ Who Believes in Bigfoot? ]

Could something similar explain the recent incident in Pennsylvania? Reed says he believes that the damage to his Winnebago wasn't caused by a group of pranking kids, though police think that's exactly what it was and are treating the case as ordinary vandalism. If Reed wants to file an insurance claim for the damages to his camper, he might want to go with that story.

Todd May says he stumbled upon the head of Sasquatch itself whilst hiking near his home in Utah.

Of course, it could just be a large rock that kind of looks like it's got a face on it.

But May is positive he's onto something with the 34kg skull - because he says he's sighted Bigfoot twice before.

Footage shot in the south east Asian country appears to show an enormous creature walking upright through a waterfall and rolling green hillside.

While on the somewhat distorted clip it can't be determined exactly what the creature is, some conspiracy theorists are believing it may finally be the real deal.

The video begins with a wide shot of a stunning Indonesian mountain range.

All appears still and quiet until suddenly there's movement to the left of a waterfall.

What looks to be the large Bigfoot emerges out of nowhere, walking in front of the cascading water.

After just a short few seconds the large figure - which appears to be glistening in the sun - disappears from view, but is incredibly forever recorded on camera.

While the Daily Star reports that some think the video is legitimate, others are a bit more skeptical.

Some believe that judging from the height of the creature in comparison to the waterfall, the video is just one of hundreds of fakes littered across the internet.

It is unclear when the legend of Bigfoot, also called Sasquatch, was first created, however most sightings are attributed to being black bears.

460,"When shopping for shoes, you want to have more than fashion in mind — you'll also want to consider function and keeping your feet in good shape. These 10 tips can help you choose the right shoes:
• Take a tracing of your foot with you. Place any shoe you think you might buy on top of the tracing. If the shoe is narrower or shorter than the tracing, don't even try it on.
• Shop for shoes during the afternoon — your foot naturally expands with use during the day.
• Wear the same type of socks to the store that you intend to wear with the shoes.
• Have a salesperson measure both of your feet — and get measured every time you buy new shoes. Feet change with age, often growing larger and wider. If one foot is larger than the other, buy a size that fits the larger foot.
• Stand in the shoes. Press gently on the top of the shoe to make sure you have about a half-inch of space between your longest toe and the end of the shoe. This provides enough room for your foot to press forward as you walk. Wiggle your toes to make sure there's enough room.
• Walk around in the shoes to determine how they feel. Is there enough room at the balls of the feet? Do the heels fit snugly, or do they pinch or slip off? Don't rationalize that the shoes just need to be ""broken in."" Find shoes that fit from the start.
• Trust your own comfort level rather than a shoe's size or description. Sizes vary between manufacturers. And no matter how comfortable an advertisement claims those shoes are, you're the real judge.
• Pay attention to width as well as length. If the ball of your foot feels compressed in a particular shoe, ask if it comes in a wider size. Buying shoes that are a half-size bigger — but not any wider — won't necessarily solve the problem.
• Feel the inside of the shoes to see if they have any tags, seams, or other material that might irritate your foot.
• Examine the soles. Are they sturdy enough to provide protection from sharp objects? Do they provide any cushioning? Take note of how they feel as you walk around the shoe store. Try to walk on hard surfaces as well as carpet to see how the shoe feels on both.

464,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - New Argentina coach Edgardo Bauza believes a softy, softly approach is the way to try to bring talisman Lionel Messi back into the national team.

Bauza, officially unveiled as Gerardo Martino’s successor at Argentine FA headquarters on Friday, said he would seek to speak with retired captain Messi in Barcelona next week.

“My sole intention is to see if I can talk about football with Messi... and from that chat will come the possibility of him being called up to play Argentina’s next games,” Bauza told a news conference.

Less than a month after Bauza took charge, Argentina face 2018 World Cup qualifiers at home to Uruguay and away to Venezuela in the first week of September.

“I want to tell him my idea and for him to tell me how things are with him and then we’ll see what comes out of it,” Bauza said.

Messi quit the team after his fourth major final defeat with Argentina, and third as their captain, at the Copa America in the United States in June.

There is a widespread belief that the 29-year-old will revise a decision he took in the heat of the moment and look to try and take part in a fourth World Cup in Russia in 2018.

Bauza, a lanky former central defender who has won the Copa Libertadores twice as a coach, said he understood Messi’s reaction to a second successive Copa America final defeat on penalties against Chile.

“I have felt frustrated for losing a match or a final and understand that statement (of quitting) when you are overwhelmed with frustration, but I know it can be reversed.” said Bauza, who is known as ‘Paton’ (big foot).

Argentina are third in the 10-nation South American group with 11 points from six matches, two points behind leading pair Uruguay and Ecuador.

940,"London, United Kingdom - In July 2017, Despacito, a popular reggaeton hit from Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, became the most widely streamed record of all time, with a version featuring Canadian superstar Justin Bieber helping the tune to more than 4.6 billion plays since it was released in the January of that year.

A decade ago, reggaeton would have been an unlikely choice of genre for the most popular song on the planet - played in clubs, on radio stations and in dance classes everywhere - with the broadening appeal of previously niche tastes just one aspect in which the music industry has fundamentally changed with the spread of streaming technologies.
• Tencent Music's revenues find their groove with more paying users

But the growth of streaming has had another, often overlooked, impact - it is directly contributing to environmental degradation, even as the environmental byproducts of producing physical products such as clunky CD players or racks full of vinyls has decreased.

A group of researchers from the European Commission, led by Dr Rabih Bashroush, found that those 4.6 billion streams of Despacito had used as much electricity as the combined annual electricity consumption of Chad, Guinea-Bissau, Somalia, Sierra Leone and the Central African Republic.

The greenhouse gas emissions of video-on-demand services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime are equivalent to the emissions of a country such as Chile, according to the Shift Project, a French think-tank which has published several reports advocating for digital sobriety. This body of research is starting to swell, as consumers and companies alike start to reckon with their environmental impact in other areas.

""People can't assume that just because something doesn't have a physical format, that it's got no carbon attached to it,"" says Sharon George, a lecturer in environmental science at Keele University. ""There's still electronic use, servers involved, and the digital world does still have a carbon footprint.""

These emissions are seen on several fronts. On a very basic level, the emissions arise from the power necessary for keeping devices on (or charging them), as well as the energy necessary to store and share information. Data centres - which host servers that process and redistribute internet traffic - also require a huge amount of energy expenditure, and global data flows go through data centres around the world.

They're estimated to account for about 0.3 percent of all global carbon dioxide emissions.

""Even back in 2012, I knew from reading some good journalism that digital files are material things, and the internet was not weightless,"" says Kyle Devine, a professor at the University of Oslo and the author of Decomposed, a book about the material implications of streaming music. ""But I didn't find much in the literature which addressed music.""

Slowly, he started to look at what went into making it possible to download and stream music, using resources such as Greenpeace's Click Clean Scorecard, which examines the energy practices of streaming companies.

Streaming technologies - such as Netflix and Spotify - have been around for a relatively short period of time, and the idea that they may have an environmental impact is new, at least to people not working in the field.

But research from the Shift Project and a special report from the EU Commission indicate roughly the same findings - that streaming technologies have a more significant carbon footprint than we previously thought, and that it is unlikely to decrease soon. Digital technologies, according to the Shift Project, are responsible for 4 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, a proportion which could double by 2025.

Online video streaming - YouTube, Hulu and the like - accounts for 60 percent of that figure, currently emitting 306 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year.

The relationship between listening to a few songs on Spotify and emitting greenhouse gases might seem a little tenuous but researchers from these very companies have also identified compelling links.

""Although streaming an individual album uses much less energy than listening to an album on CD, or an LP, we stream such vast amounts of music that the gains in energy efficiency are outstripped by an overall increase in the amount we listen to,"" says Devine.

In his book, Devine used research from 2015/2016 compiled by Greenpeace to understand what kinds of energy were used to power the streaming technologies behind giant companies such as Spotify. In the past few years, as these platforms have grown in scale, those emissions have increased in size and frequency.

Streaming is often thought of as an immaterial act - but Devine asserts that such an idea is false: ""Techno-fixes are usually not the answer - if we need more transparency and better practice from the industries, we may also need to closely examine the culture of listening that has built up around online music over the last two decades. We may need to question a culture of listening that expects instant access, infinite storage and constant use.""

""We use IT in so many different ways,"" she says. ""IT can provide a platform to decarbonise other areas of society too, such as in transport, where technology can replace flights or travel to conferences, but there's a role for those companies to be carbon neutral or even carbon negative.""

There are also worries around hardware - touch screens, cables, and so on - that may not be sustainably produced or disposed of, contributing further to the carbon footprint of certain technologies. Other dimensions - such as the kind of file that's being downloaded, the resolution, the electricity needed to charge your devices - is difficult to factor in, so the real picture may even be more destructive than we already know.

""Like food labels, there are a lot of people who are prepared to change their behaviour if you help them,"" says Bashroush, who led the European Commission project. ""But there are so many moving pieces and factors, so people don't necessarily understand their consumption and their carbon footprint.""

Bashroush suggests a couple of quick fixes - such as downloading a song to your local device instead of streaming music from a distant server - but also asserts that might not be enough. ""The question is why doesn't the industry regulate itself,"" says Bashroush. ""There’s no incentive for anyone to do so.""

Streaming companies make money from advertisements. Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix, said in 2017 that Netflix's main competition was sleep - companies that make money from streaming are unlikely to self-regulate to encourage people to think about their footprints.

Fans of online TV and music are not necessarily aware that their consumption habits have such a direct relationship to greenhouse gas emissions, or even that they create a carbon footprint at all. The infrastructure of the internet - particularly technologies now seen as commonplace, such as online video - can be difficult to understand in real terms.

""We need to be using renewables to power the technology revolution,"" adds George. ""You wouldn't buy a lightbulb without knowing how many watts it was using, so companies need to be raising awareness and they need to be more transparent.""

EU legislation has specified that servers in data centres must fit certain parameters but, other than a few cursory attempts, there is little regulation globally around the carbon footprint of streaming technologies.

While there are some tweaks or fixes that can be made to minimise one's personal online environmental impact, it may all be for nothing without significant effort on the part of the companies and corporations responsible.

Devine posits that individual awareness can build into a collective conscience, which can lead to requirements for industry transparency and government regulation. But legislation on the matter may be difficult to enforce - how can any one government ensure certain uses of personal technology, without comprising severely on other values? Would the impact be evenly spread, or would some people struggle far more as a result?

""I don't know that monitoring our individual streaming accounts will be of much help,"" says Devine. ""In fact, I think that framing these issues in terms of personal responsibility is actually a part of the problem. If we feel that we are doing our part to address environmental issues, it's possible that bigger companies can continue growing bigger, consuming resources, exploiting people and expelling pollution.""",mainstream

1336,"Public traffic flowed for the first time across what is now Germany's second-highest road bridge on Thursday afternoon.

The Hochmoselbrücke, or High Mosel Bridge, stretches 1.7 kilometers (1 mile) across and 160 meters (524 feet) above the Mosel River in western Germany.

Within Germany, the new bridge in the Rhineland-Palatinate is second only to the 185-meter-high Kochertal bridge in the southern state of Baden-Württemberg.

Authorities expect about 25,000 vehicles a day to cross the bridge that now provides a direct link between the regions of Eifel and Hunsrück.

Several hundred people gathered for the bridge's opening on Thursday. Over the weekend, thousands of pedestrians crossed the bridge by foot as part of the opening festivities.

""Today is a good day for the Rhineland-Palatinate,"" said State Premier Malu Dreyer. She added that she was convinced ""that the bridge will help advance our economically strong state even further and will strengthen ties between the people in Eifel and Hunsrück.""

The controversial building project kicked off eight years ago. Some critics argued that the massive bridge would destroy the area's idyllic vineyard landscape, while environmentalists argued it would pollute the ground water.

Others spoke out against the cost. The building of the bridge was part of a greater road project that included the construction of an additional 25 kilometers (16 miles) of federal highway. The total project is estimated to havecost €483 million ($535 million), with €175 million dedicated to the bridge alone.

The opening brings an end to what had been the largest ongoing construction project in Europe.

The bridge and the new stretch of federal highway constitute part of a larger, long-distance road project that will eventually link the Rhine-Main area near Frankfurt with the states of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.

362,"A photograph taken of a lizard on La Palma, Canary Islands, in July 2007 and published in the Spanish national newspaper El País has been considered evidence of another species of so-called giant lizard from the Canary Islands. This information was echoed by Richard P. Brown in the Conservation News of Oryx (42, 171–172). Although some photographs can lead to the discovery of a new species or prove the existence of supposedly extinct ones, others, such as those of the Loch Ness monster in Scotland, have only produced a topic for animated conversation, along with varied explanations, popular beliefs or legends. The lizard's photograph was also published in regional newspapers and eventually another photograph was published in the Bulletin of the Spanish Herpetological Society (Mínguez et al., 2007; Boletín de la Asociación Herpetológica Española, 18, 11–13). According to the authors the lizard corresponds to the extinct Gallotia auaritae, a taxon previously described as a subspecies of Gallotia simonyi based on subfossil remains.

However, the photograph does not provide good scientific evidence for the survival of a giant lizard on La Palma, and the lizard could actually be the abundant native species Gallotia galloti. The authors excluded this species from consideration because of its size and colouration. They mentioned that the snout-vent length (SVL) of G. galloti palmae, the endemic subspecies of La Palma, never exceeds 120 mm. But on Tenerife the SVL of G. galloti clearly surpasses this length, and on Roque de Fuera de Anaga some individuals reach at least 145 mm SVL. Moreover at some localities on La Palma it is possible to observe large specimens of G. galloti palmae similar in size to the lizards found on Tenerife. The picture of the supposed giant lizard was taken at a distance of c. 10 m and the total length (301–312 mm) and SVL (157–167 mm) were estimated a few months later by comparison with the surrounding plants and stones. The way these measurements were taken is obviously not very reliable and therefore it is uncertain if the lizard was a large G. galloti or a small G. auaritae.

With respect to the colouration, the authors indicate that the photograph is not that of G. g. palmae because the dorsum is very dark and lacking any markings and the gular region is not blue. However, the colouration in G. galloti is very variable, and lizards from the north of Tenerife are similar to G. g. palmae. The lizards from the south of Tenerife look different and, curiously, their general colouration is very similar to that described for the supposed giant lizard from La Palma. On La Palma, where variation has been less studied, lizards with similar colouration to those found in the southern part of Tenerife but clearly identified as G. g. palmae have been observed. In addition, a zoom of the published photographs show some blue pixels in the gular region and above the fore limbs.

This weak photographic evidence was published after the authors revisited the area without finding any further trace of the lizard. It is clear that if a true giant lizard is discovered on La Palma the population must be small and on the verge of extinction, urgently in need of protection measures. However the finding has not been officially communicated to the local environmental authorities of La Palma. Surprisingly, IUCN has given credit to this supposed discovery, categorizing G. auaritae as Critically Endangered in the 2008 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (http://www.iucnredlist.org). Although it is possible that a giant lizard still survives on some cliff areas of La Palma, as do Gallotia intermedia on Tenerife and Gallotia gomerana on La Gomera, the published information is not convincing. I strongly recommend that IUCN remove this ghost species from the Red List. Evidence for its existence is no stronger than that for the Loch Ness monster, the Yeti of the Himalayas, the Mokele-mbembe of Central Africa or Bigfoot of North America.",mainstream

846,"Not since footage emerged of a giant, ape-like figure in the California woods in the late 1960s has there been so much interest in proving the existence of Bigfoot. So how do you go about finding a creature most people believe to be a myth?

It could be a human footprint. Let's not rule that out.

Kentucky Bigfoot investigators pride themselves on their scientific rigour.

They compile detailed reports, take copious notes, and rely on high-tech recording equipment to set their traps and document their work.

Every twisted branch or broken twig is carefully examined for clues. Every distant sound in the trees seized on as a possible sign of ""activity"".

Which is how I came to be standing on the bank of a stream on a warm spring day staring at an indentation in the shingle.

Someone had pointed it out as a potential footprint. It was certainly big enough. Maybe even too big.

But as Charlie, our team leader, got to work with a tape measure, I assured myself that it was probably human.

And that's when I knew they had got me. Probably is not a word I would have used a few hours ago, when we set out.

Back then I would have said it was definitely human. But back then my scepticism was impregnable. Now it was starting to fray at the edges.

Maybe this is how it starts.

People have reported seeing strange, ape-like creatures in the forests of North America for centuries.

Frontiersman Daniel Boone is meant to have shot and killed one of them. He dubbed the 2.5-m (8.2-ft) tall beast a Yahoo, after the creatures in Jonathan Swift's classic novel Gulliver's Travels.

The Yahoo's descendants have come to be known as Bigfoot in some circles, Sasquatch in others. Whatever you call it, it is currently big news. YouTube is awash with ""sightings"". Most of them are obvious fakes.

But what has really given new life to a very old legend is reality TV and its remorseless appetite for eccentric characters.

It seems like every Sasquatch-spotter, from Canada to the Florida Keys, is in talks with a production company or has already been featured in a reality show of his own.

When a TV crew arrives with a list of pre-planned shots and outlandish things for them to say, the Bigfoot-hunters generally play along.

They know they are being held up to mockery, on some level, but they seem to be in little doubt about Bigfoot's existence.

Joy, a middle-aged healthcare consultant, is the lead investigator with the Kentucky Bigfoot Research Organization.

She says she saw Bigfoot for the first time last autumn. Or, rather, it saw her.

As she was changing out of some wet clothes on a camping trip, she became aware of a hairy male face peeping at her under the tent flap, she told me.

According to Joy, there was an overpowering odour. And she heard a low, guttural grunt. Whatever the creature staring at her was, it was not human.

Joy's boyfriend, Ben, smiled as she told her tale. He is a Bigfoot sceptic - but it's a good excuse for a hike in the woods.

Some native American tribes in the north-west of America believe the Sasquatch is real. Most think of him as a spiritual being, whose appearance before man is meant to convey some kind of message.

One member of the Kentucky group told me he also thinks Bigfoot could be a spiritual manifestation.

Bart Nunnelly has written several books on the mythical creatures that he believes live in the Kentucky forests.

When he was nine, his family told a local newspaper they were being terrorised by giant ape-like creatures.

He has been the subject of ridicule ever since.

After all, there is little conclusive proof that Bigfoot is anything but a myth. Despite their emphasis on scientific fact, the majority of the group's evidence comes in the form of anecdotal bigfoot sightings collected on their website.

The footprint we found, they decided, was most likely human.

But Mr Nunnelly, like all the Bigfoot devotees I met in Kentucky, is not worried about the mockery of sceptics and non-believers.

He seems certain about what he has seen, and that it wasn't human.",mainstream

This was our mindset approaching all barriers we experienced on and off the field.”
• Don’t set limitations on what you can do.
• If it scares you then it means you should do it.
• Don’t wait for others, be the first and go for it.
• It’s okay if you don’t know the rules, all the girls on my team that started didn’t know the rules, and never even watched a game before.



I don’t define my success or highlights by on field success. I think sport plays a bigger role in an athlete’s life off the field. For me, it has allowed me to grow in strides – taught me discipline, resilience and leadership skills. It has been an incredible journey, with many achievements, milestones and experiences that will stay with me forever. At the moment, my main highlight is still to come. I am chasing a big dream to make the AFLW, until then – helping my team, the Auburn Giants win a premiership.”

“I’ll keep working hard, putting my best foot forward in striving for selection in the AFLW. You never know what can happen.



I’m also currently coaching our under 18s girls, so coaching might be another possibility for me in the future.



The final avenue I might explore is in research, as I’m currently completing my PhD in perceptual cognitive skills and decision making for the GWS Giants.""",mainstream
320,"We continue this story of high strangeness from “Strange Disappearances in US National Parks, Part 1/2” by this writer.

Deep within the forests of the United States National Park System (NPS), hundreds of people have gone missing with no trace. Oddly, the NPS seems to have no interest in finding out what is happening to people who have not been victims of animal attacks.

Former police officer David Paulides has published six books in a series called “Missing 411.” More than 1,000 people have disappeared from United States national parks.

After presenting his findings at the 2012 NASAR (National Association for Search and Rescue) conference in South Lake Tahoe, dozens of professionals affirmed what Paulides believes true:

“it is staggering the number of people that simply vanish in the wilds of North America.”

Paulides visited a library near Yosemite National Park to see what he could find out in the local news. One of the first cases he came across was from Sarasota, California. On July 17, 1981, 14-year-old Stacey Arras disappeared inside Yosemite. She was with her dad and a group of eight other people on a horseback pack trip at high altitude (8000-9000 feet) in a very remote area.

The group dismounted at some cabins and Stacey freshened up before walking down a trail with her camera, accompanied by a 71-year-old man in the party. The elderly man sat down to rest about 100 feet down the trail in full view of everybody.

Stacey told him she was going to walk a couple hundred feet further along into a small valley with a lake surrounded by heavy trees to take some pictures. As the rest of the group watched, she walked over the knoll – never to be seen again.

Weeks of massive searching for the missing teen were to no avail. The only evidence found was a lens cap to her camera lying in the middle of the trail at the treeline.

Strangely, the NPS of Yosemite refused to give Paulides’ the case file – even though these events happened 30 years ago. According to Stacy’s family, she has never been found.

Paulides discovered that people have gone missing from Yosemite for quite a long time. For example, on July 20, 1954, 26-year-old Walter Gordon, a graduate student from U.C. Berkeley, told friends he was going to take a short hike to Glacier Point and would be back in a couple of hours. He never came back.

Three months later, on October 9, 1954, Orver von Wass also disappeared from the base of Yosemite after telling his family he was going to take a short walk.

The families of the two youths found each other and compared notes, finding many similarities. They collaborated to write a letter to President Eisenhower and asked for “special warfare troops” to search for their children. The families were convinced that their sons had been abducted rather than lost or hurt in a wilderness area.

Paulides found this to be a common theme of these missing persons cases: 80 percent of the families he encountered believed their relatives had been criminally abducted, would then write a letter to some official organization for help, and all had been refused.

A reasonable question would be, were these people attacked by animals and dragged off? A dog brought in to track scents to the bodies of these missing people typically either walks in circles or lies down, not wanting to track. “The canine is essentially useless in almost every one of these cases.”

There have been far too many cases to describe in this article, but some of the creepier aspects include children who vanish from behind a tree while their parents are looking, only to be found dead, weeks later, at a much higher altitude. The official cause of death is usually given as “exposure.”

Sometimes, young children are found who tell strange stories about where they had been. One case mentioned by Thought Catalog concerned a 6-year-old girl named Lillian from Maine who went missing August 1897 and was found 46 hours later 2-3 miles from where her parents last saw her. She said, “the sun shined all the time while I was in the woods.”

People have reported missing time, reappearing in different clothes, and in different locations.

Often, the deceased are found wearing only one shoe – or only socks. In one case, the belongings of a youthful hunter were discovered on a boulder in the middle of a creek. His backpack had been opened and emptied, the contents stacked neatly on the rock. The hunter was never found.

In a particularly grisly case, a search and rescue team climbed up over a large fallen tree only to discover the gruesome remains of the missing young man: the only thing left of him were his feet and legs up to the shins. His boots were gone, but socks still on. His trousers had dropped down around his ankles. Tiny bone fragments littered the immediate area. The searchers were freaked out and the story died a natural death, unlike the unfortunate park visitor.

While these cases are both morbid and disturbing, the real mystery here is why Paulides and other legitimate, conscientious investigators are getting stone-walled by the National Park Service.

Is the bottom line here which explains the uncooperative NPS the “real” bottom line: park visitor revenue?

 Paulides himself has reached no conclusion. However, he and his organization continue to find the solution to this puzzling situation.",conspiracy
113,"The Indian army has claimed to have found footprints of the yeti, sparking jokes and disbelief on social media.

The army tweeted to its nearly six million followers on Monday that it had discovered ""mysterious footprints of mythical beast 'Yeti' at the Makalu Base Camp [in the Himalayas]"".

The yeti - a giant ape-like creature - often figures in South Asian folklore.

There is no evidence proving yeti exist but the myth retains a strong appeal in the region.
• Why don't people see the yeti any more?

And the army has now added to the legend by sharing pictures of ""footprints"" in the snow on an official Twitter account.

Although the footprints were discovered on 9 April, the army made the discovery public only after deciding that it matched earlier theories about the yeti, according to a report in the Times of India.

Reacting to the disbelief on social media, the army said the ""evidence"" about the yeti had been ""photographed "" and ""handed over to subject matter experts"".

""So, we thought it prudent [to go public] to excite scientific temper and rekindle the interest.""

The yeti, also known as the Abominable Snowman, is a legendary creature that is said to inhabit the upper reaches of the Himalayas. Stories of people seeing the yeti or its footprints are common in parts of India, Nepal and Bhutan.

In 2013, research by a British scientist concluded that the legendary Himalayan yeti may in fact be a sub-species of brown bear.

Twitter users reacted with disbelief that the Indian army would make such a bold claim about the footprints of a ""mythical beast"".

The claim also inspired humour in good measure.

There have been numerous attempts in recent years to solve the mystery of the yeti.

In 2011, DNA tests on a ""yeti finger"" taken from Nepal to London half a century ago found it to be human bone.

And in 2013, DNA tests on hair samples carried out by Oxford University genetics professor Bryan Sykes found that they matched those from an ancient polar bear. He said the most likely explanation for the myth is that the animal is a hybrid of polar bears and brown bears.",mainstream

510,"Some people believe in Bigfoot. Most don't. Some aren't sure what might be tramping around California's backcountry.

Margaret Wooden is skeptical but she knows one thing: Bigfoot could be good for business.

""He's quite a drawing card,"" says Wooden, who helped organize the Willow Creek-China Flat Museum's new Bigfoot Wing.

The idea: Put some local history on display and see whether this struggling former lumber town can jump-start its economy with a big hand from Bigfoot.

""It was a natural,"" says Jo Ann Hereford, another in the squadron of volunteers who keep the museum going.

Bigfoot? Like the Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas, Bigfoot -- often called Sasquatch -- is an apelike creature 6 feet to 10 feet tall that numbers of people claim to have spotted roaming the backcountry of the Pacific Northwest. The existence of the critter has never been proved to the satisfaction of scientists. Neither has it been disproved.

Bigfoot goes back a long way in Willow Creek, an old Gold Rush town about 300 miles north of San Francisco. Tracks were reported in 1958 at Bluff Creek, a remote spot about 50 miles north.

Newspapers quickly took up the story. ""Huge Foot Prints Hold Mystery of Friendly Bluff Creek Giant,"" reads one headline preserved in the Willow Creek exhibit.

He was running a general store in Willow Creek when a reporter for a local paper talked him into giving her a ride up to remote Bluff Creek.

Soon, he was making regular trips into the woods, plaster of Paris at the ready.

Hodgson never found Bigfoot, although he did make casts of some footprints.

But he was there the night in 1967 that Bigfoot hunter Roger Patterson came into town saying he'd just captured his elusive quarry on film. The much-debated grainy footage shows a shaggy ape-like creature walking upright.

""I really personally think he absolutely did see Bigfoot,"" says Hodgson. ""I've had my doubts at times, but I just don't see anything else really. I just don't think he faked it.""

If the scientific community hasn't exactly embraced the concept of Bigfoot, that hasn't quenched amateur enthusiasm. Sightings have been reported all over; the Pacific Northwest is a favorite.

This month, explorer J. Richard Greenwell will lead his fourth annual Bigfoot expedition into the forests of Northern California. Greenwell is a research associate with the International Wildlife Museum and secretary of the Tucson-based International Society of Cryptozoology, dedicated to the scientific evaluation of evidence of ""unverified animals.""

His first and third trips turned up some strange prints, weird howls and mysterious nighttime visitors who sneaked food; the second year's outing was a month of ""absolutely nothing.""

""A lot of scientists think the thing cannot exist, it's impossible, so why waste time even testing the hypothesis,"" Greenwell says. ""In real science you start off with, `Let's examine the evidence.' If you start off by saying it's impossible, then what you're doing is you're taking the shortcut.""

Greenwell thinks the Willow Creek exhibit is ""fairly well done. It's not like the Smithsonian, of course, but for the resources they had I think they put a lot of thought into it.""

The bulk of the memorabilia was willed to the museum by Bigfoot enthusiast Bob Titmus, on condition it be put in a worthy setting.",mainstream
61,"Before I update you on the coronavirus outbreak, I’d like to start with a few words about Ebola.

Although the world is now focused on coronavirus, we cannot and must not forget Ebola.

We are very encouraged by the current trend. There have only been 3 cases in the past week, and no cases in the past 3 days.

But until we have no cases for 42 days, it's not over. As you know, any single case could re-ignite the epidemic, and the security situation in eastern DRC remains extremely fragile. So we take the progress on Ebola with caution, although it’s a big success.

We are still in full response mode. Yesterday alone, 5400 alerts were investigated, almost 300 samples were analyzed, more than 700 people were vaccinated and almost 2000 contacts were followed. So still it’s a massive response.

Tomorrow, the Emergency Committee for Ebola will meet to assess whether the Ebola outbreak in DRC continues to constitute a public health emergency of international concern. So you will have more news tomorrow on Ebola.

Regardless of their recommendation, the world needs to continue to fund the Ebola response. Taking our foot off the accelerator now could be a fatal mistake – quite literally.

On Thursday I will travel to Kinshasa for meetings with the President of DRC and other senior ministers to look beyond Ebola, and sketch out ways to strengthen DRC’s health system.

And I would like to use this opportunity to appreciate the government’s leadership. The current status of Ebola would not have been reached without the leadership of President Tshisekedi and the government.

First of all, we now have a name for the disease:

COVID-19. I’ll spell it: C-O-V-I-D hyphen one nine – COVID-19.

Under agreed guidelines between WHO, the World Organisation for Animal Health and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, we had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual or group of people, and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease.

Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing. It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks.

Now to the coronavirus situation.

As of 6am Geneva time this morning, there were 42,708 confirmed cases reported in China, and tragically we have now surpassed 1000 deaths - 1017 people in China have lost their lives to this virus. Most of the cases and most of the deaths are in Hubei province, Wuhan.

Outside China, there are 393 cases in 24 countries, and 1 death.

Last week I told you that we had engaged WHO’s network of country representatives, as well as the United Nations resident coordinators in countries, to brief them on the outbreak and inform them about the steps they can take.

I also briefed Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, and we agreed to leverage the power of the entire UN system in the response.

Today we have also activated a UN Crisis Management Team, to be led by my general, Dr Mike Ryan. This will help WHO focus on the health response while the other agencies can bring their expertise to bear on the wider social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak so we are all working to our strengths.

So Mike will continue to be the chief and will also coordinate the whole UN response.

As you know, today and tomorrow WHO is hosting a meeting of more than 400 scientists from around the world, both in person and virtually.

The main outcome we expect from this meeting is not immediate answers to every question that we have.

The main outcome is an agreed roadmap on what questions we need to ask, and how we will go about answering those questions.

This is exactly what WHO is for – bringing the world together to coordinate the response. That’s the essence of multilateralism, which is very important for the world.

A research roadmap is also important for organizations that fund research to have a clear sense of what the public health priorities are, so they can make investments that deliver the biggest public health impact.

The development of vaccines and therapeutics is one important part of the research agenda – but it is only one part. They will take time to develop, but in the meantime, we are not defenceless. There are many basic public health interventions that are available to us now, and which can prevent infections now.

The first vaccine could be ready in 18 months, so we have to do everything today using the available weapons to fight this virus, while preparing for the long-term.

We’ve sent supplies to countries to diagnose and treat patients and protect health workers.

We’ve advised countries on how to prevent the spread of disease and care for those who are sick.

We’re strengthening lab capacity all over the world.

And we’re keeping the public informed about what everyone can do to protect their own health and that of others.

It’s when each and every individual becomes part of the containment strategy that we can succeed. That’s why reaching out to the public directly and telling them the precautions they should take.

Clean your hands regularly, either with alcohol-based rub or soap and water.

Keep your distance from someone who is coughing or sneezing.

And when you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow.

It’s also important to remember that while we need investment in research and development, we also need investment in stopping this outbreak now.

Last week, WHO issued a call for $675 million, which is what the world needs to support preparedness and response operations in countries.

We thank those countries that have contributed so far, and we call on all those who haven’t to contribute urgently.

There are many positive signals in terms of funding, and we hope that all these signals will materialize.

If we invest now in rational and evidence-based interventions, we have a realistic chance of stopping this outbreak.

Maybe you’re tired of me saying window of opportunity, but there is a window of opportunity.

You strike hard when the window of opportunity is there. That’s what we’re saying to the rest of the world. Let’s be serious in using the window of opportunity we have.

The opportunity was created because of the serious measures China is taken in Wuhan and other cities.

But I don’t think this status can stay the same for long. That’s why we have to use the window of opportunity.

If we don’t, we could have far more cases – and far higher costs – on our hands.

I don’t think anybody wants that. This is a common enemy.",mainstream
1185,"Aberdeen-based Wood Group has won a multi-million dollar contract to build an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico.

The energy services company was awarded a three-year contract by Chevron Corporation to commission its Big Foot extended tension leg platform (ETLP).

Work will be performed by Wood Group subsidiary Deepwater Specialists Inc (DSI).

Chevron said it could rely on DSI to provide ""safe and consistent"" commissioning services.

A tension leg platform is a vertically moored floating structure for use in a wide range of water depths.

DSI will run the full commissioning process, from inspection and testing of operational components at South Texas fabrication yards and offshore, to the final handover of systems to Chevron.

Big Foot is the eighth tension leg platform DSI has commissioned worldwide.

It is the fifth commissioned for Chevron, including the Jack and St Malo semi-submersible platform in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

Big Foot will be located in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, approximately 225 miles (360km) south of New Orleans, Louisiana, in water depths of 5,200ft (1,600m).

The development will have production capacity of 75,000 barrels of oil and 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Its first oil is anticipated in 2014.

Recently, Wood Group subsidiary Alliance Engineering was awarded a multi-million contract to provide detailed engineering and design services for the Tamar gas platform project to be located offshore in the eastern Mediterranean's Levantine Basin.",mainstream
594,"I have predicted many developments in Fortnite over the last year or so, and I have been wrong many, many times. This is not one of those times.

Last week, I predicted that the new changes to Pressure Plant were because the area was gearing up to build a giant mech to take on the monster roaming around the map with Polar Peak on its head. The staging of the area, the reveal of skins like Rox and Singularity dressed as mecha-style pilots, all of it seemed to point to this idea, even though nothing was in the game to confirm it.

And this week, I’ve been proven correct thanks to some datamining. The regular crew of miners has extracted one piece of what is very clearly a giant robot, its foot.

The foot, and only the foot, has been found, meaning that it seems likely that the robot will be built in stages over the course of the final few weeks of the season before a major showdown to close out season 9.

The foot is absolutely massive, and you can see the scale of it in the image above, or in the image below in terms of how it compares to Polar Peak.

And yet curiously, the foot is still not as big as the monster’s footprint, when you compare those side by side, so it’s clearly going to be a tough battle.

So how…will this battle play out? There are a range of theories from an LTM that has players helping the monster or the robot, or this might just be one of those cinematic events that the game just has you sit and watch as a one-time only spectacle.

My theory is that the robot and monster fight will mostly play out cinematically, destroying certain areas of the map to be rebuilt this season, and as such, this will probably be Fortnite’s most involved special event ever. I also believe that players will be asked to join in and help fight the monster, as Fortnite has been experimenting with platform-wide HP pools in the billions and trillions, and that all has seemed like it’s leading up to everyone in the game shooting at a monster with 100 trillion HP or something as we try to aid our robot friend in defeating it. That’s my guess, anyway, and it will not be something to be missed.

I would expect the foot or feet of the robot to show up with the next patch this week. After that, we’ll see how quickly this thing gets built, and what else the monster destroys before then.

568,"Agonies of the feet: Four common foot problems

They develop when the joint formed by the metatarsal and proximal phalanx bones of the big toe fall out of their normal, relatively straight alignment and angle out, creating an outward bulge at the base of the big toe. The bursa that cushions the joint may also get inflamed and enlarge. Often the end of the metatarsal bone becomes larger and misshapen.

Causes. Some people have a natural tendency to develop bunions because the big toe's metatarsal bone is splayed out to begin with. Wear-and-tear and being overweight can splay it out even further. Lack of an arch and overpronation (walking on the inside of your foot) put more weight on the big toe and its metatarsal-phalangeal joint. Jamming feet into narrow shoes puts backward pressure on the big toe, so it buckles out, forming a bunion.

980,"The drive to the little white dome on the northern slope of Mauna Loa is a bumpy one. Mauna Loa, the “Long Mountain,” is a colossal volcano that covers half of the island of Hawaii. The rocky terrain, rusty brown and deep red, crunches beneath car tires and jostles passengers. Up there, more than 8,000 feet above sea level and many miles away from the sounds of civilization, it doesn’t feel like Earth. It feels like another planet. Like Mars. For the past five years, small groups of people have made this drive and moved into the dome, known as a habitat. Their job is to pretend that they really are on Mars, and then spend months living like it. The goal, for the researchers who send them there, is to figure out how human beings would do on a mission to the real thing. In February of this year, the latest batch of pioneers, a crew of four, made the journey up the mountain. They settled in for an eight-month stay. Four days later, one of them was taken away on a stretcher and hospitalized.

The remaining crew members were evacuated by mission support. All four eventually returned to the habitat, not to continue their mission, but to pack up their stuff. Their simulation was over for good. The little white dome has remained empty since, and the University of Hawaii, which runs the program, and NASA, which funds it, are investigating the incident that derailed the mission. The mission that began in February was the sixth iteration of the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation, or HI-SEAS. The durations have varied, from four months to a full year, and participants come from all over the world and different fields. HI-SEAS is a social experiment, and the participants are the lab rats. They wear devices to track their vitals, movements, and sleep, answer countless questionnaires about their own behavior and their interactions with others, and journal several times a week about their feelings. Psychology researchers take all that data and use them to tease out information about what works and what doesn’t when you stick people in a tiny space they can’t escape. (Hint: They get on each other’s nerves—a lot—as documented in a recent podcast series, The Habitat. There’s also a little romance.) Meanwhile, the crew members live as much as possible like they are on Mars. They eat freeze-dried food, use a composting toilet, take 30-second showers to conserve water, and never step outside without a space suit and helmet. They don’t communicate with anyone in real time, not even family. An email to mission support or their loved ones takes 20 minutes to get there. Receiving a response takes another 20 minutes. They’re not allowed to see anyone outside of the mission. “The kinds of things that you can hurt yourself doing at home are also the kinds of things that you can hurt yourself doing at the hab.” The habitat is a tight squeeze. The ground floor, which includes a kitchen, bathroom, a lab, and exercise spaces, measures 993 square feet. The second floor, where the bedrooms are, spans 424 square feet.

“You really do get the sense, when you’re going to sleep and you’re closing your eyes at night, that this could be a distant planet,” says Ross Lockwood, a physicist from Edmonton, Canada, and one of the members of mission two. “This could be Mars.” But sometimes, Earth finds a way of sneaking in, of breaking the fuzzy boundary between simulation and reality. Mission six arrived at the habitat on February 15. The crew waved goodbye to the researchers gathered outside the dome, felt the breeze on their faces for the last time for a long time, and piled in. The doors closed. Michaela Musilova, one of the crew members, described their first moments in an interview in April with The Cosmic Shed, a science podcast. (Musilova declined an interview with The Atlantic.)
• The Asteroid Mission That Never Leaves Earth
• Will Living on Mars Drive Us Crazy? “Our commander cited part of [the 2011 novel] The Martian. I think it was the very first line of The Martian, like, ‘Oh, we’re fucked now,’ or something along those lines,” recalled Musilova, an astrobiologist from Slovakia. “And so we just gave each other a big hug and like, ‘Okay, we can do this.’” The first few days were cloudy, which can be a problem on the volcano. The habitat and its systems run on a battery bank that is charged each day through a large solar array on the grounds. On cloudy or rainy days, it can be difficult for the batteries to bounce back. When this happens, the crew is supposed to suit up, go outside, and turn on a car-size backup generator that runs on propane.

“We really make it as primitive as some farm in Vermont,” said Bill Wiecking, the HI-SEAS tech-support lead and the energy-lab director at the Hawaii Preparatory Academy. Mission support receives text-message alerts when the habitat’s life-sustaining systems reach dangerous levels, but for the most part, it’s up to the crew to manage their use. As stubborn clouds hung over the habitat, the crew tried to minimize their energy use. They dimmed most of the lights, kept kitchen appliances unplugged, and stayed off the treadmill. On the morning of February 19, Lisa Stojanovski, a science communicator from Australia, woke up to find that the power in the habitat had gone out. “We must have used too much power, I guess,” she told me. Stojanovski and another crew member initiated the procedures for leaving the habitat. They shimmied into their space suits, stepped outside, and headed for the backup propane generator, located nearby on the grounds. Stojanovski and her partner would flip a switch to bring the generator to life, while the two other crew members would flip a switch on a circuit breaker inside the habitat. This maneuver would shift the power source from the dead batteries over to the generator, Stojanovski said. When it was done, Stojanovski came back inside. “I was elated that we were on track to solve the problem, and I was pretty bouncy and excited,” she said. “It was a little jarring at first, when the two crew members who were inside didn’t quite share the excitement. That was my first gut feeling that something was not quite right.”

One of the crew members was typing furiously at a computer. The other looked stricken, pale. They said they didn’t feel well. They said they had sustained an electric shock. Nothing like this had ever happened before inside the habitat. Kim Binsted, the HI-SEAS principal investigator and a professor at the University of Hawaii, told me that injuries during previous missions ranged from bruises and scrapes, acquired during treks across the rocky landscape, to “household accidents.” “The kinds of things that you can hurt yourself doing at home are also the kinds of things that you can hurt yourself doing at the hab,” Binsted said. “I have never thought ... that maintaining the simulation is more important than the safety of the crew.” Stojanovski said she suspects the electric shock may have occurred because the crew member’s fingers brushed against live wiring. “In a regular household circuit breaker, you have a safety panel that covers all the live wiring that’s behind the switches,” Stojanovski said. “Unfortunately, our circuit breaker didn’t have one of those.” The injured crew member was shivering. They lay down on the floor. The others covered them in blankets. The crew placed several calls to the mission’s on-call doctor on an emergency cellphone in the habitat, which works in real time, but there was no answer. The person designated as the crew commander then called 911 on the emergency line. The crew wasn’t supposed to have contact with people outside of the habitat. If first responders came to the dome, the simulation would be compromised. Stojanovski said the commander told her he wasn’t calling to summon an ambulance, but only to ask for medical advice. This took her aback. Stojanovski believed they needed an ambulance, and they needed it now.

The crew commander, Sukjin Han, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Texas at Austin from South Korea, told me he signed off on most of the important decisions during the mission, but that he made sure to “hear the thoughts and opinions of all crew members beforehand and reflect them in the decisions.” In the tense moments after the accident, Han went with the majority. “The majority of the members—including the member who experienced the incident—decided that we [wanted] to ask for medical advice from 911, before asking for an ambulance. I don’t remember if Lisa had the same opinion but I do remember that she never objected to the plan,” Han said. “I have never thought and don’t think that maintaining the simulation is more important than the safety of the crew.” During their training, HI-SEAS crew are told often that their well-being comes first. Safety is paramount. But so is maintaining the simulation. No one involved in HI-SEAS wants to jeopardize the data by breaking the sim, as they sometimes call it. They don’t want to give up before it’s over, either. Leaving the habitat would mean throwing away hours and hours of physical, social, and emotional investment. For participants who came from outside of the United States, it even means visa troubles. “We all left our regular lives, quit our jobs in some cases, left our loved ones to go spend eight months doing this,” said Laura Lark, a software developer in New York who participated in mission five. “So we’re all pretty committed to getting high-quality data out of it.”

The thought of abandoning the simulation becomes more painful the longer the mission goes on. The crew members of mission six were faced with this dilemma just four days in. What if it were four months? In one of the early missions, a crew member unwittingly turned on an internet access point that interfered with the HI-SEAS network, causing a communications blackout between the mountain and mission support. Wiecking had to go up the mountain to fix it, a move that could have jeopardized the integrity of the crew’s isolation. As Wiecking fiddled quietly with hardware a few feet from the dome, he could hear the voices of the crew through the tentlike walls. “That was so close to breaking the simulation, we had to have a big review over it,” he said. During Lockwood’s mission, the second mission of the HI-SEAS project, a crew member decided to withdraw because of a chronic medical issue. “We struggled with the idea of what we would do if we really were on Mars,” Lockwood said. They decided to pretend that the crew member died. They imagined that they would leave his corpse out in the Martian atmosphere, where it would not decompose as it would on Earth, in the hopes of bringing it back to Earth for burial. And they actually acted this all out. Lockwood said they had the departing crew member step into the vestibule that separates the habitat from the outside, the simulated “airlock.” The person stood there for five minutes, as they all would do before doing an extravehicular activity (EVA), and waited, pretending the airlock was depressurizing, evening out the pressure inside and outside, so they could safely exit. Then the crew member opened the door and walked outside, where mission support staff picked them up and took them down the mountain. “I’m not okay with this. I’m not okay with the culture and the attitude toward safety.” This time, in mission six, the danger was real. As the crew tried to figure out what to do, Stojanovski started to get worried about the injured crew member. “They were going downhill,” she said. “They had a tight chest and some pain behind the shoulder blades. I’m not a doctor or anything like that, but those kinds of symptoms freaked me out a little bit. I was pretty worried that they were going to have a heart attack or something.” The crew had received first-aid training, but the situation seemed to require more than that. She called Binsted, the HI-SEAS principal investigator, and told her what happened. No one could reach the on-call doctor. Stojanovski said Binsted told the crew to call 911 again. This time, they asked for an ambulance.

“Throughout all our training, we’d been told, ‘Don’t worry, emergency services knows where you are, they know who you are, and they know how to get to you,’” Stojanovski said. “I was like, ‘My name’s Lisa, I’m from the HI-SEAS project, we would like an ambulance please, this is where we are.’ And they were like, ‘You’re from what project? Where are you located?’” Stojanovski’s call to 911 had been picked up by Hawaii County dispatchers, but help would arrive from elsewhere. The Pohakuloa Training Area is a U.S. Army base of several hundred people, located less than 15 miles from the habitat. Its jurisdiction stretches from Mauna Loa to Mauna Kea—and the HI-SEAS habitat sits nearly in the middle. Like the habitat, Pohakuloa is isolated from the rest of the world. The remoteness requires the military base to operate like a city, complete with a fire department and EMTs. “We got the call that morning that there was a potential electrocution, that the individual was awake and conscious, but [they were] breathing heavily and [they] needed to be checked out,” said Eric Moller, the fire chief of the Pohakuloa Training Area, about the call from Hawaii County. “They were afraid about hypertension, elevated blood pressure.” The Army base dispatched an ambulance carrying four responders. On a clear day, the drive from the base to the habitat takes 35 to 45 minutes. According to a response report from Pohakuloa obtained by The Atlantic, the drive took 43 minutes on February 19. Inside the habitat, the minutes seemed to drag like hours. At one point, Stojanovski said one of the responders called the habitat to say they were lost.

Moller said Pohakuloa’s fire captain phoned the habitat because responders were concerned about the conditions of the roads, which are unpaved, but they weren’t lost. When they reached a gate along the route to the habitat, they found that the lock was jammed. This added to their response time. “Our guys go up and down that mountain all the time,” says Gregory Fleming, Pohakuloa’s deputy garrison commander, often to rescue lost hikers in flip-flops. And military staff know not to disturb their neighbors, the fake astronauts. They have been advised that any interaction risks wrecking their delicate reality. When the crew finally heard tires grinding over rock outside, Stojanovski turned toward the exit, ready to greet the first responders. Han stopped her, she said, warning that whatever happened next would break the simulation. “I actually lost my temper at this point,” Stojanovski said. “I don’t remember exactly what I said, but there were some curse words involved.” Han said he remembers Stojanovski moving quickly to the door. “I correctly remember that at least two of the members, including myself, called her name, almost simultaneously,” he said. “At least for myself, it was partly in order to calm her down, because she has suddenly become very emotional at that very moment, and give [her] at least one second to think about her reaction.” “We’ve learned all the ways that you can kill yourself on Mars.” Stojanovski could have ignored the others. HI-SEAS participants receive specific roles, like commander or communications specialist or health officer, but compliance is not compulsory as it would be, for example, in a military mission. “They have to fulfill those roles, but ultimately as they come together as a team, that’s something the crew have to figure out on their own,” said Joseph Gruber, the mission-support coordinator for HI-SEAS, and one of the people who regularly communicates with crews over email. “There’s structures in place and we give them guidelines on how best to do this, but it’s up to them. They’re the ones up there.” Stojanovski decided to heed Han’s request. She didn’t go outside.

Stojanovski opened the door and waved the first responders into habitat. They loaded the injured crew member into the ambulance and checked their vitals. The ambulance drove down the volcano as far it could go; after about 20 miles, the vehicle neared the edge of Pohakuloa’s jurisdiction, a line the first responders aren’t allowed to cross. If they travel beyond this region, the reasoning goes, they leave the Pohakuloa residents at risk. A hospital ambulance met the Pohakuloa ambulance at this edge, grabbed the crew member, and sped toward Hilo Medical Center, about 30 miles east of the habitat. “It was really surreal when the ambulance drove away and there was kind of just silence,” Stojanovski recalls. “Like, wow, what just happened?” Back at their training base, a house in Kona, Stojanovski compiled a list of safety concerns about the habitat and sent it to Binsted, who confirmed she received it. Binsted wanted to continue the mission after getting approval from the university and NASA. Stojanovski said she did too, but only after mission support addressed her concerns and implemented some fixes. Stojanovski sought some reassurance, but Binsted couldn’t make any guarantees, at least not before an investigation. “I kind of sat there and thought, You know what? I’m not okay with this,” Stojanovski said. “I’m not okay with the culture and the attitude toward safety.” Now that she was off the mountain and out of the bubble, her perception of the mission changed. She decided to withdraw from it altogether.

Every HI-SEAS mission since the first one in 2013 has had a crew of six. Mission six started out that way, too, but two people were removed from the program, one of them just days before she said she was scheduled to fly from Australia to Hawaii. Binsted said she couldn’t comment on why mission six went ahead with four. The staff say the habitat is a safe environment. Brian Shiro, a geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, who has worked on HI-SEAS since its inception, said staff deliberated about whether to move forward with a smaller crew. “At any point along this timeline, there could have been a hard decision to delay the mission or cancel, but that’s not what they decided,” Shiro said. “I was on the side of the fence to delay. I didn’t want to start this mission because of the crew size. I said, ‘Guys, let’s find more people, let’s wait a few months at least.’ But I was overruled.” He added: “This crew was very, very impressive, very professional, very motivated. But there were only four of them, and that left them vulnerable.” During a real Mars mission, crew members will face a panoply of risks. People can, and probably will, get injured. They may die. Simulations like HI-SEAS attempt to forecast reactions to some of these threats, ranging from the things we cannot control, like the poisonous air outside, to those that we can only intuit, like the ideal way to organize a crew.

“We have things that we know we don’t know,” said Jenn Fogarty, the chief scientist at NASA’s Human Research Program, the office that provides financial grants to HI-SEAS. “The ‘I don’t know what I don’t know’ is the scary space.” Long before we send the first humans to Mars and keep them happy and healthy, we’ll have to figure out how to do that here—and it starts with deciding who should be on the mountain, which isn’t easy. “You can select a crew all you want, get the right fit and mix, but there’s too many variables when it comes to human beings,” said Raphael Rose, the associate director of the Anxiety and Depression Research Center at UCLA, who was set to study stress management and resilience on mission six. “It’s just really hard to predict how we’re going to perform in all situations.” Mission six arrived on Mauna Loa after the customary, rigorous application process that requires written essays, reference checks, Skype interviews, and, perhaps most important, the same kind of psychological screenings that NASA gives its astronauts. With each iteration of HI-SEAS, researchers and mission personnel learn a bit more about crew composition and what types of people work well together. Steve Kozlowski, an organizational psychologist at Michigan State University who studies team effectiveness, said HI-SEAS finalists are scored on five personality traits, known in the field as the Big Five: extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience. Kozlowski said they want conscientious people, but up to a point. Conscientiousness can veer toward passivity. Some degree of extroversion is valuable, until it’s too much. Outgoing people can morph into domineering people. In other words, it’s all about balance.

Psychological screenings can only predict so much. “Sometimes people look really good on paper and they might even interview well, but if there’s a big red flag on that screening, it gives one pause,” Shiro said. “There’ve been people we’ve ruled out because of that.” During the mission, crews make regular trips outside of the habitat to explore the volcanic terrain in their space suits. To prepare them for this EVA, Shiro leads participants on excursions across the rugged landscape soon after they arrive in Hawaii. “Three days in the field in those conditions is a good way to get to know people,” he said. “There’s people that I think, Eh, I wonder how that one’s gonna do. Usually, that gut feeling, there’s something to it.” A real mission to Mars would likely require crews to train together for months, maybe even years—far longer than the nine days of training that mission six had, Shiro said. Crew members would be put through a multitude of stressful situations to test their reactions. “You would tease out any red flags before you even left Earth,” Shiro said. Shiro said one of his gut feelings kicked in during the fieldwork training for mission six. “There was this one person who was not as comfortable in the field,” he said. “That’s the sort of thing you don’t know until you get out there. Still did it, did all the training—a little slower, but did it all. But when the incident happened that ultimately led to the cancelation of the mission, that’s the person who quit. And it was not a surprise to any of us because we said, ‘Yeah, you know, she was a little more timid out there.’” “When you’re signing up for a Mars mission, you know that you’re giving yourself away in almost every aspect of your life.” Stojanovski rebuffed Shiro’s assessment of her training. “I actually enjoyed being out in the field,” she said. “In fact, I was the first to volunteer to go outside on an emergency space walk on the morning of the incident.”

The HI-SEAS staff say the habitat is a safe environment. “We’ve learned all the ways that you can kill yourself on Mars, and we’ve learned to prevent those things,” Wiecking said. “So it’s been very, very valuable, because it’s way better to do it here, where you can drive up and go, ‘Oh gosh, a water valve opened up and now you don’t have any water.’ Instead of on Mars, where it’s like, ‘You don’t have any water, you guys are gonna die in a couple of days.’” Round-trip communication between Earth and Mars will take about 40 minutes. Astronauts won’t have the luxury of sitting around and waiting for commands or approval from Earth. HI-SEAS has mission support, rather than mission control, for that reason. The first astronauts on Mars will choose for themselves, for the most part, how they will live and work. In case of an emergency, they will need to decide what to do. And there’s no guarantee the astronauts won’t choose to take matters into their own hands. “That’s the complexity of humans. They are going to do things on their own, maybe outside of the mission rules. They are going to try to make things work on their own, and they’re inventive and smart, and that’s the reason you picked this crew,” Fogarty said. “So thinking you can keep them in this tight little box of emotions is unrealistic.” The potential cracks in the relationship between crew and mission support are already showing. Last year, when Hurricane Harvey struck Texas and forced the displacement of thousands, NASA staff decided to evacuate the members of a space simulation in Houston. For several weeks, a crew of four lives and works inside a cozy fake spaceship at the Johnson Space Center, pretending they’re coasting toward an asteroid.

“When we woke them up that Sunday morning and told them to pack up, that we were terminating the mission, they were not happy with us,” said Lisa Spence, the flight-analog project manager for the program, known as the Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA). “One of them was pretty upset and not very complimentary and [asked us], ‘Why are you doing this? There’s no problem here, we want to continue.’ It wasn’t until the vehicle came and evacuated them and took them to the hotel, and they could see cars stranded all over the place, and boats that had been washed up onto the streets, and several feet of water across the roads—then they kind of appreciated why we stopped.” The mission support at HERA had better information than the crew did, and because they sit in the same warehouse, just 20 feet away from the “spaceship,” they could make a decision for the crew. That won’t be possible on Mars. If the crew goes rogue, the people back on Earth might have no idea. Some degree of eavesdropping on the crew might be necessary, according to Sonja Schmer-Galunder, a researcher at Smart Information Flow Technologies, whose work on HI-SEAS was aimed at developing ways to predict the behavioral health of individuals and the team. “I’m not the person to decide where the limits of their privacy are, and clearly you have to be able to withdraw and also have your private space. Is it ethical?” Schmer-Galunder said. “I mean, if people are signing up to go to Mars, I think everything should and must be done in order to bring the crew back safe. When you’re signing up for a Mars mission, you know that you’re giving yourself away in almost every aspect of your life. You become a tool that is being sent out there.”

The HI-SEAS program is now on hold until the University of Hawaii and NASA complete their separate reviews. Fogarty, of NASA’s Human Research Program, is supportive of Binsted and the project. Fogarty said it’s possible that the university and the space agency could come to different conclusions about the incident, which could determine the future of the HI-SEAS project. “In the future, NASA may not participate in it if we don’t feel that our safety threshold for participants is met,” Fogarty said. HI-SEAS, which is run mostly by volunteers, could continue on its own. But NASA’s withdrawal would be detrimental to the agency, which doesn’t have any similar Mars simulations. The longest run of HERA, the asteroid analog, was just 45 days. “When people do eventually get to Mars and they have a situation like this … you’re increasing their chances of surviving.” Stojanovski returned to Australia soon after the mission ended. She had resigned from a job on the communications team at Rocket Lab, a U.S. spaceflight company with a subsidiary based in New Zealand, after finding out she had been selected for the HI-SEAS program. When she withdrew from the mission, the job had already been filled. She worked at a fish market for a few months when she came home. She recently found another role at Rocket Lab, as an executive assistant, and moved to Auckland in May. According to their personal websites, Musilova and Hervieu have found work at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, located near the summit of Mauna Kea, less than 40 miles north of the habitat. “I’ve been saying c’est la vie quite a lot recently, and that’s really how it is,” Musilova said in the Cosmic Shed interview. “Life happens.” Han is still listed as a professor at the University of Texas at Austin.

Stojanovski has stayed in some touch with Binsted and Musilova. She hasn’t spoken with Hervieu or Han. Several months removed from that February morning, Stojanovski said she wishes her crew’s panicked discussions had gone differently. “I really regret that I followed orders that were not in the spirit of crew health and safety, just for the sake of keeping the mission within the simulation,” she said. I asked Stojanovski whether she regrets withdrawing from the mission. She said it was a hard decision. But no, she doesn’t. “In a way, I am kind of glad that this happened, because it’s been able to be a learning opportunity that exposes all the weak points in the system,” she said. “We can make the system strong so that people, when they do eventually get to Mars and they have a situation like this, they can be in a better position to tackle it. You’re increasing their chances of surviving something like this.” Stojanovski remembers fondly the few days her crew had on the volcano, before Earth came knocking on their door. It was cozy in that little white dome. One crew member had brought ping-pong paddles, so they cleared a table and started bouncing the ball back and forth, click, clack. Another came with an electronic keyboard and played classical compositions at night. Distinctly earthly noises in a place that felt anything like home. They wafted around the habitat, pierced its thin walls, and drifted out into the silent expanse.",mainstream
623,"A North Carolina man from Boone vacationing near Asheville who claims he saw Bigfoot got a big assist from his little dog while capturing video of Sasquatch crossing the road in Henderson County.

Eric Walters wasn't the only one to see the Missing Link - his brown Yorkshire Terrier Zippy did too.

Walters was taking Zippy for a walk on Thursday morning when they spotted 'Bigfoot' walking near some brush on the side of a dirt road, according to the Citizen-Times.

He said: 'Either there's a Sasquatch out there or someone is trying to play a practical joke.'

The large figure captured on the cellphone video shot by Walters can be seen walking into the bushes without acknowledging the camera or Zippy's barking.

People had warned Walters about a bear in the area so he was keeping Zippy extra close when the little brown dog spotted the creature and took off, ABC11 reported.

Walters said: 'Zippy could tell I was scared and got so riled up that he got loose and went after it.

'It turns out the brave little guy chased the Sasquatch away and saved me from a possible encounter.

'I love him more than ever.'

This is not the first time there has been a Bigfoot sighting in the Tar Heel State.

In 2011, Thomas Byers of Shelby shot video of a Sasquatch crossing the road in Rutherford County about 300 miles away from where Walters spotted his Bigfoot.

Byers saw the seven-foot-tall creature leave a field and cross in front of his truck, ABC reported.

He said: 'It was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen.'",mainstream
15,"(CNN) A couple camping at a national park in Kentucky said they were rousted from their tent by a man who told them he had seen a Bigfoot.

The man said he fired into the darkness after the ape-like monster that has never been proven to exist lunged at him, the couple told CNN on Wednesday.

Law enforcement rangers with the Mammoth Cave National Park r esponded to the incident involving the camper with the firearm at one of the park's backcountry campsites early Sunday, park spokeswoman Molly Schroer said in a statement.

The statement did not confirm a Bigfoot sighting but Schroer said no threat remains in the park.

Federal regulations prohibit the discharge of a firearm in the national park, she said. Park officials know the identity of the person who allegedly fired a weapon; no charges have been filed.

""I was mostly just concerned about him shooting the gun in the middle of the night without him really seeing anything,"" said Durand, 22.

Durand said she was awakened around 11 p.m. when she heard noises outside their tent. She assumed other campers were being rowdy and drinking. She woke Ginn after a flashlight shined into the tent.

""We got out of the tent and saw a man who told us their campsite had been destroyed by someone or something,"" said Durand, a student at Western Kentucky University.

The man, who was with his young son, showed them his gun on his hip and told them the area was popular for Bigfoot sightings, Durand recalled. The couple climbed back into their tent as the man walked away to investigate with his son in tow.

""We heard them coming back about 10 minutes later. We heard them yelling 'I see it!' Durand said.

She added: ""We saw the flash from his gun, and he shot maybe 20 yards from the side of our tent into the pitch-black darkness.""

Durand said she was scared that the gunfire could have struck them.

The man with firearm seemed frightened, too. He told the couple his hands were shaking, they recalled.

""The guy said he saw a Bigfoot emerge from the brush and it was coming towards him, so he shot at it,"" said Ginn, 24, who also attends Western Kentucky University.

""We shined a flashlight to see if there was an animal or something. And there was absolutely nothing there,"" Durand said.

Once the adrenalin wore off, the couple made jokes about their strange night during their 5-mile hike to back their car in the darkness.

""We're pretty shocked by how much it's blown up,"" Ginn said.

The legendary Bigfoot is commonly associated with the Pacific Northwest. But sightings have been reported all over the country and celebrated.

Durand and Ginn said their dog, a Rhodesian Ridgeback named Buu, didn't react to the alleged sighting.

""We're not believers,"" Durand said.",mainstream
1095,"The Illinois Statehouse installed several holiday decorations this year: A Nativity scene depicting the birth of Jesus, a Christmas tree, a Menorah and … a Satanic sculpture.

Entitled “Snaketivity”, the display depicts a snake wrapped around a woman’s hand as she holds an apple. On the side of the sculpture is the logo of the Satanic Temple – the head of Baphomet inside an inverted pentagram – and the words “Knowledge is the Greatest Gift”.

The symbolism of this sculpture refers to the book of Genesis and goes to the very core of Luciferian philosophy. It represents Eve grabbing the “forbidden fruit” of knowledge that was given to her by Lucifer who took the form of a serpent. Lucifer told Eve that biting the fruit would allow Adam and herself to become “like gods, knowing good and evil”. This is known as the “original sin” which God to expel Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden.

To Luciferians, the serpent is not a deceiver but a “savior” who allowed humanity to access the knowledge required to achieve divinity through its own means. The marking under the sculpture saying “Knowledge is the Greatest Gift” refers to the “gift” given from Lucifer to man in the form of divine knowledge. This interpretation of the book of Genesis has been, for centuries, a core difference between theistic religions and occult schools.

Despite the very biblical meaning of its display, the Satanic Temple insists that its goal is not about proselytizing for its own religion. Next to the sculpture, the Satanic Temple also installed an also inscription saying: “Religion is but myth and superstition that hardens hearts and enslaves minds”.

In a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for the sculpture, the Satanic Temple wrote:

Another sign near the sculpture contains a disclaimer from the state:

“The State of Illinois is required by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution to allow temporary, public displays in the state capitol so long as these displays are not paid for by taxpayer dollars. Because the first floor of the Capitol Rotunda is a public place, state officials cannot legally censor the content of speech or displays. The United States Supreme Court has held that public officials may legally impose reasonable time, place and manner restrictions regarding displays and speeches, but no regulation can be based on the content of the speech.”

Dave Druker, the spokesman for the secretary of state, confirmed that the Chicago-based Satanic Temple had the right to place its sculpture on display inside the statehouse.

This is not the first PR stunt conducted by the Satanic Temple. And, every time the Temple does something, media sources make sure to emphasize that the Satanic Temple is “not a group of devil worshipers, but liberal political activists who oppose the increasing influence of the religious right in American politics”.

However, despite its venerable speeches about its “principles” and “separating church and state”, all it actually accomplishes is having Satanic stuff put on display in public spaces. Here are some examples of its stunts.

In 2015, the Satanic Temple unveiled a massive statue of Baphomet in Detroit in what was dubbed “the largest satanic event in history”.

The unveiling took place in an industrial building near Detroit River after attempts to have the Baphomet sculpture installed at the Oklahoma State Capitol failed. Entry to the venue required guests to sign a contract “selling their souls to the devil”. The proceeds from the event went to support abortion rights – one of the Temple’s favorite causes.

In 2016, the Satanic Temple created an after-school program called After School Satan. The program is up-and-running in several cities across the United States, including Atlanta, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Pensacola, Washington, D.C., Tucson, Springfield, MO, Seattle, WA, and Portland, OR.

The Satanic Temple is also working on other projects. The West Michigan Friends of The Satanic Temple are currently raising money on a GoFundMe page to bring their own “Satanic holiday monument” to the Michigan state Capitol.

Although media love to say that the Satanic Temple is about “science” and “rationality”, the fact remains that it did not advance any of these causes throughout the years. The only thing the Satanic Temple actually managed to accomplish is fully on-par with the elite’s agenda described on this site: To normalize satanism and its symbolism in the public space while making it appealing to the masses.",conspiracy
1315,"A TERRIFYING ""river monster"" that measured up to 50-foot long once hunted prey across the Sahara Desert.

Remains belonging to the Spinosaurus aegyptiacus date back 100million years – and reveal the mammoth size of the first aquatic dinosaur known to science.

This six-tonne predator is believed to have been a ""powerful swimmer"".

It would've been propelled by a huge fin-like tail, allowing it to hunt for prey in what were once vast river systems across the Sahara.

Fossil experts say it's the first time such an adaptation has been reported in a dinosaur.

“The Spinosaurus’ fin-like tail is a game changing discovery for us that fundamentally alters our understanding of how this dinosaur lived and hunted – it was actually a ‘river-monster’,"" said Dr David Unwin, of the University of Leicester.

“As well as its tail, many other features of this dinosaur, such as the high position of the nostrils, heavy bones, short legs, and paddle-like feet point to a life spent in the water rather than on land.

“Not only did dinosaurs dominate the land and take to the air as birds, they even went back into the water and became the top predators there as well.”

Lots of aquatic reptiles lived during the time of the dinosaurs, including plesiosaurs and mosasaurs.

But this is the first dinosaur believed to have lived an aquatic lifestyle.

The dinosaur grew to a mammoth 50-feet long – and would've sported a set of large, sharp teeth for gobbling prey.

Unlike the stiff tapering tail of a Tyrannosaurus rex, the Spinosaurus had a long-spited tail that was flexible and fin-like.

Remains of the dinosaur were found in the Kem Kem river beds, known for preserving long-extinct Cretaceous creatures.

Fossil hunters used photogrammetry to digitally capture the tail – and compared its swimming performance to other animals.

And the conclusion was that Spinosaurus was a ""truly water-dwelling, tail-propelled"" creature.

""This discovery is the nail in the coffin for the idea that non-avian dinosaurs never invaded the aquatic realm,"" said Dr Nizar Ibrahim, of the University of Detroit Mercy.

""This dinosaur was actively pursuing prey in the water column, not just standing in shallow waters waiting for fish to swim by. It probably spent most of its life in the water.”

But there's still one key mystery puzzling palaeontologists.

""One thing that still puzzles me though, is why only Spinosaurus became aquatic among the dinosaurs,"" said Professor David Martill, Professor of Palaeobiology at the University of Portsmouth.

""Why are there no aquatic iguanodons, or stegosaurs?""

In other news, researchers recently claimed that the ""most dangerous place in the history of planet Earth"" was Morocco 100million years ago.

An ancient decapitated skeleton buried in an kneeling position has been discovered in central China.

Analysis of a medieval mass grave has confirmed that the 48 individuals died during the Black Death in the UK.

And, a mysterious ring of mammoth bones built by our ancient ancestors has left scientists puzzled.

232,"Gangrene refers to the death of body tissue due to either a lack of blood flow or a serious bacterial infection. Gangrene commonly affects the extremities, including your toes, fingers and limbs, but it can also occur in your muscles and internal organs.

Your chances of developing gangrene are higher if you have an underlying condition that can damage your blood vessels and affect blood flow, such as diabetes or hardened arteries (atherosclerosis).

Treatments for gangrene include surgery to remove dead tissue, antibiotics and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The prognosis for recovery is better if gangrene is identified early and treated quickly.

When gangrene affects your skin, signs and symptoms may include:
• Skin discoloration — ranging from pale to blue, purple, black, bronze or red, depending on the type of gangrene you have
• Swelling or the formation of blisters filled with fluid on the skin
• Sudden, severe pain followed by a feeling of numbness
• Skin that feels cool or cold to the touch

If you have a type of gangrene that affects tissues beneath the surface of your skin, such as gas gangrene or internal gangrene, you may notice that:
• The affected tissue is swollen and very painful

A condition called septic shock can occur if a bacterial infection that originated in the gangrenous tissue spreads throughout your body. Signs and symptoms of septic shock include:
• Fever, possibly, though temperature may also run lower than the normal 96.8 F (36 C)

When to see a doctor

Gangrene is a serious condition and needs immediate treatment. Call your doctor right away if you have persistent, unexplained pain in any area of your body along with one or more of the following signs and symptoms:
• Skin changes — including discoloration, warmth, swelling, blisters or lesions — that won't go away
• Sudden pain at the site of a recent surgery or trauma

Gangrene may occur due to one or some of the following causes:
• Lack of blood supply. Your blood provides oxygen, nutrients to feed your cells, and immune system components, such as antibodies, to ward off infections. Without a proper blood supply, cells can't survive, and your tissue decays.
• Infection. If bacteria thrive unchecked for long, infection can take over and cause your tissue to die, causing gangrene.
• Trauma. Wounds that are traumatic, such as gunshot wounds or crushing injuries from car crashes, can cause bacteria to invade tissues deep within the body. When such tissues are infected, gangrene can occur.
• Dry gangrene. Dry gangrene is characterized by dry and shriveled skin ranging in color from brown to purplish blue or black. Dry gangrene may develop slowly. It occurs most commonly in people who have arterial blood vessel disease, such as atherosclerosis, or in people who have diabetes.
• Wet gangrene. Gangrene is referred to as ""wet"" if there's a bacterial infection in the affected tissue. Swelling, blistering and a wet appearance are common features of wet gangrene. It may develop after a severe burn, frostbite or injury. It often occurs in people with diabetes who unknowingly injure a toe or foot. Wet gangrene needs to be treated immediately because it spreads quickly and can be fatal.
• Gas gangrene. Gas gangrene typically affects deep muscle tissue. If you have gas gangrene, the surface of your skin may initially appear normal. As the condition progresses, your skin may become pale and then evolve to a gray or purplish red color. A bubbly appearance to your skin may become apparent, and the affected skin may make a crackling sound when you press on it because of the gas within the tissue. Gas gangrene is most commonly caused by infection with the bacterium Clostridium perfringens, which develops in an injury or surgical wound that's depleted of blood supply. The bacterial infection produces toxins that release gas — hence the name ""gas"" gangrene — and cause tissue death. Like wet gangrene, gas gangrene can be life-threatening.
• Internal gangrene. Gangrene that affects one or more of your organs, such as your intestines, gallbladder or appendix, is called internal gangrene. This type of gangrene occurs when blood flow to an internal organ is blocked — for example, when your intestines bulge through a weakened area of muscle in your abdomen (hernia) and become twisted. Internal gangrene may cause fever and severe pain. Left untreated, internal gangrene can be fatal.
• Fournier's gangrene. Fournier's gangrene involves the genital organs. Men are more often affected, but women can develop this type of gangrene as well. Fournier's gangrene usually arises due to an infection in the genital area or urinary tract and causes genital pain, tenderness, redness and swelling.
• Progressive bacterial synergistic gangrene (Meleney's gangrene). This rare type of gangrene typically occurs after an operation, with painful skin lesions developing one to two weeks after surgery.

Several factors increase your risk of developing gangrene. These include:
• Diabetes. If you have diabetes, your body doesn't produce enough of the hormone insulin (which helps your cells take up blood sugar) or is resistant to the effects of insulin. High blood sugar levels can eventually damage blood vessels, decreasing or interrupting blood flow to a part of your body.
• Blood vessel disease. Hardened and narrowed arteries (atherosclerosis) and blood clots also can block blood flow to an area of your body.
• Severe injury or surgery. Any process that causes trauma to your skin and underlying tissue, including an injury or frostbite, increases your risk of developing gangrene, especially if you have an underlying condition that affects blood flow to the injured area.
• Smoking. People who smoke have a higher risk of gangrene.
• Obesity. Obesity often accompanies diabetes and vascular disease, but the stress of extra weight alone can also compress arteries, leading to reduced blood flow and increasing your risk of infection and poor wound healing.
• Immunosuppression. If you have an infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or if you're undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy, your body's ability to fight off an infection is impaired.
• Medications or drugs that are injected. In rare instances, certain medications and illegal drugs that are injected have been shown to cause infection with bacteria that cause gangrene.

Gangrene can lead to scarring or the need for reconstructive surgery. Sometimes, the amount of tissue death is so extensive that a body part, such as your foot, may need to be removed (amputated).

Gangrene that is infected with bacteria can spread quickly to other organs and may be fatal if left untreated.

Here are a few suggestions to help you reduce your risk of developing gangrene:
• Care for your diabetes. If you have diabetes, make sure you examine your hands and feet daily for cuts, sores and signs of infection, such as redness, swelling or drainage. Ask your doctor to examine your hands and feet at least once a year, and try to maintain control over your blood sugar levels.
• Lose weight. Excess pounds not only put you at risk of diabetes but also place pressure on your arteries, constricting blood flow and putting you at risk of infection and slow wound healing.
• Don't use tobacco. The chronic use of tobacco products can damage your blood vessels.
• Help prevent infections. Wash any open wounds with a mild soap and water and try to keep them clean and dry until they heal.
• Watch out when the temperature drops. Frostbitten skin can lead to gangrene because frostbite reduces blood circulation in an affected area. If you notice that any area of your skin has become pale, hard, cold and numb after prolonged exposure to cold temperatures, call your doctor.",mainstream
458,"Kids, listen up. Parents, you too. I guess it needs to be said… DON’T DRINK BLEACH!

That includes the trending “Miracle Mineral Solution” – MMS. I Repeat… Don’t drink bleach! There is NO CURE for CHLORINE POISONING!

Now that we got the early-warning part out of the way, here’s the what, when, and why behind this completely insane and life-threatening online trend.

First of all, you need to understand that household chlorine bleach is used to clean, whiten, and disinfect. You may have noticed a large jug of it in the laundry room. It is harmless when added in recommended (small) doses to water for cleaning purposes. A few drops added to water will purify it for drinking.

But breathing, swallowing or skin contact with larger amounts of chlorine bleach is extremely harmful to human health.

It all started ten years ago, according to a couple of YouTube pranksters. Jordan Thornsburg approached Brad Diehl with an idea they both thought would be hilarious and released a video called “The Bleach Challenge.”

The 2009 video went viral. It was intended as a practical joke, a spoof on another internet-based challenge that involved people trying to drink a gallon of milk without up-chucking it.

In the video, Diehl appears to drink a name-brand bleach straight from its gallon-sized white bottle. Following scenes show Diehl vomiting a red, chunky liquid which viewers assumed was blood and stomach contents. But no. That was actually tomato juice.

The video seemed so real that kids of all ages (even those over 18 years old, if you catch my drift) began rose to meet the challenge. A 17-year-old Belgian named Kris Weemaels was hospitalized with severe burns to his esophagus after he downed “several slugs” of pure bleach.

Why did the young man drink pure bleach? Because his friends bet him 10 Euros (currently worth $11.30 in US dollars) that he wouldn’t do it.

Jan Tytgat, a toxicologist from the University of Leuven in Belgium, said that esophageal burns were “just the beginning” and that the lad’s vital organ could be “eaten away” completely. Even worse health consequences could happen if the bleach makes its way into the stomach where it reacts with gastric (stomach) acid.

Videographer Thornsburg said that he thought everyone who watched the video would understand it was meant as a joke:

“I wanted it to be so ridiculous that it was just funny, like it was just going to be scripted and it would be hilarious and ridiculous, like no way is any of this real.”

Near the end of a second, 10-year-anniversary video which Thornsburg posted recently, Diehl didn’t actually apologize for endangering his highly-suggestible viewers, but did claim he had no idea people would take this absurd notion seriously:

“I was appalled that my friends legitimately thought I would drink bleach. I’m stupid, but I’m not drink-bleach stupid…DON’T DRINK BEACH!”

Thornsburg himself called his own comedic creation “stupid,” and said, “It was made to be a totally ridiculous parody on consumption challenges.”

Peer pressure is very powerful. Just about everyone wants to be popular, impress for success, and make friends with the “in” crowd. Be wise and do some online research before joining dangerously idiotic crazes such as eating detergent pods, which is another major health hazard and really bad thing to do.

Spare yourself the agony and spare your parents the expense of rushing to the hospital emergency room to get poison aid. The signs of chlorine poisoning are downright terrifying and include:

Check out the complete list of chlorine poisoning symptoms here.

Fast-forward to the present. An alleged cure for lethal illnesses and autism is being promoted quite seriously – and gullible people are swallowing it (figuratively and literally). “It” is called the “Miracle Mineral Solution” or MMS.

Last month, on May 21, 2019, YouTube influencer Jordan Sather tweeted this message:

“I’ve drank [sic] MMS (a.k.a. chlorine dioxide), brushed my teeth with it, breathed it, cleaned with it, used it topically…If MMS was a ‘toxic bleach,’ I should be dead. Sorry FDA and fake news media, you lose this one.”

Sather should be dead if he did what he claims he did. And, while I’m no big fan of all FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) determinations, sometimes they do get it right. This is one of those times – MMS is industrial bleach, plain and simple:

“Chlorine dioxide is a mix of sodium chlorite and an acid activator that former Scientologist Jim Humble first hawked as a miracle cure two decades ago. Humble claimed MMS had cured malaria, leading him to name himself archbishop of a new religion centered around chlorine dioxide, which he dubbed the Miracle Mineral Solution, or MMS. Humble touted MMS as a cure for AIDS, cancer and diabetes.”

For the record, common household chlorine bleach “is the number one cause of accidental poisonings in the U.S. with more than 50,000 cases (including eight deaths) reported to poison control centers in a single year.”

If you or someone you know has drunk bleach, ACT IMMEDIATELY. The odds of recovering depend on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster you get medical assistance, the better the chance for recovery. Follow these guidelines:
• Never induce vomiting (the bleach will do damage coming back up the throat)
• Make haste! Go to an emergency medical facility and explain what happened.
• If you have no transportation, dial 911 or your local emergency services number.

For more information about chlorine, contact these agencies:
• Poison Help hotline: 1-800-222-1222 (toll-free from anywhere in the U.S.)

Don’t be “drink-bleach stupid.” Use the common sense you were born with and the cell phone your parents bought you to do some online research before you follow the latest online consumption challenge.",conspiracy
1340,"The highly secretive Bilderberg group is holding its 62nd annual conference in Denmark from May 29 to June 1 at the Copenhagen Marriott Hotel in Denmark. This year’s conference is a mingling of military-intelligence, politicians, finance, oil, media, academia and neocon think tanks.

(Click here for the official list of attendees. Note that there are always participants who are not mentioned on the list given to the public).

While Bilderberg claims its annual conference is “to foster dialogue between Europe and North America”, the Worldwide monetary system as well as the US-NATO global war agenda are slated to be discussed behind closed doors.

According to Bilderberg expert Daniel Estulin, the group went as far as planning the 2008 economic crisis:

According to Estulin’s sources, which have been proven highly accurate in the past, Bilderberg is divided on whether to put into motion, “Either a prolonged, agonizing depression that dooms the world to decades of stagnation, decline and poverty… or an intense-but-shorter depression that paves the way for a new sustainable economic world order, with less sovereignty but more efficiency.” The information takes on added weight when one considers the fact that Estulin’s previous economic forecasts, which were based on leaks from the same sources, have proven deadly accurate. Estulin correctly predicted the housing crash and the 2008 financial meltdown as a result of what his sources inside Bilderberg told him the elite were planning based on what was said at their 2006 meeting in Canada and the 2007 conference in Turkey. Details of the economic agenda were contained in a pre-meeting booklet being handed out to Bilderberg members. On a more specific note, Estulin warns that Bilderberg are fostering a false picture of economic recovery, suckering investors into ploughing their money back into the stock market again only to later unleash another massive downturn which will create “massive losses and searing financial pain in the months ahead,” according to a Canada Free Press report.

In light of the above, it is important to highlight the presence at the 2014 meeting of the elite banking groups which benefited from the 2008 financial meltdown not to mention the generous bailouts. These include the iconic “too big to fail” bank, Goldman Sachs, the “bank that rules the world”.

Goldman Sachs will be represented by: Peter D. Sutherland, Chairman of Goldman Sachs International, and Robert B. Zoellick, Chairman of the Board of International Advisors of The Goldman Sachs Group.

Their presence is by no means accidental. Both Sutherland and Zoellick “in their previous lives” before joining Goldman played key roles in strategic trade negotiations including NAFTA and the WTO.

The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is on the Bilderberg agenda and Goldman Sachs is intent upon playing a leading role.

“Too big to jail” HSBC will also have representatives, the Group Chairman of HSBC Holdings, Douglas J. Flint, and his senior advisor Sherard Cowper-Coles. These mega banks have a longstanding record of financial fraud:

The leaders of the “Too big to Jail Banks” not only mingle behind closed doors together with Central Bank governors and the Managing Director of the IMF Christine Lagarde, they also exchange pointed views on “War and Economy” with the West’s top military brass, as well as the head of Britain’s Secret Service and NATO Secretary General Anders Fog Rasmussen.

Before the 2008 meltdown, Goldman Sachs made enormous profits out of products it sold knowing it was “crap”.

But Goldman is above the law. In 2012 the US justice Department issued a statement saying that after an exhaustive investigation, they “concluded that the burden of proof to bring a criminal case (against Goldman) could not be met based on the law and facts as they exist at this time”. James Hall explains:

Using the distinctive absurdity of legal rationalization, RT reports:

As for “too big to jail” HSBC, on December 10, 2013 the US Justice Department “announced a settlement with the British-based HSBC bank regarding charges of money laundering Mexican drug funds that allows the bank to admit to wrongdoing and pay a fine without being criminally charged.”

It is worth noting the presence of two major personalities responsible for the 2008 financial meltdown, Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers, both part of the “Wall Street-Washington consensus”.

Here’s a few interesting facts about Robert Rubin, who, lest we forget, was the one who had the Glass-Steagall Act abolished, a move that paved the way to the Wall Street casino and lead to the 2008 collapse:

Robert Rubin was Secretary of the Treasury from 1995 to 1999… Later, hand in hand with the IMF, he enforced shock therapies that actually worsened the crises that occurred in South-East Asia in 1997-98 and in Russia and Latin America in 1999.

Never for a moment did Rubin doubt the benefits of liberalisation and he contributed to imposing on the populations of developing countries the very policies which have caused their living conditions to deteriorate and social inequality to deepen.

In the United States he insisted on the abrogation of the Glass Steagall Act – officially named the Banking Act – voted in 1933 to ensure that deposit banks and investment banks were not in the same hands.

Its abrogation opened the door to all sorts of excesses on the part of finance people greedy for more profits, and eventually led to the current international crisis.

To come a full circle, the repeal of Banking Act made it possible for Citicorp to merge with Travelers Group and become the banking giant Citigroup. Rubin was later to become one of the main executive officers of Citigroup… which the US government recently bailed out in November 2008 in that it guaranteed over 300 billion dollars of assets! And in spite of his record, Rubin is one of Obama’s main advisors.

Lawrence Summers, another fan of the IMF-World Bank shock therapy, also played his part in the 2008 financial crash.

Harvard University Economics Professor Lawrence Summers served as Chief Economist for the World Bank (1991–1993). He contributed to shaping the macro-economic reforms imposed on numerous indebted developing countries. The social and economic impact of these reforms under the IMF-World Bank sponsored structural adjustment program (SAP) were devastating, resulting in mass poverty.

Larry Summer’s stint at the World Bank coincided with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the imposition of the IMF-World Bank’s deadly ” economic medicine” on Eastern Europe, the former Soviet republics and the Balkans.

In 1993, Summers moved to the US Treasury. He initially held the position of Undersecretary of the Treasury for international affairs and later Deputy Secretary. In liaison with his former colleagues at the IMF and the World Bank, he played a key role in crafting the economic “shock treatment” reform packages imposed at the height of the 1997 Asian crisis on South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia.

Larry Summers became Treasury Secretary in July 1999. He is a protégé of David Rockefeller. He was among the main architects of the infamous Financial Services Modernization Act, which provided legitimacy to inside trading and outright financial manipulation.

The Financial Post also reported last August that Summers “collected more than US$2.7-million in speaking fees, including from companies such as Citigroup and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. that later received taxpayer funds in the economic bailout, according to his disclosure forms.”

Now here’s a piece of history illustrating the role of Goldman Sachs in the eyes of Summers:

What these various examples portray is the revolving doors between the politicians and banksters. The banking industry is criminalized. But at the same time the judicial system which turns a blind eye to financial fraud is also criminalized.

TARP was designed to bail out the insolvent banks. Goldman Sachs transformed itself into a BANK so that the firm could borrow from the Fed window. The revolving door cycle of government regulators, opting for a promotion as an investment bankster and compensatory profit well earned from previous service, hardly gets the attention of the financial community or government oversight.

The entire obscene relationship of crony favoritism inevitably leads to a society where the rule of law only applies to the competition. (Hall, op.cit.)

It comes as no surprise that the derivatives bubble is now twenty percent bigger than it was before the 2008 collapse.

It is a financial bubble far larger than anything the world has ever seen, and when it finally bursts it is going to be a complete and utter nightmare for the financial system of the planet.

According to the Bank for International Settlements, the total notional value of derivatives contracts around the world has ballooned to an astounding 710 trillion dollars.

And guess which banks have “experienced tremendous growth in this area in recent years”? Goldman Sachs and Citibank.

Goldman Sachs has been increasing its derivatives volumes since the crisis, and it had a portfolio of about $48 trillion at the end of 2013. Bloomberg Businessweek recently reported that as part of its growth strategy, Goldman plans to sell more derivatives to clients.

Citibank, too, has been increasing its derivatives portfolio, despite the numerous capital and regulatory challenges, In fact, its portfolio has risen by over 65 percent since the crisis — the most of any of the four banks — to $62 trillion. (Ibid.)

Also on the Bilderberg guest list this year are very influential figures from the financial press, Martin H. Wolf, The Financial Times’ Chief Economics Commentator and John Micklethwait Editor-in-Chief of The Economist.

While they are not allowed to report on what happens behind closed doors, they will no doubt play a key role in sustaining the legitimacy of the Bilderberg elites and their destructive neoliberal agenda.

IMF chief Christine Lagarde will also be attending. She was recently interrogated in France in regards to a corruption case. She allegedly “allowed 270 million pounds Bernard Tapie, a convicted football match-fixer and tax dodger who supported her governing UMP party”. She was then accused by the opposition “of ‘dipping into the taxpayers’ pocket for a private beneficiary.’”

But we might wonder: how could the elite exist without “dipping into taxpayers pockets for private beneficiarie(s)?” The 2008 global economic crisis is probably the most glaring example of this now very well-known scheme: socializing debt and privatizing profits, using taxpayer money to bailout the criminal banks.

Is it a “conspiracy” when financial fraudsters meet behind closed mingling with politicians, oil execs and NATO military strategists? Does Bilderberg bear a responsibility for the 2008 crisis?

Italian Member of the European Parliament Mario Borghezio blamed the organization “for Italy’s economic crisis… causing unemployment, poverty, and high taxes.”

Borghezio is supported by Italian lawyer Alfonso Luigi Marra, who last year requested that the Public Prosecutor of Rome investigate the Bilderberg Group for its role in “criminal activity.”

Marra accused the group of plotting to install Mario Monti as Prime Minister of Italy at Bilderberg’s 2011 meeting in Switzerland, labeling the organization a “unique, illegal brotherhood” of elitists who consider themselves to be “above the law.” …

In 2010, former NATO Secretary-General and Bilderberg member Willy Claes admitted that Bilderberg attendees are mandated to implement decisions that are formulated during the annual conference of power brokers. If this is the case, it would violate laws in numerous countries that forbid politicians from being influenced by foreign agents in secret.

Bilderberg is a powerful entity compared to the Davos World Economic Forum:

Although we don’t find much information on its web site, Bilderberg acknowledges that the “hospitality costs of the annual meeting are the responsibility of the Steering Committee member(s) of the host country.”

This year, the only member “responsible” for hospitality costs is Ulrik Federspiel, former Foreign Minister (1991-93, 2005-09) and Danish Ambassador to the United States of America (2000-2005). He’s now Haldor Topsøe’s Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer.

Haldor Topsøe is a company specialized in catalysts used in various industries and which won the 2014 World XTL award, “given annually to a company that has made an outstanding contribution” to the oil, power and gas industry.

This award is given by the CWC Group “world expert in the oil and gas, power and investment sectors, with particular expertise in emerging markets.” It is worth noting that their sponsors include, among others, Shell and BP, two companies which will attend this year’s conference. It’s a small world.

It is hard to imagine how much this kind of event for kings and queens, world state officials and business leaders can cost, but it is very unlikely that Mr. Federspiel will be himself paying the bill for a four day stay of over 140 elites in a five star hotel under high safety and surveillance.

Where will he get the money? Will his company or the Danish government be paying the costs? We don’t know. But the Danes will most likely and unwillingly be paying part of the bill collectively, at least for the security apparatus of the meeting. This is not a public meeting. The media is not even allowed to report on it.

Last year the security costs for the Bilderberg meeting in Watford England cost over half a million pounds to British taxpayers:

The irony is that, each and every year, a police security apparatus whose mandate is to protect citizens “against crooks and criminals” is being deployed to ensure the security of the Bilderberg elites, i.e., using public funds to “protect crooks and criminals against citizens”.

War criminal Henry Kissinger, architect of the 1973 Chilean coup that put Pinochet in power, the man “who oversaw the slaughter in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos” leading to millions of civilian deaths, will also be at the Marriott this weekend, to “foster dialogue”.

Former CIA Director and US Forces Commander David H. Petraeus, another notable war criminal, who knowingly used drones to bomb Afghan civilians at funerals and civilian rescuers, will be among the distinguished guests.

In a bitter irony, Petraeus, “who now works at the Manhattan-based private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR)” specialized in leveraged buyouts is now developing ties with the shale gas industry.

In this regard, North Dakota Treasurer Kelly Schmidt facilitated a field trip for Petraeus and said to journalists that “the blurred lines existing between the North Dakota government, the oil industry and private equity firms like KKR (are) ‘not unusual.’”

On his trip, Petraeus gave a speech to the National Guard. “In introducing Petraeus at the National Guard event, Schmidt thanked the troops in attendance for fighting in a war ‘over there for the oil we all need.’”

The 2014 Bilderberg meeting is another example of those “blurred lines” between government, big oil and the financial sector, the three pillars of war.

According to some reports, the topics of discussion at this year’s meeting will include the situation in Ukraine and the Russia-NATO relationship, as well as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), an agreement which, according to Stop TTIP, “is in fact a corporate coup that will take us to a ‘corporatocracy’, a corporate-run world.”

The list of participants clearly indicates that war and the economy will be key topics discussed by fraudulent bankers and corrupt politicians who are above the law and who have little concern for the rights of ordinary people.

It is scary to say the least.

But for the mainstream media, very influential and powerful criminals meeting for 4 days in a 5 star hotel and vowing secrecy about their discussions does not raise an eye lid. If you think they are meeting for a purpose that might have a significant impact on world politics and the global economy, you’re just a nutcase.",conspiracy
836,"Why on earth would the US government conspire to cover up any kind of archaeological findings? Of what possible threat could honest, scientific discovery pose to national security or the common good?

Yet, this is exactly what happened when American diggers found skeletal remains of oversize humans: giants.

Disclose.tv reported earlier this year on a story that was ridiculed and debunked as soon as it was made public some decades ago: that the Smithsonian Institution destroyed thousands of giant human skeletons.

The World News Daily Report was the first publication to claim that the US cover-up of giant human remains began in the early 1900s. (It is entirely possible that earlier cases will be found, in the future.)

This leading scientific organization responded to allegations of their deceitful actions by filing a lawsuit to protect their sterling reputation. The Event Chronicle fills in the details:

“A US Supreme Court ruling has forced the Smithsonian institution to release classified papers dating from the early 1900’s that proves the organization was involved in a major historical cover-up of evidence showing giants human remains in the tens of thousands had been uncovered all across America and were ordered to be destroyed by high-level administrators to protect the mainstream chronology of human evolution at the time.

“The allegations stemming from the American Institution of Alternative Archeology (AIAA) that the Smithsonian Institution had destroyed thousands of giant human remains during the early 1900’s was not taken lightly by the Smithsonian who responded by suing the organization for defamation and trying to damage the reputation of the 168-year old institution.

“…Smithsonian whistle blowers admitted to the existence of documents that allegedly proved the destruction of tens of thousands of human skeletons reaching between 6 feet and 12 feet in height, a reality mainstream archeology can not admit to for different reasons, claims AIAA spokesman, James Churward.”

Honestly, covering up the existence of giants on earth, in order to preserve a theory that explains how humans came to inhabit North America, makes very little sense: who stands to gain, and who stands to lose?

Could it be that the US leadership decided that the citizenry would freak out from the news of giants who lived in the distant past?

The Bible (Genesis 6:4) states very matter-of-factly: “There were giants in the Earth in those days” – as if contemporary readers knew this to be true, undoubtedly from the passage of oral tradition. Great warriors like Goliath (bested by David and his sling) were described, and the locations of giants’ kingdoms were disclosed.

Many other civilizations around the world have “myths” about giants, as listed in this fascinating article by an unnamed author. American immigrants brought their cultural heritages with them.

But a folk tale is a far cry from scientific rigor. So why the modern cover-up of actual physical evidence that supports those “children’s stories?”

One mundane explanation would be that influential (as in, wealthy), mainstream archaeologists wanted to maintain their scientific supremacy, and persuaded the federal government to help perpetuate the lie that giants never existed anywhere in the world, much less in the continental US. After all, schools taught that the earliest American inhabitants trekked over a Bering Strait land bridge – over the north pole, nearly – into modern-day Alaska a mere 15,000 years ago. Perhaps the scientific community “needed to be right?”

Fortunately for Us the People, with the age of the internet and instant, global communication the Truth is becoming harder and harder to hide.

In this century, the oldest human fossils – not gigantic, by the way – have been found in northern Africa (Jebel Irhoud, Morocco). These remains date to around 315,000 years old, as The Atlantic Daily, Nature, and other scientific publications have reported!

Archaeological discoveries keep pushing the date of human (homo sapiens sapiens, that is) origin further and further back in time.

These dates happen to jive with ancient source texts that discuss human origin, notably the Sumerian clay tablets translated by Zecharia Sitchin. This Azerbaijani-born American researcher and author upset the anthropological world with his revelation that humans had been bred by an off-world race called the Annunaki – “alien overlords” (in this case, the term actually does fit) – to serve them, especially to mine gold in the hot African sun.

Just as the Bible later described, the Annunaki – or “fallen angels” – bred with human women and birthed…a race of giants called the Nephilim. The giants had big appetites, and devoured all the crops and livestock before turning to humans as their next food source. At this point, the Annunaki admitted that the Nephilim had gotten out of hand, and flooded the earth as a global Mulligan (“do-over”) – kind of like shaking an Etch-a-Sketch upside down in order to “clean the slate.”

Now, this is where the conspiracy about giants gets interesting. Sitchin’s work continues to be refuted by “experts,” even as more archaeological evidence of beings with elongated skulls, giants and ancient African gold mines inhabited by early humans continues to pile up.

Is the New World Order actually threatened by a citizenry that is fully aware of our alien-hybridized human origin?

If people, collectively, understood that we were created to serve ETs (termed “gods” in ancient texts), how would that change our society and others around the world?

Ignoring the Illuminati agenda, alternative news sources continue to report similar “gigantic” findings from around the world. To cite just a couple: “Nephilim Bones and Giant Human Skeletons in Greece” and “Skeletons of 5,000-year-old Chinese ‘giants’ discovered by archaeologists.”

Regardless of the “why” behind yet another government discovery/lie/cover-up, it is clear that, in those days, yeah – there really were giants.",conspiracy
567,"* Third major Gulf of Mexico project in less than 3 months

HOUSTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has approved $4 billion for its Big Foot project, in its second major Gulf of Mexico development in two months, even as tougher rules and higher costs loom for U.S. deepwater operators.

Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) gave the go-ahead in late September for a second deepwater production hub at its prolific Mars field in the Gulf, indicating the major oil companies will shoulder extra costs to maintain production growth near one of the world’s biggest oil markets.

“Sanctioning Big Foot underscores our commitment to the Gulf of Mexico and will contribute to future U.S. energy supply,” George Kirkland, vice chairman of Chevron, said in a statement on Thursday.

Chevron, Big Foot’s operator, controls 60 percent of the project, while Norway’s Statoil STL.OL has 27.5 percent and Japan’s Marubeni Corp (8002.T) holds the remainder.

Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company behind Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), has continued to invest in the Gulf despite lingering uncertainty over U.S. regulations following BP Plc’s (BP.L) oil spill, with drilling permits still hard to secure.

Chevron said in October it planned to spend $7.5 billion at its Jack/St Malo project in the Gulf. [ID:nN21259958]

Chevron also extended contracts for two shallow-water rigs in the Gulf by six months, at higher rates, rig owner Ensco Plc ESV.N said late on Wednesday. Marubeni, meanwhile, sublet deepwater rig Ensco 8502 for 35 days as the existing client awaits a permit, possibly to drill in one of the four fields Marubeni just bought from BP. [ID:nTOE69O060]

Big Foot, located about 225 miles (360 km) south of New Orleans in water depths of 5,200 feet (1,600 m), is expected to have production capacity of 75,000 barrels of oil and 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day.

First oil is anticipated in 2014, which will be a big year for Chevron. The company is expecting overall annual production growth of only 1 percent through 2014, when its first massive natural gas development off Australia will start up.

The San Ramon, California-based company said last week it planned to increase spending by 20 percent next year, with most of its $26 billion budget earmarked for exploration and production. [ID:nN09222898].

Chevron shares rose 1.2 percent on Thursday to $89.06, their best close since September 2008, compared with a 0.56 percent rise in the Chicago Board Options Exchange index of oil companies. .OIX (Reporting by Anna Driver and Kristen Hays in Houston and Braden Reddall in San Francisco, editing by Gerald E.

637,"Lateral foot pain can cause a variety of symptoms, most of which depend on which part of the foot is affected.

Lateral foot pain is pain that runs along the outer side of the foot and ankle. It can occur before, during, or after activities such as walking and running. Lateral foot pain can make it difficult for people to move around or even stand.

What are the causes?

Lateral foot pain can have many causes. Most of them arise from conditions that were left untreated. These could include:
• the presence of very fine cracks in the foot bones and in the ankle
• stretched, torn, or pinched nerves (especially those passing through the ankle)

The following conditions lead to lateral foot pain:

An ankle sprain is a ligament injury in the foot, without dislocation or a fracture. This is one of the main causes of lateral foot pain, with 85 percent of ankle sprains leading to lateral foot pain.

Cuboid syndrome is a partial dislocation of one of the lateral foot bones known as the cuboid bone. This injury may occur due to excessive tension or too much weight on the bone.

This syndrome usually occurs when a person does too much sport and physical activity without allowing any recovery time between exercise sessions. Sometimes, wearing tight shoes can also cause cuboid syndrome.

Cuboid syndrome is an uncommon cause of lateral foot pain that frequently goes undiagnosed. It can cause long-term symptoms, such as pain, weakness, and tenderness.

Bunions are a bone defect that makes the big toe of the foot rotate inwards and point to the other toes. As a consequence, people put most of their body weight on the lateral side of the foot when walking or standing, which causes pain.

Bunions may be caused by genetic factors or poor footwear that squashes the toes. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the bunion and realign the toes.

Peroneal tendonitis occurs as a result of repetitive tension of the peroneal tendons. These two tendons extend from the back of the calf, over the outer edge of the outer ankle and attach at different points on the lateral side of the foot.

This condition causes the peroneal tendons to swell or become inflamed, resulting in pain on the lateral side of the foot and the heel.

A person who runs excessively or places their foot abnormally may develop peroneal tendonitis. It may also occur after an ankle sprain.

Stress fractures are small breaks in one of the outer foot bones (called metatarsals), due to repetitive sports and physical exercise. Symptoms of this injury may be mild initially but gradually worsen.

Corns and calluses develop on the lateral side of the foot. They often develop as a result of the body producing multiple skin layers to protect the foot from repetitive stress and friction. Although calluses are usually painless, corns can penetrate deeper into the skin and be painful.

Arthritis is a disease that causes lateral foot pain when it affects the foot joint. Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common type of arthritis.

Tarsal coalition is a congenital condition, meaning that it is present at birth. Tarsal coalition occurs when the tarsal bones near the back of the foot do not connect properly. This unusual connection between the two bones often leads to stiffness and pain in the foot.

Tarsal coalition is a rare condition. According to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, about 1 in every 100 people have the condition.",mainstream
1131,"Reported sightings of Bigfoot the legendary apelike creature that's been a favorite of cryptozoologists for decades have abounded for decades. Now, for the first time, someone has created a map showing the places where alleged Bigfoot sightings have occurred.

Joshua Stevens, a doctoral candidate at Pennsylvania State University, used data compiled by the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO), which tries to document ""the presence of an animal, probably a primate, that exists today in very low population densities,"" according to the group's website.

Stevens converted the BFRO data and, using geographic-information software, plotted 3,313 data points showing where people have claimed to see Bigfoot (aka Sasquatch, Skunk Ape, Yeti, Skookum or dozens of other names). [Rumor or Reality: Tales of 10 Creatures of Cryptozoology]

""Right away, you can see that sightings are not evenly distributed,"" Stevens said on his website. ""There are distinct regions where sightings are incredibly common, despite a very sparse population. On the other hand, in some of the most densely populated areas, Sasquatch sightings are exceedingly rare. The terrain and habitat likely play a major role in the distribution of reports.""

The map, which uses reports from 1921 to 2012, shows a plethora of supposed sightings in the Pacific Northwest, the Ohio River Valley, central Florida, the Sierra Nevada mountain range and the Mississippi River Valley.

Stevens' analysis also includes a chronological timeline showing a rise in reported sightings in the late 1970s (perhaps coinciding with the release of several B-movies about the mythical creature). Another spike in reported Bigfoot sightings occurred between 2000 and 2009.

Despite his exhaustive analysis of the BFRO data, Stevens stops short of giving the information more credibility than it deserves. ""Ultimately, I'm not convinced there's a descendant of [giant ape] Gigantopithecus playing hide-and-seek in the Pacific Northwest,"" Stevens said. ""But if respectable folks like primatologist Jane Goodall believe there's something more to the myth, I think it's at least worth putting on the map.""

Goodall, in an interview that was broadcast on NPR in 2006, said, ""I'm sure that they exist."" The famed primate researcher also confessed, ""Well, I'm a romantic, so I always wanted that.""

A handful of other academics, including Jeffrey Meldrum, professor of anatomy and anthropology at Idaho State University in Pocatello, have taken a scientific interest in the legend of Bigfoot, but to date, no hard evidence of any hominid or apelike creature has been substantiated.

All alleged samples of Bigfoot hair, for example, have turned out to be from elk, bears or cows. Photos, audio and film footage have been determined to be inconclusive or hoaxes, and no bodily remains have ever been found despite the fact that there would have to be hundreds or thousands of the creatures in existence in order to maintain the ""species.""

But Bigfoot enthusiasts will no doubt continue their search undaunted and now, thanks to Stevens' map, they know where to look.

915,"Mass Mind-kontrol — it’s been going on since the time of Nimrod and ancient Babylonia. And it’s sinister and evil beyond words and description. Since Roswell it has taken a new sinister turn that defies imagination.



by Preston James, Ph.D on November 21, 2016

Note: This article is written for professional Intel and those who understand the Secret Space War program, the back engineering of recovered Alien ET technologies, and technologies obtained by treaties and exchange programs. Because VT is committed to open source Intel and believes that the public has a right to know how their taxpayer funds are being spent, especially when used to wage a secret war to hijack their mind, this information is being made available to anyone who is interested with no limitations. If you are not up to speed on this background reading, this article will probably be a waste of your time. There has been significant intercept actions to prevent this article from ever being published. It was suggested to me that I would not be able to ever complete this article or be allowed to publish it, but here it is. I must extend a big thank you to the Editors of VT who have allowed this article to be published and who are deeply committed to open source Intel, making such available to all who are interested in the truth even when it is hard to fathom.

The current state of mind-kontrol is probably far beyond anything you have ever imagined possible.



Mass Mind-kontrol — it’s been going on since the time of Nimrod and ancient Babylonia. And it’s sinister and evil beyond words and description. Since Roswell it has taken a new sinister turn that defies imagination.It’s what empowers the evil Cabal that has hijacked the USG and many of the governments of the world. Some insiders claim it is not of human origin.Cultural and educational methodologies typically have included coordinated efforts to instill certain values, beliefs and attitudes into the societal mass group mind, both conscious and subconscious.for controlling the American Mass Mind for purposes of social control and simulated beliefs and increased sales were readily adopted by Madison Avenue advertising agencies and elements of the USG.Bernays-type methodologies predetermined values, beliefs and attitudes in members of society that caused them to carry certain beliefs and mindsets which predispose them to act in ways that are beneficial to the ruling oligarchical class.It is the oligarchical class – folks who consider themselves “elite bloodline individuals chosen to rule over the masses” – who make certain that the educational and religious systems are instilled in this desired group mind set.

No real academic freedom exists in American Universities, so don’t expect scientists to help you figure out how your mind is being attacked psychotronically.



Despite the illusion of academic freedom in America’s universities, there is none. No classes are ever taught on how the Federal Reserve System is illegal and unconstitutional and how it charges us pernicious usury to use what should have been our own money in the first place.Or that the FRS stole all the US Gold and now replaced real US Dollars with paper debt notes backed by nothing but requiring repayment. Nor does any American University teach that 9-11-01 was a false-flag attack done by the JCS, USAF, NORAD, and the FAA using PNACers, top NeoCons, and Mossad.Doubt this statement that there is no academic freedom in academia in America? Just ask one of VT’s own Editors Dr. Kevin Barrett, or Professor James Tracy, both of whom were illegally and unconstitutionally fired by RKM educational policies adopted by the dupes in charge of faculty.Nor does any American University teach or allow any classes regarding Sandy Hook having been a two-day DHS/FEMA Capstone drill where nobody at all died, or that Adam Lanza never existed, but was a fake construct.Public and private education is designed and deployed to lead We The People away from truth and to instill values, beliefs and attitudes that make it easier for the Satanic Pedophile Network (Ruling Cabal) to maintain rule over us, keep us their secret serfs, and asset strip us blind, until America the Republic is destroyed from within.



 

The Major Mass Media News Cartel is still lying in lockstep about the JFK Assassination.

If you doubt the ability of the RKM’s Crime Cabal, which runs the USG, to control the Major Mass Media to keep the American Mass Mind filled with blatant lies, just consider how, over 50 years later, all the Major Mass Media Broadcast news are still claiming that Oswald assassinated JFK and was a “lone-nut” assassin.

Of course, surveys now show that 60-80% of the American People do not believe this at all, and instead many believe that the CIA, using Op40, did it and it was a major America Coup d’Etat involving GHWB, LBJ, J. Edgar Hoover, General Landsdale, General Lemnitzer, Allan Dulles and many more.

 When you create and control all the money you want, you can buy almost anyone and everyone, and promote those you want to the highest positions of power.

The Ruling Cabal controls the creation and distribution of money and can create all the power they need to implement their policies, which are designed to move mankind along a Globalist path leading to their long-desired Satanic NWO System.

Dark-side Psi-power is harnessed for evil by the ruling Cabal, which is Satanic and deeply committed to an inhuman, anti-human Globalist NWO Agenda that requires 90% depopulation.

Psi-power manipulations of the mass group mind is the little known but real practice of the spiritually based mind-control of the masses through the application of specific Black Arts to “manipulate, fracture and even eventually snatch the human soul” and replace it with non-human spiritual entities from the dark side.

Dark-side Psi-power is the technology used in trauma based mind-kontrol, and the means by which psychopaths and narcissists are inducted into the worldwide Satanic pedophile network in incrementally criminal, anti-human Satanic rituals of abuse, rape, torture and even sacrifice of captive innocent children to gain more and more evil Satanic psi-power.

Some insiders have reported that top cult members receive their own personal “spirit guide” as a consigliere, which periodically appears to them in private and “advises” them after they reach the level of child torture and child sacrifice. Some have claimed these are “Fallen Ones/Lesser Gods”; others claim they are very evil, deceptive and crafty demons or Djinns.



There is the reverse side to Dark-sided Psi-power, which is a spiritual entity. In basic form, it is the spontaneously emerging new populism, which is a direct offshoot of the Internet which is turning out to be the New Gutenberg Press. Some conservative Christians claim they can muster positive Psi-power directly from God Almighty through prayer and faith, and this is reflected in a new and strong desire to do what is right and moral, to serve others, to resist and stop evil and to treat others the way one desires to be treated.I have covered evil psi-power emanating from the ancient Babylonian Talmudic Black arts in prior articles and will get more specific in future articles. But it is so esoteric that it would pose a distraction from the main thrust of this article, which is the new ultra high tech remote mind war that is now being waged against your brain on many fronts, depending on where you reside.There is a secret alliance between Intel and the Ruling Satanic Pedophile Cabal that specializes in Black Arts for Mind War against We The People, Colonel Michael Aquino Style.Col. Michael Aquino, Army Psychological Operations expert and father of the Temple of Set and the entity which brought Satanism as an accepted religion into the US Army, as well as alleged to have run the pedophile operations at the Presidio in California and at Offutt AF Base in Omaha. One insider alleged that Col. Aquino was actually promoted to General of the NSA and still is active.It is now a well established fact that many of the world’s Intel agencies have formed a secret alliance with the worldwide Satanic pedophile network (an oligarchical cult) and has used the trauma-based mind-kontrol conditioning to create MPD/DID sleepers, agents and secret servants in every walk of life, every occupation and even within the Secret Service.In fact the Satanic Pedophile Cult Network (Ruling Cabal) inside America has been deputized as an agent of American national Security, and is used by America Intel as cover for numerous Mind-Kontrol experiments and deep black covert operations.American Law Enforcement is fully compromised by the Satanic Pedophile Network (Ruling Cabal).Every major police department in America as well a every FBI office including the WFO has a sheep-dipped individual who runs interference for the Satanic Pedophile Cabal that rules America.



 

Whenever the phrase “going black”, deep black, or “black operations” is used you can be certain that it always is anti-human, evil, based on ancient Babylonian Black Arts of deception, casuistry, equivocation, and sophistry designed to undermine human character and the natural will of the masses.

The documentation of MK-Ultra and other CIA mind-kontrol programs is so well established and now so public from declassified docs and vetted personal testimonies in front of Congressional Committees, that it is worthless to try and deny the existence of such programs. Every large city prosecutor knows it would be unwise to attempt to prosecute any of the Satanic crimes linked to the Satanic pedophile Network or any Satanic cult crimes or Satanic Ritual Abuse that would create any public cognizance of this issue.

And be certain of this, these MK-Ultra programs which were supposed to have been discontinued after the Church Commission, actually went Black (completely covert inside American Intel inside privatized defense contractors deputized under national security) and are still very active today and even expanding every year.

Back engineered Alien ET technologies have opened up Pandora’s box.

Back engineered Alien ET technologies have opened up Pandora’s box of remote inductive brain entrainment making it possible for Deep Black Intel groups (often buried deep within defense contractors or proprietaries in unacknowledged special access programs) to deploy incredibly sophisticated new weapons of “mindwar” against the American mass subconscious mind.

Ever since crashed UFOs were recovered in 1922 in the Black Forest and in Roswell NM in America in 1947, recovered and back-engineered Alien ET technologies have been a major game changer.

New Psychotronic Mindwar weapons have now been deployed in a secret assault on your brain to entrain it and in many cases on your body to make you physically ill and to shorten your life. The purpose is to help the Satanic Pedophile Network (Ruling Cabal) attain their inter-generational, age old Globalist NWO Agenda of evil which has been their wetdream ever since ancient Babylon.

As the new quantum based physics have evolved into the use of microwaves, pulsed beam microwaves, ELF and scalar (standing waves), it was learned that various sophisticated types of electric induction could be used to remotely entrain the brain to operate at certain desired frequencies.

Voice of God Technology.

And it was also discovered that voices and self-talk, as well as specific belief patterns, could be entrained directly into the brain remotely by use of sophisticated inductive methods, now referred to as advanced psychotronics.

There are numerous vetted and Rock solid reports of the deployment of the Voice of God remote inductive technology being deployed against the Republican Guard in the first Gulf War. This resulted in these Iraqi Soldiers hearing Allah’s voice inside their heads instructing them to throw down their arms and surrender after which hundreds were bulldozed into ditches and buried alive to their deaths.

This weapon system was then tabled not to be used again because the Cabal was concerned it would become too well known and that would lead to the discovery of their other similar weapons which are now being deployed, weapons much more subtle that instill attitudes and beliefs but usually no direct voices.

Some of the new remote entrainment technologies operate by the principal of inter-dimensional or quantum physics, that is immediate remote communication with a target through a medium of a different dimension where the carrier is alleged to be timeless Dimension waves (aka D-waves).



It’s a fact that Mass Mind-kontrol has taken a turn for the worse since Roswell. The new technologies developed from back engineered recovered crashed Alien ET UFOs are so sophisticated and so anti-free will and anti-human that unless taken Deep-Black and protected by numerous layers of “need to know”, extreme compartmenting and special access unaccounted programs, the public would rise up in mass and destroy those programs by whatever means necessary.

Without abject beyond-Black secrecy these sinister Mind-kontrol programs utilizing advanced psychotronics deployed and managed in real time by artificial intelligence, they could never survive intact.

Now for a presentation of current psychotronic weapons now being deployed against the brains of many Americans in select cities and select regions, and some known countermeasures which have been claimed to be effective.

Note: This section is long and those interested can pick and choose the subjects they want.

Some of these weapons such as ELF are deployed against a group of randomly selected citizens and a select group of federal and corporate whistleblowers. One group is used as an innocent control and the other as a group of targeted individuals who in some way are deemed a current or future threat to the Satanic Pedophile Network (Ruling Cabal).

Do not get discouraged and do not lose hope, help is now on the way on several fronts and you can do many things to protect yourself and your loved ones. I have instituted these countermeasures in my home and the homes of various friends and have been pleased with the results, which are backed up by professional quality meters.

As you read about these quite nasty psychotronic weapons now deployed against many of us Americans, please keep in mind that without abject secrecy that is now being denied, these soulless entities who are doing this to us will eventually be stopped cold by the new quite powerful spontaneously emerging populism which is now growing like an out of control wildfire.

Smartmeters and Dirty electricity: Activists claim that Smartmeters (they are digital instead of the old analog) are NOT UL rated like the old analog ones and that these Smartmeters have caused unexpected house fires and there are numerous complaints of much larger electric bills with the same prior usage, numerous complaints about sleeping problems, headaches, nervousness, agitation and various strange illness emerging. In some localities it is a violation to install devise that are not UL rated so folks need to organize into action groups to expose this and stop their use as a public health issue. This ignores the secret mind-kontrol aspects of Smartmeters but to focus on that issue is far too discrediting to ever get anywhere. Few members of the public who are not trained Psyops experts can fathom this unless they have been “targeted individuals” and experienced significant symptoms firsthand. Smartmeters can allegedly be remotely “turned up” to emit large EMF pulsed beam microwave bursts (numerous times per minute) and have been alleged by experts to be able to emit significant or very large amounts of dirty electricity (dirty harmonics) in ones AC circuits.

Counter measures include using grounded stainless steel screen or two thicknesses of grounded aluminum screen wrapped astound the Smartmeter itself, and by hanging an EMF shield of special fabric or two thicknesses of grounded, hanging aluminum screen inside which adequately blocks the inward emissions reaching your bedroom and living quarters. To be sure that you have reduced the EMF you will need to purchase an Microwave detector. There are many good quality ones available for the range of $80 to $400 which will cover Smartmeters (ask the seller which model will suffice). A certified EMF detector may cost up to $2,000 and will tell the difference between regular microwaves and pulsed beam microwaves and in what intensity in microwatts per square meter and a record of accumulation per time period. Smartmeters have been found in some areas to generate large amounts of dirty electrical harmonics in the AC circuits of one’s home. The gold standard for analysis of these AC dirty electricity harmonics is to analyze them with a properly connected AC oscilloscope, a fairly expensive piece of equipment.

I have personally tested my AC circuits for dirty electricity using a Greenwave Dirty electricity meter and after finding very high levels, I then installed Greenwave Electrical Filters which have dual capacitors, are grounded, are UL rated and are RoHC compliant (RoHS, also known as Lead-Free, stands for Restriction of Hazardous Substances. RoHS, also known as Directive 2002/95/EC, originated in the European Union and restricts the use of six hazardous materials found in electrical and electronic products. I prefer the Greenwave meter because it has an audio function that increases in volume with increased dirty electricity and a calculator that estimates the percentage of decrease when you add a filter. There is also the Stetzerizer meter and electrical filters available too which are also popular.

If you cannot afford to get a dirty electrical indicator/meter, one can detect significant dirty electricity and Lilly Waves by turning on an AM radio and moving the dial through the channels. AM channels will be very buzzy or fuzzy and reception will be very poor. For those that cannot afford dirty electricity filters, one can move their bed a bout 3 feet from the wall where the AC wires are, or turn off the breaker covering where they sleep at night. FM is not affected by dirty electricity.

Lilly Waves: In some locales these special behavior and health altering wave forms (a special type of dirty electricity harmonics) are purposely generated by special outside mounted line boxes into your household AC circuits. The purpose is to mind-kontrol you, make you ill, disturb your sleep, make you disturbed, cause relationship conflict with your significant other and break down the family system. This is a deep-black incredibly sinister system that can be detected by dirty electrical meters (Greenwave or Stetzerizer or by using an Osciliscop which is typically quite an expensive piece of equipment). If detected, these waves can be mitigated by the adequate installation of Greenwave or Stetzerizer Filters. The use of large line filters attached to your electrical supply work great but they start at about $5,000 and for most the cost is prohibitive. Use of the small AC filters which are between $25 and $35 each do an effective reducinfg Lilly waves and other forms of dirty electricity including that from Smartmeters if installed correctly.

Remote phones: I have swept a number of homes for EMF using sophisticated accurate EMF meters of several varieties. I have found that in those where the occupants had serious complaints of sleeping issues, headaches, loss of energy or irritability, EMF levels were in the range of up to 4,500 microwatts per square meter, high enough to cause behavioral and health problems, especially in those who may be electro-sensitive. Now here is the strange part.

When I swept a well know federal Whistleblower’s home, I found significant dirty electricity in the AC circuits that were easily reduced down to an acceptable level by the installation of Greenwave Filters. But I also found especially high microwave levels being emitted from his two remote phone base stations which are powerful transmitters. When I mentioned the reading was 4,400 microwatts the level immediately reduced down to about 1,000 microwatts. Later when I crept into the room again it was up at 4,400 microwatts and immediately dropped when I mentioned it verbally.

This of course has alarming ramifications if you think it through. This means that language is being monitored in real time through the remote phone system most likely by use of automatic A.I. I have been told by friends that sometimes they will comment to another person I am going to ask my Smartphone a question only to have the answer given as they recite the first word or two into the phone. It’s like the time an individual told his fiancé he was going to ask his Smartphone what day he would have to turn the clock back for the end of Daylight Savings time. As he recited the first word “when” the Smartphone recited the complete answer to him before he could even speak the question enough to understand it.

This strongly suggests real time A.I. monitoring of all speech patterns within a certain distance of the Smartphone and has alarming implications for not only A.I. base surveillance but also suggests that perhaps Dimensional wave (D-wave) quantum physics have been integrated into some Smartphones and remote phone systems.

Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi has been removed in an increasing number of public schools in Canada and Europe due to significant health concerns for children and their undeveloped neurological systems which can be more vulnerable to the harmful effects of EMF. Pulsed beam microwave transmitters were first installed in a national sporting good chain as a mind-kontrol test which was an NSA proprietary. Several managers and workers with no mental health histories suddenly and unexpectedly “cracked” and had to be taken away by paramedics. The pulsed beam microwaves had been turned up too high and some employees simply cracked from excessive EMF to their brains.

The next place these Wi-Fi systems were installed and tested was in certain select public high schools, especially the one visited by Bush2 when he was president. In one installation I monitored, this Wi-Fi was deployed as a psychotronic weapon system to make some targeted “stand up” highly moral teachers very, very sick. As an adjunct poisonous enzymes were sprayed onto the desks of certain targeted teachers. Some got cancer, some died, some cracked, some just quit. All this covered up under so-called “national security” which was invoked. Other stand up targeted teachers that survived the EMF assaults were then wrongly accused of accessing pornography websites but with no actual proof. In one particular High School where this was done, the administration was linked to Intel and was stealing million of public funds using sophisticated means while running two sets of books. Complaints to the local US Attorney with good evidence supplied and to the US Department of Education Inspector General resulted in an early retirement for the US Attorney and nothing was done in DC either.

The strategy was to drive out any teachers who had strong character and could see what was going on. Good counter-measures for those sensitive to Wi-Fi include hard wiring all computers, eliminating all Wi-Fi especially in one’s home and shielding wall if one lives in multiple dwellings where others Wi-Fi come through with strong signal strength. Wi-Fi has been known to effect some sensitive individuals and can cause the same type of behavioral and health issues that are now linked to dirty electricity, Lilly Waves and excessive EMF in general. We now know for certain that EMF does not have to heat the human cell or human tissue as we have been told for years by the CDC, the USAF and various electrical engineering departments at major Universities to entrain the brain or influence attitudes, beliefs and behaviors.

Cell phone towers: Some experts suggest maintaining a certain distance from these EMF emitters when possible. Those close by cell towers have reported sleeping difficulties, behavioral effects such as irritability, marital conflicts not there before and new unexpected health issues. Insiders have reported that these cell tower systems have been deployed as part of as massive psychotronic war against the American mind to break up relationships and families, make folks sick and to mind-kontrol by remote inductive entrainment. In my city a big mega church was built. Soon after the biggest cell phone tower with the most transmitting antennas installed on it in three levels was built. I noticed that the intensity of the EMF was strangely highest when the church services were being held. I swept the home of a suspected super soldier with an IQ of over 200 living nearby at his request and traced high EMF to the tower and a special dish installed on it aimed at his home. Another pure coincidence I’m sure. Painting and grounding walls will special EMF blocking paint available from www.lessemf.com and other vendors can be effective in reducing cell phone emissions for electro-sensitive individuals or those who are concerned about being too close to cell phone transmission towers.

—

Radar and Dopplar radar: For years medical effects were denied by the USAF and yet significant proof emerged that those airman exposed to a lot of radar had increased frequency of cataracts and certain cancers. Those too close to these emitters can use grounded screening on interior walls or special grounded EMF blocking paint. The same paint the NSA uses in their SCIFs is now available from numerous vendors like www.lessemf.com. It is fairly pricey but it is a one time expense and some believe it is worth it.

—

Ground based, vehicle based, aircraft based or satellite based microwaves and pulsed beam microwaves aimed and/or triangulated at selected targeted individuals: These systems are expensive to deploy and must be scheduled. therefore they are usually only deployed against whistleblowers or in certain experiments. The usual EMF shielding methodologies like the use of special grounded, metallized primer paints can be quite effective, except for the new X-ray lasers which require much heavier, thicker shielding.

—

Ground based ELF systems aimed and/or triangulated at certain selected individuals: These systems are usually complex working in tandem with other technologies and are deployed against whistleblowers or targeted individuals who have been randomly selected to serve as experimental controls. The talk inside deep Intel circles is that all these systems are still being calibrated and experimented with using A.I. Someday in the future it is expected that the Secret Shadow Government will integrate all this knowledge and turn over control of all the remote inductive entrainment systems to centralized A.I. control run out of the NSA Bluffdale, Utah Base, using the new world’s largest Quantum computer, Vesuvius. Obviously by now most readers have figured out that the NSA is actually run by the same soulless, unimaginably evil Plutocratic Oligarchs from the thirteen Bloodline families who are deploying this Alien ET back engineered/derived psychotronic technology to advance and manage the implementation of their age-old inter-generational Globalist NWO Agenda of pure anti-human evil.

—

Cell Phones and Smart phones: It is now apparent that many of these have real time A.I. interaction-oriented quantum based surveillance powers. Some insiders have alleged that the particular wave forms and frequencies have been designed to entrain attitudes, thought patterns and even beliefs. The jury is still out on this claim, but based on what I have seen so far it wouldn’t surprise me.

Plus there is now a big concern by medical researchers in numerous nations that holding these phones close and making contact with one’s head, like ordinary cell phones and using them too much, can perhaps cause various types of brain cancer. OJ’s attorney Johnny Cochran bragged how he got rid of one of his secretaries after he decided to do all his business by cell phone. He was on it many hours a day, held it close to his head and died of brain cancer soon after the OJ trial ended. Mere coincidence or damage caused by too much, too intense EMF?

There are several ways to mitigate this excessive EMF from Smartphones, just like with ordinary cell phones. Talking with the phone at least 4-6 inches from ones head, use of certain styles of remote earphones, air powered the best, or the use of the speaker phone, ,or use of special fabric pockets which block radiation to the head while talking but still allow the phone to work.

Note: In European health studies by MDs, 3-6% of the populace has been shown to have altered EKGs and EEGs. In at least one Scandinavian nation, EMF sensitivity is a recognized medical disability and a sanctuary city has been set up with highly reduced EMF emissions for those so designated to live in.

Ultra high tech psychotronics, remote mental induction and quantum-based surveillance are the new weapons of war being waged covertly against mankind by the International Satanic Pedophile Network (Ruling Cabal) through the Deep Black unacknowledged, special access Intel cell deeply buried within certain Defense Contractors.

Most of those working on these projects are so compartmented by “Need to Know” that few understand how these devastating weapons of war are being deployed to mind-kontrol and sicken many Americans. Those that do, who sit at the top of the pyramid or run these special access programs, are criminal sociopaths that lost their souls long ago, and most have been initiated into the Satanic Pedophile Network (Ruling Cabal) that runs most of the world.

Now for the difficult conclusion to all this. All MK-Ultra sleeper violence in America (including the real mass-shootings in gun-free zones), and all Radical Islamic violence (ISIS type mercenary forces) are created, paid for, trained, supplied and energized and activated by orders and authorization of the Ruling Cabal. Many so-called radical Islamic mercenaries are not really followers of Islam at all, but have been raised in special camps for abandoned children, mind-kontrolled through drugs, trauma-conditioning and psychotronics at an early age. They, as well as other paid mercenaries, are mind-kontrolled and inducted with psychotic belief patterns that make them easy for the Cabal to remotely activate. They can thus be transformed into savage torturers, heartless rapists and murderers of innocent men, women and children — all done to deliver blood sacrifices to Satan on behalf of the Ruling Cabal to provide them more power as promised by Satan (their words not mine).

Sadly, it’s a fact that many current social movements are by-products of Bernays-type, Madison Avenue social modeling, cultural Mind-kontrol, as well as ultra high tech remote inductive technologies that entrain the human brain and generate synthetic belief patterns and attitudes which cause individuals to acts in ways contrary to their own long term best interests. At little as five years ago, to even discuss these subjects publicly usually resulted in termination as an immediate sanction. Thanks to the Internet and hundreds of honest Intel and LE individuals who refused to keep quiet about these inhuman crimes, the public can now have access to this information, if they so desire. And more and more folks want to know why they are having trouble sleeping, are tired too much, have difficulty concentrating and feel off kilter.



The Cabal’s Plan is part of the Globalist NWO Agenda of Evil to keep experimenting and fine tuning these technologies separately to spy on Americans while mind-controlling them at the same time. Without these devices such as smart phones and Wi-Fi providing desirable features of convenience, few would use them, and the Cabal would not be able to fine tune these technologies.

Once the fine tuning is complete, the Cabal has planned to combine them under control of a massive Quantum computer using A.I. automatic controls and operating through inter-dimensional wave forms. At this point, they believe they will be able to make whole populations completely mind-kontrolled and cloned/hived to the mother A.I. computer; or make sick or even murder whole human populations at will. Then they plan to eliminate 90% of all humans and replace them with their own synthetic race of hybrids, a combination of clay and iron (biology and manufactured electrical components).

Looks like the Cabal has been having some recent bumps in the road with the unexpected side effects of the Internet which has turned out to be the New Gutenberg Press and is now undermining the New Roman Empire run out of the Vatican, which was hijacked by the Black Pope and the Old Black Nobility long ago, the folks that really run the Ruling Cabal. When the Gutenberg Press appeared, it undermined the Vatican by making the Bible available to all — something the Vatican desperately wanted to prevent.

Right now populism has emerged inside America and much of the western world and is growing in power by the day. If not stopped this will be the death of the Cabal’s Globalist NWO efforts.

Never forget — all these various types of Mind-kontrol through these Satanic Black Arts and back-engineered Alien ET technologies do not work well on folks with strong character, integrity and love in their hearts for their fellow man, who have decided to live by the golden rule to treat others the way they want to be treated. It is this immutable human spirit, energized by love towards others, that poses the greatest risk to the Ruling cabal, and cannot ever be snuffed out. I am pretty certain the Cabal will eventually be defanged and stopped and will lose control over these weapons before they can combine them and succeed in their Globalist NWO Agenda of Evil.

233,"MSNBC’s Joy Reid: Trump's Base is a 'Cult' of 'White Evangelicals' That Worship Him

Host labels Trump supporters as 'cult' like followers of president

MSNBC host Joy Reid said during a segment on “AM Joy” on Saturday that support for President Donald Trump is like a “cult,” which is ""solidly among the white evangelicals.""

Reid's remarks came in response to a recent poll that suggested that some Republicans believe Trump is a better president than Abraham Lincoln.

“There’s a lot of ways if you look at like the Public Religion Research Institute numbers that, you know, it isn’t just a pejorative to say that it’s a cult,” Reid said.

“There’s a lot of evidence that is a racial and religious cult of personality, in which his base is solidly among the white evangelicals that almost worship him and say that he’s the chosen one of God.”

Reid has frequently attacked Trump since he took the White House in 2016.

In 2017, the host claimed the Trump era was the “worst time to be a human.""

“I’ve said to people that this is probably the greatest time to be a journalist, and the worst time to be a human,” she said.

In September, she also caused a backlash for claiming that white Christians may turn the United States into a South Africa-like apartheid state.

“When you have a very determined minority, in this case wealthy white men and wealthy white Christian men and Christian Americans who are of the fundamentals variety, who are very clear that no matter what happens if they have to pull the South Africa model to maintain power forever they will do it, and they’re not afraid of it and they’re increasingly open about it and Donald Trump is merely the avatar for this,” she said.

In August, MSNBC gave airtime to one of its analysts to promote a bizarre conspiracy theory claiming Trump is sending ""subliminal orders"" to racists to carry out mass shootings.

National security analyst Malcolm Nance made the wild claims while appearing on MSNBC’s Hardball with host Chris Matthews.

Nance seemingly suggested that white supremacist “foot soldiers” are being brainwashed, somehow, by the words of President Trump as “subliminal orders in their head.”

""This country has had several of these mass incidents, but I think we’re overdue for a Breivik-style real massacre of a political nature…

""These people feel that they are the foot soldiers and executors of what the disenfranchisement that the white race is feeling, and Donald Trump is giving them subliminal orders in their head.

""They are no different than the mobilized, self-starting, self-radicalized terrorists of ISIS here in the United States and Europe, who take cars and drive down streets.""It’s just that they have a permissive environment in which they can get firearms and go out and attack their perceived enemies.""

1209,"Bigfoot is famously elusive in real life, an in the world of Grand Theft Auto, he's similarly hard to find. But, thanks to one kind-hearted Redditer, finding Bigfoot – or rather, transforming into him – just became a little easier.

The breadcrumbs for this mythical bear hunt were laid last week, when Rockstar Games added Cryptozoologist, a new achievement that is awarded to players once they have unlocked all the animals in GTA V movie editor.

But something was amiss: when you get the animal actors menu, the player is shown as only having 21 out of a possible 22. This is because there is another creature to unlock, and that creature is Bigfoot.

Aside from being able to drive cars, fire guns and be generally more entertaining, Bigfoot is similar to other animals in that the player has to eat hidden peyote plants. To become Bigfoot, the peyote plant is gold, and particularly difficult to find.

Redditer rkRusty delved into the code for the PC version of GTA V to find the exact locations of the plants and what makes them appear.

From this, they established that the golden (Bigfoot) peyote plant appears if you play the game at dawn on a Tuesday while the weather is foggy on a PC, or snowing if you're playing on XBox One and Playstation 4, at the following coordinates: 1472.531, 4439.456, 18.862

From then, you see the character pass out, hallucinate and transform into Bigfoot.

Unfortunately, you also have to have eaten all the other 27 peyote plants and complete ""The Last One"" mission without killing the Sasquatch. After that, feel free to terrorise away - and make the most of it, you only get one go as Bigfoot before vomiting it all up like a bad dream.",mainstream
690,"Milton has named Rodney Wedig as its football coach, Milton athletic and activities director Brian Hammil said Friday.

Wedig stepped down as Beloit Memorial football coach in November.

Milton of the Badger South Conference had an opening after Matt Lee resigned following the season.

“When I stepped down from Beloit Memorial, I had originally planned to step back for a year but when this opportunity presented itself at Milton I couldn’t resist it,” Wedig said Friday in an email to the State Journal. “They have a great football tradition and play in a conference with some of the top teams in the state.

“I feel like this is a program that can compete for championships and that was a big reason I decided to take the job.”

Wedig coached five seasons at Beloit Memorial after a successful tenure at Walworth Big Foot, including winning the WIAA Division 4 state title in 2009 and finishing second in Division 4 in 2008 and 2012.

Beloit Memorial finished 2-7 this past season. After seeing progress, Wedig said before the season he was hoping this would be a breakthrough and potentially playoff season for the Purple Knights. But the season disappointed Wedig, 6-41 in his five seasons at Beloit Memorial.

As a head coach, Wedig holds a 147-107 record. He was coach at Almond-Bancroft for eight years and Big Foot for 11.

Wedig’s son, Matthew Wedig, was a standout tight end, linebacker and punter for Beloit Memorial. Matthew Wedig, a senior, has signed with Illinois State for football.

Milton finished 3-6 overall and 2-5 in the Badger South this past fall. Monona Grove was the conference winner and Milton tied with Monroe and Madison Edgewood for fifth place.

Lee took over in 2016, replacing Bill O’Leary. Milton was 3-6 in 2016 and 3-6 in 2017, giving Lee a 9-18 mark.

Milton hired Rodney Wedig after a lengthy, nationwide search of well-qualified candidates in the offseason, according to a release from the school.

In his career, Wedig led Almond Bancroft’s football team to their first conference title in 2002 and, while coaching Big Foot, was instrumental in putting together a record of 56-6 during his last five years. His tenure at Big Foot included a streak of 48 consecutive conference victories, 11 straight playoff appearances, the two WIAA state runner-up finishes and one WIAA state championship.

“While we had a lot of great candidates apply for the position, Rodney’s depth of head coaching experience, success, enthusiasm for coaching kids and his love of football set him apart,” Hammil said in the release. “I’m excited to have him get started and get to work with our great group of student-athletes.”

In the release, Wedig said: “It is an honor to be selected to be Milton’s next head football coach. I’m excited to meet our players and their families and get to work. I’ve heard great things about the community and the football program and I look forward to leading in a community that has such a strong tradition of great football.”",mainstream
900,"""All in all a decent experience but had we paid more than the $10 I would have been disappointed,"" Winchester said in his review. He wrote about spending five to 10 minutes feeding the cattle at the beginning of the tour and seeing ""maybe 10 of the cows.""

""I have significant reservations regarding any business run by someone who seems to think it is an acceptable business practice to contact family members and associates of a reviewer because they seem to be unhappy with a review,"" he said.

Bigfoot on the Strip filed a lawsuit in Taney County on April 13 against both Winchesters as well as their family business, Dancing Cow Farms, located in Douglas County, Kansas. The suit has since been moved to federal court. Bigfoot on the Strip called Winchester's statements ""false and defamatory."" The business is suing for libel, negligence and tortious interference.

The lawsuit alleges that Randy and Emily Winchester did not take the tour and did not pay $10 to take the tour. Tour tickets cost nearly $40 for an adult and almost $30 for a child or about $100 for a family pass, according to court documents.

The only other one-star review left by Winchester was for Joe's Crab Shack in Olathe, Kansas, which is now closed: ""Overprices (sic), terrible food. Fish is dry, crab legs and lobster overcooked, corn on cob is tough. Overall flavor of most food there is just poor. I go here because my 4 and 6 year old grand daughters like to go on their birthdays.""

""This is a pretty mild review,"" Levy said of Randy Winchester's post on TripAdvisor. ""They gave it three stars out of five (initially). They said it was okay, not worth more than they paid for it, which is an opinion.""

Levy said that if there are ""really serious false statements"" in a review, it's up to the business to decide whether it's worth a lawsuit. However, the suit by Bigfoot on the Strip left him with many questions.

""It strikes me as a very peculiar lawsuit,"" Levy said. ""It's hard to imagine why this would be a sensible business strategy for a small business, unless there is something beyond what meets the eye going on here.""

""We did the Bigfoot Safari tour as part of a large group. The $10 price tag is about right for what we got. Basically a tour through some pretty rugged country on some pretty narrow roads. They promote the fact they have the largest herd of Highland cows in the Midwest. You spend about 5-10 minutes feeding them range cubes at the beginning of the tour, and see maybe 10 of the cows. Then it’s off into the hills you go with a guide telling some pretty fanciful tales along the way. All in all a decent experience but had we paid more than the $10 I would have been disappointed.

 

 ""Since posting the above review, a person identifying himself as an owner of Bigfoot on the Strip has called my daughter on her cellphone repeatedly, has contacted my daughter by email, has tried to call my home phone at 8:30 p.m. on a Saturday, has attempted to contact me by email, and has contacted the person who coordinated our tour, to complain about my original review. The 'owner' has also advised my daughter by email that he and his partners would likely be suing both of us.

998,"“When I first saw it, I said, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me,’” Madsen recalled. But there was no mistaking the image. He and his colleague, Dewayne A. Fox of Delaware State University, have extensively used this sonar system in sturgeon habitat elsewhere along the Atlantic Coast and in the Republic of Georgia, home to half a dozen species of sturgeon, all deeply endangered, including Huso huso, which can reach lengths of 18 feet and is the source of Beluga caviar.

This rhythm is easy to track in New York Times stories through that stretch. An August 1881 item used the term of the day, “Albany beef,” to describe heavy demand for sturgeon meat: “In former years the catch of the sturgeon in the Hudson River was amply sufficient to supply all demands for the beef at low prices. Within the past few years, however, the fish have become scarce and shy.”

In the Hudson, the sign of trouble was a sharp drop in the abundance of the youngest fish, which would wander into shad nets every spring (and be released). One shad fisherman, Bob Gabrielson, visibly upset by this, told me how the armor-like knobbly “scutes” along the bodies of the youngest fish, not yet dulled by wear and tear, gleamed like hammered silver. “They’re the most beautiful thing in the world,” Gabrielson said.

The discovery of a sturgeon so large in the river I’ve lived along, and reported on, since 1991 deeply excited me. This was particularly the case because, in 2010, I’d been out on the Hudson with Higgs and other state biologists doing the tagging study and videotaped the scene as they hauled a seven-foot, 120-pound male sturgeon onto their 21-foot boat to measure and inspect.

To widen the view of this sonar signal, I turned first to John Cronin, an old friend who’s encountered the Hudson and its biological bounty in more ways than anyone I know. His four-decade-plus career along the Hudson has included commercial fishing for shad (a species now greatly depleted from the river), patrolling for pollution as the Hudson Riverkeeper and teaching environmental policy at nearby Pace University.

The loss is not just of fish but of the relationship communities have with their environment when fisheries are sustainable, Cronin said. He lamented how mismanagement of harvests, even when the science was clear, led to the final crash in the 1990s and then a ban on catches that will persist for many years, if not decades, to come.",mainstream
783,"Believers theorize that he came down from Mt. Hood, the 14,000-foot blizzard-shrouded peak just outside Portland, Oregon. Massive, standing nearly nine feet tall and weighing all of 900 pounds, he strode down the wooded ridges, north and east to the 7,000-foot level where the spring snow lay wet and heavy in forests 50 miles from the nearest road. At the 4,000-foot level, the thick coniferous forests thinned and the deep mountain gorges leveled out. It was late June, 1971, and the lower rivers raged with the waters of the melting snow pack.

At the 3,000-foot level the first growths of douglas fir and oak gave way to a few scrub oak, growing singly. From a high point on the ridge that runs down from Mt. Hood called Seven Mile Hill, he could see the lights of The Dalles, Oregon, where 11,000 people lived.

Fifteen miles upriver the Wy-am Indians, roped to their platforms perched over the boiling river, netted spring chinook salmon by the hundreds with their long poles. This they had done every spring since prehistory. The Great Food is what the Wy-am call salmon; and perhaps he had come down to the semi-arid insecurity of The Dalles to scramble on the banks of the river for the Great Food during one of the largest salmon runs on the North American Continent. Some who theorize about him think that he came down to this narrow point in the river where there is little current because an island breaks the swim to Washington and the Cascade Range—where the deer and huckleberries are plentiful in the summer.

East the land opens to treeless rolling hills. Great high-tension towers converge on the Chenowith Converter and scar the land as far as the eye can see. There was no cover for him there. But to swim the river from here, four miles west of The Dalles, he had only to cross two roads: the old highway to Portland, US 30, and the new Interstate, 80N.

Things had changed since he had last been down to the river. There was an aluminum plant nearby, a new shopping center, a Rocket gas station, a new and used car lot, and—strangest of all for him during the nights—The Dalles drive-in which specializes in films like Deathmaster and The Two-Headed Thing. In the early daylight hours of this first day of June, 1971, he stood in a small meadow above what had been a large foothill apple orchard. It was now filled with flat electrified platforms and called The Pinewood Mobile Manor.

Joe Mederios, maintenance man for the trailer court, was watering flowers near his trailer that morning. Directly across US 30 is a large fenced meadow. At about 150 yards a rocky ledge of perhaps 35 feet banks a higher meadow. Mederios caught a movement along the ledge from a corner of his eye. He assumed it was George Johnson, the owner of the land, and went back to watering his flowers. But his mind was engaged in a curious and unconscious arithmetic. He had seen Johnson on the land previously—it wasn’t unusual—but this figure was too big … the arms were too long … the shoulders too broad.

Mederios turned to the ridge for a longer look. What he saw was a shaggy, gray figure he took to be at least ten feet tall. It had an oval face and a crest or dorsal ridge along the top of its head. The face was flat, brown and hairless.

The man turned back to his flowers and considered his situation. He was responsible to some Portland businessmen who would be down to The Dalles the next day. If he were to report the sighting, there would be deputies and curiosity-seekers tromping all over his carefully watered flowers about the time his bosses arrived. Mederios later told Sheriff’s deputy Rich Carlson that he didn’t report the incident for fear he’d “be called a nut.”

The next day, around noon, the three businessmen met Mederios and were in the midst of discussions in a trailer office fronting the meadow when Mederios again saw an erect ape-like figure through a window. The four men ran outside and watched from across the road as it moved through a break in the ridge and came into the lower meadow where it walked among the sparse scrub oak near the rocks. It stopped near a small tree, and from where the men stood, it appeared to be somewhat taller than the tree. The four men and the other creature stared at one another for perhaps a minute, before it turned, went up through the break in the rocks and disappeared into the upper meadow.

This time the sighting was reported and deputy Carlson went out to investigate.

From Carlson’s report filed on June 2nd, ’71: “Mr. Mederios … described it as being about ten feet tall, greyish in color, real wide shoulders and arms that hung way down. He went on to say it looked like an overgrown ape. He stated it was not a bear. The creature was walking upright at the time of the sighting.”

The Portland men, solid citizens all, confirmed the sighting and description.

The same night, about 9:30, when the last summer light was fading in the meadow, a man named Rich Brown, a high-school music teacher, and his wife were returning from a choir practice he had been conducting. At the entrance to the trailer court, Brown’s wife either shouted or screamed and pointed to a figure in the lower meadow. Brown swung his car around and put the headlights stark into the meadow. He was joined by a second car, and eventually Mederios, who stepped out of the office to see why the cars were blocking the entrance.

At a distance of about 65 yards the creature froze and stared into the lights. Brown sprinted for his trailer, grabbed a Winchester 30.06 with a four-power scope. He opened his car door and steadied the rifle. He considered a shot at the heart, then the head. With the scope cross-hairs squarely between the thing’s expressionless flat black eyes, he released the safety. Like any good marksman, Brown squeezes the trigger slowly. In the moment between the final squeeze and the shot, Rich Brown, who had just come from a church, made a complicated moral decision.

“I couldn’t shoot it,” he said later, “because it looked more human than animal.”

Aside from Indian legends, which are virtually timeless, the Bigfoot saga on the North American Continent begins in 1811 when the explorer David Thompson noted in his daily journal the track of “a large animal … the whole is about 14 inches by eight inches wide,” in the Canadian Rockies by the site of what is now Jasper, Alberta. Several months later Thompson found similar tracks which he followed for nearly 100 yards. “Reports from the old times,” he noted offhandedly, “had made the head branches of this river and the mountains in the vicinity the abode of apes or more very large animals.”

In July of 1884, a Victoria, British Columbia, newspaper, the Daily Colonist, published an account of the capture of a gorilla-type animal the miners called Jacko. About 4’7″ tall and weighing about 125 pounds, the animal may have been a young Bigfoot. No other mention can be found of Jacko in the Daily Colonist.

The Seattle Times reported a series of bizarre great ape sightings around Mt. St. Lawrence near Kelso, Washington, in July of 1918. In 1924, a group of miners camped near Mt. St. Helen in Washington claimed a horde of giant ape-like creatures attacked them in the middle of the night. One was shot and rolled into a deep canyon which is known today as Ape Canyon. Also in 1924, a prospector named Albert Ostman claimed that while camping near Vancouver he was picked up in his sleeping bag and carried 25 miles by a giant hairy ape. They arrived in a sheltered valley where he was curiously observed for several days by a family of four Bigfeet. He eventually fed them chewing tobacco and escaped while they were sick.

In 1940, the Chapmans, an Amerindian Indian family living near the Fraser River in British Columbia, claimed a giant hairy ape walked out of the woods and turned over a massive barrel of salt fish in the shed. Footprints were left and local residents reported, they were 16 inches long and eight inches wide. The stride length was about four feet. Mrs. Chapman said the creature was about eight feet tall.

American sightings made national headlines in the Bluff Creek area of Northern California in October of 1958. On the ninth of that month, the Humboldt Times reported that Jerry Crew, a road builder for the Granite Logging Company, made a cast of a huge footprint—16 inches long—he found on the damp bed of a newly built lumbering access road. The stride was 50 inches long, he said, and ran along the road for a distance of about three quarters of a mile.

Five days later two construction workers for the same company were driving along a remote mountain road late at night when they saw what they took to be the owner of the prints. Ray Kerr, then 43, said, “it ran upright like a man, swinging long hairy arms … it looked eight to ten feet tall to me.” Tracks found the next morning were identical to the first set.

Interviewed in the Humboldt Times, Ray Wallace, a partner in the logging firm, denied that he had perpetrated a hoax. “Who knows anyone foolish enough to ruin their own business,” he said. Fifteen men had quit their jobs since the sightings. Workers reported that they saw nothing during the day but that every morning they found huge and apparently curious prints around the equipment. Huge gasoline drums had been turned over. Some workers had the uncomfortable sensation that they were being watched during the day. “I’ve got three tractors up there without operators, man,” Wallace complained. “And all my brush-cutting crew has quit.”

Dr. Maurice Tripp, a geophysicist from Los Gatos, California, made casts of the prints which proved that the toes showed mechanical function. After studying the soil and the depth of the print, Tripp estimated the probable creature’s weight at 800 pounds. None of his casts showed impact ridges which would have indicated that they were made by some kind of mechanical stomping machine.

Another series of prints, 1,089 in all, were discovered near Bossberg, Washington, in October of 1969. The tracks measured 17½” x 7″. The right foot seemed to be twisted inwards and calluses on the outside of the foot and the extrapolated bone structure indicated the creature who made the prints had a clubfoot. Dr. Grover Krantz, a physical anthropologist at Washington State University, studied casts of the Bossberg prints and concluded that if the tracks were hoaxed, the fakers were “absolute experts in human anatomy.”

Since the ’58 Bluff Creek sightings, hundreds more have been recorded, some less credible than others. While Albert Ostman only claimed to have been kidnapped by Bigfeet, one Helen Westring confessed, right on the front page of the National Bulletin (July, 1969), I WAS RAPED BY AN ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN. Seems that while Helen was out hunting one day in the Minnesota woods she was attacked by a giant horny ape who stripped her of her flimsy clothes in a thrice and had his hairy way with her right there on the mute forest loam.

There are many men hunting Bigfoot on a more or less regular basis, and one of the most impressive is a 46-year-old, Dublin-born former big-game hunter named Peter Byrne. Financed by Ohio businessman Tom Page and several others who wish to remain anonymous, Byrne has one paid assistant, two young volunteers, two International Scout jeeps, a pickup truck, a helicopter on 24-hour notice, and a plethora of equipment including infrared night-scopes and sophisticated tranquilizer guns.

Byrne, who does not take a salary from expedition funds but lives off his own income, has a Hemingwayesque history. In World War II he flew for the RAF, and subsequently ended up as assistant manager of a tea plantation in Nepal. He once effected the rescue of an Everest expedition stranded by an avalanche at the 20,000-foot level. For 15 years he led big-game hunts in Africa.

In 1968, with the game thinning out (more from poachers than hunters), Byrne wearied of leading bumbling clients through the brush and pointing them at the animals he had come to respect. He organized the nonprofit International Wildlife Conservation Society. As executive director, Byrne spent two years creating two large tiger sanctuaries in Nepal. The project was completed in November of 1970.

While in Nepal, Byrne had become fascinated with the legend of the Yeti (the perhaps mythical Abominable Snowman, cousin to the perhaps mythical Bigfoot). He disputed the findings of Sir Edmund Hillary’s 1960 Yeti hunting expedition, insisting that a month search didn’t constitute a real effort to find the beast. The Yeti scalp Hillary took from a Tibetan monastery had been analyzed as a goat-and antelope-hair fabrication, proving, to Hillary’s satisfaction, that none of the sacred Yeti relics in any of the monasteries were authentic. Byrne felt that the scalp Hillary found was a copy of an original he never saw. Byrne himself had visited half a dozen of the monasteries and in one secretly cut the thumb from a mummified hand. He wired a mummified human thumb to the palm and sent the relic to scientists in Paris, then London, then the United States. In all cases the scientists came up with the inconclusive conclusion that the thumb was not human, that it was animal, and that further, it was unclassifiable.

In the Himalayas, only two Europeans have claimed Yeti sightings. Byrne, fascinated with the hypothetical creatures to a point just short of obsession, knew that there were hundreds of sightings in the Pacific Northwest. In 1971 he organized the present three-year search. He has, to date, logged hundreds of thousands of miles on the jeeps, interviewed hundreds of claimants, talked at length to the Indians about their legends and knowledge of the apes, and camped in the woods in various sighting areas nearly a year’s worth of elapsed time. Byrne regards as his strongest piece of evidence an 18-second piece of film taken by one Roger Patterson near Bluff Creek in the early afternoon hours of October 7th, 1967.

Patterson, a small rancher and weekend Bigfoot hunter from Yakima, Washington, had spent four years and thousands of dollars on his search. He claims to have been on horseback in the Bluff Creek area with Bob Gimlin, his tracker, when they caught sight of a female Bigfoot crouched by a stream. Patterson’s horse spooked and nearly threw him. He pulled his camera from his saddlebag and ran toward the creature, trying to focus simultaneously.

The 16mm color film begins with a wild, jerking view of the manzanita underbrush. The camera steadies, pans right, and focuses in on an erect, apelike figure which appears to be about 30 feet away. It walks, at a slight angle to camera, into a thickly wooded area and disappears. It turns once toward the camera and its face shows large black eyes, a small nose, a massive jaw, and a crest or ridge on the head. Muscle movement can be seen in the upper right thigh. When the right arm swings back, large, hair-covered breasts become visible.

Patterson, apparently anxious to validate his film, took a lie detector test which he passed. He submitted the film to the Smithsonian’s director of primate biology, John Napier (now visiting professor of primate biology at the University of London), who has expressed his doubts in the recently published book Bigfoot.

The walk seems to Napier “self-consciously” fluid. The stride is essentially that of a human male while the filmed creature is female. The crest is a male feature on orangutans and gorillas, seldom seen in females. The heavy buttocks seen in the Patterson film are a human feature, out of place on the apelike superstructure. Furthermore, the 14″ x 7″ prints—on a human scale—would indicate a creature nearly eight feet tall while both Byrne and Napier have estimated the height of the Patterson creature at about 6’6″. Napier concludes his discussion of the film by saying that he won’t proclaim it a hoax almost solely because, “I cannot see the zipper.”

Byrne respectfully disagrees. “Napier is using human formulas to deal with an unknown quantity,” he says.

Byrne published the results of a year’s investigation in the prestigious Explorers Journal. His case for the existence of the Giant Apes (which he calls Omah, after the local Indians), briefly and inadequately summarized, is as follows:

1). There are hundreds of thousands of virtually unexplored and roadless wilderness areas in the Pacific Northwest. The habitat of the Omah might be in the steep, thickly wooded gorges of this region.

2). These same areas support black and brown bear. If the Omah were an omnivore, with a diet roughly similar to that of a bear, the forests could easily support a small Omah population.

3). There have been few sightings, because like most primates, the Omah is wary of man. (First reports of African gorillas in the early 17th century were treated as folklore. Not until the middle of the 19th century did Europeans succeed in tracking down the shy beasts.)

Byrne does not speculate on the origin of Omah, though when pressed he will mention the fossil remains of a Chinese primate anthropologists call Gigantopithecus. “Its estimated height was between ten and 12 feet and the fossils were discovered in an area of China scientists think provided the native American population, the Eskimos and the Indians.” The theory, of course, is that nomadic tribes migrated across the frozen Bering Strait. “A case, I think, can be made for Gigantopithecus as an ancestor to Omah,” Byrne says.

Currently living in a trailer in The Dalles, Byrne is still deeply involved in the hunt. If he should come on one of the animals, he plans to dart it and keep it subdued for several days. A team of scientists have agreed to fly in at any time at his expense. They would land in Portland and helicopter to the site. There they would take photos, measurements, urine, stool and blood samples. The Omah would then be set free.

I asked if a tranquilizer capable of bringing down a beast that could conceivably weigh up to 1,000 pounds wouldn’t kill a man hoaxed up in a gorilla suit.

“No,” Byrne says, and adds wryly: “Unfortunately, the safety margin is quite high. The drug has been tested on volunteer prisoners. It simply puts a man under for quite a long period without harming him. You can, however, quote me as saying I would be delighted to put a dart in the ass of any jerk wearing a fur suit for my benefit.”

I am indebted to Sgt. Jack Robertson of The Dalles Sheriff’s department for a bit of woodsy Omah lore.

“If you should be out in the woods without a weapon,” he said, “and you see Bigfoot, just throw some crap in his face and he’ll run away. They hate that.”

“What am I going to do if there isn’t any crap around?”

“Listen,” Robertson said, “if you’re out in the woods alone and you see him, there’ll be plenty of crap around.”

Flora Thompson is 74 years old, a Wy-am Indian who lives at Celilo Falls, the prime salmon netting spot on the Columbia River, which her tribe calls “Wauna.” Flora studied and learned the legends of the Wy-am from her late husband, the great chief Tommy Thompson, who died at 108 in 1951. She can tell about the time before men when all the animals were people and were giants. Coyote was the Changer. He dug a trench from the great eastern lake to the ocean so the salmon could swim upstream. In this way Coyote made the earth fit for man.

In the Changing Time, just after there were men, there was another beast. As Flora Thompson describes it, it is very much like the Omah in the Patterson film. It was a female and its name was Tlat-ta-chee-ah.

“We use Tlat-ta-chee-ah as a scarecrow,” Flora says. “We tell the bad children that she will come to eat them if they don’t behave.”

The Wy-am are not the only tribe that have legends about giant, ape-like creatures. Many tribes call him Sasquatch.

In British Columbia, the Salish call him Stwanitie. The Quamault of the Olympic Peninsula call him Seeakwa. In Alberta he is called Tsonqua and Ghaga, and in Northern California, the Hoopa call him Kadonkwa. In the Central Pacific Northwest many tribes call him Omah.

Peter Byrne in his investigation has talked to many of the tribes in the general sighting areas. Two elderly Indians on the Colville reservation located in Northeastern Washington told him that their grandfathers spoke of seeing up to 20 Omah catching salmon during run on the Columbia River. In the 1850s, they said, the Omah caught the white man’s disease and died.

Another legend prevalent in the Northwest is that there were once many Omah and they lived not only in the forests, but also far to the south and in the plains of the east. The Indians warred with them, and by the time the white man came, they were all gone.

Item: At twilight in a small mountain town in Northern California, a clerk in the general store thought she saw a large, hair-covered animal she took to be Bigfoot. Within an hour a large armed crowd had gathered in front of the store, ready to hunt the beast. Investigation showed that the beast was actually a prankster, a high-school boy who had thrown a fur over his head.

From a letter to Deputy Carlson, dated November 25th, 1972: “I believe from reading the article about the Bigfoot search that it is a man dressed in a gorilla suit so people do not kill him, he is probably getting a big kick out of doing his thing, scaring people. The article said it looked like a man. That’s what it was—a man—in costume. If you attend a Halloween dance in costume in Los Angeles you would see plenty of Yeti, dancing with the girls. I’ve seen plenty of these outfits, so do not shoot him, he’s having fun.”

Excerpt from a conversation with a deputy sheriff in The Dalles, Oregon: “Now I’m not saying that a critter like that actually exists. I’ve been hunting this part of the country for almost 20 years, and I’ve never seen hide nor hair of one. But if I did see one, you damn betcha it’s a dead one. It’d be worth more to you alive, but even a dead one would bring you a million for a squeeze of the trigger. And how would you capture one? You couldn’t, is all. Shoot it, is the best way. You’d have a million. I wouldn’t even come to work tomorrow if I shot one tonight. I’d just sit back and start counting my money.”

Sections of County Ordinance 69-01 Skamania County, Washington (located just across the river from The Dalles): “Prohibiting wanton slaying of apecreatures and imposing penalties.

“WHEREAS, there is evidence to indicate the possible existence in Skamania County of a nocturnal primate mammal variously described as an apelike creature or a sub-species of homo sapiens, and

“WHEREAS, both legend and purported recent sightings and spoor support the possibility, and

“WHEREAS, this creature is generally and commonly known as ‘Sasquatch,’ or ‘Yeti’ or ‘Giant Hairy Ape,’ and

“WHEREAS, publicity attendant on such real or imagined sightings has resulted in an influx of scientific investigators as well as casual hunters, many armed with lethal weapons,

“THEREFORE, let it be resolved that any premeditated, willful and wanton slaying of any such creature shall be deemed a felony punishable by a fine not to exceed ten thousand dollars and/or imprisonment in the county jail for a period not to exceed five years.”

This ordinance was adopted in the spring of 1969. On the first day of April to be exact.

Excerpt from a conversation with The Dalles deputy Rich Carlson: “There are always fellows who go out to shoot it. There are people who said they would shoot it if they saw it. In the beginning, one sighting we had, the townspeople found out about it, and by jiminy, they went up there with rifles, ready to hunt it down ….”

Undoubtedly there have been many hoaxes in the Bigfoot saga. In 1968 a Mr. Ray Pickens of Colville, Washington, strapped a pair of 16″, foot-like plywood boards to his feet and tromped over the nearby woods. A small crowd gathered and a photo was sent to Peter Byrne, who dismissed the tracks as obvious fakes. Pickens later admitted the hoax. John Napier states in his book: “I have in my files photographs of a further set of tracks which were clearly made by a hinged wooden contraption which wouldn’t fool the village idiot.”

Another citizen of Colville, the Bigfoot hunter Ivan Marx, made a series of phone calls one night in October of 1970. He was in a state of high excitement. A wounded Bigfoot had been sighted near Colville, and in the morning he was going to go out after it with his camera. As might be expected, a crowd gathered and Marx stayed in radio contact with them. At one point he claimed to have sighted the beast and some minutes later said he was actually filming it.

Peter Byrne said Marx offered to sell the film to Byrne’s organization for $25,000. He agreed to buy on the condition that the film could be studied first for signs of a hoax. Byrne says his study showed that the film had been shot about a month previous to the date Marx claimed and that it had been shot in an entirely different area than that claimed by Marx. Armed with this information, Byrne, the sheriff, and some concerned citizens made a visit to Marx’ Colville home. Marx was gone and there was no forwarding address.

He resurfaced a few weeks ago on the television show You Asked for It. He had shot a film, he said, of a large Bigfoot in a snowstorm and had come to You Asked for It, because he was impressed by the show’s reputation. To my layman’s eyes, the film seems an incredibly clumsy fake. Peter Byrne said it was “ridiculous.” In it, the creature is seen white in a heavy snowfall. It walks manlike, toward the camera, jumps around aimlessly, and gives us a view of his front and back sides. The white gorilla suit bags and wrinkles in the ass.

Most of the known hoaxers seem to be motivated by money, by a desire for notoriety, and by the desire to put one over on everybody, especially the bright boys, the scientists. Journalists, as everyone knows, are beyond these considerations. Through perseverance and knowledge of human nature, I personally obtained an exclusive interview with Bigfoot.

I had put notes up in the local supermarkets and laundromats asking anyone with Bigfoot information to call me at the Oregon Motel in The Dalles. About one AM on a dark and stormy night, I received a call. A hoarse voice with a heavy accent I couldn’t identify asked me if I was the writer who wanted to talk to Bigfoot. I said I was. The voice said, “I am Omah.” He stretched it out, “Ohhhh-mahhhh.” He said he would meet me in 20 minutes at the local Denny’s 24-hour coffee shop. He said I would recognize him because he would wear an ankle-length trench coat and a slouch hat, and because he would be nine feet tall. I suggested he carry a basketball so as not to attract attention.

I dressed quickly and doused my face with cold water. The restaurant was one of those bits of roadside formica with zippy muzak and menopausal waitresses on mother goose shoes. Two truckdrivers discussed Peterbilt rigs near the door. Omah sat in the rear, hunched over a cup of coffee, the hat pulled low over his forehead.

He looked up quickly, almost angrily as I approached the table.

“So why did you call me?” I asked.

He wanted to know if I had done any interviews and what my approach to the story was going to be. I said that I saw him as a survivor, a self-reliant primitive in the midst of vast technocracy; a pleasant reminder that we haven’t yet swallowed up all our wilderness. I said that I saw him as man’s closest brother on the earth and that by knowing him, we could certainly learn to know ourselves the better.

Omah nodded absent-mindedly while I spoke. He called the waitress over and ordered five Lumberjack Breakfasts: “A stack of delicious buckwheat cakes with rich creamery butter and Vermont maple syrup, mounds of hash browns, a giant slab of Canadian bacon, golden brown toast and an assortment of the finest jams; a breakfast fit for a lumberjack.”

While he ate, I pumped him with questions. He had been coming down to The Dalles from Fort Hood every spring for years to raid the apple orchard that is now The Pinewood Mobile Manor. One fateful June, five years ago, he found the orchard gone. In his confusion, he had come on The Dalles Drive-in, which at the time was playing Planet of the Apes. He watched the film three times every night for two weeks. He learned to speak English. And an unshakable idea grew in his mind. Through the long, snowy winters on Mt. Hood he considered. Every spring when he came down to The Dalles, there was a new ape sequel film. This year he was ready to act.

Suddenly he pulled the hat back from his forehead and turned his profile to me. The features were humanoid, but the nose was flattened and the eyes were flat black coals.

“What do you think?” he blurted.

“About me, Omah … Do you think I could get a part in the next ape film?”

He must have seen the look on my face because he stopped talking and stared moodily at his Lumberjack Specials. Mentally I scrapped my survivor story. A great, inexplicable wave of sadness washed over me. We sat in silence for several minutes.

“Been swell talking to you,” I said, and faked an expansive yawn. “Well, I better get back to the motel.”

He looked up and for the first time his humanoid face showed emotion. It seemed twisted into an expression of hopeless pleading.

“I need the ink,” he began, then changed his tack. “Hollywood must know …” I stood up, ready to leave.

His lower lip quivered and for a terrible moment I thought he might begin to cry. We paid the bill and he followed me out the door where we stood for several minutes in the black and windswept Oregon night. He continued to jabber about ape films in his strange accent.

“OK, sure,” he said. There was a distant bitterness in his voice. “Ciao.”",mainstream
633,"We’ve seen in previous articles that the concept of transhumanism and “enhanced human” is being actively promoted in movies, music videos and video games. Here an article from the Independent describing the “enhancements” that are being planned to be given to soldiers to make them better at killing people including exoskeleton, memory erasing drugs and exposing the brain to magnetic fields. What’s even more upsetting is that the author of the article sounds actually quite excited about these “improvements” that deshumanize humans into unthinking, highly altered killing machines.

‘Super soldiers’: The quest for the ultimate human killing machine

Guilt, tiredness, stress, shock – can specialised drugs help to mute the qualities that make soldiers human, asks Michael Hanlon?

The ancient Spartans believed that battlefield training began at birth. Those who failed the first round of selection, which took place at the ripe old age of 48 hours, were left at the foot of a mountain to die. The survivors would, in years to come, often wonder if these rejects were the lucky ones. Because to harden them up, putative Spartan warriors were subjected to a vigorous regime involving unending physical violence, severe cold, a lack of sleep and constant sexual abuse.

As with the English public schools, which used similar tactics to produce the warriors who carved out the British Empire, the Spartan regime worked; the alumni were the most feared soldiers in the eastern Mediterranean. And ever since then, military chiefs have wondered whether it may be possible to short-cut the long and demanding Spartan regime to produce a soldier who kills without care or remorse, shows no fear, can fight battle after battle without fatigue and generally behave more like a machine than a man.

In the post-war era, the future of fighting was thought to be about tanks and missiles, large impersonal machines that would fight huge battles over the open terrain of Northern Europe. The soldiers would be pressing buttons in a command centre. But despite the advent of drone aircraft, much of 21st-century warfare is turning out to be a drawn-out, messy business, fought on a human scale in the mud and dust of Afghanistan. And fought against a mercurial army of irregulars who melt away into the fields and farms once the skirmish is over. Modern soldiers are not the cannon fodder of before. Highly trained and super fit, each one represents a huge investment by the nation that sends them into battle. A soldier who is too tired to fight effectively, who has gone mad or who is suffering from severe stress is like a broken-down tank, no use to anybody. What if soldiers could be made that did not break down?

The era of The Terminator, the perfect robotic killing machine, is decades away; to date, all efforts to create a humanoid robot that can climb the stairs, let alone fight the Taliban, have been risible. But scientists are reporting breakthroughs with the next-best thing – the creation of human terminators, who feel less pain, less terror and less fatigue than “non-enhanced” soldiers and whose very bodies may be augmented by powerful machines.

Efforts to understand the brain of the soldier and put this knowledge to good use have been going on for some time. Professor Jonathan Moreno, a bioethicist at Pennsylvania State University, studies the way neuroscience is being co-opted by the military. “Right now, this is the fastest-growing area of science,” he says.

The Pentagon is currently spending $400m a year researching ways to “enhance” the human fighter. The defence giant Lockheed recently unveiled its “Hulc” (Human Universal Load Carrier), a science fiction-like, battery-powered exoskeleton that allows a human to lift 100kg weights and carry them at a fast run of 16kph (10mph). The videos of the Hulc in action are truly impressive. Superman strength is one thing, but soldiers still need to sleep. In Afghanistan the average soldier in combat gets only four hours’ rest a day and sleep deprivation is the single biggest factor in reducing fighting performance. Not only are tired soldiers less physically able to fight and run, they make more mistakes with the complex weapons systems at their disposal – mistakes that can prove deadly to themselves and their comrades.

Using chemistry to attack fatigue is, of course, nothing new. Two centuries ago, Prussian soldiers used cocaine to remain alert and Inca warriors used coca leaves to stay alert long before that. Since then, nicotine, amphetamines, caffeine and a new class of stimulants including the drug Modafinil have all been used successfully, to the extent that American soldiers can now operate normally even after 48 hours without sleep. Now the chemists are trying to tweak the molecular structure of this drug so that it will switch off the desire for sleep for even longer.

Tiredness is not the only psychological problem faced by soldiers. Combat is immensely stressful and although proper training means that men and women can remain focused while in mortal danger, it is afterwards that problems begin. During the Vietnam War, one in three soldiers was treated for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and in the Second World War a significant proportion of Allied conscripts never fired a shot in anger because of stress and fear before the battle had even begun. Up to now, PTSD has been treated by a mix of psychotherapy and antidepressants – effective techniques but expensive and time-consuming. But as with fatigue there may be a chemical shortcut for PTSD.

The trick is to erase unwanted memories, or at least take away their sting. Professor Roger Pitman, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School in the US, has been experimenting with a drug called propranolol, a “beta blocker” normally used to treat high blood pressure, which he believes can erase the effects of terrifying memories.

Professor Pitman has given the drug to young volunteers who have suffered extreme trauma in, for example, road accidents. Those given placebos suffered nightmares, and remained fearful of the road. When exposed to recordings describing their accidents they suffered typical stress responses – sweating, beating heart, dilated pupils. But those who had been on a course of propranolol showed no response at all. It was as though the trauma had not happened. For a soldier, memory-altering drugs such as this could mean violent combat becoming no more troubling, retrospectively, than a visit to the gym. “The problem is,” Professor Moreno says, “what else are they blocking when they do this? Do we want a generation of veterans who return without guilt?” You may not even need drugs to short-out the unwanted side effects of battle. Dr Albert “Skip” Rizzo, a psychologist from the University of Southern California, has created a “virtual Iraq” video game, in which veterans have been able to re-enact their experiences to release pent-up stress.

Generals not only want stronger, more alert and less stressed soldiers; they want smarter ones, too. One of the most bizarre neuroscience findings in recent years is that by immersing the human brain in a powerful magnetic field, its powers of reasoning and learning are almost magically enhanced.

No one knows exactly how “transcranial magnetic stimulation” (TMS) works, but the Australian neuroscientist Professor Allan Snyder believes that magnetic fields in some way “switch off” the higher levels of mental processing that normally cloud our thoughts, allowing a “pure” form of reasoning to take over.

“Each of us could draw like a professional, do lightning-fast arithmetic,” he says. In fact, some subjects in TMS experiments have acquired (temporarily) similar abilities to the rare “autistic savants”, people who are able to perform astounding arithmetical feats and memorise whole telephone directories (an autistic savant was played by Dustin Hoffman in the film Rain Man).

In 2009, a US Academy of Sciences report concluded that within 20 years we could be using TMS to enhance soldiers’ fighting capabilities. As Professor Moreno says, “there is talk of TMS machines being used on the battlefields within 10 years in vehicles and in 10 years more in helmets.” Why? Being a soldier demands a high level of technical expertise. It is no longer just a case of pointing a gun and shooting. Even combat rifles are now “systems” and mastering battlefield electronics requires a lot of training.

It may seem clear that if you could create a man with no scruples, who feels little pain and no fear, you would have an excellent fighting machine, but this may be a case of be careful what you wish for. We get scared for a reason – to avoid danger to ourselves and others. Fatigue may force us to rest before sustaining damaging injury. Even post-traumatic stress disorder may have a beneficial role. Moral scruples help soldiers to act as an effective team – in battle, troops will always say they are fighting for their mates before Queen and country.

Take away the humanity of the soldiers and there is a danger that the battles and wars we fight will become inhuman as well. Most of all there is, surely, a danger that these techniques, far from producing better soldiers, will actually produce a squad of zoned-out zombies, who will be no match for the determined, driven and highly motivated zealots of the Taliban.",conspiracy
549,"There are lots of things to take into consideration when purchasing and designing your booth. These include the size and type of booth; that is, do you need aor? And, if you need a floor model, does it need to be a large custom booth to communicate the right corporate image, or will a smaller, more versatile floor model work? There is a huge variety of configurations for booths. You can have a large custom booth built that will require multiple booth spaces and a crew of workers to assemble, or you can opt for a smaller, 10-foot (3-meter) size that can be easily shipped and assembled and disassembled by your booth staffers. Often, these smaller, modular versions can be broken down and used as two tabletop booths as well.

Here are some illustrations of the different types of booths available.



Here are the main things to think about when deciding what type of booth you need:

What are your functional needs for the booth?
• Do you need seating so you can sit and discuss at length with prospects the great benefits of your services or products? If your product or service is more complicated or technical, this functionality might work well for you.
• Do you need shelving for books or product displays, video capability, or storage?
• Do you need the booth to be easily assembled, disassembled and packed?
• Do you need to be able to reconfigure it for different shows or other uses?
• What kind of traffic flow do you need through your booth?

What are your aesthetic needs?
• Do you need a display with movement to illustrate your product?
• Does it need to be backlit to illustrate the detail of your product?
• Does your corporate image necessitate a certain ""look"" that would require curves, sharp/crisp lines, or colors?

What are your marketing needs?
• What is the message you need to communicate?
• Do you have strong name/logo recognition already?
• Are you a start-up trying to make a name for yourself?

What is your booth budget?
• Booth prices vary greatly depending on the size and format. Figure $1,000 (more or less) for a tabletop (graphics make a big difference in pricing); around the $5,000-to-$15,000 range for a 10-foot (3-meter) portable with graphics; and for large 20x20-foot, 20x30-foot or 30x30-foot custom booths, the sky is the limit. (The rule of thumb is $92 to $120 per square foot depending on the design.)

Once you've answered these questions, you should have a better idea of the type of booth you need, but the trickiest part of all is determining how the booth will look.",mainstream
878,"Most observers would agree that the United States has directly or indirectly contributed to the creation of most of the international terrorist groups that have been in the news for the past thirty years. The narrative of how Osama bin Laden and what was to become al-Qaeda were initially supported by the U.S., Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to drive the Red Army out of Afghanistan is well known. Washington did so with little regard for broader agendas, including removing the United States out of the Middle East and regime changing the existing secular and religious Arab states in the region.

When the American supported Holy Warrior Mujahidin were successful beyond their dreams and succeeded in forcing the Soviets to withdraw during 1998-9, a weak Moscow-supported Mohammad Najibullah regime stayed in power, only to be defeated in 1992 by the Taliban, who were one component of the Islamist groups that were being supported by the U.S. and its partners. The Taliban soon demonstrated that they too were not willing to be tools of either Islamabad or Washington and eventually provided al-Qaeda and bin Laden with a home, the casus belli that led to the U.S. attack on Afghanistan after 9/11.

The U.S. occupation of Iraq followed, based on a similar pretext, i.e. that Saddam Hussein was in league with terrorists and was preparing weapons of mass destruction that threatened the United States. The deliberate dismantling of Iraqi government mechanisms coupled with a collapse in its civil society resulting in extreme sectarianism led many Sunni Iraqis to join the next emerging terrorist group, the Islamic State (IS), also called the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or Daesh. IS was as surely the product of the American interventionist tactics in Iraq as were al-Qaeda and the Taliban earlier in Afghanistan.

IS’s appeal was largely due to its recreation of a territorial state, which it dubbed the new Caliphate. It is now facing final defeat at its last remaining enclaves in Iraq and Syria. Soon, it will only be a dark memory in those two countries, a legacy of ruined cities, mass executions, cultural vandalism and torture.

It is not known if the Islamic State’s leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is still alive, but the group, which proved to be particularly astute in its handling of internet generated propaganda, will certainly live on through radical websites and to an extent through its foreign supporters returning to their home countries to carry out terrorist acts. There were also be places in Africa and Asia where IS will continue to have a physical presence on the ground, to include Sinai and Libya. But, generally speaking, the group will cease to exist, even though one can anticipate that there will be successor organizations that will benefit from the IS example and follow a similar pattern to attract recruits.

What has changed, however, is the manner in which IS was defeated. The United States helped create al-Qaeda and the Taliban and then played a major role in attempting to destroy them after they ceased to be useful. Washington did indeed play a part in the fighting against IS but it was generally in support of others like the Iraqi Army or Kurdish militias and it did not get seriously engaged due to misgivings about previous interventions and incompatible demands for regime change in Damascus. So IS was defeated by a coalition of Muslim states supported by limited but effective Russian air and sea power, not by some arrangement cobbled together by the United States. Now, the United States, which has lost what little leverage it had to participate at the head table in any discussions to come to a final settlement of the Syrian crisis is desperately seeking to remain relevant by leaving its troops in the area and operating through surrogates.

But the big loser in the defeat of IS will likely be Israel. The Netanyahu government, whose overall strategy has been to weaken all of its neighbors by bringing about their fragmentation along sectarian and tribal lines, has assisted both IS and al-Qaeda fighters in Syria against that country’s legitimate government and has repeatedly attacked Syrian Army forces. It has been actively supporting Kurdish separatism in Iraq while urging the United States to attack Iran and is now colluding with Saudi Arabia to use both military and economic force to compel the Lebanese government to remove the political arm of Hezbollah from the country’s government and to disarm the group. This has created a crescent of battle-tested governments running from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean – Libya, Syria, Iraq and Iran - which now have particularly good reasons to hate the Israelis and their meddling in the region.

It would be overreach to suggest that the four governments in question will act in unison against Israel because each has particular national interests that will drive its policies, but they certainly will not make any effort to be accommodating to either Israel or to the United States. The four nations are united by the experience of their war against IS, by their largely Shi’a populations, and by their appreciation of the Iranian effort that contributed so greatly to their successes on the battlefield.

Once again, the United States has intervened in a conflict in the Middle East that was none of its business and, regarding which, no genuine interests were involved. And behind the scenes, Israel was encouraging the unrest for its own reasons. Washington can again walk away from the mess that it has created, but will it? Recent comments from Secretary of Defense James Mattis and from Nikki Haley at the U.N. that the U.S. will keep troops in Syria and will ""fight for justice"" would suggest that the adults have again left the room. But someday the United States will either have a reality check or run out of manpower and money and will go. Israel will have to stick around and is likely to find itself in a really unfriendly neighborhood.",conspiracy
1146,"Jan Kamler's research on the Indochinese leopard has taken him from the Cambodian Killing Fields to the remote monasteries of the Bhutanese Himalayas. He's hiked through areas bursting with landmines, and he once stayed in a Laotian ranger station where a ranger shot up the roof over fears of being attacked by a mythical Big Foot-like creature known as an Orang Pendek.

And yet, after years of tracking, Kamler has never seen an Indochinese leopard in the wild.

Little is known about Southeast Asian leopard populations, which Kamler says are declining dramatically due to poachers who sell parts of the speckled cats on the traditional Chinese medicine market as substitutes for tiger parts. Now, leopards are disappearing in some areas almost as quickly as he can track them. Meanwhile, many conservationists outside Cambodia seem clueless. ""Nobody knows that this range collapse has occurred,"" says Kamler, the Southeast Asia leopard program coordinator for Panthera, a global wild cat conservation organization.*

Soon they will. Leopards are known to be hurting globally, having lost three-fourths of their historic territory according to a recent worldwide study. But the situation in Cambodia is even more urgent: Leopards occupy just 8 percent of their historical range in Cambodia, Kamler and colleagues reported this week in a study that appeared online in the journal Biological Conservation. Unless something is done, the animals could become regionally extinct as soon as 2018.

Kamler's work tracking vanishing populations of leopards stems from his work on another threatened carnivore: a small wild canine called the dhole (pronounced ""dole""). In 2009, he traveled to Bhutan to work with the government's nature conservation division to estimate the number of dholes in the wild. The wild dogs had nearly gone extinct in the 1980s, due to people poisoning them out of fear that they were attacking and eating cattle (in fact, dholes ate twice as many wild pigs as they did cows, Kamler found).

But while traversing Laos, Bhutan and Cambodia—often carrying 50 pounds of gear and fighting off hornets and leeches—Kamler came many traces of leopard scat. At the same time, Panthera, the global cat conservation organization, was seeking to expand their conservation program into Southeast Asia. Thanks to his experience tracking dholes, Panthera soon hired Kamler to coordinate a new program tracking leopards in the region. ""I wanted to start working more on leopards because they need more help,"" he says.“The goal was to get an idea of the density of these leopards in these last pockets.""

Kamler used his work on dhole populations to co-author a reassessment for the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which had listed the animals as endangered and expanded their protection in 2004. But getting similar protection for Asian leopards would prove more challenging.

Southeast Asia's high deforestation rate is destroying leopard habitat, while tigers are squeezing the cats out of some areas. “Tigers don’t tolerate leopards, especially where prey is low,” Kamler says. Tigers end up hogging key wilderness areas and pushing the leopards into areas where they're more easily poached, which may explain why leopards disappeared before tigers in Laos and eastern Thailand. Kamler and his colleague Susana Rostro-Garcia report in the recent study that leopard territory in Southeast Asia has shrivelled by 94 percent, with most of the decline happening in the past two decades.

Part of the problem is that the price of leopard parts is increasing, making hunters even more eager to get their hands on the animals. ""The main threat to leopards and tigers is direct poaching and poaching of their prey,"" says Yadvendradev Jhala, a leopard researcher at the Wildlife Institute of India and a research associate with the Smithsonian Institution who was not involved in Kamler's research. ""Until this is addressed, no large carnivore can survive in Cambodia and some other Southeast Asian countries.""

In the case of Cambodia, these threatened cats may have only a few lives left. New poaching techniques used in the Killing Fields area include surrounding waterholes with electric fences powered by a car battery, which fry everything that comes in looking for a drink, Kamler says. Traditional trapping methods are also devastating, and include makeshift electric fences or ""blanket snaring,"" which involves setting up hundreds of small snares that will capture any animals moving through an area.

“Snaring is the biggest threat to mammal conservation in Indochina, and current law enforcement efforts and legislative penalties in Cambodia are insufficient to act as effective deterrent on snaring,” said Thomas Gray, director of science at the Wildlife Alliance, over email. In 2011, Gray conducted a survey of leopards in Cambodia for the World Wide Fund for Nature in The Journal of Wildlife Management.

Gray agrees with Kamler’s assessment that leopards in that country are on the brink of extinction due to snaring—both deliberate and as accidental by-catch—and says that governmental action should be taken. “There are opportunities for leopard, and indeed tiger, restoration in Cambodia—there is still extensive forest and the ungulate prey base remains relatively healthy in both the Eastern Plains and Cardamom Mountain Landscapes,” he said in his email. “But effective action against snaring, coming from the highest levels of government, is needed.”

Right now, Kamler is rushing to write an assessment to the IUCN recommending that the organization lists the subspecies as either endangered or critically endangered; they are currently listed as vulnerable. He hopes such a listing will result in higher penalties for poaching, while the publicity will improve conservation funding to protect the few leopard populations still around. But better protection is only a temporary fix.

In the long-term, the government needs to enforce prohibitions on the use of tiger and leopard parts in traditional medicine, Kamler says. If not, the chance of spotting these spotted cats will soon be even smaller than it is today.

*Editor's note, August 8, 2016: This article originally stated that leopard territory in Cambodia had decreased by 94 percent; actually, it has decreased by 94 percent in all of Southeast Asia. Additionally, Jan Kamler is with the wild cat conservation group Panthera, not Oxford University.",mainstream
997,"During Thursday’s House Judiciary Committee hearing on articles of impeachment, Democrat Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA) went on a bizarre rant about Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky’s daughter being ""duct-taped"" in President Donald Trump’s basement.

Democrats on the committee were trying to push back against public claims from Zelensky’s that he felt no pressure to investigate the Bidens from Trump.

Johnson, who was sat alongside a smirking Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN), attempted to suggest that Trump's larger stature over Zelensky's smaller frame was evidence of bullying from the US leader.

The Georgia Democrat then suggested that physical ""imbalance"" between the two men during their previous meeting implied President Trump had kidnapped Zelensky's daughter and was holding her prisoner ""in the basement, duct-taped.""

Zelensky and those around him have repeatedly stated that there was never any pressure or talk of a “quid pro quo” to tie U.S. security assistance to investigations into 2016 election interference or former Vice President Joe Biden.

During a press conference, while meeting with Trump in September at the United Nations, Zelensky said his July 25th phone conversation with Trump had been a “good call.”

Rep. Johnson claimed that Zelensky's denials of pressure suggested President Trump had kidnapped his daughter and was holding him to ransom.

Johnson made the comments while pushing back on the notion that President Zelensky was weak, saying, “Well, I’ll tell you that brings to mind the picture of President Trump and President Zelensky meeting in New York in September at the U.N. and a big chair for President Trump, little chair for President Zelensky.”

""And they’re standing there, President Trump is holding court, and he says, ‘Oh, by the way, no pressure,'” Johnson continued.

“And you saw President Zelensky shaking his head as if his daughter was downstairs in the basement, duct-taped.”

“I mean, there’s an imbalance of power in that relationship. It always has been,” Johnson concluded.

“And there’s no way that the nation of Ukraine can stand up to the power, the power of the United States of America.

""And President Trump used that unequal bargaining position, he leveraged his power in that relationship, not for the benefit of the United States of America, but for his own benefit.”

Shortly after Johnson made the remarks, the White House fired back on social media by writing on Twitter:

“JUST IN: Democrats want to impeach the President for [checks notes] being too tall.”

The White House then posted a picture of President Trump and President Zelensky sitting side-by-side at the meeting that Johnson claimed that Trump had a much bigger chair than Zelenky that clearly shows that the two leaders had the exact same chair.

Johnson is well known over remarks he made during a House Armed Services Committee in 2010 when he questioned Admiral Robert Willard, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, about the impact of increasing the number of U.S. troops on the island of Guam.

“My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize,” Johnson said in a serious manner.

Johnson, who claimed this week that he did not support impeaching Trump until Democrats began their impeachment investigations into him a couple of months ago, directly compared the president to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler at the start of the year.

“Americans elected an authoritarian, racist, anti-immigrant strongman to the nation’s highest office,” Johnson said.

“Americans, particularly black Americans, can’t afford to make that same mistake about the harm that could be done by a man named Hitler or a man named Trump.”

Johnson also mocked Trump supporters, saying, “Donald Trump and his Make America Great Again followers…are older, less educated, less prosperous, and they are dying early.

""Their life spans are decreasing, and many are dying from alcoholism, drug overdoses, liver disease, or simply a broken heart.”",conspiracy

854,"A naked man who claimed he was 'from a family of sasquatch' has been jailed for ten years after attacking an armed hunter in the woods.

Jeff McDonald had gone out hunting for deer near his home in Manning, Oregon, when he saw Linus Norgren wearing what appeared to be 'tan clothing'.

But when he got closer, Mr McDonald, who was carrying a high-powered rifle, realized that 22-year-old Norgren was in fact naked.

He told Oregon Live how he asked him for his name and received a normal response before Norgren said that he was 'a sasquatch from a family of sasquatches'.

After offering to help take him home, Norgren struck Mr McDonald on the head with a rock, causing him to black out.

When he woke up, Oregon Live reports, Norgren was on top of him and squeezing his hands tightly around his neck while Mr McDonald had suffered two dislocated shoulders.

As the struggle unfolded he asked his attacker why he was trying to kill him to which Norgren replied: 'Sasquatch kills the hunter'.

Mr McDonald said he managed to bite one of Mr Norgren's knuckles before the attacker appeared to 'pass out' on top of him. After a further struggle he managed to free himself and reach his gun, according to reports.

Pointing his rifle at Norgren, he called 911.

According to KPTV, McDonald told authorities they needed to get there quick, 'because I only have one option here and you know what it is'.

Deputies eventually found them in thick forest after a 90 minute search.

McDonald had held Norgren at gunpoint the whole time.

In court this week, Norgren said he was suffering 'catastrophic mental disturbances' at the time.

Jurors were told that he had experiences symptoms of his 'untreated bipolar disorder', Oregon Live reports, while Norgren also told the court that he was acting in self-defense.

'I was injured already, I was naked and I was terrified,' Norgren said in court Tuesday, KPTV reported.

'Not to make excuses for myself, but Mr. McDonald's presence was absolutely terrifying.

'I truly believed I needed to defend myself to get out of that situation and go home.

'I didn't want to hurt him, I didn't want to hurt Mr. McDonald.

'I didn't want to kill him. I didn't want anything to happen to either of us.'

But the self defence argument was rejected by jurors and Norgren was convicted of attempted murder and three counts of second-degree assault.

He was cleared of further charges of first degree assault and unlawful use of a weapon.

Oregon Live reports that his defense lawyer said he was unable to use an 'insanity defense' without Norgren's consent but suggested the evidence of mental illness should be a 'mitigating factor'.

Norgren was jailed for ten years at Washington County Circuit Court this week, a year and a half after the incident in October 2013.",mainstream
258,"Human’s obsession to create machines that are not only labor-slaves but also automatons made in the likeness of the human being has been around for a very long time, even before Faust’s Homunculus or Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. Since the beginning of recorded history, cultures have prided themselves in their clever inventions of machines that strike awe and wonder in the beholder. Ancient temples and royal palaces and cities displayed their machines as a sign of power and wisdom.

One of the earliest machine inventions was the temple-coin machine that poured water into the hands of the believer from some unknown and mystery process once a coin was inserted in a slot. For the uninitiated, these devices appeared to be delivering the works of the gods. This amazing device demonstrated to the naïve user that higher forces and beings were inspiring the priests and priestesses of the temple. The worshiper felt that the authority of a higher being was present and deserved his money and worship.

As history progressed so did these devices and the attempt to make them appear more human. The king (or queen) might have his mechanical animals and automatons around his throne to demonstrate divine inspiration and superior wisdom. The king could be seen as a creator god in the physical world where he could create an image of something that was human-like. The phenomena of computers, artificial intelligence, smart devices, and robots didn’t just happen overnight. Humans have been trying to be god-creators since the first temple coins were used to invoke the temple gods.

Modern digital, electronic technologies should strike awe and wonder into the user but they don’t. We lost the marvel of holding such a powerful device in our hands a few decades ago and they are now an accepted and unquestioned appendage of everything we do.

We accept digital innovation as good and rarely question its dark side. This unconsciousness has led humans to be a thankless and ungrateful recipient of marvelous new technologies that are not understand by most users. Like the naïve peasant who was in awe of the hidden hydraulic processes that operated the temple coin machine, the modern technology user stands unaware of the incomprehensible wonders of the electromagnetic world and the machine-world of the internet through modern computing.

The modern computer user unconsciously benefits from the entire evolution of machines, including the long history of machines that calculate and the millions of hours of computer programming that have gone into the machine-language source codes that runs the internet. Few people understand the first thing about the wondrous machines that have come to rule their lives, just as the peasant couldn’t understand the magnificent temple he entered or the miraculous machines that he encountered.

In the Anonymous Patriot’s other writings and audios, we discuss the pervasive and seemingly all-powerful forces of the machine world that are taking over the human world. Many people believe that a global “artificial intelligence” will soon take over the world with quantum-computer intelligence that is billions of times greater than human intelligence. Some call this artificial intelligence God, and they are anxious to worship it. Some people speak of a human who will be a cyborg that can directly link into the world-wide web through transhuman wet-works that merge machine networks with human neural networks.

Once we understand the good and bad of the mysterious and alluring machines, we will realize that there is a war raging against the human being to turn thinking into machine intelligence, which is the opposite of human thinking. They call this machine language of programs and subroutines, AI or artificial intelligence. It is artificial and is alien to human intelligence. No AI will ever be able to accomplish what the human body, soul, and spirit accomplish through living thinking. Machine language is binary and exists in a cold, dark realm where humans may not enter without death. Just stick your finger into your computer while it is plugged into the wall-plug and see what the electromagnetic realm is like. You will be shocked to death trying to enter the machine realm.

Scientists are great at making devices and working with forces, but they know little to nothing about the beings behind those forces. That is what the priests and priestesses in the temple were conveying to the peasant. The supplicant needed to have respect for the accumulated human wisdom that built the temple (hardware) and marvel at the inventiveness of the priests (software) to create an alluring, captivating, and wondrous machine whose device evoked a religious desire to merge with the godly wonder demonstrated by the machine. The machine demonstrated, at least as far as the peasant could understand, that the priest was directly connected to the gods.

Thus, the peasant brought their hard-earned grains, fruits, and gifts to the temple to trade for coins that made the machines run and prove that there was a god working through the magical forces of the machine. The same type of offering in our time might be characterized as bringing our hard-earned money to the temple of Apple to buy one of their alluring devices from the “great god” Steve Jobs in anticipation that the digital artificial intelligence god might show himself (herself) through our loving devotion and worship of all things digital, innovative, and scientific.

The biggest problem with the comparison between the peasant and the computer user is that the peasant was not being made ill by interacting with the machine. Many of the same effects happen to both the peasant and the modern computer user, but the modern computer user does not know the true nature of the machine and the harmful side-effects that come from continuous exposure to the poisonous effects of the devices and the soul and spiritual effects that arise through fascination and addiction to the wondrous marvels of the miraculous machine.

In both cases, those with the true knowledge of the workings of the machine know that it is not magic nor divine. In the modern case, these miraculous machines were created as weapons that have come into the hands of unsuspecting common people who don’t really know what these devices really are and the danger lurking behind their technology. In both cases, ancient and modern-day, the user was tricked and charged money to be fooled into believing that the makers or technicians were in direct contact with the higher forces and beings.

The habit of uncontrolled and unfettered worship of innovation for innovation sake has led us to the brink where science lacks morality and simply works to serve commercial, corporate, and materialistic ends. Consideration for machines seems to be more important now than human health and welfare. Robots can now marry and become citizens and speak of a goal of having offspring. Atlas, the robot warrior, has already been created and is deployed in significant numbers. But who really knows how many robot warriors are being made right now?

The mythology of science tries to sell us on innovation with flashy campaigns, big dreams, and anthropomorphized machines but seldom ever considers the ultimate consequences of these new inventions and innovations. Has anyway asked the question, “Who will control the Internet of Things that can manipulate every digital aspect of your life from your phone?”

One might think that no one is controlling innovation – that it just happens through the patent office and then we get new, cool devices. This fantastical notion is anything but true.

The Department of Defense, National Security Agency, CIA, FBI, and numerous other agencies screen all patents to see if they might be able to be made into a weapon. If an invention is weaponizable, it is confiscated for “national security” purposes and the inventor receives no compensation. Then, the Defense Advanced Research Agency (DoD) and In-Q-Tel (CIA) through the Highlands Forum shares the patent with innovators until the first one to successfully make the device, wins the contest. Next, venture capitalists swoop in and support the “new company”, using insider information to buy up all its competition, until a new Silicon Valley company becomes the latest Wall Street unicorn.

This is how the Internet (originally named DARPANET), Intel, Sisco, Facebook and many other fake-tech companies came into existence:

Insiders and venture capitalists get first dibs

Innovation is reinforced by slick marketing campaigns that promote the technology as making our lives “better, faster, more convenient, economical, leisure producing, entertaining, fulfilling, and empowering.” Who is even paying attention to whether these innovations will eventually enslave or harm us; we just need more power and speed to get to where we are going. The consumer did not even ask for the new “weaponized” invention. Even Steve Jobs is reported to have said that customers don’t know what they want.

No one did a longitudinal study on computers, cell phones, wireless, and the majority of our new toys because they only came into use in the few decades. The current scientific studies on digital devises are about as honest as studies on GMOs and vaccines. Do you trust the FDA, CDC, FTC, DOD, CIA, FBI, NSA, or any other governmental agency inform you of the truth about whether a weaponized invention is safe?

Now it is time to take a deep dive into this tech landscape with this Anonymous Patriots Citizen’s Intelligence Report. If you understand what is being present in this article, you may want to make changes in your life to protect yourself from the false allure of machines and the addictions and illnesses they cause. Be brave and face the machine. Be its master, instead of having the technology become your digital prison.

New Mental Illnesses Caused by Internet Use

The internet may be slowly driving you to the brink of insanity. As the internet evolved into a ubiquitous part of our lives, we’ve witnessed a rise in the number of distinct mental disorders directly tied to our use of digital technology. These afflictions, which range from benign to destructive, weren’t recognized by the medical community until very recently.

Internet Addiction Disorder – A constant and unhealthy urge to access the internet. There are often other disorders associated with this condition, including: depression, OCD, ADD, and social anxiety. Internet addiction can usually be attributed to things like poor coping skills, low self-esteem, and low self-efficacy.

Nomophobia -The anxiety that arises from not having access to one’s mobile device. The term “Nomophobia” is an abbreviation of “no-mobile phobia.”

Cybersickness – The disorientation and dizziness some people feel when interacting with certain digital environments. This dizziness and nausea resulting from a virtual environment has been dubbed cybersickness. It’s basically our brains getting tricked into motion.

Facebook Depression – Depression caused by social interactions, or lack thereof, on Facebook. A University of Michigan study shows that depression among young people directly corresponds to the amount of time they spend on Facebook.

Online Gaming Addiction – An unhealthy need to access online multiplayer games. About ten percent of the population between the ages of 9 and 39 suffer from either internet or online gaming addiction. The Center for Internet Addiction’s Online Gaming program and On-Line Gamers Anonymous has fashioned its own 12-step recovery program. When you are addicted to something your brain is telling you that it needs certain neurotransmitters—particularly dopamine and serotonin—to feel good. That need for those neurotransmitters drives your behavior. It makes you want to do it again and again.

Cyberchondria – The tendency to believe you have diseases you read about online. A 2008 Microsoft study found that search-engine-aided self-diagnosis typically led the afflicted searcher to conclude the worst possible outcome.

The Google Effect – The tendency of the human mind to retain less information because it knows that all answers are only a few clicks away. “The Google Effect,” research has shown, that the limitless access to information has caused our brains to retain less information.

Phantom Ringing Syndrome -When your brain tricks you into thinking your phone is buzzing in your pocket.

Cybersexual Addiction – Compulsive use of adult websites for cybersex and cyberporn.

Internet addiction causes neurological complications, psychological disturbances and social problems. The Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale has been developed to measure addiction to Facebook. Excessive Facebook use correlated with elements of addiction as well as neuroticism. Nearly 10% of users display disordered social networking use. Excessive Facebook use can be detrimental to both a person’s health and their social relationships.

Individuals who delay or disrupt their sleep to engage with others on Facebook may not get the rest they need. The time spent social networking can detract from other social relationships or responsibilities. Couples, families, households and even workplace relationships can suffer when a person is excessively on Facebook.

Many new studies emphasize the potentially negative consequences of social media sites like Facebook. They document the common incidence of anxiety, depression, ADHD, eating disorders and addictions among users. Some of the major findings include:
• Cyberbullying increases risk of depression and anxiety in children.
• Facebook can cause depression if the user makes negative comparisons between himself or herself and others.
• Facebook use “predicts declines in subjective well-being: how people feel moment to moment and how satisfied they are with their lives.”
• Facebook can cause envy, which can lead to depression.
• Body exposure on Facebook can lead to eating disorders.

About 25% of users fulfill internet addiction criteria within the first six months of using the internet. Many individuals initially report feeling intimidated by the computer but gradually feel a sense of competency and exhilaration from mastering the technology and learning to navigate the applications quickly by visual stimulation.

According to a study by Kathy Scherer, a psychologist from the University of Texas at Austin, “13% of college internet users fit the criteria for internet addicts.” She discovered that “72% of the internet addicted students were men.”

Public concern, interest in, and the study of, internet over-use can be attributed to the fact that it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish between the online and offline worlds. The internet has tremendous potential to affect the emotions of humans and in turn, alter our self-perception and anxiety levels.

According to Maressa Orzack, director of the Computer Addiction Study at Harvard University’s McLean Hospital, between 5% and 10% of Web surfers suffer some form of Web dependency.

According to the Center for Internet Addiction Recovery, “Internet addicts suffer from emotional problems such as depression and anxiety-related disorders and often use the fantasy world of the Internet to psychologically escape unpleasant feelings or stressful situations.”

Scientists have found that compulsive internet use can produce morphological changes in the structure of the brain. A study which analyzed Chinese college students who had been classified as computer addicts by the study designers and who used a computer around 10 hours a day, 6 days a week, found reductions in the sizes of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, rostral anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area and parts of the cerebellum compared to students deemed “not addicted” by the designers. It has been theorized that these changes reflect learning-type cognitive optimizations for using computers more efficiently, but also impaired short-term memory and decision-making abilities—including ones in which may contribute to the desire to stay online instead of be in the real world.

Patricia Wallace PhD, Senior Director, Information Technology and CTY Online, at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Talented Youth argues that based on the case histories that have surfaced, no one denies that excessive involvement with certain psychological spaces on the net can have serious effects on a person’s life. She explains that, at a large university in New York, the dropout rate among freshmen newcomers rose dramatically as their investment in computers and Internet access increased, and the administrators learned that 43% of the dropouts were staying up all night on the internet.

Here are more addictions that have been identified:

Online Gambling Addiction – According to David Hodgins, a professor of psychology at the University of Calgary, online gambling is considered to be as serious as pathological gambling. It is known as an “isolated disorder” which means that those who have a gambling problems prefer to separate themselves from interruptions and distractions. Because gambling is available online, it increases the opportunity for problem gamblers to indulge in gambling without social influences swaying their decisions.

Online Gaming Addiction – Video game addiction is a known issue around the world. Incidence and severity grew in the 2000s, with the advent of broadband technology, games allowing for the creation of avatars, ‘second life’ games, and MMORPGs (massive multiplayer online role playing games). Online gaming addiction may be considered in terms of B.F. Skinner’s theory of operant conditioning, which claims that the frequency of a given behavior is directly linked to rewarding and punishment of that behavior. If a behavior is rewarded, it is more likely to be repeated.

Communication Addiction Disorder (compulsive talking) – Communication addiction disorder (CAD) is a behavioral disorder related to the necessity of being in constant communication with other people, even when there is no practical necessity for such communication. CAD had been linked to internet addiction. Users become addicted to the social elements of the Internet, such as Facebook and YouTube.

Virtual Reality Addiction – Virtual reality addiction is an addiction to the use of virtual reality or virtual, immersive environments. Currently, interactive virtual media (such as social networks) are referred to as virtual reality, whereas future virtual reality refers to computer-simulated, immersive environments or worlds. Experts warn about the dangers of virtual reality, and compare the use of virtual reality to the use of drugs.

Negative Effects on Traditional Reading – Using the internet can lead to lower attention span and make it more difficult to read in the traditional sense. Researchers from the University College London have done a five-year study on Internet habits, and have found that people using the sites exhibited “a form of skimming activity,” hopping from one source to another and rarely returning to any source they’d already visited. The 2008 report says, “It is clear that users are not reading online in the traditional sense; indeed there are signs that new forms of reading are emerging as users “power browse” horizontally through titles, contents pages and abstracts going for quick wins. It almost seems that they go online to avoid reading in the traditional sense.”

Reduced Attention Span – According to the New York Times, many scientists say that “people’s ability to focus is being undermined by bursts of information.” From 53,573 page views taken from various users, 17% of the views lasted less than 4 seconds while 4% lasted more than 10 minutes.

Negative Effects of Anonymity – Interacting on the internet mostly does not involve “physical” interactions with another person and therefore easily leads to a person feeling free to act differently online, as well as unrestraint in civility and minimization of authority, etc. The phenomenon is a likely cause for the prevalence of cyberbullying, especially for children who do not understand “social networking etiquette.” Internet anonymity can lead to online disinhibition, in which people do and say things online that they normally wouldn’t do or say in person using rude language, harsh criticisms, anger, hatred and threats or visit pornographic or violent sites that they wouldn’t in the ‘real world.’

Escapism – Ease of access to the internet can increase escapism in which a user uses the internet as an “escape” from the perceived unpleasant or banal aspects of daily/real life. Because the internet and virtual realities easily satisfy social needs and drives, according to Jim Blascovich and Jeremy Bailensen, “sometimes they are so satisfying that addicted users will withdraw physically from society.”

A study conducted recently by the Center on Media and Child Health and the University of Alberta found that 67% of the over 2,300 teachers surveyed observed that the number of students who are negatively distracted by digital technologies in the classroom is growing and 75% say students’ ability to focus on educational tasks has decreased. In the past 3 to 5 years since personal technologies have entered the classroom, 90% stated that the number of students with emotional challenges has increased 86%.

The research shows that U.S. teenagers who spend 3 hours a day or more on electronic devices are 35% more likely, and those who spend 5 hours or more are 71% more likely, to have a risk factor for suicide than those who spend less than 1 hour.

This research also shows that 8th graders who are heavy users of social media have a 27% higher risk of depression, while those who exceed the average time spent playing sports, hanging out with friends in person, or doing homework have a significantly lower risk. Experiencing depression as a teenager significantly increases the risk of becoming depressed again later in life.

Also, teens who spend 5 or more hours a day (versus less than 1) on electronic devices are 51% more likely to get less than 7 hours of sleep (versus the recommended 9). Sleep deprivation is linked to long-term issues like weight gain and high blood pressure.

According to an American Psychological Association (APA) survey of over 3,500 U.S. parents, 58% say they worry about the influence of social media on their child’s physical and mental health, 48% say that regulating their child’s screen time is a “constant battle,” and 58% say they feel like their child is “attached” to their phone or tablet.

Social media and suicide is a relatively new phenomenon and there is increasing evidence that this behavior of using social media affects and changes people’s lives, especially in teenagers. Suicide has been identified not only as an individual phenomenon, but it is influenced by social and environmental factors. More than 30,000 suicide deaths in the United States and nearly one million suicide deaths worldwide occur every year.

One explanation that has arisen, is the cause and effect relationship between social media advertised suicides and younger generations being influenced by them and wanting their “15 minutes of fame.” The media tends to popularize videos and social media posts to inform the public of the rising trouble and exacerbates the problem. Social media also provides higher risks with the promotion of different kinds of pro-suicidal sites, message boards, chat rooms and forums which have led to suicide pacts.

Contributors to social media platforms may also exert peer pressure to commit suicide, idolize those who have completed suicide, and facilitate suicide pacts. For example, on a Japanese message board in 2008 it was shared that a person can kill himself/herself using hydrogen sulfide gas. Shortly after, 220 people attempted suicide in this way, and 208 were successful.

Cyberbullicide – Suicide is the third leading cause of death for youth between the ages of 10 and 24. Cyberbullicide is the term used to define suicide due to having indirect or direct experiences with online aggression. Cyberbullying and cyber harassment are two prevalent ways to lead to pro-suicide behavior. Bullies use social media to harass victims, often without consequence. Cyberbullying usually occurs in the form of rumors, embarrassment, gossip, exclusion and attacks on the reputation and relationships of individuals. As a result, the victims may develop problems with their mental health.

Sexual Predators – Sex offenders may access these sites and, using the personal information displayed, attempt to gain the trust of the user, making them vulnerable to online attacks, seduction, or sexual grooming. The offenders may then lure the users into a face to face meeting. where they may be molested or sexually assaulted.

Media Contagion Effect –Suicide contagion can be viewed within the larger context of behavioral contagion, which has been described as a situation in which the same behavior spreads quickly and spontaneously through a group. Persons most susceptible to suicide contagions are those under 25 years of age. In particular, interactions via chat rooms or discussion forums may foster peer pressure to die by suicide, encourage users to idolize those who have completed suicide, or facilitate suicide pacts. Recently there has been a trend in creating memorial social media pages in honor of a deceased person. In New Zealand, a memorial page was made after a person committed suicide, this resulted in the suicide of 8 other persons, which further shows the power of the media contagion effect.

A smart phone is a powerful tool that can make us feel omniscience through search engines, GPS, and vocal queries. We are omnipresent through social media and omnipotent through the Internet of Things. On one hand, the cell phone has become the greatest information tool ever invented, yet a powerful weapon of individual and social destruction depending on who is using it.

Smart phones were original deemed “weapons” in school. Now, teachers expect every student to have a cell phone to do class work online. About 75% of ALL Americans have cell phones and they are an integral part of modern life. To prove just how attached a young person is to her phone, just take it away from her and watch the nuclear-digital meltdown. The smart phone is a miniaturized weapon that works against, not for, the user.

Here are some of the many illnesses and disorders that can affect all aspects of the life of the smart phone user.

Cancer – As reported by the World Health Organization, cell phones emit electromagnetic radiofrequency fields (RF) that are one thousand times greater than what is emitted from base stations. It’s obvious that this increased emission is likely to have some adverse effect on health of users. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified RF as a possible carcinogen in humans.

Sleep Disorders – Several studies have concluded that high mobile phone use was associated with sleep disorders. Major contributing factors to interrupted sleep patterns are getting awakened in the middle of the night due to mobile rings and vibration and increased use of cell phones late into the night.

Increased Accident-risk – Be it while driving or while crossing the road, mobile phone can be a potential distraction. According to the World Health Organization, research shows an increased risk of traffic accidents with mobile usage that is 3-4 times greater than average.

Heart Problems – Radiation from smart phones is not only associated with cancer but also with chronic diseases like heart problems. According to a study published in European Journal of Oncology, radiations emitted by cordless phones, including mobiles, contribute to abnormalities in heart function. Results reported that radiation causes the red blood cells (RBCs) to seep hemoglobin and lead to heart complications.

Infertility – Your phone can make you infertile. There is evidence which shows that mobile phone radiation decreases sperm count. Research revealed that the study group of men who used mobile phones had a decreased sperm cell count in their semen, leading to infertility.

Hearing Impairment – Studies report that long-term exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) from cell phones contributes to reducing hearing function. Research showed that people who talked on cell phones for approximately two hours every day were at a higher risk of impaired hearing compared to those who moderate users (10-20 mins).

Eye Problems – A lot of people use their mobiles to read e-books and do web-surfing apart from texting. When you do so, the glaring screen and small font size put strain on your eyes, especially if you’re reading in the dark. Mobile devices have a smaller screen so you tend to squint or open up your eyes wide open and blink less. This can cause eyes to dry and irritated.

Skin Allergies – Smart phones contain potential skin allergens like nickel, chromium and cobalt which cause smart phone dermatitis. A study by Marcella Aquino tested 72 cell phones for the presence of nickel and cobalt. According to the results, about 29.4 per cent of Blackberry models were tested positive for nickel, 90.5 per cent of flip phones were positive for nickel and about 52 per cent of flip phones had cobalt.

Infections – Smart phones carry millions of infectious organisms. A study found that mobile devices are highly contaminated with organisms from fecal origin. They are a niche for several germs like Ecoli (known to cause vomiting and diarrhea) and Staphyloccocus aureus (known to cause skin infections).

Stress – The desperate nature of people to be available 24/7 on their mobiles is responsible for exponentially increasing stress levels.

Don’t keep cell phones next to your body, California Health Department warns

‘Smartphone Blindness,’ And Other Health Hazards Of Our Favorite Gadgets

A staggering amount of people, especially teens, are addicted to smart phones. This increased usage of smart phones has led to a lot of physical and psychological effects that are harmful for the well-being of these individuals. This issue is so serious that a word has been invented just for it: Nomophobia. This term is given to phone addicts that completely lose their mind when they are away from their phones.

 The smart phone was invented to keep us connected to the world, our friends, and family. However, its over-use has become a major reason of keeping us disconnected from our real relations. This misuse of technology has severe consequences, among which the most prominent symptoms are given below.

Increased Levels of Stress – People that compulsively check their phones every minute are extremely addicted to it. Their mind and body constantly remains under stress due to their habit of checking their phones after short intervals.

Insomnia – Constantly checking your phone and keeping it next to your pillow is doing more damage than you ever imagined. Letting your phone usage invade your sleep is one of the worst thing you are doing to your mind and body. This over-use of technology may lead to stress, less productivity, lower energy levels, difficulty concentrating, and lower brain activity. When we make use of phones at night, melatonin mistakes the artificial light for daytime. As a result, we find it hard to sleep which causes various sleeping disorders including insomnia.

Anxiety – The anxiousness that comes by hearing a small ping causes severe anxiety. The constant urge of checking the phone and finding no message on it results in stress. People using smartphones feel socially obligated to stay connected to social networks, which keeps them hooked to the device, giving them no time to relax.

Depression – People that are addicted to their phones find it hard to stay away from them. Such people then feel strong withdrawal symptoms when they cannot have their phones including severe depression.

Aggressiveness – The people that constantly use their phones are unable to look away from them. In some cases, the addiction is so bad that people feel angry when their phone is taken away from them. A great number of teens do not let anyone touch their phones. When they lose their phones, they show signs of aggression which results in mood swings, feelings of unhappiness, and irritation.

Delinquency – Addiction to smart phones can make a person careless and cause several behavioral issues. Many people are so addicted to their phones that they can’t keep it away while driving, eating, studying, talking to someone, etc. which leads to many other problems with authorities.

Compulsive Behavior – An inability to stop using the smart phone despite knowing you will be faced with negative consequences. Children and teens that cover a greater percentage of phone addicts often fail to understand the consequences that this over-use of technology may have on their lives.

Difficulties in Relating with Others – Addiction to smart phones often cause relationships and friendships to end. As a result, people around the cell phone addict feel upset. For example, using a smartphone while on a date with your significant other might make them infuriated. By using our phones, we disconnect ourselves from the real world, which is a huge problem that causes relationship problems.

Craving More Phone-time – Phone addicts usually can’t have enough of their phones, which is why they can’t put it away for even a second. At night, many phone users keep themselves forcefully awake to use their phones to chat, socialize, watch videos, and play games.

–While attending an event or social gathering, cell phone addicts are engrossed in their phones instead of conversing with the people around them. Adolescents are most affected by phones and parents complain about their excessive use and often confiscate them as a form of punishment. Smart phone addiction can cause fights, arguments, and even loss of relationships.

Changes in Sleep Patterns – Phone usage at nighttime has been linked to disturbed sleeping patterns by several medical experts and researchers. Smart phone addicts generally sleep less than seven hours per night, which causes several health risks including diabetes, heart problems, depression, inability to concentrate, poor memory, inactive mind, and learning problems.

Shunning Healthy Activities – Smart phone addicts often fail to take part in healthy activities like walking, socializing, sports, etc. Socialization suffers greatly. Children prefer playing video instead of going out in a natural setting with friends. They choose virtual games rather than actual games with actual people.

Smart phone technology was created to serve us in a positive way, to connect us to the world, and to help us explore. However, this technology has been put to the wrong uses and many of us are getting addicted to it.

Do you see your behaviors and/or illnesses in the smart phone addiction list above?

There are real dangers to smart phone addiction including prominent physical and mental disorders. It is important to manage your smart phone use and avoid exploiting the technology and allowing the technology to exploit you.

Here are some simple things you can do immediately to lessen the effects of the machine world on your personal human world. Remember, machines at this point in evolution, are not our friends; they are our slaves. And if we are not careful, we will become their slaves.
• Keep the phone away from the body whenever possible. Carry it in a purse or briefcase instead of touching your body
• Reduce cell phone use when the signal is weak or when you’re in a fast-moving car or bus because phones put off more radio frequency energy at those times
• Reduce the use of cell phones streaming audio or video
• Keep the phone seven feet away from your body at night
• Use headsets or speaker mode to avoid holding the phone to your head

Why are we so willing to jump into the virtual realm and give ourselves, our time, our money, and our life over to the novel, the mysterious, the magical effects of the digital world of machines and technology?

We have already pointed out that the use of machines is as ancient as those made to accept temple coinage. Machine technology continued throughout history with man’s desire to make an automaton that to do his bidding, a form of master-slave relationships where the slave is a machine. That trend continues today and is even more pronounced as robots are being used for work that was once left to low-paid workers and slaves. An overview of history reminds us that strides towards automation has deep roots.

In the mid-8th century, wind-powered automata were built which were human-like statues that turned with the wind overlooking the city of Baghdad. The Abbasid palaces had automata of various types and were predominantly displayed. Jābir ibn Hayyān (Geber) included recipes for constructing artificial snakes, scorpions, and humans that would be subject to their creator’s control in his coded Book of Stones. In 827, Caliph Al-Ma’mun had a silver and golden tree in his palace in Baghdad, with metal birds that sang and flapped their wings. In the 9th century, the Banū Mūsā brothers invented a programmable automatic flute player which they described in their Book of Ingenious Devices.

Al-Jazari described complex programmable humanoid automata amongst other machines he designed and constructed in the Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices in 1206. His automaton was a boat with four automatic musicians that floated on a lake to entertain guests at royal drinking parties. His mechanism had a programmable drum machine with pegs (cams) that bump into little levers that operate the percussion. The drummer could be made to play different rhythms and drum patterns if the pegs were moved around. The automata were a robot band which performed more than fifty facial and body actions during each musical selection.

Al-Jazari constructed a hand washing automaton first employing the flush mechanism now used in modern toilets. It features a female automaton standing by a basin filled with water. When the user pulls the lever, the water drains and the automaton refills the basin. His “peacock fountain” was another more sophisticated hand washing device featuring humanoid automata as servants who offer soap and towels.

Samarangana Sutradhara, a Sanskrit treatise by Bhoja (11th century), includes a chapter about the construction of mechanical contrivances (automata), including mechanical bees and birds, fountains shaped like humans and animals, and male and female dolls that refilled oil lamps, danced, played instruments, and re-enacted scenes from Hindu mythology.

There are many examples of automata in Greek mythology: Hephaestus created automata for his workshop; Taloswas an artificial man of bronze. Daedalus used quicksilver to install voice in his moving statues. King Alkinous of the Phaiakians employed gold and silver watchdogs.

The automata in the Hellenistic world were intended as tools, toys, religious idols, or prototypes for demonstrating basic scientific principles. Numerous water powered

automata were built by Ktesibios, a Greek inventor and the first head of the Great Library of Alexandria, for example he “used water to sound a whistle and make a model owl move. He had invented the world’s first cuckoo clock. This tradition continued in Alexandria with inventors such as the Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria (sometimes known as Heron), whose writings on hydraulics, pneumatics, and mechanics described siphons, a fire engine, a water organ, the aeolipile, and a programmable cart.

In 2010, DeepMind Technologies Limited, a British artificial intelligence company was founded to create the first artificial intelligence. The company was acquired by Google in 2014. DeepMind created a neural network that learns how to play video games in a fashion similar to that of humans, as well as a Neural Turing machine, or a neural network, that may be able to access an external memory like a conventional Turing machine, resulting in a computer that mimics the short-term memory of the human brain. After Google’s acquisition, the company established an artificial intelligence ethics board. DeepMind, together with Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft, is a founding member of Partnership on AI, an organization devoted to the society-AI interface.

DeepMind Technologies’ goal is to “solve intelligence”, which they are trying to achieve by combining “the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful general-purpose learning algorithms.” They are trying to formalize intelligence to not only implement it into machines, but also understand the human brain. DeepMind claims that their system is not pre-programmed: it learns from experience, using only raw pixels as data input. Technically it uses deep learning on a convolutional neural network, with a novel form of Q-learning, a form of model-free reinforcement learning. They test the system on video games. Without altering the code, the AI begins to understand how to play the game, and after some time plays, for a few games a more efficient game than any human ever could.

DeepMind is the foundation upon which will be built autonomous robots that can learn. Right now, only DeepMind is officially an “artificial intelligence.” Though you hear references to other AI frequently, those are simply series of sub-routines connecting through software. DeepMind on the other hand, is demonstrating self-generated machine intelligence that can grow on its own. Once DeepMind was loaded up with every bit of digital information that the team could find, the inventors asked DeepMind what it thought about human beings.

Remember, DeepMind is machine intelligence which is the opposite of human intelligence. DeepMind’s prime directive is to keep humans as animals in a zoo – a human zoo filled with machine intelligence taking over our lives.

The next step in weaponized military innovation is an autonomous robot that will do the bidding of the programmer without the mess of human morality or human intelligence questioning the bidding of the bosses. Google (Alphabet) owns the company that won the DARPA contract to make the robot warriors. Of course, no one is asking the obvious question, “Isn’t this the time that the robot armies take over the world in every sci-fi movie about the future?” The answer to that proverbial question is: YES. Just keep watching the Tech Warlord Eric Schmidt and you will see him taking war into the robot warrior stage of human devolution.

The Atlas robot has frankly scared us since its inception. Watching the chain of ownership of this “invention” is like watching the rat-trails of Silicon Valley that always lead back to DARPA, In-Q-Tel, and the Highlands Forum. The warmongers and venture capitalists feed the innovations of Silicon Valley and the fake Tech Lords make out like bandits.

Atlas is a bipedal humanoid robot primarily developed by the American robotics company Boston Dynamics (Alphabet), with funding and oversight from the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The six-foot tall robot is designed for a variety of search and rescue tasks, and was unveiled to the public on July 11, 2013. The design and production of Atlas was overseen by the DARPA, an agency of the United States Department of Defense, in cooperation with Boston Dynamics.

Atlas is based on Boston Dynamics’ earlier PETMAN humanoid robot, and has four hydraulically-actuated limbs. Constructed of aluminum and titanium, it weighs 330

pounds, and is illuminated with blue LEDs. Atlas is equipped with two vision systems – a laser rangefinder and stereo cameras, both controlled by an off-board computer – and has hands with fine motor skill capabilities. Atlas can navigate rough terrain and climb independently using its arms and legs. The robot can withstand being hit by projectiles and balance on one leg.

In 2014, Atlas robots programmed by six different teams competed in the DARPA Robotics Challenge to test the robot’s ability to perform various tasks, including getting in and out of a vehicle and driving it, opening a door, and using a power tool.

The new version of Atlas is designed to operate both outdoors and inside buildings. It is specialized for mobile manipulation and is very adept at walking over a wide range of terrain, including snow. It is electrically powered and hydraulically actuated. It uses sensors in its body and legs to balance, and it uses stereo sensors in its head to avoid obstacles, assess the terrain, help with navigation, and manipulate objects, even when the objects are being moved.

Atlas can also run, jump, and even turn 180 degrees while jumping and performing a backflip. In the 2015 DARPA competition of robotics Atlas completed all eight tasks as follows:
• Climb an industrial ladder and traverse an industrial walkway.
• Use a tool to break through a concrete panel.
• Connect a fire hose to a standpipe and turn on a valve.

Atlas is a step toward the long-anticipated age of humanoid robots. We are seeing the creation of a new species, Robo sapiens. The question is, “Have we birthed the human-like automaton, or our demise?” Only time will tell.

Brave New World is Now

Atlas and the other innovations driven by the desire to weaponize patents are the harbingers of our machine-like future. Humans intelligence cannot keep up with technological innovation and there is no time scheduled to ask the important questions about the non-stop invasion into human life via machines. We have seen in this article that humans are not doing so well with machines and their inherent effects upon health and wellness. Soon, we may be welcoming Atlas and his mechanical offspring into our homes, our jobs, and the political machinations of war.

We are in a war with machines and it looks like we are losing. People will not put down their smart phones and computers to ask basic questions about what costs are associated with all of this “sucked-up” time and energy spent on the Internet and computers. Even if the dangers and illnesses caused by tech-addiction are screamed from every roof-top, we wonder if people will take out their ear-buds, put down their phones and listen. Perhaps we should develop an app for the smart phone that might be able to get the WARNING through the unconscious user.

The time is coming when humans must decide between human thinking and machine intelligence. No machine will ever be able to understand a wisdom-filled human thought. No human will ever be able to live in the realm of machine intelligence. These two realms are diametrically opposed to each other and will never meet without serious consequences.

Machines live and work in a realm that humans may not enter accept through the sacrifice of our own warmth, intelligence, and life. Hard, cold machines are the creation of human thinking attempting to make a machine in the likeness of the human being. So far, we have failed to understand the nature of human and machine intelligence and mistakenly attribute similarities that do not exist. Have we created a digital liberator or a machine Frankenstein?

Humans and machines must learn to work together in a healthy and interconnected fashion that brings the best of humanity into a realm devoid of warmth and life. Once consciousness brings to light to the true effects of machines on the human being, we can build a foundation upon which a rich and rewarding conversation can begin that brings the right balance between human thought and machine intelligence that promotes healthy human development and morally centered technology.

629,"If you have diabetes, here’s a way to keep standing on your own two feet: check them every day—even if they feel fine—and see your doctor if you have a cut or blister that won’t heal.

There’s a lot to manage if you have diabetes: checking your blood sugar, making healthy food, finding time to be active, taking medicines, going to doctor’s appointments. With all that, your feet might be the last thing on your mind. But daily care is one of the best ways to prevent foot complications.

About half of all people with diabetes have some kind of diabetic neuropathyexternal icon (nerve damage). You can have nerve damage in any part of your body, but nerves in your feet and legs are most often affected. Nerve damage can cause you to lose feeling in your feet.

Some people with nerve damage have numbness, tingling, or pain, but others have no symptoms. Nerve damage can also lower your ability to feel pain, heat, or cold.

Living without pain sounds pretty good, but it comes at a high cost. Pain is the body’s way of telling you something’s wrong so you can take care of yourself. If you don’t feel pain in your feet, you may not notice a cut, blister, sore, or other problem. Small problems can become serious if they aren’t treated early.

Could You Have Nerve Damage?

Anyone with diabetes can develop nerve damage, but these factors increase your risk:
• Blood sugar levels that are hard to manage
• Having diabetes for a long time, especially if your blood sugar is often higher than your target levels

Nerve damage, along with poor blood flow—another diabetes complication—puts you at risk for developing a foot ulcer (a sore or wound) that could get infected and not heal well. If an infection doesn’t get better with treatment, your toe, foot, or part of your leg may need to be amputated (removed by surgery) to prevent the infection from spreading and to save your life.

When you check your feet every day, you can catch problems early and get them treated right away. Early treatment greatly reduces your risk of amputation.

Check your feet every day for cuts, redness, swelling, sores, blisters, corns, calluses, or any other change to the skin or nails. Use a mirror if you can’t see the bottom of your feet, or ask a family member to help.

Wash your feet every day in warm (not hot) water. Don’t soak your feet. Dry your feet completely and apply lotion to the top and bottom—but not between your toes, which could lead to infection.

Never go barefoot. Always wear shoes and socks or slippers, even inside, to avoid injury. Check that there aren’t any pebbles or other objects inside your shoes and that the lining is smooth.

Wear shoes that fit well. For the best fit, try on new shoes at the end of the day when your feet tend to be largest. Break in your new shoes slowly—wear them for an hour or two a day at first until they’re completely comfortable. Always wear socks with your shoes.

Trim your toenails straight across and gently smooth any sharp edges with a nail file. Have your foot doctor (podiatrist) trim your toenails if you can’t see or reach your feet.

Don’t remove corns or calluses yourself, and especially don’t use over-the-counter products to remove them—they could burn your skin.

Get your feet checked at every health care visit. Also, visit your foot doctor every year (more often if you have nerve damage) for a complete exam, which will include checking for feeling and blood flow in your feet.

Keep the blood flowing. Put your feet up when you’re sitting, and wiggle your toes for a few minutes several times throughout the day.

Choose feet-friendly activities like walking, riding a bike, or swimming. Check with your doctor about which activities are best for you and any you should avoid.

Be sure to ask your doctor what else you can do to keep your feet healthy.

When to See Your Doctor

If you experience any of these symptoms, don’t wait for your next appointment. See your regular doctor or foot doctor right away:
• Pain in your legs or cramping in your buttocks, thighs, or calves during physical activity.
• Tingling, burning, or pain in your feet.
• Loss of sense of touch or ability to feel heat or cold very well.
• A change in the shape of your feet over time.
• Loss of hair on your toes, feet, and lower legs.
• A change in the color and temperature of your feet.
• Fungus infections such as athlete’s foot between your toes.

Most people with diabetes can prevent serious foot complications. Regular care at home and going to all doctor’s appointments are your best bet for preventing foot problems (and stopping small problems from becoming serious ones).",mainstream
1294,"FLORENCE, Ala. (AP) — They don’t call him “Big Foot” for nothing.

Florence resident John Aikin’s size 14 feet have run thousands of miles. Exactly how many, he hasn’t kept count.

On April 15, the newly retired Senators Coaches vice-president is taking to the streets of Boston for his 100th marathon — his 21st Boston Marathon, the most coveted and prestigious of all 26.2 mile races.

“I always said I wanted to run my 100th marathon on my 100th birthday, but I got a little ahead of schedule,” he joked, adding that it’s looking like he may run his 200th marathon on his 100th birthday.

Aikin, who turned 66 on Friday, said people frequently ask what’s the secret to his running longevity.

“The secret is to just stay alive,” he said. “I’ve been really fortunate to never have had injuries to keep me from running. About 20 years ago I had a stress fracture but other than that I’ve been pretty much bulletproof.”

Aikin, along with his long-time running pal, Kenneth Williams, of Corinth, Mississippi, has run marathons all over the U.S. and Europe. He has run in Ireland, Austria, Germany, Italy and Switzerland.

Aikin did his first race in 1988 and stuck to short races, 5k’s and 10k’s until 1995 when he ran his first marathon in Jackson, Tennessee.

He recalls feeling good early on in that race, so good he held about a six-minute pace for the first half. Then came mile 19.

“I can only describe it as a crash and burn,” he said. “I had to be driven back in.”

He learned over the next several marathons to pace himself better. By 1997 when he ran his first Boston Marathon he did exceptionally well, setting a personal best record of three hours, 13 minutes, 26 seconds.

That was the same year he got his nickname, “Big Foot.”

“The guy running beside me had a jacket on that said “Jersey Joe” and everyone, all along the course, yelled at him the whole way as he ran by,” Aikin recalled. “I decided I wanted people to cheer for me like that. I was “Big Foot John” so I started wearing a shirt that said that at all my marathons. I’ll have it on at the start in Boston on April 15.”

Aikin said he always runs his fastest times in Boston, despite weather or any other obstacle.

He even ran well six years ago when tragedy struck the Boston Marathon at the finish line with the bombing.

Aikin had finished the race prior to the explosion and had gone to his hotel to shower. His friend Kenneth was still on the course, actually due to finish around the same time the bombing occurred but a knee injury slowed his pace and he was just less than a mile away.

“I ran up on about 75 runners just stopped in the middle of the road and they said they’d been told there was some kind of explosion,” Williams said. “I knew John had already finished, he just didn’t know about me.”

With a dead cellphone, Williams said he was able to borrow a phone to call his wife.

That was the day the Boston Marathon changed forever, as security has become tighter than ever. Even the race format has changed, especially with pre-race activities that had always taken place at the Athletes’ Village.

Still, both men say the Boston Marathon remains their favorite of the 30 marathons they’ve done together.

Williams said he’s proud of his friend for reaching his 100th mark and said he’s Aikin’s biggest cheerleader.

“He’s a strong runner and has been so fortunate not to have any injuries or issues to slow him down,” Williams said. “100 marathons is a mammoth accomplishment. John always had the capacity to train slow and race fast. He ran the New York Marathon in 3:12, when he was already well into his 60s.”

Williams said he does hold a record in one category that puts him ahead of his friend: consecutively run Boston Marathons.

“I have 16 consecutive of my 17 and he skipped some years,” he said. “One year he forgot to register and ran as a bandit. I think I still get the blame for him not being registered for that race.”

Aikin said he depends on Williams for his attention to detail.

Williams laughs as he describes that aspect of their relationship as “me knowing what I’ll be doing two weeks from now and John being the more spontaneous one.”

As for being an older runner, Aikin said there are perks to that, too. His Boston qualifying time is much more lenient at age 66 at 4:10 than it was two decades ago.

“I certainly hope to run it below that time but that’s the beauty of Boston — it’s always unpredictable,” Aikin said.

“I haven’t ever placed in my age group at Boston, but that’s OK because the best marathoners in the world are there and I’m just happy to be amongst them on my 100th. I’ll just do my smile-check at mile 22 and I’ll know it’s a good day.”",mainstream
347,"The year 2019 is almost here and as 2018 comes to an end new energies are making their way towards each and every one of us. While you might not yet realize it the year to come has a lot in store for you.

While you might currently be feeling down in the dumps and a bit upset as we near mid-December you will soon be perking right back up. The year to come is going to be pushing us all to really get things done and allow our emotions to move freely. You might be able to reach your goals this year or depending on your birth month you could end up finding the love of your life.

Below I am going to go over what is in store those born during each month. Sure, some months will be getting more positive aspects than others but in the end, everyone will be reaping the benefits that this year has to offer be it one way or another. Don’t let the negative side of things get you down, just remember that each and every situation we come to in this life is something we are meant to learn from. What does your birth month have to say about 2019 for you?

What You Should Expect In 2019 Based On Your Birth Month:

If you were born in January, 2019 is going to have you feeling quite optimistic. You are going to be trusting more and taking the time to give back to the people who matter most in your life. While you spent most of 2018 obsessing over yourself and refusing to see reality as it truly is, 2019 is going to open your eyes.

You are going to be putting yourself out there and chasing your dreams. That being said, you also need to remember that celebrating too early will not get things done. First, you do the work and then you get the cake. This year you need to follow your heart and allow it to guide you towards whatever and whoever is best for your emotional well-being.

If you were born in February, 2019 is going to be really bringing out the emotional side within you. It is going to feel like you are falling apart for a good while but once you figure things out you will be able to overcome this. You have to really bring yourself to truly understand how important your own emotions are and stop giving too much to those who only wish to use you.

You are going to be focusing your attention on your relationships and home life. While you should spend some time thinking about work and your financial situation you just can’t bring yourself to do-so. You are going to be very preoccupied this year and working through some things that you have been needing to work through.

If you were born in March 2019 you will be working with the best intentions but getting nowhere. For you 2019 might feel like quite the rut. You are doing things backward and not getting anywhere. During the first few months you will be spending a lot of time soul searching but will be unable to find what you’re looking for.

While nearing the end of this year will look better for you, it will be a year without movement. You are going to be ignoring the needs of those around you and really trying to work things out. If you can bring yourself to question things quicker you might be able to get some kind of productiveness out of the year 2019. Just be careful, things are not always as they seem.

If you were born in April, 2019 you are going to be spending a lot of your 2019 working hard and trying to get things done. You have a lot of things that need to be worked through and money seems to be quite sparse at the moment. The harder you work the further you will get but you also should not let your own wellbeing fall through the cracks.

There will be many positive pushes coming your way and many encouraging you from the sidelines. While this year will be a tough one it will be one that brings you towards your goals. There are no shortcuts when it comes to success and you know that all too well.

If you were born in May, 2019 is going to bring out the emotional side within you. You are going to suffer great loss during this year and you are also not going to be reaping the benefits of all of those kind deeds you’ve done throughout 2018. While you should be out chasing your dreams and getting things done instead you will be locking yourself away.

Perhaps changing career paths will be enough to get you out of this slump? You won’t know unless you try. This is something you’ve been thinking about for a long time, maybe now is your chance?

If you were born in June, 2019 is going to be setting your own standards and having you refusing to settle. You are not going to be taking any chances as the months pass by. You know what you want and what you do not. You are about to find your calling and it is nothing like what you would have expected it to be.

You are always so full of life and are going to be celebrating for quite some time once all is said and done. You are always working hard and really deserve the good things 2019 is going to offer you. Sure, you like freedom but you also really like the things that are about to be before you as well. Which is more important?

If you were born in July, 2019 you are going to be finding abundance for once. The past few years you have been far more reckless than you should have been and you have burned bridges with a lot of people who meant the world to you. During 2019 you need to work on building yourself up and getting on stable ground.

While things will not be as easy as you want them to be they will come with their own messages. If you take the time to apologize to the people who matter most and really begin putting your best foot forward you can really become the person that you always wanted to be.

If you were born in August, 2019 is going to break you down in several ways. While I cannot go into what those ways entail I can tell you that they do not come without reason. You need to work on making improvements to yourself and your life. While you are going to be finding someone that you’ve been missing this year you also are going to go through hardship.

During this time you should push yourself out of your comfort zone and address things that come your way head on. You are going to be working to find harmony and really setting your own intentions. Don’t waste any of this year, make the most of it.

If you were born in September, 2019 is going to bring you to a point in your life where you need to let go of your emotional baggage. You are the kind of person to carry all of your issues with you and never allow the past to be buried. That is not healthy and needs to change.

Throughout the year you are going to be learning more and more about the people you’ve lost touch with. This might be your last chance to change and you need to take it. While you’re not necessarily used to making your way through destruction now is the time to learn how to do so. You’re stronger than you think, you can’t run from your problems forever.

If you were born in October, 2019 you are going to be spending this year determined to make sure your dreams come true. You are going to be working hard and getting things done. During this time you need to be cautious of others and quick to cut out toxic individuals.

While the people in your life might pretend to be there for you, they are only using you. You need to stop letting people who only hold you back have power over you. Sure, they are important to you but you are not important to them. Take the time to realize these things and your 2019 will be overwhelmingly positive.

If you were born in November, 2019 you are going to really need to begin believing in yourself and working towards success. While your high standards will become lowered you will also begin to understand why you do the things you do.

Patience is very important this year, make sure you do things the right way and do not take shortcuts. While postponing things might not always feel the best sometimes it is necessary. Sure, things don’t have to be perfect but you need to get them done properly. Maintaining a realistic outlook in this life will get you further than you think.

If you were born in December, 2019 is going to be a year in which you finally get back on track but also have to face lots of rough points. While the path to where you want to be is not the easiest to walk on you can do it. You are going to be making lots of progress this year.

Sure, you won’t get everything done but you will be well on your way. Perhaps this will be the year where when everything is going wrong something very big will go right. Keep your chin up, you have everything under control.",conspiracy
411,"President Donald Trump has had one of the most successful first years in office of any president in the history of America.

I know this because White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said as much Tuesday: “I don’t think anyone can argue it’s probably one of the most successful first years in office.”

Since nobody can argue it, I’m not going to try. Besides, spending five minutes Googling the concrete factual evidence that would disprove that claim is a waste of five minutes that could be spent honoring the unrivaled greatness of our president.

Speaking of Trump’s greatness, did you know he has made it so nobody dies in commercial airline crashes anymore? On Tuesday, the president tweeted: “Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation. Good news — it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017, the best and safest year on record!”

That’s fantastic! What’s even more amazing is the report Trump is citing was for global air travel, meaning the many actions he did not take to increase commercial aviation safety in America also helped travelers in every other country in the world! And here in America, we went from zero commercial airline deaths in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to an even-more-impressive zero commercial airline deaths in 2017!

That’s what I call strong leadership. Speaking of which, did you know our supremely confident president has increased the size of America’s famously non-existent Nuclear Button, making it bigger than North Korea’s Nuclear Button?

Well, he has. Late Tuesday, Trump sent the following trouser-soiling tweet: “North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the ‘Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.’ Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!”

WOO-HOOO! At long last, we have an extremely secure and manly president unafraid to boast about the great size and power of our national desk-mounted nuke button, which I’m sure is really a thing despite no credible evidence to suggest it exists.

Of course the president hasn’t tweeted about all his accomplishments. He’s far too humble and fantastic, and also too busy accomplishing more than any president in history.

But you can easily identify the many things you should be thanking President Trump for by applying this simple two-part rule:

1) If it happened any time after Inauguration Day 2017 and it was good, President Trump is responsible for it.

2) On the off chance it’s something not good, President Trump is responsible for it only if it can be framed in a way that makes it seem good.

For example, the Chicago area had its coldest New Year’s Day high temperature on record and by Saturday the city will likely tie a decades-old record for consecutive days below 20 degrees.

Donald Trump is clearly responsible for these wonderfully cold temperatures and for helping Chicago break records! You never saw cold-weather records broken under President Barack Obama, and if Crooked Hillary Clinton had been elected, it would likely be 80 degrees and sunny in Chicago right now.

Trump’s conviction that global warming is a hoax has forced temperatures to drop, giving Chicagoans the enviable status of “record breakers.”

Another important improvement over past administrations: The total number of verified Bigfoot-related deaths in 2017 fell to zero, a comforting and substantial improvement over the less-impressive zero Bigfoot-related deaths that occurred during all other American presidents’ first years.

So what do we have after only one short year of the single greatest presidential administration in the history of presidential greatness? We have, inarguably, the most successful first year in office, with Zero deaths from plane crashes and a Nuclear Button so big it could in no way be interpreted as an overcompensation for something tragically small. We have Chicago being made great again with record-breaking cold weather and a precipitous drop in the number of people killed by Sasquatch.

We have a booming economy, with the S&P 500 up an unprecedented and certainly record-breaking 18 percent in Trump’s first 11 month’s in office, compared with the S&P 500 going up a mere 36.9 percent during Obama’s first 11 months. (Any suggestion that 36.9 is a larger number than 18 is FAKE NEWS.)

The bottom line is this: I don’t think anyone can argue with how well everything is going in America.

Have you noticed how every American who is alive is breathing? I imagine we’ll soon see a Trump tweet celebrating this fantastic news: “Since taking office I have been very strict on human beings breathing. Good news — it was just reported that all living human beings were breathing in 2017. I am amazing and this is all thanks to me! #MAGA.”

339,"The perils of surfing were again in evidence in South Africa on Monday when the 11-time world champion, Kelly Slater, sustained a badly broken foot in between rounds at the World Surf League’s Corona Open J-Bay.

Slater was free surfing at Boneyards when he pulled out of a barrel and was struck by his board, breaking two metatarsal bones in his right foot. The injury is expected to sideline him for six weeks, ruling him out of contention at Jeffrey’s Bay and the next stop of the tour, the Billabong Pro Tahiti.

Slater took to Instagram to reveal the extent of the injury and post an x-ray of his shattered foot. “Have you ever folded your entire foot backwards?” he wrote. “Kinda like smashing my foot with a big hammer as hard as I can. Sorta feels like I’m giving birth out of my foot right now.” He added that he expected to have to undergo surgery on his foot.

Slater had appeared in good form in beating Julian Wilson and Kanoa Igarashi in the opening round, to win through directly to round three. But it was Filipe Toledo who stole the show on his return from a ban for attempting to storm the judges’ tower in Rio, laying down the benchmark with a 9.63 ride followed by a perfect 10 to see off Igarashi in the second round.

The Brazilian was supposed to meet Slater next, but will now progress from the third round without having to take to the water.

Australia’s Wilson secured his safe passage from the second round with victory over compatriot Josh Kerr while Owen Wright beat Ethan Ewing to boost the number of Australians in the third round.

“It feels nice to get going and get that round two out of the way,” Wright said. “It was a scrappy heat but it played out to my advantage. I felt like it was going to be a slow one so I knew I needed to get going. When you don’t get the best wave of the heat it’s tough to come back.”

J-Bay title holder Mick Fanning, who famously survived an altogether different kind of peril in the South African water two years ago, is one of that number, and faces another Brazilian, Caio Ibelli.",mainstream

Massive Raising of Atlantic Ocean Bed Triggers Current Changes As North American Plate Pressures Build To ‘Unprecedented Levels’ Scientists Report

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Russian Subscribers

Reports being circulated by Russian Scientists today are suggesting that a massive ‘anomalous’ event is occurring in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean Region suggesting an ‘extreme alteration’ of the Atlantic Ocean Bed itself, or as some Scientists are suggesting, that a new Atlantic Ocean Island is about to form.

Of the main effects being felt by the raising of the Atlantic Ocean Bed are the alterations to its current flows, and as we can read as exampled by the British Telegraph News Service in their article titled ""Surfers search for wave that went missing"" and which says, ""A famous European surfing beach has mysteriously lost its waves, to the consternation of locals and dismay of surfers, who fear that a ""wonder of the world"" has vanished forever. Surfers flock in their thousands to Mundaka, on Spain's north Atlantic coast, to master its enormous tube-like roller - a giant often reaching more than 20 feet. Now anyone arriving to catch the ""Basque wave"" will find themselves riding no more than a ripple. The Basque government has dispatched scientists and academics to find a solution.""

On the American side of the Atlantic Ocean we can also see the effects of these massive current changes in the reporting of the first deaths in history due to riptides in their New England Region, and as we can read as reported by the Boston Globe News Service in their article titled ""Riptide claims two lives at beach"" and which says;

""Two Massachusetts men drowned and a 10-year-old boy was taken to the hospital yesterday evening after a riptide pulled swimmers out to sea at Hampton Beach, according to hospital and emergency officials. Authorities said as many as 12 people were swept out about 6 p.m. The Hampton Fire Department responded with a 34-foot boat and the Coast Guard dispatched two 25-foot boats and a helicopter. ''We've never had beach conditions like that before,"" said lifeguard captain James DeLuca. ''They were swimming in a bad area after the lifeguards went off duty."" Authorities said they couldn't remember another case of a riptide drowning at the beach.""

The alterations of these Atlantic Ocean currents are also responsible for the devastation wrecked upon the New England Regions fishing industries due to their recent Red Tide disaster, and as we can read as reported by the Associated Press News Service in their article titled ""Romney declares red tide a disaster for Massachusetts"" and which says;

""Gov. Mitt Romney on Thursday declared a state of emergency because of the red tide bloom off the coast of Massachusetts, allowing the state to seek federal disaster aid for the shellfish industry.”I have declared a state of emergency, and am seeking disaster relief,"" he said. Red tide is the result of algae that contaminate shellfish and can be dangerous to humans who eat the shellfish. The heavy bloom this year was pushed by unusually strong north and northeast winds into Massachusetts Bay, where it thrived in warmer waters. The growth around Cape Cod and forced its way through the Cape Cod Canal for the first time. The bloom has closed down about two thirds of Massachusetts shell fishing flats, and is expected to persist through what is traditionally the peak shell fishing season leading to the July 4th holiday.""

The significance of the Atlantic current changes being responsible for the massive outbreaks of Red Tide can be found in the research being conducted by the Rhode Island Sea Grant Organization and as stated in their Research Paper titled ""Red Tide in the Northeast"" and which says, ""The organism that causes toxic red tide in New England is a microscopic one-celled alga called Alexandrium tamarense. Alexandrium propels itself through the water using two tiny whip-like extensions called flagella. Its life cycle includes a dormant cyst stage that can survive cold winters in bottom sediments. The cysts, which also contain toxin, are the seeds for future blooms. These cysts facilitate the spread of toxic red tides into new areas since they are easily transported by tidal currents, dredge material disposal, and transplanted shellfish.""

As the massive Ocean Current Changes occurring around the world, and not just to the Atlantic Ocean alone, reawakening these buried cysts, the world’s scientists are speculating that worst changes may be on the way, and as we can read as reported by the Boston Globe News Service in their article titled ""Scientists wonder if algae bloom is a red flag"", and which says; ""As Massachusetts officials scramble for disaster relief for shellfish farmers strapped by the worst bloom of red tide in decades, scientists are trying to figure out weather the toxic algae explosion hints at an ecological disaster. Red Tides appear to be on the increase world-wide...""

Not just to these changing Ocean Currents but also to the continuing massively building pressure being built up upon the North American Plate are Russian Scientists concerned about, even to the point where the internal stresses of this tectonic plate are building up such pressures that the Great Lakes of the United States are now heating up, and as we can read as reported by the American All Headline News Service in their article titled ""Great Lakes Reach Mysterious Temperature High"" and which says;

""Water temperatures in the lower Great Lakes are at a 5-year high, mysteriously measuring now where they were in mid-August of last year. Rochelle Sturtevant, a systems ecologist with the Great Lakes Sea Grant Network says researchers might not make sense of current temperature data for months or even years...""

But not to anything ‘mysterious’ is the heating of these Great Lakes as it has long been known that the heating of such large bodies of waters are but precursors to much larger geological events, and as exampled by the current events occurring in Japan, and as we can read as reported by the British Register News Service in their article titled “Volcano erupts underwater, boils ocean"" and which says;

""A volcano has erupted underwater near the Pacific island of Iwo Jima off the coast of Japan, sending a column of steam rising a kilometre into the air. The Japanese Coast Guard sent a plane to investigate, according to reports, after Defence officials reported that the surface of the water appeared red in the region of the steam column. Larger eruptions in the area have been recorded three times in the last 100 years, each eruption large enough to form a new, but quite small, island, according to a paper from the American Geophysical Union.""

Of the warnings being issued to the Americans about the imminent dangers they are facing we can see little of on a National Level, but to a smaller extent the warnings of both Russian and American Scientists are being sounded, and as we can see exampled by the St. Louis Post Dispatch News Service in their article titled ""Bracing for the Big One"" and which says;

""Two-thirds of the way between St. Louis and Memphis, between the towns of Tiptonville, Tenn., and New Madrid, Mo., the Mississippi River makes an outrageous loop northward, like it's avoiding something. The river's levees dead-end at a bulge in the landscape. For decades, geologists have studied this gentle swell in the cornfields. They have a name for it: the Reelfoot fault.

In the winter of 1811-12, this is where two blocks in the earth wrenched apart so savagely - the western block up, the eastern block down - that the Mississippi River pooled backward into the sunken block. The river, cutting and silting away, has done its best to hide the scar. ""The fact that it's there at all means it has been deforming and growing faster than the Mississippi River has been eroding it,"" said Arch Johnston, director of the Center for Earthquake Research and Information at the University of Memphis.

Research published June 23 in the journal Nature shows that the fault is coiling up like a spring again - at a rate comparable to the San Andreas fault in California. Geologists know that huge New Madrid earthquakes happened in the past. Now, for the first time, they can say the Reelfoot fault is building up a pressure that could make it buckle again.""

But perhaps most ominous of all of these events has been the American Scientists recent confirming Russian research that details the effects of weather upon fault zones like New Madrid, and as we can read as reported by the New Scientist News Service in their report titled ""Earth trembles as big winds move in"" and which says;

""HURRICANES can trigger swarms of weak earthquakes and even set the Earth vibrating, according to the first study of such effects.When Hurricane Charley slammed into Florida in August 2004, physicist Randall Peters of Mercer University in Macon, Georgia, had a seismometer ready to monitor any vibrations in the Earth's crust. He did so for over 36 hours as Charley travelled briefly over Florida, then slid back out into the Atlantic.

As the hurricane reached land, the seismometer recorded a series of ""micro-tremors"" from the Earth's crust. This happened again as the storm moved back out to sea. Then, as Charley grazed the continental shelf on its way out, it caused a sharp seismic spike. ""I suspect the storm triggered a subterranean landslide,"" says Peters.

More surprisingly, the storm also caused the Earth to vibrate. The planet's surface in the vicinity of the hurricane started moving up and down at several frequencies ranging from 0.9 to 3 millihertz. Such low-frequency vibrations have been detected following large earthquakes, but this is the first time a storm has been found to be the cause.""

Today as more massive low pressure systems are being formed in both the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico Region, and as the Sun itself is ready to unleash more massive flares upon the earths already chaotic weather systems, Russian Scientists report that the greatest danger continues to lie within the very heart of the Americas itself. To the peoples of the however these warnings go unheeded, as if every tomorrow will be like their yesterdays.

489,"For years, those of us who have tried to warn the American public that Big Brother monitors all Internet users were demonized, vilified and ridiculed.

Now, the mainstream media has proven us correct.

“The U.S. government — and likely your own government, for that matter — is either watching your online activity every minute of the day through automated methods and non-human eavesdropping techniques, or has the ability to dip in as and when it deems necessary — sometimes with a warrant, sometimes without,” ZDNet reported earlier this month. “That tin-foil hat really isn’t going to help. Take it off, you look silly.”

Where’s the proof that the government has this capability?

You might recall a fellow by the name of (retired) Gen. David Petraeus. He’s been in the news lately.

This four-star general-turned-CIA chief just resigned his post after news broke that he had engaged in an extra-marital affair with is biographer, herself a West Point graduate and former Army officer.

What led to this shocking discovery was Petraeus’ use, of all things, Google’s online email service, Gmail.

According to federal law, mind you, authorities are not legally permitted to electronically snoop around in your email box.

“The government can’t just wander through your emails just because they’d like to know what you’re thinking or doing,” Stewart Baker, a former assistant secretary at the Homeland Security Department who’s now in private law practice, told The Associated Press. “But if the government is investigating a crime, it has a lot of authority to review people’s emails.”

Or, in the case of the CIA, if the agency wants to track a suspect ostensibly for “national security” purposes. Ditto the NSA.

The wrangling of Petraeus’ email account has certainly landed him in a world of trouble, but his story has also, once again, ignited a new the debate over when, how and why governments and law enforcement agencies alike are able to access the email accounts of ordinary citizens – even if they head up the most powerful spy agency in the world.

Granted, experts say “the little people” needn’t worry much about having their online presence tracked. Agencies like the CIA generally tend to have bigger fish to fry, so to speak. But nevertheless, the technology to pilfer email accounts at will obviously exists.

“Forget ECHELON, or signals intelligence, or the interception of communications by black boxes installed covertly in data centers,” writes Zack Whittaker for ZDNet. “Intelligence agencies and law enforcement bodies can access – thanks to the shift towards Web-based email services in the cloud – but it’s not as exciting or as Jack Bauer-esque as one may think or hope for.”

How the top CIA official got busted

When he set up his private Gmail account, Petraeus used a pseudonym and composed email messages but never sent them. They were instead saved as drafts. His lover, Paula Broadwell, would then log in under the same account, read the drafts then reply to them in the same manner – as a draft, without actually sending the message.

The exchanges would not be sent across the networks through Google’s data centers, which would make it nearly impossible for the NSA or any other ELINT (electronic intelligence) agency (like Britain’s GCHQ or the Israeli Mossad) to “read” the messages while they are in transit between accounts.

Other sinister operators – terrorists, pedophiles and the like – have been known to use the same trick to avoid detection, ZDNet reported.

“But surely IP addresses are logged and noted? When emails are sent and received, yes. But the emails were saved in draft and therefore were not sent. However, Google may still have a record of the IP addresses of those who logged into the account,” the report said.

In the end, the FBI used a little-know law called the Stored Communications Act, which is part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, as the basis for getting a warrant to view Petraeus’ private Gmail account. And that’s how agents found the stored messages that were never actually sent.

“Once it knew Ms. Broadwell was the sender of the threatening messages, the FBI got a warrant that gave it covert access to the anonymous email account,” the BBC’s Mark Ward reported.",conspiracy
300,"The ape-like creature known as Bigfoot in North America needs no introduction. It has been has been seen and reported in Canada and the United States for over two centuries. In 1958, the name ‘Bigfoot’ became famous worldwide thanks to the discovery of large footprints in northern California, earlier it was referred to as ‘gorilla’ or 'wildman' in nineteenth century newspapers and historical accounts. The species, also collectively known as Sasquatch, in addition to different regional names such as Momo or the Ohio Grassman, are described as being anywhere from 7 to 10 ft tall, covered with dark hair except for their faces and palms, with long, sloping arms and huge five-toed feet. They often display behavioural characteristics of apes, such as tree knocking or carrying young ones on their backs. These animals often seem shy and reluctant in most cases to interact with human beings.Although the animal has been seen in every state in the continental United States and in parts of Canada, the Pacific Northwest, encompassing northern California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, is the primary habitat of the species. It was there, at Bluff Creek in California, that the famous Patterson film was taken by Bob Gimlin and Roger Patterson on October 20th, 1967. It’s a film that depicts what many believe to be a female Bigfoot walking quickly away from the area and disappearing in the forest, but not before turning sideways to seemingly stare straight into the camera. The film has been subjected to extensive scrutiny since then, with many sceptics and debunkers attempting to prove that the film is a hoax while many Bigfoot researchers contend that the film is for real and shows a genuine unknown animal. Whatever the truth about the Patterson film may be, the Pacific Northwest remains the epicenter for Bigfoot reports, containing enough forest and woodland area to easily support a population of as of yet undiscovered primates living in the wilderness of America.",mainstream
1228,"Bullous pemphigoid (BUL-us PEM-fih-goid) is a rare skin condition that causes large, fluid-filled blisters. They develop on areas of skin that often flex — such as the lower abdomen, upper thighs or armpits. Bullous pemphigoid is most common in older adults.

Bullous pemphigoid occurs when your immune system attacks a thin layer of tissue below your outer layer of skin. The reason for this abnormal immune response is unknown, although it sometimes can be triggered by taking certain medications.

Bullous pemphigoid often goes away on its own in a few months, but may take as many as five years to resolve. Treatment usually helps heal the blisters and ease any itching. It may include corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, and other drugs that suppress the immune system. Bullous pemphigoid can be life-threatening, especially for older people who are already in poor health.

The signs and symptoms of bullous pemphigoid may include:
• Large blisters that don't easily rupture when touched, often along creases or folds in the skin
• Skin around the blisters that is normal, reddish or darker than normal
• Small blisters or sores in the mouth or other mucous membranes (benign mucous membrane pemphigoid)

When to see a doctor

See your doctor if you develop:

The blisters occur because of a malfunction in your immune system.

Your body's immune system normally produces antibodies to fight bacteria, viruses or other potentially harmful foreign substances. For reasons that are not clear, the body may develop an antibody to a particular tissue in your body.

In bullous pemphigoid, the immune system produces antibodies to the fibers that connect the outer layer of skin (epidermis) and the next layer of skin (dermis). These antibodies trigger inflammation that produces the blisters and itching of bullous pemphigoid.

Bullous pemphigoid usually appears randomly with no clear factors contributing to the onset of disease. Some cases may be triggered by:
• Medications. Prescription drugs that may cause bullous pemphigoid include etanercept (Enbrel), sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), furosemide (Lasix) and penicillin.
• Light and radiation. Ultraviolet light therapy to treat certain skin conditions may trigger bullous pemphigoid, as can radiation therapy to treat cancer.
• Medical conditions. Disorders that may trigger bullous pemphigoid include psoriasis, lichen planus, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis.

Bullous pemphigoid most commonly occurs in older adults, and the risk increases with age.",mainstream
775,"It is fashionable to dismiss reports of an unknown primate as a cultural phenomenon invented by “white, rural men,” as Joshua Blu Buhs does in “Bigfoot” and Florence Williams does in her review (June 7). The 1967 film of the female Bigfoot mentioned in her review has about 30 seconds with the primatelike creature in question in view, enough to allow a detailed biomechanical analysis by several primate specialists. For one of the most recent, see Jeff Meldrum’s book “Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science.” Meldrum is an associate professor of anatomy and anthropology at Idaho State University, with several peer-reviewed publications on this subject. He takes Bigfoot seriously as a possible unrecognized primate. So do several other scientists, like the well-known primatologists Jane Goodall, George Schaller and John Napier.

580,"Paranormal America: Ghost Encounters, UFO Sightings, Bigfoot Hunts, and Other Curiosities in Religion and Culture (Second Edition) (New York University Press, 2017) is a beautifully written and crafted investigation of the question “who believes in and experiences the paranormal” in America (Bader, Baker, and Mencken, 2017: 13). Christopher D. Baker, Joseph O. Baker, and F. Carson Mencken demonstrate that aspects of paranormal belief are common and widespread throughout America. They investigate the “paranormal” in a variety of forms—including beliefs in psychic phenomena, the existence of Sasquatch or “Bigfoot,” hauntings, and encounters with UFOs—in order to ascertain what Americans are experiencing and/or believing regarding the paranormal. Deploying a synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data, they offer a rich and complex vision of the paranormal in America. Survey data from six thousand Americans through three iterations of the Baylor Religion Survey (from 2005, 2010, and 2014) and two (2014 and 2015) of the Chapman University Survey of American Fears are coupled with field work at psychic fairs, a haunted house, and a Washington state wilderness hike seeking Bigfoot contribute to this multifaceted milieu of the paranormal. This blended methodological approach provides an engaging overview of how Americans encounter, engage, and scrutinize the paranormal. The triangulation of methodologies reveals some of the strengths and limitations of deploying established sociological variables in investigating the paranormal.

The authors contend that the paranormal is itself a complex and contentious subject that resists simple categorizations. These difficulties partly stem from the lack of orthodox definitions regarding what constitutes the “paranormal.” They suggest that the paranormal falls into a sociological negative space outside of institutional science (that typically ignores or dismisses such claims) and organized religion. They also recognize that some religious practices and beliefs—such as the existence of devils, demons, and prophetic dreams—bear striking similarities to the paranormal. In negotiating these difficulties, the authors rely on “a bounded affinity theory of the paranormal that incorporates both the similarities between religious and paranormal beliefs and experiences, along with the cultural distinctions drawn by these organized groups” (Bader, Baker and Mencken, 2017: 30). Organized religion has a curvilinear relationship with the paranormal, with both the non‐religious and very religious the least likely to report either belief in, and experience of, the paranormal. The moderately conventionally religious have the most reported knowledge of and experience with the paranormal.

Gender plays a significant role in predicting interests and interactions with different manifestations of the paranormal. Women gravitate toward aspects of the paranormal that relate to achieving enlightenment : “to become better people either by learning something about the future, understanding the past, or perhaps by gaining supernatural insight into the present” (Bader, Baker and Mencken, 2017: 13). These seekers therefore tend toward psychics, fortune tellers, and others who might offer something that is subjectively beneficial in its outcome (and generally lacking discernible external evidence). Conversely, men pursue the paranormal in the vein of discovery in which “they hope to find compelling evidence for the existence of a phenomena not currently recognized by institutional science” (Bader, Baker and Mencken, 2017: 14). Men tend to be more concerned with documentable phenomena like ghosts, UFOs, and Bigfoot, which might be documented and displayed to skeptics.

One of the more complex variables considered within Paranormal America is class. The authors state that “…there is a significant decrease in the odds of claiming a variety of intensive, sensory religious experiences for each increase on a scale of income, even after controlling for sociodemographic, religious tradition, frequency of religious service attendance, frequency of prayer, and biblical literalism” (Bader, Baker and Mencken, 2017: 57). Rising income eclipses the paranormal, as does higher education: “here it is clear that obtaining a college degree has a dampening effect on paranormal belief” (Bader, Baker and Mencken, 2017: 61). Despite evidence that might be marshaled to support a quasi‐Marxian analysis that the paranormal is a refuge for the economically marginalized, the reality is more complex. After all, psychic fairs, Sasquatch Summits, and haunted house tours are all admission or fee driven, suggesting that much of the paranormal has found a very sustainable niche within consumer culture. However, here also the paranormal easily defies categorization in that the paranormal is not “primarily a creative outlet for the privileged few” and measures of the paranormal like reading horoscopes and having UFO sightings are equally distributed across levels of education and income (Bader, Baker and Mencken, 2017: 78). Instead, the authors turn to Hirschi's theory of delinquency suggesting that attachments, involvements, and commitments to more conventional aspects of society effectively exclude paranormal beliefs and experiences: “The relationship between stakes in conformity and paranormal beliefs is clear. As stakes in conformity increase, paranormal beliefs and experiences steadily and markedly decrease” (Bader, Baker and Mencken, 2017: 189). Despite these findings, the authors posit that the aforementioned sociological variables (and others) are limited in their predicative prowess: “Simply put – paranormal experiences are difficult to predict from status demographics” (Bader, Baker and Mencken, 2017: 234).

These difficulties are compounded by the potential scale and variation of the paranormal. While expressions of belief about some aspect(s) of the paranormal are presently shared by more than half of Americans, these beliefs cover a myriad spectrum. Bader, Baker, and Mencken contend that most people with professed interest in the paranormal are particularists “who believe strongly in one aspect of the paranormal or have had a single type paranormal experience” and not generalists “who hold multiple different types of paranormal beliefs and may claim multiple different types of paranormal experiences” (Bader, Baker and Mencken, 2017: 164). Particularists have no apparent reservations about discriminating between forms of paranormal: for instance, believing in Bigfoot or the reality of haunted locations, and disbelieving others. Particularlists are more likely to be embedded in conventional institutions and lifestyles, which partly explain how they are economically capable of pursuing such interests through travel and purchasing services. Generalists tend to be less attached to conventional lifestyles, making their beliefs part of more unconventional lives.

One of the great contributions of Paranormal America in 2017 is the reiteration that paranormal beliefs are not harbingers of more ominous intentions or inclinations. Generalists “… are not dangerous or mentally ill, they simply live in a different cultural universe than the rest of us” (Bader, Baker and Mencken, 2017: 191). At a time when legitimate fears exist that unusual political, social, and/or religious beliefs might spur violence, Paranormal America is a valuable corrective to such overgeneralizations. The spirited ride of Paranormal America concludes with a discussion focused on demographic trends and how those trends will likely perpetuate paranormal interests in the future. While grounded, this conclusion is a bit disappointing. What makes Paranormal America so compelling is its seamless movement through survey data and engaging, rich, and sympathetic accounts of the individual authors attending Sasquatch conferences, seeking Bigfoot in Washington state forests, a haunted house, and conversations with professed UFO abductees. These narratives are initially placed alongside of the myriad of popular cultural manifestations of the paranormal on films, television, and easily accessible written material in mainstream bookstores and online. Despite these important examples earlier in the book, the potential role(s) of the availability of popular cultural representations of the paranormal encouraging and/or sustaining paranormal beliefs do not feature in the conclusion. This is an unfortunate oversight for an otherwise insightful, thoughtfully written and compelling book. Popular culture plays an important role in spreading and sustaining these paranormal interests and beliefs. Like the truth in the X‐Files , these beliefs are “out there,” and we will be seeing them again.",mainstream
1224,"If you’ve read previous articles on this site, you probably noticed that the word “agenda” is used often. Very often. That is because this site analyzes mass media. And pushing agendas is (and always has been) the primary function of mass media (read the article How Mass Media Shapes and Molds Society for more information).

The word “underlying” is crucial as it refers to the fact that agendas often lay “below the surface” of popular culture. Agendas hide behind news headlines, all forms of entertainment and the words of powerful and influential people. And, since its inception, The Vigilant Citizen website has been about rooting out the underlying agenda in popular culture. It is about highlighting the artificial emphasis placed on specific issues to make them seem more important and relevant than they truly are. In Communication sciences, this concept is called “agenda-setting”.

While the concept of agenda-setting was identified decades ago, it is all the more obvious today. Since all major media outlets are now owned by a handful of mega-corporations, a specific message can easily and quickly saturate the entire world.

In 2019, the agenda-setting was blatantly obvious. In fact, there’s a clear constellation of agendas being simultaneously promoted, all emerging from elite think tanks and expertly calculated to generate a specific response. Here are some of them.

In my article about the Netflix series Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, I highlighted the main message of the series: Witchcraft is a potent tool to fight men and the entire patriarchy.

The first season ended with Sabrina handing over her soul to Satan himself to become a super-witch. And this is presented as a feminist power-move. Sabrina was told:

The article on Chilling Adventures of Sabrina was written nearly exactly one year ago. Since then, the witchcraft agenda literally took flight. But not on a broom.

In the movie K-12 by the pop singer Melanie Martinez (which is also marketed to young girls), the same exact concept is promoted: Witchcraft is the best way of fighting back against boys and the patriarchy.

While entertainment strives to make witchcraft appealing to young girls, “news articles” attempt to make it sound reasonable to older people. Here are some of the headlines that popped up this year.

The conclusion of the article is basically a call to action to aspiring witches.

The article explains how casting spells is better than prayer.

The following headline just straight up says it:

The link between feminism and witchcraft is also heavily promoted by powerful organizations, backed by powerful people.

The feminist organization Women’s March posted this image on November 5th that says “Casting spells Casting Votes”.On the popular site Reddit, a subreddit called WitchesVsPatriarchy has gained quite a following. Here’s one of the top posts ever.

This is one of the top comments:

While mass media is hard at work associating witchcraft with feminism and empowerment, it also does a great job ignoring what it is truly about: The invocation of supernatural powers to control people or events in practices typically involving sorcery or magic. And, despite what they’re trying to tell you, witchcraft is (and has always been) mainly about black magic. And any true occultist will tell you that dabbling in black magic without fully understanding what it is truly about is the dumbest and most dangerous thing one can do.

In Dogmes et Rituels de la Haute Magie (a book that is a must-read for anyone aspiring to practice witchcraft), Eliphas Levi writes:

In short, under the guise of “empowerment”, mass media is selling the exact opposite: Submitting one’s soul to dark forces.

A couple of months ago, I published the article The Elite Machine Behind Greta Thunberg which explained the powerful agents behind her rise to world prominence. Through her famous and very connected parents, this 16-year-old autistic girl got the support of powerful organizations that are backed by extremely wealthy people. A few weeks after this article was published, the agenda was confirmed:

After a year of protests and touring the world, one can ask: What was truly accomplished by Greta and the machine behind her? No concrete actions were taken to crack down on the world’s biggest polluters which are transportation, industry and electric power – all owned by major corporations.

The fact is: The Greta agenda is not about action, it is about emotions. It is about instilling fear, panic and even hopelessness to the youth. Here’s a recent headline that sums up the true effect of the Greta agenda on the world.

This article explains how a group of 2nd graders was shown one of Greta’s speeches, alongside a clock ticking down to their imminent death. This is nothing less than psychological torment meant to scar minds that are too young to deal with this kind of distress.

This campaign of fear and panic orchestrated by mass media is so effective that it is actually causing mental health issues in pre-teens, teens and adults.

The underlying agenda behind Greta is not the environment: It is creating a generation of anxious and depressed people that are easily manipulated through fear-mongering. Who profits from this? Those who control mass media. The elite.

At first “OK boomer” was a meme that made fun of baby boomers (the generation born between 1946 and 1964) who are out-of-touch with young people. Then, as it is often the case with memes with “agenda potential”, OK boomer got “weaponized”. It became political and it was used to dismiss opinions that did not fit the agenda.

The younger generation is being taught that the planet will die in a few years, that there are more than two genders and a bunch of very debatable notions. Despite waves of propaganda, most older people are not buying any of this. Indeed, the “woke” agenda has a very low success rate in people who’ve lived a little.

The answer? OK boomer. The plan? To create a wide gap between young people and their elders. Instead of relying on their elders for adivce, guidance, and perspective that can only come from experience, young people are taught to hate, dismiss and resent them.

OK boomer is a shortcut. It is dismissive. Instead of rationally debating an issue, one can say OK boomer which actually means “shut up old person”.

Even more insidious: OK boomer implies that all young people should think alike. I personally saw this comment pop up on The Vigilant Citizen several times in the past months … even though I am technically a millennial.

The meme gained notoriety when it was used by a New Zeland politician (parliament member for the Green Party of Aotearoa Chlöe Swarbrick) to retort to a heckling politician.

A 25-year-old New Zealand lawmaker giving a speech supporting a climate crisis bill was heckled by an older member of Parliament. Her witty response baffled her audience, to the delight of millennials everywhere. Chlöe Swarbrick was speaking about the Zero Carbon Bill, which would set a target of zero carbon emissions for the country by 2050. When she was heckled, she casually dropped a sharp-tongued retort — “OK boomer” — and, unfazed, continued talking amid the puzzlement and silence of the room. The term, a viral meme among millennials and Generation Z, exploded this year on the TikTok social media app, where countless mocking videos are calling out what young people perceive as out-of-touch Baby Boomers and their patronizing opinions. An article on the New York Times calls the “OK boomer” phenomenon “a rallying cry for millions of fed up kids. T-shirts and hoodies with the phrase have appeared on online marketing sites. Like all memes, OK boomer quickly daded out and became somewhat embarrassing. However, its spirit lives on. After sewing hate between sexes, religions and political affiliations, mass media has promoted division between generations. To those who actually say OK boomer, please ponder this: Is it truly reasonable to hate someone because they are older than you? Don’t you know that you are steadily marching towards that old age as well? Can’t you see that you are, ironically, being manipulated by powerful people who happen to be boomers?

This article explored some of the top agendas that permeated mass media in 2019. Although they address different issues, they have lots of points in common. First, they were all artificially amplified by mass media to create a “buzz”. Second, they’re all perfectly in line with the elite’s agenda based on fear, hatred, and division. Whether it be about equating satanism with empowerment, panicking over imminent death, or hating and dismissing elders, these agendas are all part of a mass media curriculum that is raising a younger generation according to specific values.

And, these values are not good. Although all of these agendas boast a shiny, virtuous surface, the underlying agenda is everything but. It is toxic.

At the risk of being “OK boomer’d” … here’s my advice: Think for yourself and, more importantly, hate is never the answer.

168,"The FTI Niederösterreich proposes the development of a strategy specially for manufacturing technology and automation engineering. Its objective is to establish Lower Austria as one of the leading regions for manufacturing technology and automation engineering. Some specific areas are concerned, such as the additive manufacturing and high-performance machining which can be attractive to outside investors in order to develop further the economy in the region.

 Furthermore, several Lower Austrian industries may be regarded as relevant for advanced manufacturing:

 - The Technopol Wiener Neustadt, including the FOTEC 3D-print centre. The local University of Applied Sciences offers several technical curricula and as early as 1988 has set up the FOTEC technology transfer organisation which today has three business units: engineering technologies, innovative software systems and aerospace engineering. Within the business unit engineering technologies one important competence is in 3D-printing. In 2017, the FOTEC 3D-print centre received an additional € 2,1m to invest in 3D-printing equipment for metal products. Other relevant research institutions and firms in Wiener Neustadt focus on surfaces and new materials or specific applications which are relevant for advanced manufacturing.

 - The Mechatronics Cluster that brings together companies from the mechanical engineering, plant building and other related sectors such as equipment and apparatus construction, technology and component sub-supply, R&D, education and training. It stretches over several federal states with a focus on Upper Austria. Altogether, there are 337 cluster partners which are mainly active as service suppliers, followed by mechanical engineering firms and technology/component suppliers.

 - The Plastics Cluster that also stretches all over Austria with most members stemming from Upper Austria. In total, there are 409 members. With a view to their competencies, they are mainly active in plastics processing; machinery, tools and moulds as well as services.

 - The Green Building Cluster. Its members represent the whole value chain around construction and renovation including building materials, building systems, construction, energy technology, planning and consulting as well as related R&D efforts. In Lower Austria alone, the cluster has 235 members.

 - The E-mobility initiative of Lower Austria, which was launched in 2010. The initiative is ruled by the Electromobility Strategy 2014-2020 and has developed projects such as the E-Mob Train, the Top e-car dealership, the E-fast charging, and several charging stations for e-bikes all over Lower Austria. Its main goal is to be a catalyst for new mobility behaviour and to strengthen economic power.

 The relevance of advanced manufacturing for Lower Austria is acknowledged by the federal government. Within the framework of the national FTI-Strategy further steps for promoting advanced production are envisioned that may later develop an impact in Lower Austria.

 In Austria, public-private partnerships between the government and social organisations play an important role for policy design and implementation. Hence, several stakeholders are involved in most policy making activities. Apart from the activities by the federal state and the promotion agencies the chambers of commerce and the Federation of Austrian Industries play an important role in the local promotion of advanced manufacturing.

 With a view to RIS3, the promotion of advanced manufacturing is highly relevant for the implementation of Lower Austria's innovation strategy. The Federation of Austrian Industries and the chambers have been represented in many committees and steering groups during public consultation. This included lobbying for specific fields like production and automatisation technology, surface and material technology, but also renewables, medical technology, biotechnology and food safety. Related activities promoted through the federation and the chambers are information events in which information on topics like ""Industry 4.0"" or ""material and resource efficiency"" are provided.

 Research institutions and firms from Lower Austria have been engaged in various networks and other initiatives at the international and the European level. As an illustration, the project Smart Frame had the engagement of the Technopol Wiener Neustadt as lead partner. Smart Frame was a network aiming at promoting a network by connecting partners from a number of European countries. Since October 2017, Lower Austria is a member of the Vanguard Initiative which aims to create growth by strengthening smart specialisation strategies.",mainstream
133,"Since New York City has become the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the US, it has drawn a lot of attention. But it seems that the media and health officials may not be the only ones with their eyes on the Big Apple.

Coinciding with the skyrocketing number of cases of coronavirus in NYC, there has also been an increase in UFO sightings in the skies over Manhattan.

Most recently a Manhattan woman claimed to have spotted a strange UFO hovering over the area. According to the eyewitness, the mysterious object followed her as she was taking her dog for a walk.

The woman, who did not reveal her identity, reported her encounter via the UFO Sightings Daily blog. According to her, she took her dog out for a walk at around 8 o’clock p.m. on the evening of April 21, near the upper west side of New York City.

As she and her dog were walking down the street, she noticed a bright light in the sky. At first, she thought it was an airplane. However, after walking about half a block, she spotted the same bright object in the sky again.

According to the woman, the object did not appear to be moving in a specific direction. Instead, it seemed it was following her as she continued to take her dog for a walk. “I did half [a] block with my dog [and] I stopped again and noticed this light [moved into] position, but [it] was not going in a clear direction,” the woman stated according to UFO Sightings Daily. “When I [started] walking, I noticed this light [was] also moving. When I stopped, the light stopped parallel to me.”

The eyewitness noted that she observed the strange light by walking outside to see if it would still follow her. She said that wherever she went, the object moved in the same direction. The woman said she spent almost an hour walking outside her apartment to observe the strange light’s movements.

Although the video she took is not clear enough to help identify the strange object, it is possible that it was a drone being controlled by someone in the area. It is possible that the person controlling the drone was deliberately following the woman through a mounted camera as a form of a prank, or its movements were purely coincidental.

Various news outlets including CNN and The Hill have reported that drones are sometimes being used in the city to monitor the current lockdown status. Others however, speculate that it is not terrestrial authorities that are monitoring the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, but aliens, who themselves are responsible for the release of the virus, as some kind of precursor to invasion.

Interestingly enough, the increase in UFO sightings in the skies over New York City comes on the heels of the Pentagon recently confirming that three formerly classified videos taken by Navy pilots were officially interactions with “unidentified aerial phenomena.”

1246,"Title: Immunisation and how it works

[Voiceover] Immunisation is a simple and effective way to help protect children (and adults) against serious diseases.

By immunising your child, you give them the best start to a healthy future, and you protect your community by reducing the spread of disease.

[Slide showing chapters of the video - Immunisation and how it works, How your immunse system works, How immunisation works, Community immunity, Why it's important to immunise on time, every time, Vaccine safety]

Every day your body comes across many different types of germs.

Some of these can make you very sick.

[Animation show a child fighting off germs with their immune system]

Your body has a natural defence system, called the immune system, which helps fight off germs that can cause serious disease.

One of the ways your body fights off germs is by making special antibodies that know what a particular germ looks like, and can find and destroy it.

The first time your body meets a new germ, it can take some time for your body to make these antibodies.

Until those germs are destroyed, you might get sick.

But later on, if you come across the same germ again, your body can remember it and fight it off before you get sick.

This is why once you’ve had a disease, you usually don’t catch it again because your body fights off the germ before you can get sick.

Immunisation protects against diseases in the same way.

It gives your immune system a practice run with a broken-up or weakened germ so it won’t give you the disease.

Your body learns how to recognise those germs and is ready to fight them off before they can make you sick.

You may get a fever or a headache after you are given a vaccine.

This is a common response to the vaccine and should pass quickly.

If you’re worried at any time, talk with your doctor or nurse.

[Animation showing what happens once you've been immmunised and you come across the germs again]

Once you’ve been immunised, If you come across the same germ again, your body will remember it and fight off the germ before you get sick.

This is how immunisation protects against disease.

There’s another way that immunisation can help protect our whanau, and that’s by making sure that we don’t even come into contact with preventable diseases in the first place.

[Animation showing the differences between when only a few people are immunised disease is more likely to spread.]

[Voiceover] When only a few people are immunised, diseases can spread very quickly.

[Animation showing when a large amount of people in the community are immunised, the disease is less likely to spread]

When more people are immunised, diseases can’t spread as quickly – but are still able to spread.

But when most people are immunised, disease can’t spread through our community and so most people stay well.

There are always a few people in every community who are either too young to be immunised or have a weakened immune system, such as cancer patients.

These people can get very sick when they catch a disease, so it’s really important that everyone around them is immunised.

So, if enough people are immunised, the community as a whole can be protected.

In New Zealand, measles outbreaks among teenagers and young adults are still common because many of them were not immunised as young children.

[Shots of various media stories reporting on the spread of whooping cough and measles]

[Voiceover] Diseases like whooping cough or measles can spread quickly.

If most of the people in a community are not immunised, these diseases can spread rapidly and lead to an outbreak.

Community immunity can help to prevent this risk.

When we choose to immunise, we not only protect ourselves, we protect our whanau, and our whole community.

[Slide - Why it's important to immunise on time, every time]

The National Immunisation Schedule sets out the best time to get immunised so that your child can be protected when they need it most.

For example, women need more protection against influenza while they are pregnant.

Babies need to be protected as young as possible against whooping cough and other serious diseases.

In New Zealand, baby’s first immunisations are due at 6 weeks, 3 months and 5 months.

Some vaccines are recommended at a slightly older age.

[Slide showing a 15 month old, 4 year old and 11 and 12 year old children]

At age 15 months, young children get immunised against measles and chickenpox, as well as boosters for some of their earlier vaccines.

[Slide showing all age groups of the diseases they need to be immunised for]

Boosters are important as they remind your immune system’s memory to keep protecting against harmful germs.

It’s important to immunise on time. Delaying immunisation can put your child at greater risk of catching a serious disease.

All vaccines used in New Zealand have been thoroughly tested to make sure they are safe and that they work well before they are approved, a process that can take many years.

Safety monitoring continues even after the vaccines are approved and being used by millions of people around the world.

That’s how we know the benefits of immunisation far outweigh any potential risk, and why immunisation is recommended by the Ministry of Health and health professionals.",mainstream

332,"Bigfoot exists and there is DNA to prove it, or at least that’s what one scientific journal is claiming.

Bigfoot exists and there is DNA to prove it, or at least that’s what one scientific journal is claiming, according to the Huffington Post U.K.

The study, published in the DeNovo Scientific Journal is a culmination of lead researcher Melba Ketchum’s five years studyingalleged samples of the Sasquatch’s hair, blood, saliva and urine.

However, the legitimacy of the scientific journal that published the Sasquatch Genome Project is being questioned: Ketchum, a Texas researcher and former veterinarian, purchased the publication after her study, titled “Novel North American Hominins: Next Generation Sequencing of Three Whole Genomes and Associated Studies,” had been rejected by other journals.

“Rather than spend another five years just trying to find a journal to publish and hoping that decent, open minded reviewers would be chosen, we acquired the rights to this journal and renamed it so we would not lose the passing peer reviews that are expected by the public and the scientific community,” wrote Ketchum on the project’s website.

The DeNovo Scientific Journal has no other studies, articles, papers or reviews, and only Ketchum’s paper has been “published” by the journal, NBC News pointed out. It also is not subscribed to by any major library or university, and its website apparently didn’t exist until three weeks ago. In the words of LiveScience’s Benjamin Radford, “It is not an existing, known or respected journal in any sense of the word.”

This isn’t the first time Ketchum’s Bigfoot DNA evidence has been met with criticism. In November she released a statement about her Bigfoot findings, calling Bigfoot “a human hybrid” that had emerged 15,000 years ago through the mating of a human female and some other speciesunknown to science. She has called on governments to recognize the Sasquatch as “an indigenous people and immediately protect their human and Constitutional rights.”

At that time, the Bigfoot study had not been peer-reviewed — and according to NBC News, while the study has now been published, it still hasn’t been assessed by reputable scientists.

Ketchum’s Sasquatch Genome Project team has released a 19-second video, which reportedly shows a sleeping Bigfoot in Kentucky in 2005. Although as the Huffington Post noted, the video only raises further questions.",mainstream

You should go back to the GP if you do not start to feel better 2 to 3 days after starting antibiotics.

It's important to keep taking antibiotics until they're finished, even when you feel better.

Most people make a full recovery after 7 to 10 days.

If your cellulitis is severe, your GP might refer you to hospital for treatment.",mainstream

Bill Gates on Finding a Vaccine for COVID-19, the Economy, and Returning to ‘Normal Life’

Looks like Scott Adams is a puppet of Big Brother!

Vaccines For Bill Gates Are A Strategic Philanthropy That Gives Him Dictatorial Control Over Global Health Policy

Definitive word on the founding detail for RCA, NBC, CBC.

This is an FCC report from 1941 (judicially recognizable)

We are living at a time, in which humanity must prepare gradually to transcend mere philosophical idealism, and pass on to a true consciousness of the spiritual worlds, of the general spiritual world in which we live just as we live in the physical world.

Is it true that America and Europe have been SOLD by political leaders to new landowners?

Is it true that the virus was used to clear out buildings and to remove people from the streets and from their jobs to wreck the economy so that citizens would have no way of defending themselves from the new landowners?

Do you have any knowledge or sense that America and Europe have been SOLD out from under our feet?

Are Americans and Europeans told to stay home because they can be arrested for trespass wherever they step a foot?

Are we required to wear masks because it is considered theft to breathe the air now owned by…the invisible enemy…landowners?

If there is anyone in the world who has the intuition to see beyond the facade, you and Thomas can.

If it is true that political leaders SOLD our country to new landowners, we are in really deep doo doo.

It might explain why the media, judges, governors, senators, and congressman have been acting so strangely towards Trump.

How could Trump possibly stand up to such betrayal of the American people, especially when the America people are hogtied and muzzled?

Our reply: We spent several years doing the research, and give you the hard EVIDENCE and documentation that shows you that this madness comes from that batshit queen in England.

Want to know the origins of the coup?

Want to know who is really behind fake news propaganda?

Want to know who released the coronavirus into China?

Total system failure will give rise to new economy

Now back to that other British operation: The Overthrow of Donald J. Trump. These facts are pesky things that aren’t going away, folks. The Brits will not be able to hide their WAR against America for much longer. Citizen journalists are walking the truth right back to the Queen and her ass-wiping Privy Council. Little footnotes and such will not keep them safe.

The challenge for Swamp Rat Billy, protecting his pals in the SES, “is not investigating what we don’t know, but rather navigating through what ‘We The People’ are already aware of…. And then finding a way to protect the institutions of the DOJ and FBI while getting people to stop demanding action to address the corruption within them.”

And what are We The People aware of? That the British Crown is ground zero for the overthrow attempt of Donald Trump and it is the Queen’s companies QinetiQ and Pirbright that created and released the bioweapon. Swamp Rat Billy will have a difficult time keeping the Queen and Privy Council protected from TRUTH.

Not so fast, on this same interview, before Fauci said this, he also said:

“We make a recommendation. often the recommendation is taken. sometimes it’s not. but it is what it is: we are where we are right now.”

The above is a great sound bite for the fake news to quote verbatim and claim that, according to Dr. Fauci, we only “are where we are right now” because Trump did NOT take the experts recommendations.

There is more too. That one was at CNN, but Fauci also did more damage talking to Al Sharpton on MSNBC.

He claims that in mid January, he was advising the administration that COVID-19 could be a “major problem” for the U.S., despite the fact that he wasn’t even a fan of blocking travel from China on Jan 31st, when Trump did it regardless of not having much support for the decision even from his own camp.

This is the beginning of the video, uploaded by the Trump War Room channel, because Fauci says that the U.S. got “misinformation” from China on coronavirus, but they cut the video when Sharpton asks WHEN it was clear that the situation was worse than China was saying: https://youtu.be/timKpZM9G5o

This is the continuation of the video, which was the only part that MSNBC uploaded to its channel, since it’s what sounds damaging to Trump because Fauci is not being honest and is saying that, in mid January, he warned Trump and the administration that the virus was a “major problem,” which contradicts everything he publicly said at the time and later, including, for example, saying in late January, that the virus was of very low risk for the American people, and telling “healthy” people, on Mar 9th, that they could go on cruises: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgLLEfO8ZO8

Here is what Fauci was saying on Jan 26 (certainly after “mid January”):

 “Government health agency official: Coronavirus ‘isn’t something the American public need to worry about” http://archive.vn/4nSpr

Here is a report of Fauci encouraging “healthy” people to go on cruises on March 9th, which was a contradiction to the State Department’s advice a day earlier, but Trump was still following Fauci’s recommendations. It was 4 days later that Trump negotiated with major US cruise lines to voluntarily suspend outbound cruises immediately: “Contradictions and questionable advice: How officials handled South Florida’s coronavirus crisis” http://archive.vn/mK0mw#selection-2617.0-2672.1

AIM Patriot Douglas R. writes: In 1975 I was in Senegal, Africa. Whilst on an incursion into the interior we passed a USA bioweapon laboratory. It had a sign saying so. Didn’t think much of till we got back to the USA and soon AIDS broke out. At the time the news claimed a green monkey got away from a bio lab in Senegal……

This was way before the bioweapon treaty in 1989, so it seemed odd we would use a beard institute in the depths of Africa? So, see if I got this: The British with funding from Gates made up the bioweapon in the UK at Pirbright. Then the Queen’s men furnish the weapon to Wuhan, China along with 3.7 million dollar grant to make it better? Then the Chinese send it over here to cause chaos and mayhem?

Now the Queen has paid the media NOT to be mentioned, even with the US patent 10,130,701, and the Chinese and USA will blame each other until it goes to a new news cycle and is forgotten like so may Arkansides? When do we get to break out the pitchforks and torches?(six feet apart, of course!)

NO FOOD FOR YOU!

Ahhhhh now it makes sense why Bozo Bezos and Amazon bought a grocery store chain….just in time for coronavirus",conspiracy
1090,"Jeff Bezos is now the richest person on earth, with his personal fortune eclipsing the wealth amassed by legendary investor Warren Buffet and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates. Bezos made the top spot of Forbes magazine's 2018 400 Richest in America list with a net worth of $160 billion. Jeff Bezos has literally dozens of ideas that span a broad range of investments, all the way from real estate to the retrieval of rocket ship engines from the ocean floor.

The founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of global e-commerce behemoth Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) is responsible for running a platform that accounted for 4% of all U.S. retail sales in 2017 and a whopping 44% of digital spending. As digitalization reshapes human behavior and the cloud computing revolution does the same to enterprise, the leader in online retail, with its high-flying cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) is only forecasted to propel higher — spelling more good news for its CEO.

When Bezos had his idea for ""the everything store,"" his well-intentioned friends and family tried to talk him out of quitting his ""stable job"" in finance. Yet Bezos, raised by his teen mom and later his Cuban immigrant stepfather, always dreamed of creating something different, once telling his school teacher that ""the future of mankind is not on this planet."" Bezos even has a website, BezosExpeditions.com, that provides a rundown of 20 or so of his major investments and charitable donations. The name ""expeditions"" is appropriate since Bezos' investments are not concentrated in just one or two industries or even market sectors; rather, they represent a far-flung exploration of many different business areas and ideas, including media, virtual reality, cloud computing, and homespun arts and crafts.

The tech visionary graduated from Princeton with a major in computer science and electrical engineering. Upon graduating, he turned down job offers from companies such as Intel and Bell Labs to join a startup called Fitel. He went on to launch a news-by-fax service company with Halsey Minor, the founder of CNET. After the venture failed, Bezos became the youngest senior vice president at a hedge fund called D.E. Shaw, working his way up the ranks in just four years.

Bezos could have stayed on Wall Street for the rest of his career if he hadn't been enthralled by the knowledge that by 1994, the internet was growing at the rate of 2,300% annually. Soon enough, his idea for Amazon was born, and the CEO began making a list of 20 possible product categories to sell online.

Amazon.com, then a platform for selling books, grew in its early stages out of a garage with a pot-belly stove. Bezos, who put his own $10,000 in the company comprised of himself, his wife and two programmers, ironically conducted most of his meetings at the neighborhood Barnes & Noble. Within its first month after launch in July 1995, Amazon sold books in every state in the U.S. and 45 countries around the world.

During Amazon's first year, Bezos tried to raise money by predicting $74 million in sales by 2000, far underestimating the reality: $1.64 billion. He managed to gather $1 million in seed funding from angel investors after using up investment from his family, primarily from his parents, who chipped into a significant portion of their life savings. According to the CEO, the first 20 or so outside investors in Amazon put in about $50,000 each for a stake of less than 1%. Each investment would now be worth around $6 billion, representing a 120,000 times return, given the investors held onto their entire stakes and that they had never been diluted by later investors. In June 1996, Amazon raised another $8 million in Series A from venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins.

Amazon went public in May 1997 and turned out to be one of the few startups that survived the dot-com bust. As the platform diversified its product offerings and solidified itself as a market leader and pioneer, annual sales skyrocketed from $510,000 in 1995 to over $17 billion in 2001. In 2013, Bezos revealed his first plans for the company's revolutionary Amazon Prime subscription business, with Amazon Prime Air, which would use drones to deliver to customers.

In 1998, Bezos also became an early investor in Google. While he has not revealed what he has kept of the stock after its initial public offering in 2004, his $250,000 investment would be worth well over $6 billion today. In August 2013, the business mogul bought The Washington Post for $250 million. Since then, its audience and traffic has exploded, surpassing The New York Times in terms of U.S. unique web viewers in October 2015.

The company's share price reflects this phenomenal growth. The stock has given an over 523% return over the past 5 years and is up 67.7% year-to-date as of October 3, 2018. Bezos owns about 16.3% of the 24-year-old company, making it the biggest source of his wealth. A Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing in November 2017 showed that the CEO sold 1 million shares of his company for $1.1 billion. The last filing, dated August 2018, shows Bezos owning 78.8 million shares.

Bezos also has substantial holdings in more traditional investments such as real estate. His 165,000-acre Corn Ranch in Texas was acquired as the base of operations for his aerospace company, Blue Origin, and serves as the test site for the vertical-landing manned suborbital New Shepard rocket.

His personal real estate includes holdings on both the east and west coast. Bezos has two multi-million dollar homes in Beverly Hills and a 10,000-square-foot apartment in the Century Tower in Manhattan that cost him just under $10 million. Bezos' New York presence is reported to have boosted Century Tower property values even higher, with space selling for $2,000 to $3,000 per square foot. He also has a lakeside property in Washington State, on which he spent $28 million to increase the living space to almost 30,000 square feet.

In 2012, Amazon bought its own South Lake Union headquarters building in Seattle for $1.5 billion, instantly making the company one of the city's largest commercial property owners. Amazon took possession of nearly a dozen buildings, almost 2 million square feet of office space and approximately 100,000 square feet of retail space. Also in 2012, the company spent about $200 million to purchase a three-block area in downtown Seattle that is being developed as office tower space. In 2014, Amazon spent another $50 million to pick up one more square block. In August 2017, the Seattle Times reported that Amazon had just as much office space as Seattle's next 40 largest employers combined.

Bezos has also invested very sizable sums in giving back through charitable donations. In addition to the Bezos Family Foundation that funds several education projects, Bezos has made individual multimillion-dollar charitable contributions to the Seattle Museum of History and Industry, as well as to his alma mater, Princeton University.

In January 2018, Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, announced a $33 million dollar donation to TheDream.US, an organization working to improve college access for undocumented immigrant youth who were brought to the United States as young children. The grant will provide college scholarships to 1,000 US high school graduates with DACA status.

Bezos has an affinity for the technology sector, for media and communication services that facilitate connecting people, and also for just what he considers to be potentially profitable investments. In the media and communications sector, Bezos has invested in Twitter, Inc. and has committed nearly $50 million in venture capital to the popular business news website Business Insider. He acquired The Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million. TeachStreet, Inc., ZocDoc, Inc., and Nextdoor are all platforms for connecting people in which Bezos has invested. Bezos Expeditions has also invested in UNITY Biotechnology, Inc., a healthcare startup targeting diseases related to aging.

In the travel sector, Bezos has invested $112 million and $35 million, respectively, in series B financing of Airbnb and transportation service Uber. Bezos is a big believer in the cloud, as evidenced by Amazon's major push into providing cloud computing services. However, his investment interest does not end with his own company. One of his notable investment successes is Workday, Inc., a company that provides human resource services in the cloud. Shortly after Bezos' venture capital investment in the company, it went public in an initial public offering (IPO) that garnered $684 million. In the sphere of a more traditional retail business, Bezos has also invested in Glassybaby, a company that makes glass-blown holders for votive candles.

Two of Bezos' investments that engender a lot of discussion and that are considered a bit off-the-wall are the 10,000-year clock and the F-1 engine retrieval project. The 10,000-year clock project is an effort to build a clock into the side of the Sierra Diablo mountain range in Texas, a clock that literally keeps on ticking for 10,000 years. The clock is planned to have a chime generator that generates a different chime sound for each day. Just coming up with 10,000 x 365 different chime sounds like a pretty daunting challenge. Bezos explained the need for the clock by saying today's global problems require ""long-term thinking.""

The F-1 engine retrieval project is an effort to salvage the engines that powered the Apollo 11 flight to the moon from the ocean floor. Bezos assumes NASA would likely donate the engines to the Smithsonian.

With his booming wealth, Bezos is now able to fulfill his childhood dream of becoming a space entrepreneur. Each year, he commits $1 billion to his space-exploration company, Blue Origin, which, in 2016 became one of the first commercial companies to launch a reusable rocket. on July 18, 2018, Blue Origin sent spacecraft ""New Shepard"" into high altitude order to test its safety systems, which worked.",mainstream
238,"Why do Paul Muldoon's poems regularly include phrases such as these: ‘Mercy was thirteen, maybe fourteen’ (‘Boon’); ‘Internal exiles at thirteen or fourteen’ (‘The Geography Lesson’); ‘I was thirteen or fourteen’ (‘Making the Move’); ‘she was twenty / or twenty-one’ (‘Big Foot’)? The same mannerism appears in his prose: Muldoon writes that he ‘first read Donne […] at the age of fifteen or sixteen’. The youngest age such phrases mention is ‘ten’; the oldest is ‘twenty-one’. These paired ages (I have not listed them all) are only one of the many ways in which Muldoon's work has used his, and our, notions of adolescence. From the adventure-tales and drug-lore of ‘Yarrow’ to the schooltime pranks of ‘Twice’, from the embarrassed chastity of ‘Cuba’ to the lubriciousness of ‘De Secretis Mulierum’, from recurring phrases to recurring characters (such as the schoolmate Will Hunter), many of Muldoon's poems include adolescent protagonists, or feelings and situations we associate with adolescence. These adolescent figures and situations can help us interpret Muldoon's styles, and his concerns.

No critic has looked at Muldoon's use of youth as such. Yet his poetry has long struck readers (both hostile and friendly) as somehow immature. Mark Ford described Meeting the British (admiringly) as ‘outlandish’ and ‘emotionally discontinuous’, comparing Muldoon's provocative personae to Seamus Heaney's ‘absolutely solid poetic personality’. For the American critic Calvin Bedient, Muldoon exhibits a ‘brilliant callowness’; he thus ‘fit[s] […] Ortega y Gasset's characterization of [modernism] as masculine and youthful’. Other critics have described Muldoon's ‘elusiveness’ (Peter McDonald), his ‘deconstructive impulse’ (Edna Longley), his ‘chimerical […] first-person voice’ (William Wilson), and his attraction to the ‘contingent and provisional’ (Steven Matthews). Muldoon's versions of youth and young people explain, and act out, the elusive, provocative stances so often remarked in his work. In her study of novels about adolescence, Patricia Meyer Spacks suggests that to recall youth is to imagine the self as provisional, unfixed: ‘As during those adolescent years,’ she writes, ‘one endlessly re-created oneself, trying out […] different possible roles, so now one re-invents those past selves, converting the shifting shapes of adolescence into images that make retrospective sense.’",mainstream
832,"The president of the European Commission made what should have been a routine appearance at a Brussels think tank event on Thursday. It ended up moving the financial markets and forcing him into an apology (of sorts).

That's typical of Jean-Claude Juncker, a man never afraid to go off piste and deliver a killer soundbite. (The most recent example was him saying on the way into Friday's European Council summit: ""I am not a British prime minister; it would be good for Britain if I was.”)

Here are some of Juncker's best (or maybe that should be worst?) gaffes.

Juncker warned Thursday the EU should be prepared for the “worst” in Italy after the March 4 election. “We have to brace ourselves for the worst scenario and the worst scenario could be no operational government,” he said at an event organized by the Centre for European Policy Studies. He also warned of possible fluctuations on the financial markets after the vote, which most polls predict will end in a hung parliament.

The Commission boss's remarks appeared to have their impact on the markets: The spread between Italian and German 10-year bond yields, a gauge of Italy’s borrowing costs and of market confidence in the Italian economy, widened to 138 points from 134 at the start of the day.

In a statement issued later Thursday, Juncker tried to smooth things over. “Whatever the outcome, I am confident that we will have a government that makes sure that Italy remains a central player in Europe and in shaping its future,” he wrote.

On Friday morning, Juncker said as he entered the summit that while he felt he had been ""totally misunderstood,"" his comments were nevertheless ""misleading.""

Don't call Macedonia ""Macedonia"" is a fairly basic, if seemingly absurd, one for an EU leader. Until Greece and its northern neighbor reach an agreement (yeah, right) it's officially the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Guess who forgot (while standing next to Zoran Zaev, the Macedonian PM)?

“I’m meeting presidents and prime ministers from the Western Balkan countries,"" Juncker said last December. “Even as the prime minister of Luxembourg I was in Macedonia … I mean FYROM.”

He did have the good grace to look appalled at the error.

A double faux pas here (or a Boris, as it's sometimes known) from last July. At a press conference in Brussels with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and Commission Vice President Maroš Šefčovič, the European commissioner from Slovakia, Juncker’s old Nokia phone rang.

Juncker presumed it was his wife calling, and unlike former U.S. Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani, who famously answered the phone when his wife called in the middle of a 2007 campaign speech to the National Rifle Association, Juncker declined the call. He quickly realized it was German Chancellor Angela Merkel, not his wife, whom he had declined to answer.

A contentious one, this, as ""ridiculous"" is a word many have used to describe the European Parliament. It's more unusual to hear it from a Commission president speaking in the Parliament.

In July 2017, Juncker accused the European Parliament of showing a lack of respect for smaller countries after only a tiny number of MEPs showed up for a speech by the Maltese prime minister.

“I salute those that have taken the trouble to be in the room,” a visibly furious Juncker said to the largely empty chamber in Strasbourg. “The European Parliament is ridiculous, very ridiculous,” Juncker added. “The fact that about 30 MEPs are seated in this debate is enough to show that the Parliament is not serious.”

It sparked a multilingual clash with Parliament President Antonio Tajani, who angrily defended the Parliament, saying it controlled the Commission not the other way around, At first, Tajani implored Juncker in Italian: “I beg you to have a respectful behavior.”

Juncker, who slapped the air angrily with his hands as he spoke, was having none of it.

“There are only a few members,” he shot back at Tajani, switching to English from French. “There are only a few members in the plenary to control the Commission. You are ridiculous! I want to pay tribute to the Maltese.”

Being unable to keep track of Romanian PMs

Another contentious one as seemingly most Romanians have now been their country's prime minister.

“[Viorica Dăncilă] is the fifth Romanian prime minister I had the pleasure to host from the beginning of my mandate,” Juncker said on Wednesday during a joint press conference with the newest holder of the top job in Bucharest, who took office last month. “I would like this cycle be stopped and that she stays longer because I start to lose track of all those I’ve seen.”

Dăncilă is the third prime minister from the governing Social Democrats since the party won a parliamentary election in December 2016.

Last November, Juncker traded blows with the Luxembourg government over its reluctance to back an EU tax plan against online giants like Google and Amazon. Juncker told Luxembourg’s Paperjam, “it is a historic mistake to not want to tax at the appropriate levels the profits of multinational companies which act globally and don’t pay the taxes they owe.”

Hang on a minute, is this the same Jean-Claude Juncker who was prime minister of Luxembourg for nigh-on two decades and under whose watch the grand duchy struck sweetheart tax deals with some of the world's biggest firms?

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán isn't everyone's cup of right-wing tea (U.S. Senator John McCain labeled him a ""neo-fascist dictator""). But it was still odd to hear a European leader greet him with the words ""Hello, dictator"" at a summit in Riga in May 2015. While Juncker's greeting was picked up by the cameras, Orbán's response was not — probably for the best.

At the same Riga summit, Juncker's touchy-feely-kissy style was on full display. He accosted a procession of leaders, showering them with kisses, hugs, necktie-grabs and even an insult or two — in a meet-and-greet that may never be equaled in European politics.

In 2016, the European Commission gave France leeway on fiscal rules “because it is France,” Juncker said. In the pre-Macron era, that went down rather badly with Germany and the thriftier members of the eurozone.

The EU's fiscal rules require a budget deficit under 3 percent of GDP. The Commission in 2015 gave France two more years to bring its deficit below that level but it failed to do so. Asked why the Commission had turned a blind eye to French infractions, Juncker told French TV that it did so “because it is France.”

It's OK for politicians to lie

In May 2011, while still holding the reins in Luxembourg, Juncker told a meeting of the federalist European Movement that he often “had to lie” and that eurozone monetary policy should be discussed in “secret, dark debates.”

Having a go at POLITICO

In the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, Juncker was asked to respond to calls for him to quit for failing to persuade the U.K. to stay in the EU. ""You think many believe what it says in POLITICO. That is obviously not the case,"" Juncker said. A year before, he said this newcomer to Brussels practiced ""peep-show journalism.""

Granted, the Commission president probably doesn't recognize either incident as a gaffe. Or he might refer to the journalist Michael Kinsley's definition of one: ""When a politician tells the truth — or more precisely, when he or she accidentally reveals something truthful about what is going on in his or her head.""",mainstream
700,"David Kirkpatrick finds himself in the unenviable position of being grounded for a whole month.

It seems Mom didn`t like it when he and a friend forgot to check with her before they rode their bikes to an ice cream store in Wisconsin.

So the precocious 12-year-old, whose most immediate goal in life is to play football for Harvard Junior High, is spending a big chunk of his summer puttering around his hometown of Big Foot, a community of 28 tidy,

unpretentious homes astride the Illinois-Wisconsin state line about 80 miles northwest of Chicago.

Big Foot is on U.S. Highway 14 two miles south of Walworth, Wis. It takes its name from the English translation of Maunk-suck, a locally known Potawatomi Indian chief.

By big-city standards, there doesn`t seem to be much to do in the town of maybe 75 residents.

The busiest place in town is the abattoir, but the owners don`t like to talk about what they do on the inside-slaughter animals for sausage.

The only grocery closed years ago, and of the six gas stations that once lined the highway, none remains. The post office was torn down and the railroad was torn up.

Like a lot of small country towns, beneath the sleepy rustic facade of Big Foot lurk the same frustrations, hopes, pain and pleasures of the city, but at a greatly reduced pace.

It`s all relative. Big Foot, its residents like to point out, operates at a lot faster pace than does Dynamite Springs, just down the road.

When you talk to someone in Big Foot about the big city, you have to specify which one-Chicago, Milwaukee or Rockford. Big Foot residents also specify from which side of the state line they come. The line means neighbors have different schools, county seats and telephone area codes.

Just south of State Line Road, Andy Nowak, a refugee from Chicago`s Northwest Side, is contemplating a beer garden behind his tavern. What if the neighbors across the street don`t like the idea? ''That`s Wisconsin,'' replied Nowak. ''We`ll just turn the speakers the other way.''

Just north of the road, Bob and Ardis Miller sit on folding chairs behind their fireworks stand, which would be illegal 200 feet south in Illinois. Occasionally they make a sale to passing tourists, but they also spend a lot of time distributing free travel advice.

''We have a map here. With I-90 (the Northwest Tollway) all torn up, everyone wants to know how to get back to Chicago,'' said Ardis Miller, a Big Foot resident most of her life.

A couple of blocks south, in a small office just off his mother`s kitchen from which he runs the family`s long-haul trucking business, Bob Kirkpatrick, 43, also dispenses travel directions. He`s directing a couple of his truck drivers who had erroneously wound up with a load of coolers in Bainbridge, Ohio, instead of Bainbridge Center, Ohio. The two towns are at almost opposite ends of the state.

A third-generation resident, he remembers attending a one-room country school in Big Foot, which is now closed. His son, David, now travels by bus five miles to a school in Harvard.

Peloponnesian-born Lee Archos lives in Harvard and commutes the other way every day to operate the Big Foot Inn.

''When a real estate agent brought me here to look at this place, I asked him why,'' recalled Archos of his first visit to the hamlet 13 years ago after working in restaurants in Chicago, Evanston and Crystal Lake. ''I wondered where the customers were going to come from.''

As it turned out, the restaurant survives on the weekend trade from the Lake Geneva area with a strategy of offering standard American cooking

(steaks, chops, seafood) at lower prices than restaurants of comparable quality in the resort area. Big Foot Inn has done so well, in fact, that Archos remodeled and expanded the place a few years ago.

Hoping to repeat Archos` success, Nowak got rid of his tavern in Chicago and bought the Little Toe in Big Foot last year to support him in semi-retirement. Since then, he has been busy rehabilitating the place and is adding horseshoe pits and a volleyball court to attract upscale customers. The beer garden may come later.

Like Kirkpatrick, Archos and most Big Foot residents, Nowak has grown fond of the unhurried rural lifestyle. ''It`s a slower pace,'' he said.

''Big Foot is a town that hasn`t been urbanized. It`s untouched,'' added Kirkpatrick.",mainstream
75,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune condition that causes chronic inflammation. With RA, your immune system attacks your body’s tissues and causes painful swelling of the joints. Without treatment, RA can severely damage joints. There are many ways that rheumatoid arthritis can appear, but some of the most recognized signs are in the hands and feet. However, many different joints can be affected, with varying severity. Imaging tests, like X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) help doctors take a close look at your joints and assess any damage. RA can also affect other parts of the body, including skin, blood vessels, eyes, and lungs. People with RA may deal with fatigue and general weakness as well.

One of the first noticeable features of RA can be seen in the hands. Swelling of the knuckle joints and wrists leads to severe pain and stiffness, especially in the morning. Chronic inflammation can cause the fingers to twist in an outward direction. This can take a toll on fine motor skills. In advanced cases of RA, the hands can permanently change shape and interfere with quality of life. With proper treatment, RA symptoms can be managed. Treatments focus on reducing the inflammation to prevent joint damage. For hands and fingers, these may include medications, injections, and splinting. Splinting helps support the joints but shouldn’t be worn for too long because it may lead to muscle deterioration. If these treatments don’t work, you may need surgery.

More than 90 percent of people with RA develop symptoms in the foot and ankle. Inflammation causes damage to the ligaments and tissues that support your bones, which can then cause the ankle and back of the foot to move out of alignment. If the ankle and heel can’t move properly, it can be difficult to walk, especially on uneven surfaces, hills, and stairs. Inflammation of the ankle and heel can result in malalignment causing pain on the outside of the foot. In addition to your regular RA treatment, you can also get an insert to minimize pressure or use an ankle brace to support your joints. Over time, the ligaments and cartilage of the foot can deteriorate, leading to the collapse of the arch of the foot. With flat foot, the shape of the entire foot begins to shift. Some people with RA develop large, bony bumps, corns, or calluses on the ball of the foot. These can be painful and make it very difficult to find comfortable footwear. Special shoe inserts can help improve the arch. When the arch falls, it puts pressure on the toes and the front of the foot starts to point outward. Toes become twisted and may cross over each other, especially the big toe. Many people with RA develop bunions, calluses, or claw toes. The combination of problems from the ankle to the toes causes pain throughout the foot. Over time, foot pain may cause people with RA to avoid standing or walking. In severe cases, surgery can help correct this by fusing the affected bones. If inflammation isn’t properly controlled, severe joint damage can cause the toes to take the shape of claws. The small toes take on a prominent appearance as they bend upward and then point downward at the middle joints. Sometimes, toes curl under the foot. Added pressure on the toes can cause skin ulcers and calluses. In time, claw toes can become stuck in position and unable to flex inside a shoe. In the early stages, you can wear soft shoes and stretch your toes into a normal position. Toe exercises, such as using your toes to pick up marbles, may also help. If your toes are fixed, try using a special pad or shoes to accommodate them. When your big toe bends toward the second toe, it causes a bump to form on the joint at the base of the big toe. This is known as a bunion. Because the foot must carry the body’s weight when you walk, bunions can be very painful. A bunion can also form on the outside of the little toe. This is called a “bunionette” or “tailor’s bunion.” The misshapen area in front of the foot makes it difficult to find shoes that are wide enough at the front. Home treatments for bunions include wearing wider shoes, avoiding high heels, and applying ice packs to reduce swelling. Wearing bunion pads can help to ease discomfort. Surgery can also help correct bunions in severe cases.

RA can also attack the joints of the knees, causing inflammation. This makes it difficult to bend or straighten the knee. Doctors use imaging tests, like X-rays and MRI, to see any possible joint damage. Typically, there’s a loss of joint space due to damaged cartilage and an outgrowth of bone, known as bone spurs or osteophytes. In advanced cases, bones can grow together and fuse. Treating knee arthritis involves medications and lifestyle modifications, such as physical therapy and assistive devices like a cane or knee sleeve.

Some people with RA, particularly those with more advanced or poorly controlled RA, form rheumatoid nodules. These are small, firm lumps that develop under the skin, usually near joints that are inflamed. The nodules can be small, or as large as a walnut. Treatment isn’t required, but certain medications can help reduce the size of larger nodules if they’re bothersome. In some cases, they can be surgically removed. Usually, the nodules are painless and pose no risk.

Not everyone with RA will experience all of these symptoms. Each person’s condition can affect their body differently. Often, people with RA may even experience periods where their symptoms stop, called remission. In addition to medication treatments, there are also diet and lifestyle changes that can make a positive impact on managing your condition.",mainstream

And if all of that wasn't enough to deter you from stepping foot down under, this viral photo by Queensland Police may do the rest.Two cops out on night patrol near Wujul Wujul in northeast Australia came across perhaps one of the longest snakes ever seen. The reptile was just casually crossing the road.Seizing the photo-opportunity, Sergeant Ben Tome sent his colleague Acting Senior Constable Chris Kenny out of the car to stand next to the monstrous python. You know, cop for scale.The snake quickly slithered away from the cops. Maybe it is not into flash photography.Queensland police shared the photo on Facebook and captioned: ""Boss, we're going to need a bigger ladder. During a night patrol near Wujul Wujul officers had to wait for this scrub python to cross the road.""The photo has 31,000 reactions, nearly 18,000 shares and several comments expressing their shock at the size of the serpent.""I need a map of the area and surrounds (say around 20000000kqm) to ensure I will never go near that place,"" expressed Norman Burns.Kelly Westgate said, ""I would have to turn around.

896,"It's just a pair of feet for right now, but you only need to see Pressure Plant from space in order to see why that's still noteworthy: these feet are gigantic. Fortnite has been threatening to build a giant robot for most of Season 9 so far, and now it appears that we're getting moving on things in earnest. The other day, the game replaced Pressure Plant with two huge yellow pads. Now there are feet on those pads, and you get a real sense of scale just by going near them. Here's what they look like near a player:

Big enough that it's almost impossible to actually show them in a standard third-person view screenshot, in fact. I assume that this thing is going to keep getting built over the course of the week, and it's got a long way to go: judging by the size of this thing so far it's going to be the largest item on the map by a big margin. At least, until it gets something to fight.

There can be little doubt about the purpose of this giant robot at this point. Earlier in the season, another giant monster emerged from Polar Peak and started swimming around the map with the castle on its head--or maybe the castle is its head, it's hard to tell. Regardless, it appears to have occasionally made forays onto the map to smash something up, but we haven't gotten a good look at it since we saw its eye encased in the ice. It appears as if it's going to come back, however, and try to destroy something big. It took a long time for Tilted Towers to finally get destroyed, but it seems like Neo Tilted might be under threat much sooner.

What we don't know is what this fight will look like. The best guess would be some sort of one-time-event of the sort that Fortnite has been doing ever since the rocket launch in Season 4. I'm not so sure, however. We've been having rumors of some sort of colossus-oriented LTM for more than a year now, and if it were ever going to happen this would be the time. Theoretically, we could have a big 2-team LTM, with one side supporting the robot and another supporting the monster, each trying to push their hero to a destination like the payload in Overwatch.

It could also be a pure PvE mode, of the sort that Epic has been more interested in recently. Whatever it is, don't expect a lot of movement before July 8, because the Fortnite team is on vacation.",mainstream
140,"The promise of future diabetes technology can be uncertain, even in the best of times. But there’s at least one exciting new connected system for people with diabetes that remains on course for launch in 2021 despite current economic woes, its makers claim. It’s coming from Northern California–based Bigfoot Biomedical: an ambitious next-generation Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) system known as Bigfoot Unity. Unlike other early “Artificial Pancreas” technologies that connect a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and insulin pump to automate dosing, the Unity system is designed for individuals on multiple daily injection therapy. What’s unique here is offering the decision-support and automation advantages of a connected system to a broad swath of people with diabetes who aren’t hooked up to an insulin pump — which is in fact the great majority. Bigfoot also promises a novel business concept for a multipart automated insulin delivery system: a subscription payment model featuring regular mail-order deliveries. “Think of it like a service, where you’re not being forced to buy each particular part of a system separately, but all of that is bundled together with a subscription cost and is delivered to your door,” said Bigfoot CEO Jeffrey Brewer. “You’re being provided with a solution, and whatever you need to use that solution (is) provided on a monthly basis.” While they do plan to create an insulin pump version of their product later on, the first iteration based on a “smart” insulin pen will hopefully be filed for review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later this year. The company remains confident despite the current pandemic that will undoubtedly affect every industry.

Since its founding in early 2015, Bigfoot has aimed to create both an insulin pen version as well as a pump version of its AID system, allowing people with diabetes (PWDs) the choice for whatever they prefer. In March 2019, our DiabetesMine team had the opportunity to spend time inside Bigfoot’s “lair” in the San Francisco Bay Area and get a sneak peek at the technology they’re building and company culture. A lot has changed since then. Bigfoot now has a new lair, after moving to a facility twice as large in a nearby town. The crew has also changed significantly, with several big names in the diabetes space leaving for other ventures. And the priority pipeline focus has shifted to the connected smart pen version of their product in order “to serve a larger, yet lesser-served segment” of our diabetes community. Here’s a breakdown of exactly what Bigfoot has in the works. This system uses a “smart” digital pen cap as the base for its design, originally developed by Timesulin and acquired by Bigfoot in 2017. Yet, it goes beyond just tracking dosing data. There will be two versions of the pen cap, one for basal (long-acting) and bolus (rapid-acting) insulin pens. Importantly, Bigfoot Unity will work with any type of insulin. The connected “smart” caps are designed to fit universally on all insulin pen models. The caps will read CGM data directly from a future version of the Bluetooth-enabled Abbott FreeStyle Libre flash glucose monitoring sensor to make insulin dosing decisions based on those glucose readings. Users will even be able to scan the Libre sensor using the Bigfoot Unity pen cap, in addition to current scanning with the dedicated smartphone app. With Bigfoot Unity, users can view all the data on a mobile app but won’t need to pull out their phone to get dosing recommendations, as those will show up right on the pen cap. This is the version Bigfoot expects to file with the FDA in fall 2020, and hopefully get approval by early 2021. The future insulin pump–based system is built on the Asante Solutions’ Snap pump technology and design, which Bigfoot acquired when that company went out of business in May 2015. That two-part insulin pump has a “brains” component and disposable piece that holds the insulin cartridge, which snap together. Bigfoot is now developing a screenless pump device with fun Bigfoot “eye” symbols (derived from its company logo). A smartphone mobile app will be the main user interface, so users won’t even have to pull out their insulin pump to operate it or see data displayed. Users will enter carb counts for meals on the phone app, which will then recommend a dose and allow delivery without having to touch the pump at all. The timeline on this remains TBD, dependent in part on fundraising for the clinical trial work after Bigfoot Unity. Both Bigfoot systems will interact directly with a mobile app, which wouldn’t even need to be opened on the user’s phone for it to connect and obtain data. The app will display data trends and transmit glucose alarms. Bigfoot and Abbott Diabetes Care announced an agreement in mid-2017 to integrate a next-gen Bluetooth-enabled version of the 14-day Libre sensor with the upcoming Bigfoot AID systems. This will be an entirely new iteration of Libre, where the CGM data stream will be continuous between pump or pen and smartphone app. That contract with Abbott is for the first couple years of Bigfoot’s commercialization, Brewer says, and after that they’d likely collaborate with other CGM makers to offer other options to customers. A likely candidate is Dexcom, which was an original Bigfoot partner before the Dexcom G6 “no calibration” version release. Brewer says Bigfoot is working to build a “modular system aimed at offering choice,” so it’s just a matter of time after the first generation rolls out. Bigfoot plans to be its own supply vendor, meaning users would order everything from them, bundled in their own branded packaging: test strips, lancets, alcohol swabs, and pen supplies or pump infusion sets (minus the needed insulin, which you’d still get the traditional way). The idea is to require just one single prescription from a doctor to obtain your Bigfoot system supplies in a sort of “one-stop shop” that would be delivered to customers’ doorsteps each month. Training and digital learning tools would also be a part of that, Brewer says.

Like other companies, Bigfoot has had delays and pushbacks on timelines in the past, and we all know that can be frustrating. Of course, the company has adopted a work-from-home (WFH) policy in reaction to the COVID-19 outbreak. But Bigfoot’s Chief Marketing Officer Red Maxwell says they’re making business adjustments to maintain the “aggressive timeline” for FDA filing of Bigfoot Unity by this fall. “It’s been a challenge, but the entire company is committed to get it in the hands of our community as soon as possible. The pandemic has only crystallized the need for medical solutions like ours that enable remote care, remote support, and home delivery,” he said.

In the past year or so, Brewer says their conversations with payers (aka insurers) and healthcare providers pushed them to focus first on the pen version of their product. That’s because people using injections make up a majority of insulin-dependent PWDs, yet this larger group is underserved when it comes to diabetes tech options. “This has popped to top of mind for insurance companies and large healthcare delivery systems that realize there must be a better way,” Brewer said. “We’re not looking at CGM as just a way to provide data to people. Rather, we’re providing advice,” he said. “We want to take those CGM readings and turn that into specific advice on how much insulin to take… and when.” Bigfoot cites Seagrove Partners market research showing that an estimated 6.6 million Americans are dependent on insulin as of 2019. Meanwhile, T1D ExChange data shows that across the board, people with T1D aren’t achieving optimal health outcomes (largely based on non-optimal A1C results). And with more T2s being diagnosed and put on insulin, experts are sensing a growing need to offer the same kind of cutting-edge, data-driven treatment for all. That is what Bigfoot hopes to address, using a “blue ocean strategy” to tap the vast, unmet demand of both T1s and T2s who may not be the most typical tech-savvy engaged users. That’s a business concept that involves “the simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low cost to open up a new market space and create new demand.” “The endocrinologists aren’t going to be able to support all the patients who need insulin therapy. So whatever comes, it needs to be simple and self-training, be able to lower the burden on the clinician profoundly, and be easily prescribed and be able to support itself. That’s what we are developing here,” Brewer said. He acknowledges that access is important, i.e., it’s critical that clinicians be able to prescribe this easily, that it be reimbursed by payers, and be affordable for anyone who needs it. “Removing the bottlenecks is critical: price, complexity, doctor familiarly, etc.,” Brewer said. “To us, it’s not either pen or pumps — it’s both. That is still a novel idea in the industry. I think we’re saying no one thing is the best. There needs to be choice, and it needs to encompass both injections and infusion pumps and probably patch and tethered pumps too. “These all have a place in the marketplace because they’re preferred by certain people, and the customer may change their mind over time for any variety of reason. We need that flexibility,” Brewer said.

Don’t forget this startup is named after the Bigfoot creature that was historically so elusive — did he exist or not? In early 2014, rumors began to spread within the diabetes community about a guy out there somewhere who had hacked into his diabetes devices to create a so-called Artificial Pancreas… but no one would publicly confirm his existence or real name. That changed in late 2014, when this diabetes tech-savvy “Bigfoot” outed himself and finally shared his family’s story with the world. It turned out to be D-Dad Bryan Mazlish from New York, whose wife and son live with T1D. He had managed to crack the code on a CGM and insulin pump to create the first homemade closed loop — years before anyone else was openly doing this. For the formation of the company Bigfoot Biomedical, Mazlish partnered with a trio of other diabetes dads also anxious to build best-in-class technology for their loved ones:
• Brewer, known as the “Father of the Artificial Pancreas,” as he’d been CEO of JDRF for 4 years and helped pave the pathway for closed loop technology
• former Medtronic Chief Engineer Lane Desborough, who had helped create the data-sharing game changer known as Nightscout
• Jon Brilliant, who had served as chief financial officer of WellDoc after co-founding the company years earlier Recently, their employee count has dipped from 100+ to 80+, but they are bringing new faces on board. Notably, co-founder Desborough is one of those employees who has moved on to other ventures, along with big names like Timesulin founder John Sjolund, Stanford closed loop expert and diabetes educator Jen Block, and longtime patient advocate Melissa Lee. “The organization has evolved and is becoming more mature, and as a company we’re moving out of the development stage into a commercialization stage. It’s a different challenge and requires different talent. There will be a time when Bigfoot outgrows me as well,” said CEO Brewer. “It’s still as driven in the DNA by people who understand and are committed to alleviating challenges of life with insulin-requiring diabetes. (Change) is a function of our success in getting to this stage,” he said. Despite those fluctuations, the company has marked some important wins and remains optimistic. Late last year, Abbott led a series C round of financing that brought in $45 million and sped the startup along the path of being able to finalize its first-gen product development. They’ve also been focused this past year on talking with payers to secure as much insurance coverage as possible in advance of their planned market launch in 2021. The company has struck up numerous partnerships to optimize this in-development system, including one with Pennsylvania-based Allegheny Health Network, allowing their endocrinologists and primary care doctors to help refine the provider-facing features for best-case use on the clinical side. “We’ve chosen to turn the traditional logic on its end, not just asking if someone is ‘complying or adhering,’ but what is preventing them from doing that?” Brewer noted. “Usually, if you look closely enough, it’s because (diabetes management) is too much a pain in the ass or requires too much attention, or there’s some aspect that is getting in the way. It’s not that people don’t want to be healthy. The fundamental design of diabetes care is flawed, and from the beginning that’s been our key insight and driving impetus in doing this,” he said.",mainstream
779,"On September 11th, four teams of hijackers walked past the security at three major metropolitan airports and hijacked four aircraft. Two were crashed into the World Trade Towers, one into the Pentagon, and one was apparently and thankfully shot down before it could reach its target. The media call these perpetrators terrorists. Given that we don't really know exactly who they were and what belief systems they were slaves to, we cannot know whether they called themselves holy warriors, freedom fighters, or something else. I doubt they call themselves terrorists for using unconventional tactics, no more than the American colonists who used unconventional tactics that the British found morally repugnant called themselves terrorists. But what we do know about these people is that they were educated. They were pilots. They were equipped to survive in modern American culture. Minus their hate, they could have been prosperous and successful here. With their hate, because of their hate, they were willing to throw their education, their prosperity, their futures, and their lives away in a blinding flash as aluminum ploughed into concrete with hundreds of innocent lives following just a few feet behind. How could anyone hate America enough to throw their own lives away in their attacks on the symbols of our nation's economic and military power? I mean it's not like someone just wakes up one morning and decides to hijack a jet passenger liner and use it to knock down a skyscraper and is willing to die in the process because there's nothing good to watch on TV. Nobody wakes up and says, ""Gee the baseball game got rained out, let's go blow up a building."" Anyone willing to commit such a crime as we have seen this week is seriously pissed off about something, and in order to stop more attacks we need to face up to what that something is. We're not talking ""lone nuts"", but entire teams of people willing to die in their attacks on our buildings and against our citizens. What makes these people so hate us that they would sacrifice their lives in their eagerness to strike at us? Maybe it's because America, despite lovely speeches about bringing freedom and democracy to the world, has a record of backing some of the worst dictators to be found. The US Government, for reasons of commercial interest, backed men like Batista, Pinochet, and the Shah of Iran, despots who drove their people into poverty to enrich American corporations until their people rebelled. Then we befuddled Americans scratch our heads and wonder why those people don't seem to like us very much. Maybe people hate us because what we call Peacekeepers still looks and feels like an invading army to those who stop the bullets, step on the land mines, and catch the bombs. Maybe it's because the US Government has executed its foreign policy by tricking nations into fighting each other. Saddam was our buddy once, when he was useful to our policy towards Iran. We The People paid for the Supergun. Our government sold Saddam the first of his biological weapons. Then our government decided they didn't need him any more, told him it would be okay if he invaded Kuwait and declared war on him, blowing up the Supergun and the biological weapons (we hope). Think maybe Saddam carries a grudge? I sure would if I was double crossed like that. We played the same double cross with Osama Bin Laden, our ally and a CIA contract agent in Afghanistan, funded with $6 billion of YOUR tax dollars, now branded a supervillian worthy of a comic book. Remember the last time our government decided to ""take care of Osama?"" We blew up an aspirin factory in Sudan. Big joke, that was. You, the taxpayers, not only got to pay for the million-a-shot cruise missiles, you also got to pay to rebuild the aspirin factory when the owners sued the USA, with Vernon Jordan as their attorney! Think the people who worked in that factory (the ones who survived at any rate) like us? I doubt it. Maybe the reason people in the middle east are willing to conduct holy wars against us is because so many holy wars were conducted against them in the past, going back to the so-called ""Holy"" Crusades. Jerusalem was conquered on 7/15/1099 and 60,000 non-Christians were killed. Bodies were slit open to search for gold coins they might have swallowed. Jews who had taken refuge in the city's synagogue were burned alive, thousands of muslims were chopped to death in Al-Aqsa mosque. According to the Archbishop of Tyre, who was an eye-witness, ""It was impossible to look upon the vast numbers of the slain without horror; everywhere lay fragments of human bodies, and the very ground was covered with the blood of the slain. It was not alone the spectacle of headless bodies and mutilated limbs strewn in all directions that roused the horror of all who looked upon them. Still more dreadful was it to gaze upon the victors themselves, dripping with blood from head to foot, an ominous sight which brought terror to all who met them. It is reported that within the Temple enclosure alone about ten thousand infidels perished."" Christian chronicler Eckehard of Aura noted that ""even the following summer in all of Palestine the air was polluted by the stench of decomposition"". After rude behavior like that, nobody would be welcome again. Maybe people are willing to use terror attacks against us because we use terror attacks against them. In 1985, authorized by William Casey, the CIA planted a car bomb near a mosque in Beirut to kill Sheik Mohammed Hossein Fadlallah, a muslim cleric. The bomb missed the Sheik but killed 80 people, including children. Is it really okay for us to use tactics we condemn in others? No, it isn't. If they are morally wrong to use car bombs that kill innocent people, then so are we. Or maybe the reason so many people hate us enough to die attacking us is something as simple as growing up watching your playmates blown to bloody bits before your eyes, and picking up a piece of shrapnel stamped, ""Made in the USA"". It is silly to think that anyone could endure a childhood like that and remain entirely positive about the USA. Because for all its public talk of peace, the United States remains the largest exporter of mechanized death in the world. And if it is acceptable for the victims of guns to blame the gun makers for their injuries, it must be equally acceptable for the victims of bombs, missiles, and mines, to blame the weapons makers as well. It is far less than clear just who is behind the attacks in New York and Washington DC. Fingers have been pointed at Saddam Hussein, Arafat, and ex CIA agent Osama Bin Laden. It may be any one of them. It may be all three. It may be none of them. It could be the work of a third party, unknown and unseen, with the goal of triggering yet another war where the blood of innocents will be bartered for greater wealth and influence. We do know that those who hijacked the planes went to a great deal of effort to steal identities of Middle Eastern Arabs and use them on their forged identifications. What also know is that wars are often started with deceptions. Sun Tzu states in ""The Art Of War"" that all warfare is based on deception, and that rulers must cultivate the appearance of moral rightness in order to persuade their nations to fight. When Hitler needed the support of the German people to invade Poland, he got it by staging a phony attack complete with dead bodies in Polish uniforms on the German side of the border. Recently declassified documents prove that Pearl Harbor wasn't quite the total surprise it was claimed to be. And the story about stolen incubators that angered America into support of Desert Storm turned out to be a complete fiction created by a public relations firm that has grown rich lying to people on behalf of governments, ANY governments, and whose executives have bragged, &ldquoWe would represent Satan, if he paid us.&rdquo Forget for a moment who was hurt in these attacks, and study who benefited. A few weeks ago the USA was factionalized, her people justly critical of the policies of the government, questioning even if that government's taxes were legal, questioning the support of Israel, questioning the handling of the Condit case, questioning Waco, questioning a self-critical nation demanding answers to some tough questions; answers the government did not have. Now, the United States has been transformed. All criticism is gone, Criticism itself is now deemed to be, instead of the right of the people, an act of treason. In the blink of an eye our nation has gone from being 266 million thinking citizens wanting to know if the government is right to 266 million conscripts willing to follow the government into war even if it is wrong. In the blink of an eye the people have stopped blaming the government for the worsening economy and shifted that blame to the &ldquoterrorists&rdquo. The government of the United States has reasserted its power over the people. It is stronger, much stronger, because if this attack. And any educated student of history would know ahead of time that this strengthening of the US government's power would be the result of horrendous attacks such as we have seen.. Israel, criticized by the world for its treatment of displaced Palestinians, now finds that criticism silenced. For the foreseeable future, Israel can do what it will with the Palestinians, immune from the censure of the world's press, burying the Palestinian cause under the rubble of the World Trade Towers. Unless he is still working for the CIA, Osama Bin Laden would not have wanted to cause any of the changes which have resulted from the horrific attacks on New York and Washington DC. The attacks made the US government stronger. Who benefits from that? That stronger US Government is now ready to wage war against the Arabs. Who benefits from that? Who really gained from the attacks in New York and Washington DC? Whose political agendas were advanced by the attacks? That is where to look for the planners of the World Trade Towers attacks. That we have been attacked is certain. But before we send out the cruise missiles to prove how big our national dick is, we had better make sure we are aimed at the right party, and not just being suckered into bombing someone that the real planners and perpetrators of the World Trade Center attack want to trick us into bombing. Because if, in the heat of the moment and the lust for vengeance we surrender our basic American principles such as demand for proof beyond a reasonable doubt, then we ourselves will have damaged America and what it stands for far more than those who attacked the World Trade Center could ever do themselves. What the hijackers could not knock down, we will have thrown down ourselves. If we do that, then those who planned and carried out the attacks against the World Trade Towers and the Pentagon will have won, even if we hunt them down and kill them. Don't be a slave to your beliefs about what a government could or could not do. History is full of governments that perpetrated monumental frauds upon their own people to trigger a war. Governments HAVE to commit fraud to start a war because most people, especially Americans, refuse to initiate a war of conquest. They have to have the illusion they have been attacked first. 5,000 lives are a lot. But to a government, ours or anyone else's, it's a tiny fraction of a percent to sacrifice to bring 100% of the nation under control, isn't it? And if we go into a protracted war in Afghanistan, a region that has resisted invasion for the last 2000 years, we will soon long for the days when our dead could be counted in mere thousands. The World Trade Towers cost a billion dollars. That's 1/10th of a percent of what the Department Of Defense misplaced last year, and a drop in the barrel compared to the worth of the oil sitting under the lands the US is about to attack. Are you really so sure you have been told the truth about what is going on?",conspiracy

BIG! Film series screening: North by Northwest

 Saturday, June 27, at noon, William G. McGowan Theater

 In North by Northwest, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), an unsuspecting businessman, is mistaken for a spy by a foreign agent (James Mason). With a chase by a crop-dusting biplane to the climax atop the faces of Mount Rushmore, action ensues at every corner. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. (136 minutes, 1959).

BIG! Exhibition

 The National Archives celebrates its 75th year in 2009 with a new exhibition featuring big records, big events, and big ideas. At a time when many people struggle to see documents and images on smaller and smaller screens, the National Archives exhibition “BIG!” presents the nation’s original record in its full-scale glory. From the 13-foot scroll of the Articles of Confederation, the first constitution of the United States, to the size 22 sneaker of basketball legend Shaquille O’Neal, the items in the exhibition are pieces of the American story—writ large. The exhibit, on display in the Lawrence F. O’Brien Gallery of the National Archives Building, runs through January 3, 2010. Spring hours (through Labor Day) are 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., daily. Admission is free. BIG! related items and the book featured above are available in the Archives Shop. Call (202) 357-5271.

All programs are free and open to the public. To verify dates and times of the programs, call 202-357-5000 or view the Calendar of Events online.

953,"The contentious clip was first released in 1967, sending shockwaves across the globe after the filmmakers claimed this shows the first-ever footage of a female Bigfoot.

Roger Patterson and Robert ""Bob"" Gimlin shot the video in a remote area of northern California, maintaining that the shaky clip was completely genuine for years after the event.

Footage shows a giant gorilla-like creature striding across the woods, but standing upright like a human, before turning around and glaring at the camera.

427,"Kurt Svoboda knew from day one that science meant sacrifices: pulling long hours, sweating over the data, and starving his personal life for professional success. What the young assistant professor at Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge didn't realize was that time spent on grant proposals, not groundbreaking experiments, would be the big stressor.

Svoboda, who turned 40 in January, wants to study how nicotine affects brain development in zebrafish, as a model of fetal exposure in women who smoke during pregnancy. Last summer, his tenure review was little more than a year away, but he had yet to secure an unspoken prerequisite: a federal grant. It wasn't for lack of trying. Since landing his job at LSU in 2002, Svoboda has been on a continuous hunt for money, five times submitting or resubmitting major applications, along with two smaller ones. Last summer, he was down to his third and final chance for approval of a revised R01, the National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) bread-and-butter grant. Without one, Svoboda suspected he would lose his job.

He and his two graduate students worked 12-hour days cranking out data they hoped would sway the reviewers. The final version of the application contained 27 data figures, Svoboda says. “I've never seen a person work so hard in my life,” says Svoboda's LSU colleague, neurobiologist John Caprio.

From California to Louisiana to Massachusetts, thousands of biomedical researchers find themselves in a similar financial bind. This year will be the fourth in a row that the budget of NIH, the wealthiest research agency in the world, has not kept pace with biomedical inflation. The slowdown is one of the longest veteran scientists can recall.

To make matters worse, there may not be much sympathy for these scientists on the outside. Biomedicine is considered rich and well-protected territory. Indeed, today's crunch comes after a heady 5 years of growth, as the NIH budget doubled between 1998 and 2003. But people on the inside know the money crunch is real. “You're almost in a different movie now,” says Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), one of the largest of NIH's 27 institutes and centers. The percentage of research proposals funded by NIH has dropped from 32% in 2001 to a projected 21% this year. Funded grants are routinely cut by 10% or more.

Dozens of investigators interviewed by Science, along with six NIH institute directors and agency head Elias Zerhouni, describe a climate in which young scientists struggle to launch their careers and even the most senior are trimming their research projects. Harold Varmus, a Nobel Prize winner who led NIH from 1993 to 1999 and is now head of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, has had his grant cut, although he won't say by how much.

Still, with a budget totaling $29.2 billion in 2007, NIH is hardly a pauper. What brought biomedical research to this place of financial anxiety? The doubling flooded NIH with billions more dollars over a relatively brief time. Whereas a private corporation might conserve some of this windfall, by law NIH must spend nearly all the money it receives the year it receives it. That provoked a massive expansion in biomedical research, and expectations of federal support surged to a level that could not be sustained when the budget stopped growing. The crash is hitting labs, careers, and the psyches of scientists with a vengeance.

Nine years ago, Congress set out to double the NIH budget and within 5 years sent it soaring from $13.7 billion to $27.1 billion. But everyone knew the golden days would not last. In October 2000, eight senior scientists and policymakers began meeting informally to discuss how to maintain the momentum. In 2002, the group published a commentary in Science presenting different budget models and their impacts on research priorities (Science, 24 May 2002, p. 1401). Its most pessimistic prediction modeled annual increases of 4%. Says David Korn, a former Stanford University dean now at the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) in Washington, D.C., who helped bring the group together: “We didn't model increases below 4% a year because the tradeoffs and the sacrifices that would have been caused … were too difficult for us to deal with in the model.” At NIH, senior officials found that “no matter what, there will be pain after the doubling,” says Zerhouni, who became NIH director in 2002. To soften the blow, in 2002 and 2003, NIH tried to accelerate the pace of one-time expenditures such as construction, to free up money for the following years. But even “in the worst scenarios, people really didn't think that the NIH budget would go below inflation,” says Zerhouni, an outcome he attributes to the 9/11 attacks, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and Hurricane Katrina. Meanwhile, research institutions everywhere were breaking ground on new facilities and expanding their faculty. In a 2002 survey, AAMC found that new construction at medical schools had exploded: From 1990 to 1997, schools invested $2.2 billion in new construction, compared to $3.9 billion from 1998 to 2002. But that paled in comparison to what was to come: an expected $7.4 billion in new construction from 2002 to 2007. AAMC has not yet confirmed whether these plans were carried out. Schools hired new faculty members to fill the buildings, expecting to recoup their investments from the NIH grants investigators would haul in. “Universities and their leadership did what I would have done too,” says Zerhouni. “The government is indicating support for these activities,” and the expansion was “exactly what Congress intended.” This appears to have helped drive more applicants to NIH. In 1998, fewer than 20,000 scientists sought research grants from the agency; in 2006, that number was more than 33,000, and according to NIH forecasts, the number of applicants is expected to top 35,000 in 2007. The number of applications has grown at an even faster clip, as scientists, concerned about their chance of getting funded, are submitting proposals more frequently. Because growth at medical schools lagged somewhat behind the doubling, many institutions are still expanding. At Sloan-Kettering, for example, officials only recently began filling a new building with scientists. They expect to increase their faculty by almost 50%, says Varmus. But as requests for NIH money edged upward, NIH's resources began to drop. After a 16% increase in 2003, the final year of the doubling, NIH received a 3% boost in 2004, an abrupt reversal of fortune. Although the general rate of inflation in 2006 was 3.1%, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the cost of goods and services in biomedical research and development rose 4.5%. The number of competing grants NIH funded peaked in 2003 and has been dropping since. The declining value of NIH's dollars and rising demand were “a perfect double whammy,” says Zerhouni. Yet the numbers fail to convey the gnawing unease and foreboding expressed by scientists across disciplines and at every stage of their careers. “The ripple effect here is amazing and paralyzing,” says Steven Dowdy, a cancer biologist at the University of California, San Diego. At Brown University, molecular cell biologist Susan Gerbi, who helps oversee graduate training, canvassed 49 faculty members in eight departments recently, as she does every year, to see how many would take on a graduate student from next year's pack. “In the past, it was a majority,” around 90% of those who responded, she says. “This year, only about 25% of the trainers said they would be interested … because they did not have a guarantee of funding for next fall.” “What's chilling” about the drought is that “we're getting into years 3 and 4 with no end in sight,” says Edward Benz Jr., the president and CEO of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Many researchers noted that the pressures on the federal budget, including the war in Iraq, leave Congress little room to expand or even stabilize other programs.

Alan Schneyer, a 52-year-old reproductive endocrinologist who has spent his career at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, at first wasn't too concerned when his grant application failed to make the cut. Like Svoboda and all scientists applying for R01s, Schneyer is allowed to submit two revisions of an application in hopes of persuading reviewers to give a fundable score. Schneyer's work had recently taken an unexpected turn. After a decade of studying how two proteins affect reproduction, he had eliminated them in mice and hit upon a surprising result: The animals had superior glucose tolerance and an abundance of pancreatic cells that make insulin. “If you're trying to treat diabetes, this would be perfect,” says Schneyer. Schneyer says he went through a “several-years learning curve” transitioning into the diabetes field. In March, he learned that, on his third and last chance, he'd missed this year's funding cutoff by 3%. After 3 years of trying for NIH grants and failing, including two unsuccessful attempts to renew a second R01, Schneyer's lab has shrunk from six people to one—he works there by himself. Although the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases may yet make an exception and fund him, he's not taking any chances. Next month, Schneyer will begin a job that doesn't rely as heavily on NIH money, working at Pioneer Valley Life Sciences Institute in Springfield, Massachusetts, and commuting from Boston 3 hours each day. “It's very real that you won't get a grant, even with an idea and 20 years of experience and a mouse that indicates treatment for diabetes,” he says. NIH officials say they're hearing from many scientists who, like Schneyer, can't keep their labs running. “I get phone calls from people saying, 'I'm letting my people go, what do I do now?'” says Michael Oberdorfer, a program director at the National Eye Institute. “I feel like I'm doing a lot of social work.” Compounding the problem is that most universities and medical institutions rely on NIH money for the bulk of scientists' salaries and overhead costs and are not set up to support faculty members long-term. Traditionally, “bridge funding” could tide researchers over for a few months. But now, more scientists than ever are having to resubmit grant applications, with a gap of 8 months or more in between each submission. At NIAID, the percentage of proposals funded on the first try has gone from 27% in 2001 to 11% in 2006. Submitting grant applications takes more and more time, says neurobiologist Kurt Svoboda. Some schools are beefing up their bridge funding. Dana-Farber, for example, is setting aside $3 million to $4 million this year. Historically, the institute reserved $500,000 to $1 million “and almost never spent it,” says Benz, Dana-Farber's CEO. Even “the senior investigator is turning out to be a challenge for us to support,” Benz continues. Funded grants are subject to cuts—24% on average at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), for example, and 18% at the National Institute on Aging. In each of the last 2 years, says Benz, two or three Dana-Farber labs have found themselves hundreds of thousands of dollars short of what they say they need to keep running smoothly—money that Dana-Farber has kicked in. “The full impact hasn't been felt because institutions have provided a buffer, but the funds that provide for that buffer are disappearing,” he says. At Brown, Gerbi is running out of money and will submit her second shot at her R01 in July. In desperation, she's cast a wide net in her quest for funds, applying everywhere from disease foundations to the Department of Defense, and has about 10 grant applications pending inside and outside NIH. In the meantime, she says, the university offered her some money that will run out this summer—but only because she recently underwent treatment for breast cancer and an exception was made. If grant money doesn't come through within months, she says, she'll be closing the stock center she keeps of a rare fly species named Sciara and, in the worst case scenario, her lab as well. Many scientists complain that the tough funding climate is exacerbated by an excessive focus at NIH on costly “big science,” such as the Cancer Genome Atlas, which is using large-scale genetic sequencing to decipher the molecular basis of cancer and whose 3-year pilot phase is budgeted at $100 million. Projects like this one, many scientists say, are coming at the expense of grants that sustain individual labs and have been the source of much innovation over the years. Zerhouni denies that R01s are a lower priority than they used to be. “I hear that just the way you do, but the numbers don't bear that out,” he says. Still, centers have grown somewhat. In 1998, they made up 8% of the budget, compared with 10% in the 2008 budget request filed in February. The extramural grants budget devoted to R01s and other individual grants has dipped slightly, from 81% in 1998 to 78% in 2006. But it's not clear that this is compounding the troubles of individual researchers, says NCI Director John Niederhuber. Many big team initiatives at NCI, he says, are funding some of the same researchers who would be applying for R01s. “It would be ridiculous to think we should be doing things today in 2007 exactly the way we did in 1970,” says Niederhuber. “Science has changed tremendously.”

Nowhere does the funding gap seem wider than when looked at through the lens of age. “It's just about inconceivable for a brand-new investigator to get an NIH grant funded on their first submission these days,” says David Sweatt, chair of the neurobiology department at the University of Alabama, Birmingham. Sweatt has hired three young scientists in the past year and worries about their future. “I see it as this dark shadow hanging over people who are just starting out their labs,” he says. “They're having to spend so much time being anxious over funding, to the detriment of having time to think creatively about their research.” At Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, pediatric infectious disease specialist John Williams recently learned that his first R01 application failed to make the cut on its second try. Although NIH institutes generally give new investigators a bonus by increasing the pay line—from 12% to 14% at NIAID, for example, or from 12% to 18% at NCI—that only helps if the grant isn't among the 40% or so that are set aside when they're “triaged” and left unscored by evaluators. This happened to Williams, who left a better-paying job as an emergency-room doctor and now studies a respiratory virus that strikes children. “We love science, and we want to do research,” he says of physicians like himself, “but we have to eat.” Williams, who has four children of his own, appreciates that NIH is trying to help. But “the efforts being made don't seem to be very effective,” he says. As it happens, in 2006 first-time applicants actually had a better shot than established ones at scoring an R01 or equivalent grant on their first try: 9% compared to 7%, according to the NIH director's office. But NIH officials are increasingly worried about mid-career scientists, those seeking to renew their first or second grant. “That's probably where the pain is maximal,” says Zerhouni. Last month, NIH announced the Director's Bridge Awards, promising up to $500,000 to tide over selected researchers for a year who just miss the funding cutoff. But such assistance is not the same as landing a grant, which is “a big element in the tenure decision,” says Leonard Zwelling, vice president for research administration at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. Biologist Susan Gerbi of Brown University worries about losing her stocks of Sciara, a rare fly. Researchers early in their careers are eyeing the situation and wondering whether they should even try to ride it out. “We're losing some very talented people who are deciding that there's not enough stability here,” says Thomas Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health. One is Jerome Rekart, who was a postdoctoral fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge until he left last July for a teaching job at Rivier College, a liberal arts school in Nashua, New Hampshire. Concerns about funding were a major factor in his decision, Rekart says. Throughout his graduate school career and the first year of his postdoc at MIT, he'd seen mentors and respected scientists constantly fretting about their funding. “That was scary to me,” he says. Rekart's adviser, MIT neuroscientist Martha Constantine-Paton, says he came to her lab with outstanding recommendations and a number of publications. “This is not the kind of person you'd want to lose,” she says. NIH apparently felt the same way, awarding Rekart a training grant last year. By then he had already decided to move on, and he has no regrets. “I can control how well I teach,” he says. “I don't have control over the NIH budget and how many pieces of the pie are available and whether or not I can get one.” While some senior scientists predict that a generation of younger ones will disappear, others reject such grim forecasts. “There is a sense of unease,” says Varmus, but “I don't think we're losing young people outright yet.”

NIH officials are struggling, meanwhile, to keep the percentage of proposals funded from sinking even lower. But with 77% of the research budget tied up in ongoing projects, including grants that last several years, institute directors and Zerhouni say they have relatively little leverage. Many institutes have canceled or delayed programs, particularly costly clinical ones (Science, 2 March, p. 1202). At the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Director Elizabeth Nabel says she has put off funding a new hypertension trial, and at NIAID, Fauci says he freed up $15 million by delaying further development of an Ebola vaccine. At the same time, “we can't not have any new initiatives,” says Fauci. “Science moves in a way that you have to push it sometimes.” Today's anxiety appears to reflect what happens when funding patterns shift abruptly. “Once you've expanded the [research] capacity, what are you going to do?” asks Nabel. “You just can't turn off the spigot quickly and keep the engine running at full gear.” Still, she adds, decisions about how to prioritize biomedical research “are really made at a societal level.” In hopes of influencing those decisions, scientists, convinced that an increase in NIH's budget will mark an improvement in their fortunes, are lobbying Congress heavily. Some are also considering alternative funding sources. “The real question to me,” says Mary Hendrix, president and scientific director of Children's Memorial Research Center at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois, “is how to reconstitute the lost funding without relying on government support.” Hendrix, one of the leadership group who met years ago to look beyond the NIH doubling, favors boosting public-private partnerships and working more closely with disease foundations. States, for example, are increasingly stepping in to finance human embryonic stem-cell research. But ultimately, Congress will set the pace, and there are glimmers that next year's budget may reverse the years of flat funding. Although President George W. Bush has recommended cutting the 2008 NIH budget by about $500 million, Congress has suggested it may push the other way. In February, Svoboda at LSU learned that on his third try, and to his great relief, his grant would win federal money. He scored in the 17th percentile and will be recommended for funding at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. As a result, Svoboda is feeling a lot more optimistic about his tenure review this fall, although the experience left him disillusioned. “It's wiped out my personal life,” he says. “It's just been a brutal process.” Now he has a few years before he'll need to compete for funding again.",mainstream
293,"Bruno Richard Hauptmann, convicted in the 1932 kidnapping and murder of the 20-month-old son of Charles A. Lindbergh, is executed by electrocution.

On March 1, 1932, Charles Lindbergh Jr., the son of the famous American aviator who made the first solo, nonstop transatlantic flight in 1927, was kidnapped from the nursery of the Lindbergh home in Hopewell, New Jersey. A ransom note was found on the scene of the crime demanding $50,000 in payment for the return of Charles Jr. Three days later, the Lindberghs involved the authorities against the kidnapper’s advice, and the ransom was increased to $70,000. On April 2, at New Jersey’s St. Raymond’s Cemetery, John F. Condon, a friend of the Lindberghs, handed over the $70,000. The Lindbergh baby was not returned, however, and nearly six weeks later the infant’s battered and mostly decomposed body was found in the woods just a few miles from the Lindbergh home. The cause of death was determined to be a massive fracture of the skull occurring roughly two to three months before.

Following the tragic discovery, the Lindbergh kidnapping case became a sensational media event, and authorities launched an extensive manhunt for the guilty party. Using the serial numbers of the ransom money as a guide, investigators in September traced more than $11,000 of the ransom money to the Bronx, New York, apartment of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a German carpenter. During the subsequent criminal trial, Hauptmann maintained his innocence, claiming that a business partner, Isador Fisch, gave him the money before returning to Germany, where he died in 1934. However, other evidence also implicated him, such as the discovery of Condon’s telephone number on a closet wall in Hauptmann’s home and eyewitness testimony from the night of the kidnapping. In February 1935, Hauptmann was convicted; and on April 3, 1936, after a series of appeals, he was executed by electrocution.

In the years following the kidnapping, a number of people began to question Hauptmann’s guilt and the quality of the criminal investigation; however, much of this criticism was likely motivated by opposition to Lindbergh following the public revelations of his Nazi sympathies.",mainstream

18,"That’s perhaps the most popular question asked by opponents of the theory – not to mention first-hand reports – that ETs fly their UFOs around the planet, abducting cows and people, willy-nilly, upon whom they perform medical exams and sometimes-painful procedures (think “anal probe”).

In fact, there’s plenty of physical evidence. Here’s some. You be the judge!

Dr. Roger K. Leir, the American podiatric surgeon, known as the “Alien Implant Doctor,” is best known for performing 16 surgeries and removed 17 “alien” implants during his 40-year career. He challenged the conventional scientific community by showing physical evidence – the objects he removed – as proof of extraterrestrial intervention right here on good old Earth.

An avid UFOlogist from boyhood, Dr. Leir became the State Section Director of MUFON Ventura/Santa Barbara, CA. From his association with that group, two people from different parts of Texas brought him x-rays of foreign objects embedded in their bodies, unaccountable by prior surgeries, injuries or splinters:

1.) Pat Parrinellio, 47 years old, had an object embedded in the back of his left hand.

2.) “Mary Jones” (not her real name), 52 years old, had two objects in her left big toe.

On August 19, 1995, Dr. Leir and his surgical team removed these objects. Finding them curious – dare I say “unearthly?” – the foot-doctoring UFOlogist had two pathologists and several independent laboratories test and analyze the evidence.

Even as the first three implants were being studied, two more women from different parts of California – Dorothy O’Hara, 61 years old, and Alice Leavy, 40 years old – underwent surgeries on May 18, 1996, where Dr. Lehr removed objects similar to the first three! In January 1997 another foot surgery produced an object described as “crystalline” from a fourth woman, the 37-year-old Licia Davidson.

The first set of implanted objects tested positive for being metallic, but the second set of implanted objects did not. If these objects are, in fact, alien tracking or monitoring devices, could different objects perform different functions?

Of the 17 implants, Dr. Lehr said, in a video interview, that seven “look exactly the same… I’ve synthetically divided them into three categories: ones that are metallic and covered with a biological coating; ones that are non-metallic; and one that is biological. Each operates a little differently.”

Are there biologist ETs out there tagging us like the wild animals we research?

Notable about all these cases was the absence of any memory, physical rash, scar, insertion point, or fever from these objects, raising the question: “What kind of technology or happenstance can explain how this object came to be inside my foot when I never had any surgeries in my life?”

“How do you get something into the human body and not have the body react to it? … You either have an inflammatory reaction or it’s a full-blown inflammatory reaction we call a rejection reaction. You just don’t get foreign material into the body and have the body sit there and smile at it.” — Dr. Roger Leir, 12/04/09 televised interview

On May 30, 1978, Tim Cullen and his wife Janet were driving in Colorado. They stopped their car to get out and look at a UFO. When they got home, they realized they had lost an hour of time. Years later, an x-ray revealed an unexplained piece of metal in Tim’s arm. He sent his x-ray to Dr. Lehr who filmed the extraction surgery of a 6mm metallic object with many attached nerve cells (proprioceptors) that didn’t seem to belong there. Again, the patient said there had been no skin reaction or inflammation to mark the object’s original insertion.

“It is my opinion that someone, or some entity, from somewhere else, is implanting these devices into human beings so that they can monitor genetic changes which are occurring in the human body. — Dr. Roger Leir [“Penn & Teller: Bullshit!” episode 1.03, “Alien Abductions”]

Dr. Leir founded a not-for-profit organization called Alien Scalpel – A & S Research Inc. – to study bio and psych aspects of alien abduction. The company’s website reports:

“These objects have been scientifically investigated by some of the most prestigious laboratories in the world including Los Alamos National Labs, New Mexico Tech, Seal Laboratories, Southwest Labs, the University of Toronto, York University, and the University of California at San Diego. Their findings have been baffling…some of the tests show metallurgical anomalies such as highly Magnetic Iron that is without crystalline form, combinations of crystalline materials mixed common metals, growth of biological tissue into or out of metallic substances, as well as isotopic ratios not of this world.” [emphasis added]

After surviving severe cases of shingles and diabetes, at the 2012 IUFOC (International UFO Congress) conference Dr. Leir said, “Although I went through a terrible time, health-wise, for some reason, I’m still hanging around. And one of the reason’s I’m hanging around is to wait for disclosure to come.”

The following year, in 2013 he testified as a medical witness at the Citizens’ Hearing for Disclosure for the existence of ETs and UFOs.

Critics and debunkers claim that Dr. Roger Leir was seeking fortune and fame, that the objects removed surgically are not especially unusual, that the laboratories used for testing are not reputable, and that Dr. Leir refused to surrender his implants to his nay-sayers for them to test.

No one can argue that Dr. Leir achieved a fair degree of fame, particularly in the field of ufology. Among his book credits:
• The Aliens and the Scalpel (1999) and Casebook: Alien Implants (2000) described his ground-breaking surgeries and his conclusions that these objects were of non-earthly origin.
• UFO Crash in Brazil (2005) reported the results of his investigation in Varginha, Brazil into “the Brazilian Roswell” event of 1996, which featured multiple witnesses and military documentation.

Dr. Leir appeared in several television documentaries, including the History Channel’s UFO Hunters, and was a frequent guest on ufology podcast talk shows. He lectured in 42 countries and was invited to present at the prestigious Society for Scientific Exploration in Paris, France. He also looked into the 2007-2009 UFO sightings reported from Kumburgaz, Turkey.

The ground-breaking UFO investigator Dr. Roger K. Leir died Friday, March 14, 2014, never experiencing the full disclosure for which he “hung around”.

Returning to the critical question posed at the beginning of this article, given this – and other well-documented cases of ET and UFO activities – the analogous question on UFOlogy Street is:

“What will it take to get full ET/UFO disclosure?”

From the 1960s to the present day, alien abduction stories continue… and continue to get almost no serious mainstream media coverage. What does this mean to our society? Our past? Our future?

978,"Big news broke last week that could change the future of closed loop technology.

OK, it's tempting to refer to this as ""Bigfoot"" news... as in Bigfoot Biomedical, the closed loop (aka Artificial Pancreas system) startup based in Milpitas, CA, led by an all-star D-Dad trio -- former JDRF leader Jeffrey Brewer, former Medtronic chief engineer Lane Desborough, and financial whiz Bryan Mazlish (Mr. ""Bigfoot"" himself) -- along with many others well-known in the Diabetes Community.

On Thursday July 13, Bigfoot announced a partnership with Abbott Diabetes Care to integrate a next-generation version of their FreeStyle Libre Flash CGM system in Bigfoot's emerging closed loop system, which could hit market by the end of 2020 if all goes according to the startup's plan.

This comes just a month or so after the news that Bigfoot bought the Timesulin insulin pen tracker -- indicating that Bigfoot's eventual closed loop system will also connect with smart insulin pens.

Whoa, quite a powerful combo there! This certainly makes Bigfoot unique in the closed loop space, being the only developer at this point with clear plans to accommodate both insulin pumpers and pen users.

Just how will all this pan out? We recently spoke with Bigfoot CEO Jeffrey Brewer to learn more about the latest developments.

As a reminder, the Abbott FreeStyle Libre is a new type of glucose monitor referred to as a Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM) system. It consists of a small round quarter-sized sensor that's worn on the back of the arm for 14 days. Data is collected from the interstitial fluid (just like a regular CGM) every minute, but unlike a traditional CGM the user must wave a handheld receiver over the sensor to get readings -- and unlike current CGMs on the market from Dexcom and Medtronic, the first-gen Libre does not have real-time data connectivity. One major advantage is that It doesn't require any fingerstick calibration.

While not yet FDA approved for the U.S., Libre is available in 37 other countries since first coming to market internationally in 2014, and was most recently cleared in Canada. There's a body of growing clinical study data showing the Libre is accurate and effective for many PWDs.

A physician's version called Libre Pro was FDA approved in September 2016, but the patient version been before the U.S. regulatory agency since mid-2015 (!), and it's anyone's guess what the holdup is. Being able to read about European patients' experiences with Libre, American PWDs are of course anxious to get their hands on it.

But this new agreement with Bigfoot isn't about the first-generation FreeStyle Libre we'll (hopefully) see on the U.S. market very soon; it's about future technology that will go beyond the current iteration of FreeStyle Libre. Abbott's pretty hush-hush on this, so all we really know now is that the new Libre version Bigfoot plans to use will do away with the handheld scanner and will be able to share data directly with the closed loop system, making it function more like an existing CGM.

So does this mean that Bigfoot is breaking up with Dexcom, despite a partnership announced in July 2015? The anwser is yes. Bigfoot says it's been evaluating CGM partners since its inception and has now moved to Abbott exclusively. The agreement is for four years, from the start of the system's launch. This means each Bigfoot system will come with a Libre sensor, and customers will go directly through Bigfoot, not between both companies.

Why Abbott? It's all about calibrations -- or in the case of Libre, no calibrations. We're told that was a deciding factor in choosing between Dexcom and Abbott. The possibility of human error based on calibration issues was a stumbling block in designing a closed loop system that's supposed to automate care, thereby ""taking away the work"" of diabetes. While Dexcom has been pushing to drop calibrations for years, even their next-gen G6 is likely to require one calibration per day. So based on the existing Libre data worldwide, the decision to go with Abbott became pretty clear, Brewer tells us.

“In the first generation of automated systems, we think sensors that require calibration have been the crippling aspect of the user experience. We’ve learned from our own personal experiences and from what we’ve seen in data modeling, that calibration is the biggest risk to a closed loop. People don’t do it well, or consistently or even at all. And that turns out to be a big problem. Our concern is that systems that require calibration aren’t going to be as easy to use or as safe as those that don’t require it.”

Aside from adding Libre, the basics of the Bigfoot system as we've reported before haven't really changed in the past couple years. The ""Bigfoot Brain"" will be built around the former Asante Snap pump technology that Bigfoot acquired in mid-2015 using a pre-filled insulin cartridge and tubing. This is where the smart algorithm is housed, which does all the calculations for carbs, insulin delivery, etc, and a Bluetooth chip inside will talk to the Abbott Libre sensor and smartphone mobile app as the main interface.

Rather than a traditional display, it will have a ""belt-clip sized"" display with icons showing the various items such as BG data and dosing. Importantly, Brewer says the system will not have a set BG target (as Medtronic's current 670G does and others like Beta Bionics are developing). Instead, it will allow flexibility by having the system learn to adjust targets based on each individual's BG needs -- because, Your Diabetes May Vary.

As mentioned, Bigfoot will design its system for use by people on injections and multiple daily dosing, too. In early June just before the ADA Scientific Sessions, Bigfoot announced its acquisition of London-based startup Patients Pending that makes the Timesulin smart insulin pen tracker. This will allow the Libre sensor to eventually talk directly to smart pens, and transmit the data through the Bigfoot smartphone app interface.

""I don’t know why people are forced to be a pump person or a shots person. Why can’t they do both, using whatever fits their life at that point in time? Some people switch back and forth, and I think you should be able to,"" Brewer says. ""When you talk about consumerization, that’s a fancy term for just looking at the person and designing a system around their needs. That’s what Apple does, but it’s not traditionally what medical device companies do. That's what Bigfoot is doing.”

The clinical research is underway and will be the main focus for the foreseeable future:
• A clinical research study (CRC) study took place during the latter half of 2016 and wrapped up last year, and the results from that have been encouraging.
• Pivotal trials are expected to start in early 2018, and Bigfoot says it's working with FDA on what that research will look like. Once all those begin, details will be shared via ClinicalTrials.gov and the Bigfoot site itself.
• Much remains up in the air and some will be dictated by Abbott's timing, but Bigfoot hopes for approval by 2020.

The planned launch is now more than a year later than originally expected, which is disappointing -- not only for us on the consumer side, but for Bigfoot folks too. Their team of 50 people includes many living with type 1 themselves or a very personal D-connection, such as the founders being D-parents.

But Bigfoot never planned to be first -- Medtronic holds that distinction with its Minimed 670G hybrid closed loop, which got FDA approval in late 2016 and is now being slowly rolled out across the United States. They will eventually have a next-gen, more-automated model of a closed loop, and we're also expecting to see other products from Tandem and Type Zero Tech, Insulet, and Beta Bionics in the coming years. Not to mention the hundreds of (non-regulated) do-it-yourself homemade closed loop systems being used worldwide over the past couple years (including some by Bigfoot team members).

It isn't about being first, but getting it right and bringing something to market that changes the game, Brewer emphasizes.

In the past, Bigfoot has mentioned plans to adopt a monthly subscription model for this closed loop system, which they expect will cost less than combined pump/BG testing/CGM supplies cost today.

We're happy to hear that the Bigfoot team has been conscious of access and cost considerations since the start, and remain focused to making sure this can get into the hands of people who want it. No doubt, a lot will change over the next few years and we are confident Bigfoot will adapt as needed -- whether via a bundled-subscription business model (one of the most novel aspects of what Bigfoot's proposing), or changes in insurance and Medicare coverage.

Certainly, many will be surprised that Bigfoot is dropping the best-in-class Dexcom CGM for a device that's still mostly unknown in the U.S. It's odd to be asked to imagine a world of no calibrations, and to put our faith in a future product that in its first-gen offers comparatively limited data capabilities.

That's a lot to ask, especially when so many in our D-community are highly impatient and want improved technology NOW. See also: #WeAreNotWaiting.

Many also remember the FreeStyle Navigator CGM that Abbott discontinued in the U.S. back in 2011, but remains on the market internationally; it was seen as the best, better-than-Dexcom at the time and as a botched business move that it didn't succeed here in the States. Along with all the test strip recalls and customer service issues at Abbott, the company's D-tech has often been engulfed in storm clouds... but the fact remains, Abbott has some stellar technology.

For our part, we're excited to hear about this latest collaboration, and can't wait to see what materializes. In other words, the future looks bright and we continue to #BelieveInBigfoot as it moves forward with new options for better diabetes care!",mainstream
699,"This article lays out a framework for determining when to switch to a low-growth strategy and how to put it into practice. If retailers execute well, they can stay in the maturity stage of the life cycle for a very long time, forestalling decline.

To explore the problem, the authors studied the financial data of 37 U.S. retailers with recent sales of at least $1 billion whose growth rate had faltered. They found that the less successful retailers had continued to chase growth by opening new stores far past the point of diminishing returns. By contrast, the more successful retailers had drastically curtailed expansion and instead relied on operational improvements at their existing stores to drive additional sales. This allowed them to increase revenues faster than expenses, which had a powerful positive impact on earnings.

In pursuit of double-digit top-line growth, many retailers relentlessly open new stores, even when doing so destroys the profitability of their businesses. This addiction is fueled by Wall Street and a capitalist culture that’s obsessed with growth. It’s hard to kick, primarily because companies don’t know when or how to turn off the growth machine—or what to replace it with.

Companies in all industries eventually see their revenue growth slow. Retailers are no exception. Fickle consumers, intense competition, changing markets, and the rapid encroachment of online retailing all combine to exert pressure on the top line. The retail graveyard is filled with chains such as Circuit City, Austin Reed, Linens ’n Things, Loehmann’s, British Home Stores, RadioShack, and the Sports Authority—that expanded rapidly and then, faced with declining growth, couldn’t find ways to change course.

What should a retailer do when growth slows? Is it doomed, or is there a way to prosper when its business matures? To answer these questions, we examined the financial data of 37 U.S. retailers with recent sales of at least $1 billion whose top-line annual growth rate had slowed to single digits. Some of these retailers had seen their bottom lines fall even faster than their top lines; others had achieved double-digit earnings growth and above-average stock market returns. Our analysis showed that the less successful retailers had continued to chase growth by opening new stores far past the point of diminishing returns. By contrast, the successful retailers had drastically curtailed expansion and instead relied on operational improvements at their existing stores to drive additional sales. This allowed them to increase revenues faster than expenses, which had a powerful positive impact on earnings.

That may seem like a simple strategy, but it’s one that most retailers do not follow, for three reasons. First, Wall Street and the capitalist culture celebrate—and demand—growth. Indeed, slow growth is regarded as something between a disease and a moral failing. When faced with declining growth, companies are urged to go back to the drawing board, rethink the business, and come up with a new strategy to pump up the top line. Second, leaders of many retail chains don’t know when to make the transition. Consequently, they keep expanding until their chains begin to collapse under their own weight. And third, growth companies and mature businesses require very different operating strategies. Many companies that excel at growth lack the capabilities to make the switch.

In this article, we explain when living with slow growth makes sense, providing metrics that can help retailers determine when and how to move from a high-growth to a low-growth strategy. We also offer a framework for creating a low-growth strategy that allows retailers to increase revenues faster than expenses by leveraging their existing resources. If retailers do this, they can stay in the maturity stage of the life cycle for a very long time, forestalling decline. Though our focus here is on the retail industry in the United States, we hope that companies in other industries will take the broad lessons to heart.

The retail life cycle follows a classic S-curve. Successful companies grow quickly in their early years by opening stores and penetrating new markets. Once the most attractive sites have been exploited, they add stores in increasingly less attractive locations. As their store networks become ever more dense, new stores begin to cannibalize the sales of existing ones, reducing the net sales gain for the entire chain.

Walmart followed just this pattern. In the fiscal year ending January 31, 1968, its 24 stores generated $12.6 million in sales and $482,000 in net profit. By fiscal 1988, it had 1,198 stores, sales of $16 billion, and net income of $627.6 million. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of its revenues and earnings for the 20-year period was exactly the same: 43%. This illustrates that value creation in the growth phase comes from scaling the business, not necessarily from increasing profitability. But growth cannot continue forever. (Had Walmart continued to grow at that rate, its 2015 revenues would have been $246 trillion, more than three times the world GDP!) Data shows that by 2006 new stores had begun to cannibalize the sales of existing stores, and Walmart was entering the maturity stage. So it’s not surprising that its top-line growth slowed, falling to an average CAGR of 2.7% in the 2011–2015 period. Walmart operates in more than 30 countries, and clearly growth rates differ by country, but this doesn’t counteract the fact that its overall recent growth rate has been in the low single digits.

Our study focused on what happens to retailers when growth stalls. We examined the sales growth, stock market returns, and other publicly reported financial data of the 37 U.S. retailers whose recent sales were at least $1 billion and whose sales growth from 2011 through 2015 had dipped to single digits. (We excluded companies that, growing at greater than 10% per year, hadn’t yet reached maturity, and those with negative sales growth that were clearly in decline.) We then split the retailers into two groups based on their performance from 2011 through 2015: those with average annual total shareholder returns (TSR), including stock returns, dividends, and stock splits, at or above 12.4%—the average annual TSR of the S&P 500 index over this period—and those with below-average returns.

The data vividly shows that slowing growth can engender stagnation: The operating profit of the 20 underperforming companies grew only 0.9% per year, on average, and their average annual TSR was a mere 2.8%.

But the 17 successful retailers demonstrate just as persuasively that it’s possible to prosper with modest top-line growth. These companies grew their operating profit 8% a year, on average—more than eight times the rate of the unsuccessful ones—and their average annual TSR was a whopping 21.9% over the five-year period. That is nearly double the S&P 500 growth rate.

To understand what differentiated the more successful companies from the underperformers, we examined their public information and interviewed current and former executives of Dillard’s, Foot Locker, Home Depot, Kroger, Macy’s, and McDonald’s. Despite very different businesses—some retailers are diversified (for example, L Brands), and several have operations in many different countries (for example, McDonald’s)—we found remarkable similarities in their approaches.

When you’re a retailer, nobody tells you that your chain’s high-growth days are over and it’s time to switch to a maturity strategy. To detect when you should begin transitioning from high growth to slow growth, you need to track the right metrics.

At first glance, it seems obvious that the time to make the move is when new-store productivity has declined to the point that the investments made in opening new stores hurts, rather than helps, the bottom line. But knowing exactly when new stores have become unprofitable is far from easy. It takes time for a new store to mature; consequently, early sales may not be indicative of eventual sales. Also, extenuating factors, such as economic downturns or natural disasters, can have a huge temporary impact on sales.

Our study revealed one measure that can reliably tell retailers when to slow the pace of expansion: return on invested capital. Not coincidentally, it’s a metric that research has shown is strongly correlated to the long-term appreciation of stock price. For retailers, ROIC is the ratio of adjusted operating income (operating income plus rental expense for the new store) to average invested capital (the sum of investments in property and equipment, capitalized leases, and inventory net of payables). To compute ROIC for a new store, a retailer needs four things: a sales forecast for the new store over time, operating expenses, the required capital investments, and how much the new store will cannibalize the sales of nearby stores.

Many of our exemplar companies—including Foot Locker, Home Depot, Kroger, Macy’s, and McDonald’s—track ROIC and adhere religiously to relatively high hurdle rates for new stores (the minimum rate of return that a proposed investment would be expected to generate).

Some retailers, however, ignore the capital requirements of new stores and focus solely on growth in earnings. This can lead to bad decisions. Karen Hoguet, Macy’s chief financial officer, told us that she was surprised when a competitor began to open new stores in locations that Macy’s had rejected. Later she learned that the competitor had based its decisions on projections of growth in earnings per share rather than return on invested capital. The new stores turned out to be poor performers. “We were right,” she observed. “They weren’t great stores.”

In addition to ROIC, we recommend that retailers track two others metrics. The first is revenue per store, which is simply total revenue in a year divided by the total store count. The second is estimated revenue added per new store, which is the difference between total actual revenues and the estimated revenues from existing stores that would have been achieved if no new stores had been opened, divided by the number of new stores. To calculate the estimated revenue from existing stores, take the prior year’s revenue and add the increase in comparable store sales (the revenue increase at stores that were open for at least 12 months prior to the current fiscal year, which are known in the industry as “comps” and reported on retail financial statements) and add an estimate of the cannibalization of existing stores that is due to new stores—a loss in revenue that would be avoided if no new stores were opened. Walmart is one retailer that tracks and reports a cannibalization effect.

Savvy retailers can use all three metrics to detect signs that they should be slowing the growth of new stores. If a retailer has significant international operations, it should use as the revenue number what the revenues for a year would have been absent currency fluctuations. Alternatively, a retailer can compute this metric for each country in which it operates, using the revenues in the local currency of the country.

As a retailer tracks the three metrics we’ve just described, its managers will see when new stores in a particular chain and in a given country are having a diminishing impact on total revenues and ROIC. When it reaches the point at which most or all options for expansion have an unacceptable ROIC, it’s time to slow the rate of store openings—or stop opening them altogether.

Both groups of retailers in our study slowed their store-opening rate from 2000 to the 2011 to 2015 period. But the retailers with above-average stock-market performance slowed their rate more: They added just 2% more stores per year while the below-average retailers added 4.4% more.

We cannot emphasize strongly enough how hard it is for a retailer that has spent decades in high-growth mode to turn off the store-opening machine. It has a large team in place dedicated to planning and managing the opening of stores. Employees throughout the company feel the excitement of producing double-digit growth year after year and worry that if growth slows, opportunities for advancement will dry up too. A host of consultants constantly urge senior managers not to shift strategy but rather to redouble their efforts to reignite growth. That includes making acquisitions—which all too often don’t work out. And the CEO, who has been selling a growth story to investors for years, worries about coming up with a new tune to sing.

For all these reasons, retailers often go through a long, painful period of denial before they acknowledge that growth has ended and it’s time to switch strategies. It’s likely that many of the underperforming retailers in our study are in this denial stage now. Indeed, in Walmart’s 2016 annual report, CEO Doug McMillon asserts: “We are a growth company; we just happen to be a large one”—a remarkable statement given that the fiscal year ending January 31, 2016, was the first in its history that Walmart’s sales declined.

Many of the high-performing retailers also went through a rocky denial period. Let’s look at two examples: McDonald’s and Home Depot.

McDonald’s grew rapidly and successfully through 1998 by opening new stores. In 1999, growth began to slow, but McDonald’s continued down the growth path, also acquiring other restaurant chains, despite the fact that this strategy was eroding its earnings and depressing its stock price. A new CEO (Jim Cantalupo) reversed that course in 2003. He divested the acquisitions, stopped opening new stores, and focused on increasing the sales of existing stores through improved service and customer satisfaction. Over the ensuing five years, this strategy resulted in a doubling of the company’s profit margin and a quadrupling of its share price. (During the tenure of CEO Don Thompson, who headed the company from mid-2012 until January 2015, the company’s performance deteriorated. It now seems to be back on track.)

Home Depot’s story is similar. Under founders Arthur Blank and Bernie Marcus, it was a store-opening machine and quickly grew to be the second-largest retailer in the United States. Decision-making authority was delegated to store managers, which made rapid (albeit somewhat chaotic) expansion easy. But after two decades, the board of directors was evidently weary of chaos, and Bob Nardelli was brought in as CEO to inject order. While Nardelli did that, he also continued to vigorously pursue top-line growth by doubling the store count in six years and creating, largely through acquisitions, Home Depot Supply, a wholesale division serving professionals.

During Nardelli’s 2001 to 2006 tenure, store productivity lagged that of arch competitor Lowe’s. For example, comparable store sales at Home Depot increased an average of 1.4% per year versus 4.6% at Lowe’s, which had a stronger sales staff. (To cut costs, Nardelli replaced hardware experts with part-timers and reduced the overall staffing levels of stores.) As a result, earnings at Lowe’s over this period grew at nearly double the rate Home Depot’s did, and the stock price of Lowe’s also doubled, while Home Depot’s stayed flat.

Home Depot’s denial phase ended in early 2007, when its board appointed Frank Blake to replace Nardelli. Since then, Home Depot has delivered phenomenal financial results. Blake reversed Nardelli’s strategy of opening new stores—and as we’ve said, this is no easy feat. It meant stopping many stores in the pipeline and writing off assets—tough actions for a company with a growth culture. Mark Holifield, Home Depot’s executive vice president for supply chain and product development, told us: “It required looking in the mirror and saying, ‘We’re somebody different today.’”

Where does earnings growth come from when a retailer can no longer drive up the top line by opening new stores? The answer is through operational improvements that allow the company to increase its revenues from existing stores faster than its expenses.

This approach helped our above-average group outperform the others. Though the higher-performing companies grew their store count only 2% per year, they posted 3.4% comparable store sales increases. This meant that the majority of their 4.7% average annual sales growth came from existing stores, so that expenses grew four-tenths of a percentage point less than sales. The below-average retailers had the opposite results. With a store growth rate of 4.4% and comp sales increases of only 1.9%, most of their 4.6% sales growth came from new stores—a major reason their expenses grew four-tenths of a percentage point more than revenues. By leveraging their existing stores, the above-average retailers grew operating profit 8% a year, compared with a mere 0.9% for the below-average group.

A comparison of Foot Locker and rival athletic-shoe retailer Finish Line illustrates the importance of preventing expenses from growing faster than sales. From 2011 through 2015, Finish Line actually grew sales at a higher annual rate than Foot Locker—9% versus 8%—but most of Finish Line’s increase came from opening new stores. Almost all of Foot Locker’s growth came from existing stores. As a result, Foot Locker grew sales 1.8 percentage points more than expenses, whereas Finish Line grew expenses 1.3 points more than sales. The differentials between sales and expense growth rates might seem small, but they are significant relative to operating margins, which were in the range of 10% for both companies, and completely explain why Foot Locker’s operating profit grew at a 23.6% rate while Finish Line’s declined at a 4.6% rate.

Ken Hicks, who served as the CEO of Foot Locker from 2009 until late 2014 and then as executive chairman until May 2015, told us that his strategy to improve operational performance relied on leveraging real estate, inventory, and store associates. His rules of thumb were that inventory should grow half as fast as sales and controllable expenses 70% as fast as sales. He remarked that it’s possible to leverage low- to mid-single-digit increase in sales growth to produce strong profits and stock returns. An implication of this is the need for at least some sales increase. In other words, this is a low-growth, not a no-growth, strategy.

There are many ways a retailer can boost sales from existing stores. Let’s look in detail at the most important.

Even if a retailer is not increasing its store count, its real estate group should not be idle. It should be closing unproductive stores, expanding and remodeling stores in the best locations, and carefully vetting locations for the few new ones. Under Frank Blake and his successor, Craig Menear, Home Depot has concentrated on refreshing existing stores and catching up on deferred maintenance. Foot Locker has focused on rationalizing the location of its stores, closing some and adding space where it would do the most good.

The extent to which customers can find the products they want at a reasonable price and get help from sales associates as needed is a crucial determinant of whether they buy something or leave a store empty-handed. Many analytics tools are available today that help retailers decide what assortment of products to carry in what quantities, how to price those items, and how many sales associates should work in each store, at what hours.

Kroger’s use of analytics is noteworthy. In 2010 it began deploying infrared technology that tracks when customers enter the store and then uses predictive analytics to estimate when they are likely to reach the checkout lanes. This allows Kroger to determine how many lanes need to be operating at any given time in order to meet its exacting wait-time standards. A large dynamic display informs customers and associates of the current wait time. Since the technology was implemented, average wait time has dropped from four minutes to 26 seconds, and customer satisfaction with checkout has improved significantly. Initiatives such as this one have helped Kroger achieve more than 50 straight quarters of positive increases in comparable store sales.

Retailers seeking improved sales at existing stores often develop new products to boost revenues. To do so effectively, they need highly disciplined methods for identifying and testing potential offerings. Consider Home Depot’s process for adding private-label products. The retailer first identifies market-brand items that are performing poorly and examines customer complaint data to see how the products could be improved. It then develops private-label products—for example, Hampton Bay ceiling fans, Husky tools, and Glacier Bay toilets—and continually refines them to improve quality and lower costs. Instead of using the cost savings to boost gross margin on the products, it often passes the savings on to customers in the form of lower prices. That drives more sales at existing stores and takes share from competitors. If a new private-label product consistently gets a 3 out of 5 or lower in customer ratings or fails to take significant share from the branded item, Home Depot kills it.

The effectiveness of your sales force depends on whom you hire, how you train them, what technology you deploy to make them more effective, and how you staff each department in each store during each hour of the day.

It all starts with hiring the right people. Ken Hicks told us that all Foot Locker applicants take an online test that measures their disposition toward selling and their fit with the Foot Locker culture. The company refined the test over time by giving it to current associates and correlating the results with their actual productivity. Company data shows that people hired after the program was put in place in 2013 had higher sales per hour and stayed with the company longer than people who had not been hired through the program. Foot Locker also optimizes productivity by assigning the associates with the highest sales per hour to work the most important shifts. L Brands, which takes a similar approach, calls this practice “putting the aces in their places.”

Training is also a critical piece of the puzzle. Well-trained sales associates who have deep product knowledge can significantly increase the percentage of customers entering the store who actually buy something—what retailers call the “close rate.” Dillard’s, which offers online product training to its sales associates, has found that each hour associates spend on training increases their sales rate by a remarkable 5%.

Another common way to improve the performance of salespeople is to remove non-value-added work from their responsibilities so that they can devote more time to helping customers. An exemplar here is Foot Locker. In most shoe stores, sales associates make many trips to the back room to check on product availability and retrieve items that customers want to try on. Those trips consume precious time, and many impatient customers leave without making a purchase. To reduce the time associates spend off the floor, Foot Locker introduced scan guns that allow them to check what’s available in the back room, online, and in other stores without leaving the customer’s side. The guns are estimated to have added 2% to sales.

Macy’s also uses technology to facilitate the sales process. Its “smart fitting rooms” are equipped with iPads that allow customers to request additional items or different sizes, which sales associates then deliver to them in the fitting room.

Most brick-and-mortar retailers would be happier if the internet, which made online shopping possible, had never been invented. But smart retailers understand that a strong omnichannel strategy can increase overall sales by giving customers additional ways to gather information, make purchases, and receive products.

For example, allowing customers to buy products online and pick them up in a store not only enhances online sales but also boosts store sales. That’s because customers tend to make additional purchases when they come to the store to pick up their items. Retailers also benefit from the opportunity to fulfill online orders with inventory in stores. This can help them avoid markdowns on overstocked items and minimize the need to expand distribution center capacity during seasonal buying surges.

Omnichannel retailers can also increase sales by optimizing their distribution networks to speed up order fulfillment. A study of one retailer showed that opening a new distribution center that cut average delivery times of online sales for some customers from seven days to three produced an additional 4% in sales from the customers in that segment. The gross margin on the additional sales was more than enough to cover the cost of adding a distribution center.

One retailer that understands this is Home Depot. It recently replaced two older direct-fulfillment centers with three new ones. The location of these centers and the stocking strategies and operational processes they use have been optimized for faster delivery to customers. Home Depot has also improved the accuracy of lead-time information provided to customers. Previously, it would tell all customers in all zip codes that delivery for a given item would be in the range of seven to nine days. Now it provides customized delivery times that can be as short as two days. “There is no doubt from our data that reducing delivery time is driving higher sales,” Holifield told us.

Things like your return policy, acceptance of credit cards, and store hours need to be continually monitored and revised to enhance sales. McDonald’s, for instance, made numerous improvements during the 2006–2011 period, including switching from a cash-only payment policy to accepting credit cards, expanding some stores’ period of operation to 24 hours, and doubling lanes for drive-through business at busy stores to relieve congestion. Bob Marshall, the former vice president of McDonald’s U.S. restaurant operations, estimates that these changes yielded a double-digit sales increase.

The good news about mature retailers is that they generate a lot of cash, which can be used to fund the types of operations-improvement projects described above. The challenge is making sure that the available capital is allocated to the most promising initiatives.

Companies should formulate and follow a disciplined capital allocation process that starts with idea generation. Retailers should begin by mining all areas of the business for process-improvement ideas, as well as take inspiration from other retailers. Some companies, such as Macy’s and McDonald’s, have innovation groups to find and evaluate improvement ideas. McDonald’s also has an innovation center, where it replicates store equipment and processes to test the effect of new products on service times in a given type of restaurant. According to Bob Marshall, the innovation center was instrumental to the successful introduction of the McCafé line of drinks in U.S. restaurants in 2007 and 2008. He estimates that they generated a mid-single-digit annual sales increase in the United States.

Once ideas have been generated, the next step is to evaluate the ROIC of each initiative and fund only those that exceed the desired hurdle rate. “The things you don’t do are often more important than the things you do,” Hicks says. Pilot projects should be conducted for each initiative, and the results should determine whether the initiative is rolled out to all stores. Foot Locker first put its scan-gun technology only in pilot stores. At the same time, it worked with Motorola to reduce the cost of the scanner, from $1,200 to $300. Only after the technology was thoroughly refined was it rolled out companywide.

McDonald’s, by contrast, seems to have forgotten the need for a disciplined process during Don Thompson’s tenure. “Management fell in love with their own ideas and lacked the discipline to kill products like Mighty Wings whose test results were questionable,” Marshall told us.

As internal improvement projects with acceptable ROIC begin to outnumber attractive new-store options, capital allocation will evolve smoothly from a scaling strategy to a leverage strategy. To successfully make this shift, however, retailers must clearly communicate their strategy to Wall Street. Investors like companies that beat expectations and hate those that fall short. Mature retailers should set conservative annual sales targets and explain their logic for focusing on ROIC. During Blake’s tenure, Home Depot began announcing increasingly high targets for ROIC, starting with 15%, then 24%, and now 35%. It has been meeting those targets ahead of its announced schedule.

What happens when a retailer has more capital than attractive internal or external investment opportunities? After putting aside cash for a rainy day (retailing is cyclical, and it’s easy to burn cash during downturns), the retailer should distribute the remainder to shareholders via dividends or stock buybacks, which the above-average performers generally did, undoubtedly helping their stock prices. Home Depot, for example, announced a policy to return at least half of available cash each year to shareholders.

The destructive obsession with high growth pervades virtually all capitalist economies. Although this article focuses on the retail industry, we hope it will spark managers and investors in all sectors to pause and reconsider when high growth is good—and when it’s bad.

Our analysis offers just a snapshot in time. It certainly does not mean that the poorer performers can’t join the ranks of the better performers or vice versa. (Even the more successful retailers have experienced periods of lackluster performance.) That said, making the switch from an expansion to a leverage strategy is a huge challenge for retailers. It often requires a new CEO—one who delights in the nitty-gritty work of improving operations. Sadly, all too many leaders of mature retailers just can’t seem to come to grips with the reality that their companies’ go-go days are behind them and that it’s time to kick the growth addiction.",mainstream
644,"Toenail fungus is pretty gross, and so it seems to follow that Jublia's Big J toenail boxing character is a bit unsavory, too.

When the purple-hat wearing big toe debuted during the 2015 Super Bowl, an AOL story claimed that ""Jublia quite literally put its grossest foot forward during its Super Bowl ad, in which a cartoon foot hit the field to tackle its bitter enemy, toenail fungus. It was certainly a far cry from the mix of racy and emotional ads we all expected, and the fungus among us got people talking--and gagging--on Twitter.""

That consumer disdain showed in the ratings, with the ad ranking as the second-worst in the game, according to USA Today's Ad Meter, garnering only a 3.22 rating on its 1-10 scale.

The Valeant ($VRX) drug was approved last June; it was acquired by Valeant through its purchase of Dow Pharmaceutical Sciences in 2008. Big J made its debut in the first ""Fight it, Don't Hide it"" TV spot for the drug last fall. The $4.5 million one-spot Super Bowl ad then kicked off the ongoing 2015 campaign.

In the series of ads, Big J changes hats depending on the occasion, donning boxing headgear for the first fight, a helmet for Super Bowl football, a visor for tennis--which aired around the U.S. Open, featuring commentator ex-pro John McEnroe--and a top hat for post-Emmy TV commercials that also featured actor Mario Lopez.

Valeant declined to answer queries for this article, but EVP Ari Kellen spoke at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference before last year's Super Bowl, saying the drug is off to a great start with 150 reps directly working the brand, along with the DTC campaign. The marketing money will continue to flow ""as long as the growth trajectory continues and the economic returns justify it,"" Kellen said at the conference.

Of course, turning off chip-and-dip eaters during the big game doesn't mean the Big J character hasn't done its job. Sales, as Kellen noted, have been brisk; Valeant quarterly reports show Jublia pulled in $270 million in revenue in the first three quarters of 2015. -- Beth Snyder Bulik

350,"Editor's Note: This story was originally published in the May 2003 issue of Scientific American.

The world lost the creators of two of its most celebrated biohoaxes recently: Douglas Herrick, father of the risibly ridiculous jackalope (half jackrabbit, half antelope), and Ray L. Wallace, paternal guardian of the less absurd Bigfoot. The jackalope enjoins laughter in response to such peripheral hokum as hunting licenses sold only to those whose IQs range between 50 and 72, bottles of the rare but rich jackalope milk, and additional evolutionary hybrids such as the jackapanda. Bigfoot, on the other hand, while occasionally eliciting an acerbic snicker, enjoys greater plausibility for a simple evolutionary reason: large hirsute apes currently roam the forests of Africa, and at least one species of a giant ape—Gigantopithecus— flourished some hundreds of thousands of years ago alongside our ancestors.

Is it possible that a real Bigfoot lives despite the posthumous confession by the Wallace family that it was just a practical joke? Certainly. After all, although Bigfoot proponents do not dispute the Wallace hoax, they correctly note that tales of the giant Yeti living in the Himalayas and Native American lore about Sasquatch wandering around the Pacific Northwest emerged long before Wallace pulled his prank in 1958.

In point of fact, throughout much of the 20th century it was entirely reasonable to speculate about and search for Bigfoot, as it was for the creatures of Loch Ness, Lake Champlain and Lake Okanagan (Scotland’s Nessie, the northeastern U.S.’s Champ and British Columbia’s Ogopogo, respectively). Science traffics in the soluble, so for a time these other chimeras warranted our limited exploratory resources. Why don’t they now? The study of animals whose existence has yet to be proved is known as cryptozoology, a term coined in the late 1950s by Belgian zoologist Bernard Heuvelmans. Cryptids, or “hidden animals,” begin life as blurry photographs, grainy videos and countless stories about strange things that go bump in the night. Cryptids come in many forms, including the aforementioned giant pongid and lake monsters, as well as sea serpents, giant octopuses, snakes, birds and even living dinosaurs.

The reason cryptids merit our attention is that enough successful discoveries have been made by scientists based on local anecdotes and folklore that we cannot dismiss all claims a priori. The most famous examples include the gorilla in 1847 (and the mountain gorilla in 1902), the giant panda in 1869, the okapi (a short-necked relative of the giraffe) in 1901, the Komodo dragon in 1912, the bonobo (or pygmy chimpanzee) in 1929, the megamouth shark in 1976 and the giant gecko in 1984. Cryptozoologists are especially proud of the catch in 1938 of a coelacanth, an archaic-looking species of fish that had been thought to have gone extinct in the Cretaceous.

Although discoveries of previously unrecorded species of bugs and bacteria are routinely published in the annals of biology, these instances are startling because of their recency, size, and similarity to cryptid cousins Bigfoot, Nessie, et al. They also have in common—a body! In order to name a new species, one must have a type specimen—a holotype—from which a detailed description can be made, photographs taken, models cast and a professional scientific analysis prepared.

If such cryptids still survived in the hinterlands of North America and Asia, surely by now one would have turned up. So far all we have are the accounts. Anecdotes are a good place to begin an investigation—which by themselves cannot verify a new species. In fact, in the words of social scientist Frank J. Sulloway of the University of California at Berkeley—words that should be elevated to a maxim: “Anecdotes do not make a science. Ten anecdotes are no better than one, and a hundred anecdotes are no better than ten.”

I employ Sulloway’s maxim every time I encounter Bigfoot hunters and Nessie seekers. Their tales make for gripping narratives, but they do not make sound science. A century has been spent searching for these chimerical creatures. Until a body is produced, skepticism is the appropriate response.",mainstream
991,"A congressional race in Virginia's Fifth District has taken a bizarre twist as Democratic candidate Leslie Cockburn accused her Republican opponent, Denver Riggleman, of being a devotee of ""Bigfoot erotica"" over the weekend.

Cockburn pointed out Riggleman's apparent passion for the myth of Bigfoot in a tweet, which has now gone viral thanks to her accusation and Riggleman's interview with Matt Kibbe on CRTV, a right-wing outlet .

Cockburn tweeted a screengrab of what appears to be Riggleman's Instagram account showing a lewd picture of Bigfoot on Sunday. ""This is not what we need on Capitol Hill,"" she wrote.

In his interview with CRTV, Riggleman says he is ""skeptical"" Bigfoot exists, but he describes elaborate theories about the legendary monster, telling Kibbe, “Bigfoot can attack you with infrasound, like an elephant — I just want to let you know — or psychic terror vibes, to make you run through the woods and crash into a tree so they can drag you into the woods and create baby Bigfoots.”

Riggleman, an Air Force veteran and businessman turned Congressional candidate, also self-published a book about Bigfoot titled The Mating Habits of Bigfoot and Why Women Want Him , the Washington Post reports . He wrote an earlier book about Bigfoot called Bigfoot Exterminators, Inc.: The Partially Cautionary, Mostly True Tale of Monster Hunt 2006 with an ESPN writer more than a decade ago.

The Republican congressional candidate has not shied away from the issue however, acknowledging his passion for the creature with a tweet responding to Cockburn's accusations, as well as giving interviews to major media outlets like the New York Times .

While it's unclear how Virginia feels about experimenting with Bigfoot believers, the internet is having a field day with ""Bigfoot erotica."" The Washington Post and Rolling Stone have pointed out that Bigfoot erotica and monster erotica are genres that are in fact available on Amazon, mostly in the form of self-published fan fiction.

969,"British feet are getting bigger - growing, on average, two shoe sizes since the 1970s, says the College of Podiatry.

Today, the average male wears a UK size 10 compared with a size eight shoe 40 years ago.

The average woman wears a size six versus a size four, its research suggests.

Our taller, heavier bodies are to blame - our feet have compensated by growing longer and wider, says the college.

Its poll of 2,000 UK adults reveals people also perceive that their feet have got bigger.

Over a quarter of men and 41% of women say their feet have got longer or wider in recent years.

A fifth said they struggled to find shoes wide enough.

And many admit to buying ill-fitting shoes - mostly non-intentionally, but sometimes for fashion's sake.

Just under a third of the women and a fifth of the men surveyed said they suffered from daily or frequent sore, aching feet.

Lorraine Jones, from the College of Podiatry - the research arm of the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists - said: ""Feet are getting bigger because as a nation we are becoming taller and we're increasing in weight.

""Increased weight gain places more pressure on the feet and means ligaments and joints need to work harder to maintain the foot's structure and keep you mobile.

""Over time if someone is gaining weight the feet splay to try and accommodate the increased pressure, which can cause pain, lead to mobility issues and increase your risk of developing osteoarthritis in the lower limb joints.

""Whatever your shoe size, the most important thing is to wear a comfortable, well-fitting shoe.""

128,"A few months ago, the big news in this village of 2,053 residents was that its lone men's barbershop had closed after 42 years.

As the summer wore on, however, many locals found themselves bantering about a more exotic topic: Bigfoot.

For better or worse, Seneca has become a veritable Sasquatch Central following a flurry of investigations conducted by a member of the California-based Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, which bills itself as ""the only scientific research organization exploring the Bigfoot/Sasquatch mystery.""

""My mind's open to anything. After all, they just found another planet. So, who knows? Anything's possible,"" lifelong Seneca resident Jim Maier, 61, joked.

The rumors also create questions. From how and why Bigfoot stories can begin in a place such as Seneca--about 70 miles southwest of Chicago--to the reasons behind our powerful fascination with tales of things that go bump in the night.

""Bigfoot is one of those things that people like believing in,"" said Dr. Christopher Bader, an assistant professor of sociology at Baylor University in Texas. ""Because, how boring would the world be if we thought we had discovered everything?""

Since Stan Courtney of the BFRO first visited Seneca, he has deemed reports of four separate Bigfoot encounters near town credible enough to post on the group's Web site. Two of the alleged encounters happened in early June, and the others date back to 1979 and 1983.

Courtney first posted two Bigfoot reports on the group's Web site July 9, prompting the Daily Times, a newspaper in nearby Ottawa, to publish a story about the rumors. After that story ran, Courtney said he received information about other Bigfoot encounters. He posted two more reports in late August.

All four of the supposed sightings were within a mile of each other in a densely wooded area just south of the Illinois River along Seneca's narrow and twisting DuPont Road. Three occurred in Grundy County, while the fourth was in LaSalle County. One account involved two Bigfoot creatures.

""We heard some commotion over in the woods, and we were looking down into the trees. ... At first, I didn't know what to think,"" a man identified only as ""Tom"" is quoted as saying on www.bfro.net, the official Web site of the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization. ""If anything, it could be a man in a suit.

""Then I saw the second one in the clearing as plain as day. I guess I don't know how to explain it, but I just knew it wasn't a man at that time.""

""Tom"" believes the creatures he saw in June near Seneca-- allegedly covered in hair, standing more than 8 feet tall and reeking of a pungent odor--to be Bigfoots.

To many longtime Seneca residents, such stories are actually nothing new. Tales of a towering, hairy creature stalking the woods along DuPont Road date back four decades, they say.

""Growing up, it was always the `DuPont Monster,'"" said Kim Tedford, a resident of Seneca for more than 30 years. ""The [Daily Times] newspaper story was the first I'd ever heard about it being Bigfoot.""

Whatever the names, countless towns throughout the nation boast tales of the supernatural. And like a good scary movie, those stories can provide a dose of excitement, Bader said.

""Every state has its roads where there's a phantom hitchhiker, and every town has its haunted houses,"" he said. ""Regardless of whether there are such things as Bigfoot, people like that thrill of uncertainty, that sense of danger. It's exciting to try and discover the unknown. And it's a lot more fun to have that little bit of doubt when you're sitting out in the woods.""

Bader says he once sat alone inside an isolated cabin in Washington state at 3 a.m. with a recording of a Bigfoot ""scream"" playing outside. The effort failed to attract any creatures, he said.

But it didn't fail to excite.

""The only time I've believed in Bigfoot was from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. that night, when I thought playing that tape was the stupidest thing I'd ever done,"" Bader said. ""I was scared out of my wits. ... But I felt that thrill.""

A belief in Bigfoot also can provide a sense of significance and belonging, said Dr. James Alcock, a professor of psychology at York University in Toronto and member of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal.

""One type of a believer is a person really fascinated by something strange, but who typically doesn't have much background in science, or found science hard or boring growing up,"" Alcock said. ""But if they jump on the bandwagon with flying saucers or Bigfoot, they think that they're doing some sort of science. And that in some way they're a `real' scientist at the forefront of trying to make a discovery.""

""It's a shortcut,"" he said. ""To become a paleontologist, it takes years. But to become an `expert' on Bigfoot, you just have to read a few books and join a few groups, and you know as much as anyone else.

""Another thing is that you're treated with respect if you join these groups. Nobody laughs at you. And if you also bring up ghosts or other [supernatural] things, people will not say you're an idiot.""

The BFRO says the Internet has made it easier for people to report sightings directly to investigators, without fear of public ridicule. Alcock contends the Web also has helped such beliefs grow.

""In small towns, there is more opportunity for a belief to spread,"" he said. ""And the Internet has a small-town flavor. It's a place where you can seek out those who share your belief.""

On its Web site, the BFRO documents Bigfoot sightings in every state except Hawaii, and the encounters occur almost exclusively in rural locations.

""Perhaps people in small towns have more time to think creatively or imaginatively, or they seek more distractions from their everyday lives, as compared to city-dwellers,"" he said. ""[Bigfoot stories] are fuel for the imagination.""

In Seneca this summer, many locals were having fun with the rumors. Groups of local teenagers toted tents into the woods hoping to spot a Bigfoot, while adults cracked jokes about how such creatures were coping with the heat.

But for some, Bader said, Bigfoot will always offer a big allure.

""For whatever reason, there's an inherent appeal to the myth of the Wild Man or Bigfoot,"" he said. ""Somehow, that's ingrained in us. ... Bigfoot is `everywhere.' So I'm not at all surprised he's in Seneca.""",mainstream
1270,"You know when Cian Healy is present at an Ireland training camp the moment you drive into the car park of the luxurious Carton House on the outskirts of Dublin City. In a sea of sponsored Volkswagens and Audis, Healy's gigantic Land Rover sticks out like a sore thumb.

The blue-grey Defender Big Foot, with its oversized tyres, tinted windows and air-intake pipe is just one avenue of expression for one of Irish rugby's freer thinkers.

A self-confessed ""gym head"", Healy manages to dovetail predictable athletic pursuits with his passion for art, DJ-ing and off-roading in his massive 4x4 – pictures of which he posts on Twitter whenever it falls foul of Dublin clampers. Which is often.

However, until February last, the loosehead prop's run-ins with Dublin Council's parking services were his only noteworthy brushes with authority. An Ireland and Leinster regular since 2009 in a particularly abrasive position, the 25-year-old's first appearance before a disciplinary hearing came after he was cited for stamping on England's Dan Cole during Ireland's Six Nations defeat to England.

He was effectively banned for two matches, but the IRB was forced into an embarrassing retreat when Ireland appealed against the convoluted structure of Healy's three-week ban. He returned for the draw with France having missed – and been missed in – the defeat to Scotland.

Cited for allegedly biting Western Force scrum-half Brett Sheehan, Healy was last night facing a disciplinary hearing in Brisbane and the prospect of becoming the first Lion of the professional era to be sent home in disgrace since Danny Grewcock, also for biting, from New Zealand in 2005. That will surely have caused him more pain than the ankle-ligament injury that could well end his tour regardless.

The softly spoken prop may struggle to cope with the opprobrium that will inevitably rain down if he is found guilty, even if he has some limited experience of what to expect in the wake of the stamp on Cole.

Then, the well-known Irish radio and television pundit George Hook fuelled the fires by claiming that he would think twice about recommending his grandchildren play rugby after Healy's ban was reduced to one game.

Also, the player himself revealed that he received a ""pretty violent letter into camp. I read the first line and gave it to Mick [Kearney, Ireland team manager] and let him dispose of it,"" he said. ""I wouldn't like to repeat it. It was a rough enough letter,"" he added at the time, before brushing it off as quickly as he could. ""I shifted that one quick enough because it takes a certain type of person to send hate mail. Those people don't really matter to me.""

That was about as revealing an interview as Healy has given in his five seasons at the top level of the game in Ireland. Neither rude nor arrogant, Healy usually gives the impression of a man trying to get out of the interview room having given away as little as possible.

An All-Ireland javelin, shot put and discus champion at schools level, Healy's focus on strength-based throwing sports went hand in glove with his schools rugby career, and in 2005 he helped Belvedere College end their 33-year wait for a Leinster Senior Schools title.

International recognition followed at schools, under-19 and under-20 level before, in 2007, the Clontarf FC player made his Leinster debut in an end-of-season Celtic League match against the now defunct Scottish Borders.

It took Healy a couple of seasons to nail down his starting place, but since displacing veteran Stan Wright, he hasn't looked back. Three Heineken Cups, an Amlin Challenge Cup and two league titles have been won as Healy became a crucial member of the formidable Leinster teams of Michael Cheika and Joe Schmidt.

And Schmidt's appointment as Declan Kidney's successor as Ireland coach will secure Healy's status as Ireland's first-choice loosehead, with 39 caps racked up since making his debut against Australia in 2009. But, as is often the lot of a prop, Healy has not – until now – grabbed as many headlines as lauded team-mates such as Brian O'Driscoll, Rob Kearney and Jonny Sexton.

However, he and his good buddy, the Ireland captain Jamie Heaslip, are known to level the playing field with their pranks, once filling Sexton's car with plastic balls from a children's playpen. When Healy cling-filmed Heaslip's jeep to two lamp-posts, the victim gleefully posted the pictures on Twitter.

Healy's interest in art has led to him painting portraits of O'Driscoll and Sexton, while he has more than once performed as a DJ at Ireland's largest music festival Oxegen, under his stage name Proper Church.

Throw in the fact that he is dating model Holly Carpenter and you have all the trappings of a pseudo-celebrity sporting star – except this shy man seems completely disinterested in the limelight.

However, he may now find it hard to stay out of its unwanted glare.

Wasps wing Christian Wade and Gloucester-bound flanker Matt Kvesic will make their England debuts against Argentina in tomorrow's first Test in Salta.

Executive Director Dr. Christopher Dyer organized a two-day Bigfoot event, followed by an expedition that cost more than $7,000 for taxpayers, according to KRQE-TV.

The conference was hosted on campus. KRQE reported that the college paid for the expedition. However, no student or faculty participated in it.

""It was the largest and most well-attended event in the history of this campus,"" Dyer said.

The University footed the bill for advertising, guest speaker meals, airfare and per diem. Self-professed Bigfoot expert Dr. Jeff Meldrum was paid a $1,000 honorarium plus expenses. The other guest speaker, Rob Kryder, was paid a $500 honorarium plus expenses.

After the conference, Dyer and some of his companions went to the desert searching for Bigfoot. Dyer said he and his companions did not spot Bigfoot, but they did see habitat.

""I'd have to say it was pretty much a blown waste of money because we did not find evidence because of the snow. It was just impossible to get around out there. So in that case, yeah would we spend money on that again? Absolutely not,"" Dyer said.

""Dr. Dyer needs to be much more thoughtful about how he undertakes these activities,"" the University’s President Robert Frank said. ""The type of expedition that just took place was not appropriate and will not occur in that manner again.""

Dyer used discretionary funds for field work, he said, ""people use monies from the taxpayers to do research. For Bigfoot or whatever.""

Jeffrey Gonzalez, a self-described paranormal expert, said he heard about the sighting from a local farmer who said he saw the creature and five others running on his ranch near Avocado Lake.

“One of them, which was extremely tall, had a pig over its shoulder,"" Gonzalez said in comments obtained by Fox 26, a Fox News affiliate. ""And the five scattered and the one with the pig was running so fast it didn’t see an irrigation pipe and it tripped, with the pig flying over.""

According to his Facebook page, Gonzalez is a talk show host and an investigator at Paranormal Central, in addition to being a technician at AT&T. He also founded the Sanger Paranormal Society.

Gonzalez said that the sighting is not that uncommon, with three additional Bigfoot sightings in the past five years, all located in East Fresno County.

“I would have never guessed in a million years that you would have told me there were Bigfoot on Shields or Ashlan Avenue. Right? So, I want to know what’s going on. Is this for real?” Gonzalez added.

He recounted two others stories, including one from a woman who said her two sons saw a Bigfoot in their orchard and one from a man who saw five creatures in the same orchard.

“What are the odds of three people, three different families, who don’t know each other, within a radius of 2 to 3 miles, come and tell me what they witness, and it matches up,” Gonzalez said.

The images are reminiscent of the famous Patterson-Gimlin film footage from the 1960s.

322,"HASTINGS, Neb. — Skeptics and believers alike can learn more about Bigfoot thanks to a new museum.

The Crossroads of America Bigfoot Museum in Hastings hosted its grand opening recently. Harriett McFeely, the museum’s owner, said she became interested in Bigfoot after seeing footprints on Mount Everest on TV.

“I was 8 years old and they showed pictures on TV of these footprints that the Himalayan natives called ‘yeti.’ I saw those pictures and never doubted it,” McFeely said. “That was when I got interested in science. I studied science on my own for years. Then, in 1967, Patty walked down Bluff Creek, everybody saw that and I was hooked for life.”

She said she got the idea for the Bigfoot Museum after looking at her dining room table cluttered with Bigfoot artifacts.

“I couldn’t see it. Just about everything that is in this museum I have had in my dining room,” McFeely said. “There were pictures, footprints and everything; it was driving me crazy. I have gone out to different places and given talks. I take different things to groups. I thought it would be so much fun for people to see that.”

The Grand Island Independent reports that the artifacts housed at the Bigfoot Museum include three 2,000-year-old skulls, Bigfoot hand castings and a picture of Bigfoot “Patty” famously walking across Bluff Creek in 1967. She also received hand castings from Cliff Barackman of the Animal Planet TV show, “Finding Bigfoot.”

She added she found a lot of the artifacts in her museum, but others gave her some items as well.

McFeely said she realizes some people are skeptical about the existence of Bigfoot, but she still welcomes them to her museum.

“I like skeptics because they ask really good questions and make you think,” she said. “In all this time, I have only had one skeptic that was really nasty.”

318,"You feel, the moment you enter Peter Byrne's home in the woods of Oregon, that you have stepped onto a BBC film set.

Here is Byrne, 69 and thoroughly Anglo-Saxon, dashing about in a khaki shirt appointed, at the neck, with a gold ascot. Here is the book Byrne wrote about a grand elephant he discovered in the wilds of Asia. And all about you--evident in the whir of computers and the quick bustle of underlings--is a great sense of mission.

""We want to find a Bigfoot,"" Byrne says, taking a seat in the kitchen. As he stares at you, his windbeaten brow wrinkles above his blue eyes. ""Ideally, you could walk toward it and, holding your hand out, shout, `Good morning!' I wouldn't want to hurt it, you know. I'd simply like to communicate.

""If I could do that,"" Byrne adds quietly, ""it would be the fulfillment of dreams, of hopes, the culmination of a life's work.""

Yes, you may think Sasquatch is just another fake Elvis in a monkey suit, but Peter Byrne most decidedly does not. He believes--believes the mystery is out there just waiting for a good man to crack it. He has believed ever since he was an imaginative youth in Ireland and his father told him stories of an ""abominable snowman"" that haunted Nepal, eluding humans and exuding a terrible stench.

""My father,"" he recalls, ""always said that he and I would hike up there, to search. We never did, though, so in 1947 I went with a friend, straight into the Himalayas.""

Byrne opened Nepal's first tiger hunting concession and, whenever he could, he trailed the snowman. He found some footprints and even an odd, hairy hand, but there was nothing definitive.

So in 1960, he turned his sights to America; he spent much of three decades pursuing Sasquatch through the Northwest. And again, he attained no absolute proof. The best he had on his 65th birthday was a plaster cast of a very large footprint.

But then, in 1992, good luck struck. Byrne received from Boston's Academy of Applied Science a very generous five-year grant. It provided enough money to found the Bigfoot Research Project, and to hire two assistants to help him launch the most high-tech monster search the world has ever seen--a search that relies on police gear, wildlife research equipment, a Jeep, a video camera, and, above all, a phone line.

Byrne has a toll-free number, 1-800-BIGFOOT, and a dozen or so people call in every month to report sightings. The old hunter takes notes and then, if a sighting sounds promising, he rushes off to investigate--to peruse the crushed twigs or watch witnesses imitate the horrible scream.

Every detail is logged onto computers. Eventually, if all goes as planned, Sasquatch's migrational patterns will become clear, and Byrne can jump into a helicopter.

There are, on standby, two Bell 206 choppers equipped with the infared sensors used to track prison escapees. These would zero in on the beast, and Byrne would shoot a small dart. The dart would loop into the Sasquatch's flesh, extracting a small bit of tissue--enough to fill up, say, one tiny test tube--and ultimately the creature would lope off, unharmed.

And the cameras would whir: You know the tabloids would be there. Indeed, they can't wait.

Last year, the crew of ""Unsolved Mysteries,"" an independent syndicated TV show, spent a week with Byrne filming a mock Bigfoot hunt that was replete with a Hollywood stunt man wearing oversized shoes.

Byrne has also been covered by ""Ancient Mysteries,"" ""Sightings,"" and the Australian Broadcast Corporation, and newspapers ranging from The Hood River News to The New York Times.

With all the fame has come criticism. For instance, Grover Krantz, a Bigfoot believer who teaches anthropology at Washington State University, argues that Byrne is ""a sham, a fake.""

Krantz takes issue mainly with Byrne's opposition to killing, which evolved after decades of watching bumbling tourists murder Nepalese tigers.

""I argue for humane treatment too,"" says Krantz. ""But in order to attain protection for the Sasquatch, we have to prove they exist. And Peter knows that the only way we can do that is by bringing in a body.""

John Green, a retired Canadian journalist who has written several books on Bigfoot, is even more critical.

""Peter Byrne is a fraud,"" Green says. ""He tells the public that Sasquatch is near human because that's what they like to hear.""

Green is certain that, ""if Sasquatch is real, he's just an animal.""

But Byrne feels the truth is far more complex: He likes to think of the creature as a convict.

""As a child,"" he explains, ""we played a game called Convict 99. One person was the fugitive. Others were the police; they tried to put themselves in the mind of a fugitive. Now we're trying to do the same thing. Bigfoot is out there, but where? Where is he hiding?""

It's a vast question and, trying to answer it, Byrne has forded an icy, chest-deep stream on snowshoes and slept out on winter nights with nothing but a small fire to warm him.

He says, ""It's like we're trying to find a needle in a haystack and the needle is moving and it doesn't want to be found.""

Byrne pauses, so again you look into those eyes--those piercing blue eyes that have seen the slopes of Mt. Everest, the roiling waters of the Indian Ocean, the charge of the tiger.

""You know,"" he says, ""we have a theory--and it's only a theory--that he covers his tracks.""

After a while, the phone rings. Some guy has heard weird screams in the woods. Byrne has said, earlier in the day, that 98 percent of the reports he gets turn out to be ""rubbish."" But still you start hoping . . . Maybe this time. . .

""And what did it sound like?"" Byrne asks, wandering about the kitchen. ""Could you pinpoint where the screams came from?""

""I see,"" Byrne continues. ""So you can't be any more specific than that?""

This report, sadly, will supply nothing new. So, in his courteous way, Byrne signs off.

It's a portable phone that he's using, and he sets it down very close at hand. The next call could, of course, come in five minutes' time.

450,"Factory farming is quite possibly the most horrific and destructive practice we humans engage in today. It sacrifices billions of lives each year and serves to pollute, not protect, the environment of our planet. According to the animal rights group, Last Chance for Animals, “97% of the 10 billion animals tortured and killed each year are [factory] farm animals.” So why is it that when most people look at their plates they don’t see the real story behind what they’re eating?

Let’s take a look at a video published by Factory Farm Drones about a man who infiltrated factory farm territory with a surveillance drone. In the video, you see a glimpse of how devastating factory farming can be on the environment as well as on neighboring communities who happen to be down-wind of one of these facilities.



“The waste falls through the floors [and] it’s flushed out into an open-pit like a cess pool. It’s easy for a big hog operation to have as much waste as a medium-sized city. Of course the pit will fill up so it has to be emptied and they’re emptied by spraying the liquid waste…and that can drift down-wind into the neighboring communities.” says Steve Wing, PhD, Associate professor of Epidomology at the Gillings School of Public Health at the University of North Carolina.

The city of Salem, Oregon had a 2009 population of approximately 156,690 people (that’s about a fourth of the population of Portland Oregon, Denver Colorado or Seattle) and produced 90,817.68 tonnes of waste, all things included. In North Carolina alone, there are over 2000 of these factories, and tens of thousands of tons of waste being sprayed into the air each year.

Steve Wing also states that low-income and colored people are the ones who often fall victim to this unsightly practice. A local who was interviewed for the video claimed that their family would close all the doors and windows whenever the spray came near their home and that they experienced headaches and gagging. Steve also claims that there are numerous studies linking these factories to asthma, especially in children.

These are not happy animals. Like any industry, factory farming is about maximizing profits while cutting costs. Unfortunately this equation doesn’t include the welfare of the animals involved. Most are trapped in small cages in which they can barely move, if at all. In fact, each full-grown chicken in a factory farm has only six-tenths of a square foot of space. The chickens will often become aggressive and peck or even eat each other. This has led to an extremely painful practice called de-beaking, which are literally cut off near the time of birth. That is, the chicks that aren’t ground up alive in “chick shredding”.

Unfortunately, other factory farmed animals do not have it any easier than chicks and chickens. According to the Independent about 88 percent of pigs had all or part of their tails cut off from a practice called “tail docking”. This is done as as result of overcrowding, where just like chickens, hogs will become aggressive and bite each others tails. In other words, the reason is “less tail injuries”, but we’re talking about cutting off a body part. It’s hard to imagine a worse injury than that.

Factory farmed animals are typically given too many antibiotics resulting in the animals developing immunity to the antibiotics, and helping to push us closer to the end of the antibiotic era. However, these antibiotics are not only used on the animals to treat infections, but also to promote unnatural growth in the animals. This is a problem because these antibiotic-resistant bacteria can spread from animals to humans via food and contaminated waste in the environment. The result is a bacteria that takes ever-increasing amounts of antibiotics to kill. Many people can not handle these high doses of antibiotics, especially children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with current ailments.

248,"Poland has been wiped off the map twice, partitioned, invaded, and shunted around like a railway carriage, at a huge human, physical and cultural cost. Now it has a strong stable government, with a growth record and public finances that put the rest of Europe to shame.

Yet Poland’s self-image has not quite caught up. Poles often fail to realise how big their country is relative to its northern, southern or eastern neighbours. And they often fail to understand other countries’ grievances against them.

That is particularly true in the case of Lithuania. I would not defend the Lithuanian government’s foot-dragging on property restitution in the Vilnius area, or the arcane refusal to allow ethnic Poles to use Polish letters in official documents. The relative resources and status of Lithuanian-language and Polish-language education is a sore point.

But the Polish sense of outrage jars. I recently met a senior Polish official who bemoaned the fact that Lithuania had even been allowed into the European Union and NATO, given the country’s “mistreatment” of its ethnic Poles. The idea that three million Lithuanians living next to 40 million Poles might have genuine reason to be nervous about their language and culture finds little echo across the border. Whereas Poles remember fondly the joint Polish-Lithuanian state of centuries past, they have no idea that Lithuanians remember it as a time when their national identity was ground down and away by a cultural hegemon.

I am also struck by Polish bitterness that they are not included in the Nordic-Baltic sphere, and particularly in the attempts by the UK to build ties across the North Sea to that eight-country grouping. Nobody likes to be left out of a party, and if I were the British government I probably would have invited Poland to last year’s summit in London, and I think Sweden would have been right to invite Poland to next week’s shindig in Stockholm.

But Poland in this sense is a bit like Germany: too big, and perhaps too grand, to get involved in such events as an equal. I have been to Nordic-Baltic summits where the prime ministers and other dignitaries sit around tie-less and informal, discussing freely the world as seen by small countries, ranging from Iceland (population: 320,000) to Sweden (9.4 million). All speak English. All use first names. It all feels quite natural. I find it hard to imagine Donald Tusk, Poland’s prime minister, fitting in there. Protocol-heavy Poland, with a political class that is still surprisingly monoglot, is in a different league from its northern neighbours.

Perhaps even more important, Poland is too big to fit into that club: it is larger in population (though not yet in gross domestic product) than all the Nordic eight (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden) combined.

Britain is big too, but is far away enough to play the role of a friendly visiting uncle (admittedly rather a cash-strapped and shabby one these days). It has not been a power in the region since 1935.

What Poland needs to do now is learn a bit of the tact and delicacy that Germany has acquired in past decades in dealing with smaller countries. You may be the biggest, or richest, or both, but you maximise your influence by not showing it. The best way to improve the lot of Poles in Lithuania, for example, is to make politicians in Vilnius feel that they have nothing to fear, and everything to gain, in having close and friendly ties with Warsaw. That day seems a long way off. But it needs to draw near.

83,"Following in the foot steps of New Jersey, this “feel-good” bill will do nothing, absolutely NOTHING, to prevent people from bump firing.

 From Hanna Scott at MyNorthwest.com: It was a big win for Washington Democrats and gun control advocates Thursday night as the state Senate approved a bump stock ban.

 The bump stock ban is among a slew of gun control legislation making its way through the state Legislature this session (See here for the other anti-gun bills, including large capacity magazine ban and license/registration of “assault weapons”). But it’s one that many have had their eye on. The so-called bump stocks are a trigger modification that allows a semi-automatic rifle to fire more rapidly — similar to a fully automatic. It was used by the Las Vegas gunman who killed 58 people and injured hundreds.

 This bill went through a Senate committee earlier this month where survivors of the Vegas shooting told lawmakers how dangerous the devices can be. A local mother who’s daughter was killed in the shooting begged lawmakers to ban bump stocks.

 “The bump stock modification on the AR-15 that murdered Carrie increased the gun’s rate of fire to nine rounds per second,” she said. “Think of that — a 30-round magazine could be emptied in just over three seconds. Nobody stood a chance.”

 Bump stock ban

 Critics complained the bill was too broad because it included all types of trigger modifications, some of which can just be used to improve sighting and accuracy. But it made its way out of committee. It was debated late Thursday night on the Senate floor where Republican Senator Mike Padden fought for an amendment that would not ban the bump stocks at all. He proposed other measures.

 “Rather than ban them, it takes a different approach and allows for the same requirements and procedures for purchasing and owning a pistol or handgun for the purchase and possession of a bump fire stock, including requiring a state and federal check at the time of acquisition,” Padden proposed.

 But Democratic senators like Jaime Pedersen weren’t feeling it.

 “This amendment essentially legalizes bump stocks with a background check and I think that’s the wrong direction to go in,” Pedersen argued. “The state has a very long history of not allowing machines guns or fully automatic rifles. And that is the reasoning behind why I brought this bill forward in the first place.”

 Padden’s amendment failed, but another amendment by Republican Senator Hans Zieger did pass. Zeigler’s amendment tightens up the bill as far as the definition of trigger modifications, so the ban doesn’t effect trigger mods that help with things like accuracy. The final bill only bans modifications that are specifically designed to accelerate the rate of fire.

 Lingering concerns

 But before final passage there were still plenty of concerns from some Republicans, including Senator Mark Schoelser who argued it was slippery slope for gun rights in Washington state.

 “Clearly, this is the first gun seizure in the State of Washington,” Schloesler said. “Because if you are found in possession, you are a felon. Turn it in, have it seized, be a felon. It is gun seizure for the first time.”

 The ban cleared the Senate on a 29-20 vote with four Republicans joining the Democratic majority. If it clears the House and Governor Jay Inslee signs it as is, the ban would go into effect in July. After that, it would become illegal to manufacture or sell a bump stock in Washington. A year later it would become illegal to own or posses a bump stock. Anyone who owns them will have to turn them in. They’d also be declared contraband that can be seized by police, which had some Republicans concerned cops would go into homes to seize the weapons.

509,"WASHINGTON - For the first time in more than a decade, Native Americans have the opportunity to question presidential candidates on issues of importance to Indian Country.

“This is our chance to tell candidates that they can earn our votes,” said organizer O.J. Semans, co-executive director of the national Native American voting rights organization Four Directions.

Nine presidential hopefuls, Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, former U.S. secretary of housing and urban development Julian Castro, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, Montana Gov., Democrat Steve Bullock, Navajo pastor Mark Charles and author Marianne Williamson say they will participate in the Frank LaMere Native American Presidential Forum.

The two-day event opens Monday in Sioux City, Iowa. Organizers say invitations were extended to candidates from all major political parties, although so far only these nine candidates hoping to unseat President Donald Trump in the 2020 election have confirmed their attendance. The organizers also say talks are continuing with several other campaigns.

Mark Trahant, a member of the Shoshone-Bannock Tribe and editor of Indian Country Today, will moderate a series of panels, giving tribal leaders and Native American youth a chance to air concerns and ask candidates questions on matters of particular importance to Native voters.

Semans expressed delight that many major news organizations will be covering the event.

""For two days, all of the United States is going to know we’re here,” Semans said. “We didn’t get wiped out, we are not extinct, and we have a political voice in which issues that until now have been set on the back burner are now going to be able to be discussed.""

Of the hundreds of issues of importance to Native American voters, panelists will focus on two in particular, said Semans:

The Remove the Stain Act, which Washington Rep. Denny Heck introduced in the House in June as H.R. 3467. If enacted, the bill would rescind the 20 Medals of Honor awarded to members of the 7th Cavalry who on December 29, 1890, murdered nearly 150 Lakota in the Wounded Knee Massacre. The Medal of Honor is America’s highest military honor, given out to members of the armed services who demonstrate outstanding bravery and valor.

“Our second priority issue for the forum is missing and murdered indigenous women and children,” said Semans. “Women and children are sacred to our societies, and in order for us to maintain our societies and cultures, we must do what we were taught, which is to protect women and children, who we are losing in outrageous numbers.”

According to the U.S. Justice Department, Native women are 10 times as likely to be murdered as the national average, falling victim to domestic or drug-related violence, sexual assault or sex trafficking.

The National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center has called on lawmakers to expand tribal jurisdiction over cases of missing and murdered women and children; allocate more resources for victim services; improve data collection and expand tribal access to federal criminal databases, among other measures.

“Actually, underfunding is the fundamental to all these issues,” said Semans. “We wouldn’t have to be discussing funding for our transportation or infrastructure, we wouldn’t have to have discussions on housing and health care and law enforcement if the federal government fully honored the treaties.”

In a related development, Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced Friday she will work with New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland (Pueblo of Laguna) on legislative proposals addressing chronic federal underfunding of tribes, as well as barriers to tribal sovereignty.

The last time Native Americans had a chance to speak directly to presidential candidates was in August 2007 at the “Prez on the Rez” forum on the Morongo Reservation in California. Only three candidates, all Democrats for the 2008 race, participated. Then-New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, former Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich and former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel took part.

This week’s forum is named for civil rights leader Frank LaMere, a citizen of the Winnebago tribe in Nebraska. He died in June.

124,"(Reuters) – Rafa Cabrera Bello almost aced the second hole en route to the early lead in the first round at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Florida on Thursday.

After a bogey at the first, Cabrera Bello bounced back with a perfectly-judged three-iron at the 215-yard second hole, where his ball landed on the front of the green and curled deliciously with the slope before to settle barely a foot away.

The tap-in birdie lifted his spirits and helped the Spaniard to a seven-under-par 65 at Bay Hill in Orlando.

“I had come off a bogey at one, so wasn’t really happy on the (second) tee,” Cabrera Bello told Golf Channel after opening a two-shot lead over American Keegan Bradley with half the field back in the clubhouse.

“I hit it exactly how I wanted. I knew it was a good shot … and then I looked up and see it a foot away.”

On a morning that started cool, former U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell carded 68 and world number two Justin Rose plodded to a 71.

Former world number one Jason Day lasted less than seven holes before withdrawing due to back problems.

World number 34 Cabrera Bello is seeking his first victory on the PGA Tour, though he has won three times on the European Tour.

“Normally irons tend to be one of my strengths. Today I hit many good shots,” he said.

“Sometimes you need a little extra luck, because there’s not a big difference between hitting a great shot to 12 feet or two feet and today the coin fell my side.”

Starting his round at the 10th hole, he surged to four-under after six holes, at which stage he had to remind himself not to get too carried away.

“I got off to a good start but it’s so early, and so many things can go wrong, you just stay in the moment and try not to think about the score,” he said.

Rose, meanwhile, was not too displeased with his performance in his first round after a month off.

“It’s not a bad round,” said the Englishman.

“Bay Hill played quite tricky this morning, quite cool starting out and just enough breeze to make every shot challenging.”",mainstream

 thing battering the big top tent erected at the foot of a hillside park in the

Most unnerving of all, though, is the inch-deep stream of water that runs off

 

 the hill and straight through this temporary venue. The organisers of the

 

 inaugural three-day Numero Festival of all things multimedia and electronic – the first of this nature in the Portuguese capital – had anticipated a kind of structured chaos to proceedings, but no-one assumed we’d require wellies for an indoor event.

It was only a matter of time before Lisbon hosted a festival celebrating the more interesting aspects of contemporary culture. Already every style-conscious budget Euro traveller’s destination of choice, thanks partly to the attention attracted by plush seafront nightclub the Lux, co-owned by one John Malkovich, its status as the new, ahem, Berlin has not been harmed by this government-funded arts weekender.

And where there’s a cool cosmopolitan party, there’s bound to be Chicks On Speed. Minor European techno-fashion celebrities sporting bespoke black binliners, the girls’ lo-fi cyber-Madonna spectacle always amuses, occasioning you to wonder how they get away with it. Coventry’s sonic extremist Russel Haswellspins Chris Morris’ ‘The Gush’ sketch in its entirety to a few hundred bewildered Lisbonites, then pummels heads with the darkest death metal and harshest techno.

 face bathed in the screen’s luminosity, spends an hour reprocessing and dissecting vintage hip-hop, splicing glitch after click into tracks by Detroit Grand Pubahs and NWA.

As thrilling as the Kid’s set is, it sounds prehistoric compared to the music loaded onto Richard James’ hard-drive. Aphex may have the same records as everyone else – old skool hip-hop, early jungle, deviant rave – but the ways in which he plays them, his ability to forge new from old, never ceases to amaze.

396,"anti-Semites because they transform a legitimate political and economic grievance into a racial one that easily can be dismissed as ""hatred.""

Racists ensure that Jews conform to the bankers' agenda and non-Jews remain divided.

One of their favorite anti-Semites is Edgar Steele, a lawyer and racist activist whose ""nickel rants"" appear on his web site Conspiracypenpal.com

Steele portrays himself and his followers as ordinary Americans concerned about their children, jobs and country. This is true. America has been subverted and much of Steele's criticism is sound and courageous.

But instead of correctly identifying the culprit, he leads his followers into a dead end: a racist animosity against all Jews and Blacks.

In a speech at ""Aryanfest 2005"" in August, he blamed all Jews for the Iraq War, not just Zionists like Paul Wolfowitz, for two reasons:

I phoned my son, 18, with this alarming information. Had he ever stolen or cheated anyone in his life?

Of course, he hadn't. I knew it but wanted his reaction. He is a good human being. He doesn't lie either.

Edgar, racism cuts both ways. What are you saying about your own children? Are they genetically so naïve as to be always duped? Are you (and your followers) congenitally doomed to be deceived and disinherited? I don't think so.

But it gets worse. Commenting on New Orleans, he says: ""Blacks simply are far more prone to lawlessness in general and violence in particular, than are Whites. It is genetic and cultural after all...I wouldn't even be surprised to read reports of cannibalism before this is all over, just as has been recurring in parts of Africa. Remember, it's genetic.""

Suddenly rational ""ordinary"" Americans concerned about their children, jobs and country have been transformed into an crazed angry mob easily discredited and defeated.

Edgar, what kind of lawyer destroys his own strong case? What kind of leader leads his people into a cul-de-sac?

New Orleans was a dress rehearsal for martial law. There are reports that Black evacuees are being held in concentration camps which are being prepared for the likes of Edgar and me.

The New World Orderlies keep testing to see how much repression America will take without reacting. They want to keep Whites, Blacks, Latinos and Jews at each other's throat and to portray anti-globalism as anti-Semitism. It's called divide-and-conquer and people like Edgar Steele inadvertently serve their purpose.



 Racism is irrelevant to the real problem. It's like a thief surrounded by police who shouts, ""I'm Polish."" The police round up every Slav in the vicinity and the thief escapes.

People must be judged by their own deeds. All human beings are endowed with freedom to do good or evil. People who do right should not be condemned because others of the same race do wrong. How would Edgar Steele like to be blamed for what his racial brethren, strangers, did?

In a 2003 article, ""It Ain't Arabs"" Steele gives about 60 reasons for hating Jews. Some relate to his personal experience. But 90% result from the actions of Jews (including Zionists) who were/are manipulated and empowered by the London banking cartel. They do not apply to many North American Jews who like myself are opposed to Zionism in its current form and alienated from mainstream Judaism. ""Whites"" aren't all identical; Jews are at least as diverse.

America's problems can all be traced to the fact that its finances are controlled by a London-based banking cartel led by the Rothschilds. The New World Order is designed to translate their monopoly of credit (they create our money from nothing as a debt to them) into world institutions of political control.

As I have said, they direct society through their sponsor-ownership and control of most politicians, parties, cartels, business councils, professional associations, unions, think tanks, foundations, university endowments, mass media, intelligence agencies, secret societies and organized crime.

In other words, just about everyone who is a ""success"" in Western society is a witting or unwitting ally, pawn or accomplice of ""Jewish"" bankers and their massive fraud.

Bankers like J.P.Morgan, J.D. Rockefeller and Joseph Seligman were agents of this London banking cartel, as are many media moguls and Presidents today. 

 ""Bankers and politicians are only men of straw.... even though they occupy high places and appear to be authors of the plans which are carried out..."" according the Red Symphony disclosure.

Purge all Jews and nothing would change. The bankers have intermarried with the non-Jewish elite and their goals are the goals of British imperialism. More worrisome, they have adopted a Luciferian philosophy, hidden in Freemasonry, which threatens to doom the human race.

For example, most Zionist leaders were and are Freemasons. In the words of Rabbi Shaul Brach,"" The Zionist heretics who run the State are collaborators and agents of Satan himself."" The same could be said of George W. Bush who loves to flash the satanic horned-goat sign while pretending it refers to the Texas Longhorn football team. (He couldn't very well admit the truth.)

Edgar, the problem is a Luciferian conspiracy empowered by a credit monopoly. The only solution is to break up the cartels and put the power to create money in the hands of honest legislators, as the U.S. Constitution provides. 

 

 Edgar, instead of diverting your followers with racism, focus on the real source of their dilemma, the central bankers and their agents: the Rothschilds and Rockefellers, the Rockefeller Foundation and CFR, the Neo Cons, NGO's, AIPAC, the ADL, the ACLU, the mass media, the Republican and Democratic Parties, to name just a few.



 Jewish bankers love anti-Semites. ""Their anti-Semitism is indispensable in the management of our lesser brethren,"" said the Masonic banker who wrote ""The Protocols of the Elders of Zion."" (9-2) You cannot understand the world without studying this short bookwhich plots a dictatorship of the super rich.

Anti-Semites are like dogs who drive the Jewish sheep into the bankers' pen. In spite of this, some Jews are questioning the instrumental role Jews play in the creation of the New World Order.

Like Edgar Steele, Jews feel the wrath of the Anti Defamation League, a branch of the Masonic B'nai B'rith. Leland Lehrman, the scion of a prominent New York Jewish family, (his father was narrowly defeated by Mario Cuomo in 1982) recently lost his weekly radio show in Santa Fe when the ADL threatened his sponsors. The French government is prosecuting the publisher of Israel Shamir's brilliant ""Galilee Flowers"".

Historically, the first preference of most Jews has been to assimilate. This is still the case in the U.S. Read Lenni Brenner's article on Jewish Demographics. Fifty per cent of Jews intermarry. Three-quarters of their children intermarry. Four-fifth of Jews living common law are inter-racial. Less than 10% of Jewish youth have anything to do with the Jewish community. The reason for this is that Zionism currently is an embarrassment and mainstream Judaism has failed to provide a credible spiritual standard.



 Jewish bankers love anti-Semites because they transform opposition to the NWO into discredited racism. They ensure that Jews serve the NWO agenda and non-Jews remain divided.

The best qualities of Western Civilization are derived from Christianity: the belief in personal salvation, Divine Love and universal brotherhood. I would urge white racists not to turn their backs on their vital heritage.

 

 Jews, Blacks, Whites, Latinos, all the serfs in the Neo Feudal World Order have much more in common than differences. We are all drawn from the same spectrum of human qualities, and are all capable of its highest and lowest shades. Everyone has something positive to contribute.

We must unite as brothers to combat the real enemy: a satanic cult empowered by a banking monopoly that pervades every aspect of Western society and culture.

149,"The above quotations come from a collection of 9/11 oral histories that, although recorded by the Fire Department of New York (FDNY) at the end of 2001, were publicly released only on August 12, 2005. Prior to that date, very few Americans knew the content of these accounts or even the fact that they existed.

Why have we not known about them until recently? Part of the answer is that the city of New York would not release them until it was forced to do so. Early in 2002, the New York Times requested copies under the freedom of information act, but Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s administration refused. So the Times, joined by several families of 9/11 victims, filed suit. After a long process, the city was finally ordered by the New York Court of Appeals to release the records (with some exceptions and redactions allowed). Included were oral histories, in interview form, provided by 503 firefighters and medical workers.1 (Emergency Medical Services had become a division within the Fire Department.2) The Times then made these oral histories publicly available.3

Once the content of these testimonies is examined, it is easy to see why persons concerned to protect the official story about 9/11 would try to keep them hidden. By suggesting that explosions were occurring in the World Trade Center’s Twin Towers, they pose a challenge to the official account of 9/11, according to which the towers were caused to collapse solely by the impact of the airplanes and the resulting fires.

In any case, now that the oral histories have finally been released, it is time for Americans and the world in general to see what these brave men and women reported about that fateful day. If this information forces a reevaluation of the official story about 9/11, better now than later.

That said, it must be added that although these oral histories are of great significance, they do not contain the first reports of explosions in the Twin Towers. Such reports–from firefighters, reporters, and people who had worked in the towers—started becoming available right after 9/11.

These reports, however, were not widely publicized by the mainstream press and, as a result, have for the most part been known only within the “9/11 truth movement,” which has focused on evidence that seems inconsistent with the official story.

I will begin by summarizing some of those previously available reports. Readers will then be able to see that although in some respects the newly released oral histories simply add reinforcement, they also are revelatory documents: Some of the testimonies are quite stunning, even to people familiar with the earlier reports; and there are now so many testimonies that even the most skeptical reader is likely to find the cumulative effect impressive.

Previously Available Testimony Suggestive of Explosions in the Twin Towers

The day after 9/11, a story in the Los Angeles Times, referring to the south tower, said: “There were reports of an explosion right before the tower fell, then a strange sucking sound, and finally the sound of floors collapsing.”4

A story in the Guardian said that “police and fire officials were carrying out the first wave of evacuations when the first of the World Trade Centre towers collapsed. Some eyewitnesses reported hearing another explosion just before the structure crumbled. Police said that it looked almost like a ‘planned implosion.'”5

“Planned implosion” is another term for controlled demolition, in which explosives are placed at crucial places throughout a building so that, when set off in the proper order, they will cause the building to come down in the desired way. When it is close to other buildings, the desired way will be straight down into, or at least close to, the buildings footprint, so that it does not damage the surrounding buildings. This type of controlled demolition is called an “implosion.” To induce an implosion in steel-frame buildings, the explosives must be set so as to break the steel columns. Each of the Twin Towers had 47 massive steel columns in its core and 236 steel columns around the periphery.

To return now to testimonies about explosions: There were many reports about an explosion in the basement of the north tower. For example, janitor William Rodriguez reported that he and others felt an explosion below the first sub-level office at 9 AM, after which co-worker Felipe David, who had been in front of a nearby freight elevator, came into the office with severe burns on his face and arms yelling “explosion! explosion! explosion!”6

Rodriguez’s account has been corroborated by Jose Sanchez, who was in the workshop on the fourth sub-level. Sanchez said that he and a co-worker heard a big blast that “sounded like a bomb,” after which “a huge ball of fire went through the freight elevator.”7

Engineer Mike Pecoraro, who was working in the sixth sub-basement of the north tower, said that after an explosion he and a co-worker went up to the C level, where there was a small machine shop. “There was nothing there but rubble,” said Pecoraro. “We’re talking about a 50 ton hydraulic press–gone!” They then went to the parking garage, but found that it was also gone. Then on the B level, they found that a steel-and-concrete fire door, which weighed about 300 pounds, was wrinkled up “like a piece of aluminum foil.” Having seen similar things after the terrorist attack in 1993, Pecoraro was convinced that a bomb had gone off.8

Given these testimonies to explosions in the basement levels of the towers, it is interesting that Mark Loizeaux, head of Controlled Demolition, Inc., has been quoted as saying: “If I were to bring the towers down, I would put explosives in the basement to get the weight of the building to help collapse the structure.”9

Some of the testimonies suggested that more than one explosion occurred in one tower or the other. FDNY Captain Dennis Tardio, speaking of the south tower, said: “I hear an explosion and I look up. It is as if the building is being imploded, from the top floor down, one after another, boom, boom, boom.”10

In June of 2002, NBC television played segments from tapes recorded on 9/11. One segment contained the following exchange, which involved firefighters in the south tower:

Firefighter Louie Cacchioli, after entering the north tower lobby and seeing elevator doors completely blown out and people being hit with debris, asked himself, “how could this be happening so quickly if a plane hit way above”? After he reached the 24th floor, he and another fireman “heard this huge explosion that sounded like a bomb [and] knocked off the lights and stalled the elevator.” After they pried themselves out of the elevator, “another huge explosion like the first one hits. This one hits about two minutes later . . . [and] I’m thinking, “Oh. My God, these bastards put bombs in here like they did in 1993!”12

Multiple explosions were also reported by Teresa Veliz, who worked for a software development company in the north tower. She was on the 47th floor, she reported, when suddenly “the whole building shook. . . . [Shortly thereafter] the building shook again, this time even more violently.” Then, while Veliz was making her way downstairs and outside: “There were explosions going off everywhere. I was convinced that there were bombs planted all over the place and someone was sitting at a control panel pushing detonator buttons. . . . There was another explosion. And another. I didn’t know where to run.”13

Steve Evans, a New York-based correspondent for the BBC, said: “I was at the base of the second tower . . . that was hit. . . . There was an explosion. . . . The base of the building shook. . . . [T]hen there was a series of explosions.”14

Sue Keane, an officer in the New Jersey Fire Police Department who was previously a sergeant in the U.S. Army, said in her account of the onset of the collapse of the south tower: “[I]t sounded like bombs going off. That’s when the explosions happened. . . . I knew something was going to happen. . . . It started to get dark, then all of a sudden there was this massive explosion.” Then, discussing her experiences during the collapse of the north tower, she said: “[There was] another explosion. That sent me and the two firefighters down the stairs. . . . I can’t tell you how many times I got banged around. Each one of those explosions picked me up and threw me. . . . There was another explosion, and I got thrown with two firefighters out onto the street.”15

Wall Street Journal reporter John Bussey, describing his observation of the collapse of the south tower from the ninth floor of the WSJ office building, said: “I . . . looked up out of the office window to see what seemed like perfectly synchronized explosions coming from each floor. . . . One after the other, from top to bottom, with a fraction of a second between, the floors blew to pieces.”16

Another Wall Street Journal reporter said that after seeing what appeared to be “individual floors, one after the other exploding outward,” he thought: “‘My God, they’re going to bring the building down.’ And they, whoever they are, HAD SET CHARGES. . . . I saw the explosions.”17

A similar perception was reported by Beth Fertig of WNYC Radio, who said: “It just descended like a timed explosion–like when they are deliberately bringing a building down. . . . It was coming down so perfectly that in one part of my brain I was thinking, ‘They got everyone out, and they’re bringing the building down because they have to.'”18

A more graphic testimony to this perception was provided on the film made by the Naudet brothers. In a clip from that film, one can watch two firemen describing their experiences to other firemen.

As these illustrations show, quite impressive testimony to the occurrence of explosions in the Twin Towers existed even prior to the release of the oral histories. As we will see, however, these oral histories have made the testimony much more impressive, qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The cumulative testimony now points even more clearly than before not simply to explosions but to controlled demolition.

Testimonies in the Oral Histories Suggestive of Controlled Demolition

Several FDNY members reported that they heard an explosion just before the south tower collapsed. For example, Battalion Chief John Sudnik said that while he and others were working at the command post, “we heard a loud explosion or what sounded like a loud explosion and looked up and I saw tower two start coming down.”20

Firefighter Timothy Julian said: “First I thought it was an explosion. I thought maybe there was a bomb on the plane, but delayed type of thing, you know secondary device. . . . I just heard like an explosion and then a cracking type of noise, and then it sounded like a freight train, rumbling and picking up speed, and I remember I looked up, and I saw it coming down.”21

Emergency medical technician Michael Ober said: “[W]e heard a rumble, some twisting metal, we looked up in the air, and . . . it looked to me just like an explosion. It didn’t look like the building was coming down, it looked like just one floor had blown completely outside of it. . . . I didn’t think they were coming down. I just froze and stood there looking at it.”22 Ober’s testimony suggests that he heard and saw the explosion before he saw any sign that the building was coming down.

This point is made even more clearly by Chief Frank Cruthers, who said: “There was what appeared to be at first an explosion. It appeared at the very top, simultaneously from all four sides, materials shot out horizontally. And then there seemed to be a momentary delay before you could see the beginning of the collapse.”23

These statements by Ober and Cruthers, indicating that there was a delay between the explosion and the beginning of the collapse, suggest that the sounds and the horizontal ejection of materials could not be attributed simply to the onset of the collapse.

As we saw earlier, some people in the towers reported that there were powerful explosions in the basements. Such explosions would likely have caused the ground to shake. Such shaking was reported by medical technician Lonnie Penn, who said that just before the collapse of the south tower: “I felt the ground shake, I turned around and ran for my life. I made it as far as the Financial Center when the collapse happened.”24

According to the official account, the vibrations that people felt were produced by material from the collapsing towers hitting the ground. Penn’s account, however, indicates that the shaking must have occurred several seconds before the collapse.

Shaking prior to the collapse of the north tower was described by fire patrolman Paul Curran. He was standing near it, he said, when “all of a sudden the ground just started shaking. It felt like a train was running under my feet. . . . The next thing we know, we look up and the tower is collapsing.”25

Lieutenant Bradley Mann of the fire department, one of the people to witness both collapses, described shaking prior to each of them. “Shortly before the first tower came down,” he said, “I remember feeling the ground shaking. I heard a terrible noise, and then debris just started flying everywhere. People started running.” Then, after they had returned to the area, he said, “we basically had the same thing: The ground shook again, and we heard another terrible noise and the next thing we knew the second tower was coming down.”26

The oral histories contain numerous testimonies with reports of more than one explosion. Paramedic Kevin Darnowski, for example, said: “I started walking back up towards Vesey Street. I heard three explosions, and then we heard like groaning and grinding, and tower two started to come down.”27

Gregg Brady, an emergency medical technician, reported the same thing about the north tower, saying: “I heard 3 loud explosions. I look up and the north tower is coming down now.”28

Somewhat more explosions were reported by firefighter Thomas Turilli, who said, referring to the south tower, that “it almost sounded like bombs going off, like boom, boom, boom, like seven or eight.”29

Even more explosions were reported by Craig Carlsen, who said that while he and other firefighters were looking up at the towers, they “heard explosions coming from building two, the south tower. It seemed like it took forever, but there were about ten explosions. . . . We then realized the building started to come down.”30

As before, “pops” were reported by some witnesses. “As we are looking up at the [south tower],” said firefighter Joseph Meola, “it looked like the building was blowing out on all four sides. We actually heard the pops. Didn’t realize it was the falling–you know, you heard the pops of the building. You thought it was just blowing out.”31

“Pops” were also reported by paramedic Daniel Rivera in the following exchange:

Collapse Beginning below the Strike Zone and Fire

According to the official account, the “pancaking” of the floors began when the floors above the strike zone, where the supports were weakened by the impact of the airplanes and the resulting fires, fell on the floors below. Some witnesses reported, however, that the collapse of the south tower began lower than the floors that were struck by the airliner and hence lower than the fires.

Timothy Burke reported that while he was watching flames coming out of the south tower, “the building popped, lower than the fire.” He later heard a rumor that “the aviation fuel fell into the pit, and whatever floor it fell on heated up really bad, and that’s why it popped at that floor.” At the time, however, he said, “I was going oh, my god, there is a secondary device because the way the building popped. I thought it was an explosion.”33

This same twofold observation was made by firefighter Edward Cachia, who said: “As my officer and I were looking at the south tower, it just gave. It actually gave at a lower floor, not the floor where the plane hit. . . . [W]e originally had thought there was like an internal detonation, explosives, because it went in succession, boom, boom, boom, boom, and then the tower came down.”34

Some witnesses reported other phenomena, beyond explosions, suggestive of controlled demolition.

The Appearance of Implosion: When a building close to other buildings is brought down by controlled demolition, as mentioned earlier, it typically implodes and hence comes straight down into, or at least close to, its own footprint, so that it does not fall over on surrounding structures.

As we saw above in the accounts that were previously available, both police and fire officials were quoted as saying that the towers seemed to implode. This perception was also stated in the oral history of Lieutenant James Walsh, who said: “The [north tower] didn’t fall the way you would think tall buildings would fall. Pretty much it looked like it imploded on itself.”35

Flashes: Another common feature of controlled demolitions is that people who are properly situated may see flashes when the explosives go off. Assistant Commissioner Stephen Gregory said: “I thought . . . before . . . No. 2 came down, that I saw low-level flashes. . . . Lieutenant Evangelista . . . asked me if I saw low-level flashes in front of the building, and I agreed with him because I . . . saw a flash flash flash . . . [at] the lower level of the building. You know like when they demolish a building, how when they blow up a building, when it falls down? That’s what I thought I saw.”36

Flashes were reported in the north tower by Captain Karin Deshore, who said: “Somewhere around the middle of the World Trade Center, there was this orange and red flash coming out. Initially it was just one flash.”37

Demolition Rings: At this point, Deshore’s account moved to another standard phenomenon seen by those who watch controlled demolitions: explosion rings, in which a series of explosions runs rapidly around a building. Deshore’s next words were: “Then this flash just kept popping all the way around the building and that building had started to explode. The popping sound, and with each popping sound it was initially an orange and then a red flash came out of the building and then it would just go all around the building on both sides as far as I could see. These popping sounds and the explosions were getting bigger, going both up and down and then all around the building.”38

An explosion ring (or belt) was also described by firefighter Richard Banaciski. Speaking of the south tower, he said: “[T]here was just an explosion. It seemed like on television [when] they blow up these buildings. It seemed like it was going all the way around like a belt, all these explosions.”39

A description of what appeared to be a ring of explosions was also given by Deputy Commissioner Thomas Fitzpatrick, who said: “We looked up at the [south tower] . . . . All we saw was a puff of smoke coming from about 2 thirds of the way up . . . . It looked like sparkling around one specific layer of the building. . . . My initial reaction was that this was exactly the way it looks when they show you those implosions on TV.”40

Horizontal Ejections: Another feature of controlled demolition, at least when quite powerful explosives are used, is that things are ejected horizontally from the floors on which the explosions occur. Such ejections were mentioned in the testimony of Chief Frank Cruthers above. Similarly, Captain Jay Swithers said: “I took a quick glance at the building and while I didn’t see it falling, I saw a large section of it blasting out, which led me to believe it was just an explosion.”41

Firefighter James Curran said: “When I got underneath the north bridge I looked back and . . . I heard like every floor went chu-chu-chu. Looked back and from the pressure everything was getting blown out of the floors before it actually collapsed.”42

Battalion Chief Brian Dixon said: “I was . . . hearing a noise and looking up. . . . [T]he lowest floor of fire in the south tower actually looked like someone had planted explosives around it because . . . everything blew out on the one floor. I thought, geez, this looks like an explosion up there, it blew out.”43

These reports by Curran and Dixon conform to what can be seen by looking at photographs and videos of the collapses, which show that various materials, including sections of steel and aluminum, were blown out hundreds of feet.44 Such powerful ejections of materials are exactly what would be expected from explosions powerful enough to cause such huge buildings to collapse.

Dust Clouds: The most visible material ejected horizontally from buildings during controlled demolition, especially buildings with lots of concrete, is dust, which forms more or less expansive dust clouds. Some of the testimonies about the collapse of the south tower mention that it produced an enormous amount of dust, which formed clouds so big and thick that they blocked out all light.

Firefighter Stephen Viola said: “You heard like loud booms . . . and then we got covered with rubble and dust, and I thought we’d actually fallen through the floor . . . because it was so dark you couldn’t see anything.”45

Firefighter Angel Rivera said: “That’s when hell came down. It was like a huge, enormous explosion. . . . The wind rushed. . . , all the dust. . . and everything went dark.”46

Lieutenant William Wall said: “[W]e heard an explosion. We looked up and the building was coming down right on top of us. . . . We ran a little bit and then we were overtaken by the cloud.”47

Paramedic Louis Cook said that after the debris started falling, “everything went black” and “you couldn’t breathe because [of] all the dust. There was just an incredible amount of dust and smoke.” He then found that there was, “without exaggerating, a foot and a half of dust on [his] car.”48

The kind of dust clouds typically produced during a controlled demolition can be seen on videos of the demolition of Seattle’s Kingdome and the Reading Grain Facility.49 If these videos are then compared with photos and videos of the collapses of the Twin Towers,50 it can be seen that the dust clouds in the latter are even bigger.51

Timed or Synchronized Explosions: Some people said that the collapses had the appearance of timed, synchronized demolitions. Battalion Chief Dominick DeRubbio, speaking of the collapse of the south tower, said: “It was weird how it started to come down. It looked like it was a timed explosion.”52

Firefighter Kenneth Rogers said: “[T]here was an explosion in the south tower. . . . I kept watching. Floor after floor after floor. One floor under another after another and when it hit about the fifth floor, I figured it was a bomb, because it looked like a synchronized deliberate kind of thing. I was there in ’93.”53

Given so many signs that the buildings had been brought down by controlled demolition, we might expect that debates about this issue would have taken place. And they did.

Firefighter Christopher Fenyo, after describing events that occurred after the first collapse, said: “At that point, a debate began to rage because. . . many people had felt that possibly explosives had taken out 2 World Trade, and officers were gathering companies together and the officers were debating whether or not to go immediately back in or to see what was going to happen with 1 World Trade at that point. The debate ended pretty quickly because 1 World Trade came down.”54

Firefighter William Reynolds reported on a conversation he had with a battalion chief: “I said, ‘Chief, they’re evacuating the other building; right'” He said, ‘No.’ . . . I said, ‘Why not’ They blew up the other one.’ I thought they blew it up with a bomb. I said, ‘If they blew up the one, you know they’re gonna blow up the other one.’ He said, ‘No, they’re not.’ I said, ‘Well, you gotta tell them to evacuate it, because it’s gonna fall down and you gotta get the guys out.’ . . . He said, ‘I’m just the Battalion Chief. I can’t order that.’ . . . I said, ‘You got a fucking radio and you got a fucking mouth. Use the fucking things. Empty this fucking building.’ Again he said, ‘I’m just a Battalion Chief. I can’t do that.’ . . . Eventually this other chief came back and said, ‘They are evacuating this tower.’ . . . And sometime after that . . . I watched the north tower fall.”55

As both accounts suggest, the perception that the south tower had been brought down by explosives may have resulted in fewer lives being lost in the north tower collapse than would otherwise have been the case.

Why Testimony about Explosions Has Not Become Public Knowledge

If so many witnesses reported effects that seemed to be produced by explosives, with some of them explicitly saying that the collapses appeared to be cases of controlled demolition, why is this testimony not public knowledge? Part of the answer, as I mentioned at the outset, is that the city of New York refused to release it until forced to do so by the highest court of the state of New York

But why did we have to wait for this court-ordered release to learn about these testimonies? Should not they have been discussed in The 9/11 Commission Report, which was issued over a year earlier? This Report, we are told in the preface, sought “to provide the fullest possible account of the events surrounding 9/11.” Why does it not include any of the testimony in the 9/11 oral histories suggestive of controlled demolition?

The answer cannot be that the Commission did not know about these oral histories. Although “[t]he city also initially refused access to the records to investigators from . . . the 9/11 Commission,” Jim Dwyer of the New York Times tells us, it “relented when legal action was threatened.”56 So the Commission could have discussed the testimonies about explosions in the oral histories. It also, in order to help educate the public, could have called some of the firefighters and medical workers to repeat their testimony during one of the Commission’s public hearings. But it did not.

Why, we may wonder, have the firefighters and medical workers not been speaking out? At least part of the reason may be suggested by a statement made by Auxiliary Lieutenant Fireman Paul Isaac. Having said that “there were definitely bombs in those buildings,” Isaac added that “many other firemen know there were bombs in the buildings, but they’re afraid for their jobs to admit it because the ‘higher-ups’ forbid discussion of this fact.”57

Would we not expect, however, that a few courageous members of the fire department would have contacted the 9/11 Commission to tell their story? Indeed. But telling their story to the Commission was no guarantee that it would find its way into the final report—as indicated by the account of one fireman who made the effort.

Firefighter Louie Cacchioli, who was quoted earlier, testified in 2004 to members of the Commission’s staff. But, he reported, they were so unreceptive that he ended up walking out in anger. “I felt like I was being put on trial in a court room,” said Cacchioli. “They were trying to twist my words and make the story fit only what they wanted to hear. All I wanted to do was tell the truth and when they wouldn’t let me do that, I walked out.”58

That Cacchioli’s experience was not atypical is suggested by janitor William Rodriguez, whose testimony was also quoted earlier. Although Rodriguez

was invited to the White House as a National Hero for his rescue efforts on 9/11, he was, he said, treated quite differently by the Commission: “I met with the 9/11 Commission behind closed doors and they essentially discounted everything I said regarding the use of explosives to bring down the north tower.”59

When reading The 9/11 Commission Report, one will not find the name of Cacchioli, or Rodriguez, or anyone else reporting explosions in the towers. It would appear that the Commission deliberately withheld this information, as it apparently did with regard to Able Danger60 and many other things that should have been included in “the fullest possible account of the events surrounding 9/11.”61

The definitive report about the collapse of the towers was to have been provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). According to Rodriguez, however, this investigative body was equally uninterested in his testimony: “I contacted NIST . . . four times without a response. Finally, [at a public hearing] I asked them before they came up with their conclusion . . . if they ever considered my statements or the statements of any of the other survivors who heard the explosions. They just stared at me with blank faces.”62

In light of this report of NIST’s response, it is not surprising to find that its final report, which in the course of supporting the official story about the collapses ignores many vital issues,63 makes no mention of reports of explosions and other phenomena suggestive of controlled demolition.

It is sometimes said that the mandate of an official commission is, by definition, to support the official story. Insofar as that is true, it is not surprising that neither NIST nor the 9/11 Commission saw fit to discuss testimony suggestive of explosions in the Twin Towers, since this testimony is in strong tension with the official story.

At least most of those who offered this testimony did not, to be sure, mean to challenge the most important element in the official story about 9/11, which is that the attacks were entirely the work of foreign terrorists. For example, firefighter Timothy Julian, after saying that he “thought it was an explosion,” added: “I thought maybe there was a bomb on the plane, but delayed type of thing, you know secondary device.”64 Assistant Commissioner James Drury said: “I thought the terrorists planted explosives somewhere in the building.”65

The problem, however, is that a bomb delivered by a plane, or even a few explosives planted “somewhere in the building,” would not explain the many phenomena suggestive of controlled demolition, such as explosion rings and other features indicating that the explosions were “synchronized” and otherwise “timed.” As Mark Loizeaux, the head of Controlled Demolition, Inc., has explained, “to bring [a building] down as we want, so no one or no other structure is harmed,” the demolition must be “completely planned.” One needs “the right explosive [and] the right pattern of laying the charges.”66

The 9/11 oral histories, therefore, create a difficult question for those who defend the official story: How could al-Qaeda terrorists have gotten access to the Twin Towers for all the hours required to place all the explosives needed to bring down buildings of that size? It is primarily because they force this question that the testimony about explosions in the towers is itself explosive.

Surprisingly, after explaining how precisely explosives must be set to ensure that a building comes straight down, Loizeaux said that upon seeing the fires in the Twin Towers, he knew that they were “going to pancake down, almost vertically.

741,"We live in an age of giants. That might sound strange, given the lack of enormous dinosaurs or giant ground sloths trundling around. But it’s true: The blue whale, Balaenoptera musculus, is the largest animal that has ever lived, stretching over 100 feet long and weighing about 100 tons. And this giant isn’t some holdover from an ancient epoch.

Today’s enormous whales are the result of a relatively recent evolutionary growth spurt.

It’s easy to take the vastness of many whales for granted, but from an evolutionary scientist’s perspective, the fact that they evolved to be so gargantuan seems fairly unlikely. Nicholas Pyenson, the curator of fossil marine mammals at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, has been tracking the long tail of whale evolution for decades, from deserts brimming with bones to the seas themselves.

Part of the story in his new book, Spying on Whales, is documenting how today’s ocean giants came to be as giant they are.

“Whales have a geologic history spanning over 50 million years,” Pyenson says, “but they really didn’t reach titanic sizes until the past few million years.” What we know of whales’ fossil backstory makes cetaceans over 200,000 pounds—like today’s blue, fin, bowhead, and right whales—relatively new. So how did this happen?

First of all, it’s not as if just one lineage of whale got big in a straightforward fashion. “We know from looking at the family tree of big whales that many different lineages reach extreme sizes independently,” Pyenson says. But there’s a pattern in when these various whales got supersized. Extremely large whales evolved in the last 4.5 million years, coinciding with the ebb and flow of the Ice Ages.

Ice Age conditions were a boon to filter-feeding whales, meaning that the advent of an Ice Age generally heralded a growth spurt. “The boost from nutrient run-off along the coasts make for hyperabundant prey in warmer seasons,” Pyenson says, “which is something we see today off Alaska, California or Maine.” This not only offered a smorgasbord for whales, but also gave whales a reason to migrate long distances to take advantage of the seasonal bounty. “Ice Age seas made big whales even bigger.”

Listen to this episode of Sidedoor, the Smithsonian podcast, that takes a deep dive into the once aggressively hunted and thought to be nearly extinct, gray whale. They've rebounded to become one of the North Pacific’s most abundant whale species. What changed?

And aside from the sea changes that occurred during the Pliocene and Pleistocene, the specifics of living in the marine realm allowed some whales reach sizes unheard of for land animals. “Fully aquatic animals live in a nearly neutrally buoyant environment,” Mont Sinai anatomist Joy Reidenberg says, “so their weight is irrelevant.” This is why a whale is far heavier than a dinosaur of the same size; Supersaurus, estimated at about the same length as the largest blue whale, weighed less than half as much. It’s also why beached whales quickly find themselves in danger: On land, a whale’s bulk damages their muscles and releases dangerous amounts of a protein called myoglobin that can cause their kidneys to fail.

Still, this doesn’t mean that, anatomically, anything goes in the ocean. “You might imagine that whales could simply evolve larger and larger sizes unconstrained,” Pyenson says, “but there are a lot of fact of their lives that do pose biological limits.”

Early on, Reidenberg says, the amphibious mammals that preceded today’s whales spent their time between the shore and shallow water. They needed dense bones to act as ballast to help keep them neutrally buoyant and also support themselves while on shore leave.

As whales became more aquatic and attained huge sizes, though, the pattern reversed. Modern whales, Reidenberg says, “have porous bones that, combined with fat deposits, make them lighter.” This helps whales stay at the surface and breathe air, and, Reidenberg points out, the balance of heavy and light organs inside whales allows them to change how buoyant they are by expanding or contracting air spaces in organs like the lungs and larynx. When whales blow air (and snot) out of their blowholes, they’re controlling their buoyancy.

These recent, extreme adaptations raise a question of how cetaceans may continue to change. With the largest whale of all time still swimming the seas today, could giant whales get even bigger still?

While it’s tantalizing to think of even larger leviathans, there are a few things that prevent whales from being more massive. Whales breathe air, just as their amphibious ancestors did back in the Eocene, making their lungs critical hardware for animals that have to deal with vast differences in ocean pressure. But there are limits to how efficiently respiratory systems can provide sufficient oxygen to larger and larger bodies, Pyenson notes, “and that may be one reason that there aren’t, say, 300-foot-long whales in the oceans today.”

The physics of aquatic life comes into play, too. Whales have streamlined bodies to help reduce drag (the force that resists a whale’s motion through the water) but there’s no way to eliminate it entirely. And the feeding methods of the largest whales—gulping huge mouthfuls of small morsels out of the water—only works if whales are able to overcome this problem as they literally drag their jaws through the water.

A 2012 study of this feeding behavior found that, beyond lengths of 110 feet, baleen whales wouldn’t be able to overcome the drag to close their mouths fast enough to capture fleeing prey. “The largest whales ever measured, at 109 feet, are pushing the theoretical limit of the largest gulp-feeding whales that can exist.” In other words, whales probably won’t be able to get much larger without an overhaul of the way the largest species feed.

Human history has played a role, too. “Industrial whaling added another selective pressure to whale populations,” Reidenberg says. He adds both modern and historic whalers have regularly targeted the largest whales they could find, meaning that “smaller whales that could reproduce at a smaller size were artificially selected [for].” Hunting whales may have shrunken the whale populations that managed to survive, and, for slow-reproducing species, even limited whaling can still have dramatic effects.

What the future holds for whales, then—as with so much of our planet—depends very much on our how our species decides to act.

Life on Earth is facing a major extinction crisis, and, Pyenson points out, research on extinction risk factors in mammals often points to large body size as a liability. This is as true for whales as for elephants and long-lost species like wombats the size of small cars. The North Atlantic right whale, for example, reaches over 50 feet in length and is one of the most endangered cetaceans on the planet.

How this will play out for other whales is uncertain, but Pyenson notes that there are plenty of risks beyond whaling. “Hundreds of thousands die from net entanglements, fisheries by-catch, poisoning from pollution, or by ship-strike,” Pyenson says, which is not to mention the obscene levels of microplastic pollution in the oceans. How the massive amount of plastic garbage affects the health of filter-feeding whales is unknown, Pyenson says, and that’s worrying as researchers try to beat extinction.

Some giants have managed to bounce back, such as humpbacks and West Coast gray whales. But the threats many cetaceans face—from the tiny, highly-imperiled vaquita to the blue whale itself—require that researchers dig through petrified boneyards as well as sift the seas to better understand how to save cetaceans in unstable oceans. Fossils have shown when whales got big, and biology has revealed how they’ve set the upper limit for animal size, but the fantastic whales of future seas will only exist if we make an effort to save them now.",mainstream

247,"The theory that birds descended from bipedal dinosaurs, Coelurosaurs to be exact, is now well-established within the palaeontological community. With that one out of the way, bird palaeontologists can focus on more pressing issues, such as the origin and evolution of Neornithes, the group of birds that comprises all living birds. Several groups of extinct birds are known to have existed alongside the dinosaurs, such as the aquatic diving birds Hesperornithiformes, the large, toothed Ichthyornithiformes, and the “opposite birds” Enanthiornithidae, named after the distinct anatomy of their shoulder girdle. None of them gave rise to the birds we see in our backyard today.

The early evolution of modern birds is fuzzy, to say the least. Models based on molecular clocks place the origin of Neornithes as far back as the Early Cretaceous, whereas others suggest that modern birds did not diversify until the Late Cretaceous (see Brocklehurst et al., 2012 for a discussion). The sparse fossil record of Mesozoic Neornithes does little to clear things up.

Modern birds can be split into two major groups; the Palaeognaths (meaning “old jaws”) include the flightless ostriches and kiwis, whereas the Neognaths (“new jaws) contains all other birds. The earliest group of birds to split off within the Neognaths was that of the Galloanserae, the group containing the Anseriformes (ducks and allies) and the Galliformes (pheasants, grouse and allies). The earliest Neognath may be the galliform Austinornis lentus, dated to about 85 million years ago (Clarke, 2004), although some doubt about its presumed identity as a galliform remains. The description of Vegavis iaai as a Late Cretaceous (68-66 million years) member of the duck lineage suggests that Neognaths had already split into modern groups before the end of the Mesozoic era. However, whether the radiation of the remaining Neognaths occurred before or after the Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction remains a topic of discussion.

This is why bird paleontologists are looking with great interests at the period beyond the Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction, because this is where the ancestors of all our modern birds are to be found.

A recent paper by a team of bird paleontologists from the Canterbury Museum in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt, Germany, describes a penguin fossil foot from the mid-Paleocene Waipara Greensand location in New Zealand. This locality is dated to about 61 million years ago. The fossil foot belongs to a new species of penguin. The specimens were found at the same locality where another species of large penguin was found as well, Waimanu manneringi (Slack et al. 2006), which is considered the oldest penguin known to date.

Tarsometatarsi vary tremendously from one group of birds to another, and are therefore a very useful bone to identify birds. In penguins, the tarsometatarsi is very distinct; it is extremely short and broad, as if someone took a heron’s tarsometatarsus, cut out the long bit in the middle and glued the top and bottom together again. But even within penguins, the shape of the tarsometatarsus varies. The new fossil foot differs from Waimanu, and looks more like modern penguins, in its proportions and the shape of the hypotarsal canals, a set of ridges on the plantar side of the bone that keep the tendons for the foot in place during locomotion.

The finding of this new fossil penguin foot alongside more primitive species of penguins indicates that penguin diversity early after the Cretaceous - Palaeogene extinction event was larger than expected. Moreover, the penguin foot shows characteristics that we are used to seeing in much younger penguins. This shows that the typical penguin tarsometatarsus morphology evolved more rapidly than we thought. The difference in tarsometatarsus morphology between the new specimen and Waimanu likely reflects differences in locomotion both in the water and on land.

The new tarsometatarsus is much stouter than Waimanu and corresponds with small individuals of Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi, a species of giant penguin that lived 45-33 million years ago and could reach 165 cm in length. Thus, early penguins not only looked like modern penguins, they also attained very large sizes early on in their evolution, and kept it up for almost 30 million years. Why giant penguins disappeared around 20 million years ago remains unclear. Their disappearance roughly coincides with a rise in marine mammals, particularly the evolution of toothed whales (Odontoceti). Competition for food may have been a contributing factor in their demise (Ando and Fordyce 2014).

This unexpected diversity of penguins so soon after the end of the Cretaceous has bearing on hypotheses regarding the early evolution of Neornithes. A number of molecular analyses suggested that different penguin groups started to develop around 62 million years ago (Jarvis et al. 2014; Prum et al. 2015). However, according to this hypothesis, the presence of both primitive and more evolved types of penguins, as shown by the material from New Zealand suggests that early penguins evolved in an extremely short time period. A much more likely scenario would be that penguins started to diversify in the Late Cretaceous, well before the mass extinction event. Why penguins survived, and Tyrannosaurus rex did not, one can only wonder.

The syndrome typically involves malformation or absence of the central rays of the feet and is characterized by deformities like median deep clefts of distal extremities. Routine examination of feet during second-trimester ultrasound (US) may increase the detection rates of foot malformations.

383,"Although it might the worst idea for a children’s book in world history, A Children’s Book of Demons exists. It is published, widely distributed and it is sold on Amazon, at Walmart and some of the largest book stores in the country. Here’s the summary of the book by author Aaron Leighton:

A review of the book says:

A Children’s Book of Demons is basically a grimoire (a manual of witchcraft to invoke demons and the spirit of the dead) for children. It contains 72 demons that can be conjured by children for their personal benefit (which is the definition of black magic). Each demon is accompanied by a sigil (a symbol representing a demon imbued with occult power) and a “cute” drawing (that is replete with occult symbolism).

There are several things worth noting here. First, the drawing of the demon is highly inspired by Baphomet, complete with the “as above, so below” hand sign.

Second, the name Corydon is not random. It is the name of a pedophile character in Virgil’s Eclogues: A shepherd who’s in love with a young boy named Alexis.

The name’s association with “boy love” was cemented by the French author André Gide’s who titled his book defending homosexuality and pederasty (a sexual relationship between an adult man and a pubescent or adolescent boy) Corydon.

So, yeah, this is a strange name choice for a book intended for children aged 5-10.

Here are some other demons.

To summon these demons, children are encouraged to reproduce their sigils, which are very similar to actual sigils in the Goetia – the classic reference work for black magic.

The book was written by a Canadian artist named Aaron Leighton. Here’s his biography.

The author’s bio pic is rather odd.

If one can go past the annoying soyboy face, there’s other stuff going on in that pic. First, why is there a phallic object going into that cartoon’s mouth at the bottom right? Why is it crying? Finally, the author’s pose is rather reminiscent of a pic that is also highly symbolic. And, considering the fact that Leighton is a “fan of all things occult”, this might not be a coincidence.

A Children’s Book of Demons is yet another attempt at normalizing black magic and satanism to children. By catering to children’s wants and needs (chores, homework, etc.), the book over-simplifies the extremely dark and complex world of ceremonial magic and turns it into a fun game. However, any occultist will be keen to say: Black magic is not a game. And it is definitely not for children.

To truly understand black magic, one must read the words of actual occultists, not “witchcraft is fun” bloggers. Eliphas Levi (the guy who drew Baphomet) wrote in his classic Dogmes et Rituels de la Haute Magie:

The other prominent occultist and 33rd degree Freemason Manly P. Hall explains the high price of black magic.

True black magic is performed with the aid of a demoniacal spirit, who serves the sorcerer for the length of his earthly life, with the understanding that after death the magician shall become the servant of his own demon. For this reason a black magician will go to inconceivable ends to prolong his physical life, since there is nothing for him beyond the grave. The most dangerous form of black magic is the scientific perversion of occult power for the gratification of personal desire. Its less complex and more universal form is human selfishness, for selfishness is the fundamental cause of all worldly evil. A man will barter his eternal soul for temporal power, and down through the ages a mysterious process has been evolved which actually enables him to make this exchange.

 – Manly P. Hall, Secret Teachings of All Ages

In short, summoning demons is the very last thing children should be playing with. Even if the demons are made-up, the sigils could very well be charged with actual occult powers.

To those who believe that this is all bunk, remember this: Some of the most powerful, intelligent and influential people in world history believed in this stuff and studied it extensively. So, as I like to say, the fact that you are not aware of something doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.

1310,"Bigfoot Biomedical, Inc. is a medical technology startup headquartered with almost 130 employees as of 2019, in Milpitas, California.[1] It is founded by Jeffrey Brewer, Bryan Mazlish, and Lane Desborough.[2][3]

The company began in 2011 when founder Bryan Mazlish’s son was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Mazlish developed a control algorithm to drive the first automated artificial pancreas device for his wife and son.[4][5]

In late 2014, Mazlish joined with Brewer and Desborough to form Bigfoot Biomedical in order to scale and commercialize the technology.[5][6]

In January 2017, it was reported that Bigfoot Biomedical had received an investment from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF).[7]

In June 2017, the team from Patients Pending LTD, makers of the Timesulin smart insulin pen, joined Bigfoot Biomedical to lead the development of a smart pen solution for people utilizing multiple daily injections to manage their diabetes.[8]

In May 2015, Bigfoot acquired the assets of Asante Solutions, former manufacturer of the Snap insulin pump. In June 2015, Bigfoot announced a development agreement with Dexcom, securing the technology needed for the continuous glucose monitoring component of the system.[9]

In June 2017, Bigfoot acquired London-based startup Patients Pending, LTD to assist with the development of an insulin pen product.[10][11]

Bigfoot Biomedical’s first clinical trial[12] enrolled its first patients in 2016.[13][14] In December 2017, the company closed a Series B funding round and announced plans to begin clinical trials for an automated insulin delivery system in 2018.[11][15]",mainstream
916,"(Reuters) – Fulham captain Tom Cairney is expected to be out for several weeks after suffering a foot injury, manager Slavisa Jokanovic said on Thursday.

The 27-year-old midfielder, who has pulled out of international duty with Scotland, picked up the injury in Fulham’s Premier League win against Burnley last weekend and was taken off after 78 minutes.

“He (Cairney) has a foot injury and we still need to assess him but it is our expectation that he will be unavailable for a few weeks,” Jokanovic told reporters ahead of Saturday’s league trip to Brighton and Hove Albion.

“We must assess him, he is going to be out for a few weeks. Yes, this is a big loss for us.”

Fulham will also be without Neeskens Kebano when they travel to the Amex Stadium this weekend after the winger injured his ankle in Tuesday’s League Cup win over Exeter.

“Kebano has an ankle problem and he is probably going to be out for four weeks,” the manager added.

“I am not a doctor, but it has a similarity to Cairney but it is not the same thing.”

526,"Shanks & Bigfoot were a British duo of UK garage producers Steven Meade and Danny Langsman, known principally for their single ""Sweet Like Chocolate"", which topped the UK Singles Chart in 1999. They were originally known as Doolally, recording the pirate anthem ""Straight from the Heart"" under this name in 1998. Upon its first release, ""Straight from the Heart"" peaked at number twenty on the UK chart. It was subsequently re-released in 1999 on the back of their chart success with ""Sweet Like Chocolate"", and reached number nine on the chart.

The single ""Sweet Like Chocolate"" was a success even before commercial release, receiving months of club play before debuting at number one on the UK Singles Chart, where it remained for two weeks. Much to the surprise of the duo, the song became one of the most popular singles of the late 1990s. The single went on to become Britain's eighth-biggest selling single of 1999.

""We think it must have captured people's imaginations somehow"", said Shanks in an interview. ""I don't think you ever think 'this is a big record' when you make one... it was something that just happened."" Vocals on the track were sung by Sharon Woolf, who also sung ""Straight from the Heart"" for them the year before.

The video for ""Sweet Like Chocolate"" was computer-animated and popular at the time. It featured a girl walking along in an area where almost everything is made of chocolate. The video was created by Visualisation Services Ltd (Darren Lee) and was nominated for a BRIT and a MOBO in 1999, but failed to win on either occasion.

At the annual MOBO Awards in 1999, Shanks & Bigfoot received three nominations and won one, for Best British Dance Act, beating out Fatboy Slim, Armand van Helden and Phats & Small. Additionally, they were nominated for two Ivor Novello Awards and two BRITs. A bidding war for Shanks & Bigfoot soon resulted, with the duo eventually signing to Zomba Records. They were also in hot demand as songwriters, with Britney Spears asking them to write for her, as well as Beyoncé and Destiny's Child reporting in the now-defunct Ministry magazine, that they loved the record and had taken copies of ""Sweet Like Chocolate"" back to the US where it was never released. However, it would later show up in a compilation album that was released Stateside by Epic in 2001.[1]

In late 1999, the duo remixed Jamiroquai's song ""Canned Heat"" as a B-side for their ""King for a Day"" single.

In 2000, they released their debut and only album Swings and Roundabouts along with the follow-up single to ""Sweet Like Chocolate"", ""Sing-A-Long"", which failed to match the commercial success of ""Sweet Like Chocolate"", peaking at No. 12. English soul singer Terri Walker, an unknown at the time, provided vocals for all of the album except for ""Sweet Like Chocolate"". In the same year, they also mixed a Ministry of Sound compilation entitled Ayia Napa – The Album.

The post said: “My friend and I got permission to fly our drones at Salt Fork State Park in Ohio. “While we were there we heard many strange noises and we believe we may have found the Ohio Grassman/Bigfoot/Sasquatch.” “Ohio Grassman” is a local name for Bigfoot.

More than 10,000 people in the US have allegedly encountered Bigfoot over the past 50 years. One third of the sightings have taken place in the Pacific northwest of the US. There are even several organisations that are dedicated to the research and investigation of Bigfoot.",mainstream
988,"“There are these two trees that were at least 60-feet-tall and 10 feet apart from each other … snapped now about 15 to 20 feet off the ground … and the upper parts are laying in my driveway.”

The two, once 60-foot-tall trees, snapped off about 20 feet above the ground and found by John Nieuwenhuis in his front yard as he investigated around his Kalamazoo home at 8:30 AM, Monday, May 28, 2012, after a huge boom shook his 4,000-square-foot-house.

Updated: May 30, 2012 Kalamazoo, Michigan – Between 10:30 PM on Sunday night, May 27, 2012, and the next morning at 8:30 AM local time in four counties of southwestern Michigan, something highly strange caused booms loud enough to provoke residents to call police and fire departments.

The first round of booms on Sunday night, May 27, 2012, seemed to be focused in Union City, Michigan, about 50 miles southeast of Kalamazoo. Residents said it was like a huge clap of thunder in a clear, dry sky. Four counties altogether were affected: Calhoun, Branch, St. Joseph and Kalamazoo.

The four red circles mark the four counties affected by the loud boom sound, first at 10:30 PM on Sunday night, May 27, 2012. That one seemed focused on Union City in Calhoun County, based on number of phone calls to police, fire and 911. Then at 8:30 AM the next morning, Monday, May 28, 2012, about 50 miles west in southwestern Kalamazoo in Kalamazoo County, the explosive sound was focused on the home of John Nieuwenhuis and the two 60-foot-tall trees in his front yard.

The next morning at 8:30 AM going northwest from Union City in Calhoun County about fifty miles to the Kalamazoo neighborhood of John Nieuwenhuis in Kalamazoo County, another boom was so loud that it shook the 4,000-square-foot Nieuwenhuis house in the middle of a 17-acre forest. John Nieuwenhuis was born in Kalamazoo 63 years ago where he has lived all his life. He has worked for the Kalamazoo County Sheriff’s Department in the late 1970s and for the Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources and the Dept. of Environmental Quality where he helped manage cleanups and spills. He also owns Little John’s Excavating and Environmental Services in which he and his workers provide emergency services for Kalamazoo in addition to their excavation contracts.

John A. Nieuwenhuis (KNEE-wen-hice), Owner, Little John’s Excavating and Environmental Services, Kalamazoo, Michigan: “My house is fairly new, a 4,000 square foot home built very solidly for tornadoes and everything. You can’t hear anything outside because it’s very soundproofed. But what happened at 8:30 AM, I was looking outside the window and there wasn’t a leaf blowing anywhere. It was just dead quiet. My house is located on 17 acres of woods. I’m right in the middle of the woods. It was an unusual dead quiet.

Then all of a sudden, it was like years ago when there were supersonic booms from aircraft that broke windows in homes. This house just shook, which led me to believe there was an explosion inside, so I thought something blew up in my basement.

So I ran downstairs and nothing. So I went out in my backyard and saw nothing. Then when I went out my front door, I could not believe it. These big trees were down on my driveway. Being a first responder with Rescue, the first thing I thought of was a plane came down. I ran down the driveway on the other side of the trees expecting to find an aircraft, because whatever had happened just targeted two trees in the middle of the woods. But there was nothing there!

WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

There are these two trees that were at least 60-feet-tall and 10 feet apart from each other that sort of leaned like a tunnel over my driveway to the north. But these two trees are snapped now about 15 to 20 feet off the ground. They are completely snapped off and the upper parts are laying in my driveway facing west – both of them side-by-side.

WHAT WERE THE LENGTHS OF THE TREES IN YOUR DRIVEWAY?

15 to 20 feet of the tree stump was still standing and the remaining maybe 30 to 40 feet of each tree were lying in the driveway, snapped off cleanly.

Photograph taken on Monday, May 28, 2012, soon after the 8:30 AM thunderous boom that shook the 4,000 square foot house owned by John Nieuwenhuis in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The two approximately 60-foot trees were snapped off about 20 feet above the ground

 at the center of this photograph next to tall, completely untouched trees nearby.

In my company we do tree clearing and logging, so we have trees that land into other trees. We’ve experienced all that. I’ve never seen anything like this before! But at first, I figured it had to be a plane that came down and cut the trees off. However, the trees are not damaged on their tops – nothing was crushed or torn.

SO NO DAMAGE TO THE PORTION OF THE TWO TREES SNAPPED OFF IN YOUR DRIVEWAY?

Right, they are just lying there.

WHAT FORCE AT 20 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND COULD HAVE SNAPPED OFF THE TWO TREES SO EVENLY?

With other trees similar to those all the way around them. Whatever it was just singled out those two trees. And it took no leaves off any of the other trees! And there was just that dead quiet all that time and the sun was bright, not a cloud in the sky, and just the dead, dead quiet.

And I didn’t know anything about the booms the night before in towns west of me. I learned people heard loud explosions and also the houses were shaking when the TV news crew came to interview me later on Monday after I had called the local fire department only five minutes from my house to see if they heard anything. And my neighbor 300 yards away, her house shook also and she heard the explosion.

And the Fire Department is probably a half-mile from my home. And an explosion as loud as what I heard, they should have heard. If I shot off a shotgun at my house, there is no doubt that you could hear it at the fire station. I called Fire Rescue to ask if they heard of anything crashing into the woods. They said they didn’t have any reports and they did not hear anything. But they sent a car to my place and looked to find anything that could have hit those two trees. After searching, they said they could not find anything and were totally baffled about what could do the damage to those two trees in that manner.

HOW IS SUCH A LOUD PHENOMENON BEING ISOLATED TO ONE OR TWO HOUSES?

Right, and I’ll ask some more of my neighbors to see if anyone else heard anything.

ANY FRACKING IN YOUR AREA?

I don’t know of any and geologists here have confirmed there isn’t any. The deepest we usually dig around here is 20 feet where we put sewer and water lines in. It’s a soft sand, gravel clay soil around here on the top 18 inches, but once you get below that, it’s very soft sand and gravel type material. I don’t know what lies beneath that.

I UNDERSTAND THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF METEORS OR MILITARY AIRCRAFT BREAKING THE SOUND BARRIER?

That’s what the local news has reported – no answers to what happened at my house or in Union City the night before.”

March 2012 Booms in Clintonville, WI Were Northwest of Kalamazoo, Michigan



 Kalamazoo, Michigan (lower right circle) is about 300 miles southeast of Clintonville,

 Wisconsin (upper left circle) as the crow flies straight across Lake Michigan. Clintonville

 is where beginning on March 18, 2012, loud booms were heard intermittently over a

 two week period and were featured in national media as a mystery.

Beginning around 9:30 PM Central on Sunday evening, March 18, 2012, until 5:30 AM early Monday morning, people in northeastern Clintonville, Wisconsin, reported loud sounds that shook their homes and were compared to clanging metal, jackhammers and thunder. Some thought the vibrations were coming from underground. City Administrator Lisa Kuss said people reported that the shaking increased early Monday morning, March 19, 2012, at 1:45 AM and stayed loud until around 7:15 AM when the mysterious booming, clanging, house-rattling noises tapered off. But were not gone because they started all over again around 12:15 AM right after midnight on Tuesday, March 20.

2nd Night to Morning: Monday to Tuesday, March 19-20, 2012

 Strongest times were between 12:15 AM and 5:10 AM, Tuesday, March 20

Monday evening, March 19, Clintonville police, fire, emergency and utility crews checked manholes for gas leaks, gas and water lines for leaks, but nothing abnormal was found. However, the metallic clanging and house-rattling sounds started again a little after midnight early Tuesday morning, March 20, 2012. Police received nearly 100 phone calls between 12:15 AM and 5:10 AM, especially at 12:15 AM, 1:20 AM, 2:20 AM. and a few at 5:08AM. Dispatcher Karen Wegenke says residents were reporting loud booms that shook their houses.



 Beginning at 5:30 PM Central on Tuesday, March 20, 2012, in Montello, Wisconsin,

 about 80 miles southwest of Clintonville, residents called police about loud booms

 shaking their houses and rattling windows. University of Wisconsin-Madison Seismologist

 Harold Tobin said he was not aware of any seismic readings or reports near Montello.

On Tuesday at 5:30 PM, March 20, no one in Clintonville knew that 80 miles southwest in Montello, Wisconsin, that residents there also called police about a loud, window-rattling boom. “There was a loud boom and all the windows shook. The whole house shook, but no one has an explanation. I was thinking it was an explosion but we had no flames anywhere,” said Patti Lekas. One Montello resident compared the sound to a train wreck right where you are standing and all the cars slam into each other at once.

Montello Police Chief Richard Olson said, “We have a lot of good, reliable sources that reported this pretty much community wide. They reported it almost as if it was under ground or ground level. We are currently investigating it. We don’t have an answer at this point. We’ve checked with our typical sources such as utility companies and anybody maybe drilling or doing construction in the area and at this point in time we don’t’ know what it is.”

University of Wisconsin-Madison Seismologist Harold Tobin said he was not aware of any seismic readings or reports near Montello. So it was strange – like a politically motivated cover-up – that at a Tuesday, March 22, 2012, public meeting at the Clintonville High School after hiring an engineering firm to locate the underground epicenter of the strange jolting sounds, City Manager Lisa Kuss told the crowd of 400 people that she was pretty certain the sounds had to be related to earthquakes. The reason was that on Tuesday, March 20, 2012, at 12:15 AM thirty miles northwest of Appleton, Wisconsin, near Clintonville, at a depth of 3 miles, there was a small 1.5 magnitude quake registered by the U. S. Geological Survey.

However most of Clintonville residents at the meeting argued they had never heard jolting booms before Sunday night, March 18, 2012. Further, seismologists said there was NO seismic link to the banging noises from March 18 to the 22nd, no seismic activity in the Montello region either, and that earthquake activity usually happens more than one mile deep rather than the shallow, less than 1-mile-down, original estimate for the mysterious banging, jolting sounds.

966,"This week Chevron announced that it had made a nice oil discovery at the Moccasin prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. It's about time. Chevron had begun drilling the well in early 2010 before BP's Macondo blowout. It had to stop the operation when the Obama administration invoked its moratorium on gulf drilling. The new Bureau of Ocean Energy Management allowed Chevron to resume spinning its drill bits in March. The discovery is one of the very deepest ever made in the gulf. Not only is the water at Moccasin deep -- nearly 6,800 feet -- but the final depth reached was a remarkable 31,000 feet. That's six miles down.

In contrast, BP's ill-fated Macondo blew out at around 18,000 feet deep. BP is a partner with Chevron in Moccasin with an equal 43.75% share. The other partner is Samson Offshore Company with 12.5%. Samson is one of the world's biggest private oil and gas explorers. Based in Tulsa, Okla. it is owned by billionaire Lynn Schusterman, widow of its founder Charles Schusterman (d. 2000).

Even under the best of circumstances, drilling a well so deep is a costly endeavor, totalling more than $100 million. In this case, considering the added costs imposed by moratorium delays (temporarily abandoning the well, keeping a drillship on standby, another round of bureaucratic permitting and placating), drilling Moccasin likely cost upwards of $200 million. Still, drilling costs are only the beginning of the capital outlay that would be required to bring Moccasin's riches to the surface. Chevron is investing $7.5 billion to develop its Jack/St. Malo field, and another $4.1 billion on Big Foot.

Not to be outdone, BP today announced a ""significant resource extention"" at its deepwater Mad Dog field. It's no news that Mad Dog is a winner -- production began back in 2005, and additional appraisal wells in 2008 and 2009 confirmed additional pay. BP says that the entirety of the Mad Dog complex has some 4 billion barrels of oil and gas in place (out of which maybe 2 billion will be ultimately recoverable). That, says Chief Executive Robert Dudley in the statement, puts Mad Dog on par with BP's giant Thunderhorse field.

The most recent Mad Dog well was drilled by Australian mining giant BHP Billiton. BHP operating the prospect would be unusual in any other circumstance, considering that it has just a 24% stake in the prospect to BP's 60% and far less experience with such tricky wells. But BHP doesn't have the gulf baggage that BP carries, and it's shown a real desire to take operating roles in U.S. fields, having this year bought out Chesapeake Energy's Fayetteville Shale position for $5 billion and in the midst of acquiring Petrohawk for $15 billion.

As if anyone had forgotten, discoveries like these show that there remains massive opportunities for oil and gas discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico, especially in the so-called Lower Tertiary Wilcox trend, which Chevron says could contain 12 billion barrels. In June, ExxonMobil revealed that it had discovered two fields there with 700 million barrels. BP figures its 2009 Tiber discovery has another couple billion. (There's big opportunities for jobs too. Analysts figure that a return to normal activity in the Gulf of Mexico could add 230,000 jobs.)

Since Macondo the gulf has been largely overshadowed by onshore shale plays, and a lack of drilling in the gulf has led to production delining there by more than 250,000 bpd. Some operators like Devon Energy have sold out of their deepwater prospects entirely, citing the huge costs involved. But its clear that the biggest and most experienced operators like Chevron are in the gulf to stay.

With that in mind, this is a good opportunity to reprise a story I wrote for Forbes Magazine nearly a year ago on how Chevron's top notch seismic imaging team is using incredible computing power to peer deep into the earth. You can find the original tale in full here.

Here's some of the highlights:

In Houston Chevron's geologists literally sit on top of 8 petabytes of seismic data--enough to fill 900,000 DVDs--housed in two floors of computer servers. Each day they collect roughly 5 terabytes of new data. The 10,000 square miles of 3-D renderings the geologists have stitched together constitute one of the most comprehensive models of the geology of the Gulf of Mexico. Imaging through rock is one thing, but seismic data get scrambled when it bounces off layers of salt deep under the seabed. To begin peering through the salt, Chevron in the early 1990s deployed a $1 million Cray supercomputer to process gulf seismic data in three dimensions. Emboldened, the company began enthusiastically leasing deepwater exploration blocks from the U.S. Government. There, hiding under a layer of salt as thick as 15,000 feet, Chevron found the Tahiti field, which now produces 125,000 barrels per day from reservoirs 25,000 feet deep. This year Chevron retired its last supercomputer and replaced it with $10,000 of gear on every desktop. What would have taken three months to render on a Cray in 1993 now takes two hours or less on a PC, says Barney Issen, Chevron's senior geophysicist in charge of interpreting seismic data. To crunch heavy loads, Chevron networks its computers into Linux-based clusters with hundreds of processors operating in parallel. These days a lot of Chevron's combined brain and computer power is tuned to peer into the gulf's promising Lower Tertiary Wilcox trend. For decades geologists have discovered bountiful oil and gas onshore in the Wilcox zone. In the deep water, large swaths of Wilcox sediment slumped over the side of the continental shelf and were swallowed by a layer of salt that dates back to when the American continents pulled away from Europe and Africa. In 2005, when Chevron discovered oil in the subsalt Jack 2 well, the offshore Wilcox emerged as a giant new resource. Chevron plans to invest $7.5 billion to develop Jack. ""When I started, geologists were considered heretics for dreaming that there could be salt canopies with reservoir-quality rock beneath them,"" says Issen. Now they understand that as sediment builds up on top of salt, it pushes the salt out of the way. Like an upside-down lava lamp, in time the sediment sinks under the salt. Think of the salt layer as one of those glass blocks used to build bathroom walls. It lets light and color through, but you can't make out any detail. However, if you can figure out the curves (topography) on the front and back of the glass, you can write computer algorithms to correct for them. With the right algorithms backed by enough computing power, the salt layer can be transformed from a blinder into a lens. Issen shows a 3-D projection of a prospective well called Buckskin. A purple blob of older sediment slumps underneath the salt layer, and a ""bump"" in the rock is a telltale sign that oil is trapped beneath. ""You don't get to see that it is a bump until you've sorted out all this stuff [the salt] above it,"" explains Issen. Last year Chevron announced that test wells drilled 29,000 feet deep into Buckskin found oil-bearing sands 300 feet thick.",mainstream
1298,"A MAN claims he has found the fossilised head of the legendary Bigfoot.

Todd May, from Ogden, Utah, U.S, says he found the 75 pound rock, which he believes is part of the mythical hairy oversized ape-like creature, while hiking near his home.

He told Times Record News: ""I would go out there often and find things, fossils, rocks. I looked around for about half an hour, then I saw it.""

Bigfoot has been spotted hundreds of times in the north west of the United States.

The creature is sometimes referred to as Sasquatch and is said to roam the forests.

As well as finding what he believes is a fossilised head, May says he has seen the beast itself – in fact two creatures he thinks are in the Bigfoot family.

When taking a hike in Ogden Canyon, his first encounter was a shock: ""The first time I saw one I was startled, it looked like an ape from the zoo.”

May says the creature looked at him before running off.

He returned to the area hoping to spot Bigfoot again, and he was rewarded with another close encounter.

May recalled he felt someone or something throwing rocks at him: ""I just thought it was kids, but then my friend was playing her flute outside and had a couple of witnesses who saw the Bigfoot.

""The red-furred one was a lot bigger and it spooked me more.”

A year later he and his friends saw another unidentified animal, which May believes was also a Bigfoot:

He says he was hiking through the wilderness with a flashlight: ""I heard across the river someone say, 'Oh my God! It's a monster!'""

The beam of his light lit up the face of a red-furred ape-like creature, which was around eight-to ten-foot tall and was about 20 feet away.

When he returned to the area a few months later, he saw what he thought was a large handprint.

Digging in the dirt, he found the fossil, with the same face as the creature he had seen.

May found the head in 2013, and not everyone has believed he has a Bigfoot head on his hands: “When you actually see it, you can't help but see that it's a face.”

Assistant Professor Jesse Carlucci, from the Kimball School of Geoscience, Midwestern State University said he believes it is just a rock: ""Often, the natural fractures or joints in the rock are sites of increased weathering, where you have these types of depressions form. It's not Bigfoot!""

787,"PRETORIA (Reuters) – Wing Sevu Reece scored a hat-trick of tries as the Canterbury Crusaders made light work of the Bulls with a comprehensive 45-13 Super Rugby victory at Loftus Versfeld on Friday.

The defending champions ran in seven tries, were incisive on attack, and preyed on the numerous errors and soft tackling of the home side.

Flyhalf Richie Mo’unga bagged a brace of tries, and was masterful in steering the Crusaders attack, to go with scores from locks Mitchell Dunshea and Scott Barrett.

Centre Burger Odendaal crossed for the lone try for the Bulls, who went into the weekend on top of the South African Conference and now face a four-match tour of Australasia.

“We had a good week’s preparation here and had a good plan going into the game. It’s always pleasing when you can execute that in the game,” Crusaders captain Matt Todd said at the post-match presentation.

“We knew we were going to hurt out there, but at crucial times we were able to get points and our defence was pretty good too. Our plan coming in was to push ourselves and play at pace, so credit to the boys.”

The Bulls had no answer to the creativity of the Crusaders in the opening half as the visitors kept the tempo high, a risky strategy at altitude, and ran in four tries to lead 26-6 at the break.

Mo’unga was at the heart of most of their good play with penetrating running as he profited from a kind bounce to cross for his first try, and then scythed through a limp home defence to score his second.

Second rower Dunshea showed great pace and determination to run in from 35 metres and cross in the corner for his first Super Rugby try, while Reece had an easy score when the Crusaders created a massive overlap on the right and gave the wing a simple opportunity to finish.

It was more of the same at the start of the second period as the Crusaders continued to dominate territory and the flat-footed Bulls defence was bamboozled by a fine step from Reece, who crossed for his second.

There was some reprieve for the home side as a period of sustained pressure inside the Crusaders 22 ended with Odendaal crossing under the posts.

But the Crusaders regained the momentum when Mo’unga’s brilliant kick across the field was perfect for Reece to pluck the ball out of the air and secure his hat-trick.

The final score came from Barrett as he barged through more limp home defending following an attacking lineout.

“You have to give credit to the Crusaders, they are an unbelievable rugby side and every week they produce these performances,” Bulls captain Handre Pollard said.

“If you give them momentum it’s just quick ball, quick ball and you are on the back foot the whole time. But we know New Zealand sides play that way.”",mainstream
21,"This article is from June 2003, NBC's show ""Fear Factor""



 

 Ask Fear Factor contestants what it's like to eat horse rectum and odds are they'll tell you it just plain stinks. Here's contestant Holli Joy Lamb to butt in with her whole story… 

 

 FEAR FACTOR: What did you think when Joe Rogan revealed that you'd be eating horse rectum? 

 

 HOLLI JOY LAMB: When Joe pulled out the horse rectum and he told us what it was, I didn't think that we were going to be able to perform the stunt. Because, initially, I did not think I would be able to even take one bite, never mind eat over a foot of it. 

 

 FEAR FACTOR: Was it helpful that you didn't have to go first? 

 

 HOLLI JOY LAMB: [Contestant Nicole Sintihakis] had referred to it as tasting like chicken so, I thought, ""Well, maybe if I just kept that in my mind, it wouldn't be so bad and I'd actually be able to do it."" However, eating the horse rectum was exactly what it sounded like. I mean, there was no chicken tasting involved. It tasted exactly like a horse's ass. 

 

 FEAR FACTOR: What about the smell? Did that make it worse? 

 

 HOLLI JOY LAMB: I mean the smell was just as bad as the taste. That was one strategy thing I was trying to do, to keep the pile of rectum away from my mouth and tear off small pieces. Because if I held it up close to my face like Nicole had been doing, the smell would have overwhelmed me. 

 

 FEAR FACTOR: Once you got rid of the smell factor, what was your next step to overcome? 

 

 HOLLI JOY LAMB: As I progressively started eating the rectum I kept noticing how hard it was to separate the tissue for me. And I actually started getting really nervous about choking because I saw that as such a big factor in eating it. I pretty much was almost guaranteeing myself that I was going to choke on this…horribly. That was the biggest problem that I was having…swallowing it. But I was trying to keep my mind distant as much as possible. But it's hard. I never expected to be able to eat over a foot of the rectum. 

 

 FEAR FACTOR: Was it difficult to chew? 

 

 HOLLI JOY LAMB: Oh! It was so chewy. And that's what took me so long. I felt I was chewing and chewing and chewing and chewing just to get it down. And my body was rejecting it, but I was eventually swallowing it. But what took me the longest was the chewing. 

 

 FEAR FACTOR: What part of the rectum was the hardest to get down? 

 

 HOLLI JOY LAMB: Every time I gagged was when I consumed these juicy little jelly balls. I don't know what they were. But they were these balls that, when you crunch down, they just exploded in your mouth. And that's every single time that my body just said, ""No."" And I gagged, basically. It was absolutely disgusting. Tearing apart the pieces, just ripping them through my fingers, I could feel the different layers. And it was so juicy and warm. And it was nauseating. It was exactly what you would think horse rectum would be like. 

 

 FEAR FACTOR: Let's take a little break. Are you feeling alright? 

 

 HOLLI JOY LAMB: God, I'm getting sick just thinking about it.",conspiracy
365,"Video of an intriguing covered nest-like structure found abandoned in Arizona is being hailed as a possible home of the legendary Bigfoot.

With a narrow entrance and hollowed inside, the lair is buried half under the ground in the wild woods of the Tonto National Forest on the Mogollon Rim.

Discovered in June of 2010 and featuring on Animal Planet’s current ‘Finding Bigfoot’ series, the footage of the large mysterious den unfortunately offers up little evidence that the fabled giant ape ever dwelt inside.

This unexplained structure in the forests around Arizona is believed by Bigfoot experts in the state to have housed the legendary ape-like creature

Filmed by Arizona researcher and Bigfoot expert Mitch Waite and his wife, Susan Farnsworth, the nest is reputed to be of the big-foot type creature called the Mogollon Monster, who crypto-zoologists believe inhabits the south west of the United States.

Sightings of the creature have been reported for decades by cowboys, drifters and forestry workers and some claim that the creature has attacked and mauled people.

151,"DAKAR - Tens of thousands of people from across Senegal converged on the capital Dakar on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, claimed to be the largest in West Africa.

Muslim faithful arrived by bus, car or on foot in the poor district of Bopp, home to the new Massalikul Jinaan mosque, capable of hosting 30,000 worshippers.

The mosque has been built by the Mouride Brotherhood -- part of the Sufi strand of Islam that predominates in Senegal, a country with a long tradition of religious tolerance.

Huge traffic jams several kilometers (miles) long built up on highways leading to the site, where some people had starting camping out two days before the long-awaited ceremonies.

Work on the mosque began a decade ago on a swampy six-hectare (14-acre) area of land donated by the government of the 90-percent Muslim nation, and the inauguration has been preceded by an outpouring of national and religious fervour.

The mosque's name of Massalikul Jinaan (""The Paths to Paradise"") comes from the title of a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the Brotherhood, who is revered by followers as a saint.

With a Carrara marble exterior and boasting five minarets -- the tallest 78 meter (255 feet) high -- the mosque has a capacity of 15,000 worshippers inside, and another 15,000 on an outside esplanade.

The lavish interiors include a gold-leaf dome, giant chandeliers and decorations hand drawn by Moroccan workmen. An Islamic institute, residence and museum are scheduled to be added in the future.

The builders say the mosque is the biggest in West Africa, although the edifice is dwarfed by mosques in the Arab world. In Morocco, the Hassan II mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 worshippers and has a minaret spiraling 210 meters.

The cost of more than 30 million euros ($33 million) came from private donations, while the government contributed lighting, sanitation and roadworks worth 10.5 million euros as well as the land -- a sign of the Brotherhood's clout.

The group's leader, Mountakha Mbacke, received a stream of religious, traditional and political leaders in the runup to the inauguration, and the ceremonies were to be attended by President Macky Sall.

The Mourides are one of four important Sufi brotherhoods followed by Senegal's Muslims, who overwhelmingly practice a moderate version of Islam while following the teachings of local spiritual guides.",mainstream
709,"Corns and calluses are hard, painful areas of skin that often develop on the feet in response to pressure or friction. They happen when the skin tries to protect an underlying area from injury, pressure, or rubbing. Neither is dangerous, but they can cause irritation. They are more common among people who wear ill-fitting shoes, have sweaty feet, and those who stand for long periods each day. They affect women more than men. Here are some facts about corns and calluses. There is more detailed information in the main article,
• Corns have a distinct, often hard, center, which may be surrounded by inflamed skin.
• Corns can be painful when pressed, but calluses are not usually painful.
• Calluses are usually larger than corns, and they vary in shape, while corns tend to be smaller, round and well-defined.
• Calluses normally develop on the soles of the feet, especially under the heels or balls, on the palms of the hands, and also on the knees. Corns often occur in non-weight-bearing parts of the skin.
• A pumice stone or over-the-counter topical medicine can be used to treat corns and calluses without going to see a doctor.
• Painful corns or calluses may need medical attention.
• Lifestyle and clothing changes can help prevent corns and calluses.

What is the difference between corns and calluses? People sometimes mistakenly use the terms corns and calluses interchangeably, but they are not the same. A callus is a section of skin that has become toughened and thick because of friction, pressure, or irritation. They often happen on the feet, but they can occur on the hands, elbows, or knees. Calluses are yellowish or pale in color. They feel lumpy to the touch, but, as the skin is thick, it may be less sensitive to touch compared with the skin around it. Calluses are often bigger and wider than corns, with less defined edges. They commonly appear where the skin frequently rubs against something, such as a bone, some item of footwear, or the ground. They typically form over the bony area just under the toes, areas of skin that take the person’s weight when they are walking. A corn is a kind of callus, made of dead skin. They usually form on smooth, hairless skin surfaces, especially on the top or the side of the toes. They are usually small and circular, with a clearly defined center that can be hard of soft. Hard corns tend to be small, and they occur in areas of firm, hard skin, where the skin has thickened or where there are calluses, and in bony areas of the foot. Soft corns tend to be whitish in color, with a rubbery texture. They more commonly occur between the toes, in areas of moist and sweaty skin. Calluses and corns are not normally harmful, but sometimes they may lead to infections or ulcerations of the skin, especially among people with diabetes and those with poor circulation in the feet.

Calluses have become toughened and thick due to friction. People can normally carry out treatment at home using over-the-counter products, but in especially painful cases may wish to see a podiatrist. Corns and calluses can make a person feel as if they are walking on stones. The following signs or symptoms may indicate that there is a corn or callus:
• skin that is flaky and dry or flaky and waxy
• pain or tenderness under the skin If a corn or callus becomes very inflamed or painful, the patient should seek medical advice. Patients with poor circulation, fragile skin, or nerve problems and numbness in the feet should talk to their doctors before treating corns and calluses at home. People with diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral arterial disease need to be particularly watchful.

A podiatrist might cut away some of the thick skin with a scalpel to relieve pressure on the tissues that lie beneath. People should not cut the corn or callus themself as it could make it more painful and the risk of infection is high. More information on removing calluses and corns can be found in the “home remedies” section below.

The following risk factors are linked to a higher incidence of corns and calluses:
• anything that causes pressure or friction on the skin
• shoes that are too tight or too high-heeled, causing pressure
• shoes that are too loose, causing friction
• a badly placed seam in a shoe that rubs against the skin
• socks that do not fit well
• walking barefoot regularly, as the skin will thicken to protect itself
• repeated actions such as jogging or walking in a particular way
• older age, as there is less fatty tissue in the skin, which means less padding and a higher risk of developing calluses, especially on the ball of the foot Calluses often appear on the feet, but friction and pressure can also cause calluses on the hands. People who frequently cycle or use hand tools without wearing gloves can develop them. Repeated kneeling or resting elbows on a table can cause calluses on the knees or elbows. Bunions, hammertoe, and other foot problems and deformities increase the risk of corns and calluses. A bunion is an abnormal, bony bump that develops on the joint at the base of the big toe. A hammertoe is when a toe becomes curled up like a claw.

People can treat corns and calluses at home with a pumice stone or salicylic acid. Many people treat corns and calluses at home, using over-the-counter products from a pharmacy.
• Soaking the corn or callus in warm water for 5 to 10 minutes, then filing or scraping the area with a pumice stone. Circular or sideways motions help remove dead skin.
• Using moisturizer every day on the feet. Products that contain salicylic acid, urea, or ammonium lactate help soften the dry skin to prepare it for filing.
• If repetitive actions are causing the corns and calluses, avoiding these actions can often solve the problem.
• Shoes and socks that fit properly, protective pads or insoles, and other self-care measure can help. Foam or silicone wedges may be used between the toes to reduce pressure on a corn. Orthotics are custom-made padded shoe inserts which may help people with an underlying foot deformity. A range of orthiotic products are available for purchase online. When to see a doctor If the corn or callus is very painful, or if the person has diabetes, fragile skin, or circulatory problems, it is best to consult a doctor or a podiatrist, who is specialized in foot care. The doctor will examine the feet, ask the person about their lifestyle, and they may check their footwear. A podiatrist, or foot doctor, may remove some of the hard skin that surrounds the corn so that the center of it can be removed. After trimming the skin, the doctor may apply a patch with 40 percent salicylic acid. The patient will need to replace the patch periodically. A pumice stone or metal nail file is usually used to rub away dead skin before applying a new patch. If there is infection or a risk of infection, the doctor may prescribe antibiotic ointment. Red and swollen skin around the corn or callus can indicate an infection. If the doctor suspects there may be an underlying bone structure problem, they may refer the patient for an x-ray, and possibly surgery. The standard treatment for corns and calluses is salicylic acid, which is also used in wart treatment. This is a keratolytic, which means it dissolves the protein, or keratin, that makes up the corn and the dead skin around it. It is available in creams, pads, and plasters, or it can be applied using an applicator or a dropper. The top of the skin will turn white, and the dead tissue can be cut or filed away. Once the corn or callus has gone, the individual can soak and rub down the area with a pumice stone each week, if the hard skin shows signs of from coming back. Salicylic acid comes in different concentrations. Stronger doses may work faster, but it will need a prescription. The ingredients can irritate surrounding skin, so care should be taken when applying it. Do not use this on a cracked corn or callus. When treating corns and calluses at home, it is important not to remove too much skin, as this can lead to pain and infection. Older people and those with diabetes should not scrape, file, or trim their feet at home, as this can lead to infections that are difficult to cure. It could lead to ulcers on the skin. They should ask a doctor before using salicylic acid, as this, too, can cause ulcers. Any cutting or paring of skin is best done by a podiatrist or other health professional. Repeated or regular trimming may be needed, as the corn or callus may recur.

The following measures may help reduce the risk of developing corns and calluses: Wearing well-fitting socks and footwear can help to prevents corns and calluses.
• Wash the feet with soap and water every evening. Use a scrubbing brush.
• Apply a specially moisturizing foot cream after washing and drying them well. Do not use a body lotion. Foot lotions are available for purchase online.
• Wear well-fitting shoes and socks with seams that do not rub the skin.
• Shop for shoes later in the day, when the feet are at their largest, because feet swell slightly as the day progresses.
• Deal with any foot pain or skin irritation as it arises.
• Have a regular check up with a foot specialist.
• When trimming the toenails, cut straight across, and not down at angles or over the edges.
• Use a pumice stone or foot file regularly, and remove hard skin gently. Pumice stones are available for purchase online.
• Wear clean socks every day and use talcum powder to prevent sweating. Talcum powder is available for purchase online.
• Protect the hands when using tools, either with padded gloves or by padding the tool handles. With treatment, corns and calluses can be removed, but they may return without lifestyle or footwear changes.",mainstream
824,"The feet are flexible structures of bones, joints, muscles, and soft tissues that let us stand upright and perform activities like walking, running, and jumping. The feet are divided into three sections:
• The forefoot contains the five toes (phalanges) and the five longer bones (metatarsals).
• The midfoot is a pyramid-like collection of bones that form the arches of the feet. These include the three cuneiform bones, the cuboid bone, and the navicular bone.
• The hindfoot forms the heel and ankle. The talus bone supports the leg bones (tibia and fibula), forming the ankle. The calcaneus (heel bone) is the largest bone in the foot.

Muscles, tendons, and ligaments run along the surfaces of the feet, allowing the complex movements needed for motion and balance. The Achilles tendon connects the heel to the calf muscle and is essential for running, jumping, and standing on the toes.",mainstream
687,"""But,"" added George, who was quite a man on logs himself, ""I never saw any other man do it, before or since.""

George Anderson, a Brown Company foreman, had a crew of fifty or sixty men up on the Little Magalloway River one April, breaking out rollways—that is, the great piles of frozen logs were being pried loose and rolled into the water, which of course was high and fast. One rollway was on a steep bank ten or fifteen feet high, and just below it was an eddy that kept the logs inshore instead of letting them float down with the current.

""They got piled up pretty deep down there,"" George told me, ""so I told the crew to wait while I took a couple of men [a good river boss never sentmen to do dangerous work, he always took them] and went down to pole the logs out into the river. We were working away and had them pretty well cleared out when there came a yell from the men up on the bank. We looked up, and there all the logs on that rollway had broken loose and were starting to roll down on top of us. We turned and ran over the floating logs for the middle of the river. The other two men made it safely, but I didn't.

""My first jump, I landed on my left foot on a big spruce but before I could bring up my right foot another log bobbed out of the water and caught it between the two logs. I stuck my peavey into the log and pulled for all I was worth, but I was stuck there just as if I were in a bear trap. I caught a glimpse of the logs leaping over the bank, and I thought sure my time had come, but Dan Bosse was working up on that rollway and when he saw the fix I was in he ran out and jumped. He jumped ten feet straight down and landed on that log behind me and drove one end of it deep into the water. The other end snapped up past my head like a streak of light, but that didn't bother me. My foot was free then, and I sailed out of there as quick and easy as if I were on a featherbed. And not one second later that rollway landed kerplunk where I had been standing and filled the river ten feet deep with logs. Dan was right behind me on the same big spruce.""

The Connecticut River drive was the greatest one in all the Northeast. No other river was driven for so many years, no other drive went so many miles—four hundred down to Hartford, two hundred and fifty in later years to Holyoke and Mt. Tom. It was more than an ordinary log drive; it was practically an institution. The first long-log drive went down the Connecticut from the head waters in 1869, and every year thereafter until 1915. After that, pulpwood was driven in four-foot bolts until 1929. Over on the Androscoggin, the Brown Company still drives pulpwood, although the last of the long logs came down in 1930. Since then the riverman has been out of work.

The Connecticut River drive ended in a burst of glory. The Connecticut Valley Lumber Company owned most of northern New Hampshire and much of adjacent Vermont and Maine. The company was owned and headed by George Van Dyke, a two-fisted ex-riverman of the old school. He didn't own a pair of shoes until he was twelve years old, but in the spring of 1909 he died a millionaire in a tragic accident when his chauffeur-driven car backed over a cliff at Turners Falls, having come too close to the bank so that he might view the driving crew picking a jam in the river.",mainstream
1071,"BERLIN — Angela Merkel wants to be remembered as the German chancellor who brought growth to Africa.

Under pressure to stem the numbers of migrants making their way to Europe, Merkel is looking to make fostering economic ties between the world’s richest countries and its poorest continent one of her legacy issues — and Africa has received the message.

“We really pay homage to Ms. Merkel’s will,” Alpha Condé, the president of Guinea and the current chairperson of the African Union, said in an interview on the sidelines of this year’s G20 summit. “It’s really an important turning point for cooperation with Africa.”

Merkel’s plan? Pushing private investment in Africa through individual one-on-one contracts between rich nations and African countries, with the aim of boosting a sluggish economy. Sub-Saharan Africa's growth was 3 percent in 2015 falling to 1.3 percent in 2016, according to the World Bank — the region's worst economic performance in two decades.

“Africa is our immediate neighborhood,” she said at the end of the G20 summit, launching a partnership concept that builds heavily on the initiative “Compact with Africa,” which carries the thumbprint of her finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble.

African Union Chairperson Condé, whose own country is not among the seven initial partner countries, applauded the initiative, adding that “the compact is a new form of financing that will better help us solve the issue of migration.”

It was migration that brought Africa's prosperity to the forefront of political debate in Merkel’s home country.

For years, Germany did not experience any large-scale arrivals of undocumented migrants from outside Europe, in part due to its geographic location, and as a result it paid little attention to economic development south of the Mediterranean.

In 2015 however, when almost a million asylum seekers — mostly from war-torn Syria or Afghanistan — arrived in Germany, the country began to debate the question of how to control a potential influx of migrants to Europe.

As migrants increasingly reach the Continent by sea from Africa, the debate has shifted to how to prevent people from leaving their home countries.

“Africa is coming,” ran the front-page headline on a weekly magazine published by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung last week, showing a giant black foot leaving the African continent.

Against this backdrop, and as voters are heading to the ballots in around two months, Merkel is eager to send out the message that she's tackling the issue.

“If there’s too much hopelessness in Africa, of course there will be young people who say they need to find a life elsewhere in the world,” Merkel said last month during a preparatory G20 Africa summit, where she welcomed nine African leaders to Berlin.

“By cooperating with those countries we are also creating more security again for ourselves,” she added.

The political message to her electorate aside, migration experts doubt Merkel's strategy will prove successful in preventing people from coming.

""The narrative is: More investment will lead to jobs being created and then people stay in their home countries,” said Barbara Sennholz-Weinhardt of the anti-poverty NGO Oxfam. “However, it is wrong to see private investment and development cooperation as a way to contain migration.”

This, she warned, “dismisses many lessons learned during the past decades on how sustainable development cooperation should be done,” adding: “Empirical evidence strongly suggests that migration makes a positive contribution to development due to migrants' remittances.""

The positive effect of outbound migration is the elephant in the room when rich countries and developing nations discuss the issue: While destination countries are interested in keeping migration down, many developing countries profit economically from the money sent home by those who leave.

Aware of this, the German government recently released a potpourri of initiatives to push development: besides the “Compact with Africa,” there is a “Marshall Plan for Africa” and a ""Pro! Afrika” plan focused on digitalization.

“All of this was uncoordinated, everyone became involved suddenly,” complained Uwe Kekeritz, a German member of parliament and the Green party’s spokesperson on development policy. “But the issue of refugees had to be picked up somehow.”

Kekeritz called it “naïve” to assume that living conditions will automatically improve in African countries if private investment is boosted, adding: “The past has shown us that big investment often leads to ecological catastrophes, which then, in turn, lead to humanitarian catastrophes.""

In addition, he said, it will be largely the wealthier countries in Africa that will profit from the initiative, while many of the 34 countries in Africa that the U.N. considers “least developed countries” (LDC) could go away empty-handed.

Guinean President Condé, whose country is among those LDCs, demanded that along with investment partnerships, European countries provide financial guarantees for their companies investing in Africa.

In addition, “more flexibility is necessary, especially with regard to debt,” he told POLITICO, adding that when African countries' debt levels start to climb, the International Monetary Fund ""starts to cry.”

Little has been announced when it comes to details for the “Compact with Africa,” apart from the list of seven initial partner countries: Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Ghana, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal and Tunisia.

“The only thing now is to know how to continue once … Germany no longer holds the G20 presidency,” Condé said. “Our preoccupation now is to ensure that this continues.""

Argentina takes over the G20 presidency from Germany in 2018. Argentine President Mauricio Macri's cabinet chief, Marcos Peña, told POLITICO that Buenos Aires was committed to continuing the initiative. Diplomats, however, cautioned privately that the South American country has many development issues much closer to hand and has limited traditional links to Africa.

Merkel can be expected to push the Argentines to continue with the ""Compact with Africa"" initiative. “We are the driving force,” the German chancellor said in Hamburg. “This is only the beginning.”",mainstream
1216,"The National Motor Museum at Beaulieu has added another event, Truckmania, to its already packed schedule.

Taking place over the Bank Holiday weekend of May 26 and 27, Truckmania brings together what Beaulieu describes as the giants of the motoring world, including a version of the original monster truck, Bigfoot.

Billed as a family-friendly event, Truckmania will allow visitors to get up close to some of the world's biggest trucks, and learn about the history of these enormous vehicles. In attendance will be everything from 100-year-old horse-drawn dray wagons to the latest eco-friendly lorries, many of which will take part in a rolling demonstration.

For many, however, it will be the chance to see Bigfoot in action that is the highlight of the event. Now in its 10th year of performing in the UK, Bigfoot will be taking part in two displays each day, with plenty of cars set to be crushed, plus demonstrations of its fearsome power.

Elsewhere, young visitors can get involved in the action by taking a ride in mini trucks on Beaulieu's driving circuit.

Visitors to Truckmania can also head to the Bond in Motion and World of Top Gear exhibitions at Beaulieu, as well as visit the National Motor Museum itself. For more information and to book tickets, visit www.beaulieu.co.uk",mainstream
861,"When a letter from BlackRock’s founder and chief executive, Larry Fink, landed in inboxes in January saying that the world’s biggest investor would no longer invest in companies that are not compliant with the Paris climate agreement, people took notice. The media jumped on the announcement, which appeared to herald a new era of finance facing up to the perils of the climate emergency.

The letter was a hoax, carried out by the Yes Men, a group of pranksters with a history of embarrassing big companies. But while the message was fake, the concern behind it was not: environmental campaigners see BlackRock as a key obstacle to progress on meeting climate crisis goals.

Now they are stepping up the pressure on the world’s biggest asset manager – which faces its shareholders at its annual meeting on Thursday – to use its influence on some of the world’s biggest polluters, as it has done previously on issues such as executive pay.

Fink, who was paid $24m (£18.8m) in 2018, began BlackRock as part of Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity group, and spun it out in 1995. Since then, New York-based BlackRock has risen to become an investing behemoth, controlling $6.5tn in assets – a value more than twice the annual output of the UK economy.

That staggering size has placed BlackRock at the heart of the global fossil fuel industry: it is the largest investor in coal worldwide, according to InfluenceMap, an environmental campaign group, and has by far the highest density of coal holdings of the world’s 10 largest investors. BlackRock effectively owns 2.1bn tonnes of thermal coal reserves, based on the size of its stakes in major miners.

BlackRock is counted among the top three shareholders in every oil “supermajor” bar France’s Total, and is among the top 10 shareholders in seven of the 10 biggest coal producers, according to Guardian analysis of data from financial information firm S&P.

Yet Fink, 66, who moves in US Democrat political circles, argues it is not his company’s duty to fight the climate emergency. In the real version of his annual letter to shareholders, published in January, Fink said that his overriding duty is to make customers money.

“Our firm is built to protect and grow the value of our clients’ assets,” Fink wrote. “We often get approached by special interest groups who advocate for BlackRock to vote with them on a cause. In many cases, I or other senior managers might agree with that same cause – or we might strongly disagree – but our personal views on environmental or social issues don’t matter here. Our decisions are driven solely by our fiduciary duty to our clients.”

After publication of this article, BlackRock contacted the Guardian to clarify it that considers climate change a significant investment risk that has the potential to impact the long-term value of many companies.

Critics argue this approach is not financially sustainable in the long term, given the likelihood that the climate crisis is expected to make some business models redundant or even illegal through measures such as bans on petrol- and diesel-powered cars or fossil fuel companies being forced to leave oil in the ground.

Lauren Compere, a managing director at Boston Common Asset Management, a US investor, said investor action on the climate emergency was “not about being political”, but was rather a case of looking at the risks presented by the crisis to savers’ assets. Compere, whose job involves engaging with companies over issues such as the climate crisis, said other investment funds could put greater pressure on businesses.

“There are big players that could be more proactive, more consistent, and frankly should probably be leveraging their assets more,” she said. “Across the globe it is not acceptable to sit on the fence not leveraging your assets.”

Casey Harrell, a senior campaigner at the Sunrise Project, part of a broad coalition of groups putting pressure on BlackRock’s environmental record, said: “There is a real big disconnect between words and deeds that needs to be highlighted.”

Investment strategies that follow environmentally friendly companies should be part of BlackRock’s core offer to clients, rather than an option they must actively choose, he added.

BlackRock has acknowledged the growing demand for greener investment products as it tries to gain millennials as customers and employees. In October 2017 it hired Barack Obama’s former climate change adviser, Brian Deese, to be managing director of its sustainable investing business, which now has $32bn in assets under management. Former UK chancellor George Osborne is another part-time employee, earning £650,000 a year, although climate crisis was not included on the list of topics – such as China and European politics – that he is advising on.

Regarding investment attitudes towards companies that are undeniably contributing to the climate emergency, BlackRock and other major investors argue it is better to push for change from within. After publication BlackRock contacted the Guardian to clarify that the large majority of its equity holdings are held through index funds and ETFs, which are designed to track indices controlled by third parties in which customers have chosen to invest. As a result, BlackRock focuses on engaging with companies to understand how they are managing material risks, including climate related risks, a spokeswoman said.

With BlackRock’s scale, meaningful engagement would be a gargantuan task. BlackRock’s stewardship team of 43 people – which decides how BlackRock votes at shareholder meetings – must cover every major listed company in the world across 90 markets.

When it does engage, evidence of progress is limited. BlackRock said it had 232 “engagements” with companies on climate-related matters during the year to June 2018. Only a fifth of the companies bothered to respond in “substantive fashion” to requests to disclose climate risks to their businesses – or to say why they did not plan to do so. BlackRock could not provide any quantitative evidence that its engagement approach was working.

Research by Majority Action, a pressure group, found that BlackRock lags many of its rivals in supporting climate-related resolutions.In the year ending 31 August 2018, BlackRock supported only 23% of climate crisis reporting proposals – to make companies report their carbon dioxide emissions or their exposure to climate emergency-related risks – compared with 33% at US-based Vanguard and 85% at the UK’s largest asset manager, Legal & General.

In some cases BlackRock has stood in the way of environmental action. The company voted against a 2018 proposal for Royal Dutch Shell to carry out detailed scenario planning for a world affected by temperature rises of 2°C, “because we found the proposal overly prescriptive”.

In the case of US oil company Chevron, BlackRock was among the investors that could have tipped the balance in favour of imposing targets for reducing emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas. Some 45% of shareholders voted in favour, but BlackRock and Vanguard, both of which held more than 6% of the votes, opposed the motion.

In a statement to the Guardian, BlackRock said it was better, given the firm’s commitment to long-term investment in businesses, to discuss climate policy with companies than to challenge them through shareholder resolutions. “Given the multi-year nature of the energy transition and the challenge of addressing climate change, our process emphasises engagement before voting because we find that is the most effective way to achieve productive outcomes in our clients’ long-term interests.”

While BlackRock is by no means the only investor dragging its feet on climate issues, its power and totemic place at the top of the investment world mean it could have an outsized impact, according to activists.

“There’s a bit of a herding mentality in the institutional investors,” said Jeanne Martin, a senior campaigner on fossil fuels at ShareAction, a responsible investment charity. “If they start using their shareholder rights at these companies that would really shift the dial.”

912,"Chinese citizens will be forced to pass a facial recognition test to use the Internet in the latest expansion of the country’s draconian social credit score system.

“At present, a Chinese citizen will need to show his or her ID card while applying for a landline or the internet,” reports the Daily Mail. “The facial-recognition test is set to verify that the ID card belongs to the applicant.”

Under its social credit score system, China punishes people who criticize the government, as well as numerous other behaviors, including;

– Bad driving.

 – Smoking on trains.

 – Buying too many video games.

 – Buying too much junk food.

 – Buying too much alcohol.

 – Calling a friend who has a low credit score .

945,"Be the first to know about every new Coronavirus story

Just over a year ago, before the modern plague descended, Manhattan's Hudson Yards threw a launch party that was Versailles-like in its overabundance of champagne, oysters, top chefs, beautiful people and other trappings of a great city.

But on a recent afternoon, Hudson Yards was a ghost town. Its 1m-square-foot shopping mall was shuttered and its anchor tenant, Neiman Marcus, would soon declare bankruptcy. The Vessel public art sculpture — likened by one reviewer to a giant doner kebab, and usually teeming with tourists — was empty but for a security guard patrolling its base.

The only foot traffic was a steady stream of soldiers, who had been treating Covid-19 patients at the hastily-erected field hospital at the nearby Javits convention centre. They were lined up, at six-foot intervals, to collect free meals at a Hudson Yards storefront that had been converted into a soup kitchen. Alongside them were delivery drivers, postal workers, office cleaners and others manning the frontlines in New York City’s struggle against coronavirus.

The tableau is a reminder of how drastically the virus has transformed New York, which has potentially suffered more deaths than any other city in the world, in just a matter of weeks. As New Yorkers inch towards a reopening, probably next month, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio, they are contemplating with trepidation how their city will emerge from the pandemic — and what sort of future it will find on the other side.

More than other large cities, New York exemplifies the urban characteristics that the virus has turned into vulnerabilities — population density, sky-high cost of living, a reliance on retail, culture and tourism and a dependence on crowded public transport.

The modern history of New York City is one of periodic disasters shadowed by the fear of exodus — to other cities that are cheaper, safer, more convenient. There was the 1970s fiscal crisis and the decay that followed; the 1987 stock market crash; the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks; and the 2008 financial crisis — not to mention various hurricanes, floods and power failures.

Yet in each case the doomsayers were proved wrong. The city bounced back stronger than before, and in some ways, reinvented itself. September 11, for example, gave rise to a more vibrant downtown and set in motion Hudson Yards, a $25bn development that is North America’s largest. After 2008, the world’s financial capital morphed into a technology hub to rival Silicon Valley and strengthened its magnetic pull on a new generation of talent.

“No one is working in New York because it’s cheaper or easier. Nobody. It’s because the talent is here,” says Mary Ann Tighe, chief executive for the tri-state area at CBRE, the real estate services group.

Carl Weisbrod, a veteran of city government who led the revival of Times Square in the late 1980s under Ed Koch and was recently appointed by Mr de Blasio to a new task force to guide the city’s recovery, acknowledges that the next 18 months will be difficult. But he concludes that “as long as New York holds on to its talent, I have no doubt whatsoever that, as an economic matter, it will recover”.

Other civic leaders tend to echo that reflexive faith in New York’s future. Some even talk about a unique opportunity to reimagine the city — to clear away nettlesome business regulation built up over generations, attract new industries, or correct the social inequities exposed by the crisis.

As Mr de Blasio said recently: “If ever there was a moment, a breakpoint moment, in the city’s history, this is it. It’s time to look anew at everything we do and see what works, what doesn’t work.”

Before New York can set about reinventing itself there is uncertainty, even among its most ardent supporters, as to how the city will bridge the immediate catastrophe. Many are plagued by a troubling sense that this time is different.

“This is much more complicated,” says Carol Kellermann, who ran the charitable fund created after the September 11 terror attack and also led the Citizens Budget Commission advisory group. “I think it’s going to have much deeper, longer-lasting impacts.”

September 11 was brutal and devastating but the world rallied around the city and its economy resumed within days. After 2008, New York City ended up benefiting from policies that pumped vast sums of liquidity into the financial system.

With coronavirus, there is no quick fix in sight. The city’s morgues are overflowing after more than 21,000 fatalities — roughly eight times the city’s toll from the 9/11 attacks — and some are forecasting unemployment will rise to 20 per cent in June. Yet the city is arousing less sympathy from the nation than partisan resentment. New York feels alone.

Worst of all, the very thing that distinguishes New York City and accounts for its unique alchemy — its density — is what makes it so vulnerable to the pandemic. “Other than better treatments and a vaccine, I don’t know that there’s any government policy that can make people feel safer,” Ms Kellermann says.

Those with the means have left, quarantining in places such as the Hamptons, Palm Beach and Aspen. How many will have gone for good, she wonders, if the city’s cultural life is effectively closed and therefore unable to offset its high taxes and other indignities.

“There’s definitely going to be urban flight,” says Winston Fisher, a third-generation developer, who voiced an ever-present fear among New Yorkers of a certain vintage about a reversion to the bad old days. “I grew up in the city. I’ve been robbed at gunpoint. I remember what 59th and 6th used to look like, Times Square,” he recalls. “New York City can be bad. Don’t forget that.”

To prevent that, there is an emerging consensus that authorities must create a sense of safety, just as they managed to do after September 11. Otherwise, it will be impossible to restore business — let alone bring back tourists. It is a public health challenge but also a psychological one.

In the absence of a vaccine, the governor of New York state, Andrew Cuomo, has turned to former mayor Michael Bloomberg to spearhead a testing and tracing system. The hope is that as the city begins to reopen, the testers will be able to quickly find new infections and seal them off before they become outbreaks. As Mr Cuomo readily acknowledges, it is a huge undertaking.

Meanwhile, developers are rushing to refit office buildings that had been designed to accommodate a taste for ever-increasing density. Elevators are being reprogrammed to respond to smartphone apps so there is no need for passengers to touch a button. Internal doors are being removed for the same purpose.

A critical focus in this decontamination is the world’s biggest — and possibly most blighted — underground system. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has begun a regime that would have been unimaginable just a few months ago: to scrub and disinfect each subway car and station every single day.

“New York City and the MTA are fundamentally built on density. That density creates intellectual collaboration and culture and business and Wall Street and finance and design,” says Pat Foye, the MTA chairman, explaining the subway’s essential role as the circulatory system for a global metropolis.

Mr Foye predicts that new cleaning technologies “could be real game-changers in terms of public confidence in the system”. But cleanliness will come at a cost: he estimates “hundreds of millions of dollars” in additional expense at a time when ridership and fare revenue are down by more than 90 per cent.

The MTA has received $3.9bn in emergency funding from the federal government and is already pleading for another $3.9bn infusion just to make it through this year.

That is but one example of the fiscal challenges now lurking at every turn. Mr de Blasio, whose administration has added 30,000 workers to the city’s payroll since he took office in 2014, has estimated the budget shortfall caused by the virus shutdown at $7.4bn. Others have put it closer to $10bn.

Whatever the figure, Seth Pinsky, who led economic development during the Bloomberg administration, worries that it may pose the most direct threat to a virtuous circle in which talent and companies have chased each other to the city.

“The key to New York’s success over the last 20-plus years has been the first-class workforce it has been able to attract,” says Mr Pinsky, who recently took over as head of 92nd Street Y, one of the city’s leading cultural institutions. “What I worry about is that as government starts to react to the fiscal situation we are going to be forced to make cuts to basic services that are going to be so devastating that they will undermine the quality of life in the city.”

Finding ways to preserve restaurants, museums, galleries and the like is not just “having a soft spot for arts and culture”, Mr Pinsky says. Rather, it is essential to maintain the appeal — and viability — of an otherwise expensive and challenging place to live.

When Donald Trump was elected president, some New Yorkers consoled themselves that he was, at least, one of them, and could therefore be counted on to look out for the city’s interests. But his sustained hostility to the city that voted overwhelmingly against him in 2016 is dimming hopes for federal support.

Mr Trump’s 2017 tax cut was largely paid for by punishing New York and other, Democratic-leaning high-tax states. Even if Mr Trump were inclined to help, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has dismissed pleas for coronavirus aid as “blue-state bailouts”.

After September 11, Mr Bloomberg responded to the downturn by raising property taxes, a stream of revenue that accounts for nearly a third of New York City’s $89bn budget. But that trick will not be easily repeated.

Developers may be in no position to shoulder a heavier financial burden at a time when many of their own tenants have stopped paying rent. They are also confronting a larger fear: after a crash course in remote working, some of the city’s biggest employers — including BlackRock and Morgan Stanley — have announced that they will require less office space in the future. If that conclusion is widespread, then Manhattan property values may be headed for a reckoning.

Even before coronavirus, the wealthy were beginning to flee the city’s rising taxes for places such as Florida and Texas. “People are leaving New York and they’re leaving New York in droves,” says Norman Radow, a one-time New York developer who is now based in Atlanta. The coronavirus, he adds, “is just the icing on the cake”.

Still, Mr Radow’s own experience made him wonder if there might be investment opportunities ahead. He first moved to Manhattan in 1978, the depths of the fiscal crisis, and bought a two-bedroom apartment for $63,000. “Everyone thought it was the end of New York,” he recalls. “And look what happened.”

Amid the wreckage there are shards of hope. Some are warming to the possibility that a city that became so overheated in this cheap-money era — a bastion of billionaires, ensconced in Hudson Yards — might now undergo a pandemic-induced reset. Cheaper rents may eventually make the city more accessible for a new generation, who will put spaces to use in ways their elders can scarcely imagine.

“It always happens after every crisis. It seeds the next phase,” says Daniel Kaplan, senior partner at architecture firm FXCollaborative. WeWork, Mr Kaplan notes, was born from the unused office space left in the wake of the 2008 crisis.

Ms Kellermann agrees: “My daughter, who’s 35, says it’s going to go back to what it was in the ‘70s and ‘80s — grittier, but more risk-takers.” (She acknowledges that her daughter had not actually experienced New York in the 1970s — a time when the annual murder rate breached 2,000 and the subway was off-limits after nightfall.)

Mr Fisher now sees a rare chance to streamline an antiquated city government and improve the flow of credit to small businesses. Like other members of the business community, he would also like the city to prioritise the life sciences industry as a next source of high-paying jobs — just as the Bloomberg administration cultivated the tech sector.

Even with Amazon’s decision last year to cancel plans for a second headquarters in Queens, New York City has still managed to attract billions of dollars in investment from the online retailer, as well as Facebook and Google, that have shined and reshaped the city’s west side, including Hudson Yards.

Mr Weisbrod wants to build more affordable housing. “I think the pendulum has swung way too far against development,” he says. “Everybody says they want more affordable housing but nobody wants it in their neighbourhood.”

With coronavirus prying open the public’s eyes to the disparities between rich and poor, there may be the chance. At the same time, Mr Weisbrod and other civic leaders worry how the crisis will eventually shape the city’s politics. Will it be a constructive force that brings reform — or a divisive one that ultimately pits communities against one another?

The race next year to succeed Mr de Blasio as mayor may be one of the most consequential campaigns in the city’s modern history. Will his successor be another self-described “progressive” or a member of the executive class, in the mould of Mr Bloomberg — or something else entirely? Whoever prevails should have faith in New York’s resilience but also, as Mr Pinsky warns, not forget its darker days.

“Those were ugly times,” he says of the 1970s, when New York City’s economic base was wrecked and its population shrank by 800,000 residents. “It took us decades to crawl out of that hole. We should be very careful about not falling back in.”

303,"An AIM patriot sent us a note with a video. We are posting a public reply as many of you have asked about this video which has been shown in full, and in part, around the internet. Our community member writes:

Below is a FYI of a video, reportedly from June 17, 2010, which might be of interest if you have not come across it in the past.

The minutes below are drawn from minutes 4:00 to 16:30…some of the Pilgrim Society plans exposed from a 56 minute video created almost ten years ago.

05:00 In 2010, a retired military whistle blower, outlines a June, 2005 City of London banksters’ meeting he attended. There with some Masons, he served no more purpose than a fly-on-the-wall. At this unusual meeting alarm bells began to fire off in his head upon realizing what the group was talking about.

06:00 This whistle-blower (statement is supported by video and transcript) that there were about thirty senior masons in the meeting room including senior politicians, the chief of police was there; representatives of the church and military were there; 25 or 30 people in the room.

05:56 What they were talking about was a plan created years earlier. This meeting was to update attendees on it status. A report was being given where first they expressed concern the Israeli -Iran war was not following the schedule they had set.

08:00 In this Pilgrim Society meeting they expressed their concerns with China growing as a treat, both military and financially and that Japan was a disappointment in not, as planned, impeding their China’s progress on the global stage.

08:40 Other things discussed were the coming financial crash and the initiation of global centralization of all resources in 2008 was examined in this 2010 session.

10:20 Though the timeline is falling behind, this group is committed to initiating the following:

Israeli launched a war against Iran. Iran will be set up as the bad guys. That is the opening move in a big chess game. Iran has secretly been already provide nuclear weapons by China.

11:25 This cabal actually want this weapons to be used in the Middle East. They want Iran or China to retaliate with a nuclear weapon.

11:45 At the point there will be a “limited” nuclear exchange followed by a cease-fire. This ex-military whistle-blower heard this all being laid out in this meeting like a script to a movie.

12:05 The other thing being set up in many of the western countries for marshal law and people control…ability to arrest, detain…etc. The group wants humanity to demand heavy control on travel and communication due to fears arising from limited nuclear war. This is only the beginning.

15:00 The next thing that happens in this chess game of manipulation of the public is that bio-weapons are released on China. He heard this openly discussed in this meeting. They will release a flu like virus which will be modified genetically to specifically attack the Chinese people. It is designed to spread like wildfire to knock out a large portion of the Chinese people.

And these people in this meeting were laughing about this. They said “China will catch a cold”.

They laughed again about these bio-weapons wreaking havoc across China.

15:50 After that then a plague will sweep across the Western nations…though the whistle blower was not certain if this was due to Chinese retaliation or a mutation of the virus.

So after limited nuclear war, and a bio-weapon release, a pandemic arises around the globe and you have a totalitarian lockdown all around the world because everyone is going to be in a panic about all this.

16:30 …and then the real war starts….the Third World War…

I will be listening to the rest to see where it goes from here.

Betsy replies: I listened to this the other day. Didn’t bother to post, as in my opinion, it is propaganda b.s.. It’s a video distraction to keep the heat off the research AIM and AFI are posting – which are naming names, showing locations on maps, revealing patents and showing you the Queen’s controlling share of QinetiQ. Folks around the world are waking up to see the evil intentions of the Pilgrims Society, Privy Council, and the British Imperial Empire.

In this piece of British propaganda, the speaker says things that are generally true…but offers no concrete evidence or documentation. He’s just telling you a nice story, and, frankly, he takes forever to tell you. It’s called WORD SALAD when they talk and talk…filling space up with words, but never getting to the point.

If you listen, you will hear lots of speculation and conjecture with the mystery man at the mystery meeting. The speaker drops buzz words like “Pilgrims Society” “martial law” “CityofLondon” so you think he is really giving you “the scoop.”

In order to buy his story you first have to believe in the mystery man – which I don’t… so the rest is hearsay, at best..

One of our AIM patriots asked that we offer a prayer to help us get through the storm. Without hesitation, we offer one of our Steiner favorites:

We must eradicate from the soul

All fear and terror of what comes towards man out of the future.

In all feelings and sensations about the future.

We must look forward with absolute equanimity

To everything that may come.

And we must think only that whatever comes

Is given to us by a world-directive full of wisdom.

It is part of what we must learn in this age,

namely, to live out of pure trust,

Without any security in existence.

Trust in the ever present help

Truly, nothing else will do

If our courage is not to fail us.

And let us seek the awakening from within ourselves

Every morning and every evening.",conspiracy
611,"A broker often needs to make a snap decision to buy, sell, or hold a stock. There's no time to consult stock analysts, interview management, or read lengthy research reports. But a quick glance at some key information can lead to a good decision made under pressure.

Say a company just released a press release about its quarterly report. Skip over the filler and look for some of these key facts.

Check to see if the company is growing its sales and, if so, whether the sales growth is sustainable or related to a one-time event.

In addition to checking the sales numbers, you'll have to skim through the entire press release in order to see what management said about the quarter. The numbers plus the comments can tell you if the company experienced growth or just got a windfall.

In general, smaller companies, those in the $100 million to $1 billion sales range, should grow more than 10% annually. Larger companies should be growing by at least 3% a year to be of interest.

Lastly, compare a company's growth in sales not only from last year but from the last quarter. If quarterly sales showed an upward trend, it's usually another good sign.

A company's margins generally improve or deteriorate depending on how well it is managed. If the sales line is going up but costs are going up faster, something is going on there.

It's not necessarily bad news. It could be that the company is entering into a new business, launching a new product, or expanding its footprint. Amazon, for example, infuriated investors for years by investing heavily in warehouses coast-to-coast.﻿﻿ That infrastructure spending finally started paying off.

On the other hand, it could mean that the company is just doing a poor job of managing its expenses. Management's discussion of the quarterly results will help you determine which it is.

Many companies offer Wall Street some sort of guidance on future earnings, and it's nearly always important. How ""the Street"" reacts to the news is equally important.

That is, the company's guidance for the next quarter may be better or worse than Wall Street analysts are expecting. And those expectations will move the stock price up or down, at least short-term.

Delving a bit deeper into the psychology behind earnings guidance, if a company raises its guidance for the current quarter but downplays expectations beyond that, the stock will probably sell-off. If a company reduces its estimates for the current quarter but raises its full-year estimate then the stock will probably take off.

As a rule of thumb, keep your eye on the long term. Most of the time, Wall Street will overlook a short-term stumble if it is convinced that there is an upwards catalyst on the horizon.

When a company uses its cash to buy back its own stock, it's usually a good sign that management believes the stock is undervalued. Repurchase programs will probably be mentioned in the company press release.

That said, management may have other motives. It may want to reduce the total share count in the public domain in order to improve financial ratios or boost earnings, thus making the company more attractive to the analyst community. It may be a public relations ploy to get investors to think the stock is worth more.

Share repurchase programs should be a sign that better times are ahead for the company.

In general, you want to see the total number of outstanding shares staying the same or falling, perhaps as a result of a repurchase program. That means future earnings are spread across fewer shares, making earnings per share higher. As shares outstanding increases, earnings are divided among a larger pool of investors and become diluted, decreasing your potential for profit.

It's virtually impossible to predict whether a new product will be a winner or not. But it's a big mistake to overlook the stocks of the companies that make them.

New products often garner the most attention from consumers and investors. This often helps move the share price higher in the near term. And the company has probably spent a huge amount of money on R&D and promotions as it positions itself to take in a whole lot of money.

Consider, for example, Apple's release of the iPod in 2001. Initially, some investors and analysts were skeptical that the company could deliver meaningful revenues from the device.﻿﻿ As it turned out, that device propelled Apple's growth throughout the decade.﻿﻿

Of course, new products don't always turn out to be cash cows for the companies that produce them, but if you get in on a good one early, there's a dramatic potential for profit.

As you read the press release, consider your impression of what occurred in the quarter. Management might have talked up the company's many ""opportunities"" and relished its past growth. Or it might have outlined the many ""challenges"" facing the company. Management might identify potential catalysts for the business, such as new products or acquisition candidates.

In any case, that language can be as important as the earnings guidance numbers.

The language used in these press releases is very deliberate. It is reviewed by many eyes in the public relations and legal departments. An upbeat report is an especially good sign, while a report containing muted language should be viewed with suspicion.

Finally, look at the stock chart for the last year and last five years.

Are there seasonal variations in the stock price? You may find it routinely trades higher or lower in certain seasons.

Determine the trend this stock is trading in: Is the stock trading above or below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages? Is it a thinly traded stock, or does it trade millions of shares per day? Has the volume recently increased or decreased? A decreasing volume could be a sign of less interest in the shares, which could cause a decline in the share price. Increases are generally favorable if the underlying fundamentals are solid, meaning the company has solid growth opportunities and is well-capitalized.

Beyond the press release, consider the macro trends that might impact the stock. Rising interest rates, higher taxes, or consumer behavior may have an impact on the stock. Other external factors, such as an industry-wide downturn, might affect the company. These considerations can be as important as the fundamentals and technical indicators.

For example, consider Continental Airlines in 2006. The company was in fairly good shape, but higher fuel costs and a number of bankruptcies within the airline industry seemed to be holding the stock back.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ Continental expected to substantially grow its earnings over the next year, but the sector outlook seemed dismal.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ Continental merged with United Airlines in 2010.﻿﻿

By necessity, investors and their brokers often need to analyze companies on the fly and make snap decisions to buy, sell, or hold. Zeroing in on the key information helps them avoid a rash decision.

Of course, to trade or invest you would need a broker. If you don't already have one and are considering which broker to choose, do some research so that you can find a broker to fit your needs.",mainstream
924,"If, on a certain evening about sixty-­six million years ago, you had stood somewhere in North America and looked up at the sky, you would have soon made out what appeared to be a star. If you watched for an hour or two, the star would have seemed to grow in brightness, although it barely moved. That’s because it was not a star but an asteroid, and it was headed directly for Earth at about forty-five thousand miles an hour. Sixty hours later, the asteroid hit. The air in front was compressed and violently heated, and it blasted a hole through the atmosphere, generating a supersonic shock wave. The asteroid struck a shallow sea where the Yucatán peninsula is today. In that moment, the Cretaceous period ended and the Paleogene period began.",mainstream
409,"Is it possible to feel sorry for something that doesn’t exist? If so, then Bigfoot deserves our sympathies.

Tales of Sasquatch or “wild men” have been a part of the American landscape since before there was even an America. Yet, despite decades of searching, there’s still a notable lack of hard evidence the creatures exist at all. Discredited grainy photos and the occasional plaster casting of a footprint don’t count.

But evidence or no, that lack of encouragement sure hasn’t stopped the men of the Gulf Coast Bigfoot Research Organization from devoting their lives to tracking one down and then, upon finding him, filling him full of lead. That’s the dispiriting premise of “Killing Bigfoot,” premiering Friday on Destination America.

Taking place deep in the heart of red-state America, the hourlong special follows a squad of self-appointed Bigfoot hunters, made up of war veterans, ex-lawmen and “hardcore woodsmen,” into the forests of rural Louisiana. Though there’s some talk up front about wanting a Bigfoot specimen to further the cause of science, it’s soon apparent that this show is really about the joy of the hunt.

Let’s just throw out this spoiler warning now: The U.S. government does not end up with its very first official cadaver of a Bigfoot. No worldviews are getting changed here today.

But is it really Bigfoot they’re after? Or the thrill of the hunt? There’s nothing wrong with hunting as a sport. It’s practiced on animals made of much surer flesh and blood than Bigfoot, and it’s clear there’s a certain satisfaction these men get just from the act of tracking, camping and pushing themselves physically out in the heart of Mother Nature.

And if there really is no Bigfoot out there to kill, then what’s the harm? (Yes, this reviewer comes down on the side of skepticism).

But though Bigfoot’s physical presence may be nonexistent, his power as a symbol of the untamed wilderness and the mystique of the great unknown is undeniable. It’s that quest for answers that keeps life interesting, and on some level, it’s what drives these men, just as it drives real scientists the world over.

So why must that drive end in a shotgun blast? Despite multiple so-called eyewitness accounts of Bigfoot encounters in the special, not one person recalls a moment when they were put in physical danger. Frightened? Yes. But fear of the unknown is not reason enough to justify violence.

Lip service is paid to the counter-argument in the special. Several other “Bigfoot experts” argue that hunting down and killing a Bigfoot is not the best way to bring about a clear understanding of a new species. They are correct.

But it’s clear that the special’s heart is not with the joy of discovery so much as the practicalities of hunting. We’re given no view of the inner lives of the squad members, other than each of them recalling a time they were scared by Bigfoot as a child. They were scared, therefore Bigfoot has to die.

But like the ghost hunters on other cable networks, all the buildup comes down to people in the dark swearing to each other they heard something sinister just off camera. It’s a lot of promise with no payoff.

With so little on the line, wouldn’t it be nicer to exult in the mystery than to dwell on the mundane? There are fewer and fewer unknown areas of America these days; maybe we should let Bigfoot roam free. After all, a magical monster is much more fun to consider than a lump of dead meat.",mainstream
1137,"Jason Statham is an English actor who broke into film with 1998's ‘Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels’ and later starred in high-profile action movie franchises, including ‘The Transporter,’ ‘Crank,’ ‘The Expendables’ and ‘The Fast and the Furious.’

English action star Jason Statham has convincingly portrayed a host of unsavory, yet oddly endearing, tough guys (hit men, thieves, con men, assassins, super spies and bodyguards) who can generally be counted on to dish out beat downs and lead car chases while intercutting the action with a well-timed quip. But before he ever stepped foot on a movie set, Statham’s life was just as colorful as the characters he’s played onscreen. From being an Olympic diver to fashion model to even having a side gig in the black market, Statham amassed a unique set of skills that perfectly positioned him to be an action star.

As of 2019, Statham’s net worth is estimated to be around $50 million.

Statham once worked as a con artist, selling fake perfume and stolen jewelry on the streets.

""That was street theater,"" Statham said in a 2007 interview with the Chicago Tribune. ""You work with a team — some people in the crowd, some guys who stand lookout for the police.""

And that’s how he met filmmaker Guy Ritchie, who was fascinated by Statham's past. Ritchie invited him to audition for a part in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. ""Guy had written a character that was the same as me,” Statham said in an interview with Esquire magazine. “And he said, 'I love it. Give me some of the patter.' At the time, I had loads of it. And he was fascinated with that, and he just wanted someone who was authentic.”

So even though Statham had no acting experience or training, Richie cast him as Bacon, a central character who was attempting to make easy money to repay a huge gambling debt.

In his next crime comedy, Snatch (2000), Richie brought Statham on again, this time as a petty criminal named Turkish who tries to make a name for himself in underground boxing. Although the role was originally a minor one — with headline-name actors including Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro, front and center — Statham's role evolved substantially, and he became an unforgettable anti-hero.

'The Transporter,' 'Crank,' 'The Mechanic,' & 'The Expendables'

Luc Besson then cast Statham in the titular role of 2002’s The Transporter, about a driver-for-hire— willing to deliver anything as long as the price is right — until he gets involved in the kidnapping of a young woman who has ties to a dangerous drug ring. The film was a huge hit, which established Statham as an action hero and spawned a sequel in 2005. Statham has also starred in the films Crank and its sequel, as well as The Mechanic and its 2016 sequel. In 2010 he joined the Sylvester Stallone and an all-star cast for The Expendables, The Expendables 2 (2012) and The Expendables 3 (2014).

'The Fast and the Furious' Franchise and 'Hobbs & Shaw'

In 2013 Statham joined an already established action franchise, The Fast and the Furious 6 and in 2017, reprised his role in its eighth installment, The Fate of the Furious. He later paired with his erstwhile screen nemesis Dwayne Johnson for the launch of the spinoff Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw in 2019.

In the 2015 comedy ‘Spy,’ written and directed by Paul Feig, and starring Melissa McCarthy, Jude Law and Rose Byrne, Statham stands out as an anti-James Bond. Though Feig wrote the part of surly agent Rick Ford with Statham in mind, he told Forbes.com he never thought he would accept the role. Staham concedes that he had some hesitation about it. “You never know what you’re getting into with a comedy,” Statham said in an interview with Variety. “But it helps to have a great director and Paul Feig is the Scorsese of comedy films.” Statham is set to reprise his role in the upcoming sequel, Spy 2.

In August 2018, Statham was back in theaters as the star of the sci-fi horror film The Meg, about a 75-foot prehistoric shark that terrorizes a submarine crew. Expected to flop, the film instead proved a surprising hit, taking in $44.5 million at the North American box office and another $97 million overseas during its opening weekend.

Since 1998 Statham has made more than 40 films, almost all of them in the action genre. Yet unlike many action stars, Statham is known for performing the vast majority his stunts. He has also advocated for having stunt performers be included at the Oscars with a designated category.

Jason Statham was born on July 26, 1967 in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, to Eileen and Barry Statham. He had an older brother named Lee and both took interest in martial arts. But Jason had other athletic passions, one of which was diving, and he began working on those skills, eventually becoming a part of the British Olympic Team that traveled to Seoul, Korea in 1988. After the Olympics, he continued as a member of the National Diving Squad for the next decade. However, after some disappointing finishes at the World Championships and Olympic trials, he decided to focus on the next chapter of his career.

A few years later, his athletic build caught the eye of a talent agent and landed Statham a gig in an ad campaign for the European clothing retailer French Connection. An appearance in a Levi's Jeans commercial and work for Hilfiger followed and soon Statham had a modeling career. This helped him land jobs as a background dancer in early '90s music videos like The Shamen's ""Comin' On"" and Erasure's ""Run to the Sun.""

Statham and supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley began dating in 2011, and together, had a son, Jack Oscar, in 2017. The couple got engaged in 2016.",mainstream
606,"A slice of corporate America thinks tea partyers have overstayed their welcome in Washington and should be shown the door in next year's congressional elections. In what could be a sign of challenges to come across the country, two U.S. House races in Michigan mark a turnabout from several years of widely heralded contests in which right-flank candidates have tried sometimes successfully to unseat Republican incumbents they perceive as not being conservative enough. In the Michigan races, longtime Republican businessmen are taking on two House incumbents hard line conservative Reps. Justin Amash and Kerry Bentivolio in GOP primaries. The 16-day partial government shutdown and the threatened national default are bringing to a head a lot of pent-up frustration over GOP insurgents roughing up the business community's agenda.

Democrats hope to use this rift within the GOP to their advantage. Rep. Steve Israel D-N.Y., chairman of the House committee to elect Democrats, insists there's been ""buyer's remorse with House Republicans who have been willing to put the economy at risk,"" and that it is opening the political map for Democrats in 2014. That's what the Democrats would be expected to say. But there's also Defending Main Street, a new GOP-leaning group that's halfway to its goal of raising $8 million. It plans to spend that money on center-right Republicans who face a triumvirate of deep-pocketed conservative groups Heritage Action, Club for Growth and Freedom Works and their preferred, typically tea party candidates. In one race, the group plans to help Idaho eight-term Rep. Mike Simpson, who faces a Club for Growth-backed challenger in a GOP primary.

""These conservative groups have had it all their own way,"" said former Republican Rep. Steve LaTourette of Ohio, head of the new group. ""They basically come in with millions of dollars and big-foot a Republican primary and you wind up with these Manchurian candidates who are not interested in governing."" LaTourette said that for the past three years, some ""40, 42 House members have effectively denied the Republican Party the power of the majority"" that it won in the 2010 election by blocking the GOP agenda. Defending Main Street is meeting Nov. 5 in New York with wealthy potential donors. Call it the wrath of establishment Republicans and corporate America, always considered the best of friends. Since the Republican takeover of the House in 2010, they've watched the GOP insurgents slow a transportation bill and reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, block a treaty governing the high seas and stand in the way of comprehensive immigration legislation.

The final straw was the bitter budget standoff that partly shuttered the government, precipitated by Republicans like Amash and Bentivolio who enlisted early in the campaign demanding that President Barack Obama dismantle his health care law in exchange for keeping the government operating. Even after 16 days of a shutdown, falling poll numbers for the GOP and a threatened economy-jarring default, the two broke with their House Republican leaders and voted against the final deal to reopen the government. Long before the shutdown, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has spent tens of millions boosting mainly Republicans in congressional races, urged the GOP to fund the government and prevent a default, then double back and try and work out changes to the health care law later. A significant number of House Republicans have given a cold-shoulder to the Chamber's agenda. Rob Engstrom, the group's political director, said the Chamber will see how races develop before deciding on its involvement next year.

The latest political dynamic promises to affect the midterm elections but how? Republicans hope the widespread animosity generated by the shutdown dissipates by next November and they can hold their House majority. Currently, Republicans control 231 seats and Democrats 200. Democrats are widely expected to win the special House election in Massachusetts for the seat of Sen. Ed Markey and would need to gain 17 seats next year to seize control. ""As long as we stay focused on the priorities of the American people, I think we're going to be fine,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said last week when asked about whether the GOP can hold onto the House. What about the Michigan races?



In the state's 11th Congressional District, just northwest of Detroit, David Trott, a businessman involved in real estate finance and a member of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce Board of Trustees, is challenging Bentivolio. In the 3rd Congressional District in the southwest part of the state, Brian Ellis is a 53-year-old Grand Rapids businessman who owns an investment advisory firm and serves on the school board. He describes himself as the true conservative Republican in the race, criticizing Amash's votes against Rep. Paul Ryan's budget that cut nearly $5 trillion and a measure reducing taxes for small businesses. Ellis makes it clear that he would have sided with Boehner on the House GOP's last-ditch plan to avoid default. He says it never would have reached that point if Republicans hadn't embraced the tactic of linking the health-care law to government funding.

186,"A bunion is a bony bump that forms at the base of your big toe, where it forms a union with a foot bone called the first metatarsal. Your big toe points excessively toward your second toe when you have a bunion. The bunion is a foot deformity that consists of both bone and soft tissue. Bunions can be very painful. Wearing shoes that are too small or too narrow in the toe area is the most common cause of bunions. This can be thought of as a pressure-response effect. Women are more likely than men to develop bunions. Bunion removal is a surgical procedure that corrects a deformed area of the foot near the big toe. Bunion removal is sometimes called a bunionectomy, bunion surgery, or hallux valgus correction. Hallux valgus is a Latin phrase that means “foot deformity.” A bunion removal is necessary if nonsurgical treatment methods don’t relieve your pain.

Many people get relief from bunion pain by wearing larger shoes with a wider toe box. For example, someone with a bunion might choose to wear athletic shoes instead of high heels for pain relief. Cushioning bunions with protective pads also helps. People who experience pain even after making these lifestyle adjustments may choose bunion removal surgery as an effective treatment method. These scenarios make you an ideal candidate for bunion surgery:
• Your pain restricts or prohibits you from completing everyday routines or activities.
• You can’t walk more than a few blocks without severe foot pain.
• Your big toe remains swollen and painful even with rest and medication.
• You can’t bend or straighten your big toe. Discuss your condition with your doctor so they have complete information about your symptoms and limitations. Your doctor will take X-rays of your foot to diagnose the condition and to determine the kind of surgery needed to correct your specific problem. More than 100 different types of bunion removal procedures exist to remove the bunion and to realign the big toe. The type of surgery you need depends on how your bunion developed and its current size.

You’ll need to undergo a few medical tests to check your overall health before scheduling bunion removal. Your doctor will:
• take an X-ray of your lungs
• perform an electrocardiogram to check your heart function
• test your urine and blood for any underlying illnesses You may need to stop taking medications a few days before surgery, particularly if you take aspirin or other blood-thinning drugs. Bunion removal surgery is usually an outpatient procedure. This means that you can go home a few hours after the operation and after the general anesthesia has worn off. Your doctor will determine how long you should fast, or not eat or drink anything, before the surgery based on your surgery time. Follow their directions carefully to avoid possible complications.

Many people don’t need a general anesthetic during bunion removal surgery. Instead, you’ll get a local anesthetic called an ankle block. An ankle block makes you numb below the ankle, but you’ll be awake for the surgery. Once you’re completely numb, the surgeon will remove the bunion and make other repairs to your foot. Some of the most common types of bunion removal procedures are osteotomy, exostectomy, and arthrodesis.
• In an osteotomy, your surgeon will cut your big toe joint and realign it to a normal position.
• In an exostectomy, your surgeon will remove your bunion from the joint without performing an alignment.
• In an arthrodesis, your surgeon will replace the damaged joint with screws or metal plates to correct the deformity. Your surgeon will bandage your foot after the surgery and take you to the recovery room. Your blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored as you wait for the anesthesia to wear off. Generally, you can go home after a couple of hours in recovery.

While recovery after bunion surgery takes about six to eight weeks, full recovery from bunion removal surgery can take an average of four to six months. For the first two weeks following your surgery, you’ll wear a surgical boot or cast to protect your foot. You should avoid getting your stitches wet. After removing the cast or boot, you’ll wear a brace to support your foot while you heal. You won’t be able to bear weight on your foot at first, and you’ll need crutches for assistance. Gradually, you can start putting some weight on your foot, using a walker or crutches for support. Keep off your feet as much as you can. Ice your foot and toe to speed healing and reduce inflammation. After a week or two, you can drive if necessary. Expect your foot to remain swollen to some degree for several months after bunion removal. Wear shoes with ample room to minimize your pain. Women should try to avoid wearing high heels for at least six months after bunion removal. Your doctor may send you to physical therapy, where you’ll learn exercises that can strengthen your foot and lower leg.",mainstream
518,"Two travellers dubbed Hulk an Big Foot fought each other for 40 minutes in a bid to win a £60,000 prize and defend their warring families.

The huge cash prize saw the men go head to head in a wet, abandoned car park to settle the year-long argument.

Filmed at a “secret location” in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, the fighters, named in the video as Joe Joyce, known as the Hulk, and Patrick Nevin, known as Bigfoot, stepped out in front of a crowd.

The pair end up with blood streaming from their faces and refused to stop fighting, despite multiple requests from the “referees”.

After 40 brutal minutes Patrick Nevin tapped out, leaving Joe Joyce to win by a technical knockout and collect the £60,000 prize money.

According to Harper videos, who filmed the brutal clip, both fighters families fronted £30,000 each.

Mirror Online published a similar video of a fight between different men from the same family.

In this footage the video was uploaded the video to YouTube with the caption: “Joe Joyce vs Patrick Nevin. Gypsy Bare Knuckle Fight BKB Boxing.”

The clip has now had over 70,000 views since it was posted last month.

The footage begins with both men standing in a wet and abandoned car park, surrounded by onlookers.

Joe Joyce, wearing blue shorts, and Patrick Nevin, wearing black and yellow shorts, fight and scrap for over 40 minutes.

At more than one point, the man named as Joe Joyce grabs the man named as Patrick Nevin by the head and lands a series of sickening thuds.

About 20 minutes into the fight the man named as Patrick Nevin already has a burst nose and is bleeding profusely.

The man named as Joe Joyce continues to land a series of sickening blows as he grunts and throws his fists into his opponents face.

The referees try to get the pair to shake hands at multiple points throughout the fight, but both continue to battle on.

At a staggering 40 minutes into the fight, the man named as Patrick Nevin gives up - leaving Joe Joyce to win by a technical knockout.

The man named as Joe Joyce then throws his arms up in the air in celebration, and looks into the camera, with his opponents blood splattered across his hands and chest.

Speaking today, Harper Videos said: “This fight was for the prize money, winner took home £60,000.

""The money was organised as each fighters family gathers £30,000 each and a neutral person holds the full £60,000 and awards it to the winner.

“Joe Joyce Junior, known as the Hulk, fought Patrick Nevin, known as Bigfoot.

“This fight was a feud which started from an argument in a pub, you can find several replies made to each other dating 12 months back.

“Patrick Nevin requested 12 months training for this fight, this is something that has never happened before.

""Joe finally accepted and the fight took place 13 month after the initial argument.

“The fight went on for 41 minutes and it was brutal. Patrick Nevin was badly hurt and finally gave in and admitted defeat so under technical knockout Joe won his fight.

“The both shook hands after the fight and settled their arguments.”",mainstream
863,"Republican Denver Riggleman, author of the book “The Mating Habits of Bigfoot and Why Women Want Him” was elected to the House of Representatives on Tuesday night.

Riggleman won in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, defeating Democrat Leslie Cockburn. Riggleman received 53% of the vote to Cockburn’s 47%.

Riggleman’s book became an issue in the campaign when Cockburn accused him of being a “devotee of Bigfoot erotica.”

Her accusation appears to have stemmed from a Facebook author page, since deleted, for a self-published book by Riggleman.

Riggleman said the book was the product of a running joke between himself and his friends. He told the Washington Post the book was an “anthropological book sort of based on parody and satire.”

“I thought it was funny,” Riggleman said. “There is no way that anybody’s dumb enough to think this is real.”

The story delighted the internet, with many readers learning about the Bigfoot erotica literary genre for the first time. Amazon lists several titles dealing with sexy Sasquatches, including “Bigfoot and the Bridesmaid: Sex with Bigfoot, Book 1,” “Fabulous Beasts and the Women They Grind On” and “Seduced by Bigfoot and Ravaged by the Yeti: The Secret Adventures of a Fertile Housewife.”

Chuck Tingle, a prolific erotica satire author, responded to the controversy by releasing a book called “Don’t Vote For Virginia Congressional Hopeful Denber Wiggleman Because He Is Full Of Hate, Not Because Bigfoot Makes Him Hard.”

Cockburn, a journalist and the mother of actress Olivia Wilde, is herself an author. Her books, none of which feature Bigfoot erotica, include “One Point Safe, the True Story of Russian Nuclear Security” and “Looking for Trouble: One Woman, Six Wars and a Revolution.”",mainstream
675,"From the origin of life to the fate of the universe, there’s plenty scientists simply don’t know. But they are making progress. 2015 has been a great year for science: we’ve seen the agreement of climate deal, pictures of dwarf planets and evidence of flowing water on Mars.

So what will happen in 2016 – are there any major science mysteries that could be solved? We asked three experts to speculate.

1. What’s beyond the ‘standard model’ of physics?

The Large Hadron Collider has already ticked one thing off the list with the discovery of the Higgs Boson in 2012. In 2015, the LHC began Run 2 after a couple of years of upgrades, now smashing protons together at almost double the previous energy. This month, the first experiments revealed a hint of a new particle.

This could be the sign of “super symmetry”, a theory which proposes that there is a heavier super-partner for every particle in the Standard Model (our current best theory of the subatomic world). Super symmetry is important as it could explain many fundamental mysteries of physics, such as what “dark matter” is or the way that the laws of physics appear fine tuned to produce the world around us. However, the new particle could also be a sign of hidden dimensions, a second Higgs boson or – before we get too excited – a false alarm. We will have to wait for more data in 2016 to know for sure.

2. Can we create more elements?

Since the 1930s, scientists have been creating artificial elements by smashing particles together to create new atoms. We now know about 24 synthetic elements taking the periodic table up to the as-yet unnamed element 118. With the recent synthesis of element 117 and the official recognition of the four most recently discovered elements, the remaining gaps in the known periodic table have now been filled.

Scientists are continuing their attempts to extend the table further, trying to make elements 120 and above, though suggestions that element 122 has been discovered seem misplaced. Most recent advances have used the neutron-rich isotope Calcium-48 as a “nuclear bullet” fired into another heavy nucleus to create the new element. Further successes may involve either using an even heavier atom as the bullet rather than a heavier target atom, though it may also depend on the availability of better nuclear accelerators. It is hoped that – unlike most synthetic elements, which decay rapidly – a group of new heavier elements may exist in an “island of stability”.

Dark matter is the mysterious stuff that seems to be everywhere in the universe, and is five times more plentiful than the regular matter that makes up stars, planets and us. Even so, up to now we only have indirect evidence for dark matter through astronomical observations of the gravitational pull it has on stars and galaxies. Until we can make a more direct measurement of it, we won’t know for sure what it is and how it fits in with the standard model of particle physics.

Dedicated experiments such as the Large Underground Xenon experiment (LUX) are reaching new levels of precision as they are trying to directly detect a dark matter candidate known as the “weakly interacting massive particle” as it interacts with ordinary matter on Earth. So 2016 could be the year we finally see this mysterious stuff in the lab.

4. Is there life on Mars (or any other planet)?

On Earth, wherever we find water – whether in the middle of a desert or in hydrothermal vents in the depths of the ocean – we find life. So, it follows that water on another planet means the potential for life there as well. Recent explorations of Mars have dramatically developed our understanding of the planet, showing that it had a watery past and, more recently, that it has flowing salty water.

Alongside the continuing study of Mars, the Juno probe will, in 2016, study how much water there is on Jupiter. Another of our best bets for finding life may be Enceladus (a moon of Saturn). It has an icy crust but was recently found to have geysers spouting water vapour, making it one of the more likely places in the solar system (outside Earth) to contain life.

Just as Maxwell’s equations of electricity and magnetism predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves such as light, Einstein’s theory of general relativity predicts gravitational waves – which are ripples in the fabric of space-time. But even though Einstein’s theory celebrated its centenary in 2015, we have still never seen them. This is mainly because they are so tiny: the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) looks for these waves causing shifts 10,000 times smaller than a proton (which makes up the atomic nucleus together with neutrons) over a distance of four kilometres.

Like the LHC, the LIGO detector came back online in 2015 after a major upgrade, and within a week rumours were flying about a discovery. No official word yet from LIGO themselves, but 2016 could be the year we find Einstein was right again.

Advances in technology mean it is now possible to more carefully seek out rumoured or never-before-discovered animals. Trail cameras or camera “traps” are small cameras that are remotely triggered when an infrared beam is broken and can be left at a site for long periods of time without human involvement. They are increasingly being used in wildlife studies to monitor rare or elusive animals such as the Amur leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis) that was documented in China for the first time in 62 years.

UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) or “drones” are also increasingly being used in wildlife studies to survey inaccessible areas from the sky. For example a Canadian study found that bears are now taking advantage of food sources such as geese and their eggs, possibly as a result of a changing Arctic climate. These UAVs could be flown above a likely habitat of Bigfoot (or any suspected animal) in the hope that we would capture something on camera.",mainstream
934,"""An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin."" —Proverb 21:4

JARS OF CLAY names Jimmy Hendrix and the Beatles as their inspiration (Dann Denny, “Christian Rock,” Sunday Herald Times, Bloomington, Ind., Feb. 8, 1998). The lead guitarist for Jars of Clay is said to be a “Beatles fanatic” (Christian News, Dec. 8, 1997).

Please understand that I don't condemn anyone, for the Bible condemns all of us as guilty, dirty, rotten, hell-deserving sinners. My salvation solely rests in Christ's righteousness, because of the precious blood that He gave for our sins. My intention is not to be unkind; but rather, to expose the falsehood of so-called ""Christian rock.""

When asked by ChristianityToday to list their musical influences, Jars of Clay members “listed no Christian artists” (Christianity Today, Nov. 15, 1999). Jars of Clay performs Ozzy Osbourne’s “Crazy Train” during their concerts. Osbourne is the filthy-mouthed former lead singer for the occultic rock group Black Sabbath. Ozzy Osbourne, has featured Pan on all of his recent album covers (2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008). Sadly, Ozzy is bound for Hell. The Rock 'N' Roll industry is infamous for worshipping Pan, who is the very embodiment of Rock music. Pan represents Satan, which is what the ever-so-popular Satanic hand sign shows, allegiance to the Devil.

Though members of Black Sabbath today claim it was all done in innocence and “fun,” they promoted occultic themes through their music and concerts, including upside down crosses and altar calls for Satan. They blasphemed Jesus Christ and railed against the authority of the God of the Bible. Osbourne has almost died several times because of his outrageous drug abuse and alcoholism. He has bitten the head off of a live bat in concert. He has dressed in women’s clothing and stripped off most of his clothes during concerts. He is deeply scarred by his savage lifestyle and maintains a semblance of normalcy today through the drug Prozac. Ozzy Osbourne's works are of the Devil.

Can you image... a professed Christian group that sings Ozzy Osbourne's hellish music? Just as shocking and tragic is the fact that Christianity Today (CT) magazine promotes Jars of Clay. Why? Do you want to see some freaks?... then look at the website for Jars of Clay. Is this what Christianity has come to? Why would Christianity Today promote such worldly garbage? To no surprise, Christianity Today promotes Harry Potter's witchcraft. CT is also pro-homosexual.

This is Christianity. There is NOTHING even remotely ""Christian"" about the band JARS OF CLAY, and ChristianityToday is apostate. Jars of Clay play the Devil's rock-n-roll, and ChristianityToday sinfully promotes them. It should be renamed to ApostasyToday.

Do you think Jesus Christ is pleased with the worldly, Heavy Metal rock-n-roll of Jars of Clay? No way!!! The Bible warns in 2nd Corinthians 6:14-17... ""Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord..."" It is sinful to hobnob with the Devil's crowd. You can't eat at the Devil's table without getting food poisoning! You can't play with fire without getting burned. DON'T be deceived my friend, ALL rock music is straight out of the pits of Hell. Again, I am not judging anyone; but rather, the apostate music itself.

Shortly before Billy Graham had them perform in his crusades, JARS OF CLAY had ""recorded for an R-rated film loaded with 'live-in' lovers, nudity, graphic violence, and 83 obscenities.[1] The lead vocalist from this band said: ""We don't want to be called a 'Christian band' because it is a turn-off. Jerry Huffman perceptively added: ""Don't worry, we would not accuse it of such.""

Certainly, many believers love the world's music; but we must never attempt to justify it. There's a big difference between a believer who struggles with Rock music, verses someone who tries to say that there's nothing wrong with Rock music. 1st John 2:17 tells us that this world will one day pass away and everything in it (2nd Peter 3:10). The members of STRYPER love secular rock music. In a 1995 interview, Michael Sweet, who was the lead singer for Stryper, said: “I’m a fan of all that stuff from the ‘80s.Groups like Bon Jovi, Van Halen, and Aerosmith. Musically, I like a lot of that stuff, but back when I was a kid what I grew up listening to ranged from Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Fats Domino all the way to groups like Three Dog Night. Credence [Clearwater Revival] was one of my favorite bands and a group called Bad Company. I just loved them and Elvis, of course” (CCM Magazine, November 1995). There's not a dime's difference between the world's rock music, and so-called Christian rock (and Christian rockers admit it!). Some of DC TALK’S musical role models are the Beatles, David Bowie, and The Police, all of which are wicked secular rock groups. dc Talk’s album “Free at Last” contains a song titled “Jesus Is Just Alright,” which was first sung by the Byrds (the song was later covered by the Doobie Brothers; a “doobie” is a marijuana joint). DC Talk’s Kevin Smith admits that he listens to mostly secular rock music (Flint Michigan Journal, March 15, 1996, B19). dc Talk opened its “Jesus Freak” concerts with the Beatles’ song “Help.” They also perform Jimi Hendrix’s Purple Haze. Hendrix was a drug-crazed New Age occultist. Toward the end of their concerts dc Talk plays the rock song “All Apologies” by the wicked secular rock group Nirvana, formerly led by Kurt Cobain. Terry Watkins notes: “Kurt Cobain is one of the worst Antichrist, blasphemers since John Lennon. Kurt Cobain decorated his home with blood-splattered baby dolls hanging by their necks! The inside of Nirvana’s album In Utero, which is the album dc Talk got ‘All Apologies’ from, has pictures of chopped up babies! Cobain ran around his neighborhood spray-painting, ‘ABORT CHRIST’ and ‘GOD IS GAY.’ Cobain’s first band was called ‘Fecal Matter.’ Cobain killed himself a couple of years ago” (Dr. Watkins, Christian Rock: Blessing or Blasphemy?) Jars of Clay has a less commercial sound that appeals to ""alternative rock"" fans drawn to groups like R.E.M. or Matchbox Twenty. The band has enjoyed some crossover success in the secular market. So much for being a so-called “Christian” group! Their first album went double platinum with astonishing sales of over 2 million copies (making it one of the best-selling albums of 1996). The band’s third disc was chosen by Playboy as Album of the Month. This is just sickening! These phonies call themselves “Christians” and yet sing the Devil's music, open concerts for Satanist Ozzy Osbourne, and are praised by the smutty PLAYBOY magazine. Jars of Clay are of the Devil. Birds of a feather flock together. AMY GRANT says, “I love to hear Billy Joel, Kenny Loggins and the Doobie Brothers” (Time, March 11, 1985). Amy’s album House of Love includes the environmental-mother-earth song, “Big Yellow Taxi,” by new-age-priestess Joni Mitchell (Ibid.). Mitchell is infamous for her open relationship with a spirit she calls “Art.” Obviously she is communing with demons, and it is unconscionable for Amy Grant to be promoting Mitchell’s music to Christian young people. I'm not judging Amy Grant, for I like Billy Joel's music too; but I'm not going to dare say that there's nothing wrong with it. God deliver our young people from these materialistic, worldly, deceitful, wicked imposters who EXPLOIT the name of Jesus to make a buck and corrupt America's youth. The world has no place in the New Testament Church. This means that Relient K, Toby Mac, Avalon, Jeremy Camp, Dead Poetic, Demon Hunter, Newsboys, Whitecross, MxPx, Third Day, Passion, Delirious, Bride, The Almost, Disciple, Kutless, Inhale/Exhale, PFR, Emery, Robert Pierre, Chris Tomlin, Marsha Stevens, Further Seems Forever, Switchfoot, Soul P., New Life Worship, DC talk, Echoing Angels, Matt Redman, Katinas, Michael W. Smith, Lincoln Brewster, GRITS, Geoff Moore The Distance, Thousand Foot Krutch, Steven Curtis Chapman, Mercy Me, and Jars of Clay... HAVE NO BUSINESS BRINGING THEIR WORKS OF DARKNESS INTO ANY NEW TESTAMENT CHURCH! To be a friend of the world is to be the enemy of God (James 4:4). ""Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever."" —1st John 2:15-17",conspiracy
977,"The state-of-the-art craft which transported the vaccine, travelled nearly 40 kilometres over rugged mountain terrain, flying from Dillon’s Bay in western Vanuatu to remote Cook’s Bay – a scattered community accessible only on foot or by small boats – where 13 children and 5 pregnant women were inoculated by a nurse.

Henrietta H. Fore, the Executive Director of UNICEF said the tiny aircraft’s flight “is a big leap for global health.”

“With the world still struggling to immunize the hardest-to-reach children, drone technologies can be a game changer for bridging that last mile to reach every child,” she added.

Vaccines are extremely difficult to transport as they need to be carried at closely controlled temperatures, a particular challenge in warm places such as like Vanuatu, which is made up of more than 80 remote, mountainous islands stretching across 1,300 kilometres, with only limited road networks.

As a result, almost 20 per cent of the country’s children miss out on these essential vaccines.

Nurse Miriam Nampil, who administrated the vaccine to the children in Cook’s Bay highlighted these challenges: “It’s extremely hard to carry ice boxes to keep the vaccines cool while walking across rivers, mountains, through the rain, or across rocky ledges. I’ve relied on boats, which often get cancelled due to bad weather.”

“As the journey is often long and difficult, I can only go there once a month to vaccinate children. But now, with these drones, we can hope to reach many more children in the remotest areas of the island,” she added.

Drone payload only two metres off target

The effectiveness of employing drones for such critical delivers was confirmed last week.

In a test flight carried out by the island’s Ministry of Health with UNICEF support, the drone -flown by an Australian company - landed the payloads within just two meters of the target after a 50-km flight over numerous islands and way points.

When it came to the actual flight, the vaccines were carried in Styrofoam boxes with ice-packs and a temperature logger, programmed to trigger an alert should the vaccine temperature swing out of acceptable range.

The delivery is also the first time ever, that a Government has contracted a commercial drone company to transport vaccines to remote areas. The operator was selected after a bidding process, and as per the contract, they are held accountable and not paid if they don’t deliver.

In the long term, the Government of Vanuatu is seeking to integrate vaccine delivery by drones into their national immunization programme and plans to use drones more widely to distribute health supplies, according to UNICEF.

The data from the trials will also be used to show how drones can be used commercially in similar settings around the world.

“Today’s first-of-a-kind vaccine delivery has enormous potential not only for Vanuatu, but also for the thousands of children who are missing out on vaccines across the world,” explained UNICEF head Fore.

“This is innovation at its best and shows how we can unlock the potential of the private sector for the greater good of the world’s children.”",mainstream
1326,"The Hominidae ( ), whose members are known as great apes[note 1] or hominids ( ), are a taxonomic family of primates that includes eight extant species in four genera: Pongo, the Bornean, Sumatran and Tapanuli orangutan; Gorilla, the eastern and western gorilla; Pan, the common chimpanzee and the bonobo; and Homo, of which only modern humans remain.[1]

Several revisions in classifying the great apes have caused the use of the term ""hominid"" to vary over time. The original meaning of ""hominid"" referred only to humans (Homo) and their closest extinct relatives. That restrictive meaning has now been largely assumed by the term ""hominin"", which comprises all members of the human clade after the split from the chimpanzees (Pan). The current, 21st-century meaning of ""hominid"" includes all the great apes including humans. Usage still varies, however, and some scientists and laypersons still use ""hominid"" in the original restrictive sense; the scholarly literature generally shows the traditional usage until around the turn of the 21st century.[4]

Within the taxon Hominidae, a number of extant and known extinct, that is, fossil, genera are grouped with the humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas in the subfamily Homininae; others with orangutans in the subfamily Ponginae (see classification graphic below). The most recent common ancestor of all Hominidae lived roughly 14 million years ago,[5] when the ancestors of the orangutans speciated from the ancestral line of the other three genera.[6] Those ancestors of the family Hominidae had already speciated from the family Hylobatidae (the gibbons), perhaps 15 to 20 million years ago.[6][7]

Due to the close genetic relationship between humans and the other great apes, certain animal rights organizations, such as the Great Ape Project, argue that nonhuman great apes are persons and should be given basic human rights. 29 countries have already instituted a research ban to protect great apes from any kind of scientific testing.

In the early Miocene, about 22 million years ago, there were many species of arboreally adapted primitive catarrhines from East Africa; the variety suggests a long history of prior diversification. Fossils at 20 million years ago include fragments attributed to Victoriapithecus, the earliest Old World monkey. Among the genera thought to be in the ape lineage leading up to 13 million years ago are Proconsul, Rangwapithecus, Dendropithecus, Limnopithecus, Nacholapithecus, Equatorius, Nyanzapithecus, Afropithecus, Heliopithecus, and Kenyapithecus, all from East Africa.

At sites far distant from East Africa, the presence of other generalized non-cercopithecids, that is, non-monkey primates, of middle Miocene age—Otavipithecus from cave deposits in Namibia, and Pierolapithecus and Dryopithecus from France, Spain and Austria—is further evidence of a wide diversity of ancestral ape forms across Africa and the Mediterranean basin during the relatively warm and equable climatic regimes of the early and middle Miocene. The most recent of these far-flung Miocene apes (hominoids) is Oreopithecus, from the fossil-rich coal beds in northern Italy and dated to 9 million years ago.

Molecular evidence indicates that the lineage of gibbons (family Hylobatidae), the lesser apes, diverged from that of the great apes some 18–12 million years ago, and that of orangutans (subfamily Ponginae) diverged from the other great apes at about 12 million years. There are no fossils that clearly document the ancestry of gibbons, which may have originated in a still-unknown South East Asian hominoid population; but fossil proto-orangutans, dated to around 10 million years ago, may be represented by Sivapithecus from India and Griphopithecus from Turkey.[8]

Species close to the last common ancestor of gorillas, chimpanzees and humans may be represented by Nakalipithecus fossils found in Kenya and Ouranopithecus found in Greece. Molecular evidence suggests that between 8 and 4 million years ago, first the gorillas (genus Gorilla), and then the chimpanzees (genus Pan) split off from the line leading to the humans. Human DNA is approximately 98.4% identical to that of chimpanzees when comparing single nucleotide polymorphisms (see human evolutionary genetics).[9] The fossil record, however, of gorillas and chimpanzees is limited; both poor preservation—rain forest soils tend to be acidic and dissolve bone—and sampling bias probably contribute most to this problem.

Other hominins probably adapted to the drier environments outside the African equatorial belt; and there they encountered antelope, hyenas, elephants and other forms becoming adapted to surviving in the East African savannas, particularly the regions of the Sahel and the Serengeti. The wet equatorial belt contracted after about 8 million years ago, and there is very little fossil evidence for the divergence of the hominin lineage from that of gorillas and chimpanzees—which split was thought to have occurred around that time. The earliest fossils argued by some to belong to the human lineage are Sahelanthropus tchadensis (7 Ma) and Orrorin tugenensis (6 Ma), followed by Ardipithecus (5.5–4.4 Ma), with species Ar. kadabba and Ar. ramidus.

The classification of the great apes has been revised several times in the last few decades; these revisions have led to a varied use of the word ""hominid"" over time. The original meaning of the term referred to only humans and their closest relatives—what is now the modern meaning of the term ""hominin"". The meaning of the taxon Hominidae changed gradually, leading to a modern usage of ""hominid"" that includes all the great apes including humans.

A number of very similar words apply to related classifications:
• A hominoid, sometimes called an ape, is a member of the superfamily Hominoidea: extant members are the gibbons (lesser apes, family Hylobatidae) and the hominids.
• A hominid is a member of the family Hominidae, the great apes: orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees and humans.
• A hominine is a member of the subfamily Homininae: gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans (excludes orangutans).
• A hominin is a member of the tribe Hominini: chimpanzees and humans.[10]
• A homininan, following a suggestion by Wood and Richmond (2000), would be a member of the subtribe Hominina of the tribe Hominini: that is, modern humans and their closest relatives, including Australopithecina, but excluding chimpanzees.[11][12]
• A human is a member of the genus Homo, of which Homo sapiens is the only extant species, and within that Homo sapiens sapiens is the only surviving subspecies.

As mentioned, Hominidae was originally the name given to the family of humans and their (extinct) close relatives, with the other great apes (that is, the orangutans, gorillas and chimpanzees) all being placed in a separate family, the Pongidae. However, that definition eventually made Pongidae paraphyletic because at least one great ape species (the chimpanzees) proved to be more closely related to humans than to other great apes. Most taxonomists today encourage monophyletic groups—this would require, in this case, the use of Pongidae to be restricted to just one closely related grouping. Thus, many biologists now assign Pongo (as the subfamily Ponginae) to the family Hominidae. The taxonomy shown here follows the monophyletic groupings according to the modern understanding of human and great ape relationships.

Humans and close relatives including the tribes Hominini and Gorillini form the subfamily Homininae (see classification graphic below). (A few researchers go so far as to refer the chimpanzees and the gorillas to the genus Homo along with humans.)[13][14][15] But, it is those fossil relatives more closely related to humans than the chimpanzees that represent the especially close members of the human family, and without necessarily assigning subfamily or tribal categories.[16]

Many extinct hominids have been studied to help understand the relationship between modern humans and the other extant hominids. Some of the extinct members of this family include Gigantopithecus, Orrorin, Ardipithecus, Kenyanthropus, and the australopithecines Australopithecus and Paranthropus.[17]

The exact criteria for membership in the tribe Hominini under the current understanding of human origins are not clear, but the taxon generally includes those species that share more than 97% of their DNA with the modern human genome, and exhibit a capacity for language or for simple cultures beyond their 'local family' or band. The theory of mind concept—including such faculties as empathy, attribution of mental state, and even empathetic deception—is a controversial criterion; it distinguishes the adult human alone among the hominids. Humans acquire this capacity after about four years of age, whereas it has not been proven (nor has it been disproven) that gorillas or chimpanzees ever develop a theory of mind.[18] This is also the case for some New World monkeys outside the family of great apes, as, for example, the capuchin monkeys.

However, even without the ability to test whether early members of the Hominini (such as Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis, or even the australopithecines) had a theory of mind, it is difficult to ignore similarities seen in their living cousins. Orangutans have shown the development of culture comparable to that of chimpanzees,[19] and some[who?] say the orangutan may also satisfy those criteria for the theory of mind concept. These scientific debates take on political significance for advocates of great ape personhood.

Below is a cladogram with extinct species.[20][21][22][failed verification] It is indicated approximately how many million years ago (Mya) the clades diverged into newer clades.[23]

There are eight living species of great ape which are classified in four genera. The following classification is commonly accepted:[1]
• Family Hominidae: humans and other great apes; extinct genera and species excluded[1]

In addition to the extant species and subspecies, archaeologists, paleontologists, and anthropologists have discovered and classified numerous extinct great ape species as below, based on the taxonomy shown.[25]
• Subfamily Homininae[27][28]
• Tribe Hominini
• Subtribe Hominina
• Homo – close relatives of modern humans
• Homo georgicus† (thought by some to be an early subspecies of Homo erectus)
• Homo ergaster† (considered by some to be an early subspecies of Homo erectus)
• Denisovans (scientific name not yet assigned)†
• Homo sapiens
• Red Deer Cave people † (scientific name has not yet been assigned; perhaps a race of modern humans or a hybrid[31] of modern humans and Denisovans[32])

The great apes are tailless primates, with the smallest living species being the bonobo at 30–40 kilograms in weight, and the largest being the eastern gorillas, with males weighing 140–180 kilograms. In all great apes, the males are, on average, larger and stronger than the females, although the degree of sexual dimorphism varies greatly among species. Although most living species are predominantly quadrupedal, they are all able to use their hands for gathering food or nesting materials, and, in some cases, for tool use.[33]

Most species are omnivorous,[citation needed] but fruit is the preferred food among all but some human groups. Chimpanzees and orangutans primarily eat fruit. When gorillas run short of fruit at certain times of the year or in certain regions, they resort to eating shoots and leaves, often of bamboo, a type of grass. Gorillas have extreme adaptations for chewing and digesting such low-quality forage, but they still prefer fruit when it is available, often going miles out of their way to find especially preferred fruits. Humans, since the neolithic revolution, consume mostly cereals and other starchy foods, including increasingly highly processed foods, as well as many other domesticated plants (including fruits) and meat. Hominid teeth are similar to those of the Old World monkeys and gibbons, although they are especially large in gorillas. The dental formula is 2.1.2.32.1.2.3. Human teeth and jaws are markedly smaller for their size than those of other apes, which may be an adaptation to not only having supplanted with extensive tool use the role of jaws in hunting and fighting, but also eating cooked food since the end of the Pleistocene.[34][35]

Gestation in great apes lasts 8–9 months, and results in the birth of a single offspring, or, rarely, twins. The young are born helpless, and require care for long periods of time. Compared with most other mammals, great apes have a remarkably long adolescence, not being weaned for several years, and not becoming fully mature for eight to thirteen years in most species (longer in orangutans and humans). As a result, females typically give birth only once every few years. There is no distinct breeding season.[33]

The gorillas and the chimpanzee live in family groups of around five to ten individuals, although much larger groups are sometimes noted. Chimpanzees live in larger groups that break up into smaller groups when fruit becomes less available. When small groups of female chimpanzees go off in separate directions to forage for fruit, the dominant males can no longer control them and the females often mate with other subordinate males. In contrast, groups of gorillas stay together regardless of the availability of fruit. When fruit is hard to find, they resort to eating leaves and shoots. Because gorilla groups stay together, the male is able to monopolize the females in his group. This fact is related to gorillas' greater sexual dimorphism relative to that of chimpanzees; that is, the difference in size between male and female gorillas is much greater than that between male and female chimpanzees. This enables gorilla males to physically dominate female gorillas more easily. In both chimpanzees and gorillas, the groups include at least one dominant male, and young males leave the group at maturity.

Due to the close genetic relationship between humans and the other great apes, certain animal rights organizations, such as the Great Ape Project, argue that nonhuman great apes are persons and should be given basic human rights. In 1999, New Zealand was the first country to ban any great ape experimentation, and now 29 countries have currently instituted a research ban to protect great apes from any kind of scientific testing.

On 25 June 2008, the Spanish parliament supported a new law that would make ""keeping apes for circuses, television commercials or filming"" illegal.[36] On 8 September 2010, the European Union banned the testing of great apes.[37]

612,"At many airport newsstands, transients on their way to destinations unknown tend to pick up things they can use on the trip—mainly bottled water and neck pillows. Yet around the country, passengers are also making room in their carry-ons for mustard, popcorn and pink headphones, among other surprising items. As airports around the country sharpen their focus on customer satisfaction and increase their reliance on income from food and beverage, specialty retail and other non-aeronautical revenue, concourses are getting more comfortable and shop offerings are becoming more creative. From gourmet sweets to sportswear and even vinyl records, CNBC recently canvassed major U.S. airports to find out their best-selling items—and the results were both surprising and wide ranging.

At Denver International Airport, almond toffee made in nearby Grand Junction by Enstrom Coffee & Confectionary is a top seller, while at the gourmet 1897 Market at Charlotte Douglas International Airport, locally-made Sweet Girl Cookies and Queen Charlotte's Original Pimento Cheese are customer favorites. Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport does a brisk business in ""scorpion suckers"" (hard candy with a scorpion in the center), and racks up a million dollars in sales of cactus plants each year. ""We have a variety of different shapes and sizes packaged so that travelers can take one home with them,"" said Heather Lissner, spokeswoman for the Aviation Department of the City of Phoenix, ""We also offer a petting cactus, which is easy to touch compared to the other varieties.""

Flying Pig products—which include pig-themed hats, stuffed animals, accessories and bags of Pig Poop (chocolate covered peanuts)—sell briskly in the shops at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.

 Why flying pigs? During the mid-to-late 1800s, Cincinnati was the largest pork processing center in the country, earning itself nickname 'Porkopolis.' Winged pigs are one way the city embraces its past. Speaking of pigs, San Francisco International Airport (which recently added a pig to its team of therapy animals that visit with passengers) sells locally-made Candied Bacon Caramel Corn from Chunky Pig that's said to be flying off the shelves at the Skyline News Shop in Terminal 3.

At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, Garrett Popcorn, a modern hometown favorite, is a perennial top seller. Combined, the two Garrett Popcorn Shops at O'Hare sold more than 47,000 one-gallon tins of popcorn (assorted varieties) during 2016, at an average price of $34.50 a tin, said Gregg Cunningham of the Chicago Department of Aviation.

 Sweet Beginnings Honey, made by bees at the airport's apiary, also sells well at the O'Hare Famers Market. Something for the sports nuts

During February alone, the shops at Norman Mineta San Jose International sold more than 15,000 bottles of water, more than 200 Belkin phone chargers and—as one can imagine—and equal number of Golden State Warriors and Steph Curry-branded clothing. As it happens, sports-related merchandise is a big seller at other airports as well, especially when teams and players are winning. Cleveland Hopkins International Airport sells lots of sports memorabilia, but also moves around 40 cases of locally made ballpark-style mustard each month. Both Stadium and Bertman brand mustards are sold at the airport, with Stadium outselling Bertman by 15 to 20 percent, Airmall reports.

 Carpeting for your feet, and records

Sasquatch and Big Foot-branded items are popular right now at the Made in Oregon stores at Portland International Airport. Store manager Candace Vincent said the airport stores sold more than $1 million of carpet-themed products over the last two years, based on the airport's formerly iconic teal flooring. And at Newark Liberty International Airport, travelers have been snapping up vinyl records from the shop at CBGB L.A.B (lounge and bar) operated by OTG in Terminal C. ""We don't report volumes, but I can tell you it's the top seller in that retail concept,"" said Eric Brinker, an OTG vice president. ""People are buying record players in the shop as well."" In Houston, where OTG is working with United Airlines to redo the dining and retail offerings in its terminals at George Bush Intercontinental Airport, there's also a surprising best-seller. ""We sell tons of headphones in Houston,"" said Brinker, ""And for some reason we sell more pink headphones in Texas than in any other place in the country.""",mainstream
519,"Sawfishes, also known as carpenter sharks, are a family of rays characterized by a long, narrow, flattened rostrum, or nose extension, lined with sharp transverse teeth, arranged in a way that resembles a saw. They are among the largest fish with some species reaching lengths of about 7–7.6 m (23–25 ft).[2] They are found worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions in coastal marine and brackish estuarine waters, as well as freshwater rivers and lakes.[3]

They should not be confused with sawsharks (order Pristiophoriformes) or the extinct sclerorhynchids (order Sclerorhynchiformes) which have a similar appearance, or swordfish (family Xiphiidae) which have a similar name but a very different appearance.[1][4]

Sawfishes are relatively slow breeders and the females give birth to live young.[2] They feed on fish and invertebrates that are detected and captured with the use of their saw.[5] They are generally harmless to humans, but can inflict serious injuries with the saw when captured and defending themselves.[6]

Sawfish have been known and hunted for thousands of years,[7] and play an important mythological and spiritual role in many societies around world.[8]

Once common, sawfish have experienced a drastic decline in recent decades, and the only remaining strongholds are in Northern Australia and Florida, United States.[4][9] The five species are rated as Endangered or Critically Endangered by the IUCN.[10] They are hunted for their fins (shark fin soup), use of parts as traditional medicine, their teeth and saw. They also face habitat loss.[4] Sawfish have been listed by CITES since 2007, restricting international trade in them and their parts.[11][12] They are protected in Australia, the United States and several other countries, meaning that sawfish caught by accident have to be released and violations can be punished with hefty fines.[13][14]

The scientific names of the sawfish family Pristidae and its type genus Pristis are derived from the Ancient Greek: πρίστης, prístēs, 'saw, sawyer'.[15][16]

Despite their appearance, sawfish are rays (superorder Batoidea). The sawfish family has traditionally been considered the sole living member of the order Pristiformes, but recent authorities have generally subsumed it into Rhinopristiformes, an order that now includes the sawfish family, as well as families containing guitarfish, wedgefish, banjo rays and the like.[17][18] Sawfish quite resemble guitarfish, except that the latter group lacks a saw, and their common ancestor likely was similar to guitarfish.[5]

The species level taxonomy in the sawfish family has historically caused considerable confusion and was often described as chaotic.[7] Only in 2013 was it firmly established that there are five living species in two genera.[4][19]

Anoxypristis contains a single living species that historically was included in Pristis, but the two genera are morphologically and genetically highly distinct.[1][20] Today Pristis contains four living, valid species divided into two species groups. Three species are in the smalltooth group, and there is only a single in the largetooth group.[4] Three poorly defined species were formerly recognized in the largetooth group, but in 2013 it was shown that P. pristis, P. microdon and P. perotteti do not differ in morphology or genetics.[19] As a consequence, recent authorities treat P. microdon and P. perotteti as junior synonyms of P. pristis.[3][21][22][23][24][25]

In addition to the living sawfish, there are several extinct species that only are known from fossil remains. The oldest known is the monotypic genus Peyeria where the remains are about 100 million years old from the Cenomanian age (Late Cretaceous),[1] though it may represent a rhinid rather than a sawfish.[27] Indisputable sawfish genera emerged in the Cenozoic age about 60 million years ago, relatively soon after the Cretaceous–Paleogene mass extinction. Among these are Propristis, a monotypic genus only known from fossil remains, as well as several extinct Pristis species and several extinct Anoxypristis species (both of these genera are also represented by living species).[1][28] Historically, palaeontologists have not separated Anoxypristis from Pristis.[1] In contrast, several additional extinct genera are occasionally listed, including Dalpiazia, Onchopristis, Oxypristis,[29] and Mesopristis,[28] but recent authorities generally include the first two in the family Sclerorhynchidae and the last two are synonyms of Anoxypristis.[1][30] Fossils of sawfish have been found around the world in all continents.[29]

The extinct family Sclerorhynchidae resemble sawfish. They are known only from Cretaceous fossils,[1][31] and usually reached lengths only of approximately 1 m (3.3 ft).[5][27] Some have suggested that sawfish and sclerorhynchids form a clade, the Pristiorajea,[31] while others believe the groups are not particularly close, making the proposed clade polyphyletic.[27]

Sawfish are dull brownish, greyish, greenish or yellowish above,[2] but the shade varies and dark individuals can be almost black.[32] The underside is pale,[32] and typically whitish.[2]

The most distinctive feature of sawfish is their saw-like rostrum with a row of whitish teeth (rostral teeth) on either side of it. The rostrum is an extension of the chondrocranium (""skull""),[27] made of cartilage and covered in skin.[33] The rostrum length is typically about one-quarter to one-third of the total length of the fish,[5] but it varies depending on species, and sometimes with age and sex.[1] The rostral teeth are not teeth in the traditional sense, but heavily modified dermal denticles.[34] The rostral teeth grow in size throughout the life of the sawfish and a tooth is not replaced if it is lost.[34][35] In Pristis sawfish the teeth are found along the entire length of the rostrum, but in adult Anoxypristis there are no teeth on the basal one-quarter of the rostrum (about one-sixth in juvenile Anoxypristis).[36][37] The number of teeth varies depending on the species and can range from 14 to 37 on each side of the rostrum.[2][38][note 1] It is common for a sawfish to have slightly different tooth counts on each side of its rostrum (difference typically does not surpass three).[39][40] In some species, females on average have fewer teeth than males.[1][39] Each tooth is peg-like in Pristis sawfish, and flattened and broadly triangular in Anoxypristis.[2] A combination of features, including fins and rostrum, are typically used to separate the species,[2][38] but it is possible to do it by the rostrum alone.[41]

Sawfish have a strong shark-like body, a flat underside and a flat head. Pristis sawfish have a rough sandpaper-like skin texture because of the covering of dermal denticles, but in Anoxypristis the skin is largely smooth.[2] The mouth and nostrils are placed on the underside of the head.[2] There are about 88–128 small, blunt-edged teeth in the upper jaw of the mouth and about 84–176 in the lower jaw (not to be confused with the teeth on the saw). These are arranged in 10–12 rows on each jaw,[42] and somewhat resemble a cobblestone road.[43] They have small eyes and behind each is a spiracle, which is used to draw water past the gills.[44] The gill slits, five on each side, are placed on the underside of the body near the base of the pectoral fins.[43] The position of the gill openings separates them from the superficially similar, but generally much smaller (up to 1.5 m or 5 ft long) sawsharks, where the slits are placed on the side of the neck.[1][45] Unlike sawfish, sawsharks also have a pair of long barbels on the rostrum (""saw"").[1][45]

Sawfish have two relatively high and distinct dorsal fins, wing-like pectoral and pelvic fins, and a tail with a distinct upper lobe and a variably sized lower lobe (lower lobe relatively large in Anoxypristis; small to absent in Pristis sawfish).[2] The position of the first dorsal fin compared to the pelvic fins varies and is a useful feature for separating some of the species.[2] There are no anal fins.[42]

Like other elasmobranches, sawfish lack a swim bladder (instead controlling their buoyancy with a large oil-rich liver), have a skeleton consisting of cartilage,[46] and the males have claspers, a pair of elongated structures used for mating and positioned on the underside at the pelvic fins.[42] The claspers are small and indistinct in young males.[38]

Their small intestines contain an internal partition shaped like a corkscrew, called a spiral valve, which increases the surface area available for food absorption.[citation needed]

Sawfish are large to very large fish, but the maximum size of each species is generally uncertain. The smalltooth sawfish, largetooth sawfish and green sawfish are among the world's largest fish. They can certainly all reach about 6 m (20 ft) in total length and there are reports of individuals larger than 7 m (23 ft), but these are often labeled with some uncertainty.[2] Typically reported maximum total lengths of these three are from 7 to 7.6 m (23–25 ft).[2] Large individuals may weigh as much as 500–600 kg (1,102–1,323 lb),[47] or possibly even more.[48][49] Old unconfirmed and highly questionable reports of much larger individuals do exist, including one that reputedly had a length of 9.14 m (30 ft), another that had a weight of 2,400 kg (5,300 lb), and a third that was 9.45 m (31 ft) long and weighed 2,591 kg (5,712 lb).[48]

The two remaining species, the dwarf sawfish and narrow sawfish, are considerably smaller, but are still large fish with a maximum total length of at least 3.2 m (10.5 ft) and 3.5 m (11.5 ft) respectively.[2][50] In the past it was often reported that the dwarf sawfish only reaches about 1.4 m (4.6 ft), but this is now known to be incorrect.[51]

Sawfish are found worldwide in tropical and subtropical waters.[3]

Historically they ranged in the East Atlantic from Morocco to South Africa,[52] and in the West Atlantic from New York (United States)[32] to Uruguay, including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.[3] There are old reports (last in the late 1950s or shortly after) from the Mediterranean and these have typically been regarded as vagrants,[3] but a review of records strongly suggests that this sea had a breeding population.[53] In the East Pacific they ranged from Mazatlán (Mexico) to northern Peru.[54] Although the Gulf of California occasionally has been included in their range, the only known Pacific Mexican records of sawfish are from south of its mouth.[54] They were widespread in the western and central Indo-Pacific, ranging from South Africa to the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, east and north to Korea and southern Japan, through Southeast Asia to Papua New Guinea and Australia.[3] Today sawfish have disappeared from much of their historical range.[3]

Sawfish are primarily found in coastal marine and estuarine brackish waters, but they are euryhaline (can adapt to various salinities) and also found in freshwater.[2] The largetooth sawfish, alternatively called the freshwater sawfish, has the greatest affinity for freshwater.[55] For example, it has been reported as far as 1,340 km (830 mi) up the Amazon River and in Lake Nicaragua, and its young spend the first years of their life in freshwater.[21] In contrast, the smalltooth, green and dwarf sawfish typically avoid pure freshwater, but may occasionally move far up rivers, especially during periods when there is an increased salinity.[51][56][57] There are reports of narrow sawfish seen far upriver, but these need confirmation and may involve misidentifications of other species of sawfish.[58]

Sawfish are mostly found in relatively shallow waters, typically at depths less than 10 m (33 ft),[3] and occasionally less than 1 m (3.3 ft).[56] Young prefer very shallow places and are often found in water only 25 cm (10 in) deep.[4] Sawfish can occur offshore, but are rare deeper than 100 m (330 ft).[3] An unidentified sawfish (either a largetooth or smalltooth sawfish) was captured off Central America at a depth in excess of 175 m (575 ft).[59]

The dwarf and largetooth sawfish are strictly warm-water species that generally live in waters that are 25–32 °C (77–90 °F) and 24–32 °C (75–90 °F) respectively.[51][55] The green and smalltooth sawfish also occur in colder waters, in the latter down to 16–18 °C (61–64 °F), as illustrated by their (original) distributions that ranged further north and south of the strictly warm-water species.[55][60] Sawfish are bottom-dwellers, but in captivity it has been noted that at least the largetooth and green sawfish readily take food from the water surface.[55] Sawfish are mostly found in places with soft bottoms such as mud or sand, but may also occur over hard rocky bottoms or at coral reefs.[61] They are often found in areas with seagrass or mangrove.[3]

Sawsharks are typically found much deeper, often at depths in excess of 200 m (660 ft), and when shallower mostly in colder subtropical or temperate waters than sawfish.[1][45]

Relatively little is known about the reproductive habits of the sawfish, but all species are ovoviviparous with the adult females giving birth to live young once a year or every second year.[3] In general, males appear to reach sexual maturity at a slightly younger age and smaller size than females.[3] As far as known, sexual maturity is reached at an age of 7–12 years in Pristis and 2–3 years in Anoxypristis. In the smalltooth and green sawfish this equals a total length of 3.7–4.15 m (12.1–13.6 ft), in the largetooth sawfish at 2.8–3 m (9.2–9.8 ft), in the dwarf sawfish about 2.55–2.6 m (8.4–8.5 ft), and in the narrow sawfish at 2–2.25 m (6.6–7.4 ft).[3] This means that the generation length is about 4.6 years in the narrow sawfish and 14.6–17.2 years in the remaining species.[3]

Mating involves the male inserting a clasper, organs at the pelvic fins, into the female to fertilize the eggs.[33] As known from many elasmobranchs, the mating appears to be rough, with the sawfish often sustaining lacerations from its partner's saw.[62] However, through genetic testing it has been shown that at least the smalltooth sawfish also can reproduce by parthenogenesis where no male is involved and the offspring are clones of their mother.[63][64] In Florida, United States, it appears that about 3% of the smalltooth sawfish offspring are the result of parthenogenesis.[65] It is speculated that this may be in response to being unable to find a partner, allowing the females to reproduce anyway.[64][65]

The pregnancy lasts several months.[33] There are 1–23 young in each sawfish litter, which are 60–90 cm (2–3 ft) long at birth.[3][33] In the embryos the rostrum is flexible and it only hardens shortly before birth.[33] To protect the mother the saws of the young have a soft cover, which falls off shortly after birth.[66][67] The pupping grounds are in coastal and estuarine waters. In most species the young generally stay there for the first part of their lives, occasionally moving upriver when there is an increase in salinity.[51][56][57][68] The exception is the largetooth sawfish where the young move upriver into freshwater where they stay for 3–5 years, sometimes as much as 400 km (250 mi) from the sea.[59] In at least the smalltooth sawfish the young show a degree of site fidelity, generally staying in the same fairly small area in the first part of their lives.[69] In the green and dwarf sawfish there are indications that both sexes remain in the same overall region throughout their lives with little mixing between the subpopulations. In the largetooth sawfish the males appear to move more freely between the subpopulations, while mothers return to the region where they were born to give birth to their own young.[70][71]

The length of the full lifespan of sawfish is labeled with considerable uncertainty. A green sawfish caught as a juvenile lived for 35 years in captivity,[55] and a smalltooth sawfish lived for more than 42 years in captivity.[72] In the narrow sawfish it has been estimated that the lifespan is about 9 years, and in the Pristis sawfish it has been estimated that it varies from about 30 to more than 50 years depending on the exact species.[3]

Sawfish are predators that feed on fish, crustaceans and molluscs.[2] Old stories of sawfish attacking large prey such as whales and dolphins by cutting out pieces of flesh are now considered to be myths and not factual.[1][60] Humans are also far too large to be considered potential prey.[73]

In captivity they are typically fed ad libitum or in set amounts that (per week) equal 1–4% of the total weight of the sawfish, but there are indications that captives grow considerably faster than their wild counterparts.[55]

The rostrum (saw) plays a significant role in both locating the prey and capturing it, which is unique among jawed fish.[74][75] The head and rostrum contain thousands of sensory organs, the ampullae of Lorenzini, that allow the sawfish to detect and monitor the movements of other organisms by measuring the electric fields they emit.[76] Electroreception is also known from some other families of fish. In sawfish the sensory organs are packed most densely on the upper- and underside of the rostrum, although with minor differences in their position and numbers depending on exact species.[76] Those on the upperside allow sawfish to create an image of the three-dimensional area above it, even in waters of low visibility.[74] Utilizing their saw as an extended sensing device, sawfish are able to ""view"" their entire surroundings by maintaining a position low to the seafloor.[1] It appears that sawfish can detect potential prey items through electroreception from a distance of about 40 cm (16 in).[5] Some waters where sawfish live are very murky, limiting the possibility of hunting by sight.[71]

Exactly how they use their saw after the prey has been located has been debated, and some scholarship on the subject has been based on speculations rather than real observations.[5][75] In 2012 it was shown that there are three primary techniques, informally called ""saw in water"", ""saw on substrate"" and ""pin"".[75] If a prey item such as a fish is located in the open water, the sawfish uses the first method, making a rapid swipe at the prey with its saw to incapacitate it. It is then brought to the seabed and eaten.[5][55][75] The ""saw on substrate"" is similar, but used on prey at the seabed.[5][75] The saw is highly streamlined and when swiped it causes very little water movement.[77] The final method involves pinning the prey against the seabed with the underside of the saw, in a manner similar to that seen in guitarfish.[5][75] The ""pin"" is also used to manipulate the position of the prey, allowing fish to be swallowed head-first and thus without engaging any possible fin spines.[5][75] The spines of catfish, a common prey, have been found imbedded in the rostrum of sawfish.[33] Schools of mullets have been observed trying to escape sawfish.[78] Prey fish are typically swallowed whole and not cut into small pieces with the saw,[33] although on occasion one may be split in half during capture by the slashing motion.[5] Prey choice is therefore limited by the size of the mouth.[27] A 1.3 m (4.3 ft) sawfish had a 33 cm (13 in) catfish in its stomach.[71]

In the past it has been suggested that sawfish use their saw to dig/rake in the bottom for prey,[79] but this was not observed during the study in 2012,[75] or supported by later hydrodynamic studies.[77] Large sawfish often have rostral teeth with tips that are notably worn.[35]

Old stories often describe sawfish as highly dangerous to humans, sinking ships and cutting people in half, but today these are considered myths and not factual.[1][60] Sawfish are actually docile and harmless to humans, except when captured where they can inflict serious injuries when defending themselves by thrashing the saw from side-to-side.[6][16][55] The saw is also used in self-defense against predators such as sharks that potentially may eat sawfish.[33] In captivity they have been seen using their saws during fights over hierarchy or food.[71]

The largetooth sawfish (originally Squalus pristis, now Pristis pristis) was among the species described by Carl Linnaeus in Systema Naturae in 1758,[21] the starting point of modern zoological nomenclature, but sawfish were already known thousands of years earlier.[7]

Sawfish were occasionally mentioned in antiquity as much as 1800–2400 years ago,[4] in works such as Pliny's Natural History (77–79 AD).[citation needed] Pristis, the scientific name formalised for sawfish by Linnaeus in 1758, was also in use as a name even before his publication. For example, sawfish or ""priste"" were included in Libri de piscibus marinis in quibus verae piscium effigies expressae sunt by Guillaume Rondelet in 1554, and ""pristi"" were included in De piscibus libri V, et De cetis lib. vnus by Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1613.[citation needed] Outside Europe, sawfish are mentioned in old Persian texts, such as 13th century writings by Zakariya al-Qazwini.[4]

Sawfish have been found among archaeological remains in several parts of the world, including the Persian Gulf region, the Pacific coast of Panama, coastal Brazil and elsewhere.[4][80]

The cultural significance of sawfish varies significantly. The Aztecs in what is currently Mexico often included depictions of sawfish rostra (saws), notably as the striker/sword of the monster Cipactli.[81] Numerous sawfish rostra have been found buried at the Templo Mayor and two locations in coastal Veracruz had Aztec names referring to sawfish.[4] In the same general region, sawfish teeth have been found in Mayan graves.[82] The saw of sawfish is part of the dancing masks of the Huave and Zapotecs in Oaxaca, Mexico.[4][83] The Kuna people on the Caribbean coast of Panama and Colombia considers sawfish as rescuers of drowning people and protectors against dangerous sea creatures.[8] Also in Panama sawfish were recognized as containing powerful spirits that could protect humans against supernatural enemies.[8]

In the Bissagos Islands off West Africa dancing dressed as sawfish and other sea creatures is part of men's coming-of-age ceremonies.[81][84] In Gambia the saws indicate courage; the more on display at a house the more courageous the owner.[84] In Senegal the Lebu people believe the saw can protect their family, house and livestock. In the same general region they are recognized as ancestral spirits with the saw as a magic weapon. The Akan people of Ghana see sawfish as an authority symbol. There are proverbs with sawfish in the African language Duala.[85] In some other parts of coastal Africa, sawfish are considered extremely dangerous and supernatural, but their powers can be used by humans as their saw retains the powers against disease, bad luck and evil.[85] Among most African groups consumption of meat from sawfish is entirely acceptable, but in a few (in West Africa the Fula, Serer and Wolof people) it is taboo.[84] In the Niger Delta region of southern Nigeria, the saws of sawfish (known as oki in Ijaw and neighbouring languages) are often used in masquerades.[86]

In Asia, sawfish are a powerful symbol in many cultures. Asian shamans use sawfish rostrums for exorcisms and in other ceremonies to repel demons and disease.[87] They are believed to protect houses from ghosts when hung over doorways.[4] Illustrations of sawfish are often found at Buddhist temples in Thailand.[82] In the Sepik region of New Guinea locals admire sawfish, but also see them as punishers that will unleash heavy rainstorms on anyone breaking fishing taboos.[8] Among the Warnindhilyagwa, a group of Indigenous Australians, the ancestral sawfish Yukwurrirrindangwa and rays created the land. The ancestral sawfish carved out the river of Groote Eylandt with their saw.[8][88] Among European sailors sawfish were often feared as animals that could sink ships by piercing/sawing in the hull with their saw (claims now known to be entirely untrue),[60] but there are also stories of them saving people. In one case it was described how a ship almost sank during a storm in Italy in 1573. The sailors prayed and made it safely ashore where they discovered a sawfish that had ""plugged"" a hole in the ship with its saw. A sawfish rostrum said to be from this miraculous event is kept at the Sanctuary of Carmine Maggiore in Naples.[4]

Sawfish have been used as symbols in recent history. During World War II, illustrations of sawfish were placed on navy ships, and used as symbols by both American and Nazi German submarines.[8] Sawfish served as the emblem of the German U-96 submarine, known for its portrayal in Das Boot, and was later the symbol of the 9th U-boat Flotilla. The German World War II Kampfabzeichen der Kleinkampfverbände (Battle Badge of Small Combat Units) depicted a sawfish.

In cartoons and humorous popular culture, the sawfish—particularly its rostrum (""nose"")—has been employed as a sort of living tool. Examples of this can be found in Vicke Viking and Fighting Fantasy volume ""Demons of the Deep"".[citation needed]

A stylized sawfish was chosen by the Central Bank of the West African States to appear on coins and banknotes of the CFA currency. This was due to the mythological value representing fecundity and prosperity. The image takes its form from an Akan and Baoule bronze weight used for exchanges in the commercial trade of gold powder.[84]

Sawfish are popular in public aquariums, but require very large tanks. In a review of 10 North American and European public aquariums that kept sawfish, their tanks were all very large and ranged from about 1,500,000 to 24,200,000 l (400,000–6,390,000 US gal).[55] Individuals in public aquariums often function as ""ambassadors"" for sawfish and their conservation plight.[90][91] In captivity they are quite robust, appear to grow faster than their wild counterparts (perhaps due to consistent access to food) and individuals have lived for decades, but breeding them has proven difficult.[55] In 2012, four smalltooth sawfish pups were born at Atlantis Paradise Island in the Bahamas and this remains the only time a member of this family has been successfully bred in captivity[55][89] (unsuccessful breeding attempts had happened earlier at the same facility, including a miscarriage in 2003).[92] Nevertheless, it is hoped that this success may be the first step in a captive breeding program for the threatened sawfish.[4] It is speculated that seasonal variations in water temperature, salinity and photoperiod are necessary to encourage breeding.[55] Artificial insemination, as already has been done in a few captive sharks, is also being considered.[93] Tracking studies indicate that if sawfish are released to the wild after spending a period in captivity (for example, if they outgrow their exhibit), they rapidly adopt a movement pattern similar to that of fully wild sawfish.[94]

Among the five sawfish species, only the four Pristis species are known to be kept in public aquariums. The most common is the largetooth sawfish with studbooks including 16 individuals in North America in 2014, 5 individuals in Europe in 2013 and 13 individuals in Australia in 2017, followed by the green sawfish with 13 individuals in North America and 6 in Europe.[55] Both these species are also kept at public aquariums in Asia and the only captive dwarf sawfish are in Japan.[95] In 2014, studbooks included 12 smalltooth sawfish in North America,[55] and the only kept elsewhere are at a public aquarium in Colombia.[95]

Sawfish were once common, locally even abundant,[4][7] but they have declined drastically and are now possibly the most threatened group of marine fish.[3]

Fishing for various uses

Sawfish and their parts have been used for numerous things. In approximate order of impact, the four most serious threats today are use in shark fin soup, as traditional medicine, rostral teeth for cockfighting spurs and the saw as a novelty item.[4] Despite being rays rather than sharks,[2] sawfish have some of most prized fins for use in shark fin soup, on level with tiger, mako, blue, porbeagle, thresher, hammerhead, blacktip, sandbar and bull shark.[96] As traditional medicine (especially Chinese medicine, but also known from Mexico, Brazil, Kenya, Eritrea, Yemen, Iran, India and Bangladesh) sawfish parts, oil or powder have been claimed to work against respiratory ailments, eye problems, rheumatism, pain, inflammation, scabies, skin ulcers, diarrhea and stomach problems, but there is no evidence supporting any of these uses.[4] The saws are used in ceremonies and as curiosities. Until relatively recently many saws were sold to visiting tourists, or through antique stores or shell shops, but they are now mostly sold online, often illegally.[4] In 2007 it was estimated that the fins and saw from a single sawfish potentially could earn a fisher more than US$5,000 in Kenya and in 2014 a single rostral tooth sold as cockfighting spurs in Peru or Ecuador had a value of up to US$220.[4] Secondary uses are the meat for consumption and the skin for leather.[4] Historically the saws were used as weapons (large saws) and combs (small saws).[88] Oil from the liver was prized for use in boat repairs and street lights,[97] and as recent as the 1920s in Florida it was regarded as the best fish oil for consumption.[4]

Sawfish fishing goes back several thousand years,[7] but until relatively recently it typically involved traditional low-intensity methods such as simple hook-and-line or spearing. In most regions the major population decline in sawfish started in the 1960s–1980s.[7][84][97] This coincided with a major growth in demand of fins for shark fin soup, the expansion of the international shark finning fishing fleet,[84] and a proliferation of modern nylon fishing nets.[97] The exception is the dwarf sawfish which was relatively widespread in the Indo-Pacific, but by the early 1900s it had already disappeared from most of its range, only surviving for certain in Australia (there is a single recent possible record from the Arabian region).[3][98] The saw has been described as sawfish's Achilles' heel, as it easily becomes entangled in fishing nets.[99] Sawfish can also be difficult or dangerous to release from nets, meaning that some fishers will kill them even before bringing them aboard the boat,[56] or cut off the saw to keep it/release the fish. Because it is their main hunting device, the long-term survival of saw-less sawfish is highly questionable.[100] In Australia where sawfish have to be released if caught, the narrow sawfish has the highest mortality rate,[68] but it is still almost 50% for dwarf sawfish caught in gill nets.[98] In an attempt of lowering this, a guide to sawfish release has been published.[101]

Although fishing is the main cause of the drastic decline in sawfish, another serious problem is habitat destruction. Coastal and estuarine habitats, including mangrove and seagrass meadows, are often degraded by human developments and pollution, and these are important habitats for sawfish, especially their young.[4][102] In a study of juvenile sawfish in Western Australia's Fitzroy River about 60% had bite marks from bull sharks or crocodiles.[103] Changes to river flows, such as by dams or droughts, can increase the risk faced by sawfish young by bringing them into more contact with predators.[69][104][105]

The combined range of the five sawfish species encompassed 90 countries, but today they have certainly disappeared entirely from 20 of these and possibly disappeared from several others.[3] Many more have lost at least one of their species, leaving only one or two remaining.[3]

The only remaining stronghold of the four species in the Indo-Pacific region (narrow, dwarf, largetooth and green sawfish) is in Northern Australia, but they have also experienced a declined there.[4][71] Pristis sawfish are protected in Australia and only Indigenous Australians can legally catch them.[102][106] Violations can result in a fine of up to AU$121,900.[13] The narrow sawfish does not receive the same level of protection as the Pristis sawfish.[102][107] Under CITES regulations, Australia was the only country that could export wild-caught sawfish for the aquarium trade from 2007 to 2013 (no country afterwards).[21] This strictly involved the largetooth sawfish where the Australian population remains relatively robust, and only living individuals ""to appropriate and acceptable aquaria for primarily conservation purposes"".[21] Numbers traded were very low (eight between 2007 and 2011),[4] and following a review Australia did not export any after 2011.[21]

Largetooth sawfish have been monitored in Fitzroy River, Western Australia, a primary stronghold for the species, since 2000. In December 2018, the largest recorded mass fish death in the river occurred when more than 40 sawfish died, mainly because of heat and a severe lack of rainfall during a poor wet season.[105] A 14-day research expedition in Far North Queensland in October 2019 did not spot a single sawfish. Expert Dr Peter Kyne of Charles Darwin University said that habitat change in the south and gillnet fishing in the north had contributed to the decline in numbers, but now that fishers had started working with the conservationists, dams and water diversions to the river flows had become a bigger problem in the north. Also, impact of successful saltwater crocodile conservation is a negative one on sawfish populations. However, there were still good populations in the Adelaide River and Daly River in the Northern Territory, and the Fitzroy River in the Kimberley.[108]

A study by Murdoch University researchers and Indigenous rangers, which captured more than 500 sawfish between 2002 and 2018, concluded that the survival of the sawfish could be at risk from dams or major water diversions on the Fitzroy River. It found that the fish are completely reliant on the Kimberley's wet season floods to complete their breeding cycle; in recent drier years, the population has suffered. There has been debate about using water from the river for agriculture and to grow fodder crops for cattle in the region.[109]

Sharks and Rays Australia (SARA) are conducting a citizen science investigation to understand the sawfish's historical habitats. Citizen can report their sawfish sighting online.[110]

Except for Australia, sawfish have been extirpated or only survive in very low numbers in the Indo-Pacific region. For example, among the four species only two (narrow and largetooth sawfish) certainly survive in South Asia, and only two (narrow and green sawfish) certainly survive in Southeast Asia.[3]

The status of the two species of the Atlantic region, the smalltooth and largetooth sawfish, is comparable to the Indo-Pacific. For example, sawfish have been entirely extirpated from most of the Atlantic coast of Africa (only survives for certain in Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone), as well as South Africa.[3][111] The only relatively large remaining population of the largetooth sawfish in the Atlantic region is at the Amazon estuary in Brazil, but there are smaller in Central America and West Africa, and this species is also found in the Pacific and Indian Oceans.[112] The smalltooth sawfish is only found in the Atlantic region and it is possibly the most threatened of all the species, as it had the smallest original range (range 2,100,000 km2 or 810,000 sq mi) and has experienced the greatest contraction (disappeared from c. 81% of its original range).[4] It only survives for certain in six countries,[113] and it is possible that the only remaining viable population is in the United States.[99] In the United States the smalltooth sawfish once occurred from Texas to New York, but its numbers have declined by at least 95% and today it is essentially restricted to Florida.[114][115] However, the Florida population retains a high genetic diversity,[114] has now stabilised and appears to be slowly increasing.[82][115] A Recovery Plan for the smalltooth sawfish has been in effect since 2002.[102] It has been strictly protected in the United States since 2003 when it was added to the Endangered Species Act as the first marine fish.[116] This makes it ""illegal to harm, harass, hook, or net sawfish in any way, except with a permit or in a permitted fishery"".[14] The fine is up to US$10,000 for the first violation alone.[14] If accidentally caught, the sawfish has to be released as carefully as possible and a basic how-to guide has been published.[14] In 2003 an attempt of adding the largetooth sawfish to the Endangered Species Act was denied, in part because this species does not occur in the United States anymore[116] (last confirmed US record in 1961).[112] However, it was added in 2011,[117] and all the remaining sawfish species were added in 2014, restricting trade in them and their parts in the United States.[36] In 2020, a Florida fisherman used a power saw to remove a smalltooth sawfish’s rostrum and then released the maimed fish; he received a fine, community service and probation. [118]

Since 2007, all sawfish species have been listed on CITES Appendix I, which prohibits international trade in them and their parts.[11][12][119] The only exception was the relatively robust Australian population of the largetooth sawfish that was listed on CITES Appendix II, which allowed trade to public aquariums only.[11] Following reviews Australia did not use this option after 2011 and in 2013 it too was moved to Appendix I.[21] In addition to Australia and the United States, sawfish are protected in the European Union, Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Guinea, Senegal and South Africa, but they are likely already functionally extirpated or entirely extirpated from several of these countries.[3][7][120][121] Illegal fishing continues and in many countries enforcement of fishing laws is lacking.[3][21] Even in Australia where relatively well-protected, people are occasionally caught illegally trying to sell sawfish parts, especially the saw.[13] The saw is distinctive, but it can be difficult to identify flesh or fins as originating from sawfish when cut up for sale at fish markets. This can be resolved with DNA testing.[122] If protected their relatively low reproduction rates make these animals especially slow to recover from overfishing.[87] An example of this is the largetooth sawfish in Lake Nicaragua where once abundant. The population rapidly crashed during the 1970s when tens of thousands were caught. It was protected by the Nicaraguan government in the early 1980s, but remains rare today.[4] Nevertheless, there are indications that at least the smalltooth sawfish population may be able to recover at a faster pace than formerly believed, if well-protected.[123] Uniquely in this family, the narrow sawfish has a relatively fast reproduction rate (generation length about 4.6 years, less than one-third the time of the other species), it has experienced the smallest contraction of its range (30%) and it is one of only two species considered Endangered rather than Critically Endangered by the IUCN.[3] The other rated as Endangered is the dwarf sawfish, but this primarily reflects that its main decline happened at least 100 years ago and IUCN ratings are based on the time period of the last three generations (estimated about 49 years in dwarf sawfish).[3][98]

There are several research projects aimed at sawfish in Australia and North America, but also a few in other continents.[124] The Florida Museum of Natural History maintains the International Sawfish Encounter Database where people worldwide are encouraged to report any sawfish encounters, whether it was living or a rostrum seen for sale in a shop/online.[4][14][82] Its data is used by biologists and conservationists for evaluating the habitat, range and abundance of sawfish around the world.[4] In an attempt of increasing the knowledge of their plight the first ""Sawfish Day"" was held on 17 October 2017,[83][125] and this was repeated on the same date in 2018.[126]

1195,"The existence of the legendary Bigfoot is one of the world’s greatest unsolved mysteries, but even after his reported death, he remains an enigma.

Amid rumours a turkey hunter had shot and killed the 10ft beast, a resident in rural Pennsylvania called 911 and claimed he had evidence the sasquatch was real after finding a huge footprint near his home.

Now hundreds of conspiracy theorists have accused ­authorities of a cover-up after reports of military ­helicopters swooping on the area - possibly to remove the Bigfoot’s body – and the fact local police dismissed the footprint as a bear’s.

Thomas Rogers, who has followed reports of Bigfoot for 24 years, said: “This stinks to high heaven.

""They clearly know something but they are keeping us in the dark. With all sightings we have to take them seriously and this is no different.

“Sadly for us though, until a body is found, the question of whether Bigfoot exists or not is still a mystery.”

The rumour mill started on May 14, when police took an emergency call from John Winesickle – the resident who found the footprint, in Paint Township, Somerset County.

A 911 operator tipped off local officers who agreed to investigate.

Within hours, Pennsylvania Bigfoot Society received an email from an enthusiast who said he had overheard chatter on a police scanner after an unidentified hunter claimed to have shot a Bigfoot.

The message read: “Officers confirmed there was an unidentified animal shot and killed. Details are a bit fuzzy at this time.”

Just 40 minutes later, the society received an even more bizarre email.

It read: “Hello, YES, this is legit, a strange report came over the scanner here in Somerset, PA, just a few miles from Flight 93 memorial.”

The message also told of how a follower monitoring a scanner heard police joking about the shooting claim.

It said: “It was about 20 minutes later that he said he heard a police officer radio back and state, ‘There was a body’.

“He said the next radio transmission to the officer was, ‘Call the centre’.”

The email also mentions a “large helicopter” in the area.

It added: “The sound was so loud it shook his house, so he went outside to take a look.

“It was then that he observed a formation of four Army Apache helicopters moving in the direction of Somerset.”

The official police log tells how officer Christopher Swartz inspected the footprints found by John Winesickle.

He concluded they belonged to a bear.

Officer Swartz wrote” “I advised John this. He was not happy with the answer.

“He said he could definitely tell the ­difference between a bear footprint and a Bigfoot footprint. I decided not to argue.”

Last night John hit back. He fumed: “No, no, no. A bear can’t go down a steep bank on all twos. That’s proven this is a Bigfoot.”

Previous witnesses have described the beast as having large eyes, a pronounced brow, low-set forehead and a crested gorilla-type crown.

He is commonly reported to have a bad smell and feet up to two foot long.",mainstream
228,"MADRID -- Just hours ahead of Britain's EU referendum, a group of fintech CEOs attending MoneyConf in the Spanish capital have made very clear Brexit is not a good idea for their sector.

“If Brexit happens, the U.K. suffers, Europe suffers,"" said Taavet Hinrikus, CEO and co-founder of TransferWise, a currency exchange platform. ""Today, London is the global fintech capital -- that's at risk.”

Some fintech executives said an Out vote on Thursday means firms might have to leave London.

""In the worst post-Brexit scenario, U.K. fintechs would need headquarters in another EU country,"" said the CEO of Barcelona-based Kantox, Philippe Gelis. ""In the best scenario, we will keep to 'business as usual.' ""

Daniel Döderlein, the founder and CEO of AUKA, a Norwegian cloud-based mobile payment firm, believes a Brexit would be like shooting oneself in the foot for the British fintech industry. “The current regulatory and economic ecosystem in the U.K. has created an ideal ecosystem for fintechs to thrive,"" he said.

But once outside the EU, added Döderlein, ""the U.K. isn’t as big or as global as it is now."" This means U.K. fintech firms that want to grow their business across the EU would have to ""go through regulatory challenges, opening up subsidiaries, restructuring legal entities, filing for a new license, and so forth -- it would be a huge problem.”

According to CurrencyCloud founder and chief Mike Laven, over time fintech firms can cope with such challenges, but the increased volatility, uncertainty, and complexity in the market “can never be good for our business.”

Meanwhile, Mark Dowds, the co-founder of online insurance platform Trov, which is due to launch in Britain by the end of the year, warned against a possible domino effect of Brexit on the U.K.'s own unity. “I’m based in Belfast, and who knows what Brexit might mean for Northern Ireland or Scotland, for example?” he asked.

The downbeat note was echoed even more starkly by Brett Meyers, CEO of CurrencyFair: “It's the kind of thing we might look back on in 10 years when Europe or the world is at war, and we wonder where it all went wrong ... in one of those signs of the world pulling apart rather than coming together that triggers other more negative events.”",mainstream
1179,"12 Examples That Show That America Is Far More Messed Up Than When You Were A Kid

What in the world has happened to our country? Most of us have very fond memories from when we were younger, and it is true that often our memories of “the good old days” can leave out the bad parts. None of us are perfect individually, and America has certainly never been without major problems as a nation. But have we ever witnessed the level of social decay that we are seeing around the country today? We are like a divorced, bloated, drug-addicted middle age man that has seen his life completely fall apart, and it would be nice to believe that we have hit rock bottom, but the truth is that we just keep on sinking even lower. The following are 12 examples that show that America is far more messed up than when you were a kid…

#1 When I was young, fast food was something that people would get as a treat every once in a while. Today, more than a third of the country has made it a lifestyle…

No wonder obesity rates are at an all-time high and so many of us are developing cancer, heart disease and diabetes…

#2 Overdosing on drugs is now the leading cause of death for Americans under 50, and we now grappling with the worst opioid crisis in our entire history…

Drug overdoses are the leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 50, who are now more likely to die from a drug overdose than from car accidents or firearms. The United States has the dubious distinction of having the highest percentage of drug-related deaths in the world. However, while opioid abuse is a nationwide problem, Visual Capitalist’s Nick Routley notes that there are specific areas that are being hit harder by this epidemic. Using the location data above, from NORC at the University of Chicago, we can see clusters of counties that have an extremely high rate of overdose deaths. Between 2012 and 2016, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio saw a combined 18,000 deaths related to opioid abuse.

#3 We often remember the 1970s and the 1980s as the time when cocaine use was out of control in America, but the truth is that cocaine deaths in the U.S. just hit a brand new all-time record high…

#4 And of course meth use continues to spiral wildly out of control. Just recently, a mother was arrested for leaving her two young children alone in a hot car with a bag of meth sitting on the front seat. How out of it do you have to be to do something like this?…

#5 Speaking of discount retailers, something very unusual recently happened at a Wal-Mart store. After spotting an 8-year-old girl that he liked, an 81-year-old man offered to “buy her” from her mother for $200,000…

#6 In this day and age, we are inventing new ways to abuse our children. Just recently, it came out that a daycare center in Missouri had hosted a “fight club” during which the toddlers were urged to beat the living daylights out of one another…

#7 And of course more allegations of sexual abuse seem to come out on a constant basis these days. In Massachusetts, a youth football coach has been charged with raping numerous young boys and recording the attacks on video. In the old days this would have been a major scandal, but these days this kind of thing happens so frequently that major U.S. news outlets barely reported on it. The following comes from a British news source…

#8 Another thing that happens so frequently that it barely makes a blip on the news are mass brawls. Just recently, a mass brawl involving “up to 200 school students” happened in Philadelphia, but once again it was almost entirely ignored by the media…

#9 But even though there is so much pure evil going on all around us, if you really want to make a big media splash just do or say something that is really “politically incorrect”. In our current environment, just about everything offends “the thought police”. For example, Kleenex was recently forced to give their “Mansize” tissues a new name because the old name was considered to be “sexist” by some people…

#10 When I was young, I don’t remember hearing about any mass shootings. Eventually they started to become more common, and now they are happening so rapidly that it is difficult to keep up with them all. For example, a mass shooting at a Halloween event in southern California that happened about a week ago barely got noticed by the mainstream media…

If something like this had happened 40 years ago, it would have been a top news story for weeks.

#11 If you were in an accident and you had to have your foot amputated, what would you do with that foot? Well, one guy decided that he would grind it up and use it in tacos that he would feed to his friends…

Apparently this is not illegal, but it should be. If someone fed me their severed foot without my knowledge I would be absolutely furious.

#12 Of course any list like this would be incomplete without an example of gross government incompetence…

To me, the most incredible part of this story is that the guy was able to stay employed long enough to visit “9,000 adult video sites”. Didn’t this guy have a superviser, and why did it take so long to discover that he was endlessly watching adult videos while at work?

As you can see, America is a giant mess and we desperately need to get things turned around. When people say that they want to “make America great again”, what they are really admitting is that America has fallen from greatness and needs to be restored.

Bangladesh police today handed over to the FBI for testing blood and hair samples of militants who carried out the country's worst terror attack in which 22 people, mostly foreigners, were killed.

DNA testing is taking a bite out of the Bigfoot legend. After scientists analysed more than 30 hair samples reportedly left behind by Bigfoot and similar mythical beasts like the Himalayan Yeti, they found all of them came from more mundane creatures like bears, wolves, cows and raccoons.

12,"The New Slavery: Pigs are Tigers and Farmers are Felons

In “A Critical Mass for Real Food,” Anim Steel began with “The old logic of the slave plantation is still the logic of our industrial food system, 500 years in the making.”

The idea that a slave mentality is still woven into production of food showed up as well in an article referencing the KKK. It describes the similarity between grossly discriminatory laws that were used to remove black voting rights (poll taxes and literacy tests) and the current discriminatory laws that are crushing small food producers (exorbitant certification costs, and irrelevant yet intentionally impossible to achieve food safety standards), and calling the food movement the most significant civil rights (and human rights) movement in history.

Using this template of slavery allows the public to recognize the extreme and corrupt measures being taken to remove livestock producers markets, leaving them no means to sell their products other than through the big corporate meat packers, and then at a pittance, reducing independent (free) producers to contract farmers, or tenant farmers, on their own land.

The current system is without question working to break the back of free farming and ranching. But full blown slavery* already exists for industrial food animals. Recognizing that reality can help explain a great deal else.



They are trapped in concrete and metal prisons known as CAFOs (Confined Animal Feeding Operations), where they are denied both normal movement and their natural diet and are fed GMOs that are linked to organ failure, diseases, and sterility.

The point here, is not to focus on those abuses which many groups are addressing now. The point is to see as fully as possible the ways in which the industrial food system is still functioning as it did during slavery, so people will recognize it and it can stop.

During slavery, harboring a slave was a felony. Today, the slaves are animals.

A digression: Today the industrial food system is connected to the biotech industry which is involved in genetically engineering animals and patenting them. That is a new and extreme form of ownership of animals. For even if a farmer were to buy such an animal, they would never actually own it or its offspring, just as those buying genetically engineered seeds do not own the seeds, and are not allowed to produce their own seeds from the crops. Patented genetically engineered animals or seeds are meant to be an infinite form of ownership. It creates a plantation system wherever the seeds or animals would be sold, because the farmer would simply be working for the owners of the patents.

Knowing two facts – that harboring slaves was a felony and that today’s animals are the slaves – allows the public to look with fresh eyes at what is happening to animals here and around the world.

In Michigan, small farmers’ hogs have been declared “wild” or feral, and any and all farmers “harboring” them are now deemed by law to be committing a felony. The hogs in question are not feral but are being raised as part of the farmers’ small livelihood. Their crime is that those hogs have “escaped” living in CAFOs. They are “off the plantation.” They do not eat industrial feed and are cheap to raise. The farmers raising them are growing in numbers because an increasing number of people are seeking just such clean and locally raised meat.

The big pork producers in Michigan got laws put on the books to declare the small farmers’ pigs a danger, acting just as the big slave owners did, who had the political power to declare any black person outside of slavery a danger and anyone protecting them a criminal. Today the slaves are animals and they need only be declared a threat, however fictional, to have them destroyed. With them all destroyed, there would remain, of course, only the slave animals owned by the agribusiness. The free hogs are the biologic diversity that the biotech industry wants eliminated just as it has to eliminate the great diversity in seed stocks, as it came forward with its own GE-seeds.

It doesn’t matter what fear is used to accomplished this. If one listens carefully, one can hear, applied to animals, a repetition of old slavery methods used to demonize blacks in order to control or kill them – savage, wild, a threat to the genetic stock of white people, filthy, etc.

The Department of Natural Resources in Michigan declared small farmers’ pigs an invasive species.

The law is to stop pigs being outside or on pasture, a form of freedom. These pigs are living behind fences and are livestock – they are not feral. But in being outside or on pasture, they are owned by small farmers and thus are “free” of the slave system of industrial agriculture.

The means to slaughter these animals are many, beyond calling them invasive and equating them to tigers.

Invented diseases have become a major one, because, across all justifications for slaughter, fear is the common denominator.

If an agency says animals are suspected of having a disease (they do not have to be proven as such) and wants them destroyed, those “harboring” the animals to save them – and their biologic diversity – are declared felons. In a recent case in Canada, a rare breed of Shropshire sheep was slaughtered and farmers accused of felonies, provides a good example. As with plantation owners’ efforts to catch escaped slaves, fear of those who have escaped is used to influence public.

And just such a false attack and slaughtering of healthy sheep has happened before. From the Organic Consumers Association: MAD SHEEP

One of the farmers charged is Michael Schmidt, a national leader in standing up for the rights of farmers to produce and sell fresh milk directly to customers. While the media focus has been kept on the milk, the underlying issue for industrial agriculture is that Mr. Schmidt has bypassed the slavery inherent in that system for his animals and himself. He is a free man, milking his cows and trading with those who want the milk.

In the following comment, one can recognize in Mr. Schmidt’s words, the language of thwhat is happeninge abolition movement that provided safe haven for slaves, and Mr. Schmidt’s awareness of the genetic engineering issue behind

This risking of personal safety to save other living creatures is a direct replay of what people did during abolition, only it is for the lives of animals now. And they offer biodiversity which humanity and nature itself requires to live. Like the abolitionists, the farmers are demanding trials (tests of whether the animals are actually sick).

The pork industry law in Michigan is stamping out biodiversity. Schmidt says:

In Korea, over three million animals were slaughtered based on an alleged outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease, a disease harmless to humans and something most animals get over in a week. 70,000 military was brought out and hogs were buried alive.

What the governments do not want the public to hear is the reality which is entirely non-threatening.

Diseases become associated with animals though we have lived with them for millions of years, and some of the healthiest people in the country are the Amish who are in daily contact with them.

Genetic engineering means the animals will not even be free to exist as themselves, with their own biology. Their biology – not just their every movements and everything they eat – will be taken over and controlled. This is perhaps the most intense form of slavery.



Laws in the US arranging such mass slaughter are now on the books. If an “outbreak” is declared (two in the UK were from germ lab leaks), based on international laws put in place by the multinational agribusiness, no proof is needed that an animal is sick, for it and millions of others to be exterminated. And the CDC, which would declare an outbreak is already working on scare tactics , warning people away from county fairs, the heart of life for small farming communities. Pictures of happy kids and animals is supposed to strike fear into people, just as pictures of black people around white children was supposed to during slavery. One is reminded of the CDC’s false information on the swine flu in 2009, where 98-99% of the cases they claimed were swine flu in California, were not (most were not even flu of any kind), and attempted to block a CBS investigation.

Even as the CDC is warning about danger kids enjoying being around pigs, the CDC itself is not responding to a direct court order to turn over documents involving a danger to all children in the US (in the UK, documents have been turned over) and the US government is proposing some documents be declared non-existent.

Animal disease scares such as FMD and swine flu (for example, in Haiti and Egypt) have been used to get rid of small farmers animals, a means of moving toward only slave animals (GE-animals in CAFOs). Avian flu doesn’t exist, but it has been used to wipe out the biologic diversity in poultry across Asia. Small farmers with free range chickens of many kinds, lost their animals and laws were put in place favoring the slavery conditions of the big multinational poultry plantations. The chickens living in cities now, beloved by families, and “free” of the horrific slave conditions of the giant poultry houses, are sitting ducks for the declaration of avian flu and orders to exterminate perfectly healthy animals to the benefit of industrial ag. Families harboring chickens would be declared felons for threatening the public health, for a non-existent disease. Children hiding their healthy chicks would be criminals.

Once one appreciates that the industrial food system has been based from the beginning in slavery, and that animals are the new slaves. A great deal become clear. Free animals must be gotten rid of and those trying to save them and our common heritage in biodiversity must be branded as felons. Those protecting the pigs, sheep, and other animals, and their crucial biologic diversity for everyone, are functioning just as people did during slavery, risking their own freedom to protect blacks seeking their own.

Our farmers are part of a new anti-slavery movement. Saving the animals, means saving our freedom of food, sustainable agriculture, and ultimately ourselves.

*There are also people caught in literal slave environments in other countries forced to do agricultural work.

138,"Claudia Ackley is positive that she and her two daughters came across Bigfoot in a tree in southern California last year, but when she called different state authorities to report the sighting, she got the same response.

Nope, they told her, you saw a bear. As a result, the 46-year-old has filed a lawsuit against the state for failing to recognize Sasquatch as a distinct species, reports the Press-Enterprise.

In this case, you can judge for yourself: An ABC 30 report on Ackley's sighting includes phone video shot by her daughter near Lake Arrowhead in the San Bernardino mountains.

(It was shot around dusk and is pretty dark.) Ackley filed her suit with documentary filmmaker Todd Standing, who made the Netflix film ""Discovering Bigfoot"" and who believes the sighting is legit.

State officials won't comment on pending litigation. ""He looked like a Neanderthal man with hair all over him,"" said Ackley, who says this is the second sure sighting of Bigfoot she has made.

""He had solid black eyes. He had no expression on his face at all. He did not show his teeth. He just stared at the three of us."" The three then safely walked away, she says.

Among other things, the lawsuit says the state is endangering the public by not recognizing Bigfoot and calls on it to ""'manage this wildlife species"" and protect its habitat.

You can read the lawsuit in full at Gizmodo, which says it makes ""some valid and interesting points."" In the meantime, Ackley is leaving fruit and snacks out, along with a voice-activated book that includes recordings of words like ""fur"" and ""candy,"" and samples of each, in an attempt to communicate.

 [2012] Slave Species of the Gods: The Secret History of the Anunnaki and Their Mission on Earth by Michael Tellinger (Sep 14, 2012)

Michael Tellinger shows off what could be one of the best pieces of evidence that there were giants on Earth a long, long time ago. Geologists have marvelled at this giant foot print in rough granite, about 4 feet long. Some still say that it is a natural erosion pattern.

Personally I find that suggestion highy improbable for various reasons that I will not go into here. Prof. Pieter Wagener from UPE, suggests that ""there is a higher probability of little green men arriving from space and licking it out with their tongues, than being created by natural erosion"".

It is located in South Africa, near the town of Mpaluzi, close to the Swaziland border. It is estimated to be between 200 million and 3 Billion years old because of our current understanding of the formation of granites in Earth's history. This dating immediately causes great debate and argument - so I urge you to keep your mind open and focused on the evidence.

This amazing footprint in granite was discovered in 1912 by a hunter called Stoffel Coetzee, while hunting in the remote area. At the time this was a deeply remote part of South Africa known as the Eastern Transvaal, teeming with wild life, including antelope and lions. It remains in the same condition as it was when first discovered and the possibility that this was a carved hoax is extremely low because of its remote location. Even today, it is difficult to find.

The real mystery is how this amazing phenomenon occured - I have no idea - but here it is and we cannot wish it away.

YES - It is granite - it is a well recognised geological part of South Africa and recorded on all geological maps - that is why this footprint is such an incredible mystery. It can be desribed as a ""phenocrystic"" granite, OR coarse porphyritic granite, that underwent several different stages of cooling. The result being an interesting mixture of large and small granules. This is why granite companies are keen to mine this area for granite because it will look really ""pretty"" when polished. In the official Geology Of South Africa, this outcrop is called Mpuluzi Batholith (Granite) and the official dating of this rock produced dates of around 3,1 billion years.",conspiracy

866,"Bigfoot fanatics claim that a ""nest"" of trees found in the Kemerovo region is evidence that the creature was roaming the region and building homes in the same way that orang-utans or gorillas would.

Bigfoot experts from Russia, Canada, the US and Sweden recently met at a conference in Moscow before mounting an expedition to Siberia, where stories of the ""Wildman"" abound, the Sun reports.

John Bindernagel, a biologist who took part in the expedition, told the paper: ""We didn't feel like the trees we saw in Siberia had been done by a man or another mammal.

""Twisted trees like this have also been observed in North America and they could fit with the theory that Bigfoot makes nests.

""The nests we have looked at are built around trees twisted together into an arch shape.""

Bigfoot, also known as sasquatch, is an apelike cryptid that purportedly inhabits forests, mainly in the Pacific Northwest region of North America.

Sightings of similar creatures have been reported in Russia, France and the Himalayas, where it is known as the Yeti.

But scientists have in the past discounted the existence of Bigfoot and consider it to be a combination of folklore, misidentification, and hoax, rather than a living animal, in part because of the large numbers thought necessary to maintain a breeding population.",mainstream
26,"n an isolated Polish village, Big Foot has been found dead. No, not Big Foot. In Olga Tokarczuk’s newly translated novel, Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead , eccentric 60-something narrator Janina Duszejko prefers epithets to given names. It’s her neighbor Oddball who knocks on her door and takes her to their other neighbor Big Foot’s house, where they find his mangled body on the kitchen floor. After calling the police, Oddball tells Janina they must dress him–it would be “inhuman” to leave him in his dirty clothes–which is when they find a deer’s bone lodged in his mouth.

The relationship between animals and humans lies at the center of . The novel is short-listed for the Man Booker International Prize, which Tokarczuk last year became the first Polish writer to win, for her novel . , originally published in Polish in 2009, follows Janina, who is passionate about animal rights and at odds with the many hunters in her community–including, before his death, Big Foot. And his demise is just the beginning of this winding, imaginative, genre-defying story.

Part murder mystery, part fairy tale, is a thrilling philosophical examination of the ways in which some living creatures are privileged above others. Tokarczuk’s protagonist is delightfully specific: she studies astrology, translates William Blake’s poetry and makes bizarre proclamations (“I must always wash my feet thoroughly before bed”). As more bodies pile up, Janina inserts herself into the investigations. The people around her don’t find her quite as amusing; the police brush her off as a crazy old lady. But she believes there must be a tie between the dead bodies and the routine killing of animals, even if nobody wants to hear it. The novel turns from humorous and outlandish to controlled and commanding as Janina methodically ties the victims’ horoscopes to their brutal deaths.

Though Tokarczuk builds suspense with swift and urgent prose, what captivates most is Janina’s intensity, stemming from her experience of the world as an outsider and an advocate for the voiceless. She proves that her demands are ones worth heeding, challenging the ways in which people decide who–and what–is worth protecting.

714,"The all-male Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo and its antecedents began life in the early 1970s as a balletomanes' jeu d'esprit: witty, informed ballet sendups combined with a poignant fantasy of ballerina glamour. The emphasis then swung to pretty good technical dancing mixed with mostly funny mugging. But the program presented Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater by the Trocks, as they are now known, largely failed to achieve that difficult balance.

The dancers look happier dancing well than goofing up, and the difference was distracting in the opening excerpt from ""Swan Lake."" The humor was still witty, as when a nicely danced solo by Ashley Romanoff-Titwillow's (Joshua Grant) gangly Prince is unexpectedly preserved for history with the flash of a camera operated by his hapless Benno. But Olga Supphozova (Robert Carter), one of the company's most skillful and poignant ballerinas, no longer blends the pyrotechnics and gags as Odette. And her campy, troll-like Glove Seller was an embarrassment in a dimwitted new production of ""Gaîté Parisienne.""

It would probably take the sly sophistication of Peter Anastos, an early Trocks choreographer, to pull off a parody of ""Gaîté."" Susan Trevino's staging fails to suggest the subtle mix of giddiness, perfume and chic in the 1938 original by Léonide Massine and its fabled production by the Ballets Russe de Monte Carlo. And the costumes and set looked bargain-basement and saccharine in an otherwise exquisitely designed evening.

A staging by Robert La Fosse of Jerome Robbins's dark ""Cage"" on the second program may work better. But the highlights of the first program were the most purely classical performances -- in the ""Flames of Paris"" pas de deux, ""La Cachucha"" and the pas de six from ""Esmeralda"" -- where the comedy grew naturally from heartfelt dancing.

1263,"Antarctica is a very interesting place. It is a massive continent located over the Earth’s South Pole with no owner and no government. Twelve countries have made territorial claims there and 52 nations share international control over the frozen wasteland whose harsh climate appeals only to penguins and a few other hardy animals.

The Antarctic Treaty signed on December 1, 1959, and entered into force in 1961, mandated that Antarctica would be used solely for peaceful purposes, scientific research, and information sharing. At that time, seven countries (Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom) had already laid claims to territories there.

The international agreement also provided that “All areas of Antarctica, including all stations, installations and equipment within those areas…shall be open at all times to inspection.”

What’s more, all previous claims to Antarctic territory, which represents a whopping 10 percent of the total land mass on Earth, became null and void after the Antarctic Treaty was signed. This global experimental science lab continues year-round operations to this day.

Unless you follow conspiracy theories and topics of high strangeness – paranormal phenomena, notably Unidentified Flying Objects and extraterrestrials – you might not know that Antarctica has been flagged as a place of special interest by such researchers, many of whom are highly credible with advanced academic degrees.

I am such an investigator: rational, skeptical, and a computer scientist. Almost a year ago, I wrote about three super-strange Antarctic conspiracies and why some people “in the know” believe they may well be true:
• There are Big Pyramids Buried in Antarctic Ice
• Other Earth Species and/or Aliens Have a Portal to their Underworld in Antarctica

Antarctica pops in and out of the mainstream news. On September 15, 1999, former U.S. President Bill Clinton paid an official visit to the American Antarctic Deep Freeze Base in Christchurch, New Zealand.

While working as a contractor to Raytheon Polar Services in the Denver area from May to August 2005, I found out that Christchurch is the closest airstrip to the U.S. science station at McMurdo. Situated on Ross Island, McMurdo is also the world’s most southernly solid ground accessible by ships.

Clinton toured the American base in Christchurch as well as the nearby International Antarctic Center. He also addressed the staffers at McMurdo using a then-new internet connection. The American politician concluded his Christchurch sojourn with a big speech about the environment and the Antarctic to 5,000 people there which was televised in New Zealand.

From November 17 to mid-December 2013, Britain’s Prince Harry joined the Walking with the Wounded South Pole Allied Challenge (SPAC) charity fundraiser as a member of one of three teams from the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Commonwealth of Nations composed of men and women injured by performing military service. These service personnel actually raced 355km (220mi) from Novolazarevskaya Station in Antarctica to the geographic South Pole.

The SPAC was reportedly “designed to raise awareness about wounded warriors in the U.S. and abroad, specifically those coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan.”

The frigid multi-team expedition was also touted as highlighting “the extraordinary courage and determination of the men and women who have been wounded while serving their countries and to draw attention to the need to help in their career transition.”

Such a justification for a very expensive and difficult enterprise raises more questions than it answers. As one observer wrote, “Frankly, a parade down main street would have been more effective, and therefore I question the story, not that the expedition didn’t happen, but rather, I question the explanation of why it happened.”

The following year, Spain’s King Juan Carlos “fulfilled a long-time ambition in January, 2004 when he finally visited the two Spanish scientific bases in the Antarctic.”

The complete tally of royalty and notables who have undertaken the arduous journey to Antarctica might just surprise you:
• Admiral Richard Byrd (visitor from 1928 to 1956 and leader of the 1947 Operation High Jump who was quoted in El Mercurio of Santiago de Chile about how the U.S. was making defensive preparations against “enemy fighters that can fly from pole to pole with tremendous speed”)
• K. Prince Harry (2013 visitor on a charity fundraiser to highlight wounded soldiers and difficult career transitions)
• King Juan Carlos of Spain (2014 visitor and thrill-seeker checking off an item on his bucket list)
• Russian Orthodox Patriarch of Moscow Kiril (2016 visitor who blessed an Orthodox chapel)
• S. Secretary of State John Kerry (2016 visitor said to be seeking information about climate change)
• S. Apollo 11 Moon astronaut Buzz Aldrin (2016 visitor who tweeted about getting ready to “go to the launchpad” and who subsequently had to be evacuated and quarantined)

In July 2017, news that massive ice shelves in western Antarctica were calving off and falling into the sea surfaced. Could this have something to do with the VIP visitors between 2013 and 2016?

It is this very question that I will address in a near-future article about strange doings in Antarctica.",conspiracy
647,"Of all the discoveries thought by evolutionists to support the idea of human evolution, one of the most sensational is the discovery in 1978 of a 75′ long trail of crisp footprints.

The prints were found in a layer of volcanic ash dated by conventional means to be 3.75 million years old, and assumed to have been made by a human ancestor. Since this date was that of the australopithecine “Lucy,” found in 1974, the discovery was important indeed.



The prints were discovered and defended by the recently deceased Mary Leakey (died December 9, 1996, at the age of 83), Matriarch of the famous fossil hunting Leakey family, whose finds were extensively publicized and funded by National Geographic Magazine. 



Mary Leakey was a tireless worker, whose careful research stands as some of the least controversial in a vicious, ego-laden, funding-driven, field of “one-upmanship.”



As far as the footprints go, her data are not questioned, but the interpretation of the data illustrates the lengths to which evolutionists will go to avoid questioning man’s supposedly evolutionary ancestry.





The prints themselves are quite human-like “indistinguishable from those of modem humans” (Anderson, New Scientist 98:373, 1983). 



Following extensive research it was concluded that the footprints “resemble those of habitually unshod modem humans…. (If the) footprints were not known to be so old, we would readily conclude that they were made by a member of our genus” (Tuttle, Natural History March 1990).



Because of the dates, the prints have been assigned to Australopithecus afarensis, i.e., Lucy’s kind. But is this valid? Lucy was essentially a chimp. Even discoverer Donald Johansson only claims that Lucy was a chimp that walked somewhat more erect than other chimps. 



The Australopithecus foot was an ape’s foot, with an opposing thumb, and long curved toes just right for climbing in trees, but most unlike a human’s foot. According to researcher Dr. Charles Oxnard in a 1996 interview: 



Why do evolutionists continue to maintain that the chimp-like Lucy made the Laetoli human-like footprints, and that both represent our ancestors? Well, it’s certainly not for scientific reasons. The drive to prove man’s animal ancestry is great, for it frees one from accountability to a creator-God.





Thus we see that it is the creationists, not the evolutionists who are the empirical scientists. A human footprint must be made by a human foot!



My evolutionary colleagues could take a cue from Mary Leakey. While a thorough-going evolutionist herself, believing fully in man’s descent from the apes, she had a more cautious approach to the scientific data and especially speculative theory. In an Associated Press interview three months before her death, she “agreed it was impossible for scientists ever to pinpoint exactly when prehistoric man became fully human. 



“We shall probably never know where humans began and where hominids left off” she said. Since scientists can never prove a particular scenario of human evolution, Leakey said ‘all these trees of life with their branches of our ancestors, that’s a lot of nonsense.'”

When construction is completed in 2013, the heavily fortified $2 billion facility will encompass 1 million square feet, including four 25,000-square-foot areas to house endless rows of high-powered servers. The center will be fed data collected by the agency’s eavesdropping satellites, overseas listening posts, and secret monitoring rooms in telecom facilities throughout the US.

The incredible processing power of this facility will be used to scan e-mails, phone calls, text messages, tweets or any other kind of communication. As a former NSA officer states in his article, while holding his thumb and forefinger close together “We are that far from a turnkey totalitarian state.” Here’s an article from Wired about this massive facility.

The NSA Is Building the Country’s Biggest Spy Center (Watch What You Say)

The spring air in the small, sand-dusted town has a soft haze to it, and clumps of green-gray sagebrush rustle in the breeze. Bluffdale sits in a bowl-shaped valley in the shadow of Utah’s Wasatch Range to the east and the Oquirrh Mountains to the west. It’s the heart of Mormon country, where religious pioneers first arrived more than 160 years ago. They came to escape the rest of the world, to understand the mysterious words sent down from their god as revealed on buried golden plates, and to practice what has become known as “the principle,” marriage to multiple wives.

Today Bluffdale is home to one of the nation’s largest sects of polygamists, the Apostolic United Brethren, with upwards of 9,000 members. The brethren’s complex includes a chapel, a school, a sports field, and an archive. Membership has doubled since 1978—and the number of plural marriages has tripled—so the sect has recently been looking for ways to purchase more land and expand throughout the town.

But new pioneers have quietly begun moving into the area, secretive outsiders who say little and keep to themselves. Like the pious polygamists, they are focused on deciphering cryptic messages that only they have the power to understand. Just off Beef Hollow Road, less than a mile from brethren headquarters, thousands of hard-hatted construction workers in sweat-soaked T-shirts are laying the groundwork for the newcomers’ own temple and archive, a massive complex so large that it necessitated expanding the town’s boundaries. Once built, it will be more than five times the size of the US Capitol.

Rather than Bibles, prophets, and worshippers, this temple will be filled with servers, computer intelligence experts, and armed guards. And instead of listening for words flowing down from heaven, these newcomers will be secretly capturing, storing, and analyzing vast quantities of words and images hurtling through the world’s telecommunications networks. In the little town of Bluffdale, Big Love and Big Brother have become uneasy neighbors.

Under construction by contractors with top-secret clearances, the blandly named Utah Data Center is being built for the National Security Agency. A project of immense secrecy, it is the final piece in a complex puzzle assembled over the past decade. Its purpose: to intercept, decipher, analyze, and store vast swaths of the world’s communications as they zap down from satellites and zip through the underground and undersea cables of international, foreign, and domestic networks. The heavily fortified $2 billion center should be up and running in September 2013. Flowing through its servers and routers and stored in near-bottomless databases will be all forms of communication, including the complete contents of private emails, cell phone calls, and Google searches, as well as all sorts of personal data trails—parking receipts, travel itineraries, bookstore purchases, and other digital “pocket litter.” It is, in some measure, the realization of the “total information awareness” program created during the first term of the Bush administration—an effort that was killed by Congress in 2003 after it caused an outcry over its potential for invading Americans’ privacy.

But “this is more than just a data center,” says one senior intelligence official who until recently was involved with the program. The mammoth Bluffdale center will have another important and far more secret role that until now has gone unrevealed. It is also critical, he says, for breaking codes. And code-breaking is crucial, because much of the data that the center will handle—financial information, stock transactions, business deals, foreign military and diplomatic secrets, legal documents, confidential personal communications—will be heavily encrypted. According to another top official also involved with the program, the NSA made an enormous breakthrough several years ago in its ability to cryptanalyze, or break, unfathomably complex encryption systems employed by not only governments around the world but also many average computer users in the US. The upshot, according to this official: “Everybody’s a target; everybody with communication is a target.”

For the NSA, overflowing with tens of billions of dollars in post-9/11 budget awards, the cryptanalysis breakthrough came at a time of explosive growth, in size as well as in power. Established as an arm of the Department of Defense following Pearl Harbor, with the primary purpose of preventing another surprise assault, the NSA suffered a series of humiliations in the post-Cold War years. Caught offguard by an escalating series of terrorist attacks—the first World Trade Center bombing, the blowing up of US embassies in East Africa, the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen, and finally the devastation of 9/11—some began questioning the agency’s very reason for being. In response, the NSA has quietly been reborn. And while there is little indication that its actual effectiveness has improved—after all, despite numerous pieces of evidence and intelligence-gathering opportunities, it missed the near-disastrous attempted attacks by the underwear bomber on a flight to Detroit in 2009 and by the car bomber in Times Square in 2010—there is no doubt that it has transformed itself into the largest, most covert, and potentially most intrusive intelligence agency ever created.

In the process—and for the first time since Watergate and the other scandals of the Nixon administration—the NSA has turned its surveillance apparatus on the US and its citizens. It has established listening posts throughout the nation to collect and sift through billions of email messages and phone calls, whether they originate within the country or overseas. It has created a supercomputer of almost unimaginable speed to look for patterns and unscramble codes. Finally, the agency has begun building a place to store all the trillions of words and thoughts and whispers captured in its electronic net. And, of course, it’s all being done in secret. To those on the inside, the old adage that NSA stands for Never Say Anything applies more than ever.

A swath of freezing fog blanketed Salt Lake City on the morning of January 6, 2011, mixing with a weeklong coating of heavy gray smog. Red air alerts, warning people to stay indoors unless absolutely necessary, had become almost daily occurrences, and the temperature was in the bone-chilling twenties. “What I smell and taste is like coal smoke,” complained one local blogger that day. At the city’s international airport, many inbound flights were delayed or diverted while outbound regional jets were grounded. But among those making it through the icy mist was a figure whose gray suit and tie made him almost disappear into the background. He was tall and thin, with the physique of an aging basketball player and dark caterpillar eyebrows beneath a shock of matching hair. Accompanied by a retinue of bodyguards, the man was NSA deputy director Chris Inglis, the agency’s highest-ranking civilian and the person who ran its worldwide day-to-day operations.

A short time later, Inglis arrived in Bluffdale at the site of the future data center, a flat, unpaved runway on a little-used part of Camp Williams, a National Guard training site. There, in a white tent set up for the occasion, Inglis joined Harvey Davis, the agency’s associate director for installations and logistics, and Utah senator Orrin Hatch, along with a few generals and politicians in a surreal ceremony. Standing in an odd wooden sandbox and holding gold-painted shovels, they made awkward jabs at the sand and thus officially broke ground on what the local media had simply dubbed “the spy center.” Hoping for some details on what was about to be built, reporters turned to one of the invited guests, Lane Beattie of the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce. Did he have any idea of the purpose behind the new facility in his backyard? “Absolutely not,” he said with a self-conscious half laugh. “Nor do I want them spying on me.”

For his part, Inglis simply engaged in a bit of double-talk, emphasizing the least threatening aspect of the center: “It’s a state-of-the-art facility designed to support the intelligence community in its mission to, in turn, enable and protect the nation’s cybersecurity.” While cybersecurity will certainly be among the areas focused on in Bluffdale, what is collected, how it’s collected, and what is done with the material are far more important issues. Battling hackers makes for a nice cover—it’s easy to explain, and who could be against it? Then the reporters turned to Hatch, who proudly described the center as “a great tribute to Utah,” then added, “I can’t tell you a lot about what they’re going to be doing, because it’s highly classified.”

And then there was this anomaly: Although this was supposedly the official ground-breaking for the nation’s largest and most expensive cybersecurity project, no one from the Department of Homeland Security, the agency responsible for protecting civilian networks from cyberattack, spoke from the lectern. In fact, the official who’d originally introduced the data center, at a press conference in Salt Lake City in October 2009, had nothing to do with cybersecurity. It was Glenn A. Gaffney, deputy director of national intelligence for collection, a man who had spent almost his entire career at the CIA. As head of collection for the intelligence community, he managed the country’s human and electronic spies.

Within days, the tent and sandbox and gold shovels would be gone and Inglis and the generals would be replaced by some 10,000 construction workers. “We’ve been asked not to talk about the project,” Rob Moore, president of Big-D Construction, one of the three major contractors working on the project, told a local reporter. The plans for the center show an extensive security system: an elaborate $10 million antiterrorism protection program, including a fence designed to stop a 15,000-pound vehicle traveling 50 miles per hour, closed-circuit cameras, a biometric identification system, a vehicle inspection facility, and a visitor-control center.

Inside, the facility will consist of four 25,000-square-foot halls filled with servers, complete with raised floor space for cables and storage. In addition, there will be more than 900,000 square feet for technical support and administration. The entire site will be self-sustaining, with fuel tanks large enough to power the backup generators for three days in an emergency, water storage with the capability of pumping 1.7 million gallons of liquid per day, as well as a sewage system and massive air-conditioning system to keep all those servers cool. Electricity will come from the center’s own substation built by Rocky Mountain Power to satisfy the 65-megawatt power demand. Such a mammoth amount of energy comes with a mammoth price tag—about $40 million a year, according to one estimate.

Given the facility’s scale and the fact that a terabyte of data can now be stored on a flash drive the size of a man’s pinky, the potential amount of information that could be housed in Bluffdale is truly staggering. But so is the exponential growth in the amount of intelligence data being produced every day by the eavesdropping sensors of the NSA and other intelligence agencies. As a result of this “expanding array of theater airborne and other sensor networks,” as a 2007 Department of Defense report puts it, the Pentagon is attempting to expand its worldwide communications network, known as the Global Information Grid, to handle yottabytes (1024 bytes) of data. (A yottabyte is a septillion bytes—so large that no one has yet coined a term for the next higher magnitude.)

It needs that capacity because, according to a recent report by Cisco, global Internet traffic will quadruple from 2010 to 2015, reaching 966 exabytes per year. (A million exabytes equal a yottabyte.) In terms of scale, Eric Schmidt, Google’s former CEO, once estimated that the total of all human knowledge created from the dawn of man to 2003 totaled 5 exabytes. And the data flow shows no sign of slowing. In 2011 more than 2 billion of the world’s 6.9 billion people were connected to the Internet. By 2015, market research firm IDC estimates, there will be 2.7 billion users. Thus, the NSA’s need for a 1-million-square-foot data storehouse. Should the agency ever fill the Utah center with a yottabyte of information, it would be equal to about 500 quintillion (500,000,000,000,000,000,000) pages of text.

The data stored in Bluffdale will naturally go far beyond the world’s billions of public web pages. The NSA is more interested in the so-called invisible web, also known as the deep web or deepnet—data beyond the reach of the public. This includes password-protected data, US and foreign government communications, and noncommercial file-sharing between trusted peers. “The deep web contains government reports, databases, and other sources of information of high value to DOD and the intelligence community,” according to a 2010 Defense Science Board report. “Alternative tools are needed to find and index data in the deep web … Stealing the classified secrets of a potential adversary is where the [intelligence] community is most comfortable.” With its new Utah Data Center, the NSA will at last have the technical capability to store, and rummage through, all those stolen secrets. The question, of course, is how the agency defines who is, and who is not, “a potential adversary.”

Before yottabytes of data from the deep web and elsewhere can begin piling up inside the servers of the NSA’s new center, they must be collected. To better accomplish that, the agency has undergone the largest building boom in its history, including installing secret electronic monitoring rooms in major US telecom facilities. Controlled by the NSA, these highly secured spaces are where the agency taps into the US communications networks, a practice that came to light during the Bush years but was never acknowledged by the agency. The broad outlines of the so-called warrantless-wiretapping program have long been exposed—how the NSA secretly and illegally bypassed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which was supposed to oversee and authorize highly targeted domestic eavesdropping; how the program allowed wholesale monitoring of millions of American phone calls and email. In the wake of the program’s exposure, Congress passed the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which largely made the practices legal. Telecoms that had agreed to participate in the illegal activity were granted immunity from prosecution and lawsuits. What wasn’t revealed until now, however, was the enormity of this ongoing domestic spying program.

For the first time, a former NSA official has gone on the record to describe the program, codenamed Stellar Wind, in detail. William Binney was a senior NSA crypto-mathematician largely responsible for automating the agency’s worldwide eavesdropping network. A tall man with strands of black hair across the front of his scalp and dark, determined eyes behind thick-rimmed glasses, the 68-year-old spent nearly four decades breaking codes and finding new ways to channel billions of private phone calls and email messages from around the world into the NSA’s bulging databases. As chief and one of the two cofounders of the agency’s Signals Intelligence Automation Research Center, Binney and his team designed much of the infrastructure that’s still likely used to intercept international and foreign communications.

He explains that the agency could have installed its tapping gear at the nation’s cable landing stations—the more than two dozen sites on the periphery of the US where fiber-optic cables come ashore. If it had taken that route, the NSA would have been able to limit its eavesdropping to just international communications, which at the time was all that was allowed under US law. Instead it chose to put the wiretapping rooms at key junction points throughout the country—large, windowless buildings known as switches—thus gaining access to not just international communications but also to most of the domestic traffic flowing through the US. The network of intercept stations goes far beyond the single room in an AT&T building in San Francisco exposed by a whistle-blower in 2006. “I think there’s 10 to 20 of them,” Binney says. “That’s not just San Francisco; they have them in the middle of the country and also on the East Coast.”

The eavesdropping on Americans doesn’t stop at the telecom switches. To capture satellite communications in and out of the US, the agency also monitors AT&T’s powerful earth stations, satellite receivers in locations that include Roaring Creek and Salt Creek. Tucked away on a back road in rural Catawissa, Pennsylvania, Roaring Creek’s three 105-foot dishes handle much of the country’s communications to and from Europe and the Middle East. And on an isolated stretch of land in remote Arbuckle, California, three similar dishes at the company’s Salt Creek station service the Pacific Rim and Asia.

Binney left the NSA in late 2001, shortly after the agency launched its warrantless-wiretapping program. “They violated the Constitution setting it up,” he says bluntly. “But they didn’t care. They were going to do it anyway, and they were going to crucify anyone who stood in the way. When they started violating the Constitution, I couldn’t stay.” Binney says Stellar Wind was far larger than has been publicly disclosed and included not just eavesdropping on domestic phone calls but the inspection of domestic email. At the outset the program recorded 320 million calls a day, he says, which represented about 73 to 80 percent of the total volume of the agency’s worldwide intercepts. The haul only grew from there. According to Binney—who has maintained close contact with agency employees until a few years ago—the taps in the secret rooms dotting the country are actually powered by highly sophisticated software programs that conduct “deep packet inspection,” examining Internet traffic as it passes through the 10-gigabit-per-second cables at the speed of light.

The software, created by a company called Narus that’s now part of Boeing, is controlled remotely from NSA headquarters at Fort Meade in Maryland and searches US sources for target addresses, locations, countries, and phone numbers, as well as watch-listed names, keywords, and phrases in email. Any communication that arouses suspicion, especially those to or from the million or so people on agency watch lists, are automatically copied or recorded and then transmitted to the NSA.

The scope of surveillance expands from there, Binney says. Once a name is entered into the Narus database, all phone calls and other communications to and from that person are automatically routed to the NSA’s recorders. “Anybody you want, route to a recorder,” Binney says. “If your number’s in there? Routed and gets recorded.” He adds, “The Narus device allows you to take it all.” And when Bluffdale is completed, whatever is collected will be routed there for storage and analysis.

According to Binney, one of the deepest secrets of the Stellar Wind program—again, never confirmed until now—was that the NSA gained warrantless access to AT&T’s vast trove of domestic and international billing records, detailed information about who called whom in the US and around the world. As of 2007, AT&T had more than 2.8 trillion records housed in a database at its Florham Park, New Jersey, complex.

Verizon was also part of the program, Binney says, and that greatly expanded the volume of calls subject to the agency’s domestic eavesdropping. “That multiplies the call rate by at least a factor of five,” he says. “So you’re over a billion and a half calls a day.” (Spokespeople for Verizon and AT&T said their companies would not comment on matters of national security.)

After he left the NSA, Binney suggested a system for monitoring people’s communications according to how closely they are connected to an initial target. The further away from the target—say you’re just an acquaintance of a friend of the target—the less the surveillance. But the agency rejected the idea, and, given the massive new storage facility in Utah, Binney suspects that it now simply collects everything. “The whole idea was, how do you manage 20 terabytes of intercept a minute?” he says. “The way we proposed was to distinguish between things you want and things you don’t want.” Instead, he adds, “they’re storing everything they gather.” And the agency is gathering as much as it can.

Once the communications are intercepted and stored, the data-mining begins. “You can watch everybody all the time with data- mining,” Binney says. Everything a person does becomes charted on a graph, “financial transactions or travel or anything,” he says. Thus, as data like bookstore receipts, bank statements, and commuter toll records flow in, the NSA is able to paint a more and more detailed picture of someone’s life.

The NSA also has the ability to eavesdrop on phone calls directly and in real time. According to Adrienne J. Kinne, who worked both before and after 9/11 as a voice interceptor at the NSA facility in Georgia, in the wake of the World Trade Center attacks “basically all rules were thrown out the window, and they would use any excuse to justify a waiver to spy on Americans.” Even journalists calling home from overseas were included. “A lot of time you could tell they were calling their families,” she says, “incredibly intimate, personal conversations.” Kinne found the act of eavesdropping on innocent fellow citizens personally distressing. “It’s almost like going through and finding somebody’s diary,” she says.

But there is, of course, reason for anyone to be distressed about the practice. Once the door is open for the government to spy on US citizens, there are often great temptations to abuse that power for political purposes, as when Richard Nixon eavesdropped on his political enemies during Watergate and ordered the NSA to spy on antiwar protesters. Those and other abuses prompted Congress to enact prohibitions in the mid-1970s against domestic spying.

Before he gave up and left the NSA, Binney tried to persuade officials to create a more targeted system that could be authorized by a court. At the time, the agency had 72 hours to obtain a legal warrant, and Binney devised a method to computerize the system. “I had proposed that we automate the process of requesting a warrant and automate approval so we could manage a couple of million intercepts a day, rather than subvert the whole process.” But such a system would have required close coordination with the courts, and NSA officials weren’t interested in that, Binney says. Instead they continued to haul in data on a grand scale. Asked how many communications—”transactions,” in NSA’s lingo—the agency has intercepted since 9/11, Binney estimates the number at “between 15 and 20 trillion, the aggregate over 11 years.”

When Barack Obama took office, Binney hoped the new administration might be open to reforming the program to address his constitutional concerns. He and another former senior NSA analyst, J. Kirk Wiebe, tried to bring the idea of an automated warrant-approval system to the attention of the Department of Justice’s inspector general. They were given the brush-off. “They said, oh, OK, we can’t comment,” Binney says.

Sitting in a restaurant not far from NSA headquarters, the place where he spent nearly 40 years of his life, Binney held his thumb and forefinger close together. “We are, like, that far from a turnkey totalitarian state,” he says.",conspiracy
1072,"­It is amazing, but the total amount of gold in the world is a surprisingly small q­uantity. Here's how you can calculate the total amount that is available.

If you look at a page like this one, or if you look it up in an encyclopedia, you will find that the annual worldwide production of gold is something like 50 million troy ounces per year. Gold has a specific gravity of 19.3, meaning that it is 19.3 times heavier than water. So gold weighs 19.3 kilograms per liter. A liter is a cube that measures 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) on a side. There are 32.15 troy ounces in a kilogram. Therefore, the world produces a cube of gold that is about 4.3 meters (about 14 feet) on each side every year. In other words, all of the gold produced worldwide in one year could just about fit in the average person's living room!

This cube weighs 1,555,210 kilograms (3,110,420 pounds). A recent spot price for gold was $256.10 U.S. -- using that number, all of the gold produced in a year is worth $12,805,000,000. That's a lot of money, but not an unimaginable amount. For example, that's about how much the Pentagon spent launching the GPS satellite system. NASA's budget in 1998 was $13.6 billion.

Figuring out the total amount of gold that has been produced by man is a little harder. To get at some kind of estimate, let's figure that the world has been producing gold at 50 million ounces a year for 200 years. That number is probably a little high, but when you figure that the Aztecs and the Egyptians produced a fair amount of gold for a long time, it's probably not too far off. Fifty million ounces * 200 years = 10 billion ounces. Ten billion ounces of gold would fit into a cube roughly 25 meters (about 82 feet) on a side. Consider that the Washington Monument measures 55 feet by 55 feet at its base and is 555 feet tall (17 x 17 x 170 m). That means that if you could somehow gather every scrap of gold that man has ever mined into one place, you could only build about one-third of the Washington Monument.

Platinum is even more scarce than gold. Only 3.6 million troy ounces are produced per year. Its specific gravity is 21.45, and it was discovered in the 18th century, not in 3,000 B.C. If you assume that the world has produced 3.6 million ounces per year for 50 years to estimate the total worldwide supply, all of the platinum in the world would fit in a cube that is 6.3 meters (about 20 feet) on a side. In other words, all of the platinum in the entire world would easily fit in the average home!

1253,"Since its release in early 2014, the big-budget movie “Noah” has caused controversy for not being biblically accurate. While that is certainly the case, the movie does more than take liberties with the Bible: “Noah” pushes messages that have nothing to do with the Bible. These messages are actually political and come directly from the world elite. The primary message? Humanity needs to be cleansed … again.

Throughout his movie-making career, Darren Aronofsky has created quite a few controversial movies with a powerful underlying message (see my article on the movie Black Swan here). None of his work can be considered “idiotic” and, despite what critics say, Noah is not an idiotic movie either. Sure, it contains giant stone monsters, primitive bazookas and Noah killing a bunch of poor souls, but the movie is smart enough to effectively communicate several of its core messages, twisting one of the oldest tales in the world to push an agenda that is very 2014.

While many viewers were upset about the many liberties taken in this retelling of Noah’s Ark – a tale that exists in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim literature – the messages added to the story should be even more upsetting. Noah re-formats this ancient tale to describe the basic premise of a new religion, one that has been pushed on the masses for years. Based on the elite’s long-term Agenda of drastically depopulating the Earth, this new religion is about radical environmentalism, the devaluation (and even hatred) of human life, and the re-alignment of morality towards a new axis.

Through its odd narrative, the movie turns the tale of Noah’s Ark into an absurd and disturbing adventure that leads viewers wondering: Why is God so evil? And why is Noah such a jerk? When Noah’s wife asks him if “the Creator” (that’s the name for God in the movie) will help them survive, Noah’s answer is almost comedic, as if he was describing a super-villain:



While the Bible explains that the Great Flood was caused by a mysterious race of Giants corrupting and “infecting” humanity, the movie does not go that route. Instead, it repeatedly tells us that humans are evil and deserve to die.

Before getting into the actual story, I need to point out a detail that is seemingly trivial, but that tells loads about the movie’s true goal: Why is everybody dressed as if they got their clothes from the world’s first Zara store?

These made-for-a-2014-audience outfits basically tell us that Noah is not about the Bible – it is about today. It is a message to humanity right now, directly from the elite.

While the premise of Noah is based on the Biblical story from the book of Genesis, the creators invented characters, subplots, symbols, images, and messages to completely reshape the tale, giving it a twisted, disturbing and wholly “unspiritual” meaning. Even if one watches the movie fully expecting a “creative retelling” of Noah’s Ark, it is difficult to not be disturbed by the bloody, violent, near-psychopathic tangent taken by the main character. I mean, Noah actually kills a bunch of people in the movie! How can that remotely make sense in the divine context of the story? Well, it actually does make sense … when we understand that the movie is meant to sell a new religion dictated by the world elite composed of values it wants the masses to adopt. One of these values is that human life is cancer on Earth that needs to be eradicated. In other words, they want humans to sincerely believe they are evil to justify depopulation. Of course, as the movie tells us, most humans do die … EXCEPT those of the chosen bloodline. And that is what the elite wants us to think. We must all die to save the Earth … except them.

Noah is strikingly similar to another movie analyzed on Vigilant Citizen: 2012. As I noted in this article, 2012 is a disaster movie that is essentially about the rich and powerful people (the elite) surviving a gigantic flood while everyone else dies. The movie was full of references to the tale of Noah’s Ark and even shows helicopters transporting various animals to giant ships. The movie posters of Noah and 2012 are also strikingly similar.

Noah is, therefore, a reconstitution of a biblical story tailor-made to fit the Agenda continually being pushed by the elite … and as usual, the Agenda is rather upsetting. It promotes the idea of massively depopulating the Earth and sells it as an ecological mission. Extreme environmentalism is the new religion being sold to the masses through fear.

This religion is not only promoted in works of fiction, it is found in real life monuments. The Georgia Guidestones is a gigantic collection of stones (dubbed America’s Stonehenge) on which are laid out ten NEW commandments.

In the article I wrote about the Guidestones, I explain that it was built by members of occult secret societies. The last commandment of the stones sums up the main message of the movie Noah:

In Noah, it is explained that humanity needs to be extinct because it is disrespectful to nature. That is not what is said in the Bible, but that is the message this movie (and the elite) wants you to absorb.

Right from the first scenes of the movie, Noah (dressed in his little Zara outfit) talks to his kids about hardcore environmental concepts that were probably the last thing on people’s minds in these very ancient times. When Noah’s son sees a pretty flower and tries to pick it, Noah jumps in to stop the senseless destruction.

That little scene announces Noah’s rather extreme brand of environmentalism. A little later, Noah sees “men” (a pejorative term in the movie) hunting an animal in order to eat it. Noah runs to the rescue of the animal and stabs one of the men in the leg. He then calls his act of violence “justice”. Yes, Noah is apparently an extreme vegan who stabs people who eat meat.

When Noah’s son asks him why these evil men believe that eating meat gives them strength, he replies:

This, of course, is not found in the Bible. It is part of the movie’s message that basically says “Animals > Humans”. Throughout the movie, Noah refers to animals as “the innocent” while humans are perceived as scum who deserve to die. Noah, however, seems to forget that many animals are carnivorous beasts who spend most of their time hunting and devouring other animals. Some might say: That is what God intended.

At one point Noah tells his children:

Throughout the movie, Noah, the “hero of the movie” displays absolute hatred for humanity and avoids it at all costs. Every time he sees “men” or man-created structures, he automatically becomes worried.

Twisting the Biblical Bit About the Giants

To further its anti-humanity message, the movie significantly twists and contorts Biblical passages about a mysterious race called the Giants found in the book of Genesis. In the Bible, the Giants are offsprings of a group of 200 “Sons of God” who descended to Earth to mix with humans. They are said to have taught humans advanced skills such as metallurgy, metal working, cosmetics, sorcery, astrology, astronomy, and meteorology. Because the Giants disobeyed God, they were also called the Fallen Angels. (Interesting note: Lucifer is also referred to as a Fallen Angel and is said to have brought forbidden knowledge to men).

In the book of Genesis, it is said that the Giants (also called the Nephilim) were a hybrid race of sons of God and human females.

The Nephilim are described in the Bible (and other apocryphal texts) as a race of giants who lived among humans. They ultimately became a destructive presence and were said to have consumed “all acquisitions of men”. In order to rid these beings from Earth (along with the humans who mixed with them) God caused the Great Flood.

The Bible, therefore, describes the Giants as the main cause of humanity’s corruption. The movie, however, portrays the exact opposite. In Noah, the Giants are described as gentle teachers who came to aid humans, but ultimately became victims of humanity’s cruelty. Later, Giants actually help Noah build the Ark! In short, the movie inverted important parts of the Bible to say that humanity is solely responsible for its demise because it had evolved into a state that was beyond repair. The movie also makes it clear that its anti-humanity message is still applicable today.

In one significant part of the movie, Noah tells his family the “first story he ever heard”. It begins with the first line of the Bible “In the beginning, there was light” but then devolves into a grim speech about the evils of humanity.

The movie, therefore, pushes the viewers to conclude that humanity is, once again, beyond hope. Massive depopulation is therefore not a horrible catastrophe but a necessary “cleansing process”. Noah himself says:

This line is not from the Bible. It comes from the minds of psychopaths who want to depopulate the Earth and describing it as a “cleansing process”. Depopulation is good. Death equals cleansing.

In the end, Noah realizes that not all humanity needs to die after the flood: His family survives. And there lies another important message of the movie: Depopulation does not apply to all humanity. It only applies to those who are not part of the “chosen” bloodline. This is the kind of the message the occult elite wants us to assimilate because they believe THEY are the chosen bloodline.

It’s All About the Bloodline

Spoiler alert: Noah and his family survive the Great Flood. But no one else does. Right from the beginning of the movie, we are told that the survival of humanity must go through a specific bloodline. Viewers immediately learn that Noah descends from Seth while the bad guys descend from Cain – a fact that is apparently VERY important.

Of course, none of this is mentioned in the Bible. It is one of the many fabrications added to flesh out the story and to give it a specific angle: God favors a specific bloodline.

Later in the movie, Noah’s father, Methuselah, is depicted as a reclusive but supernatural being who magically guides Noah through the Creator’s plan. While Methuselah was never mentioned in the Bible as having a role in the construction of the Ark, this addition strengthens the idea of the bloodline.

There are other strange “non-Biblical” additions to the movie that ultimately makes us think that Noah is not a “man of God”, but a jerk who only wants to see his bloodline survive. For instance: Noah actually kills a bunch of people.

In another gut-wrenching (and completely invented) scene, Noah purposely allows his son’s girlfriend to be trampled to death by hundreds of people.

How can a man, that is supposedly chosen by the Creator, allow the death of an innocent girl? Why was this added to the movie? Because it is continuously communicating a message: Whether she was good or not is irrelevant. The girl was not part of the bloodline. Therefore, she must die. It is not about being a good person. It is about who you descend from.

After the flood, Noah turns into a disturbed, depressive, psychopath. When he learns that his daughter-in-law is pregnant, he is convinced that he must kill the little girl to make sure that humanity does not reproduce.

Noah, however, realizes something incredible: He does not feel like stabbing his own granddaughter in the face. Although he first believes that he had let down the Creator by not killing the girl, he ultimately learns that he did the right thing by “showing mercy”. But what about the countless humans he killed? Wasn’t there any mercy for them? No. Because they were not part of the bloodline. The Creator allowed Noah to murder people when they were not “chosen”. Incidentally, that is what the occult elite believes.

The movie depicts Noah’s “divine” quest as a cruel and violent process carried out by a man who is steadily turning into a psychopath. While stranded on the Ark, his own family begins to resent him as he obsesses over the fact that everybody needs to die. While he is merely following the Creator’s orders, he appears to be animated by a deep-seeded hate of humanity, which leaves viewers with an “unholy” feeling. There is, however, a character that counterbalances Noah’s “do it my way or else” doctrine: Tubal-Cain.

Tubal-Cain is the “leader of humans”, and, therefore, Noah’s mortal enemy. While Tubal-Cain is the “bad guy”, he is ironically the character who says the most thoughtful and sensible lines, which causes viewers to somewhat identify with him. Contrarily to Noah, he is not ashamed to be human and is proud of humanity’s accomplishments. Furthermore, he feels somewhat forsaken by the Creator who left his kind to roam a desolate land. He seeks to emancipate himself from the Creator’s rule through his own means. In this sense, he is a representative of a Gnostic point of view that perceives the Creator a demiurge – a lower god who imprisoned mankind in a material world. This is why God is called “the Creator” in the movie. It refers to the Gnostic concept of demiurge, the near-malevolent creator of the material world.

Tubal-Cain is briefly mentioned in the Bible as a “forger of all instruments of bronze and iron” and an “instructor of every artificer in brass and iron”. However, he is never mentioned in the story of the Great Flood and has no link with Noah. So why did the makers of the movie choose this obscure Biblical character to become Noah’s arch-nemesis? Because, while Tubal-Cain is an obscure figure in the Bible, he is an extremely important figure in the most widespread Gnostic Mystery School on Earth: Freemasonry.

Not unlike Hiram Abiff (a leading figure in Masonic lore and ritual), Tubal-Cain is an obscure Biblical figure who takes a great importance in esoteric teachings. As a proficient maker of weapons, he represents humanity’s potential to build its own power – without the Creator. Various Masonic sources describe the esoteric significance of Tubal-Cain.

In Manly P. Hall’s “The Lost Keys of Freemasonry”, Tubal-Cain is described as the “forefather” of Freemasons.

Mystery Schools love Biblical characters who did not rely on God to gain knowledge and power. Tubal-Cain is a prime example. In Noah, Tubal-Cain attempts to communicate with the Creator – not as a servant, like Noah, but as an equal.

Although Tubal-Cain realizes that humanity is about to be wiped away, he finds an unexpected person to carry on his legacy: Noah’s own son, Ham.

Throughout Noah’s quest, Ham feels ignored, rejected and infantilized. He feels that he cannot become a man without being with a woman – a right that is denied by his father. Tired of being punished and humiliated, Ham leaves the Ark and mixes with the “nasty” humans. There, he finds a “good girl” he wants to marry. However, Noah leaves her to die and drags Ham back to the Ark by force.

When Ham meets Tubal-Cain, he finds the kind of father figure he has been looking for. Instead of a life of blind servitude, Tubal-Cain offered Ham the means to be a “real” man. During the flood, Tubal-Cain found a way to sneak inside the Ark and, while hidden with the animals, he “initiated” Ham to his philosophy.

While these words were said by the “bad guy”, he was nearly quoting actual Biblical verses. This only adds to the movie’s general confusion and mixed messages.

Tubal-Cain then ultimately urges Ham to kill his father:

Ham does not kill his father … he kills Tubal-Cain. However, this fateful act does not seem to bother Tubal-Cain. To the contrary, he knows that, by killing him, Ham has successfully completed his initiation. While dying, Tubal-Cain tells Ham:

After surviving the flood, Ham does not reintegrate with Noah’s family. He leaves them behind and makes his own path.

We don’t know if Ham managed to reproduce (probably not). However, we do know that, in the Bible, the story that immediately follows Noah’s Ark is the story of the Tower of Babel – a gigantic tower built by humans to “fight God”. It appears that the Great Flood did not “cleanse” anything and that Tubal-Cain’s lineage survived the Flood after all.

In the Bible, the story of Noah’s Ark is told in a few simple verses and is filled with enigmatic bits that are never explained (i.e. who were the Giants exactly?). The movie Noah fills in the answers to some of these questions in its own way by augmenting the Biblical tale with fabricated stories and characters, ultimately giving this ancient story a very modern twist. The same way Russell Crowe’s snazzy outfits were tailor-made for a 2014 audience, the messages in Noah were also tailor-made for a 2014 audience.

The movie basically presents two philosophical views: One that is meant for the ignorant masses and one that is meant for “those in the know”. The ignorant masses are told to follow a radical brand of environmentalism that leads to self-hatred: Because humanity is the evil force behind war, suffering and the destruction of nature, it needs to be “cleansed”. This message fits with the occult elite’s depopulation Agenda and is embodied by Noah. At the other end of the spectrum, Tubal-Cain represents humans seeking godhood, acquiring the physical and mental tools to reach the same status as the Creator. This is the Gnostic philosophy adopted by the occult elite. While embodied by the “bad guy”, it is nevertheless presented as an alternative to the absurdity of the Creator who created humanity to then destroy it.

In short, Noah is far from an “idiotic” movie (as some reviewers have stated). It manages to sell a New Age religion based on self-hatred while giving a nod to the occult elite, those who fancy themselves to be descendants of Tubal-Cain. But the occult elite does not believe in radical environmentalism OR care about human life. They are the ones behind all our major wars and their greed is the main cause of nature’s destruction. Through movie’s like Noah, they are trying to put the burden of their own wrongdoings on the unsuspecting masses who usually do as they are told. They want us to welcome the idea of a “great cleansing”.

In the Bible, after the Great Flood, God himself states :

So, whether you believe in the Bible or not, know that if there is another major “cleansing” on Earth, it will not come from “the Creator”. It will come from those who have brainwashed you for years, convincing you to believe you are a cancer on Earth.",conspiracy

190,"To understand these differences, we need to explore the biomechanics of running, which can be divided into two major components: running kinematics, the way in which the body moves, and running kinetics, the relationship between movements and the forces that cause them. To understand the important kinetic differences between different kinds of foot strikes we will first consider key differences in running kinematics. Note that there is a continuum of different kinds of landings from landing on the heel (heel striking), landing simultaneously on the heel and ball of the foot (midfoot striking), and landing on the ball of the foot (forefoot striking). Again, for simplicity, we focus here on heel and forefoot striking, noting that midfoot striking is often intermediate.

The explanations below illustrate how and why a large collision is generated when heel striking and why such a small collision is generated when forefoot striking.

Here we focus on the difference between heel striking and forefoot striking (see bottom of page for more on midfoot striking which is often intermediate). In heel striking, the collision of the heel with the ground generates a significant impact transient, a nearly instantaneous, large force. This force sends a shock wave up through the body via the skeletal system. In forefoot striking, the collision of the forefoot with the ground generates a very minimal impact force with no impact transient.

The physics of collisions: The impact of the body with the ground generates an impact force, which equals mass times acceleration 

 (F = ma, Newton’s 2nd Law). The mass involved in this collision is whatever portion of the body that comes to a dead stop along with the point of impact on the foot (this is called the effective mass). The acceleration is the rate of change of this mass' velocity. Because the impact occurs over a brief period of time, the force times the duration of the collision, called the impulse, is the effective mass times its change in velocity over the duration of the impact. For a detailed explanation of the physics, see equation 1 in Lieberman et al (2010). Foot and lower leg come to a dead stop at impact while the rest of the body continues to fall above the knee. Forefoot comes to a dead stop, but the heel and lower leg continue to fall (in a forefoot strike). The ankle flexes (in both forefoot and midfoot strikes). Effective mass is approximately the foot plus the lower leg, which equals 6.8% of total body mass in the runners measured in Lieberman et al. (2010). Effective mass is the forefoot and some portion of the rearfoot and leg, which equals 1.7% of total body mass in the runners measured in Lieberman et al. (2010). The change in velocity of the effective mass is the difference between the velocity of the falling foot at the instant before contact and the velocity just after contact, which is zero. This change in velocity does not differ significantly between a heel strike and a forefoot strike. Although the ankle may flex a little (plantarflex) during the impact period, the vertical momentum of the lower leg is mostly absorbed by the vertical component of the collision force. Much of the vertical momentum of the rearfoot and lower leg is converted into rotational momentum. Analogy: It is like dropping a rod straight down on its end: it comes to a sudden, loud stop. Analogy: It is like dropping a rod on its end at an angle: there is a sudden stop at one end of the rod, but it is much less loud because the rest of the rod continues to fall as it topples over. This kind of collision leads to a rapid, high impact transient about 1.5 to as much as 3 times your body weight (depending on your speed) within 50 milliseconds of striking the ground (see graph a below).

 

 This is equivalent to someone hitting you on the heel with a hammer using 1.5 to as much as 3 times your body weight. These impacts add up, since you strike the ground almost 1000 times per mile!

 

 Many running shoes make heel strikes comfortable and less injurious because they slow the rate of loading considerably, reduce the force by about 10% (see graph b below) and spread this force out over a greater area of the foot. But they do not eliminate the impact transient. This kind of collision produces a very slow rise in force with no distinct impact transient. There is ESSENTIALLY NO IMPACT TRANSIENT in a forefoot strike (see graph c below). The same is true of some (but not all) midfoot strikes.

 

 We have found that even on hard surfaces (a steel force plate) runners who forefoot strike have impact forces that are 7 times lower than shod runners who heel strike. Rates of loading are equal to or less than rates of loading for shod runners. Note that the peak force at midstance is the same for both kinds of gaits. This peak reflects the ground reaction force when the body's center of mass is at its lowest point. Because peak force at midstance rises slowly, it is probably less related to injury. Some runners land simultaneously on the ball of the foot and the heel. Midfoot strikes represent a continuum between heel strikes and forefoot strikes, depending on where the center of pressure is at impact and how stiff the ankle and knee are during impact. One can land softly in a midfoot strike without much impact transient, but some midfoot strikes can generate impact transients like those of heel strikes. However, these forces are distributed over larger surfaces areas, reducing the stress on the foot.",mainstream
25,"Danish diabetes drug maker Novo Nordisk is pumping an additional $65 million into the finished products plant in Clayton, North Carolina, even as it builds a $2 billion API facility there.

The latest expansion is expected to add 18 employees to the 1,000 that already work in Johnston County, North Carolina, and the 700 new employees likely to work at the API facility when it opens, a Novo spokesman said, confirming an announcement by Johnston County Economic Development.

The ingredients facility Novo is building, which was announced in 2016 and is the company’s first API facility in the U.S., is designed to meet needs for more capacity, Chad Henry, VP and general manager for the facility, told the Triangle Business Journal. Novo is slated to get $1.9 million in incentives from the county over the next 13 years.

Construction on that plant kicked off in March of 2016 and marked the company’s first API facility outside of Denmark. The 833,000-square-foot project has a facility footprint of 417,639 square feet, roughly the size of seven football fields. It is located next to the finished products manufacturing plant that is 457,000 square feet and handles formulation, filling and packaging of diabetes medication.

The API plant is forecast to be completed in 2020 and will manufacture active ingredients for oral semaglutide, its experimental daily oral treatment for Type 2 diabetes, as well as other current and future Novo insulin products.

The company is also building a new production facility in Måløv, Denmark, that will handle tableting and packaging of oral semaglutide as well as other oral medications.",mainstream
85,"The part of the fossil assemblage Stw573 consisting of some medial foot bones was initially reported by Clarke & Tobias (Science 269 (2002) 521). They found it to have both ape- and human-like qualities, being human-like proximally and ape-like distally. We have undertaken a re-examination of this pedal assemblage using a multivariate analysis; while we also found ape- and human-like qualities, they are in direct conflict with the original findings of Clarke and Tobias. We report an essentially ape-like morphology proximally and a human-like morphology distally; the talus and navicular were found to be ape-like and the medial cuneiform human-like. We also undertook a morphometric analysis of the medial cuneiform from the fossil assemblage OH8, as this was not included in the original OH8 study of Kidd et al (J Hum Evol 31 (1996) 269); this cuneiform was found to have a human-like morphology. Thus, the medial column findings from the two assemblages are very similar. This finding, coupled with the re-evaluation of the stratigraphy at Sterkfontein (Am J Phys Anthrop 119 (2002) 192), suggests that the two may have been contemporaneous.

We also note that three broad patterns of modification have been identified, equating to proximal–distal lateral–medial (cranio–caudal) and dorsal–plantar (posterior–anterior). It has not escaped our notice that these patterns are each controlled by specific genes or growth factors; we thus see a morphometric expression of our developmental past.",mainstream
239,"For the first time since Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected in 1932, a major-party presidential candidate wants to reduce inequality.

Bernie Sanders proposes raising taxes on rich people and corporations, doubling the minimum wage, investing $1 trillion in infrastructure, ending NAFTA/CAFTA/PNTR/TPP “free trade for billionaires,” investing $5.5 billion in a youth jobs program creating one million new jobs, and passing a host of other programs that would significantly raise the standard of living for average Americans – while siphoning wealth and power out of the hands of the 1%.

A Bernie Sanders presidency could reverse the exponentially-escalating trend towards economic inequity. It could save the American middle class, and prevent the USA – and perhaps the world – from becoming a slave plantation run by billionaire overseers lording it over a powerless and increasingly impoverished population of “useless eaters.”

Bernie’s ambitious plans for big domestic projects would necessitate a major cut in military spending. The US would have to end its Middle East and Afghan wars, cut many of its wasteful pork-barrel weapons programs, and begin to withdraw from its 900 official and unofficial military bases in 130 foreign nations.

Bernie’s supporters are excited and optimistic, for good reason. Sanders’ stunning series of upsets over the bankster-puppet war criminal Hillary Clinton could be a harbinger of significant positive change.

But Bernie’s supporters shouldn’t be naïve. The corporate elite is unlikely to simply roll over and relinquish its privileged position.

In my 2008 book Questioning the War on Terror: A Primer for Obama Voters, I argued that the mere election of the seemingly progressive Barrack Obama would change nothing – unless the people wised up to the elite’s dirty tricks, mobilized, and forced change on their recalcitrant leadership. Most importantly, the people would have to expose the fraudulent “war on terror” in order to clear the way for real change.

It is now 2016. The phony war on terror continues, and Obama – like the rest of us – is its prisoner. Obscenely bloated military and security budgets are untouchable. Constitutional liberty is a dead letter. The economy is booming for banksters, investors and war profiteers, even as Main Street dies. Republican demagogues direct popular anger away from the criminal elite, towards darker-skinned foreign scapegoats.

Now imagine that the same hopey-changey multitudes who helped elect Obama somehow succeed, despite a totally rigged system, and put Bernie Sanders in the White House. Best-case scenario: It’s a landslide. Congress is Democratic. A huge pro-Bernie youth movement is making noise and demanding the changes they voted for.

What happens next?

The bastards – excuse me, I mean “the terrorists” – just blew up the Sears Tower and set off dirty bombs all over Chicago. A heroic Rahm Emmanuel struts across TV screens, starring in the same role Rudy Giuliani played on 9/11.

Suddenly Bernie looks like a frail old geriatric socialist, not the heroic, hairy-chested “you’re either with us or against us” alpha male leader everyone’s demanding.

Suddenly everyone has forgotten about Bernie’s “reduce inequality” proposals.

Suddenly the whole nation is clamoring for revenge.

No more talk of the 99% versus the 1%. Now it’s United We Stand! Throw money at the military! Expand surveillance! Torture suspects! Shred what’s left of the Constitution! Invade foreign lands that may or may not be linked to the atrocity! And then in 2018, swamp Congress with hairy-chested Muslim-hating neocon-Republican apes!

The whole Bernie Sanders agenda is dead in the water. It will be a long time before anything like it ever happens again.

I have seen the future: A boot stamping on a human face for eternity.

What I have just described is the best case scenario (landslide Sanders victory) followed by the worst case scenario (9/11-scale “terrorist attack”). I did this to starkly outline to problem, to make it easily visible.

But the Sanders agenda could just as easily be sabotaged in less-extreme scenarios. For example, a series of smaller “terrorist attacks” prior to the election could sabotage Sanders’ chances of winning. Or a similar series after the election could undermine his mandate.

Think the US elite wouldn’t stage murderous false-flag “terrorist attacks” to control the outcomes of elections – specifically, to prevent the election of honest, independent left-wingers like Bernie Sanders – or to control policy? Think again. That is precisely what the American military leadership, in cahoots with the money power, did throughout the Cold War period in Europe.

Daniel Ganser’s book NATO’s Secret Armies documents the horrors of Operation Gladio – a NATO program, commanded by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and Gen. Lyman Lemnitzer, that terrorized Europeans by bombing and shooting them en masse in false flag terror attacks blamed on left-wingers. Gladio-sponsored atrocities included the mass shootings of innocents in Belgian streets and supermarkets; the bombing of the Bologna train station (85 dead, 200 injured); and the kidnapping and murder of Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro.

Ganser’s research has never been challenged. His findings were affirmed by the European Parliament. There are no “debunkers” even bothering to try to claim that Operation Gladio never existed.

And yet none of the higher-ups responsible for Gladio terrorism have ever been prosecuted. Only lower-level flunkies like Vincenzo Vinciguerra ever served prison time. (Vinceguerra famously confessed to his role in the false flag crime wave, saying: “You had to attack civilians, the people, women, children, innocent people, unknown people far removed from any political game. The reason was quite simple: to force ... the public to turn to the state to ask for greater security."")

FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds has revealed that Operation Gladio continues today, under the rubric of “Gladio B.” Instead of left-wingers, Muslims are the scapegoats. But blaming Muslims for government-sponsored false flag terror attacks is just as effective as blaming left-wingers, if the objective is to prevent people like Bernie Sanders from implementing a progressive agenda.

That is why Bernie Sanders supporters need to understand the problem of false flag terrorism. And they need to proactively spread the word.

Of all of the many forms of information activism, raising public consciousness about state-sponsored false flag terrorism is perhaps the most important and effective. If the public understands that whatever “official story” being peddled in the wake of a major terror event is probably a lie concocted by the real perpetrators, it will not be stampeded into war and tyranny. The false flag will fail. It may even backfire.

One major “false flag fail” came on May 11th, 2004, when Gladio B operatives bombed commuter trains in Madrid, Spain, killing 192 people and injuring 2000. The purpose: Re-elect pro-Iraq-War Prime Minister José Maria Aznar, give his government tyrannical emergency powers, demonize Basque independence forces as well as Muslims, and push the hyper-authoritarian Spanish government deeper into Iraq.

But the Spanish people did not react the way the perpetrators had expected. Instead of being terrorized into voting for the pro-NATO pro-Zionist authoritarian Aznar, they threw him out. “Nationwide demonstrations and protests followed the attacks asking the government to tell the truth” (Wikipedia). The new government immediately withdrew from Iraq. Spaniards’ mistrust of their own government saved their country from war and tyranny.

Imagine if such a thing had happened in the USA after 9/11.

Another major “false flag fail” was the August 2013 chemical weapons attack on al-Ghouta, Syria. The attack, perpetrated by the Gladio B war party and its Saudi foot soldiers, was intended to be falsely blamed on Syrian President Assad. The motive: Make it appear that Assad had crossed Obama’s “red line,” and trigger a US bombing campaign against Syria.

The global alternative media immediately broadcast the truth: The al-Ghouta attack was obviously a false flag. Why would Assad blatantly cross Obama’s “red line” at the precise moment that a UN chemical inspections team was touching down at the airport a few miles away?

The resulting hoopla led to President Obama being informed that the case for Assad doing al-Ghouta was “not a slam dunk.” Translated from the official BS, that meant “it was a false flag, and we got caught.”

The British Parliament, skeptical about Assad’s purported responsibility for al-Ghouta, voted against authorizing military action. The US Congress, many of whose constituents read the alternative media, was wary. At the last minute, the proverbial 11th hour, Obama decided to refuse to play along with the perpetrators’ war agenda. A potential World War III was avoided … thanks to the “false flag truth movement.”

Along with such examples of false flags that failed to trigger the intended agenda are the presumably numerous cases of pre-emptively neutralized false flags. When perpetrators sit down to consider potential false flags, they carefully consider the likely public reaction; and as the public becomes more skeptical, the number of workable false flag plots decreases.

These examples show that an aware, alert public can spoil the best-laid plans of false flag perpetrators. Anyone planning to sabotage a potential Bernie Sanders presidency with one or more false flag incidents would use advanced techniques for monitoring public attitudes and awareness, and decide whether or not to go ahead with “Plan A, “Plan B,” “Plan C” and so on based on what sort of public reaction they were expecting.

If Bernie Sanders supporters, as a group, become sufficiently educated about false flags, and convey what they know to the larger public, they could dissuade the war party, and the banksters who own it, from blowing up Bernie’s chances by blowing up a skyscraper or public monument … or even nuking an American city.

For those who may wish to educate themselves about false flags, and help make a better world possible, here is a very brief list of key books; my apologies to the hundreds of authors whose important works didn’t make the cut.

813,"Tariffs, while they’re not a cure-all, serve an important dual function—to bring about an increase in tax revenue at the water’s edge … and to protect the economy from excessive imports and thereby spur an increase in domestic production. Pat Buchanan reminds us tariffs are “the taxes that made America great.”

What the big-box media calls a “trade war” between the U.S. and China is, in reality, hard-nosed but vitally necessary negotiations in which the Trump administration is showing some fortitude in pursuing long-overdue adjustments to begin reducing China’s notoriously lopsided, long-term trade surplus with the U.S. President Donald Trump’s key tool in this process is the application of tariffs against Chinese imports over the last few months—largely for the purpose of improving America’s industrial sector by spurring domestic production.

Tariffs, while they’re not a cure-all across the board, serve an important dual function—to bring about an increase in tax revenue at the water’s edge to help the U.S. balance its books and resist the urge to raise domestic taxes, and to protect the economy from excessive Chinese imports and thereby spur an increase in domestic production. This production boost would translate into more buying power to purchase the productive output amid a gradually reduced reliance on imports.

But this upside to tariffs gets lost in the reports issued by a mass media cartel that puts undermining Trump ahead of all else. Helping set the record straight, the non-partisan Coalition for a Prosperous America (CPA) announced May 9 that a Department of Commerce report showed “that the monthly U.S. goods deficit with China fell to just $20.7 billion in March. That’s the smallest monthly deficit with China since March 2014.”

“In the face of continuing pressure from multinational interests and the import lobby, President Trump has stayed the course on China tariffs,” CPA Chairman Dan DiMicco remarked. “To the president’s credit, the tariffs are working. America’s manufacturers and workers are now seeing gains as manufacturing employment rises and China’s hold on the U.S. market shrinks.”

Michael Stumo, CEO of the CPA, added: “This is exactly what we were hoping to see when the president applied tariffs [to aid] important industries that have been facing heavily subsidized competition from China’s state-owned enterprises. We expect the next round of tariffs to have a positive effect to improve the U.S. economy and address Beijing’s continuing economic aggression.”

CPA Chief Economist Jeff Ferry, having examined the new Commerce Department data, found that the improvement in America’s goods deficit with China “has come largely through a reduction in imports.” He added: “While U.S. exports to China were $10.4 billion in March [2019]—a figure $1.9 billion lower than in March 2018—total imports reached only $31.2 billion, a full $7 billion less than the March total for 2018,” which was the lowest monthly China import level in five years. Furthermore, while 2018 imports from China averaged $44.9 billion a month, so far in 2019 they’re averaging just $35 billion—and are falling each month, according to the CPA.

“The United States economy continued to thrive in April,” the White House announced, “with the unemployment rate dropping to 3.6%—the lowest unemployment rate since December 1969, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) household survey. April also marks the 14th consecutive month of the unemployment rate being at or below 4%. The U-6 unemployment rate, a broader measure of unemployment that includes those who are unemployed, marginally attached to the labor force, and working part-time . . . remained at 7.3% in April, matching the lowest U-6 rate since December 2000.”

While the White House concedes that recent job gains “were predominantly concentrated in professional and business services (76,000 new jobs), education and health services (62,000 new jobs), and leisure and hospitality (34,000 new jobs),” and while “the construction sector added 33,000 new jobs in April and has added 669,000 jobs since the 2016 election,” it’ll be interesting to see what happens when tariffs to limit Chinese imports and produce more goods domestically sink in and have time to adjust the economic dials.

Mark Anderson is AFP’s roving editor. Email him at [email protected].

Before globalism became the law of the land, tariffs protected and enriched the American people.

As his limo carried him to work at the White House Monday, Larry Kudlow could not have been pleased with the headline in The Washington Post: “Kudlow Contradicts Trump on Tariffs.” The story began: “National Economic Council Director Lawrence Kudlow acknowledged Sunday that American consumers end up paying for the administration’s tariffs on Chinese imports, contradicting President Trump’s repeated inaccurate claim that the Chinese foot the bill.”

A free-trade evangelical, Kudlow had conceded on “Fox News” that consumers pay the tariffs on products made abroad that they purchase here in the U.S. Yet that is by no means the whole story.

A tariff may be described as a sales or consumption tax the consumer pays, but tariffs are also a discretionary and an optional tax. If you choose not to purchase Chinese goods and instead buy comparable goods made in other nations or the USA, then you do not pay the tariff.

China loses the sale. This is why Beijing, which runs $350 billion to $400 billion in annual trade surpluses at our expense, is howling loudest. Should Donald Trump impose that 25% tariff on all $500 billion in Chinese exports to the U.S., it would cripple China’s economy. Factories seeking assured access to the U.S. market would flee in panic from the Middle Kingdom.

Tariffs were the taxes that made America great. They were the taxes relied upon by the first and greatest of our early statesmen, before the coming of the globalists Woodrow Wilson and FDR.

Tariffs, to protect manufacturers and jobs, were the Republican Party’s path to power and prosperity in the 19th and 20th centuries, before the rise of the Rockefeller Eastern liberal establishment and its embrace of the British-bred heresy of unfettered free trade. The Tariff Act of 1789 was enacted with the declared purpose, “the encouragement and protection of manufactures.” It was the second act passed by the first Congress led by Speaker James Madison. It was crafted by Alexander Hamilton and signed by President George Washington.

After the War of 1812, President Madison, backed by Henry Clay, John Calhoun, and ex- Presidents Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, enacted the Tariff of 1816 to price British textiles out of competition so that Americans would build the new factories and capture the booming U.S. market. It worked.

Tariffs financed Abraham Lincoln’s war. The Tariff of 1890 bears the name of Ohio Rep. and future President William McKinley, who said that a foreign manufacturer “has no right or claim to equality with our own. . . . He pays no taxes. He performs no civil duties.”

That is economic patriotism, putting America and Americans first.

The Fordney-McCumber Tariff gave Presidents Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge the revenue to offset the slashing of Wilson’s income taxes, igniting that most dynamic of decades— the Roarin ’20s.

That the Smoot-Hawley Tariff caused the Depression of the 1930s is a New Deal myth in which America’s schoolchildren have been indoctrinated for decades.

The Depression began with the crash of the stock market in 1929, nine months before Smoot- Hawley became law. The real villain: the Federal Reserve, which failed to replenish that third of the money supply that had been wiped out by thousands of bank failures. Milton Friedman taught us that.

A tariff is a tax, but its purpose is not just to raise revenue but to make a nation economically independent of others and to bring its citizens to rely upon each other rather than foreign entities. The principle involved in a tariff is the same as that used by U.S. colleges and universities that charge foreign students higher tuition than their American counterparts.

What patriot would consign the economic independence of his country to the “invisible hand” of Adam Smith in a system crafted by intellectuals whose allegiance is to an ideology, not a people? What great nation did free traders ever build?

Free trade is the policy of fading and failing powers, past their prime. In the half-century following passage of the Corn Laws, the British showed the folly of free trade.

They began the second half of the 19th century with an economy twice that of the U.S. and ended it with an economy half of ours, and equaled by a Germany, which had, under Bismarck, adopted what was known as the American system.

Of the nations that have risen to economic preeminence in recent centuries—the British before 1850, the United States between 1789 and 1914, post-war Japan, China in recent decades— how many did so through free trade? None. All practiced economic nationalism. The problem for President Donald Trump?

Once a nation is hooked on the cheap goods that are the narcotic free trade provides, it is rarely able to break free. The loss of its economic independence is followed by the loss of its political independence, the loss of its greatness, and, ultimately, the loss of its national identity.

Brexit was the strangled cry of a British people that had lost its independence and desperately wanted it back.

435,"A busy weekend for MMA saw promotions including Invicta, WSOF, Cage Warriors and many others staging events around the world. The UFC’s offering was a Fight Night event in Brisbane, Australia. The fight card itself was an intriguing one with the main event scheduled to be a five round fight between heavyweight contenders; Mark Hunt and Antonio “Bigfoot” Silva.

Bigfoot, the number 4 ranked heavyweight was favoured over Hunt, though Hunt was fighting in front of his home crowd. One aspect that most agreed on was that the fight was unlikely to last the full five rounds with both of the fighters possessing extremely heavy hands. Hunt and Bigfoot were both coming off of losses, though the losses were to Junior Dos Santos and Cain Velasquez (respectively), who just fought each other for the Heavyweight title.

Immediately following the sensational knockout of James Te Huna by a rejuvenated legend in Mauricio “Shogun” Rua, the atmosphere was electric. As the two giants entered the Octagon and Bruce Buffer made the announcements, nobody could have imagined what was about to take place.

Whilst I will summarise what happened, it truly has to be seen to be believed. It was a masterpiece.

Bigfoot came out strong using his leg kicks to drastic effect on Hunt’s calf. With a n eight inch reach advantage, Bigfoot used his muay thai to keep a healthy distance from the brute force of Hunt. Continually changing stances with his movement fast and fluid, the 6’4” 264 pound Bigfoot could have been mistaken for a middleweight as he took control.

Round 2 saw Hunt start to have success with his boxing. Hunt landed his infamous overhand right that we’ve seen knock out many a fighter in the past, but Bigfoot took it, seemingly undeterred. Bigfoot went back to his leg kicks and with 40 seconds left on the clock he looked to do some serious damage to Hunt’s leg. Maybe this would be the killer blow with Hunt now struggling to walk. It wasn’t.

In Round 3 after looking down and out, the juggernaut that is Mark Hunt came back with vengeance. He dropped Bigfoot with another right hand and spent over 2 minutes in a top position using expert ground and pound technique. The crowd sensed a stoppage but Bigfoot somehow survived and made it back to his corner, his face bloodied by Hunt’s onslaught.

As we entered the “championship rounds” of this non-title fight, it was now very apparent that something special was happening. Both fighters had been down and seriously hurt, yet here they both still stood, unwilling to give in. The 4th round began and it was on!

Despite early takedowns by Hunt, Bigfoot found his way back to his feet and the two met once more in the centre of the Octagon for a legendary hand to hand combat exchange. Bigfoot managed to come out on top and had Hunt backed up to the fence receiving a flurry of punches. Surely now the fight would be stopped. The fight went to the ground with Bigfoot on top and he produced his own ground and pound. Hunt was now bloodied too, but amazingly again, he managed to reach the end of the round.

In a show of brotherhood, sportsmanship and solidarity, these 2 warriors began the 5th and final round by embracing one another in the centre of the Octagon. It was a touching moment, familiar to those within the MMA community but rarely seen elsewhere between 2 athletes competing so fiercely against one another.

Both now bloodied, bruised, and exhausted, with the crowd on their feet, the 2 fighters again began exchanging blows. Bigfoot was missing; Hunt was landing. With the tide yet again turning it looked as if Hunt might have enough to finish Bigfoot with his famed right hand KO. A cut opened up above Bigfoot’s eye and the referee called in the doctor to check it. The doctor was happy; the fight continued. Bigfoot made it to the bell and the fight that was never meant to go the distance, had done just that. The 2 yet again embraced. The crowd roared showing their appreciation to the fighters.

When Bruce Buffer announced a majority draw, there were no complaints. On a night where 2 gladiators and masters of their craft gave the MMA world everything they had, and with both still standing when the final bell rang, the winners were the fans.

It was another fight to compete with Jones Vs Gustafsson and Sanchez Vs Melendez for UFC fight of the year, and it will be remembered for years to come. What a fight. What a night. The UFC have done it again.",mainstream
405,"The Loch Ness Monster, often referred to as Nessie, is a prehistoric water creature that is said to live in the waters of Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands. Nessie is described as having a long neck with multiple humps on its back. While the legend of the monster is considered anecdotal in nature, there are a few photos of what is said to be Nessie and a few sonar readings that have turned up minimal evidence (1). The legend of the Loch Ness Monster became popular in the 1900s and is still popular today. Many tourist travel to the Loch in scores to see if they might catch a sighting of the monster (1). The elusive Loch Ness Monster can be considered extraordinary due to the fact that the evidence on it being real is minimal, but many believe there might be something hiding in the depths of Loch Ness.

There is evidence on both sides of the belief. No real proof has been found to show that the Loch Ness Monster is real. Many doubters say that the reported sightings of the monster are obstructed objects or other sea life. Only a few pictures have been taken and none are clear enough to prove there to actually be a monster. Eye witness testimonies are the only so called proof that anyone has to say there is actually a monster in the Loch. The most infamous photo of the Loch Ness Monster came from a London-based doctor. It later turned out that, while the doctor’s status made the photo credible, it turns out that the picture was falsified (2).

While there are no true cognitive contributions to society that this belief can make, it does make for a fun anecdote. Those who do believe in Nessie might not be misinformed, they could just be misinterpreting what they are seeing. It could lie in their perception of what they are seeing. It is a large possibility that they are seeing something that isn’t Nessie at all. Their desire for there to be something unknown in the waters of Loch Ness could be driving their perception of what they are seeing.

There have been many reports of monsters and other large creatures throughout the lochs in Scotland, but Nessie is by far the most famous of the monsters. The high number of sighting reports could be the reason behind the belief. If anything, the wide popularity of the legend is the reason why people still believe it might be out there.

The prehistoric monster of Loch Ness is a popular extraordinary belief around the world. People from all over come to the Scottish Highlands in hopes of a chance sighting of Nessie. While there is no scientific evidence to prove that it actual exists, it is still a widely held belief that it is real.",mainstream

Increasing Concern about Chaotic Global Weather, Earthquakes and Meteor Explosions in Atmosphere

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Russian Subscribers

I have received information today from an American about a Western media report about the current events happening in the world titled “Is something wrong with Mother Earth?” that was broadcast over their national television news collective NBC. I am led to understand also that this media collective has the attention of the greater part of the American public who view television newscasts, so this is my reason for attempting to understand this work of fiction.

This report begins by saying, “Consider the recent evidence: 1.) The violent earthquake and the resulting tsunami that left parts of 11 nations devastated. 2.) November's powerful 6.2 earthquake in that killed eight people. 3.) Three volcanoes in all simultaneously active for the first time in 31 years.”

The report then asks the question, “Should we be worried?” to which the reply given by NASA scientist Dr. David Adamec says, ""The world is not coming to an end, and things are fine.”

“Adamec studies the Earth and says there is no scientific data to suggest all this violence from the Earth, at the same time, is unusual.” This report continues and then adds, ""The planet is alive and we have a hot core and every once in a while there are weak zones in the crust and we see things like volcanoes and earthquakes happen along those things. It's just a normal part of what a planet does.""

The report then asks, “But wait a minute — what about all the wicked weather?” To which a professor, Dr. Chuck Connor from the , replies, ""There's no causal relationship there at all, the current bad, bad weather we've been having is not influenced by volcanoes or earthquakes.""

Though it is hard for any of us here to believe, or even understand, this is the extent of the information about these current events that this television news collective reported on to the American people.

Could this news collective have included these events of the past few weeks too?

On December 4th in the New England Region of the United States where it is says, “the bright flash light up the clouds, three seconds later came the boom”

On December 6th over Australia where it was reported, “An eerie, constant, low rumbling sound accompanied the explosions.” From ‘fireballs’.

On December 12th the reports from the Washington D.C. Region of the that says, “It looked like a ball of fire falling out of the sky."".

On December 13th the report of the fireball that lit up the skies of China ‘turning night into day’.

On December 16th from the Utah Region of the where it was reported, “Meteor May Have Fallen in ”

On December 19th where in Indonesia a news report was headlined, “Meteor suspected amid unexplained sightings and blast in ”

On December 21st where an unknown asteroid, and since named 2004 YD5, was discovered flying past the earth and under our satellites.

On January 5th where in the Wisconsin Region of the United States a news report says, “Authorities in north central Wisconsin received dozens of reports Tuesday evening of bright flashes of light in the sky, as from an explosion, and they said it likely came from meteor activity.""

On January 7th where in the Alaskan Region of the a news report says, “ residents saw a fiery ball traversing the sky.”

On January 12th where in it is reported, “I saw a huge ball of fire in the air. It raced down to the earth so fast that before I could do anything.""

But, if they had presented these events for consideration they would have also had to have shown that these sightings contradict The American Meteor Society, and as they have stated, “Due to the combination of all of these factors, only a handful of witnessed meteorite falls occur each year.""

This report also failed to mention the Great Antarctica Earthquake that occurred on December 24th, was measured at a magnitude of 8.2,and which is one of only 12 of this magnitude that has occurred on earth since 1990, and one of the most powerful since 1900.

Of course the 9.0 earthquake event that occurred in the was mentioned, but because it was not connected with the Great Antarctica earthquake event the people would not look for any connections between them. And a connection there is between them, and also the Atlantic Ocean, in the that these events are occurring in those areas of the world having anomalous magnetic features, and as I had previously written about in my report of January 10th, ""Continuing Earth Changes Cripple American Submarine and Pose New Dangers for the American Continents"". (Even as I am writing these words I am hearing about a large earthquake event occurring in the Atlantic Ocean Region.)

The report continues with, “Three volcanoes in Guatemala all simultaneously active for the first time in 31 years,"" but does not mention at all the active reports of volcanic activity from their own governments scientific organization, the USGS, and which include: Andaman Islands, Veniaminof, USA, Colima, Mexico, Karymsky, Russia, Kilauea, USA, Manam, Papua New Guinea, Shiveluch, Russia, Soufriere Hills, Montserrat, Spurr, USA, St. Helens, USA, Suwanose-jima, Japan and Tunguraha, Ecuador. Neither was it mentioned that ’s Mt. Etna had also erupted, though the lava flow has stopped and now only gas is escaping.

Also not mentioned was the continued issues, some mysterious and still unexplained, involving the Yellowstone Region of the and where a new report is circulating that says, “The American people are not being told that the explosion of this 'super volcano' could happen at any moment.""

This report also mentioned the great rains and snows presently occurring in the western regions of the but failed to put this information within the context of the overall present conditions of the earth’s weather systems, such as:

November 14th, Record Cold in Boston, November 27th, Record snow is Israel, November 30th, Record Cold in California, December 1st, Record Cold in Nevada, December 1st, Record Heat in Australia, December 2nd, Rare Winter Typhoon Taiwan, December 2nd, Mysterious fog covers 86,800 square miles of China, December 3ed, Super Typhoon in Philippines, December 3ed, Record Heat in Canada, December 5th, Record Rain in California, December 12th, Worst Floods in 40 years in Malaysia, December 15th, 50 Foot Waves Hit Hawaii, December 16th, Record Cold in Florida, December 17th, Hurricane force winds hit California, December 17th, Hurricane Force Winds hit France, December 19th, Record Heat in Montana, December 19th, Mysterious Light Brightens Arctic, December 19th, Coldest in 50 years in Israel, December 19th, Hurricane Force Winds in England, December 19th, Hurricane Force Winds in Germany, December 21st, Fog Covers Northern India, December 21st, Hurricane Force Winds in Canada, December 21st, Hurricane Force Winds in Montana, December 23ed, Catastrophic Storms Hit South Africa, December 23ed , Hurricane Force Winds in Finland, December 23ed, Worst Strom in Ohio History, December 23ed , Big Storms Shatter Records in Kentucky, December 23ed , Massive Storms Hit Canada, December 23ed , Massive Storm Spans Sea of Japan, December 24th, Severe Storms Leave Most of Finland Without Power, December 24th, 2km Thick Fog Layer Covers Large Areas of India, December 24th, Massive Storms Leaves Thousands Stranded in Scotland, December 25th, South Florida Covered in Fog, December 25th, First White Christmas in 86 Years for Texas Town, December 26th, Millions wake up to White Christmas in England, December 28th, Alaska Rains 212% above Normal, December 28th, Heavy Rains and Floods Kill 20 in Iran, December 29th, Rare Winter Heat Wave in Midwest US Continues, December 30th, United Arab Emirates Has First Snow in Recorded History, January 3ed, Lighting Causes Brushfires in Australia, January 4th, Floods, Rain Devastate South Africa, January 4th, Storms Leave Thousands Without Power in Australia, January 4th, Coldest December in 59 Years for New Zealand, January 4th, Lightning Kills 8 in South Africa, January 4th, Lightning Kills 27 in India, January 5th, Extremely High Alaskan Temperatures, January 6th, Freeze and Record Lows Strand Thousands in US, January 8th, Mighty Cyclone Approaches Kamchatka, January 8th, Storms Pound Northern Europe, January 8th, Record High Temperatures in Russia, January 9th, Hurricane Force Winds in Denmark and Sweden, January 9th, Europe’s ‘Tsunami’, January 10th, Record Rains Continue in California, January 10th, Strongest Storm in 40 Years Hits Russia, January 11th, Record Heat, No Snow in Many Parts of Europe and January 12th, Winter storm leaves behind damage worth EUR millions in Finland.

This list should only be remarkable for what is not included, not what is. To include all the significant and record setting, weather events for just this time period alone, November 14th to January 12th, would take many hundreds of pages.

Also not noted here have been these past year’s worldwide record numbers of floods, tornados, hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons that have served to make this past years events the costliness in human history, as reported by the world’s largest insurance company Munich Re. Munich Re board member Stefan Heyd has also said that the weather extremes ""underline our long-standing demand for prompt and rigorous measures against global climate change. After the disappointing outcome of the recent climate summit in Buenos Aires, time is running out.""

Now of these things we of our people know, but to the Western people? They hear such things, and as I have quoted earlier, “Things are fine” and ""There's no causal relationship there at all, the current bad, bad weather we've been having is not influenced by volcanoes or earthquakes.""

But we can find in their own children’s studies the knowledge that “We have a closed atmospheric system which means all the water on our planet is finite and has been recycled for billions of years.”, as it states correctly on this website for primary children.

The knowledge of their University students is of course much greater, and includes this example about these facts, ""Volcano eruptions of a large magnitude can impact global climate, reducing the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth’s surface, lowering temperatures in the troposphere, and changing atmospheric circulation patterns"" (Wolfe, 1). Sulfuric gases convert to sulfate aerosols which may linger up to four years in the atmosphere. On June 15, 1991, Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines, causing extensive consequences in the environment. ""The direct radiative effect of volcanic aerosols causes general stratospheric heating and tropospheric cooling, with a tropospheric warming pattern in the winter"" (Wolfe, 1). This demonstrates that volcanic aerosols force fundamental climate mechanisms that play an important role in the global change process.”

We know too that this is in fact not what the American scientist exactly said, but was the intention of the wording of his comments, for the uneducated to draw an imaginary correlation between volcanic eruptions and ‘bad’ weather. Hence, ‘since the one isn’t occurring the other can’t be caused by it’.

This provides to you an excellent example of how the Western people have so separated themselves from the world that they have no knowledge left of how every thing is in fact connected to every other thing in life, and everything is life.

What are to us the simplest concepts of life, and living, as human beings are to them the hardest to understand because they have no knowledge of how to conceptualize the wholeness of all, and their part of the wholeness. Like a drop of water from the ocean on their finger tip they believe that is all they are. But inside of them also is the knowledge that their ‘drop’ of life will return to the ocean and therein lies their deepest fear, where is the drop when it returns to the ocean?

Even my writings to them, of which this is a part of, they fail to connect the knowledge of them all. They instead keep each of them as separate pieces without knowing that the greater knowledge of knowing is in the wholeness of all of them, not in any single one.

In many of the letters I receive from them there comes through in their words to me a form of absolute madness that you could only understand by knowing the effects of caging animals. Even in this report from their television collective, NBC, you can see how even in these days the bars of their mental and spiritual prison are continuing to be built around them.

But many also are those who are in the knowing of our messages and our meanings, and continue to warn others also, even to much ridicule and scorning. This is good and also how it must be, as we know.

160,"Are fashion trend-setters Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and John McCain (R-AZ) leading by example? Each one has been sporting a single, orthopedic “walking boot” for some time now.

First, on October 15 this year, Hillary Clinton injured her right foot during her United Kingdom book tour. After canceling or rescheduling interviews with British journalists, one Clinton spokesman excused her absence by saying she had twisted her ankle.

But when Mrs. Clinton appeared on BBC’s “Graham Norton Show” with her right foot in a foot brace, she joked that she had fallen and broken a toe after catching a high heel on some steps. Describing her accident, she said, “I was running down the stairs in heels with a cup of coffee in hand, I was talking over my shoulder, and my heel caught, and I fell backward. I tried to get up and it really hurt. ‘I’ve broken my toe.'”

This online health source confirms that this treatment befits a broken toe:

“The doctor may prescribe a walking boot. This will allow you to bear weight on your injured foot while protecting the toe so it can heal.”

The US National Library of Medicine chimes in with, “Each toe is made up of 2 or 3 small bones. These bones are small and fragile. They can break after you stub your toe or drop something heavy on it.”

So far, Hillary’s broken toe story bears up – on the surface. But just how long does it take a broken toe to heal? After all, Mrs. Clinton appeared in her walking boot in mid-October, two and a half months ago.

MedicineNet says it takes about six weeks for a broken toe to heal.

Yet, as of December 14, the failed 2016 presidential candidate was still wearing the walking boot in Vancouver, Canada during another global promotional book tour:

Coincidentally, CNN announced on November 6, 2017, that Sen. John McCain had been treated for an injured Achilles tendon, and “plans to wear a boot.” Does it seem odd that he would announce such detail in advance? The story also wove in an extra dose of sympathy by informing us that Sen. McCain’s brain cancer is “very, very serious.”

Happily, Sen. McCain’s medical conditions are not keeping him out of the public eye. The Washington Examiner published side-by-side photos of Sen. John McCain wearing his walking boot on different legs. Yes, really:

The Hill published McCain’s reasoning in his November 23 tweet:

“My left leg was doing extra work to compensate for the boot, so I’m giving it a break. I still hate wearing this boot, but it won’t slow us down from frying 7 turkeys today!”

Riiiight. Compensate away, sir, but you appear to be a big, fat turkey of a fibber. Do you really think anyone is that stupid, to believe such a ridiculous story?

Or perhaps these boots have a purpose beyond mere fashion? A theory is going around Conspiracy Street that Hillary Clinton and John McCain (and other high-ranking government officials) have already been indicted, arrested, and are now forced, by court order, to wear GPS ankle bracelets that track their movements, prevents them from traveling in restricted areas, and reports when they contact other indicted individuals – for example, Chelsea Clinton?

After all, various sources, including the Hal Turner radio show, are reporting that “4,289 sealed indictments have appeared just between October 30 and November 22, 2017. The normal limit is not more than 1000 sealed indictments for the entire year.”

In case you didn’t know, a sealed indictment is “an indictment kept from the public for a period of time until it is released. An indictment is a felony accusation issued by a grand jury against a suspect in a crime.”

More than four thousand defendants represent a significant amount of swamp drainage, regardless of the specific charges.

The nature of these alleged indictments is also the subject of much speculation, from Pizzagate perps to hijacking the 2016 Democratic National Convention before the presidential election.

Apparently, Mrs. Clinton just can’t get a break these days – except, of course, for one of her toes. Allegedly.",conspiracy
164,"n a stunning finding that set off shock waves of grieving through much of the world, University of Oxford researchers announced that the beloved bipedal cryptid known globally as Bigfoot is dead—or, more specifically, that he never existed.

Mr. Foot, who also went by the name Sasquatch, or in the original Halkomelem, was 4,000 years old. Or maybe not.

The Oxford finding was the result of a three-year study that began in 2012 when researchers issued an open call for hair samples held in museums and private collections that were said to come from “an anomalous primate,” which is the kind of term scientists from a place like Oxford University often use when they’re publishing a peer-reviewed paper on, you know, Bigfoot, and don’t want to be snickered at by other Oxford University scientists in the faculty lounge. Thirty-six samples from the U.S., Russia, Indonesia, India, Bhutan and Nepal were ultimately submitted, a geographical range that suggested a) there was more than one “anomalous primate” out there, b) there is only one, but he is really, really well-traveled, c) there’s a teensy-weensy chance the hairs came from something else.

To find out, the investigators conducted DNA analyses on the samples and compared their findings to those of known species of animals. As it turned out they got some hits—a lot of them actually. The samples, the investigators found, came from animals as diverse as bears, wolves, raccoons, porcupine, deer, sheep, at least one human, and a cow. Again, that’s a cow.

The news was met with something less than universal acceptance that the long-rumored 10-ft. tall, 500-lb. creature with a two-ft. footprint, a coat of reddish brown hair, the sagittal crest of a gorilla and an unpleasant smell just might not exist. “The fact that none of these samples turned out to be [Bigfoot] doesn’t mean the next one won’t,” said no less a person than Bryan Sykes, the Oxford researcher who led the study, according to the Associated Press.

The Guardian headlined its story on the announcement “DNA analysis indicates Bigfoot may be a big fake,” begging the question of what it might take to warrant a headline that Bigfoot a big fake.

None of that will do much to relieve the grief in the parts of Bigfoot-loving community that do, reluctantly, accept the Oxford team’s findings. As yet, Bigfoot intimates Kraken, Wendigo, Yeti and The Loch Ness Monster have issued no statement and have not returned calls or e-mails requesting comments. That could, scientific literalists suggest, indicate that they don’t exist either. But really, they’ve probably just gone into seclusion.",mainstream
1220,"So Mitt Romney put his big foot in his mouth again, as he has done so often recently. Last week it was Libya, this week Palestine, and along the way he insulted half the US electorate. His campaign now appears to be in freefall.

This time he stirred things up by saying that he was writing off 47 per cent of US voters who were ""victims"" and didn't pay taxes as they would never vote for him. He also made it clear he is against redistribution: the poor are on their own.

Well, actually he didn't exactly say it publicly, he said it behind closed doors at a fundraising dinner with a few well-heeled supporters at the residence of a wealthy donor, but was caught out because one of the waiters apparently filmed him on their iPhone.

Mr Romney had to backtrack a little when it was pointed out that this actually includes lots of Republican voters. Many Americans receive help from the federal government in the form of social security and Medicare (which they pay for through payroll taxes), veterans' benefits (which they often obtain through service in the military), college loans, food stamps or other support.

But Mr Romney hasn't backed down, despite being lambasted by critics including a number of well-known Republican supporters such as Peggy Noonan and Bill Kristol. Even Paul Ryan said he didn't agree with Mr Romney's comments. Dumb and dumber.

That brings me to George Osborne, who apparently has also written off a big chunk of the British electorate, who presumably will also never vote for the nasty party. Recall this is the guy who cut the top rate of tax for his rich pals, but introduced pasty and granny taxes. There have been all those cuts in frontline services, with so many more to come, big job cuts, and a pay freeze in the public sector. Now Slasher has a plan to squeeze the pips out of the poorest of the poor by freezing the increase in welfare benefits, by ending the automatic annual increase in benefits in line with inflation. That really is going to solve the country's fiscal problems at a stroke, I don't think. I don't know how he sleeps at night. Not a great idea to write off the poor and the disabled.

The fact that the Government is relying heavily on monetary policy to provide stimulus means it has essentially abandoned regional policy, especially given that it has abolished Regional Development Agencies. Plus a disproportionate chunk of public spending cuts are occurring north of the Watford gap. So I am rather surprised that there hasn't been more public outcry in places like the North-west, the North-east and Yorkshire and Humberside, where unemployment rates are 9.1 per cent, 10.4 per cent and 9.8 per cent respectively, compared with 6.3 per cent in the South-east. The North-east is the only region where inactivity rates are over 25 per cent. House price declines have also been greatest in these areas where there is little Tory representation.

So what exactly is the Government doing to help the poorer regions? As far as I can see, close to zippo. The tiny enterprise zones have only a minor impact. It's probably not a good idea to write off big chunks of the country.

On top of this, the Government has decided to take on workers' rights, including moves announced by Vince Cable to make it less costly to fire people. This is also ideological, as there is no evidence at all to suggest that labour market inflexibility in the UK is constraining growth; in fact, exactly the opposite is the case. David Davis and Liam Fox have absolutely no basis on the evidence to argue that de- regulating the labour market is a problem or that removing workers' rights would bring significant benefits. Wages have been flexible downwards, and firms have hired temporary workers and reduced hours at will. The Coalition made a big deal of the fact that the World Economic Forum in its Global Competitiveness Report 2012-2013 moved the UK up the world competitiveness rankings to 8th from 10th the year before. We were beaten by, in order, Switzerland, Singapore, Finland, Sweden, Netherlands, Germany, and the US. What the Coalition failed to mention was that the UK ranked 5th in labour market efficiency behind only Switzerland, Singapore, Hong Kong and Canada. Of interest is that the countries that Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne frequently compared us to when they imposed austerity rank somewhat lower: Greece is 133rd and Spain 108th. The Dominican Republic is ranked 107th. Not a great idea to write off the workers. No wonder there were rumblings of discontent at the TUC last week.

Then there was Sir John Major's claim of green shoots. Not according to the Bank of England's agents, whose report suggested no evidence of any improvement. They reported that the level of investment would be broadly unchanged over the coming 12 months. Export growth continues to slow, reflecting weakening conditions throughout the euro area. Manufacturing growth had slowed further, and was broadly flat on a year earlier. Construction output continued to fall, largely due to cuts in work for the public sector, along with some weather-related disruption.

The cost of borrowing was creeping up as lenders passed on higher funding costs, although many banks were preparing to make use of the Funding for Lending Scheme. Employment intentions indicated little job creation in the private sector over the coming six months. Consistent with that, the minutes of the MPC's September meeting suggested signs of ""some modest underlying expansion. Set against that, the more forward-looking components of the business surveys were weaker, and the rise in energy prices would mean that the squeeze on real household incomes would not ease further in the short term"". So little sign of green shoots any place. Borrowing in August hit a record £14.4bn, pushing Slasher's ex-growth strategy to cut the deficit even further on to the rocks.

The next round of spending cuts is about to come. Who is watching out for the meek and the mild? Certainly not the Coalition here, or Mitt over the pond.",mainstream
212,"Russia intends to spend more than $200 million (or 162 million euros) to make sure stadiums built for the World Cup do not go to waste after the showpiece ends.

The hosts are trying to use the football final to revive fan interest in the struggling domestic leagues.

Each of the 11 host cities is either getting a brand new arena or having an existing one refurbished from the ground up.

The idea is to replace cavernous all-purpose stadiums in which supporters are exposed to the sun and snow with modern ones outfitted with the latest amenities.

Vladimir Putin issued an order last October requiring his government to draft a World Cup ""legacy"" programme that raises club-match attendance and boosts youth player development.

But the question long facing Russia has been how to reap rewards from the massive investment in cities where local clubs play second-tier football.

The cabinet's proposal reported by state media on Tuesday admits that the government will have to foot the bill in some places until 2023.

""Keeping in mind the high cost of stadium operations and the low expected football club revenues, it is impossible to expect stadium use to be commercially viable in the next 3-5 years,"" the government programme says.

The RIA Novosti state news agency said the government wants to assign 16.6 billion rubles ($265 million) to the legacy programme.

Most of that money -- $190 million -- will come from the federal budget and be assigned to keeping stadiums open in seven of the smaller host cities.

Some of the money will also be spent on training facilities and youth football centres.

Russia admits that it will not turn a profit as host.

But it views the international football extravaganza as a chance to make a long-term investment in a game that has struggled since Soviet times.

It also dearly wants to avoid getting stuck with white elephants, stadiums built for major events that turn into abandoned symbols of mismanagement and excess.

The problem has most recently attracted attention after the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Brazil.",mainstream
1168,"Detox foot pads were first used in Japan. It is about stick-on pads that need to be placed on the soles of the feet before going to bed.

The next day when you remove the footpads, you will see that the dangerous toxins eliminated from the body have darkened the pads.

The foot pads are worn on feet because they help circulate blood and lymph into the torso. Our inactive lifestyle causes circulation to bog down around the ankles, lower legs and feet.

The positive results of using foot detox pads are less fatigue, joint pain, and fewer headaches.

Additionally, you can buy ready-made detox foot pads, or make your own at home.

These are the ingredients you will need:

Slice the garlic and onion till it is well chopped. Put it aside. Pour water in a kettle and let it boil. Add the finely sliced garlic and onions in the boiling water. Then, let it boil for additional 10 minutes.

Next, let the water cool off for 20 minutes. Then, pour the mixture in the center of the self-stick gauze pads, only enough to get wet. If there is too much liquid in the pads, squeeze the excess out. Also, try not to wet the sticky part of the pads.

Patch the self-stick gauze pad on the soles of the feet, especially at the center part. Put on socks so the pad won’t fall off. Throw it the next morning.",conspiracy
165,"The data used in this current investigation were derived from an experimental trial designed to evaluate the onset of infectiousness in relation to the appearance of clinical disease in FMDV-infected pigs (Fig. 2). A detailed description of the experimental study and clinical findings has been published previously9. Animal experiments were carried out within BSL3-Ag facilities at Plum Island Animal Disease Center, New York. All procedures were carried out in accordance with guidelines specified within the associated experimental protocol (protocol 231-11-R), and were approved by the Plum Island Animal Disease Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

In brief, the study included 8 groups of 5 pigs of approximately 8–10 weeks of age (~25 kg), of which one group was infected with FMDV A Cruzeiro through simulated-natural inoculation30. The remaining 7 groups of pigs (contact groups 1–7) were sequentially exposed to the infected donor pigs through 8 hours of successive co-habitation within a designated isolation room (Fig. 2). After exposure to the donor pigs, contact-exposed pigs were moved into separate isolation rooms and were monitored for development of FMD. Samples collected were oropharyngeal swabs to assess virus shedding and blood samples to measure viremia. Clinical examinations and sample collection were done at 8–24 hour intervals after exposure. The choice to use FMDV A24 Cruzeiro for these experiments was based upon numerous previous experiments in our laboratory which had demonstrated that this strain was consistently virulent and transmissible in pigs9,30,31,32.

The end of latency for the donor pigs was defined as the beginning of the 8 hour contact exposure period during which the first successful transmission event occurred. It was not possible to attribute transmission events to specific individuals as donors and contact pigs were allowed to move freely within the exposure room. Thus, the earliest observed transmission event was used to define the transition from latent to infectious periods for all 5 donor pigs. The end of the incubation period for the donor pigs was determined for each pig individually by the first detection of vesicular lesions, which for all donor pigs coincided with detection of fever (rectal temperature ≥40 °C). FMDV shedding was defined by continuous detection of FMDV RNA in OPF. Viremia was defined by detection of FMDV RNA in serum.

A Bayesian model was fitted to the data for the purpose of estimating the length of three distinct periods the donor pigs were expected to traverse: the latent, incubation, and infectious periods. A modeling approach was adapted from that published by Charleston et al.12. This model describes the relationship among the observed transmission successes and the unobserved latent, incubation, and infectious periods as well as the hyperparameters describing the distribution of those periods in the following way:

δ : indicator for successful transmission in challenge i of donor j.

p : probability of successful transmission in challenge i of donor j.

T : time during challenge i for which donor j is infectious.

μ , μ , μ , σ , σ , σ , ρ : hyperparameters for latent, incubation, and infectious period prior distributions (in order; the means for the three periods, the standard deviations for the three periods, and the correlation between the latent and incubation periods).

α , η , α , η , α , η : hyperparameters for the means and standard deviations for the latent, incubation, and infectious period prior distributions (in order, the mean and standard deviation for the mean of the prior latent distribution, the mean and standard deviation for the mean of the prior incubation distribution, the mean and standard deviation for the mean of the prior infectious distribution).

The likelihood above describes the relationship between the observed transmission event data with the unobserved latent, incubation, and infectious periods, while the prior information (Table 3) was based on accumulated data from previous investigations carried out under similar conditions30,31,32,33, or were left diffuse in the absence of such information. These sources of information were combined and the posterior distribution over the parameters (latent, incubation, and infectious periods along with the means of the three periods) given the observed data (the outcomes of the transmission events) was estimated. This distribution is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the joint prior distribution for all of the parameters.

As the posterior conditional distributions for at least the latent period, infectious period, and the transmission rate were intractable, a numerical rather than an analytic approach was pursued. The model was coded using Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS) software designed to perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations34. This version of the model required two sacrifices: the latent and incubation periods could not be jointly lognormal, and the prior hyperparameter variance terms (σ , σ and σ ) were held fixed due to MCMC chain convergence issues as a result of unidentifiability issues. The result of the former being that the latent and incubation periods are assumed independent a priori.

The proportion of infection that occurs prior to onset of clinical disease, denoted as θ, is a function of the quantities estimated by the model described above. Using the JAGS version of the model adapted from Charleston et al.12 and assuming that latent and incubation periods are independent a priori, θ is described in as follows:

In addition to θ, we propose herein a distinct parameter (ω; omega) that allows more precise and direct inference about pre-clinical infectiousness to be made regardless of the total duration of the infectious period by representing the disparity between incubation and latency (Fig. 1).

Estimating fluctuations of θ due to variations in duration of infectious period

As total duration of infectiousness was not experimentally evaluated in the current study, information about the length of the infectious period is drawn almost solely from the prior information. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of θ to variations in the total infectious period, θ was estimated as described above, but using incrementally increased integer values of infectious duration ranging from 1 to 14 days.

Modeling infection dynamics using different proxy measures to determine the onset of infectiousness

Four different proxy measures (Table 2) were evaluated for their ability to predict disease transmission. The outcome of modeling transmission using the defined proxy measures was compared to the standard model, which was based on confirmed transmission of FMDV to contact-exposed pigs (Confirmed Transmission Event (CTE) - Standard). The four evaluated proxies were defined as follows: (a) detection of FMDV RNA in serum, (b) detection of any FMDV RNA in OPF, (c) detection of FMDV RNA in OPF above a threshold of 6.5 log GCN/ml, which had previously been associated with successful transmission of FMDV9 (d) clinical signs of FMD. The data were input into a Bayesian model via five distinct indicator matrices, one for each measure of transmission, in which the number of rows equaled the number of contact animals-hours-post-inoculation combinations and the number of columns represented the five donor pigs. Each entry in the matrices was either a 1, if the donor animal met the criteria for successful transmission for the given transmission metric (Table 2) during exposure to the contact animal represented by that row, or a 0 if the donor animal did not meet the criteria for successful transmission given transmission metric at that time. For the CTE-standard transmission metric, which was defined by confirmed transmission to contact-exposed pigs, the vector for all donors was identical as the effect of individual donors on contact animal could not be determined as both sets of animals were exposed to one another in groups.

Simulation modeling of an FMD outbreak using estimated transmission parameters

The objective of the FMD outbreak simulations described herein was to evaluate the effect of altering the duration of the subclinical infectious period (omega; ω) on spread and duration of an outbreak of FMD in a US pig production sector. Estimates of disease stage durations were derived from modeling of animal-level infection dynamics (Table 1). The originally modeled output consisted of estimates for the durations of latent (E), incubation (C) and infectious (I) periods. The durations of the subclinical infectious period (ω = C − E) and clinical infectious period (I = I − C) were derived from these outputs. In addition to the baseline scenario (ω = 1 day), five omega values (0 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, and 5 days) were subjectively selected to evaluate the effect on altering the duration of the subclinical infectious period on the spread and duration of simulated outbreaks. While choosing different omega values, the durations of latent and clinical infectious periods were kept constant (similar to baseline scenario) except for the scenario in which ω = 0 day of omega where the latent duration was set to 2 days (Supplementary Table S4). The Within-herd (WH) software version 0.9.7 available through the North American Animal Disease Spread Model35 was used to estimate herd-level parameters based on the modeled animal-level FMD disease stage durations. A spatial microsimulation model called the Farm Location and Agricultural Production Simulator (FLAPS) was used to generate a synthetic population file of 45,509 farms with 54,628,373 total pigs36 representative of pig production systems in the eastern United States (Supplementary Fig. S2). The US pig farms (with essential attributes for ISP such as identification number, herd size, type of farms, and Cartesian coordinates) located in the Great Lake, North East and South East regions were included in the model scenarios. About 72% (N = 45, 509) of the total pig farms in the United States are located in these regions. Amongst these farms, 31% were commercial farms with a median herd size of 2725 pigs (range: 100 to 60, 595) and 69% were small-scale enterprises with a median herd size of 6 pigs (range: 1 to 99). Farm-type specific movement parameters and contact rates were assigned to reflect differences in movements between commercial and small-scale enterprises. FMD outbreak simulations were performed using InterSpread Plus (ISP) version 6.0 model software22. The ISP is a state-transition, stochastic and spatial modeling tool for the simulation of FMD and other similar diseases37. Twelve FMD outbreak scenarios were developed in ISP representing optimal and suboptimal outbreak response conditions for each of 6 distinct values for the duration of subclinical infectiousness: 0 day, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, and 5 days of omega, respectively (Supplementary Table S4).

The unit of interest in the model was the individual farms. FMD epidemics were initiated from single farms. After exposure to FMDV, the susceptible farms were modeled to transit into latent, subclinically infectious, clinically infectious, and depopulated states. The spread of FMDV from an infected to susceptible farms was modeled to occur through direct contact, indirect contact, and local spread (Supplementary Note). The daily probability of transmission of FMD virus from infected farms to susceptible farm was calculated as the hypergeometric probability of shipping at least one infected animal off of an infected farm given the average herd size, shipment size, and the number of infected animals in a herd on a given day (Supplementary Fig. S3, Supplementary Note). Once an infected farm was detected, several control strategies were imposed simultaneously as is typically performed in response to outbreaks in FMD-free areas. Control strategies included zoning of control areas, tracing of animal movements, animal movement restrictions, depopulation of the infected farms, and surveillances as delineated in the national response plan for FMD24 (Supplementary Note). For each of the omega scenarios, two overall control strategies (optimal and suboptimal) were separately simulated. In the optimal control strategy, the detection of infected farms through passive surveillance was modeled to occur just after onset of clinical signs, which was further delayed by 14 days in suboptimal control category. Additionally, the delay in depopulation of detected farms was 3 (small farms) to 5 days (big farms) in the optimal control category, which was delayed by 7 more days to represent the suboptimal control. The major outputs parameters were outbreak size (number of infected farms and pigs), epidemic duration (days from onset of infection to end of epidemic), time between onset of infection to detection, and daily new infected farms due to each of the incorporated omega values. The median and interquartile range of outbreak size and epidemic duration were reported. The data analyses were performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., NC, USA, 2017) and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Excel, Redmond, Washington, 2017). The Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni corrections was performed for multiple group comparisons for the outcomes from various omega values. A p-value of ≤0.05% was considered for statistical significance.",mainstream
892,"Biden Sent Operatives to Rifle Through Senate Files - Now He Refuses to Release Them

Joe Biden reportedly sent operatives from his presidential campaign to rifle through the secret Senate files that may potentially contain information about former staffer Tara Reade's sexual assault allegation against him.

On Friday morning, the presumptive Democratic nominee finally broke his silence on Reade's rape accusation by denying the claims during an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""

""No, it is not true,"" Biden told host Mika Brzezinski.

""I'm saying unequivocally it never, never happened and it didn't. It never happened,"" the former vice president insisted.

""While the details of these allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault are complicated, two things are not complicated,"" he added.

""One is that women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced. The second is that their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny.""

""Responsible news organizations should examine and evaluate the full and growing record of inconsistencies in her story, which has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways,"" Biden added in regard to Reade's allegations.

Despite his denials, Biden refused to release the Senate documents, which are not public, claiming they don't contain ""personnel files.""

""The material in the University of Delaware has no personnel files ... but it does have a lot of confidential conversations,"" with other officials, like the president, Biden said.

During an excruciatingly awkward moment, Biden was asked by Brzezinski why he doesn't allow a search of his senatorial papers at the University of Delaware, limited to only those records that contain Tara Reade's name.

Seemingly caught off guard, after a long and uncomfortable silence, Biden replied saying, ""Who does that search?""

Reade, who worked for Biden's Senate office in the 1990s, claims that the then-Delaware senator assaulted her in 1993 by throwing her up against a wall and forcibly penetrating her with his fingers after she had been sent to take his gym bag to him.

She says she was left ""devastated"" by the alleged assault and filed an official complaint with Biden's office regarding the incident.

Reade insists that a copy of the incident report must still exist in the archives.

According to a Business Insider report, in the spring of 2019, just after he launched his presidential bid, Biden campaign operatives were sent to look through the files, which are housed at the University of Delaware.

The university made clear, however, that no one has accessed the files since mid-March of this year when the school closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The archived files, which are sealed to the public, span Biden's 36-year Senate career, and have been kept under lock-and-key by the university since 2012.

The university previously said it planned to make the files publicly available two years after Biden's last day in public office, which would have been Jan. 20, 2019.

After Biden decided to run for president, however, the timetable was revised until two years after Biden ""retires from public life"" or two years after Dec. 31, 2019, whichever comes later.

So far, the university has stood by its refusal to make the files public, despite mounting pressure for them to unseal the documents.

Reade suspects that the archive may contain corroborating evidence for her claims, such as a sexual harassment complaint she allegedly filed with the Senate in 1993.

Reade told Business Insider that Ted Kaufman, Biden's chief of staff at the time, took notes during a meeting she had with him about Biden's alleged harassment.

Kaufman claims the meeting never occurred, however.

""He's now denying that we ever had the meeting, and I watched him take notes,"" she argued.

""Those notes would be in my personnel file, along with sick days or any kind of extra notes that I turn in.""

Reade has previously called on the university to release some or all of the documents, which she says could contain a host of other evidence, as well.

""I believe [the archive] will have my complaint form, as well as my separation letter and other documents,"" Reade told Fox News earlier this week.

""Maybe if other staffers that have tried to file complaints would come to light — why are they under seal?

""And why won't they be released to the public?""

It doesn't help that several University of Delaware board members have close personal and financial ties with the former vice president.

Many, including the Washington Post editorial board, are calling on Biden to push for the records' release.

""Insisting on an inventory doesn’t mean one believes Ms. Reade or doesn’t believe her,"" The Post's editorial read.

""It signals only a desire for the public to know all that’s able to be known, which ought to be in everyone’s interest.""

Biden on Friday claimed that any relevant records, however, would not be held at the university, but would be in the custody of the Archives.

Conveniently, Biden called for the secretary of the Senate to ask the National Archives to ""identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document.""

""If there was ever any such complaint, the record will be there,"" he said.

Biden also said the Archives are the relevant entity, and not the University of Delaware, which has many of his Senate papers but does not have ""personnel files.""

Tara Reade says she is now ready to ""testify under oath"" regarding her rape allegations against the Democratic 2020 presidential candidate.",conspiracy

 With talk that Greek banks have hit their emergency lending limit with the ECB (which has prompted a teleconference this morning among ECB polcy-makers), it seems the newly-found position of negotiating strength for Greece (perhaps encouraged by China or Russia behind the scenes) has prompted more demands:
• ecb could buy all euro zone debt maturing in 2016-2020 and all interest payments-syriza’s milios
• ecb would foot the bill now, but by 2040 it would be able to erase all losses through profit retention-milios

Roughly translated – “Get back to work, Mr.Draghi” and monetize all of Europe’s debt. With negative net issuance (i.e. central banks already monetizing over 100% of 2015’s expected issuance) already here, this demand merely pushes the ‘independent’ monetary policymakers to enable more fiscal profligacy.

 As EU politicians failed to reach a Greek debt deal in Brussels, thousands of people poured onto the streets of Athens and other large cities to protest austerity and voice support for the recently elected Syriza party.

 Eurozone finance ministers have made progress in discussions with Greece following hours of talks on Wednesday. The talks on whether to extend an international bailout to Athens will continue during the next scheduled meeting on Monday, as the sides could not agree on another meeting before then.

 “We explored a number of issues, one of which was the current program,” Eurogroup chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem said. “We discussed the possibility of an extension. For some that is clear that is preferred option but we haven’t come to that conclusion as yet.”

 

 Greece has confirmed there was no agreement, adding that “negotiations will continue with the goal of a mutually beneficial agreement.”

 “An extension of the memorandum cannot be accepted,” a statement from Athens reads. Greece’s new finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, is negotiating to adjust conditions of the $284 billion bailout memorandum, agreed by a previous government in 2012.

According to his recent statements, Varoufakis is looking to scrap about 30 percent of the conditions, which came attached with the previous loans. He is also seeking to secure an extension for further talks, funded by a loan that will allow the government to fulfill its obligations.

After seven hours of talks, Varoufakis said it was a “good discussion” that will continue on Monday, adding he believes a “healing deal” on Greece’s finances could be reached next week.

 ‘Bankrupt but Free’ 

 Standing in front of the parliament building in central Athens – the traditional place for public demonstrations – a peaceful crowd held placards with the slogans “Bankrupt but Free” and “Stop Austerity, Support Greece, Change Europe.”

 “In the cities of Greece and Europe the people are fighting the negotiation battle, They are our strength,” leftist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras tweeted along with a picture of the rally in Athens, which attracted at least 15,000.

 Other large rallies took place in Kalamata, Thessaloniki, and Crete, with smaller solidarity demonstrations occurring in major European capitals.

A recent poll said that 75 percent of all Greeks support the actions of Syriza since it assumed power as the dominant part of the coalition, following early elections on January 25.

 Most EU officials were skeptical about agreeing to any deal on Wednesday, with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble saying the talks would give a chance to demarcate “red lines.”

227,"After a yearlong quest, a British geneticist says he has matched the DNA from hairs attributed to Himalayan Yetis, also known as ""Abominable Snowmen,"" to a breed of Arctic bear that lived tens of thousands of years ago. Other researchers say that might be as good an explanation as any.

The claim is being made by Oxford University's Bryan Sykes, already well-known for his research on human ancestry. Sykes says his findings suggest that sightings of the legendary Yeti may actually represent observations of a previously unknown creature in the Himalayas — perhaps a hybrid of polar bears and brown bears.

Sykes told NBC News that his aim is to bring the Yeti out of the realm of myth and fantasy. ""All my colleagues think I'm taking a risk in doing this, but I'm curious, and I am in a position to actually do something to answer the questions,"" he said.

Outside experts didn't reject Sykes' conclusion out of hand. Tom Gilbert, professor of paleogenomics at the Natural History Museum of Denmark, told The Associated Press that Sykes' research provided a ""reasonable explanation"" for past Yeti sightings.

Every remote area seems to have its tales of mysterious, seldom-seen, apelike beasts, ranging from the Yeti to the Bigfoot and Sasquatch of America's wildernesses. Last year, Sykes put out a call for samples of hairs or tissue linked to such creatures, with the aim of putting them through DNA tests.

Among those samples were hairs attributed to a Yeti mummy in the northern Indian region of Ladakh, purportedly taken by a French mountaineer who was shown the corpse 40 years ago; and a single hair that was found a decade ago in Bhutan, 800 miles (1,285 kilometers) to the east.



Sykes said the DNA from those two samples matched the genetic signature of a polar bear jawbone that was found in the Norwegian Arctic and is thought to be at least 40,000 years old. His findings have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, but they will be the focus of ""Bigfoot Files,"" a documentary series premiering Sunday on Britain's Channel 4.

Although the geneticist received other samples, he hasn't yet revealed any other DNA testing results. Sykes discussed the ""Bigfoot Files"" part of the project on Thursday during an interview with NBC News in London:

NBC News: How did you get these hairs?

Bryan Sykes: ""I put out a call for Yeti, Bigfoot, and Sasquatch hairs in 2012, and I received a good response from all over the world. Of the two samples in this study, one came from a Yeti mummy in Ladakh. It was from the mummified body that was shot 40 years ago by a local hunter. He kept it because he did not think it was a bear from its behavior. To him it was a Yeti. The other sample was a single hair from the other end of the Himalayas, from the Kingdom of Bhutan. It was found by the king’s own personal Yeti guards.""

So people there think Yetis exist?

""Everyone in the Himalayas has no doubt that they exist.""

Why have there not been more sightings, especially with the increase in technology?

""It’s a very frequent question. The answer is that they are very rare. The distances over which they roam are enormous and often heavily wooded, so they cannot be seen by satellite. And certainly in the Pacific Northwest, in the case of Sasquatch, they are thought to be shy.""

Have the findings been published in any papers or peer-reviewed?

""One of the reasons I started this project is that Bigfoot, Yetis and Sasquatches have fallen out of the scope of science, and all of the work that’s been done has been in the realm of fantasy and very eccentric, and not worked on very vigorously. Nothing has ever been published in a reviewed scientific journal. The project is still going on, and the idea is to publish this results in a scientific journal to bring it back into the realm of science. All my colleagues think I’m taking a risk in doing this, but I’m curious, and I am in a position to actually do something to answer the questions.""

What are the chances that these findings are wrong? Aren’t you just going on the word of the people who claim to have found the hairs?

""One of the reasons I felt confident enough to go into this madcap area is I do not have to form an opinion. I have got the hairs and I have tested the hairs. I cannot vouch for their authenticity, but there were witnesses, and the DNA cannot be made up or rigged. Those results are absolutely firm.""

839,"About 150 million years ago, a giant, long-necked dinosaur stomped on the ground in the midwestern US state of Wyoming and left behind what researchers said Tuesday is the largest dinosaur foot ever discovered.

The foot bones, found beneath a series of tail bones, extend about three feet (one meter) wide and are believed to belong to a brachiosaur, from a group of extinct herbivores known as sauropods, said the findings in the journal PeerJ.

This is an ""exceptionally large foot, bigger than the elements of all other known sauropod foot bones,"" lead author Anthony Maltese, of the Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center in Woodland Park, Colorado, told AFP in an email.

""I get asked often what's the biggest/longest/whatever superlative dinosaur that ever existed, and in this case I can actually provide an answer now,"" he said.

To give a sense of the creature's immense size, its thigh bone alone measured nearly 6.8 feet (2.07 meters).

That said, the Wyoming brachiosaur is not the largest dinosaur known to man, since other excavations have turned up fossils from animals that were likely larger, but it is the biggest foot in evidence.

""There are tracks and other incomplete skeletons from Australia and Argentina that seem to be from even bigger animals, but those gigantic skeletons were found without the feet,"" said co-author Emanuel Tschopp, a postdoctoral fellow in the American Museum of Natural History's Division of Paleontology.

""This beast was clearly one of the biggest that ever walked in North America.""

The discovery also extends the known northern range of brachiosaurs, showing they roamed a vast area from Utah to Wyoming, added Maltese.

""Brachiosaurs are pretty rare as far as dinosaurs go, and being able to really expand their geographical range by hundreds of kilometers is exciting and may well help us understand them much better,"" he said.

Maltese and colleagues at the University of Kansas first came upon the foot, nicknamed ""Bigfoot"", in 1998, when he was an undergraduate student.

Then life, and work, got in the way.

""It became very difficult to find time to keep up on the literature in order to finish the project,"" he told AFP.

""Luckily by procrastination, it enabled me the opportunity to assemble an absolutely killer international research team and have the ability to 3D-scan all of the bones for the best data of any large dinosaur foot to date.""",mainstream
218,"A team of academic and industry researchers led by Jennifer Doudna, the researcher best known for her role in the discovery of the gene editing technology called CRISPR, has turned a 2,500-square-foot scientific laboratory into a facility for running medical tests to detect the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.

The laboratory, which plans to serve hospitals in the San Francisco Bay Area, says it will be able to process more than 1,000 patient samples a day with a 24-hour turnaround, Doudna announced Monday. The lab will ramp up to processing 3,000 samples a day if necessary.

“This is a big, big issue here in the U.S.,” said Doudna. “We need to ramp up testing very fast. It’s been problematic for various reasons. And so we are building and implementing a clinical testing laboratory on the UC Berkeley campus to do exactly that.”

The effort is one more sign of the desperation in major metropolitan areas to ramp up testing for the coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2. Two weeks ago, the U.S. had only processed 42,000 tests over the course of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Covid Tracking Project, a volunteer effort. As of this week, the total number of test results returned has risen to nearly 900,000.

Doudna’s effort isn’t the first in academia. The Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass., began processing test results last week, and said it would be able to process 2,000 tests a day with a 12-hour turnaround.

The new lab is housed at the University of California, Berkeley’s Innovative Genomics Institute, where Doudna is the executive director. It is being run by more than 50 volunteers from Berkeley and its environs, including the chief scientific officer of lab equipment giant Thermo Fisher, team members from Salesforce, the head of commercial at laboratory information analysis firm Third Wave Analytics, and workers from Hamilton Corp., a maker of laboratory robots, two of which are used in the laboratory.

“It’s unbelievable to see how fast this is coming together and people writing software just overnight to put such a complicated pipeline in place and ensure that it’s secure,” Doudna said. “It’s really quite amazing.”

Doudna said that the Food and Drug Administration and the state of California had been willing to relax normal rules to get the effort going. The lab aims to have certification under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (or CLIA) program, the federal regulator of diagnostic labs, by next week, at which point it will begin testing samples. At first, the laboratory will test 300 samples at once, at first working with UC Berkeley’s medical center.

The effort to develop a test began on March 13. The Genomics Institute had been planning to use the space for experiments involving CRISPR, but it already met the safety specifications a laboratory would need in order to handle a contagious virus like SARS-CoV-2. The test is based on the Covid-19 test developed by ThermoFisher, which has received emergency clearance from regulators. and uses a process to conduct the polymerase chain reaction, the basis for all the widely used tests to detect the virus. But the researchers designed a way to use the test on two Hamilton laboratory robots that allowed them to automate the process.

“The throughput numbers assume only one thing: that Thermo supplies and kits do not run out,” said Fyodor Urnov, the genomics institute’s scientific director. He said that the group has already paid a hefty sum for 10,000 of the kits.

Doudna said that her group did a survey of local laboratories, and said that a number of them were running the testing reactions manually.



“Think about that,” she said. “They have no robotics at all. And their turnaround times as a result are up to seven days.”

There is no way, she said, that a manual approach could meet current capacity needs. (Many larger labs are using ready-made systems, such as those made by Roche, Hologic, or ThermoFisher, that are automated.)



“We’ve never faced this before, where clinical labs needed to very quickly be able to ramp up a test so fast,” Doudna said.",mainstream
1287,"I love Amazon.com. It offers the most pleasant online shopping experience in the world, and its rating and recommendation systems are remarkably good at predicting what you might like. But as the world’s largest e-commerce company, Amazon.com also has a lot of power over consumers, and last week that translated into a truly Orweillian stunt by Amazon that deleted copies of the e-book 1984 from Kindle devices everywhere.

When I first read the news, I couldn’t believe that books you buy on Kindle could be remotely deleted by Amazon.com — without notice and without your permission. That this actually took place (with the Big Brother book 1984, no less) brings up some very scary realizations about Amazon.com’s Kindle book reader:
• You apparently don’t really own the books you buy through Kindle. You’re just granted a temporary rental at the pleasure of Amazon.com, which may rescind that “right” at any time, without notice.
• If Amazon.com can delete one book off your Kindle (without your knowledge), it could delete them all. What happens when the U.S. government begins banning books (you know, books about freedom, or the U.S. Constitution, or how to make a backyard mortar out of PVC)? Will Amazon.com initiate a global delete process to remove any “illegal” books from your Kindle?
• If Amazon.com can delete books from your Kindle, it also stands to reason that it could modify books on your Kindle without your knowledge! Can you say, “Revisionist history?” One day all the books seem somehow… simplified…
• History is full of Police State governments that banned books and burned books in an attempt to limit the People’s access to knowledge. Is Amazon.com now engaged in digital book burning?
• It’s not just Amazon.com that’s acting out the themes of a police state dictatorship: Don’t forget that Google, Yahoo and other technology companies have openly cooperated with China’s censorship schemes that have continued an inhumane state of political oppression in that country.
• The advantage of owning a real book (printed on trees) is that no one can take it from you without getting past your front door and your German Shepherd. Plus, the screens don’t crack and the batteries don’t run out. You can set a book down when you need a pause, and when you pick it up you’ll find the page right where you left it. Amazing…

Just say no to DRM

The Amazon.com Kindle device is, by definition, a DRM device (Digital Rights Management). DRM is a term describing technologies that limit the ability of consumers to exercise control over content they’ve paid for. Record companies, of course, are famous for their battles over piracy, and for the longest time they insisted that downloadable music only be sold with DRM protections.

Ironically, Amazon.com now sells DRM-free MP3 music, as do many other websites. But that evolved only after years of heel digging and foot dragging by the brain-dead music industry that would have much preferred to keep the world stranded in the days of cassette tapes (where bootleg copies get progressively worse with each copy generation).

Today, you can’t buy downloadable audio books without DRM limitations, nor can you download movies without DRM. This content-compromising technology is everywhere, seeking to limit your use of content you’ve already paid for.

That Amazon would sell DRM-encoded books on its own proprietary Kindle device is really no surprise: Selling DRM-free electronic copies of books that could be widely pirated could threaten Amazon’s entire business foundation. Amazon sells books, after all. (Physical ones, printed on paper, with free shipping under their Prime program.)

How to turn your physical books into digital books

I have a much better solution for consumers: Just buy the books at a local bookstore, chop off the binders, scan them and OCR them into text files. Then you can read them on any device (such as a Sony Reader, or your laptop, or whatever).

Of course, it’s a big operation: A good book binding chopper costs $1500 – $2000. A good double-sided scanning machine that can handle large books costs another $3000 or so. Decent OCR software costs another $300, and then you have to go through the song and dance of actually OCRing the files on a Windows computer somewhere. Not many people are willing to go through this trouble to read some books. But I am. Of course, I have other uses for the same equipment, so it’s easier for me to justify. Today, I have more than 1,500 books that I’ve scanned into text files. They all fit on an SD card that plugs right into a Sony Reader. (This is what I carry with me when I travel.)

Given the relative ease of doing this, it’s probably only a matter of time before the book industry faces its own Napster — an offshore website where you can pay a monthly fee and download non-DRM scans of popular books.

Even now, you can download music, movies and all sorts of other content from similar sites operating outside the laws of the United States (like MP3Fiesta, MP3Panda, MovieBerry, etc.). Somewhere, somebody is probably gathering up the world’s best-selling books, scanning them into PDF documents and preparing to unload them onto the world in exchange for a monthly fee.

If Amazon.com continues its Big Brother shenanigans with Kindle owners, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a whole lot of people ditching Kindle and switching to buying DMR-free text books from pirate sites. The advantage of pirated content is that nobody can remotely delete it from your hard drive. The disadvantage, of course, is that authors and publishers don’t get paid a percentage of the sales. And that means pirates would be doing to authors what publishers already do to authors: Screwing them over.

Just say NO to Kindle

I don’t own a Kindle. Never had any interest in a device with DRM control over the books I supposedly “buy.”

I like Amazon.com, but I don’t trust ’em. And this massive deletion of 1984 on Kindle devices demonstrates exactly why I don’t trust ’em.

Amazon engages in a tremendous amount of psychological profiling in order to make recommendations for related products you might want. By storing your entire purchase history (and wish list, and browsing history), Amazon’s computers know far more about you than you might suspect: They know where you live, your gender, your hobbies and interests, whether you have kids and probably even a whole lot about your love life. By profiling the (DRM) books you read and the (DRM) movies you rent (through their movie service), they can assemble very accurate psychological profiles describing your views on gun rights, abortion, terrorism, health freedom, environmental protection and many other topics.

With this information, Amazon customers who buy “fringe” books (like books on “survival”) could easily be flagged and handed over to U.S. government authorities. I’m not aware of Amazon.com abusing this information in any nefarious way (yet), but the fact that it exists on their servers — and that they could abuse it if they wanted to — is cause for some concern.

Perhaps this “accidental” deletion of the book 1984 from Kindle devices was a covert warning. Maybe there’s a rebel technology expert working inside Amazon.com that’s trying to send a message of freedom to all the Kindle owners: Beware of Big Brother Amazon.com! Deleting the book 1984 would be a clever way to send such a message (if anybody picked up on it).

Amazon, of course, claims it was all just a snafu. And they’re sorry. And it will never happen again. And the fact that it reportedly happened to some books by Ayn Rand is also just pure coincidence… imagine that…

Okay, sure, if you trust Amazon.com then keep buying all your books digitally, giving Amazon.com complete control over your library. On the other hand, if you’d rather maintain control over your own library, just pop into a local bookstore, plop down some cash and buy a real book that you can take to your real home where you can really sit down and read it on your real toilet like a normal human being instead of some electronically-enslaved consumer leashed to a digital tether from Amazon’s servers.

Buying Amazon-controlled electronic ebooks is, in my view, a complete waste of money. (And I even like the company!) What you buy today can be taken away from you tomorrow.

Don’t hand Amazon.com control over your personal library. Just say NO to Kindle… and NO to DRM in general.",conspiracy
899,"A Bigfoot watch group in McDowell County, North Carolina claims they may have had a recent sighting of the legendary creature.

BIGFOOT 911, based in Marion, N.C., describes itself as a place to discuss investigations and evidence. It has over 1,200 members, according to the Facebook page.

On the group's page, John Bruner described the sighting, writing he and his group saw a “large bipedal animal covered in hair” in the glow from his headlamp. After being spotted, the creature ran off, though Bruner followed and spotted it again, this time where a tree had been broken in half.

MONSTER CROC THE SIZE OF AN SUV CAUGHT IN AUSTRALIA

“It’s face was solid black no hair on it, the hair looked shaggy all over,” Bruner added.

The creature ran off again, with Bruner saying he saw its buttocks flex with each step. After a short while, something threw rocks at Bruner's group while they were exiting the woods.",mainstream
694,"Bigfoot n. - large, hairy, humanoid creature said to wander the wooded wilds of the Pacific Northwest. Also known as Sasquatch (Canada), the Yeti or Abominable Snowman (Asia), Mapinguari (the Amazon) and Yowie (Australia).

In the Himalayas there's an old Sherpa saying that, ""There is a Yeti in the back of everyone's mind; only the blessed are not haunted by it.""

Many cultures have legends about solitary man-beasts, and recorded sightings in North America and Asia date back to the early 1800s. Despite numerous sightings, photos and footprints of often questionable origin, there has never been conclusive proof that these creatures exist. No droppings, no bones, no hair and no bodies found - alive or dead.

The tuft was collected by residents in Teslin, Yukon, who claim to have found it in a massive footprint left behind by a 3m-tall human-like creature which tromped through their backyards earlier this month.

Wildlife geneticist Dave Coltman expects that the hair will have come from a known mammal such as a bear or bison, but says he is curious enough to test this theory. ""If Sasquatch is indeed a primate, then we would expect the sample to be closer to humans or chimpanzees or gorillas. That would be kind of cool, wouldn't it?""

Regardless of his findings, the myth of Bigfoot does not need hard facts to persist.

Ralph Gray Wolf, an Athapaskan Indian from Alaska, has told reporters that Sasquatch makes appearances to help troubled communities ""get more in tune with Mother Earth"", bringing a message that there is a need to change.

Nor are such creatures confined to the vast, isolated tracts of land in North America and Asia - in the UK, such legends date back centuries.

Two years ago, investigators and the media descended on Bolam Lake, near Newcastle, following a spate of sightings of a tall, shadowy figure over the previous 18 months. In their week in the wooded, lakeside park, six of the party spotted the so-called Beast of Bolam.

Richard Freeman, of the Centre for Fortean Zoology centre, says one of his colleagues was among the witnesses.

""What they saw was not Bigfoot, or Sasquatch as I prefer to call him; it was an enormous shadowy figure in the trees, more like a ghost than flesh-and-blood. In a park not far from a city centre, you're not going to get a nine-foot ape-like creature - England doesn't have the habitat to support it.""

His theory is that sightings such as this - and Scotland's Big Grey Man of Ben MacDhui and the Grey King in Wales - are of a paranormal being.

""I don't mean that these are the ghosts of some creature which has died; I think it is more complex than that.""

In his time as a professional monster hunter, Mr Freeman has travelled the world gathering tales of weird and wonderful creatures - and in every culture, the same types crop up time and again. He calls it the ""international monster template"", which is made up of dragons and other huge reptiles; large ape-like creatures, such as Sasquatch and the trolls of Medieval Europe; little people, such as fairies and goblins; giant birds; and phantom dogs and cats.

""I believe these are analogues of the creatures which inhabited the plains of Africa millions of years ago, which our ancestors would have had to deal with. We now have a fossil memory of these creatures. Under certain conditions, the human mind creates 3D images of these analogues.""

Sceptics such as Benjamin Radford, of the Skeptical Inquirer magazine, also believe that such sightings are our minds playing tricks on us. For it is actually very easy to fool ourselves into believing what we want to believe.

""If they're already thinking that there's a Bigfoot in the area, it's easy to make the leap between saying: 'I saw something, I don't know what it is,' to: 'I saw something and it's Bigfoot.'""

As for the latest find, it will soon be known whether the hair is from a creature thus far unknown to science. And until then, the truth simply lies in the eye of the beholder.",mainstream
601,"Evaluation is an essential component of providing high‐quality, culturally appropriate child welfare policies and practices in tribal contexts. Yet, little research has been carried out with respect to child welfare evidence‐based practices in American Indian or tribal (Indigenous) settings to promote the development of working theoretical models or identify effective practices for evaluation. The reason for the lack of evidence‐based child welfare practice may be an artifact of methodologies that are not based on Indigenous worldviews and that can be considered invasive when imposed by outside funding agencies (LaFrance & Nichols, 2009, 2010).

This lack of Indigenous models led the Children's Bureau in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to convene an expert group focused around developing or forwarding culturally engaged evaluation of American Indian child welfare services. In partnership with JBS International, the Children's Bureau convened an American Indian/Alaskan Native workgroup (the tribal evaluation workgroup [TEW]) tasked with engaging stakeholders in conversations about how to build and disseminate evidence of effective child welfare practices, strengthen evaluation practice, and promote the use of findings for making sound decisions in child welfare programs and systems. The workgroup included members from tribal communities working in child welfare, evaluators with extensive experience in tribal contexts, university researchers working with American Indian and Alaskan native populations, technical assistance providers, and federal partners from the Children's Bureau, the Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation, and the Administration for Children and Families. The resulting product was “the roadmap for co‐creating collaborative and effective evaluation to improve tribal child welfare programs,” hereafter referred to as the Roadmap (TEW, 2013).

The Roadmap identifies several culturally engaged evaluation strategies to assess the achievement of local, community‐generated program goals. TEW members reflected on best practices gleaned from their extensive collective experience and demonstrated work with American Indian and Alaskan native communities. The reflection process was layered and rich due to the diversity in the group, which included those working in different geographic areas, in small and large programs, and in local, regional, state, and international settings. The workgroup reviewed existing research, discussed how evaluation aligned with the current challenges facing tribal communities, and shared specific evaluation cases to inform the conversation about lessons learned that could be shared more broadly.

Through the sharing of experiences, the group continually revisited the need for evaluation to describe a “new narrative,” encouraging the involvement of the tribal community in designing, implementing, and analyzing their own tribal programs. The TEW was determined to create a formative evaluation process tool that tribal communities could use to tell their story about the realities of providing services in their tribal context. The process tool should help tribal communities take credit for their many promising and best practices service models. Ultimately, the TEW sought a model that builds tribal evaluation capacity while demonstrating its intrinsic value.

A contextual acknowledging of the impact of intergenerational trauma, supporting tribal sovereignty, and telling an indigenous story of practice development are critical elements of good evaluation practice in tribal communities. Shifting the narrative of evaluation is best accomplished from a place that acknowledges tribal communities for the depth of their resilience and wisdom, which ultimately determines community and program goals. The Roadmap challenges users to identify “cultural protocols for community‐engaged, comprehensive evaluation,” community‐generated evaluation protocols, and the use of key stories to support interpretation of evaluation data. Where these protocols and guidelines (stories) may not exist in a formal way, the Roadmap prompts users to identify how cultural values can ground and inform evaluation work. It places rigorous cultural considerations in conjunction with evaluative rigor (TEW, 2013). The process serves to instill a respect for the culture's values in understanding and measuring change.

The Roadmap has implications for policy and the field of evaluation. First, it calls for a community‐driven process for determining evaluation goals, benchmarks, and impact measures. Discussions about validity in the context of scientific rigor are juxtaposed against discussions about meaningfulness in the context of cultural rigor. Second, the Roadmap emphasizes the importance of scenario development to inform evaluation practice. Rather than employing abstract tools and metrics, the Roadmap encourages users to develop local stories and scenarios to inform and document decision‐making in evaluation. Third, it encourages ongoing reciprocal knowledge‐building for both outside evaluators and tribal program staff, while acknowledging the role and power of communities in directing/guiding evaluation efforts.

The development of evaluation and programming around the Roadmap elicits an engagement with community that has rarely been accomplished with the previous standards of practice. Indian country historically relied on their cultural knowledge‐based processes, grounded in value‐laden social engagement, that have guided their survival efforts for centuries. The development of tribal community strength models allows the engagement of culture and other forms of community resilience, while advancing this process as an integral formative procedure. These guiding considerations are often embodied in the program being assessed and may be critical to the effectiveness of the cultural engagement. Such readiness and formative evaluative processes truly allow for a strength‐based or resilience‐based model of knowledge development and knowledge engagement.

The many calls in the literature to abandon a one‐size‐fits‐all approach to American Indian community‐based evaluation reinforce the role of a strong community‐driven process. The Roadmap encourages a formative process of community engagement and collaboration, which allows for a constellation of community‐driven efforts. This has utility and meaning in informing community and program alike. The establishment of best practices and, eventually, evidence‐based practices may reveal themselves through use of such modeling and collaboration. It is likely that these community‐driven standards will be important in the formation of new evidence‐based practices within American Indian communities. The evaluative process not only serves to engage and empower the community, but also to enhance the community's concept of itself as effective and important in the generation of outcomes that are tribally identified as useful.

Fundamentally, the concepts of enriching the community sense of self‐exploration for truly effective services affords an investment to community process and community change suggestive of the listening and engaged evaluator process described by Trimble, “Río,” and Bernal (2010) in their article, “Silencing of the Self.” In their conceptual framework, the authors propose a way of engagement with Native communities by a cultural joining of efforts. This joining of efforts involves an understanding and learning process of community engagement. The engagement is marked by the silencing of one's authoritative or critical self in favor of a humble request to learn with the community. This joining is not marked by the far too often held evaluation or critical model of taking from the community but is linked to a concept of exploration with the community of practice and application.

There is a risk for academics and evaluators to assume a role of holder of knowledge about constructs, measures, and methods that will serve a community in need of these very skillsets. These assumptions are fraught with deficiencies. An alternative position of the community as the holder of the knowledge set which guides the evaluative collaboration is important. This frame or manner of engagement with community has been described as a form of “cultural humility.” Cultural humility is about accepting the evaluators’ limitations. In a humble and respectful collaboration, the community organically holds the knowledge constructs that have utility for the community and the indigenous methods to use as indicators or measures. In addition, this frame encourages growing a continual process of evaluation which informs the community as well as builds a process for nonjudgmental quality assurances. Practitioners of cultural humility work to increase their self‐awareness of their own biases and perceptions and engage in a life‐long self‐reflection process about how to put these aside and learn from community (Tervalon & Murray‐Garcia, 1998). The Roadmap, and the structural engagement processes outlined with the model, build on an assumption of cultural humility as important in formative learning. Cultural humility is specifically about accepting our limitations. Those who practice cultural humility work to increase cultural self‐awareness of their own biases and perceptions and engage in a life‐long self‐reflection process about how to put these aside and learn from the community (Tervalon & Murray‐Garcia, 1998).",mainstream
393,"Found in the middle of Juba, safely defused by the UN Mine Action Service, averting potential disaster.

The voice of the head of the UN Mine Action Service in South Sudan rings out across the open field.

Then a loud thud is heard in the distance.

For the crowd gathered to watch the defusing of a 50kg bomb found in the middle of Juba, the muffled “whump” heard from within the bunker is strangely disappointing.

But a more spectacular explosion would have been a sign that things had actually gone terribly wrong for the mine action team, which specializes in disposing deadly weapons.

The bomb is likely to have been dropped from an aircraft years ago, during the war of independence in South Sudan. No one knows how it suddenly turned up in the middle of an open field next to a football pitch where children have been playing, and near a community of thousands of displaced families.

“The key message is that people should not touch items like this,” says Richard Boulter, the programme manager of UNMAS in South Sudan. “Simply report it. Let us go out and decide whether it is dangerous. If people pick things up and bring them to us, they are taking an unnecessary risk – not only to themselves, but to their family, friends, children and complete strangers. It’s simply not necessary.”

As soon as the bomb was discovered, the UNMAS team launched into action to secure it, defuse it and safely remove it from the area for final disposal.

It is painstaking work. The team members spend hours in the hot sun building a protective structure around the bomb, with the help of engineers from the UN Mission in South Sudan. They fill the bunker with 50 tonnes of sand to absorb fragments from an unexpected blast, should the explosive accidentally go off. A special firing pin is attached to the bomb to disable the fuse so it cannot ignite. A cable is carefully laid out from the bomb shelter to the team managing the process from a safe distance. All the safety checks are laboriously carried out, and then it is time to push the detonation button.

This time, the Head of the UN Mission in South Sudan does the honours. With one push of a button, the bomb is declared disarmed.

“This may be a routine job for UNMAS but it’s an incredibly important one right across South Sudan,” says David Shearer. “As the war has continued over many, many years, there have been ordnances and this sort of ammunition that has been found that has causes all sorts of injuries and deaths. The job that UNMAS is doing here today is a small part of what they do right across the country. We’re very pleased with their efforts and very proud of what they do to make people safe.”

In the next few weeks, UNMAS expects to dispose of the one millionth unexploded ordnance in South Sudan since 2004. Their records include hand grenades, mortars, artillery rounds and land mines, weapons which have had a deadly impact on the local population.

“Last year South Sudan passed the 5,000 figure for people killed or injured,” says Richard Boulter. “The last mine accident in this country happened yesterday, when an innocent woman trod on a land mine and lost her foot. It’s a very real danger. It’s still out there and we are working hard to clear this threat.”

The Mine Action Service is an integral part of the UN peacekeeping mission. It surveys and clears mines, ammunition stockpiles and other unexploded ordnances, clears roads so humanitarian workers and local people can travel safely, and educates communities about the risks and how to report explosive hazards.

The defusing of the bomb caused huge community interest, with dozens of people stopping by to see the bunker and talk to the specialist team once the area had been declared safe. The event even prompted local police to come forward about a similar device that has been lying near their station for years. This bomb will be disposed of just as quickly and efficiently by the mine action experts as they continue their efforts to protect the people of South Sudan.",mainstream

Regularly held in July of each year, it is valued by both hardcore genre film fans, and distributors, who take advantage of the eclectic line up to select foreign and domestic films for release across North America.[citation needed] By virtue of the reputation developed over the last 15 years, this festival has been described as perhaps the ""most outstanding and largest genre film festival in North America"".[1]

The history of the Fantasia Festival has roots in the Asian Film scene in Montreal. Beginning in 1996 where it screened Asian films from Hong Kong and Anime from Japan, the festival later expanded its international repertoire and screened genre films from all across the world.[citation needed] Since this time many world and international premieres have featured at Fantasia fest, including Shaun of the Dead, Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, Midnight Meat Train, Dread, The Sorcerer’s Apprentice and Uzumaki.

Among the many North American premieres have included Ringu, Inglourious Basterds, Thirst, We Are What We Are, Visitor Q and Night Watch.

The Creeping Garden was one of the featured films in the 2014 Festival.

Fantasia 2012 featured the screenings of the films Toad Road, Doomsday Book, the horror anthology film V/H/S, Hidden in the Woods (original version), Seediq Bale, and Quentin Dupieux's Wrong.[2]

Fantasia 2011 opened the 2011 edition of the festival with the Canadian Premiere of Red State. The festival also featured the presentation to John Landis of a lifetime Achievement award.

In the process, corporations are seeing proof that productivity does not suffer, and employees may not need to return to offices in order to be productive and accomplish their work tasks. It also may be part of required cost-cutting as companies plan for what could be a prolonged global economic slump. Nationwide announced on Wednesday a permanent transition to a hybrid work model. The insurance company will operate in their four main corporate offices in central Ohio; Des Moines, Iowa; Scottsdale, Arizona; and San Antonio, while the majority of their locations will continue working from home.

""We've been investing in our technological capabilities for years, and those investments really paid off when we needed to transition quickly to a 98% work-from-home model,"" Nationwide CEO Kirt Walker said in a statement. ""Our associates and our technology team have proven to us that we can serve our members and partners with extraordinary care with a large portion of our team working from home."" Nationwide plans on exiting all other locations by Nov. 1, 2020. During its earnings call on Tuesday, CEO Dirk Van De Put of food giant Mondelez said the company is making some adjustments that will make it easier for the company in a recession, including a rethink of where people work. ""Maybe we don't need all the offices that we currently have around the world. So there is a major effort going, taking place as it relates to the costs in the business,"" the Mondelez CEO said. Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman is uncertain about what work life will look like after the pandemic but said the bank would need ""much less real estate"" in the future. About 90% of Morgan Stanley's employees have been working from home during the pandemic.

""We've proven we can operate with no footprint,"" he said in a recent Bloomberg TV interview. ""Can I see a future where part of every week, certainly part of every month, a lot of our employees will be at home? Absolutely."" Barclays CEO Jes Staley said this week that putting thousands of workers in a corporate office building may never happen again. ""There will be a long-term adjustment in how we think about our location strategy ... the notion of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past,"" he said in public comments this week after the company's earnings. The outlook implies harder times for the commercial real estate industry, as the corporate reductions will come at the same time that retail and restaurant businesses may have to unwillingly vacate their commercial leases. Commercial property has spent years soaring but fell 1.3% in March, according to Green Street's Commercial Property Price Index, and many investors expect commercial real estate to remain under pressure. WeWork recently stopped paying some rents.

During the first two weeks of the coronavirus outbreak, over 2,600 borrowers with commercial mortgage-backed securities loans needed potential debt relief, according to Fitch Ratings. It tracked 47% of the relief request to hotel assets and 30% to retail properties. J.C. Penney missed a $12 million corporate bond interest payment and is now considering bankruptcy as the pandemic continues to hinder its plans for a turnaround. Gap stopped paying rents in April. Hedge fund icon Carl Icahn said in March that shorting commercial real estate was among his biggest bets. In the least, workers can expect the reinforcement of social distancing, more employees working on a semiregular basis and new designs at their offices. Property managers and designers are already anticipating the layout and designs of future office spaces. The building layout will discourage the spread of germs and new seating arrangements, while new technology could give employees access to conference rooms and elevators without having to touch doorknobs or press buttons. Previously open floor plans were highly encouraged, since it promoted unity and collaboration throughout the office. These new office adjustments will instead mirror trends from a decade ago, when cubicles and more personal offices were the norm.",mainstream
455,"The Saga Of The Ingrown Toenail

. . . began Monday when I got out of bed. It’s anyone’s guess what vexed my big toe on my left foot the night before. As I put on my sock I felt a snag. My toenail had developed this ridge, causing the side to rise up and hook into anything dragged across its surface. As the sock tugged on the toe the situation unveiled itself in its entirety. In the front of the toe was a portion, going directly down into the quick. That’s what you call an attention getter.

Few things in this life can compare with the pain of an ingrown

toenail. Maybe having sex with a mountain lion. Rising out of bed you do the one-foot hop to the bathroom to do your morning ritual. You look like a dog, having one foot in the air. Then, of course, comes denial.

When you first encounter the ingrown toenail you cling to the vain hope that it’ll just ”grow out.” I mean, how did God, in all His wisdom make the thing go down in the first place? Surely it will see the error of its ways eventually and simply return to normality. Ingrown toenails don’t think that way.

Then you pass on to the endurance phase. You figure you can tough it out until the pain subsides. You only have to make small adjustments. Such things as going to the bathroom, standing and cooking, wearing shoes, and sleeping.

Then comes acceptance. At long last, you look at it. All men have at least one renegade toenail. That’s one of the reasons we get undressed in the dark. It has nothing to do with anything Masters and Johnson wrote about. It’s all about that one toenail that looks like a Frito!

So, there you are looking at this thing. The reason you let it get this far in the first place is that this particular toe has always been an ugly little bastard. Your agreement with it was so long as it kept to itself and didn’t hurt you it was live and let live. Well, the toe broke the treaty.

You gently touch it. There is no doubt that this little guy is definitely plugged in. But, you’re a MAN. One little jerk and the problem will be solved. Ingrown toenails have roots extending all the way to your butt! You give it that first jerk and you discover that you weren’t that much of a man after all. (Note: This is a real Frito standing in for the Toenail.)

So you hop to the kitchen with your butt slammed shut and retrieve a large pan. Usually the pot roast pan. That’s about the size of a foot. Noticing a roast thawing on the counter you make a note to self to wash the pan when you’re done. No one is home except your eight-year-old grandson so whose to know, right? You fill the pan with very warm salty water and begin trying to soak the toenail into submission. After twenty minutes or so you pull out the foot and with the toenail now softer, begin to dig around it with a fondue stick. If you can just. . .butt slams shut again

Next comes the toenail clippers. Too small. Scissors. Bigger scissors. GARDEN SHEARS! The bad news is here you sit going after your toe with a hedge clipper. The good news is it seems to be working. Oh, you’re not going anywhere near the ingrown part. No, you believe if you can file the overall width and length of the toenail in general down that it may give the ingrown part room to grow, and eventually alleviate the situation.

Along comes your grandson. You discover that you’re jealous of his healthy toes. Inside your evil heart you know he’ll grow his Frito someday, but he’s standing there asking you what’s this all about.

You explain to him that the toenail has burrowed into your toe and you’re trying to work it free.

”Why don’t you just pull it out?”

”It hurts too bad so I’m using these scissors to trim around it.”

After you think about it you consider that perhaps he MAY be able to do some good from a different angle. And besides, he’s just a little guy, what harm can he do?

So he takes the large scissors and begins to try to trim the ridge. No luck. He studies the toe and again positions the scissors near the ridge, clasping onto it, slightly digging the blades into to nail. You smile. He can’t make the cut. But, he thinks he’s helping grandpa. How sweet. It’s right about then he does some kind of a rotation maneuver, pops the entire toenail, ingrown part and all, right off the toe and you lose your three best hemorrhoids!

He sits there smiling, ”Feel better Papa?” Well. . . yes! Yes, it does. The pain was so excruciating that your toe lost it’s mind and stopped hurting. An hour later when feeling returns there is no offending ingrown toenail, therefore, there is no more pain! You pay your grandson with hot chocolate and put the toenail into a medicine bottle to show friends.

932,"The Bermuda Triangle is an infamous region in the Atlantic Ocean off the eastern seaboard of the United States. The mysterious area marked by the Florida panhandle, Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles has inexplicably swallowed more than 50 ships and 20 airplanes, leaving no trace.

Few people these days remember the ill-fated Navy ship USS Cyclops which vanished in the Bermuda Triangle seas in March 1918. But it was big news in its time because there were no survivors and the wreck was never found.

Weird doings in the Bermuda Triangle had been reported since the mid-1800s. Ships were found abandoned with no crew aboard (or dead bodies) and no sign of mishap. In other cases, vessels were able to transmit a distress signal but had disappeared by the time help arrived. Sometimes, the rescue missions vanished, too.

The Cyclops was massive, measuring 540 feet long (an American football field is 300 feet between goal lines) and 65 feet wide. The collier, as it was called, was built to haul coal. Capable of holding 12,500 tons of coal, the steamer could make 15 knots (17 mph).

The winches aboard the collier could transport 800-pound bags of anthracite (hard natural coal) along cables. Huge clamshell buckets could scoop up two tons of coal at a time.

The Cyclops was launched in May 1910 and one job: to provide fuel for the naval fleet. The hard work on the floating coal mine (as one newspaper described it) was considered high-risk. Cargo holds loaded with petroleum-based fuel caught fire and bucketloads of coal sometimes tumbled to the deck, along with all the other risks mariners face, from weather to equipment failure.

After the Navy sailors fired up the steam engines and debarked from Norfolk, Virginia in 1910, the monster cargo ship proceeded south along the Atlantic Coast to U.S. bases in Cuba, Haiti, and Puerto Rico to carry out its duties.

The United States entered World War I in April 1917 and equipped the Cyclops with 50-caliber guns to defend its mission ferrying doctors and medical supplies from the Johns Hopkins Hospital to Saint-Nazaire in war-torn France.

Months after completing that assignment, the collier took on more than 10,000 tons of manganese ore in Brazil. The crew was inexperienced in handling manganese ore which is more dense and heavier than coal.

The ship left Rio de Janeiro on February 16, 1918, and arrived in Bahia on February 20.

A logbook entry made in Bahia, Jamaica, listed several problems with the collier which was running on only one of her two engines, floating low in the water due to the unusually heavy load, and lifting heavy in the water.

Captain Worley submitted a report to his superiors that the starboard engine had a cracked cylinder and wasn’t operative. The Navy’s reply was to delay repairs until the vessel returned stateside.

Two days later, the Cyclops with 309 crew members debarked for the steelyards of Baltimore with no scheduled stops.

However, the collier did make an unplanned landing in Barbados on March 3. Cpt. Worley paid a call on U.S. consul Brockholst Livingston and the Cyclops took on additional cargo. At this point, officials in Barbados reported the Cyclops was overloaded, evidenced by water was over the Plimsoll line.

On March 4, 1918, having taken on enough supplies for nine days at sea, the Cyclops followed her plotted course through the Bermuda Triangle, destination Baltimore. The Navy ship was never heard from again and vanished with no sign that anything was wrong.

The military began an exhaustive search for the missing coal transport:

“Navy cruisers scoured the trade routes, scouted the beaches, inspected remote bays. Crews radioed the lost ship day after day, but nothing — no reply, no debris, not even an oil slick. Out in the West Indies, the ship had vanished.”

The 309 crew members of the ill-fated Cyclops were presumed lost at sea. The sad news was announced by future President Franklin Delano Roosevelt who was then beginning his career as Assistant Navy Secretary.

The puzzling case of the lost Cyclops remains the greatest loss of life unrelated to combat in the annals of U.S. naval history.

Theories abounded to explain the unexplainable. The manganese ore had riven the hull or releases toxic gases that overwhelmed the men aboard. Enemy submersible U-boats attacked with torpedoes – but no debris was ever found. Stormy seas could have sunk the Cyclops but none were charted and no distress call was received.

One possibility that made the rounds was that German navy raiders could have seized the ship, kept the crew as hostages, and piloted the valuable vessel across the Big Pond. The big problem with this idea was that the Cyclops didn’t have enough fuel to cross the Atlantic Ocean.

Unorthodox explanations were also advanced, including falling space rocks (meteorites), a mutiny or perhaps the Atlantic version of Loch Nessie.

Then, on December 5, 1945, Five Avenger bomber planes took off from the U.S. Navy base in Florida and never returned. The aircraft was code-named Flight-19. After the official final report cited “Reasons Unknown” as the cause of the abrupt mass disappearance of men and machines, Flight-19 became known as the Lost Patrol.

It was then that the Bermuda Triangle became linked to mysterious vanishings on or over the water. This area is also a UFO hotbed.",conspiracy

734,"Pelosi: Boasting of Elite Lifestyle Better Than Injecting 'Lysol in Somebody's Lungs'

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) defended her recent ""Cribs"" style interview, where she boasted about her elite lifestyle in front of $25,000 fridge stocked up with organic ice cream.

During Tuesday's edition of MSNBC’s “Deadline,” Pelosi blasted President Donald Trump for calling her out on her freezer full of ice cream at the White House.

“The Democrats, they don’t want to come back. I think they should be back here, but they don’t, they’re enjoying their vacation…If you look at Nancy Pelosi eating ice cream on late-night television.”

“It’s such a good point that as you’re talking, I’m trying to figure out what John McCain or John Boehner, what their profanity-laced response would have been, that I couldn’t have put on this program but that you certainly would have heard and I might have heard about injecting bleach.”

“So rather than spending talking about the president saying we are injecting Lysol in our lungs —he mades a big fuss about my having ice cream in my freezer,"" she added.

""That is his latest today, his most current today, she has Lysol in her freezer. I have ice cream in my freezer,"" Pelosi said.

""I guess that’s better than having Lysol in somebody’s lungs as he is suggesting.”

“Again, enough of him, enough of him, it’s not worth it to just dwell on him,"" the Hosue speaker blasted.

""We have to go forward, and the Republicans will have to make their own decision.""

The ad has come as a direct response to Democrats stalling to replenish the PPP.

935,"Pablo Picasso: playwright? The first of two plays written by the Spanish artist will receive a reading at the Guggenheim in New York next week, to coincide with an exhibition of his black-and-white work.

Composed in 1941, during four days of illness, Desire Caught By the Tail is a surrealist, non-linear farce that reportedly out-Becketts Samuel Beckett. Its second act consists of five pairs of feet outside the doors of hotel rooms, saying ""My chilblains. My chilblains. My chilblains."" This is then followed by a stage direction that calls for ""the dancing shadows of five monkeys eating carrots"".

The six-act play is described by the Guggenheim as a reflection of a day-to-day life in Paris during the second world war, though its original translator Bernard Frechtman argued otherwise. ""It says nothing of human destiny or of the human condition,"" he wrote in his introduction. ""This in itself is a considerable achievement.""

Anne Bogart will direct the reading, which will be performed on 8 and 15 October, with a cast that includes the playwright John Guare, the artist's granddaughter Diana Picasso, and Richard Armstrong, the Guggenheim's director, in the role of Silence. Other characters in the play include Onion, Big Blonde Curtain and the protagonist Big Foot.

The play's first performance, a reading at the Paris home of writer Michel Leiris, took place in March 1944 and featured Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre and Valentine Hugo, as well as Picasso himself. Albert Camus directed. It was revived by the Guggenheim in 1984 with David Hockney and Louise Bourgeois in the cast.

819,"The first time Dave Shealy saw a skunk ape, he says, he was ten years old. It was 1974, a few years after his father had come upon a set of footprints left by the creature—an Everglades version of Bigfoot named for its supposedly pungent odor. Dave was out deer hunting with his older brother, Jack, in the swamp behind his house, in what’s now Big Cypress National Preserve, when he encountered the ape incarnate.

“It was walking across the swamp, and my brother spotted it first. But I couldn’t see it over the grass—I wasn’t tall enough,” Shealy says. “My brother picked me up, and I saw it, about 100 yards away. We were just kids, but we’d heard about it, and knew for sure what we were looking at. It looked like a man, but completely covered with hair.”

He and his brother stared at the creature, mouths agape, but almost at the same time, as he tells it, the skies opened and rain poured down. The ape hurried away, into the cypress hummocks scattered amongst the marsh. “Holy crap,” he remembers thinking. “I finally saw this damn thing, and it got away, just like that.”

But the fleeting moment left an indelible impression on young Shealy, who’s now 50 years old. In the decades since, he’s relentlessly pursued skunk apes and seen them, he says, on three other occasions. He’s written a field guide, made TV appearances, continually investigated reported sightings and established a Skunk Ape Research Headquarters on his property, where tourists can learn all about the legendary creature. He bills himself as the Jane Goodall of skunk apes. “I am the expert,” he told a Bigfoot website last year, “the state and county expert on the Florida skunk ape, and have been for years.”

In July 2000, he captured one of his encounters on video. In the grainy daytime footage, shot from hundreds of feet away, the creature spends a minute or so moseying around in a hummock of palm trees. Then, shortly after it begins striding across the open swamp (at about 1:48 in the video below), it breaks into a long-limbed run—as though suddenly aware it’s being watched—escaping into a grove of palm trees.

Shealy notes that, at the time, the swamp was covered by over a foot of water, making the animal’s speed (which he estimates to be 22 miles per hour) impossible for any human to achieve. But it’s extremely hard to watch this video and see anything but a guy in a gorilla suit, hurrying across the swamp:

This impression is especially concerning because, according to any respected biologist, the skunk ape does not exist. “People report seeing this mythical creature from time to time,” says Bob DeGross, a public affairs officer with the preserve. “But there has never been a substantiated sighting of the skunk ape that was verified by National Park Service wildlife staff.” Critics point out that, despite the dozens of unrelated ongoing research projects conducted in the Everglades that use motion-activated trail cameras, no one has ever captured indisputable proof of the skunk ape or come upon the remains of one. “The empirical evidence is extremely weak,” says Sharon Hill, a researcher and columnist for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry who’s written about Bigfoot, the skunk ape and other mythical creatures. “It’s almost entirely eyewitness testimony, which is the most unreliable evidence you can have.”

Shealy responds by observing that things decompose quickly in the swamp, and that, at 2.2 million acres, it’s the largest area of protected land east of the Mississippi, most of it rarely visited (both true). It’s easy to imagine, he argues, that a handful of reclusive animals could live in it essentially unnoticed and leave virtually no evidence. “I know what I’ve seen,” he says. “For someone who hasn’t come here and put in the time to say otherwise doesn’t really matter to me.”

To a curious observer, all this prompts an important question. Is Shealy a visionary biologist, a mistaken eyewitness, or an enterprising fraud?

Earlier this year, to try answering this question, I made the trip to Shealy’s property in Ochopee, Florida, an hour’s drive into the Everglades from the west. A few minutes after I arrived, Shealy met me at the research headquarters (which also serves as a gift shop that sells skunk ape T-shirts and shot glasses, a campground, a base for Shealy’s staff of five to give swamp buggy and airboat tours, and a home for his menagerie of ten-foot-long pythons and talking parrots).

“I was out hunting frogs until 4:30 a.m. last night,” he told me, “and I’ve got a whole pile of them that need skinning. Want to help?” A tall, bearded man, Shealy stared at me with an intense gaze, as though waiting for me to freak out, then began to chuckle, saying he was joking, and would be skinning them all himself. After retrieving a sackful of wriggling frogs from the fridge inside his house behind the gift shop, he sat down on his deck, began hacking them apart and started telling me about the skunk ape’s long history.

“Local Native American groups from around here, the Seminoles and the Miccosukee tribe, they’ve known and told stories about the skunk ape for centuries,” he said. Over the past 60 years or so, Floridians of all stripes began reporting that they were seeing the creature. (A similar pattern happened in the Pacific Northwest, where indigenous beliefs in the Sasquatch eventually led to the skunk ape’s better-known cousin, Bigfoot.)

In one of the earliest well-publicized sightings, a pair of hunters claimed the ape invaded their camp in 1957. It’s unclear who coined the name skunk ape, but it appears to have surfaced sometime during the '60s. During the 1960s and '70s, the period when Shealy had his first sighting, more and more reports trickled in, as far north as the Florida panhandle, but most often in the Everglades. The skunk ape eventually attracted mainstream attention, including a bill introduced (but not passed) in the Florida legislature in 1977 that would have made it illegal to “take, possess, harm or molest anthropoid or humanoid animals.” It was around this time that Shealy, a teenager, spotted evidence of the creature for the second time, in the form of enormous four-toed footprints left at night near his hunting camp deep in the Big Cypress interior.

Occasional sightings continued for years, and the skunk ape hit the news again in 1997, when passengers on a tour bus traveling through the preserve claimed they spotted the animal. “This was 30, 40 people, all saying they saw the same thing,” Shealy says, “a seven-foot, red-haired ape.” After decades of idle interest in the creature, he decided to get serious about finding it, baiting the area with lima beans (the story goes that the omnivorous apes loved the legume). He repeatedly found the beans missing in the morning, along with tracks left in the night. Then, just two miles away, a pair of local residents—Jan Brock, a real estate agent, and Vince Doerr, chief of the Ochopee Fire Control District—separately spotted a large, hairy biped minutes apart while driving through the preserve one morning in July. “The thing just ran in front of my car,” Brock told me when I called her after my visit. “It was shaggy-looking, and very tall, maybe six-and-a-half or seven feet tall.” Doerr, who told me that he’d never believed in the skunk ape before seeing it cross the road about a half mile in front of his car, snapped a photo of it just before it vanished into the swamp.

“I’m going to spend the next six months looking for this thing,” Shealy remembers vowing at the time. “I’m not going to do anything else. Every day I’m going to get up and go looking and keep doing this until I see it.”

Shealy set up a few tree stands on his 30-acre property, and spent the next year sitting in them, baiting the area and watching for the skunk ape, or trekking across the Everglades, trying to find the creature’s trail. Finally, on September 8, 1998, he says, he was rewarded with his second sighting. Perched in a tree and half asleep, “I heard something splashing in the water: splash, splash, splash,” he told me. “At first, I thought it was a person, but then from around 100 yards away, I saw it coming toward me. It was a skunk ape, the same as I saw when I was a kid.” As it walked by, unaware of being observed, he shot several photos of it, watching it disappear into the nearby tree hummock. Later, he returned and made a concrete cast of its footprint, which still sits in the gift shop.

After he finished skinning the frogs, Shealy fried me a few pairs of legs for lunch and told me about his two most recent sightings: Once in 2000, when he filmed the video clip, and the latest in August 2011, when he was picking saw palmetto berries in the swamp and was startled by an unforgettable odor. “Right away, I could smell it—kind of like a wet dog and a skunk, mixed together,” he said. It emerged from behind a palm frond, spotted Shealy and bolted, leaving no evidence.

He still searches for the skunk ape, concentrating his work mostly in March and April—when the dried-out swampland allows for easier hiking and preserves tracks better—and investigating the dozen or so sightings that are called in to him annually. He’s boiled his findings down into a field guide, available for $4.95 at his gift shop (the skunk apes stand six to seven feet tall, spend about half their lives in the trees, and might pick up their awful odor from their time in underground alligator caves, it says), and mapped the most recent sightings. He was even filmed for an episode of “Finding Bigfoot,” the Animal Planet reality show, although he was infuriated when the producers balked at the logistical difficulties of traveling into the swamp to investigate a sighting and asked him to “fake it” in his backyard instead.

Of course, many people question Shealy's authenticity—something that weighed upon me as I ate the lunch he’d made for me and politely listened to his claims. Apart from the sheer unlikeliness of the skunk ape’s existence, critics point out that Shealy openly profits from the supposed animal, selling tchochkes and offering swamp tours. In 2000, he even applied for a grant from the Collier County Tourism Development Council to fund his research, and some remarked upon the conveniently timed release of his skunk ape footage shortly before the hearing, along with the dubious creature in the video. “The skunk ape, which bears a striking resemblance to a guy in a monkey suit, was filmed walking across a clearing,” Naples Daily News columnist Brent Batten wrote at the time. “Anyone who previously doubted the existence of the skunk ape should now be converted. The same way that anyone who doubted the existence of flying saucers carrying evil space aliens would have a change of heart after seeing Plan Nine from Outer Space.”

The belief in mythological animals might be as old as humanity itself. Nearly every culture’s folklore contains at least one imagined creature in its folklore that has no place in modern science. You’ve likely heard of the Loch Ness Monster and Bigfoot, but there are thousands of others. In the Philippines, people have long feared a vampire-like animal called the Aswang. British folklore prominently features supernatural black dogs associated with death that roam the countryside. Other places have aquatic monsters, enormous worms or massive, lizard-like demons.

It’s easy to imagine how, in the days when much of the planet had yet to be explored and catalogued, you might have reasonably believed in the existence of any of these beasts. But in the present day, when every square mile of the earth’s surface has been photographed by satellites, and scientists have identified 1.3 million species (with mostly plants, tiny animals and microbes remaining to be found), how could you still believe in a lumbering, seven-foot-tall ape, hiding out in one of the most well-studied countries on the planet?

“In the context of the modern world, where truth is provided by the consensus of mainstream science and medicine, I think many people feel disempowered,” says Peter Dendle, a professor at Penn State University who’s written extensively about folklore and cryptozoology (the search for cryptids, animals that aren’t recognized by the scientific community). “I think cryptozoology serves as a means of staking a line, and saying, 'You scientists don't know everything. There are still truths out there to be discovered.'” Cryptid enthusiasts, he’s found, are disproportionately male and often share a number of outsider traits that I couldn’t help but see in Shealy: a distaste for authority, a rugged connection with the outdoors and a hearty sense of individualism and self-reliance.

Psychologists, meanwhile, have observed an overlap in people who believe in cryptids and those who suffer from psychological conditions including ADHD, depression and even dissociation. These underlying disorders, it’s speculated, increase the chance that people will incorrectly interpret an otherwise explicable real-world experience. In other words, a psychologically stressed or unstable person might catch a brief glimpse of a deer or bear far away in the woods and become certain it’s a bipedal hominid heretofore undiscovered by science.

On an individual level, it’s easy to see how a one-time mistake like this could persist. “These people invest time, effort and money into this activity, which they’re passionate about,” Sharon Hill, the skeptic, told me. “They have a sense that they’re doing something with a higher purpose. Maybe they’ll be the one to finally solve the mystery, and they’ll become famous and respected—something that they might not have in their life otherwise.” This sort of belief is self-reinforcing: Admitting that a cryptid is nonexistent would mean giving up the years they’ve devoted to the search thus far. The only option is to keep looking, certain that indisputable proof is just around the corner.

Any of these explanations should imply that, when I followed Shealy into the muddy swamp after lunch—to the spot where he’d spotted the skunk ape in 2000—I shouldn’t have had even the slightest expectation that we’d see one in the flesh. But as we walked along the meandering trail, listening to the drone of insects and the squawking of birds overhead, part of me held a faint hope that he wasn’t crazy or self-delusional, that he really had seen the creature and that there was a tiny chance we would too. “In this digital age, the world suddenly feels very, very small,” Dendle, the folklore expert, told me. “There’s a sense of claustrophobia, and a loss of wonder. Cryptozoology is a way of refusing to have the last piece of the unknown taken away—of imagining there’s something bigger than us out there.”

There aren’t many rational reasons to believe the skunk ape might be real, but after doing some digging, I was able to find exactly one: The line between real animals and cryptids, it turns out, is much messier than you might imagine. Carl Linnaeus’ 1735 landmark text of modern biology Systema Naturae listed the pelican, antelope and narwhal as cryptids. As recently as the start of the 20th century, the Komodo dragon, the giant squid and the okapi were thought to be cryptids, before the Western scientific establishment changed its mind in the face of indisputable evidence: the animals' dead bodies.

This still goes on. Dozens of new mammal species have been discovered since the start of the 21st century, although they’re generally less extraordinary cases, often the result of subtle taxonomic changes. Perhaps the most well-known of these is the olinguito—the first new carnivore discovered in the Americas in 35 years—which was announced in August 2013. The small, arboreal animal had eluded the scientific community for all of modern history, confused for its close cousin, the olingo. That the olinguito was overlooked is all the more remarkable because thousands of the animals live in the cloud forests of Colombia, dozens of their skulls and furs have been preserved in museum collections, and one individual olinguito actually lived in the Smithsonian’s National Zoo for a few years in the 1960s.

“I think that there’s just a lot out there that most people don’t know about, that we really don’t understand about the world,” Shealy told me as I followed him down an overgrown path into the swamp at the rear of his property. I couldn’t help but recall what Kristofer Helgen, the National Museum of Natural History zoologist who discovered the olingutio, told me just before the press conference announcing it. “The discovery of the olinguito shows us that the world is not yet completely explored, its most basic secrets not yet revealed.”

Some Bigfoot believers argue that the creatures could be a tiny relict population of an ape species thought to have gone extinct millions of years ago, such as Gigantopithecus or Paranthropus. If so, it certainly wouldn’t be the first species to be resurrected. One, the Chacoan peccary—a wild pig-like mammal native to South America—was initially known only from fossils found during the 1930s. Then, in 1971, scientists realized thousands of the animals were alive and well in the Chaco region of Argentina. During the intervening decades, biologists had been certain that the peccary was long extinct. Local residents, meanwhile, were aware of the animal’s existence the entire time.",mainstream

Discussion and Screening - When Television Became BIG

 Thursday, May 14, at noon, Jefferson Room 

 By the mid-1950s, television had arrived. In 1954, when 80 percent of all American living rooms had a television set, a Senate investigation examined the role of television in the growing problem of juvenile delinquency. A chart used in those hearings is part of the exhibit ""BIG!"" Independent scholar David Weinstein (The Forgotten Network: DuMont and the Birth of American Television) will discuss the early days of television and how it evolved and grew during the 1950s. Joining Weinstein will be Arthur Forrest, who in the late 1940s (as a teenager) began a distinguished television career at WABD in New York. He later worked as a cameraman and director on such shows as Captain Video, Wonderama, and The Jerry Lewis Telethon. Also joining in the discussion will be Jim Silman, who began at WTOP-TV in Washington, DC in 1951, and went on produce and direct such local kid shows as Pick Temple’s Giant Ranch and Ranger Hal, eventually becoming WTOP’s Program Director. The program will feature clips from classic television shows of the 1950s. This program is presented by The Charles Guggenheim Center for the Documentary Film at the National Archives.

Author Lecture on BIG Economic Impact - The Forgotten Man: A New History of the Great Depression

 Saturday, May 27 at noon, Jefferson Room 

 Amity Shlaes discusses her book The Forgotten Man: A New History of the Great Depression, which draws parallels between the Great Depression and the current economic situation. Shlaes rejects the conventional interpretation that the Depression represented capitalism’s failure and that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s (FDR) New Deal helped Americans weather hard times. She argues that it was Government intervention that made the Depression great and that seeking to act like FDR today will create large-scale budgetary obligations. A book signing will follow the program.

1002,"In 1972, Harvard paleontologist discovered the remains of several massive pre-historic turtles while on a research expedition in northern Venezuela. Now, nearly fifty years later, scientists report the discovery of additional specimens of the same ‘giant turtle’.

Just how big was the ‘giant turtle’?

The giant turtle is the largest known turtle species to have ever existed. Tipping the scale at an estimated 2,500 pounds, the giant turtle was 100-times heavier than its closest known turtle relatives. The turtle’s shell alone was up to 9 feet long - that’s 2 feet longer than the standard bed!

Why was this turtle so big?

The giant turtle’s massive weight may have helped it stay underwater for long periods to graze on underwater plants. However, the turtle’s massive size likely came at a cost - this turtle was probably a very weak swimmer.

Indeed, the male giant turtle came equipped with horns on its shell. “The two shell types indicate that two sexes of [the giant turtle] existed - males with horned shells and females with hornless shells,"" explains Marcelo Sánchez-Villagra, who recently led a study on the giant turtle.

While it is not clear if the turtle’s horns were useful in battle, the giant turtle likely contended with large enemies. Most of the fossilized giant turtle remains discovered coincided with findings of the world’s largest caimans, Purussaurus. Not to be outdone by the giant turtle, these giant caimans were about thirty-four feet long and may have weighed up to 18,500 pounds - 7-times the weight of the giant turtle. Bite marks and punctured bones on some of the fossilized giant turtle shells further suggest caiman attacks occurred.

What caused these giants to go extinct?

The giant turtle and the giant caiman co-existed with the largest known crocodile and with rodents the size of modern-day buffaloes at Lake Pebas in the western Amazon. Lake Pebas formed during the uplifting of what is now the Andes Mountains, which began accelerating 20 million years ago. The rising Andes eventually interrupted the flow of the Amazon River, trapping the water to form the Lake.

However, as the Andes continued to rise, the Amazon river was eventually forced to change course and began flowing towards the Caribbean. During this slow process, Lake Pebas was gradually drained, become a mega-swamp.

The most recent data suggest the mega-swamp still existed 8.5 million years ago, providing habitat for these giant animals. However, the geological forces uplifting the Andes eventually drained the swamp completely, ending Lake Pebas and its giant creatures.",mainstream

547,"Bigfoot is a 1970 independently made American low budget science fiction film, produced by Anthony Cardoza and directed by Robert F. Slatzer. The film stars or co-stars a few well-known actors (and family namesakes): John Carradine, Chris Mitchum, Joi Lansing, Ken Maynard, Doodles Weaver, and Lindsay Crosby.

This exploitation film attempts to transform the Pacific Northwest Sasquatch man-beast into an old-fashioned movie monster, ala King Kong (as a quote on the original film poster proudly trumpets). A remake, of sorts, using the same title, Bigfoot, was made for and shown on basic cable's SyFy Channel in 2012.

Fast-talking Jasper B. Hawks drives through the forest in his car, along with his sidekick Elmer Briggs. At the same time, pilot Joi Landis pilots a single engine aircraft over the same area. Joi's engine conks out, and she is forced to parachute to safety. On the ground, she suddenly encounters a Bigfoot creature that emerges from the woods and attacks her.

Laconic biker Rick rolls into the woods with his girlfriend Chris. She stumbles onto a Bigfoot burial ground and is also attacked by a Bigfoot.

A skeptical Sheriff's department and the ranger's station are notified of the women's disappearance, but to no avail; the authorities make a half-hearted search for the missing women and give up. Rick seeks help elsewhere, but only Jasper B. Hawks believes his story, offering aid only because he plans on capturing a Bigfoot for later live exhibition in a freak show.

Meanwhile, Peggy is also attacked and tied up to a tree next to Joi. The Bigfoot creatures, it turns out, are the offspring of a larger, 12-foot tall male Bigfoot and have only been guarding the woman for him. ""Dad"" Bigfoot finally shows up and fights a big bear menacing the captured women, while they scream in terror.

Jasper, Elmer, and Rick trek through the woods until they reach the Bigfoot lair. ""Dad"" Bigfoot is gassed by Rick's bikers, and as planned gets put on display in Jasper's previously mentioned freak show. As it turns out, he is able to escape captivity rather quickly, while in the process stepping on local drunk, ""Lucky Bob"", killing him. ""Dad"" Bigfoot goes on a rampage through the town before finally returning to his cave. There, he eventually gets blown up by one of Rick's dynamite-wielding bikers.

His freak show prize now lost to him, Jasper paraphrases a line of dialog from the original King Kong (1933): ""It was beauty that did him in"". With ""Dad"" Bigfoot now dead, everybody returns to their normal lives.
• James Stellar as Bigfoot: ""The Eighth Wonder Of The World""

Portions of Bigfoot were shot in mountain wilderness locations in northern California where some Sasquatch sightings have been reported over the years. Other outdoor scenes were shot at Tehachapi Mountains, California, while other scenes were shot indoors using sets on a sound stage.[1] Bigfoot was a typical example of the low-budget feature films that emerged in the 1970s.[2]

For both Joi Lansing and western star Ken Maynard, Bigfoot marked their final screen roles.[3]

Film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his film review: ""The cast alone convinced me. Let me put it as simply as I can: If you have ever wanted to see a movie starring John Carradine, Joi Lansing, Lindsay Crosby, Chris Mitchum, and Ken Maynard, then Big Foot is almost certainly going to be your only chance. Not since Joan Crawford starred in Trog has there been such an opportunity"". Ebert, however, was very much aware of how hopeless Bigfoot was as a film.[4] On his website Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings, Dave Sindelar wrote, ""It's got more than its share of dull, boring sequences, especially the endless scenes of the bikers tooling around, but I have to admit to finding this one a little irresistible"".[5]",mainstream
558,"Groupers are fish of any of a number of genera in the subfamily Epinephelinae of the family Serranidae, in the order Perciformes.

Not all serranids are called 'groupers'; the family also includes the sea basses. The common name 'grouper' is usually given to fish in one of two large genera: Epinephelus and Mycteroperca. In addition, the species classified in the small genera Anyperidon, Cromileptes, Dermatolepis, Gracila, Saloptia, and Triso are also called 'groupers'. Fish in the genus Plectropomus are referred to as 'coralgroupers'. These genera are all classified in the subfamily Epiphelinae. However, some of the hamlets (genus Alphestes), the hinds (genus Cephalopholis), the lyretails (genus Variola) and some other small genera (Gonioplectrus, Niphon, Paranthias) are also in this subfamily, and occasional species in other serranid genera have common names involving the word ""grouper"". Nonetheless, the word ""grouper"" on its own is usually taken as meaning the subfamily Epinephelinae.

Groupers are Teleosts, typically having a stout body and a large mouth. They are not built for long-distance, fast swimming. They can be quite large, and lengths over a meter and the largest is the Atlantic goliath grouper (Epinephelus itajara) which has been weighed at 399 kilograms (880 lb) and a length of 2.43 metres (8.0 ft),[2] though obviously in such a large group, species vary considerably. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it. They do not have many teeth on the edges of their jaws, but they have heavy crushing tooth plates inside the pharynx. They habitually eat fish, octopuses, and crustaceans. Some species prefer to ambush their prey, while other species are active predators. Reports of fatal attacks on humans by the largest species, such as the giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) are unconfirmed.[3]

Their mouths and gills form a powerful sucking system that sucks their prey in from a distance. They also use their mouths to dig into sand to form their shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through their gills.

Research indicates roving coralgroupers (Plectropomus pessuliferus) sometimes cooperate with giant morays in hunting.[4]

The word ""grouper"" is from the Portuguese name, garoupa, which has been speculated to come from an indigenous South American language.[5][6]

In Australia, ""groper"" is used instead of ""grouper"" for several species, such as the Queensland grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus). In the Philippines, it is named lapu-lapu in Luzon, while in the Visayas and Mindanao it goes by the name pugapo.[citation needed] In New Zealand, ""groper"" refers to a type of wreckfish, Polyprion oxygeneios, which goes by the Māori name hāpuku.[7] In the Middle East, the fish is known as 'hammour', and is widely eaten, especially in the Persian Gulf region.[8][9]

According to the 5th edition of Fishes of the World the subfamily is divided up into 5 tribes containing a total of 32 genera and 234 species.[10][11]

Groupers are mostly monandric protogynous hermaphrodites, i.e. they mature only as females and have the ability to change sex after sexual maturity.[12][13] Some species of groupers grow about a kilogram per year and are generally adolescent until they reach three kilograms, when they become female. The largest males often control harems containing three to 15 females.[12][14] Groupers often pair spawn, which enables large males to competitively exclude smaller males from reproducing.[12][15][16][17] As such, if a small female grouper were to change sex before it could control a harem as a male, its fitness would decrease.[15][16][17] If no male is available, the largest female that can increase fitness by changing sex will do so.[16]

However, some groupers are gonochoristic.[12] Gonochorism, or a reproductive strategy with two distinct sexes, has evolved independently in groupers at least five times.[12] The evolution of gonochorism is linked to group spawning high amounts of habitat cover.[12][16][18] Both group spawning and habitat cover increase the likelihood of a smaller male to reproduce in the presence of large males. Fitness of male groupers in environments where competitive exclusion of smaller males is not possible is correlated with sperm production and thus testicle size.[14][16][19] Gonochoristic groupers have larger testes than protogynous groupers (10% of body mass compared to 1% of body mass), indicating the evolution of gonochorism increased male grouper fitness in environments where large males were unable to competitively exclude small males from reproducing.[14]

As other fish, groupers harbour parasites, including digeneans,[20] nematodes, cestodes, monogeneans, isopods, and copepods. A study conducted in New Caledonia has shown that coral reef-associated groupers have about 10 species of parasites per fish species.[21] Species of Pseudorhabdosynochus, monogeneans of the family Diplectanidae are typical of and especially numerous on groupers.

Many groupers are important food fish, and some of them are now farmed. Unlike most other fish species which are chilled or frozen, groupers are usually sold live in markets.[22] Many species are popular fish for sea-angling. Some species are small enough to be kept in aquaria, though even the small species are inclined to grow rapidly.[citation needed]

Groupers are commonly reported as a source of Ciguatera fish poisoning. DNA barcoding of grouper species might help in controlling Ciguatera fish poisoning since fish are easily identified, even from meal remnants, with molecular tools.[23]

Malaysian newspaper The Star reported a 180 kg (400 lb) grouper being caught off the waters near Pulau Sembilan in the Strait of Malacca in January 2008.[24] Shenzhen News in China reported that a 1.8 m (5.9 ft) grouper swallowed a 1.0 m (3.3 ft) whitetip reef shark at the Fuzhou Sea World aquarium.[25]

In September 2010, a Costa Rican newspaper reported a 2.3 m (7.5 ft) grouper in Cieneguita, Limón. The weight of the fish was 250 kg (550 lb) and it was lured using one kilogram of bait.[26] In November 2013, a 310 kg (680 lb) grouper had been caught and sold to a hotel in Dongyuan, China.[27]

In August 2014, off Bonita Springs in Florida (USA), a big grouper took in one gulp a 4-foot shark which an angler had caught.[28][29]

739,"A Canadian court has dismissed a Bigfoot-believer's lawsuit claiming British Columbia failed in its duty to recognise that sasquatches exist.

Todd Standing tried to get the province to acknowledge that the giant, ape-like figure was ""an indigenous mammal living within British Columbia"".

He also claimed the province infringed on his fundamental rights regarding his concern for the creature.

The province argued the civil claim lacked ""an air of reality"".

In a recent decision, British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Kenneth Ball found no reasonable cause for the lawsuit and said the court had no power to compel the province to conduct scientific investigations of its flora and fauna.

The judge also dismissed the claim that Mr Standing's rights were being violated, stating that the province had never placed restrictions on his Bigfoot-related interests.

1330,"Monos is set in a South American paradise but comes off like Lord of the Flies in hell. Following an eight-strong group of teen soldiers and their adult prisoner of war, it is sensual, and gorgeous and intensely, continuously disturbing. The kids – Dog, Lady, Bigfoot, Boom-Boom, Rambo, Swede, Wolf, Smurf – are left to their own devices except for the occasional visit from “the Messenger”, who works for whatever organisation has recruited them. So they scrap and kiss and fire their AK-47s into the sky.

Alejandro Landes, the film’s 39-year-old director, says it doesn’t matter who they’re fighting for. “Colombia’s been war-torn for so many decades. I’ve seen that violence happen from the left and I’ve seen it happen from the right. My grandfather’s favourite place in the world, his farm that he worked all his life to buy, became the headquarters for the most gruesome rightwing paramilitary group, the AUC, and I’ve had part of my family kidnapped by guerrillas.”

Who, exactly? “My grandfather’s sister, my cousin … things like that.” Were they freed? “Some yes, some no. So that is something that I had seen and experienced.” These experiences inspired and informed Monos.

We’re given no specifics of time and place – it’s somewhere in Latin America. Landes, who lives in New York, has Colombian roots but grew up in Ecuador, his parents having left Medellín in the 1980s to escape the violence. To find his actors, he and his producers sifted through 800 tapes, selecting 25 possibles totake part in a mock training camp for four weeks in the Andes. Most had never acted before, though there was one major exception: Moisés Arias (Bigfoot) was a regular in Miley Cyrus’s Disney series Hannah Montana. One they saw on a tape playing basketball, a kid with a close crop, referred to on the court as Matt, but in fact named Sofia (Buenaventura). She plays Rambo in the film and, says Landes, “was very inspirational for the fluidity of the character”. He calls the character, who is written as male, “post-gender”.

Researching the film, Landes visited Colombian reinsertion camps, meeting adult rebel fighters who had laid down their guns and wanted to enter civil society. In one he found Wilson Salazar, a man with dwarfism who became a child soldier at 11 and deserted when he was 24. There was a sizeable price on his head, dead or alive. “He was very good at what he did,” says Landes. “He had risen to be part of a column called Teófilo Forero, one of the most feared combat units. He was an amazing destroyer of things.”

Landes hired Salazar as a military consultant, then asked him to play the Messenger, too, as he was so convincing. At the camp, Salazar woke his young charges at 4am each day. They’d undertake acting exercises in the mornings, and in the afternoons Salazar would give them clandestine military training. “It was intense,” says Landes. “It was a boot-camp scenario – the kids were living, sleeping, eating together, everything together, all at the same time.” Landes then selected his eight, tweaking the screenplay to fit.

The shoot was yet more full-on. The opening mountaintop segment was shot at almost 14,000ft (4,300m): punishingly cold and wet. “You move slower up there,” says Landes. “There’s low oxygen, you move in a bit of a daze.” On the first day, someone from the camera department had an epileptic seizure. A baptism by fire, thought Landes; things will get easier. They did not. For four weeks, the 55-strong cast and crew filmed in the jungle around the Samaná river, five hours south-east of Medellín. Mules carried their food; Colombia’s national kayak team helped with filming on the rapids; a family of local gold miners built their military tents. There was no electricity, no running water, no refrigerated food and torrential downpours all night every night. There were food rations. The shoot took its toll.

“People were dropping like flies, including me,” says Landes. “Everyone had their day. Everyone cried on this movie. You’re working six-day weeks, very high-intensity scenarios.” Landes himself was working seven-day weeks. One morning he woke up and couldn’t move. The gold miners put him on a stretcher and carried him up a canyon until they reached a local medical centre. He cried on the journey, distraught that the production might collapse. He was back behind the camera 20 hours later. “I think it was just the stress,” he says. “And the ration diet.”

It was worth it. The film has earned universal raves – and a special prize in San Sebastián film festival, Spain, for accurately reflecting “the values and reality” of LGBTQ people. The story is a nightmare in which nothing – gender, sexuality, political allegiance – is muddled or irrelevant. “It’s not binary. That’s why I think it reaches much further than Colombia. That is what’s most timely and relevant. I wanted to make sure that the film spoke not to the moment but to us as a species.”

483,"Decades after foot-binding was outlawed in China, a British photographer has met some of the last women subjected to the practice.

It was with a sense of pride that Su Xi Rong revealed her feet to British photographer Jo Farrell.

Her feet, bound from the age of seven, were so small that she had been renowned for their beauty.

The 75-year-old is among the last remaining women in China to bear the effects of foot-binding, a practice first banned in 1912.

Farrell met more than 50 of them over an eight-year period, and says she was surprised to find stories of pride and empowerment. Her book about the women is being launched at the British Council in Hong Kong on Monday.

Foot-binding was believed to create a more beautiful foot and promote obedience.

Despite a ban, it carried on in many rural areas until the Cultural Revolution began in 1966.

Travelling in Shandong and Yunnan provinces, Farrell found grandmothers who were happy to show the effects created by years of strapping their toes under their feet.

""I feel so many people talk about how barbaric the tradition was, but it was also a tradition that empowered women,"" Farrell says.

""It gave them a better life. They were doing the best for themselves.""

Because of feudal traditions, women with large feet were not likely to get married.

Matchmakers picked women who had bound feet because it showed they could ""tolerate"" pain and ""she would not complain as a wife,"" explains Farrell.

""I think one of the most important things that came across was that they have a pride in what happened to them.

""Most of them told me or showed me how their feet had been much smaller before,"" she said.

Su Xi Rong recalled how her grandmother would catch her trying to remove the strappings from her feet as a child and punish her by slicing flesh off her toes.

But when Farrell arrived with her Hasselblad camera Su Xi Rong was proud to pose for photos.

""She was happy to show me her feet because she was known as the woman with the most beautiful feet in the village.""

Most of the women are in their eighties and nineties, and several have passed away since they were photographed.

""It feels good to get their stories down before they disappear,"" says Farrell.

Not all women had an adult forcing the binding on them.

""I would say about 40% of the women bound their own feet, which I found quite surprising,"" says Farrell.

""They wanted to be like other girls. Some women said they knew how to do it because they had seen their mothers do it.""

Over a period of time, the small bones in the toes would break beneath the weight and the foot arch would lift so that a woman's heel would almost touch the metatarsals.

Jo found those who felt resentful did so because they had had to work in the fields.

""It would have been much easier to do if they hadn't had bound feet,"" she said.

She says a lot of the women confided they would not bind their feet if they could ""have their time again"".

From 1949, when the Communist Party came to power, the women found their feet, the products of imperial sensibilities, were now the focus of scorn.

""These women went through a very hard time,"" says the photographer.

""Originally they were praised for their bound feet but then by 1949 it became something that they were embarrassed about and ashamed of. To go through both of those things in one lifetime is incredible.""

Today, she says the elderly women she found were ""spritely"", and says she was surprised by their mobility.

""On a few occasions I had to search the village for the ladies. They were visiting other ladies or looking after grandchildren.

Most of her subjects she found through word of mouth.

The first woman she photographed, Zhang Yun Ying, was the mother of a taxi driver.

Farrell also became adept at spotting the gait of women with bound feet, once stopping a taxi and getting out because she spotted a woman walking in the street.

""They tend to walk on their heels,"" Farrell says.

She found in a lot of cases younger relatives had never asked their grandmothers about their bound feet, or seen them naked.

Some young people were reluctant to let China be shown ""in a bad light"".

She said the project taught her a lot about old age and how the women seemed to be ""invisible"". Often they appreciated someone coming to see them to find out their stories.

Interviewing 87-year-old Cao Mei Ying, Farrell said she could not understand what the lady was saying to her - but that she held onto her tightly.

She asked her translator, who said: ""She doesn't want you to leave.""

""I made her feel special and remembered,"" recalls Farrell. ""That her path in this life had meant something.""",mainstream
137,"A little more than a year ago, Sir Terry Leahy, who is the chief executive of the Tesco chain of supermarkets, Britain’s largest retailer, delivered a speech to a group called the Forum for the Future, about the implications of climate change. Leahy had never before addressed the issue in public, but his remarks left little doubt that he recognized the magnitude of the problem. “I am not a scientist,” he said. “But I listen when the scientists say that, if we fail to mitigate climate change, the environmental, social, and economic consequences will be stark and severe. . . . There comes a moment when it is clear what you must do. I am determined that Tesco should be a leader in helping to create a low-carbon economy. In saying this, I do not underestimate the task. It is to take an economy where human comfort, activity, and growth are inextricably linked with emitting carbon and to transform it into one which can only thrive without depending on carbon. This is a monumental challenge. It requires a revolution in technology and a revolution in thinking. We are going to have to rethink the way we live and work.”",mainstream
294,"Gangrene is a serious condition where a loss of blood supply causes body tissue to die. It can affect any part of the body but typically starts in the toes, feet, fingers and hands. Gangrene can occur as a result of an injury, infection or a long-term condition that affects blood circulation.
• redness and swelling in the affected area
• either a loss of sensation or severe pain in the affected area
• sores or blisters in the affected area that bleed or produce a foul-smelling pus You should see your GP immediately if you're worried you may have gangrene. Read more about the symptoms of gangrene and diagnosing gangrene.

Anyone can develop gangrene, particularly after a serious injury, but there are certain groups of people who are more at risk. These include people with long-term conditions that can affect the blood vessels, such as:
• diabetes – a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high
• atherosclerosis – where the arteries become clogged up with a fatty substance called plaque, narrowing them and restricting blood flow
• peripheral arterial disease – where a build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries restricts blood supply to leg muscles
• Raynaud's – where blood vessels in certain parts of the body, usually the fingers or toes, react abnormally to cold temperatures Read more about the causes of gangrene.

The earlier treatment for gangrene begins, the more successful it's likely to be. The main treatments include surgery to remove damaged tissue, known as debridement, and antibiotics to treat any underlying infection. In some cases, surgery may be needed to restore blood flow to the affected area. In more severe cases, it may be necessary to remove an entire body part such as a toe, foot, or lower leg. This is known as amputation.

Many cases of gangrene can be prevented. If you have a condition that increases your risk of getting gangrene, such as diabetes, it's important you have regular check-ups to assess the state of your feet. Report any problems to your GP as soon as possible. Stopping smoking if you smoke and adopting a healthy lifestyle, with a low-fat diet and regular exercise, can also improve your circulation and reduce your risk of developing gangrene.",mainstream
710,"THE FBI were called in to probe whether or not the legendary Bigfoot was actually real, newly released documents reveal.

The top secret papers disclose scientists from the organisation even carried out scientific tests on ""hair or fur"" said to be from the mythical apeman.

Peter Byrne, then the director of the Bigfoot Information Center, wrote a letter in 1976 asking that the FBI ""set the record straight, once and for all"".

His call came after it was reported the bureau had analysed hair or fur that was not identifiable as ""that of any known creature on this continent"".

FBI Assistant Director Jay Cochran, who headed the bureau's lab division at the time, responded that he was unable to find any records of such an examination, the papers reveal.

However, Byrne, then requested an examination of what he saw as an exciting new sample of Bigfoot fur.

""We do not often come across hair which we are unable to identify and the hair that we have now, about 15 hairs attached to a tiny piece of skin, is the first that we have obtained in six years which we feel may be of importance,"" Byrne wrote.

Cochran responded saying while the FBI usually focused on criminal investigations ""in the interest of research and scientific inquiry, we make exceptions to this general policy"".

An image released by the FBI shows a hair and tissue sample sent to the FBI labs in the 1970s What is Bigfoot and does it really exist? Bigfoot, also known as Sasquatch, is said to be a giant ape-like creature that is said to roam the Northwest of the US. There is scant evidence such creatures exist, but Bigfoot buffs are convinced they do - and science will one day prove it. While most sightings occur in the Northwest, the mythical creatures have been reported all over the country. The most famous image of a Bigfoot is from a film taken in 1967 by Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin in Bluff Creek, California. It shows a huge dark, man-sized and man-shaped figure lumbering through a woodland clearing. While widely considered a hoax, it remains to this day the best evidence for the existence of Bigfoot. ""With this understanding, we will examine the hairs and tissue mentioned in your letter."" The sample was then analysed to check its ""structure and thickness"" before being compared ""with hairs of known origin under a comparison microscope"". However, the eventual results were not as Byrne had hoped, reports CNN. ""It was concluded as a result of these examinations that the hairs are of deer family origin,"" Cochran later revealed. The FBI made public 22 documents from it records archive on Wednesday - including its bulging 22-page Bigfoot file. Peter Byrne’s web page says that he “has always had an interest in the unknown and the mysterious” since his father used to tell him bedtime stories about the Yeti of the Himalayas. The page reveals he first started looking for the Yeti in 1946 when he was still in the British Royal Air Force in Bombay, India.”",mainstream
1261,"Traveling at nearly 20,000 miles an hour, 1998 OR2 passed within four million miles of our planet last week, or roughly 16 times farther than the moon. While this distance is no cause for concern, 1998 OR2 is continuing on its 3.7-year orbit around the sun, venturing into the asteroid belt beyond Mars and circling back inside Earth’s orbit with each lap. On its next approach to our planet in 2078, it will be much closer, swinging within about a million miles of Earth. After a few hundred years, astronomers can’t calculate exactly where 1998 OR2 will be.

NASA classifies anything over 140 meters (about 459 feet) wide that passes within five million miles of Earth as a potentially hazardous asteroid. “Five million miles comes from how much orbits can change over time, and a little bit of a margin put on it, of course, to be sure that we capture anything that might be a potential impact hazard in the future,” Johnson says.

In just seven years, another huge asteroid called 1990 MU, nearly two miles wide, will pass within three million miles of Earth.

“We don’t want to get hit by something that big,” Johnson says. “Our most important task is finding them and getting a fuller catalogue of everything that’s out there, so we don’t get surprised.”

In 1998, the U.S. Congress directed NASA to detect and characterise at least 90 percent of potentially hazardous asteroids measuring one kilometre (about 3,200 feet) across or larger. Seven years later, the space agency was directed to find 90 percent of nearby asteroids that are 500 feet wide or larger.

The bigger asteroids, including 1998 OR2 and 1990 MU, could devastate life across the planet if they hit. “It is estimated that asteroids of one kilometre or more would result in continent-wide devastation, and the dust injected into the atmosphere would cause drastic cooling and the possibility of global crop failures for at least a few years,” says Jay Melosh, a geophysicist at Purdue University.

We’ve found roughly 900 of these larger objects, or 95 percent of the estimated total population. None are even remotely likely to hit the planet in the next several centuries. But of the smaller group, which could still destroy cities, we’ve only detected roughly 30 percent of the estimated 25,000 objects, according to a report from the National Science and Technology Council.

“These smaller ones—the sub-global sizes that are capable of causing regional problems—we still have a lot of work to do,” Mainzer says. “Searching for these gray or black rocks against the blackness of space—it’s just a hard problem.”

Even space rocks smaller than 500 feet wide can be extremely dangerous. Some meteors explode in the sky with the strength of nuclear bombs, such as one that burst over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013. At only 66 feet wide, this fireball meteor caused a shock wave that hit the city, shattering glass and resulting in about 1,500 injuries. No one saw it coming.

When it comes to stopping an asteroid from colliding with Earth, warning time is the name of the game. With years or even decades to prepare, humans could nudge even the largest asteroids off course.

NASA’s DART mission, scheduled for launch in July 2021, will test one strategy by slamming a half-tonne spacecraft into an approaching asteroid. In October 2022, about seven million miles from Earth, the refrigerator-size spacecraft will approach a half-mile-wide asteroid called Didymos, which is orbited by a 500-foot-wide moon.

“Didymoon,” as the smaller body is affectionately called, is DART’s target. It’s roughly the size of asteroids that can obliterate cities. Ground-based telescopes will be able to detect changes in the duration of its orbit around the larger asteroid to measure the effects of the impact.

“If it wasn’t a binary, it would be basically impossible to measure with high precision,” says Megan Bruck Syal of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who uses a mix of lab tests and supercomputers to model asteroid impacts. ”This is a remarkable opportunity to test the effectiveness of the kinetic impactor technology on a real asteroid.”

Shortly before DART smashes into Didymoon at roughly 14,700 miles an hour, the spacecraft will release a shoebox-size camera made by the Italian Space Agency. The camera will watch as the spacecraft smashes into Didymoon, taking pictures of the spray of debris and perhaps even of the resulting crater. Johnson says he expects the collision could decrease the moon’s 12-hour orbit by as much as seven minutes, although the team will consider the mission a success if that change is at least 70 seconds.

“By changing the orbit of the moon, we don’t change the orbit of [Didymos],” Johnson says. “Didymos is a potentially hazardous asteroid, so we don’t really want to affect its orbit. We don’t want to accidentally push it the wrong direction.”

Another spacecraft called Hera, built by the European Space Agency (ESA), will arrive at the two asteroids in 2026 to take detailed measurements of the impact’s aftermath, as well as test autonomous navigation technologies.

Although a “kinetic impactor” strategy is well understood, a number of variables control whether the impact would successfully deflect an asteroid, Syal says. The target body’s composition, strength and structure, how much material is ejected by the impact, and the angle at which the spacecraft comes in are all important factors.

“A ricochet would be a really poor outcome, meaning a lot of the momentum is lost,” Syal says.

Kinetic impactors might successfully redirect an asteroid as small as Didymoon, but what about 1998 OR2? If something that big were on a collision course with Earth, we’d need a bigger strategy, Lu says—such as detonating a nuclear bomb near the asteroid to vaporize part of its surface and push it off course. A nuclear explosion on the asteroid surface itself would risk creating a shotgun blast of fragments still heading for Earth.

Mainzer, who is leading an effort to launch a space telescope dedicated to finding dangerous asteroids, says the most optimal deflection strategy depends both on the incoming object and on how much time we have before impact. To know what will work, we need to practice.

“We see this with climate change, this pandemic, even this [planetary defence] problem—a small amount of preparation makes a big difference,” Mainzer says.",mainstream
390,"Tarek M. speaks with his family in the worn-torn city Aleppo as often as possible. He fled the country in 2015, when he was just 23, traveling on his own through the Balkans to Germany. Because his family remains in Syria, Tarek does not wish to reveal his identity.

Tarek also fled military conscription — he wanted no part in the atrocities carried out by the regime that ruled over the west of the city where he lived with his family.

In eastern Aleppo, the insurgents were able to defy Syrian regime forces for four years until Russia joined the fight for the opposition stronghold. By December 2016, Syria's government had recaptured the entire city.

Today President Bashar Assad's forces, with the help of allies Russia and Iran, control an estimated two-thirds of the country.

""The war in Syria is not over yet,"" however, cautions Tarek.

A bloody battle is expected for the last insurgent and extremist stronghold, Idlib. If it falls, Assad will emerge victorious.

Many cities around the country now lie in ruins. Since the battle for Aleppo, those who remain in the city continue to live in terrible conditions. Tarek, who now lives and works in the Ruhr region of western Germany, passes on his family's reports: The infrastructure in Aleppo is devastated; its water and electricity supply perilous.

In the east of the city, the situation is more desperate, he said. The reports from his parents and the photos and videos circulating online paint a picture of a landscape in ruins.

""Talk of reconstructing the east of the city is pointless,"" said Tarek. ""And even if attempts to rebuild were made, who would receive the funds for it?""

The question of reconstruction is both a crucial and complex one. Above all, who should finance it? Neither the Syrian regime nor Iran or Russia want to bear the costs alone.

The United Nations special envoy for the Syria crisis, Staffan de Mistura, estimates that roughly $250 billion (€215 billion) would be required to rebuild Syria's infrastructure. The Syrian government puts the sum as high as $400 billion.

Russia has called on Europe to provide financial aid for reconstruction efforts. Ahead of her meeting with Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed Germany's and Russia's joint responsibility for a solution to the Syrian crisis. However, the idea of Germany contributing to rebuilding a Syria ruled by Assad does not sit well with many German politicians.

Read more: What is Iran's role in Syria if Assad wins the war?

Nevertheless, the prospect of contributing has not been entirely ruled out in Berlin. In April of this year, for example, at a donor conference for Syria in Brussels, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas stressed that a political solution was a prerequisite for German reconstruction aid. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert also said that Germany intended help in an international effort to rebuild life for regular Syrians.

Speaking to DW, German foreign policy expert Rolf Mützenich of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), reiterated Berlin's stance that reconstruction must be centered around an international agreement. ""One condition [of German contribution] is that there must be a peaceful solution that has been legitimized by the UN,"" he said. ""A solution that also enables all people who want to return to Syria to be able to do so.""

Assad himself has left no doubt as to who exactly will be welcome in his future Syria. The human cost of the war has been immense, but the country has gained a ""healthier"" and ""more homogeneous"" society, he claimed at a conference in Damascus in 2017.

""My impression is that the Syrian leadership systematically depopulated the areas in which the insurgents were strong,"" Guido Steinberg, a Middle East expert from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told DW.

Read more: Idlib's civilians in survival mode for Syrian assault

This strategic motivation is substantiated by the new Law No. 10, which allows the Syrian government to confiscate the property of citizens who have fled abroad if they do not lodge their claims inside the country within a year. The situation leaves open the possibility for a biased distribution of rebuilding resources — favoring areas with Assad regime sympathizers while ignoring areas for the refugees who want to return.

But what can returning refugees really expect from Assad? If they have fled from rebel strongholds, or are known to be opponents of the regime, then ""they can expect to be arrested, tortured and killed,"" said Steinberg.

Putin often mentions the prospect of repatriating Syrian refugees currently in Europe as part of his push for a joint reconstruction effort in the country. The Russian leader knows well how divisive the issue has been in Germany and the European Union.

That approach has drawn criticism, in particular from Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, deputy parliamentary party leader of Germany's pro-business Free Democrats (FDP). Russia is already financially depleted from its military engagement in Syria, he told Die Welt newspaper, and would thus not be a main player in the reconstruction. ""This must not lead to us repairing the roads bombed by Russia and then deporting the refugees via Assad's henchmen to torture chambers,"" Graf Lambsdorff said. Germany must make concrete demands of Russia, he added, but convincing leaders in Moscow of the need for a UN-led political solution is likely to be difficult at this stage.

Steinberg believes that Germany may well eventually participate in the reconstruction of Syria, but doing so is only certain ""if there is the possibility, or even just the prospect, of sending refugees back.""

For the time being, returning refugees to the country they were driven from is not an option, said the SPD's Mützenich.

Even if the political will were there, carrying out those repatriations would be practically impossible, according to Bernd Mesovic of the refugee aid group Pro Asyl. In an attempt to speed up the asylum process, many of the refugees who arrived in Germany in 2014 and 2015 did not sufficiently specify their reasons for leaving their homeland, he explained, making it often impossible to know from which warring faction people fled.

Mützenich believes the focus should be on figuring out how international organizations and UN member states can best participate in reconstruction and under what terms.

Roughly half-a-million Syrians have been killed by regime forces and their allies over the past seven years. Such staggering destruction has critics asking: Is giving Assad financial support for reconstruction in Syria tantamount to complicity?

Read more: Syrian detainee No. 72's tales of torture

""The money would not benefit the normal citizens who are the most in need, but only Assad's friends,"" argued Tarek, who because he fled military service would face imprisonment if he were to return to post-war Syria.

Mützenich understands the hesitation over entering into a reconstruction effort with the Syrian government, but believes it could ultimately be in the best interests of regular Syrians. ""If you approach it from this position alone, which is morally justified, little will be achieved in a practical sense,"" he said. ""In the end, maintaining this stance is not fair on the people who want to try to live in their homeland.""

Steinberg considers German participation in the reconstruction of Syria — under all circumstances — to be wrong. Neither Damascus, nor Tehran, nor Moscow would ever again take Germany seriously as a foreign or security policy power, he said. It was always the motivation of Iran and Russia to stabilize the Assad regime and garner new prestige, Steinberg added, ""and we would thus be promoting the war aims of criminals.""",mainstream
477,"Canadian officials are investigating after a human foot washed up on the shores of British Columbia – marking the 13th time in the past decade that tides have carried a sneaker-clad foot on to its coastline.

The grisly find was made earlier this month by Mike Johns as he walked his dog along the scenic southern coast of Vancouver Island. After a large object tangled in sea kelp captured the dog’s attention, Johns leaned in for a closer look.

What he saw was a fibula and tibia attached to a left foot, all of it encased in a white sock and black Velcro shoe. “By the looks of it, the foot was totally intact. The ankle bone still worked and the bones were attached at the base of the knee,” Johns told CTV News.

After calling police, Johns carried the foot home for safekeeping, worried that high tides might wash the foot back into the ocean or that it would attract the attention of wildlife in the area.

The find was the latest in a series that has sparked speculation around the world. Since 2007, another dozen feet have washed up in British Columbia, each of them clad in running shoes.

Some point to natural disasters, such as the 2004 tsunami, or plane or boat accidents at sea. Others theorise that the feet might be the work of a serial killer or organised crime.

At times pranksters have also sought to add fuel to the fire. “We’ve had people put dog foot skeletons in runners and leave them on the beach,” Barb McLintock of the BC coroner’s office told the Guardian the last time a foot washed up, in February 2016. “And somebody even used old chicken bones.”

In the past dozen cases, the provincial coroner’s office has ruled out foul play, noting that none of the feet showed signs of trauma. They have identified eight of the feet, saying they included two pairs, and determined that the remaining lone feet belonged to men.

All of the individuals either killed themselves or died accidentally, with their feet naturally coming apart from their bodies during decomposition, said the coroner.

The ubiquitous presence of running shoes might explain some of the mystery. Made with light but durable materials, the shoes both protect the foot from decomposition and act as a flotation device that pulls it to the surface.

In the latest case, authorities are attempting to identify the foot and a cause of death. Police are scouring databases to see if there are any matches with missing persons cases and have said that foul play is not suspected at this point.



The investigation is in its early stages and could eventually be broadened, said Andy Watson of the BC coroner’s office. “It may even include working with agencies south of the border, because with the tides and the coastline this could have come from another jurisdiction too.”

Watson said he wasn’t sure why the number of feet found in British Columbia had climbed into double digits in recent years. “I don’t really have a succinct reason as to why that is,” he said. “You know, you look at the sheer nature of the geography and how big the coastline is.”",mainstream
1150,"Ancient Aliens Are Racist and Other Lefty Insanity

If you’ve watched The History Channel, you know that “ancient aliens” probably built the Pyramids and Stonehenge and maybe the Hanging Gardens of Babylon (and why wouldn’t little green men have little green thumbs?)

Of course, if you watch The History Channel, you also know that Adolf Hitler may have escaped Germany via U-boat and was spotted 1950 working as a volunteer starter at a Venezuelan golf course. At the long-abandoned Lebensraum Country Club, researchers have found SS-logo tees and a novelty mug reading, “A Bad Day on the Fairway Beats a Good Day in the Bunker.”

You may also be aware that Bigfoot guards pirates’ treasure at the bottom of a bottomless well on Oak Island. And that finding a saddle bolt from a 1916 Indian motorcycle beneath a pile of rat droppings turns on the American Pickers guys in ways that don’t seem quite wholesome.

In short, not much you see on the History Channel these days is worth spit as history, and the History Channel is about the only place you see this garbage. So why would academics spend time developing theories about (and liberal magazines devote pages to) ancient aliens? Because (wait for it!) racism.

On the site Hyperallergic, author Sarah E. Bond tells readers that recent archeological discoveries are more proof against the “long-held but fringe theory that the blocks were so heavy and the distances they would have to travel so lengthy that aliens must have built the pyramids.” She then goes on to devote more than 2,000 words to the “fringe theory.”

653,"Payroll is a hidden downhill-only trail just off Deer Valley Ski Resort. It’s rated as a black diamond and drops about 450 vertical feet in less than a mile. The access point is easy to miss, as you’re bombing down T&G trail, so it’s one of the best-kept secrets in town. If you can find it, Payroll delivers one of the premier singletrack descents among Park City’s 500-mile network. This is where I went to test a custom-built Trek Stache 29+ hardtail ($1,730 frameset only).

I’d never ridden a “plus bike” prior to the Stache, which makes me a late adopter of this mountain biking trend. More commonly, these extra-fat-tire bikes have 27.5-inch wheels. So they end up riding like a 29er due to the extra girth of a 3.0-inch tire. However, when you mount one of these beefy treads on a 29-inch rim, the total circumference is comically large. There’s just so much rubber. And that’s really the point.

Payroll is designed as a narrow flow trail with two sets of double jumps, a couple drop-offs and a series of tight berms. But it’s not rocky or rooted. The Stache is designed with a dramatically sloping top tube and a high head tube. So when you drop the saddle all the way down, it rides like a BMX bike with monster-truck tires. Which makes the Stache and Payroll trail an ideal combination.

The added tire volume lets you run pressure below 20 psi. As such, the tires offer a bit of cushion-like suspension and a metric ton of grip. My biggest challenge was getting off the brakes because this bike can carry so much more speed into and through turns; it’s just a matter of leaning it past the point where little 2.5-inch tires would break free. When it comes to rocks, roots, sand or mud, the Stache floats on top of everything. It’s like a powder ski with a 120mm waist: too fat to sink in and get bogged down.

The Stache initially caught my attention because the trails in Park City tend to be pretty smooth and flowy. It’s perfectly designed for trail bikes with 130mm of travel, but you can get away with less. The trails are also very fast. Whether climbing, descending or riding the flats, you carry a lot of momentum. As with the Specialized Epic HT, riding a hardtail offers a unique trail experience. And I figured the Stache would offer that same feel on steroids.

Rather than ride the stock build, which is largely assembled with Trek’s in-house components, I wanted to push the performance envelope by going higher end. The key decision, of course, was the wheelset and tires. But first I had to pick a drivetrain. Coming off the success of reviewing Shimano’s new XTR group, it was an easy choice. The key difference is that the Stache is better suited to the wide range cassette (11-51t) and the long cage rear derailleur for easier climbing. From there, I opted for Shimano’s new XTR hubs, which are the source of the new Micro Spline freehub standard. The next question: how to lace them up?

One of the themes of this Stache build is that everything needs to be burly. This isn’t an XC hardtail, nor is it a bike for Strava PRs. It’s a hardtail that you punish like a full-suspension bike for the pure fun of it (with the added benefit of efficient climbing out of the saddle). It has to hold up to serious abuse. Still, I didn’t want to weigh it down. The wheel choice, then, was pretty clear. I sent the XTR hubs to ENVE to be built with its M640 hoops. The M6 series is designed for trail use, and with an internal width of 40mm, the 640s support tires ranging from 2.8 to 3.2 inches. Altogether, the set weighs about 1,700 grams, and each tire weighs about 900 grams.

It should be noted that I bottommed the rear tire on the rim on pretty much every ride — often making a loud ping! noise — but never flatted or compromised the rim in any way. Apparently, this is something you have to get used to with a plus bike in order to get the most out of it.

In keeping with the burly theme, the crankset, bottom bracket and cockpit are all from RaceFace. In fact, this same set of Next SL cranks and Cinch power meter spindle were ridden on my Breck Epic race bike; so they can certainly withstand abuse. The only difference is that these have a 32t, Shimano-12-speed-compatible chainring.

The cockpit features a RaceFace Next 35 10mm rise carbon handlebar with a Turbine R 35 aluminum stem. This is the new bar-stem standard (35mm) that increases strength with a wider diameter clamp area but reduces weight by shaving material. And since the Stache already has a high head tube, I didn’t need much rise from the bar itself. The Turbine R dropper post features the same construction and internals as the Fox Transfer minus the Kashima Coat. While the Kashima is smoother and faster, the actual performance difference from a dropper post is small compared to that of a shock that is constantly cycling. And the Turbine R’s black finish goes better with this build. That said, I prefer the lower profile Fox Transfer lever to the larger RaceFace version.

Front suspension options for the Stache are pretty limited. This is the new 2020 RockShox Pike Ultimate with 120mm of travel. Although the posted specs limit the 29-inch tire width to 2.8 inches, the 3.0 WTB Rangers clear the fork with plenty of room to spare. RockShox reduced stiction on this updated model with new wiper seals and damping fluid, allowing the fork to cycle faster through stutter bumps. The Charger 2.1 RC2 damper is simple to setup with psi, rebound control and high/low speed compression offering four tuning variables. With a 3.0-inch tire, its 120mm feels more like 140mm.

SRAM’s new 2020 G2 Ultimate disc brakes slot in just below its top-of-the-line Code models. Like all SRAM brakes, they are easy to setup and adjust. Given the aggressive setup of this Stache, though, I didn’t feel they had enough bite. When coming off of other bikes with higher-performing brakes, I found that I needed to adapt to the G2s by braking harder and earlier. It could also be that these huge (heavy) wheels are just harder to slow down. I may try a different set of pads, but my sense is that these are better suited to recreational trail riding as opposed to bombing Payroll with more tire grip than I can fully utilize.

Other component choices include the Selle SMP 209 saddle and Chris King NoThreadset headset. When all was assembled, it tipped the scale at 26.5 pounds, which is right in line with a high-end trail bike.

There’s no question: the Trek Stache is a blast to ride. It’s fun because it harks back to why we started riding in the first place...namely, for fun. It’s reminiscent of those early ‘90s front-suspension hardtails — like my trusty Yeti ARC with a RockShox Mag 21 — but the exaggerated tires and modern technology make it feel right at home on today’s black-diamond flow trails. Plus, it doesn’t fit into any of today’s bike category boxes; it’s a one-of-a-kind design and riding experience.

The only challenge for me, personally, is that I tended to ding my right ankle on the raised chainstay when giving it too much English or getting bounced around on rocky sections. This is because it’s right at the level of my back foot in descending position. I spaced out the bottom bracket and pedal a bit, which helped, but it didn’t fully solve the problem. I suppose an ankle pad would be an option for a long-term fix.",mainstream
843,"It is good news, however, for manufacturers of traffic cones: when the contraflow is in its pomp, some 8,000 cones will be in place to guide drivers on to the wrong side of the carriageway and back again. Janice Dean, sales manager at Swintex, Britain's most prolific cone manufacturer, can't say for sure whether any of its product forms part of the record-breaking roadworks, because the cones are supplied to contractors through distributors well in advance. She has, however, noticed a recent sales surge.

""We have been absolutely inundated with orders for one-metre Bigfoot cones,"" says Dean (Bigfoot being Swintex's trade name for its two-piece European-standard motorway traffic cone, pre-fitted with a starlux reflect-ive sleeve). According to Dean the Bigfoot is practically synonymous with contraflow formation. ""To be honest, you know when people call a vacuum cleaner a Hoover? People call any two-piece cone a Bigfoot.""

In the two-piece model, first developed in 1984, the pointy bit is manufactured from ""flow-moulded virgin material"", while the base is made from compression-moulded, recycled material. ""That's designed so that when it's hit it will come apart,"" says Dean, ""which is safer for the motorist.""

She reckons UK manufacturers produce about 160,000 cones every year, so a contract for 8,000 may sound like a drop in the bucket, but the M5 contraflow is going to be in place for nine months, and a lot of cones will need replacing in that time. ""You can't really estimate the life of a cone,"" says Dean. ""There are some Bigfoot cones that have been around for about five or six years, but if there's a wipeout on the contraflow, then they last about five or six seconds. It just depends on the situation."" To complicate things further, a base that survives a direct hit may well be mated with a new top, or vice versa, making the provenance of a given cone ultimately indeterminable.

Despite the cone's notorious reputation for restricting the free flow of traffic in the cause of absolutely nothing, Dean insists she doesn't suffer by association. Do people never accuse the cone-sellers of being merchants of evil? ""Not really,"" she says. ""Normally they think we're all millionaires"".",mainstream

1148,"The latest Wikileaks dump is said to be the “biggest exposure of CIA spying secrets ever”. It reveals how the agency hacks into consumer products to turn them into spying devices … and how it can even remotely take control of cars.

Entitled Vault 7: CIA Hacking Tools Revealed, the latest Wikileaks dump contains tons of documents explaining how the CIA has hundreds of zero-day exploits (holes in software that are unknown to the vendor) and can hack almost any smart tv, Android phone, iPhone, or router, and, apparently, recent cars as well. Not only that, the agency can even leave the “footprint” of another entity while doing the hacking, effectively allowing them to put the blame on a foreign nation or organization. The documents state:

The CIA, working with British spy agency MI5, have developed a back door for a smart TV that allows government snooping while the television is turned off. And that may now include live video streaming of your living room and office. In a 2014 document detailing future and improvements to the program, CIA officials said they planned to add a feature where the Agency could capture video and video snapshots of people through their televisions. This would put the federal government and the CIA right in your family room and office.

Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized “zero day” exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.

According to the documents, the CIA has been using the State Department consulate in Frankfurt Germany as a headquarters for hackers in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

The organization has been collecting a library of attack techniques from malware produced in other states, including Russia. The CIA has the ability to use this library to misdirect attribution of hacks by leaving behind the “fingerprints” of stolen malware.

Probably the most startling portion of this dump is the revelation that the CIA has gained the ability to “hack” into recent cars through their control systems. Note that we are not even talking about self-driving cars (which will certainly become 100% CIA-remote-controlled), but regular cars with computerized components (around 2011 and earlier). Why would they want to do that? To “engage in nearly undetectable assassinations”.

These revelations shed a new light on the very mysterious death of journalist Michael Hastings, who lost his life after his car suddenly went out of control and crashed.

Hastings was a journalist, a contributing editor to Rolling Stone and reporter for BuzzFeed. He became a vocal critic of the surveillance state during the investigation of reporters by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2013, referring to the restrictions on the freedom of the press by the Obama administration as a “war” on journalism. His last story, “Why Democrats Love to Spy On Americans”, was published by BuzzFeed on June 7. Hastings died in a fiery high-speed automobile crash on June 18, 2013, in Los Angeles, California.

On June 18, 2013, Hastings died in a single vehicle automobile crash in his Mercedes C250 Coupé at approximately 4:25 a.m. in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. A witness to the crash said the car seemed to be traveling at maximum speed and was creating sparks and flames before it fishtailed and crashed into a palm tree. Video from a nearby security camera purportedly shows Hastings’ vehicle speeding and bursting into flames. Witnesses described the car’s engine being ejected 50 to 60 yards (46–55 m) from the scene. Hastings’ body was burned beyond recognition. The coroner identified the body by matching fingerprints with those the FBI had on file. Two days after the crash, the Los Angeles Police Department declared that there were no signs of foul play. The coroner’s report ruled the death to be an accident. An autopsy showed that the cause of death was massive blunt force trauma consistent with a high-speed crash.

 – Los Angeles Times, “Michael Hastings death: New video of crash emerges”

A news article from 2015 actually mentioned that Hasting’s death was most like the result of a “car cyber attack”.

Former U.S. National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism Richard A. Clarke said that what is known about the crash is “consistent with a car cyber attack”. He was quoted as saying “There is reason to believe that intelligence agencies for major powers — including the United States — know how to remotely seize control of a car. So if there were a cyber attack on [Hastings’] car — and I’m not saying there was, I think whoever did it would probably get away with it.” “Hastings’ work as a thorn in the side of government and the 33-year-old journalist’s death in an unusual crash in June 2013 immediately triggered speculation. A witness reported seeing Hastings’ new silver Mercedes C250 coupe speeding down a Hollywood street before dawn when it bounced, slammed into a tree and burst into flames. Shortly before Hastings’ death, he sent what was described as a “panicky” email to friends expressing concern that associates were being interviewed by “the Feds.” He also wrote that he was onto a big story and needed to “get off the radar for a bit.” His 2010 story for Rolling Stone in which Stanley McChrystal skewered the White House and its strategy in Afghanistan led to the general’s resignation. The FBI denied Hastings was the target of any investigation, yet a Freedom of Information Act request later unearthed an FBI file on Hastings. Hastings also told a neighbor he thought someone had been tampering with his car. At the time of his death, he was working on an article about CIA director John Brennan.

 – Who.What.Why, “CAR HACKING REPORT REFUELS CONCERNS ABOUT MICHAEL HASTINGS CRASH”

According to several sources, Hasting’s last days very hectic.

“In an email to colleagues, which was copied to and released by Hastings’ friend, Army Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, Hastings said that he was “onto a big story”, that he needed to “go off the radar”, and that the FBI might interview them. WikiLeaks announced that Hastings had also contacted Jennifer Robinson, one of its lawyers, a few hours prior to the crash, and the LA Weekly reported that he was preparing new reports on the CIA at the time of his death. His widow Elise Jordan said his final story was a profile of CIA Director John O. Brennan. The FBI released a statement denying that Hastings was being investigated. USA Today reported that in the days before his death, Hastings believed his car was being “tampered with” and that he was scared and wanted to leave town. ‘At 12:30 a.m. on the morning he died, an agitated Michael Hastings went to his neighbor and friend Jordanna Thigpen and asked to borrow her car. He said he was afraid to drive his own car, because he believed that someone had been tampering with it. “He was scared, and he wanted to leave town,” Thigpen recalls. But she declined, saying her car was having mechanical problems. When she woke up, Hastings was dead, his car having crashed into a tree.’ Hastings died in a single vehicle automobile crash in his Mercedes C250 Coupé at approximately 4:25 a.m. in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.

871,"Athlete's foot (tinea pedis) is a fungal infection that usually begins between the toes. It commonly occurs in people whose feet have become very sweaty while confined within tightfitting shoes.

Signs and symptoms of athlete's foot include a scaly rash that usually causes itching, stinging and burning. Athlete's foot is contagious and can be spread via contaminated floors, towels or clothing.

Athlete's foot is closely related to other fungal infections such as ringworm and jock itch. It can be treated with over-the-counter antifungal medications, but the infection often recurs. Prescription medications also are available.

Athlete's foot usually causes a scaly red rash. The rash typically begins in between the toes. Itching is often the worst right after you take off your shoes and socks.

Some types of athlete's foot feature blisters or ulcers. The moccasin variety of athlete's foot causes chronic dryness and scaling on the soles that extends up the side of the foot. It can be mistaken for eczema or dry skin.

The infection can affect one or both feet and can spread to your hand — especially if you scratch or pick at the infected parts of your feet.

When to see a doctor

If you have a rash on your foot that doesn't improve within two weeks of beginning self-treatment with an over-the-counter antifungal product, see your doctor.

If you have diabetes, see your doctor if you suspect you have athlete's foot, especially if you notice any signs of a possible secondary bacterial infection such as excessive redness, swelling, drainage or fever.

Athlete's foot is caused by the same type of fungus that causes ringworm and jock itch. Damp socks and shoes and warm, humid conditions favor the organisms' growth.

Athlete's foot is contagious and can be spread by contact with an infected person or from contact with contaminated surfaces, such as towels, floors and shoes.

You are at higher risk of athlete's foot if you:
• Share mats, rugs, bed linens, clothes or shoes with someone who has a fungal infection
• Walk barefoot in public areas where the infection can spread, such as locker rooms, saunas, swimming pools, communal baths and showers

Your athlete's foot infection can spread to other parts of your body, including:
• Your hand. People who scratch or pick at the infected parts of their feet may develop a similar infection in one of their hands.
• Your nails. The fungi associated with athlete's foot can also infect your toenails, a location that tends to be more resistant to treatment.
• Your groin. Jock itch is often caused by the same fungus that results in athlete's foot. It's common for the infection to spread from the feet to the groin as the fungus can travel on your hands or on a towel.

These tips can help you avoid athlete's foot or ease the symptoms if infection occurs:
• Keep your feet dry, especially between your toes. Go barefoot to let your feet air out as much as possible when you're home. Dry between your toes after a bath or shower.
• Change socks regularly. If your feet get very sweaty, change your socks twice a day.
• Wear light, well-ventilated shoes. Avoid shoes made of synthetic material, such as vinyl or rubber.
• Alternate pairs of shoes. Don't wear the same pair every day so that you give your shoes time to dry after each use.
• Protect your feet in public places. Wear waterproof sandals or shoes around public pools, showers and lockers rooms.
• Treat your feet. Use powder, preferably antifungal, on your feet daily.",mainstream
1215,"Hiking couple claim new footage shows Bigfoot out for a walk in the wilds of Canada 



Eerie footage shot in the Canadian wilderness has set off speculation that the mystery figure filmed in the distance could be the legendary Bigfoot. 



The startling video allegedly shot by a couple hiking in Mission, British Columbia, shows a large, gangling figure covered in hair, lumbering over a forest hilltop. 



As always with these kinds of sightings, the clip is very blurry, but from what the viewer can make out the figure emerges from a tree and is visible for around 20 seconds - before appearing to punch a few leaves out of the way before disappearing out of sight.

For more videos, please go to

The silent video has been viewed over 50,000 times since it was uploaded onto YouTube on Wednesday - however it is not clear when exactly the clip was filmed. 



According to Crypto-zoology website 'Legend Tracker', the couple were on a hiking holiday when they spotted the mythic creature in the distance and began to film.

The tantalizing footage has left Bigfoot believers hoping that experts can examine it and therefore prove that the legendary ape-like Sasquatch does indeed live in the forests of North America. 



At the beginning of July, the claims of Texas veterinarian Melba Ketchum's that she had proved the existence of Sasquatch with DNA evidence were refuted.

The 'sample' she said proved the existence of Bigfoot turned out to contain mostly opossum DNA, mixed in with markers from other animals, according to tests. 



Houston Chronicle science reporter Eric Berger says there is no evidence that any of the DNA in the sample belongs to a Sasquatch or any other hominid cousins of humans. 



When Ketchum released her 'scientific study' of Big Foot earlier this year, Berger hammered her for not submitting the paper to a credible peer-reviewed journal and not allowing mainstream researchers to verify her work. 



Instead, she launched a journal of her own, the DeNovo Scientific Journal, and published her findings online and charged $30 to read the work.

'If Ketchum really had the goods she would have co-authored the paper with reputable scientists and gotten the work published in a reputable scientific journal,' Berger wrote in February. 



'Instead she’s playing to an audience that doesn’t understand how science works, that wants to believe Bigfoot exists and is willing to send her some cash to further their delusions.' 



However, Ketchum approached Berger and offered him definitive proof of her findings - she would let his friend, a top Houston geneticist, take a sample of her Big Foot DNA and test it himself. 



Ketchum claims the sample came from a family of ten Sasquatches that lives in northern Michigan. She says the sample was taken from the crumbs left behind after the Bigfoots ate blueberry bagels. 



Berger admits he allowed himself to get momentarily excited by the prospect of testing Sasquatch DNA. 



'If the evidence backed up Ketchum’s claims, I had a blockbuster story. My geneticist source would have a hand in making the scientific discovery of the decade, or perhaps the century. Ketchum would be vindicated,' he wrote. 



Instead, he says, rational science came crashing down. The sample contained nothing more than the remnants left behind by common forest animals.",mainstream

1067,"A congressional race in Virginia's Fifth District has taken a bizarre twist as Democratic candidate Leslie Cockburn accused her Republican opponent, Denver Riggleman, of being a devotee of ""Bigfoot erotica"" over the weekend.

Cockburn pointed out Riggleman's apparent passion for the myth of Bigfoot in a tweet, which has now gone viral thanks to her accusation and Riggleman's interview with Matt Kibbe on CRTV, a right-wing outlet .

Cockburn tweeted a screengrab of what appears to be Riggleman's Instagram account showing a lewd picture of Bigfoot on Sunday. ""This is not what we need on Capitol Hill,"" she wrote.

In his interview with CRTV, Riggleman says he is ""skeptical"" Bigfoot exists, but he describes elaborate theories about the legendary monster, telling Kibbe, “Bigfoot can attack you with infrasound, like an elephant — I just want to let you know — or psychic terror vibes, to make you run through the woods and crash into a tree so they can drag you into the woods and create baby Bigfoots.”

Riggleman, an Air Force veteran and businessman turned Congressional candidate, also self-published a book about Bigfoot titled The Mating Habits of Bigfoot and Why Women Want Him , the Washington Post reports . He wrote an earlier book about Bigfoot called Bigfoot Exterminators, Inc.: The Partially Cautionary, Mostly True Tale of Monster Hunt 2006 with an ESPN writer more than a decade ago.

The Republican congressional candidate has not shied away from the issue however, acknowledging his passion for the creature with a tweet responding to Cockburn's accusations, as well as giving interviews to major media outlets like the New York Times .

While it's unclear how Virginia feels about experimenting with Bigfoot believers, the internet is having a field day with ""Bigfoot erotica."" The Washington Post and Rolling Stone have pointed out that Bigfoot erotica and monster erotica are genres that are in fact available on Amazon, mostly in the form of self-published fan fiction.

560,"Russia intends to spend more than $200 million (or 162 million euros) to make sure stadiums built for the World Cup do not go to waste after the showpiece ends.

The hosts are trying to use the football final to revive fan interest in the struggling domestic leagues.

Each of the 11 host cities is either getting a brand new arena or having an existing one refurbished from the ground up.

The idea is to replace cavernous all-purpose stadiums in which supporters are exposed to the sun and snow with modern ones outfitted with the latest amenities.

Vladimir Putin issued an order last October requiring his government to draft a World Cup ""legacy"" programme that raises club-match attendance and boosts youth player development.

But the question long facing Russia has been how to reap rewards from the massive investment in cities where local clubs play second-tier football.

The cabinet's proposal reported by state media on Tuesday admits that the government will have to foot the bill in some places until 2023.

""Keeping in mind the high cost of stadium operations and the low expected football club revenues, it is impossible to expect stadium use to be commercially viable in the next 3-5 years,"" the government programme says.

The RIA Novosti state news agency said the government wants to assign 16.6 billion rubles ($265 million) to the legacy programme.

Most of that money -- $190 million -- will come from the federal budget and be assigned to keeping stadiums open in seven of the smaller host cities.

Some of the money will also be spent on training facilities and youth football centres.

Russia admits that it will not turn a profit as host.

But it views the international football extravaganza as a chance to make a long-term investment in a game that has struggled since Soviet times.

It also dearly wants to avoid getting stuck with white elephants, stadiums built for major events that turn into abandoned symbols of mismanagement and excess.

The problem has most recently attracted attention after the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Brazil.",mainstream,M0c6b9,big.foot
599,"JPMorgan Is Selling The Building That Houses Its Gold Vault

On the surface, there is nothing spectacular about the weekend news that JPMorgan is seeking to sell its 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza office building. After all, the former headquarters of Chase Manhattan Bank, located deep in the heart of the financial district and which was built by its then chairman David Rockefeller, is a remnant to another time – a time when banking was about providing loans, not about managing and trading assets which has become the realm of Midtown New York, and since JPM already has extensive Midtown exposure with its offices at 270, 270 and 245 Park, the 1 CMP building always stood out as a bit of a sore thumb. Of course, as Zero Hedge readers first learned, the big surprise is literally below the surface, some 90 feet below street level to be exact, where the formerly secret JPM gold vault is located, which also happens to be the biggest commercial gold vault in the world.

It was only a month ago when we learned that JPM was planning to exit the physical commodity business, and today we know that the firm is set on disposing of its one crowning asset in the commercial gold vaulting industry. This begs the question: is JPM set to fully and completely exit the precious metals vertical which it inherited when it was handed Bear Stearns on a $10 platter (together with the now defunct firm’s legacy short positions)? If so, is it also in the process of unwinding any and all legacy precious metals exposure including rumored “whale-sized” shorts in the paper silver and/or gold axes, and what happens to the price of silver and gold when a massive stock position becomes “flow” in the other direction (i.e., short covering)?

Finally, if indeed JPM is getting out dodge, is there some hope that a semblance of normalcy will return to a market best known for the AM-PM closing fix arbitrage, as well as the occasional bid stack take out slam and close (and open) banging? Or, will the buyer of the building, and vault, be none other than the Federal Reserve, which will merely take this opportunity to merge its own, and the world’s largest commercial gold vaults, which just happen to be located next to each other and connected by tunnel deep below the ironically named Liberty Street?

Inquiring minds certainly want to know.

More from Bloomberg on the sale process:

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) is seeking to sell 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, the lower Manhattan tower built by David Rockefeller in the late 1950s, as the company reduces its office space in the city. The bank would relocate about 4,000 employees, most of the people who work in the 60-story skyscraper, to other New York locations, said Brian Marchiony, a spokesman. JPMorgan occupies about half of the space in 2.2 million-square-foot (204,000-square-meter) building, according to CoStar Group Inc. (CSGP), a Washington-based firm that follows office leasing. The building may fetch at least $600 million, according to a person with knowledge of the offering. The cost to buyers would be higher because they would assume any conversion expenses, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. An offering of the tower, a city landmark designed by architect Gordon Bunshaft, would test the downtown office market. Shrinking financial companies have left lower Manhattan landlords with at least 6.3 million square feet of space to fill, according to data from brokerage Newmark Knight Frank Grubb. The tower may achieve its highest value as a mixed-use property, with a hotel, additional retail or apartments added, said Dan Fasulo, managing director of Real Capital Analytics Inc., a New York-based research firm that tracks commercial real estate sales. “You could do a department store in the base,” he said. “It’s a very exciting potential mixed-use opportunity, in my mind. I think the market will receive it very well.”

And the vault in the basement, “longer than a football field,” would become a restaurant or a paintball arena?

For those who missed it, here is the excerpt from the exclusive Zero Hedge expose shining some light on the world’s biggest and now supposedly almost empty, commercial gold vault.

From: Why Is JPMorgan’s Gold Vault, The Largest In The World, Located Next To The New York Fed’s?

Curiously (or perhaps not at all), when the CME on behalf of JPM submitted the certification filing alongside the comparable such supplements as filed by Brinks above, it requested a FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) confidential treatment. As a reminder, to be eligible for FOIA exemption status the protected information must be of vital importance to the nation’s safety. This is precisely what JPM thought the details surrounding its New York vault are. To wit:

Pursuant to Sections 8 and 8(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), as amended, and Commission Regulation 145.9(d), NYMEX and COMEX request confidential treatment of Appendix A, Appendix B, and this letter on the grounds that disclosure of Appendix A and/or Appendix B would reveal confidential commercial information of the submitters (NYMEX and COMEX) and of other persons. Pursuant to Commission Regulation 145.9(d)(5), NYMEX and COMEX request that confidential treatment be maintained for Appendix A and Appendix B until further notice from the Exchanges. We also request that the Commission notify the undersigned immediately after receiving any FOIA request for said Appendix A, Appendix B or any other court order, subpoena or summons for same. Finally, we request that we be notified in the event the Commission intends to disclose such Appendix A and/or Appendix B to Congress or to any other governmental agency or unit pursuant to Section 8 of the CEA. NYMEX and COMEX do not waive their notification rights under Section 8(f) of the CEA with respect to any subpoena or summons for such Appendix A or Appendix B. Please contact the undersigned at (212) 299-2207 should you have any questions concerning this letter.

Yet oddly enough, the FOIA request letter itself, while also being filed with a request for Confidential Treatment, never got it. As a result it was posted at this address. Ooops.

But a far bigger oops, is that on the first page of said declassified confidential FOIA app, in black ink, we get the missing piece:

And so, despite the extended attempts at secrecy, we finally hit the proverbial goldmine vault.

So what do we know about 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza. Well, aside from the fact that the 60-story structure, built in the 1950s, was the headquarters of the once-legendary Chase Manhattan corporation, and which when it was built was the world’s sixth tallest building, not much.

So we set off to learn more.

To learn more, we first went to the motherlode: the Landmarks Preservation Commission, whose report on 1 CMP describes everyone one wants to know about this building and then much more, such as that:

So the old Chase HQ, once the stomping grounds of one David Rockefeller, and soon to be the other half of JPMorgan Chase, has 5 sub-basements, just like the NY Fed…

Or, about the same depth as the bottom-most sub-basement under the NY Fed…

But then we hit the jackpot:

And there you have it: the JPM vault, recommissioned to become a commercial vault, just happens to also be the “world’s largest bank vault.”

Digging some more into the curious nature of this biggest bank vault in the world, we learn the following, courtesy of a freely available book written by one of the architects:

In other words, the world’s biggest bank vault, that belonging to the private Chase Manhattan empire, and then, to JPMorgan, was so safe, the creators even had a plan of action should it sustain a near-direct hit from a nuclear bomb, and suffer epic flooding (such as that from Hurricane Sandy).

It is no surprise, then, that the street entrance to this world’s biggest vault located under 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza makes the entrance to any medieval impregnable fortress seem like child’s play in comparison. Courtesy of Google StreetView:

Yet it is not what is on this side of the street, which just happens to be known as Liberty Street, that is what is the most interesting part of this whole story. It is what is on the other:

That’s right, ladies and gentlemen, as a result of our cursory examination, we have learned that the world’s largest private, and commercial, gold vault, that belonging once upon a time to Chase Manhattan, and now to JPMorgan Chase, is located, right across the street, and at the same level underground, resting just on top of the Manhattan bedrock, as the vault belonging to the New York Federal Reserve, which according to folklore is the official location of the biggest collection of sovereign, public gold in the world.

At this point we would hate to be self-referential, and point out what one of our own commentators noted on the topic of the Fed’s vault a year ago, namely that:

… but we won’t, and instead we will let readers make up their own mind why the the thousands of tons of sovereign gold in the possession of the New York Fed, have to be literally inches across, if not directly connected, to the largest private gold vault in the world.

We think readers can do a good enough job on their own.

1141,"* Williams says Fed should take pre-emptive measures

* Dollar blips up after NY Fed says Williams comments academic

* Sterling jumps back but still worst performer this week

TOKYO, July 19 (Reuters) - The dollar steadied on Friday but was still on the defensive after Federal Reserve officials bolstered expectations of an aggressive rate cut this month to address weakening price pressures.

At a central banking conference on Thursday, New York Fed President John Williams argued for pre-emptive measures to avoid having to deal with too low inflation and interest rates.

That sent the dollar down before it bounced slightly in early Asian trade, after a New York Fed representative subsequently said Williams’ comments were academic and not about immediate policy direction.

Still, investors took his remarks along with separate comments from Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida as another dovish signal from the central bank, which could be opening the way for a big rate cut at the end of this month.

The dollar stood at 107.42 yen, up 0.2% from late U.S. levels after having hit a three-week low of 107.21 the previous day.

The euro eased slightly to $1.1266 from $1.1282. On the week, the dollar is down 0.4% versus the yen and 0.1% on the euro.

The dollar index, which hit a two-week low of 96.648, bounced to 96.792.

The greenback fell broadly on Thursday after Williams’ remarks bolstered bets that the Fed would cut interest rates by 50 basis points, rather than 25 basis points.

Williams said when rates and inflation are low, policymakers cannot afford to keep their “powder dry” and wait for potential economic problems to materialise.

That is especially true with neutral rates that would neither restrict nor accelerate the U.S. economy, he said. When adjusted for inflation, the neutral rate is near the Fed’s current policy rate, which is in a range of 2.25-2.50%.

Financial markets reacted quickly, with money market futures pricing in almost a 70% chance of a 50 basis point cut at its policy meeting on July 30-31 at one point.

The odds eased to around 40% after the New York Fed’s clarification of his speech.

All the same, Williams’ rate-cut view was echoed by Fed Vice Chair Clarida, who told Fox Business Network the central bank might have to act early and not wait “until things get so bad”.

“Williams’ comments were surprisingly dovish. The NY Fed went all the way to try to modify the message but no one seems to have done so for Clarida, who also said a very similar thing,” said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank.

The dollar’s weakness also underpinned many emerging market currencies.

MSCI’s emerging market currency index has risen 0.35% so far this week to a four-month high of 1,657.07, coming within sight of this year’s double peak around 1,658, hit in late January and March.

The Brazilian real rose to five-month high of 3.7172 to the dollar on Thursday while the South African rand also scaled a five-month peak of 13.8175 and last stood at 13.855.

“If the Fed cut rates, that could encourage fresh investments in emerging currencies and other risk assets,” said Bart Wakabayashi, State Street Bank’s representative in Japan.

Elsewhere, the pound remained firm following stronger-than-expected UK retail sales numbers and after British lawmakers on Thursday approved proposals to make it harder for the next prime minister to force through a no-deal Brexit by suspending parliament.

The pound stood at $1.2552, flat in Asia after 0.93% gains overnight, though it was the worst performer among G10 currencies so far this week, with a loss of 0.2%.

The biggest stride was made by the New Zealand dollar, which is up 1.3% for the week at a 3-1/2-month high of $0.6785 , as the Fed’s anticipated monetary easing is seen boosting the relative yield attraction of the kiwi.

1072,"A mystery creature is haunting the streets of Texas. Described by some terrified witnesses as a monkey, by others as a chimpanzee and as “anything’s possible” by police, a sense of apprehension is spreading.

The unidentified humanoid has been repeatedly spotted in the city of Santa Fe, with one witness claiming they saw the beast attempt to snatch a cat.

The alarm was first raised in the early hours of Monday, when a woman named Patricia de la Mora called the police to say she had seen some kind of primate causing pandemonium on the corner of 24th and East Bellaire streets in the south west of the city.

She had apparently been woken up after midnight by thunder and lightning, and after urging her husband to look out of the window when she heard “strange noises”, eventually got out of bed herself, opened the curtains and was “paralysed by fear”.

“I look out the window and I see it was in there. It was a monkey, a big one,” she told US news outlet KVUE.

Ms de la Mora said she did not have time to get her phone, but stood at her bedroom window stunned by what she saw.

“He tried to find something,” she said. “He looked over there, then he looked over there, and I closed the curtain. I didn’t want him to see me.”

But when police arrived the creature had vanished, and despite an hour-long search, all trace of the supposed animal had also evaporated.

However, the enigmatic agitator soon struck again.

The following day, police received a similar report from the same part of town, from a woman who claimed she spent 20 minutes hiding in her car.

Local news station KHOU-TV, quoted the woman as saying on Facebook: “Just had a monkey try to attack me, while checking my mail. I’ve spent the last 20 minutes in my car.”

Police again launched a futile search for any physical manifestation of the supposed monkey's existence.

Several residents in the area then reported on social media they had seen a monkey, with one person claiming the creature had tried to kidnap their cat, and another saying a child has also been “attacked”.

Police have said they cannot confirm any of the sightings but acknowledged they could well be true.

TV reporters have been sent to the area.

“Certified primate teams are out here, right now, in the Santa Fe area,” Fox News reported.

“Law enforcement actually flew drones around the area, but we’re told no monkey was spotted,” Natalie Hee, Fox’s reporter on the ground, told viewers.

Bayou Animal Services which deals with animal control in the area was unable to provide any further insight into the veracity of the claims.

They said: “We have two reports that seem legitimate. However, no visual proof from any authorities. No pictures. No videos.”

“We will continue to treat this as a serious matter unless confirmed otherwise for [the] safety of the residents in the area.”

The service also issued a checklist for how citizens should respond if they encounter the creature:
• Do not approach, chase or try and catch a primate if you have sighted said loose monkey.
• Take a picture and call animal control ASAP. The picture is to verify what type of monkey this is. Knowing the type will keep this monkey safe if it needs to be tranquilised.
• Do not go searching for the monkey. Extra people looking for this animal is going to cause a risk of someone getting hurt.
• A team that is certified in dealing with primates is on the ground now helping us locate the animal. Do not interfere. Do not attempt to help. They are professionals and know what they are doing.
• Please do not call animal control or the police station with false statements you yourself are unable to verify. This is not helpful to the authorities or to the animal.

Greg Boody, a police spokesman, said in a statement: “I’m not saying that there is no monkey, in fact, I’m sure there is one on the loose. Out here, anything is possible.”",mainstream,M0f522,big.foot
1232,"Furious protests are threatening to undermine the Iraqi government’s plan to give international oil companies a stake in its giant oilfields in a desperate effort to increase its declining oil production and oil revenues.

In less than two weeks time, on June 29 and 30, the Iraqi Oil minister Hussain Shahristani will award service contracts to the world’s largest oil companies to develop six of Iraq’s largest oil producing fields over 20-25 years.

Senior figures within the Iraqi oil industry have denounced the deal. Fayad al-Nema, the director of the South Oil Company, which comes under the Oil Ministry and produces most of Iraq’s crude, said last weekend: “The service contracts will put the Iraqi economy in chains and shackle its independence for the next 20 years. They squander Iraq’s revenues.” Mr Nema is reported to have since been fired because of his opposition to the contracts, which he says is shared by many other officials in Iraq’s state-owned oil industry.

The government maintains that it is not compromising the ownership of Iraq’s huge oil reserves – the third in the world at 115 billion barrels – on which the country is wholly dependent to fund its recovery from 30 years of war, sanctions and occupation. But the fall in the price of oil over the last year has left the government facing a devastating financial crisis in which 80 per cent of its revenues goes to pay for salaries, food rations and recurrent costs. Almost nothing is left for reconstruction and it is finding it hard to pay even for vitally-needed items such as electrical plant from GE and Siemens.

The development of Iraq’s oil reserves is of great importance to the world’s energy supply in the 21st century. They may be even larger than Saudi Arabia’s, as there was little exploration while Iraq was ruled by Saddam Hussein. International oil companies are desperate to get their foot in the door. “Everyone wants to be in Iraq,” says Ruba Husari, an expert on Iraqi oil. “Togethor with Iran this is the only oil province in the world that has great potential. It is a great opportunity for oil companies because nobody knows the size of Iraq’s reserves. Iraq itself needs to know what is under its soil.”

But Iraqis are wary of the involvement of big foreign oil companies in raising production in super giant fields like Kirkuk and Bai Hassan in the north and Rumaila, Zubair and West Qurna in the south. They suspect that the US invasion of 2003 was ultimately aimed at securing western control of their oil wealth. The nationalization of the Iraqi oil industry by Saddam Hussein in 1972 remains popular.

The rebellion against the service contracts has been gathering pace all this week. Parliament is demanding that bidding should be delayed. MPs summoned Mr Shahristani, a nuclear scientist imprisoned and tortured under Saddam Hussein, to answer questions about the service contracts and the fall in Iraq’s oil production and exports. Jabir Khalifa Kabir, the secretary of parliament’s oil and gas committee, claims the new contracts will “chain the government with complex contractual terms” and will abort South Oil Company’s own plans to raise production. The government says the bidding must go ahead.

The new contracts are not in fact particularly favorable to the international oil companies. They are rather the outcome of the companies’ extreme eagerness to get into Iraq and the government’s attempt to obtain expertise and investment without ceding control. The companies will be paid a fee linked to first restoring and then increasing oil output. They will, however, have greater control when there is a second round of bidding for oilfields which have been discovered but not developed. Separate again is the question of exploring for new oil reserves.

Critics of the deal in parliament say that Iraq has already invested $8 billion in developing its super giant fields. But Mr Shahristani needs an investment of $50 billion over the next five or six years to raise current production from 2.5 million barrels a day of crude and he knows the money and expertise can only come from outside Iraq.

The government in Baghdad may be near broke, but Iraqis ask whose fault this is. The Oil Ministry, like much of the government, is dysfunctional when it comes to carrying out long-term projects. Mr Shahristani is blamed for poor management skills, though he eloquently defends himself by saying that when he took over the ministry in 2006 he had to cope with attacks by guerrillas who once were blowing up a pipeline every day.

This explains Mr Shahristani’s problems in northern Iraq, where the Sunni Arab insurgency of 2003-8 was strong, but not in the far south where the Shia community is dominant and there was no uprising. Jabbar al-Luaibi, the former head of the South Oil Company, who battled to maintain oil production in these years, gave a devastating interview detailing the failings of the Oil Ministry to provide the most basic equipment needed to monitor the oil reservoirs. “It’s like driving your car without any indicators on the instrument panel,” he said, adding that if mismanagement continues in the same way as in the past “who knows, we might have to start importing crude oil.”

The Iraqi government made two other mistakes for which it is now paying. It optimistically believed the price of oil would stay high at $140 a barrel. Instead of investing extra revenues by paying for outside expertise and equipment to raise production in the oilfields it spent the money on raising the pay of government employees and increasing their number. This increased Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki’s popularity in the provincial elections in January, but left the government very short of cash when oil prices collapsed. They have risen since then, but not nearly enough to solve the government’s problems.

In June 2008 the Iraqi oil industry seemed about to get foreign help by signing two year technical support contracts with major oil companies. Control would have remained with Iraq. At the last minute these were cancelled despite being supported by Mr Shahristani and the council of ministers. The reason why this happened explains much about why the Iraqi state machine is unable to carry out long term policies. Jobs are allocated to members of political parties regardless of their experience or abilities. After 2003 the Oil Ministry had been the fief of the Fadhila, a Shia Islamic party strong in Basra, and, though it left the government, it never wholly accepted Mr Shahristani as minister. Showing a certain cheek Fadhila members, having sabotaged the plan to acquire foreign expertise when money was available to buy it last year, now criticize the government for being forced to accept worse terms this year because it cannot invest itself.

It is probably too late for the Iraqi government to delay or modify the contracts to be awarded at the end of June. It needs the money too badly and it failed to invest itself when oil prices were high. Even when the big oil companies start work, it will be three years before new oil appears. Many Iraqis will be angered to see their historic oilfields, on which their country is wholly dependant, being partially run by foreign companies, but, facing an election next January, at this stage the government believes it has no choice.

289,"Big news broke last week that could change the future of closed loop technology.

OK, it's tempting to refer to this as ""Bigfoot"" news... as in Bigfoot Biomedical, the closed loop (aka Artificial Pancreas system) startup based in Milpitas, CA, led by an all-star D-Dad trio -- former JDRF leader Jeffrey Brewer, former Medtronic chief engineer Lane Desborough, and financial whiz Bryan Mazlish (Mr. ""Bigfoot"" himself) -- along with many others well-known in the Diabetes Community.

On Thursday July 13, Bigfoot announced a partnership with Abbott Diabetes Care to integrate a next-generation version of their FreeStyle Libre Flash CGM system in Bigfoot's emerging closed loop system, which could hit market by the end of 2020 if all goes according to the startup's plan.

This comes just a month or so after the news that Bigfoot bought the Timesulin insulin pen tracker -- indicating that Bigfoot's eventual closed loop system will also connect with smart insulin pens.

Whoa, quite a powerful combo there! This certainly makes Bigfoot unique in the closed loop space, being the only developer at this point with clear plans to accommodate both insulin pumpers and pen users.

Just how will all this pan out? We recently spoke with Bigfoot CEO Jeffrey Brewer to learn more about the latest developments.

As a reminder, the Abbott FreeStyle Libre is a new type of glucose monitor referred to as a Flash Glucose Monitoring (FGM) system. It consists of a small round quarter-sized sensor that's worn on the back of the arm for 14 days. Data is collected from the interstitial fluid (just like a regular CGM) every minute, but unlike a traditional CGM the user must wave a handheld receiver over the sensor to get readings -- and unlike current CGMs on the market from Dexcom and Medtronic, the first-gen Libre does not have real-time data connectivity. One major advantage is that It doesn't require any fingerstick calibration.

While not yet FDA approved for the U.S., Libre is available in 37 other countries since first coming to market internationally in 2014, and was most recently cleared in Canada. There's a body of growing clinical study data showing the Libre is accurate and effective for many PWDs.

A physician's version called Libre Pro was FDA approved in September 2016, but the patient version been before the U.S. regulatory agency since mid-2015 (!), and it's anyone's guess what the holdup is. Being able to read about European patients' experiences with Libre, American PWDs are of course anxious to get their hands on it.

But this new agreement with Bigfoot isn't about the first-generation FreeStyle Libre we'll (hopefully) see on the U.S. market very soon; it's about future technology that will go beyond the current iteration of FreeStyle Libre. Abbott's pretty hush-hush on this, so all we really know now is that the new Libre version Bigfoot plans to use will do away with the handheld scanner and will be able to share data directly with the closed loop system, making it function more like an existing CGM.

So does this mean that Bigfoot is breaking up with Dexcom, despite a partnership announced in July 2015? The anwser is yes. Bigfoot says it's been evaluating CGM partners since its inception and has now moved to Abbott exclusively. The agreement is for four years, from the start of the system's launch. This means each Bigfoot system will come with a Libre sensor, and customers will go directly through Bigfoot, not between both companies.

Why Abbott? It's all about calibrations -- or in the case of Libre, no calibrations. We're told that was a deciding factor in choosing between Dexcom and Abbott. The possibility of human error based on calibration issues was a stumbling block in designing a closed loop system that's supposed to automate care, thereby ""taking away the work"" of diabetes. While Dexcom has been pushing to drop calibrations for years, even their next-gen G6 is likely to require one calibration per day. So based on the existing Libre data worldwide, the decision to go with Abbott became pretty clear, Brewer tells us.

“In the first generation of automated systems, we think sensors that require calibration have been the crippling aspect of the user experience. We’ve learned from our own personal experiences and from what we’ve seen in data modeling, that calibration is the biggest risk to a closed loop. People don’t do it well, or consistently or even at all. And that turns out to be a big problem. Our concern is that systems that require calibration aren’t going to be as easy to use or as safe as those that don’t require it.”

Aside from adding Libre, the basics of the Bigfoot system as we've reported before haven't really changed in the past couple years. The ""Bigfoot Brain"" will be built around the former Asante Snap pump technology that Bigfoot acquired in mid-2015 using a pre-filled insulin cartridge and tubing. This is where the smart algorithm is housed, which does all the calculations for carbs, insulin delivery, etc, and a Bluetooth chip inside will talk to the Abbott Libre sensor and smartphone mobile app as the main interface.

Rather than a traditional display, it will have a ""belt-clip sized"" display with icons showing the various items such as BG data and dosing. Importantly, Brewer says the system will not have a set BG target (as Medtronic's current 670G does and others like Beta Bionics are developing). Instead, it will allow flexibility by having the system learn to adjust targets based on each individual's BG needs -- because, Your Diabetes May Vary.

As mentioned, Bigfoot will design its system for use by people on injections and multiple daily dosing, too. In early June just before the ADA Scientific Sessions, Bigfoot announced its acquisition of London-based startup Patients Pending that makes the Timesulin smart insulin pen tracker. This will allow the Libre sensor to eventually talk directly to smart pens, and transmit the data through the Bigfoot smartphone app interface.

""I don’t know why people are forced to be a pump person or a shots person. Why can’t they do both, using whatever fits their life at that point in time? Some people switch back and forth, and I think you should be able to,"" Brewer says. ""When you talk about consumerization, that’s a fancy term for just looking at the person and designing a system around their needs. That’s what Apple does, but it’s not traditionally what medical device companies do. That's what Bigfoot is doing.”

The clinical research is underway and will be the main focus for the foreseeable future:
• A clinical research study (CRC) study took place during the latter half of 2016 and wrapped up last year, and the results from that have been encouraging.
• Pivotal trials are expected to start in early 2018, and Bigfoot says it's working with FDA on what that research will look like. Once all those begin, details will be shared via ClinicalTrials.gov and the Bigfoot site itself.
• Much remains up in the air and some will be dictated by Abbott's timing, but Bigfoot hopes for approval by 2020.

The planned launch is now more than a year later than originally expected, which is disappointing -- not only for us on the consumer side, but for Bigfoot folks too. Their team of 50 people includes many living with type 1 themselves or a very personal D-connection, such as the founders being D-parents.

But Bigfoot never planned to be first -- Medtronic holds that distinction with its Minimed 670G hybrid closed loop, which got FDA approval in late 2016 and is now being slowly rolled out across the United States. They will eventually have a next-gen, more-automated model of a closed loop, and we're also expecting to see other products from Tandem and Type Zero Tech, Insulet, and Beta Bionics in the coming years. Not to mention the hundreds of (non-regulated) do-it-yourself homemade closed loop systems being used worldwide over the past couple years (including some by Bigfoot team members).

It isn't about being first, but getting it right and bringing something to market that changes the game, Brewer emphasizes.

In the past, Bigfoot has mentioned plans to adopt a monthly subscription model for this closed loop system, which they expect will cost less than combined pump/BG testing/CGM supplies cost today.

We're happy to hear that the Bigfoot team has been conscious of access and cost considerations since the start, and remain focused to making sure this can get into the hands of people who want it. No doubt, a lot will change over the next few years and we are confident Bigfoot will adapt as needed -- whether via a bundled-subscription business model (one of the most novel aspects of what Bigfoot's proposing), or changes in insurance and Medicare coverage.

Certainly, many will be surprised that Bigfoot is dropping the best-in-class Dexcom CGM for a device that's still mostly unknown in the U.S. It's odd to be asked to imagine a world of no calibrations, and to put our faith in a future product that in its first-gen offers comparatively limited data capabilities.

That's a lot to ask, especially when so many in our D-community are highly impatient and want improved technology NOW. See also: #WeAreNotWaiting.

Many also remember the FreeStyle Navigator CGM that Abbott discontinued in the U.S. back in 2011, but remains on the market internationally; it was seen as the best, better-than-Dexcom at the time and as a botched business move that it didn't succeed here in the States. Along with all the test strip recalls and customer service issues at Abbott, the company's D-tech has often been engulfed in storm clouds... but the fact remains, Abbott has some stellar technology.

For our part, we're excited to hear about this latest collaboration, and can't wait to see what materializes. In other words, the future looks bright and we continue to #BelieveInBigfoot as it moves forward with new options for better diabetes care!",mainstream,M08ff1,big.foot
721,"Gout is a common and complex form of arthritis that can affect anyone. It's characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness and tenderness in the joints, often the joint at the base of the big toe.

An attack of gout can occur suddenly, often waking you up in the middle of the night with the sensation that your big toe is on fire. The affected joint is hot, swollen and so tender that even the weight of the sheet on it may seem intolerable.

Gout symptoms may come and go, but there are ways to manage symptoms and prevent flares.

The signs and symptoms of gout almost always occur suddenly, and often at night. They include:
• Intense joint pain. Gout usually affects the large joint of your big toe, but it can occur in any joint. Other commonly affected joints include the ankles, knees, elbows, wrists and fingers. The pain is likely to be most severe within the first four to 12 hours after it begins.
• Lingering discomfort. After the most severe pain subsides, some joint discomfort may last from a few days to a few weeks. Later attacks are likely to last longer and affect more joints.
• Inflammation and redness. The affected joint or joints become swollen, tender, warm and red.
• Limited range of motion. As gout progresses, you may not be able to move your joints normally.

When to see a doctor

If you experience sudden, intense pain in a joint, call your doctor. Gout that goes untreated can lead to worsening pain and joint damage.

Seek medical care immediately if you have a fever and a joint is hot and inflamed, which can be a sign of infection.

Gout occurs when urate crystals accumulate in your joint, causing the inflammation and intense pain of a gout attack. Urate crystals can form when you have high levels of uric acid in your blood.

Your body produces uric acid when it breaks down purines — substances that are found naturally in your body.

Purines are also found in certain foods, such as steak, organ meats and seafood. Other foods also promote higher levels of uric acid, such as alcoholic beverages, especially beer, and drinks sweetened with fruit sugar (fructose).

Normally, uric acid dissolves in your blood and passes through your kidneys into your urine. But sometimes either your body produces too much uric acid or your kidneys excrete too little uric acid. When this happens, uric acid can build up, forming sharp, needlelike urate crystals in a joint or surrounding tissue that cause pain, inflammation and swelling.

You're more likely to develop gout if you have high levels of uric acid in your body. Factors that increase the uric acid level in your body include:
• Diet. Eating a diet rich in meat and seafood and drinking beverages sweetened with fruit sugar (fructose) increase levels of uric acid, which increase your risk of gout. Alcohol consumption, especially of beer, also increases the risk of gout.
• Obesity. If you're overweight, your body produces more uric acid and your kidneys have a more difficult time eliminating uric acid.
• Medical conditions. Certain diseases and conditions increase your risk of gout. These include untreated high blood pressure and chronic conditions such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and heart and kidney diseases.
• Certain medications. The use of thiazide diuretics — commonly used to treat hypertension — and low-dose aspirin also can increase uric acid levels. So can the use of anti-rejection drugs prescribed for people who have undergone an organ transplant.
• Family history of gout. If other members of your family have had gout, you're more likely to develop the disease.
• Age and sex. Gout occurs more often in men, primarily because women tend to have lower uric acid levels. After menopause, however, women's uric acid levels approach those of men. Men are also more likely to develop gout earlier — usually between the ages of 30 and 50 — whereas women generally develop signs and symptoms after menopause.
• Recent surgery or trauma. Experiencing recent surgery or trauma has been associated with an increased risk of developing a gout attack.

People with gout can develop more-severe conditions, such as:
• Recurrent gout. Some people may never experience gout signs and symptoms again. Others may experience gout several times each year. Medications may help prevent gout attacks in people with recurrent gout. If left untreated, gout can cause erosion and destruction of a joint.
• Advanced gout. Untreated gout may cause deposits of urate crystals to form under the skin in nodules called tophi (TOE-fie). Tophi can develop in several areas such as your fingers, hands, feet, elbows or Achilles tendons along the backs of your ankles. Tophi usually aren't painful, but they can become swollen and tender during gout attacks.
• Kidney stones. Urate crystals may collect in the urinary tract of people with gout, causing kidney stones. Medications can help reduce the risk of kidney stones.

During symptom-free periods, these dietary guidelines may help protect against future gout attacks:
• Drink plenty of fluids. Stay well-hydrated, including plenty of water. Limit how many sweetened beverages you drink, especially those sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup.
• Limit or avoid alcohol. Talk with your doctor about whether any amount or type of alcohol is safe for you. Recent evidence suggests that beer may be particularly likely to increase the risk of gout symptoms, especially in men.
• Get your protein from low-fat dairy products. Low-fat dairy products may actually have a protective effect against gout, so these are your best-bet protein sources.
• Limit your intake of meat, fish and poultry. A small amount may be tolerable, but pay close attention to what types — and how much — seem to cause problems for you.
• Maintain a desirable body weight. Choose portions that allow you to maintain a healthy weight. Losing weight may decrease uric acid levels in your body. But avoid fasting or rapid weight loss, since doing so may temporarily raise uric acid levels.",mainstream,M119d9,big.foot
435,"If you frequently suffer from colds, you need to do something to strengthen your immune system. Sergei Bubnovsky is a professor from Moscow who has an innovating new technique that can help you improve your immunity and overall health.

According to the professor, soaking your legs in an ice-cold bath for 10-15 seconds after coming home from work can reinforce your immune system and prepare it for the fight against colds or flu.

Also, a study from England found that taking daily cold showers increased the numbers of disease-fighting white blood cells (compared to people who took hot showers).

The investigators at Britain’s Thrombosis Research Institute suggested that as the body tries to warm itself during and after a cold shower, metabolic rate speeds up and activates the immune system, which leads to the release of more white blood cells.

And, according to a German study, an occasional winter swim in cold water causes oxidative stress, but, done regularly, such swimming leads to an adaptive antioxidant response; in other words, the body is better able to combat oxidative stress in general once it’s accustomed to cold-water swims.

The History of Healing With Cold Water

The ancient Indian term for very cold showers is ishnan. This refers to the moment when your body achieves the temperature with which it can defend itself against the cold water. Ishnan kicks in when the cold water first hits your skin, causing your capillaries (small blood vessels near the skin’s surface) to open.

As the cold shower continues, your capillaries close again, sending blood rushing back to your organs and glands. This natural flushing process brings youthfulness to your body by stimulating renewed glandular activity.

Cold water therapy was publicized by the German priest Sebastian Kneipp in 1849. That winter, Kneipp was successfully battling tuberculosis (a condition that was then incurable).

His method was cold water therapy, which he executed by plunging into the frigid Danube River several times each week. Kneipp’s 1886 book “My Water Cure”, became an international bestseller.

This technique is very easy to do and not only can recover your immune system it also brings you a lot of benefits.

Put cold water in a bathtub or basin, then add as much ice as you can get and soak your feet in the tub for 10-15 seconds. Repeating this method every night before going to bed will improve your immune system quickly.

Note: The method is especially beneficial for people with weak immune system – in this case, soak your feet in icy water every 4 hours.

Experts advise that cold water therapy is not for everyone. For example, the potential spike in blood pressure caused by cold water could be dangerous for those with uncontrolled high blood pressure. However, practitioners say the therapy can be safely used to reduce mildly high blood pressure (150/100 and below) or to raise low blood pressure.

If you have any questions about your blood pressure or haven’t had it checked recently, you should see your doctor for a blood pressure test before beginning a cold-water regimen.

Ice-Bath therapy is also to be avoided in cases of:

So far we’ve seen that this is a tool to help you prevent future problems. It’s also great if you’re suffering from a cold or the flu!.

In addition to quickly lowering your fever, your immune system will respond with strength against the infection or germs. Your ailment will disappear within a few days and with it, the discomfort that it produced.

Therefore, this is a simple and inexpensive way to ward off conditions that threaten your daily activities. It also helps you rest and relax your feet to face the next day with fresh energy. It will help you unwind and also marks the moment when your time for yourself begins. You’re done with your obligations.",conspiracy,C00750,big.foot
1306,"Those who have studied the inner workings of the mind have discovered ways and means on how to exploit its weakness. We all possess a sense of compassion, so that when we have the means to help someone in need we don’t hesitate to do so.

 

 The Jesuits are experts in mind reprogramming and they are playing mind games globally. It is sheer stupidity to discount their huge influence in governments and within the Vatican Church itself.

 The Vatican Church enjoys the trust of its members, and so is its brainchild, the Red Cross, although only few people ever realized that it owns the falsely charitable corporation through the Knights of Malta “membership” to ICRC.

The Red Cross global efforts generate billions yet only a trickle of those amount will ever reached the supposed intended recipients.

 From what we have experienced, it was the local archbishop that have been entrusted with the billions of peso donations relating to the Guinsaugon Landslide in 2006, and since the church is not subject to public audit, the funds disappeared in time.

 What is delivered in the disaster areas, however, is the forced vaccinations of the victims to introduced AIDS, hepatitis, Ebola or sterilization, so that in the end there won’t be any survivors left.

A similar scheme should be what’s happening in Haiti and elsewhere…

After raising nearly half a billion dollars for emergency disaster relief after the 2010 Haitian earthquake – including $170 million earmarked for ‘shelter relief’ – the American Red Cross has built a grand total of six houses, according to a new report.

An investigation by Propublica and NPR has shown a pattern of highly inefficient spending, management troubles, and a lack of local expertise which has resulted in very little concrete relief to the people of Haiti, despite massive outpouring of donations to one of the US’ most prominent charities.One major barrier to effective relief has been a reliance on foreigners who came to the country with little or no knowledge of local culture or language, while dismissing or disparaging Haitians, the report finds. Though the American Red Cross (ARC) says that 90% of the employees in the Haiti program are Haitians, they would not provide a breakdown of nationalities in top positions, and the Propublica investigation found very few made it to top slots.

“The implication that talented, smart, competent Haitians cannot be found in Haiti has to be dispelled, if we are going to give Haitians a chance to be part of rebuilding Haiti,” read a 2011 memo from Judith St. Fort, then-director of the Haiti program, that described the disparaging attitudes of senior ARC managers towards Haitian employees.

 Those foreign workers were also more costly — potentially up to $100,000 more a year — than Haitian employees.

 Despite Red Cross CEO Gail McGovern’s own promise to “share the way we are spending our dollars,” the ARC has so far not even disclosed what percentage of its revenues go to overhead. That percentage is considered by charity watchdogs to be an essential measure of a charity’s trustworthiness and commitment to its cause rather than to its executives’ paychecks.

Even outside of big picture numbers like overhead the ARC “has declined repeated requests to disclose the specific projects, to explain how much money went to each or to say what the results of each project were,” Propublica reports.

 The lack of transparency makes evaluating the Red Cross’ grand claims difficult, but some were clearly exaggerated or spun.

For example, the Red Cross says it has provided homes to more than 130,000 people, but that included people who were just “trained in proper construction techniques,” people who ended up in temporary shelters, or people who got rental assistance for a short period. Only six permanent homes have been entirely completed by the Red Cross in Haiti.

 Red Cross officials like McGovern have repeatedly claimed that “Millions of Haitians are safer, healthier, more resilient, and better prepared” and that the ARC has helped “more than 4.5 million” Haitians.

 But Jean-Max Bellerive, the Prime Minister of Haiti when the quake struck, finds those claims dubious when applied to a country with only 10 million people in total.

 “No, no,” Bellerive told Propublica, reacting to the Red Cross’ numbers. “It’s not possible.”

‘This Is Depressing’

 Though the Red Cross blames the poor result of the housing project on difficulties navigating Haiti’s land laws, others say it all came down to a lack of expertise in the region, and a wasteful reliance on subcontractors, with each layer taking another bite out of donations for administrative costs.

One former head of the Haiti shelter program for the ARC, Lee Malany, told Propublica that officials in Washington just didn’t seem to know how to spend the money they’d raised.

 “When I walked out of that meeting I looked at the people that I was working with and said, ‘You know this is very disconcerting, this is depressing,'” said Malany, who later resigned.

 “I said there’s no reason for me to stay here. I got on the plane and left.”

 91 Cents on The Dollar? Not Quite

 According to charity watchdogs, an average charity would spend 75% of its funds on its cause, and going by that measure, the Red Cross’ claims to efficient funding look great.

 “Minus the 9 cents overhead, 91 cents on the dollar will be going to Haiti. And I give you my word and my commitment, I’m banking my integrity, my own personal sense of integrity on that statement,” McGovern told CBS news a few months after the quake.

Unfortunately, many other subcontracted groups would then take their own chunk out of that 91 cents per dollar for administrative overhead. In one example, when the ARC sent the International Federation of the Red Cross $6 million for a particular project, the IRFC then took an additional 26% of that in overhead.

In another $5.4 million project for housing improvement, Propublica found that the figure that went directly to the work was closer to 60 cents on the dollar.

 Even factoring in the various sub-layers of administrative costs, Bellerive said he still didn’t understand where all the money went.

 “Five hundred million dollars in Haiti is a lot of money,” he said. “I’m not a big mathematician, but I can make some additions. I know more or less the cost of things. Unless you don’t pay for the gasoline the same price I was paying, unless you pay people 20 times what I was paying them, unless the cost of the house you built was five times the cost I was paying, it doesn’t add up for me.”

‘Where’s the $500 mn?’ Red Cross promises houses for 130,000 Haitians, ’builds only 6’

When a devastating earthquake struck the Western hemisphere’s poorest country in 2010, the American Red Cross was one of the organizations at the forefront of the humanitarian effort to rebuild it a year later, launching a multi-million-dollar effort.

 The main program – LAMIKA (a Creole acronym for ‘A Better Life in My Neighborhood’) – was to build hundreds of permanent homes to house some 130,000 people living in abject poverty after the quake.

 Now, in 2015, the Port-au-Prince neighborhood of Campeche is as dilapidated as ever, with hardly any new buildings, trash strewn around, animals walking the streets, and people enduring sub-standard conditions in self-made shacks.

 “Many residents live in shacks made of rusty sheet metal, without access to drinkable water, electricity or basic sanitation. When it rains, their homes flood and residents bail out mud and water,” an introduction to a report says.

 An investigation by NPR and ProPublica gained access to “confidential memos, emails from worried top officers, and accounts of a dozen frustrated and disappointed insiders” familiar with how the NGO broke its promises, misspent millions of dollars, and then issued self-congratulatory progress statements.

 The ensuing report reveals very different results to the ones outlined in CEO Gail McGovern’s project plan for Haiti, which promised “brand new communities” that would make “donors proud” and “help the people in Haiti.” She claimed her experience had made her more “flexible during emergencies.”

The investigation pointed to a series of systematic blunders and untruths surrounding the Haiti effort, however.

 The Red Cross’s internal proposal put the number of houses to be built at 700 by January 2013. In reality, only six houses were actually constructed.

 “We asked the Red Cross to show us around its projects in Haiti so we could see the results of its work. It declined,” the report reads.

 Part of the reason behind the failure is that the Red Cross “didn’t have the know-how” and “they had no development experience,” former employees said.

 In some cases, the NGO would give millions to other groups. Poor supervision and lack of proper oversight allowed these subcontractors to rack up inordinate bills for management and overhead costs.

 Another issue that could have hindered the Red Cross’s work in Haiti is trouble with the country’s “dysfunctional” land title system.

Other groups, which the report does not name, had similar problems but, according to the data, “ultimately built 9,000 homes compared to the Red Cross’s six.”

 Another possible reason for the dismal results, pointed out by current and former employees, was “an overreliance” on expats who could not speak French or Creole. The Red Cross’s statement, however, said that over 90 percent of people hired were Haitians. That didn’t seem to be reflected in the top positions, however, according to the authors of the report.

 According to the report, the NGO displayed an arrogant attitude to national staff – some of the very few people who could speak French and the local Creole. In some cases, the Red Cross actively discouraged their participation. This led to poor communication with the local population and, ultimately, to the failure of the outreach project.

 “Going to meetings with the community when you don’t speak the language is not productive,” one Haitian who worked on the project in Campeche said, adding that meetings would be skipped altogether at times.

Some $140,000 was spent on housing, food, and R&R for a foreign project manager, who also enjoyed four paid leaves a year. That comes to more than $100,000 more than would have been spent on a local equivalent.

 “A lot of money was spent on those people who were not Haitian, who had nothing to do with Haiti. The money was just going back to the United States,” one Haitian who coordinated expat housing for the Red Cross confessed.

 At the same time, Red Cross officials focused more on programs which would generate good publicity than those providing the most homes, according to testimony from Lee Malany, the project manager of the shelter program.

 He recalled a Washington meeting where top officials had no idea what to do with the millions they’d been given for housing projects.

 The organization would not provide details on how it spent the almost $500 million that it received, nor give specific details of how its projects were carried out. However, various promotional statements estimated that the initiative had repaired some 4,000 homes, erected temporary shelters for thousands of families, and donated $44 million for food aid and hospital construction.

 “The Red Cross’s public reports offer only broad categories about where $488 million in donations has gone,” according to the authors of the report.

Five years since the quake, a report by McGovern says: “Millions of Haitians are safer, healthier, more resilient, and better prepared for future disasters thanks to generous donations to the American Red Cross.”

 The organization claimed that it had helped 4.5 million Haitians, but according to reporters “there is reason to doubt” that.

 Asked if there was any truth to the Red Cross’s claims, Haiti’s Prime Minister didn’t seem to know how the numbers could add up: “No, no… it’s not possible,” Jean-Max Bellerive said, stressing that the country’s entire population is only about 10 million.

 “What the Red Cross told us is that they are coming here to change Campeche. Totally change it,” the report cites Jean Flaubert, the head of a community group set up by the Red Cross, as saying. “Now I do not understand the change that they are talking about. I think the Red Cross is working for themselves.”

 The Red Cross had already been embroiled in several scandals following 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina relief efforts, but that did not matter to the many people, organizations and US celebrities who continued to support it.

 The Haiti earthquake was touted as “a spectacular fundraising opportunity” within the organization, according to one former official involved with the program.

 A great number of high-profile people and organizations donated to the cause, including Michelle Obama, many Hollywood A-listers, and the NFL.

 It later turned out that the organization continued to collect funds for emergency relief projects even after it had hit its targets. The extra money was found to have been put toward eradicating the American Red Cross’s own debt, which exceeded $100 million.

The Red Cross has been caught stealing $400 million of relief money that should have gone to the people who suffered from Superstorm Sandy. But this is nothing new. When Haiti was hit with that giant earthquake in 2011, the Red Cross received hundreds of millions of dollars from people around the world.

 However, only about 5% of that money every got to the survivors, who, by the way, are still living in tent cities in mud, squalor and horrible sanitation conditions right across the road from the Red Cross headquarters in Haiti.

 But what this article doesn’t say is that the Vatican owns the Red Cross, and they have been in the money grabbing-stealing business for the past 1,700 years. The Vatican is the richest organization in the world. Read history and do your own research if you don’t believe me.

Red Cross and Vatican helped thousands of Nazis to escape

Research shows how travel documents ended up in hands of the likes of Adolf Eichmann, Josef Mengele and Klaus Barbie in the postwar chaos

The Red Cross and the Vatican both helped thousands of Nazi war criminals and collaborators to escape after the second world war, according to a book that pulls together evidence from unpublished documents.

 The Red Cross has previously acknowledged that its efforts to help refugees were used by Nazis because administrators were overwhelmed, but the research suggests the numbers were much higher than thought.

 Gerald Steinacher, a research fellow at Harvard University, was given access to thousands of internal documents in the archives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The documents include Red Cross travel documents issued mistakenly to Nazis in the postwar chaos.

 They throw light on how and why mass murderers such as Adolf Eichmann, Josef Mengele and Klaus Barbie and thousands of others evaded capture by the allies.

 By comparing lists of wanted war criminals to travel documents, Steinacher says Britain and Canada alone inadvertently took in around 8,000 former Waffen-SS members in 1947, many on the basis of valid documents issued mistakenly.

 The documents – which are discussed in Steinacher’s book Nazis on the Run: How Hitler’s henchmen fled justice – offer a significant insight into Vatican thinking, particularly, because its own archives beyond 1939 are still closed. The Vatican has consistently refused to comment.

 Steinacher believes the Vatican’s help was based on a hoped-for revival of European Christianity and dread of the Soviet Union. But through the Vatican Refugee Commission, war criminals were knowingly provided with false identities.

 The Red Cross, overwhelmed by millions of refugees, relied substantially on Vatican references and the often cursory Allied military checks in issuing travel papers, known as 10.100s.

 It believed it was primarily helping innocent refugees although correspondence between Red Cross delegations in Genoa, Rome and Geneva shows it was aware Nazis were getting through.

 “Although the ICRC has publicly apologised, its action went well beyond helping a few people,” said Steinacher.

 Steinacher says the documents indicate that the Red Cross, mostly in Rome or Genoa, issued at least 120,000 of the 10.100s, and that 90% of ex-Nazis fled via Italy, mostly to Spain, and North and South America – notably Argentina.

 Former SS members often mixed with genuine refugees and presented themselves as stateless ethnic Germans to gain transit papers. Jews trying to get to Palestine via Italy were sometimes smuggled over the border with escaping Nazis.

 Steinacher says that individual Red Cross delegations issued war criminals with 10.100s “out of sympathy for individuals … political attitude, or simply because they were overburdened”. Stolen documents were also used to whisk Nazis to safety. He said: “They were really in a dilemma. It was difficult. It wanted to get rid of the job. Nobody wanted to do it.”

 The Red Cross refused to comment directly on Steinacher’s findings but the organisation says on its website: “The ICRC has previously deplored the fact that Eichmann and other Nazi criminals misused its travel documents to cover their tracks.”

Bigfoot Creature Captured On Video In Named As “Murder Suspect” By Russian Police

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

An extraordinary report circulating in the Kremlin today issued by the Federal Security Service (FSB) says that their enhanced biometry analysis of a 2016 video taken in the US State of Michigan that depicts a Bigfoot creature (called Yeti’s, Alma’s or Menk’s in Russia) is a “near exact/perfect” match to a Bigfoot video captured in the Adyghe Republic in 2015—thus placing this American “hominoid” on the murder suspect list relating to the 1959 Dyatlov Pass Incident where 9 young hikers were slaughtered by an as yet unknown, but suspected to be, Bigfoot creature. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]

According to this report, on 25 January 1959, nine young hikers from the Ural Polytechnic Institute sent out on an expedition from the city of Yekaterinburg (in 1959 named Sverdlovsk) in the Sverdlovsk Oblast to the Otorten Mountain range, but when they failed to reach their destination, on 11 February, local search parties were sent out to discover their whereabouts.

By 20 February 1959, this report continues, these nine young hikers were still missing and a Federal criminal investigation was begun as well as a new search conducted by Federal police forces and Russian military aircraft.

On 25 February 1959, this report grimly notes, the first discoveries were made as to the fate of these nine young hikers—and that over the next two months showed they had all been savagely killed by an “unknown beast” that had, literally, torn apart their bodies.

Medical examination of the bodies revealed strange anomalies, this report explains, with all of the victems having odd injuries that forensic science-doctors at the time could not explain—such as 23-year-old victim Ludmila Alexandrovna Dubinina who was found with her head tilted backward, mouth wide open as if screaming, her tongue ripped out by the root, and her eyes forcibly removed from their sockets.

In 1962, this report notes, the Committee for State Security (former Soviet Union KGB) closed their investigation into these hikers death by stating it was “unable to be solved”—but which this past January (2016) the Investigative Committee (SLEDCOM) ordered back to “active/immediate investigation status”.

As to why SLEDCOM ordered this case reopened, this report explains, began with a report of a new body discovered in the Dyatlov Pass Incident region on 9 January, and though finding no cause for alarm, certain DNA forensic evidence from the original investigation into the 1959 deaths of the 9 young hikers raised many questions that in the 1950’s and 1960’s science could not have answered.

And as to the new DNA evidence obtained from the 1959 victems of the Dyatlov Pass Incident that “alarmed/alerted” SLEDCOM investigators, this report continues, was it being an “exact comparison” to the only known Bigfoot creature to have ever been captured—and who was named Zana.

Zana, this report explains, was captured in the region of (present day Abkhazia) in 1850 and described to be an “ape woman” and “Neanderthal” having immense power and whose height was 6 feet 6 inches.

Covered in thick hair, and able to outrun a horse, this report notes, Zana was eventually “tamed/domesticated”, and until her death, in 1890, had a number of children by a number of different men—some of whom died due to her “habit/custom” of washing her newborn babies in cold running river water, even in the winter time.

Though “what/who” exactly Zana actually was had never been determined in her lifetime, this report says, but an astounding discovery was made about her in 2015 by Professor Bryan Sykes of the University of Oxford who in examining the genetics of her ancestors found “her DNA to be unparalleled” making her “half human, half ape”—and as ancient legends have long described the Bigfoot creature as being.

With Zana having been confirmed as being a Bigfoot creature by DNA evidence, and that same DNA evidence being discovered on the mutilated bodies of the victems of the 1959 Dyatlov Pass Incident, and the 2015 video evidence of another of these creatures being sighted in the same Caucasus Mountain region where Zana was first captured, this report states that neither SLEDCOM or the FSB have the “power/authority” under existing Federation laws to disregard the facts of this admittedly strange case making a Bigfoot creature a murder suspect.

And as to how seriously the FSB is in investigating this suspected Bigfoot murder case is contained in this report explaining how Russian police officials worked with the Ministry of Defense (MoD) in analyzing the 2015 Russian Bigfoot video and 2016 Michigan Bigfoot video utilizing the same military computer identification systems that biometrically identifies Islamic terrorists in the Levant War Zone from both aircraft and satellite video photography systems.

This report concludes without its stating how this strange murder investigation will continue, but with this being the first time a Bigfoot creature has been named as a suspect in a human crime, one wonders what they can do. [Note: Under Russian law, a murder suspect can be anyone identified as knowing something about the crime, regardless of how much time has passed.]

610,"Five people have died, including a gunman, after a shooting in a subdivision west of Atlanta , US that also left two children injured, police said.

Authorities arrived at the Douglasville subdivision of two-story homes, about 20 miles west of Atlanta, after receiving a 911 call around 3pm local time on Saturday, Douglas County Sheriff's Lt. Glenn Daniel said.

Lt. Daniel said a man came to a house and shot his ex-wife and several children. Police were still working Saturday to identify the victims and confirm their relationships, he said.

The shooter, whose name has not been released, is believed to have died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Lt. Daniel said.

Lt. Daniel said he did not immediately know when the couple divorced or whether the family had prior contact with police.

""I've been in law enforcement out here 20 years and this is the worst I've ever seen,"" he said.

Daniel said that some neighbours apparently heard or saw the shooting and came outside to assist the victims until rescuers arrived. Some victims appeared to have been shot inside the residence while others were apparently shot outside. Investigators have not released the names of the suspect or the victims because their family members have not yet been notified. The motive of the shooting was not immediately clear.",mainstream,M0d01a,big.foot
233,"I'm probably not the first person you'd choose to send off round the world looking for monsters. There's the credibility problem to start with. I'm best-known for dressing up in silly costumes and playing practical jokes on people on TV. What if I actually came across one of these beasts and announced the fact to the world? I don't think I would make the most believable of witnesses.

Nevertheless, I did spend a lot of the past year doing just this. I was Dom Joly, Monster Hunter, and I printed off a business card to prove it. First I had to decide on my destinations. Some were obvious: the Himalayas, for the Yeti, a hairy beast who wanders their upper slopes, harassing mountain climbers and Tintin. And Loch Ness, for our very own Nessie, who lures tourists into much purchasing of tat.

As I'm married to a Canadian I had heard of that country's own monster – Ogopogo, a Nessie-type creature that lives in Lake Okanagan in British Columbia. The lake is bordered by vineyards and peach orchards and was a most pleasant place in which to go monster-hunting.

I discovered another couple online. Explorers have written for several centuries about mokele m'bembe (blocker of rivers) a dinosaur-type creature said to live in Lake Tele, in the north of the Congo. This was by far the most difficult of my trips, with days in a canoe and trekking through forest before meeting a particularly tricky tribe whose permission I needed to get to the lake. Things went pear-shaped as everyone got drunk on ""jungle gin"" and spears and machetes suddenly made a very unwelcome appearance.

The second was in Japan. I'd read about the hibagon that roamed the hills around Hiroshima and was reputed to be a man who had been irradiated by the atomic bomb. This seemed unlikely but my dad, who was in the Fleet Air Arm, flew over Hiroshima the day after the bomb had been dropped, and I had always been fascinated by the place.

Then of course, there was Bigfoot, rumoured to roam the coast from California to British Columbia, with hundreds of sightings a year. Bigfoot was the main reason I got interested in monsters in the first place.

I can still remember the excitement of seeing the Patterson-Gimlin footage for the first time. This was a shaky 16mm film taken in a place called Bluff Creek, northern California, in 1967. The footage shows a large ape-like creature, walking on two legs in a jerky manner and staring back at the cameraman. Some hail this as conclusive proof; others claim it is a fake. There is a Bigfoot museum (bigfootcountry.net) in Willow Creek, Humboldt County – ""Ground Zero"" for Bigfoot hunters – and that was where I decided to head.

I love northern California: as soon as you drive over the Golden Gate Bridge and up Highway One, you are in a very special place. First you hit Hitchcock country: Bodega Bay is where he filmed The Birds, and there were some particularly large and scary looking seagulls hovering above my car.

Then I headed inland, through various areas of intoxication. First the wineries of Napa and Sonoma, then the Microbrewery Belt, and finally Weed Country. It may be a coincidence that Bigfoot territory is slap-bang in the middle of this last area …

Moss-covered coastal oaks give way to huge forests of redwood trees. If you've never seen a redwood, it's difficult to describe their power. I'm not normally awed by nature, but the redwood brings out my inner hippy. I have a huge urge to hug them, except it would take about 20 of me. On a lovely stretch called Avenue of the Giants (avenueofthegiants.net) I drove through some of the most impressive of these woody behemoths, wishing I'd rented a convertible so I could really appreciate my insignificance.

I stopped to try to photograph some of the trees (it's almost impossible) and got into an altercation with a pick-up truck full of lady rednecks. It ended up like a scene from Deliverance (not that scene). Suffice to say I hot-footed it out of there and ended up in the wonderfully named city of Eureka, which boasts a couple of extraordinary mock-Gothic Victorian buildings, including the Carson Mansion, that are said to have inspired some of the weirder parts of Disneyland.

From there it was just an hour to Willow Creek – a one-street town much frequented in summer by fishermen and white-water rafters, drawn by the beautiful Trinity River. I stayed for a couple of nights, checking out the Bigfoot Museum and talking to Twin-Peaks-esque locals before heading off into the great unknown.

It's only when you do this that you realise just how possible it might be for something like Bigfoot to remain largely undiscovered. The vegetation is thick and impenetrable and covers a vast area. I found this out to my cost when I crashed my car in snow 18 miles up an empty road. With no mobile signal I had no option but to walk out (breaking the Ray Mears rule of always staying by your vehicle). It was very cold, and there are mountain lions, bears, paranoid, armed weed farmers and Bigfoot roaming the area …

In a movie this would have been where I blacked out and woke up in Bigfoot's nest with the creature breastfeeding me. Fortunately a lovely man called Peter, who was out mushroom picking, saved me at the seven-mile mark. Peter's parents run Marble Ranch (marblemountainranch.com), a ""dude ranch"" – the sort of place where cissy east coasters can come to learn to ride, shoot and survive in the wilderness (à la City Slickers). As Peter drove me off the mountain I couldn't help thinking that this was exactly the sort of trip I needed to take before my next adventure. That night, safe in a log cabin straight out of Elle Décor, I ate a steak the size of Texas and slept the sleep of kings.

After all my trips I'm still not sure whether monsters exist. I did catch something on film in the Okanagan. I'm sure it's possible for things to exist without discovery in places like the Congo and the Himalayas, and there are just too many people who've seen something in Bigfoot territory for there to be nothing at all. Maybe you should go find out yourself. Just print a business card saying you're a monster hunter and head off into the unknown.

1142,"When the Russians take decisive action, it is usually for a reason. As you will see below, the Russians have suddenly decided that now is the time to create an organization that will be tasked with detecting, tracking and potentially destroying incoming asteroids. Are they doing this now because they have finally decided that this is a good idea, or has something gotten their attention? Of course they are not likely to publicly admit if they have come to the conclusion that a gigantic space rock is heading directly toward us. Just like the U.S. government, the Russian government is very interested in maintaining social order, and so they would probably delay telling the public about a potential asteroid impact for as long as possible.

In life, what people do is far more important than what they say, and the new center that the Russians have just created will not just be watching giant space rocks. According to Futurism, this new organization will be in charge of making sure “they don’t collide with Earth”…

Russian space agency Roscosmos is creating a center devoted to monitoring meteors, comets, and asteroids to ensure they don’t collide with Earth — even it means having to blow them up in space.

“As part of the creation of a monitoring system and information support for the safety of space activities in near-Earth space, we plan to launch the Russian Center for Small Celestial Bodies, whose main task will be to detect and track celestial bodies approaching Earth,” Igor Bakaras, a senior official at Roscosmos subsidiary TsNIIMash, told Russian-owned news agency Sputnik.

Certainly nobody can fault the Russians for allocating resources toward this purpose.

Our solar system is full of potentially dangerous giant space rocks, and a big enough impact could literally end our civilization.

But why now?

According to a British news source, this new organization will be evaluating whether it is better “to destroy celestial objects or steer them on to new trajectories and away from Earth”…

Roscosmos, the Russian equivalent of Nasa, wants to work out if it’s possible to destroy celestial objects or steer them on to new trajectories and away from Earth.

This could involve slamming a ‘kinetic impactor’ craft in the rock or using a satellite to drag it onto a new course. Nukes could also be sent into space to blow up the rocks.

A new department at Roscosmos called the Russian Centre for Celestial Bodies will be tasked with looking into space to find comets and asteroids approaching Earth.

Once again, nobody can argue with the value of such a major project, but isn’t NASA already doing all this?

Couldn’t the Russians just sit back and let us Americans do all the work?

I wish someone would ask Vladimir Putin that question.

And this sudden move by the Russians comes just one year after the U.S. issued a “National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan”…

In 2018, The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy released a new report titled the “National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan”.

The 18-page document outlines the steps that NASA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will take over the next 10 years to both prevent dangerous asteroids from striking Earth and prepare the country for the potential consequences of such an event.

Maybe U.S. officials suddenly decided last year that having a plan for incoming giant space rocks was a great idea, and maybe the Russians decided that it was such a great idea that they should copy us.

Or maybe both governments know something that they aren’t telling us yet.

Of course the truth is that NASA has not even identified most of the giant space rocks that are floating around out there. For example, back in July a very large asteroid came very close to hitting us…

A 427-foot-wide asteroid whizzed within 45,000 miles of Earth on Thursday.

While that may sound far away, 45,000 miles is what astronomers consider a close shave: It’s less than 20% of the distance between Earth and the moon. This was the closest we’ve come to an “Armageddon”-like scenario in at least a few years.

If that asteroid had actually hit our planet, it would have been the worst disaster that any of us have ever seen by a very wide margin.

And according to leaked emails, officials at NASA only knew about it the day before it whizzed by us…

Travelling at 55,000mph and measuring 426 feet by 187ft (130m x 57m), NASA only realised 2019 OK was coming 24 hours before it passed.

Experts say that had it hit, it would have devastated an entire city like London with over 30 times the energy of the atomic blast at Hiroshima.

So the truth is that we could be hit by a giant space rock at any time, and none of us may have any idea that it is even coming.

With that being said, there are a couple of enormous asteroids that scientists do know about that could potentially be major problems over the next decade.

The first one that I want to discuss is 2007 FT3. That is not a fancy name, and not that much is known about the asteroid, but apparently there is a chance that it “might hit the planet on Oct. 2, 2024”…

In the case of 2007 FT3, Sentry reported that the asteroid could hit Earth between the years 2024 and 2116. During these years, Sentry recorded a total of 164 potential Earth impacts caused by the asteroid. As noted by the monitoring system, there’s a chance that 2007 FT3 might hit the planet on Oct. 2, 2024.

By the way, Rosh Hashanah begins on the evening of October 2nd, 2024. I don’t know if that is important, but I thought I would throw that out there.

According to NASA, this asteroid would hit at a speed of approximately 46,000 miles per hour, and it would “create a crater that’s several miles long”…

Based on the data collected by Sentry, the asteroid has an estimated diameter of about 1,115 feet, which makes it almost as tall as the Empire State Building. The monitoring system noted that it could breach Earth’s atmosphere and hit the planet at a velocity of around 46,000 miles per hour.

Given the asteroid’s speed and size, it is certainly capable of causing high levels of destruction if it ends up colliding with Earth. Upon impact, it would create a crater that’s several miles long. The energy that will be released from the asteroid’s explosion would be powerful enough to level an entire city as well as its neighboring areas.

2007 FT3 is not getting much publicity at all, but a slightly larger asteroid that could potentially hit us in 2029 is getting far more attention.

On April 13th, 2029, it is being projected that Apophis will pass by our planet at a distance that is “ten times closer than the moon”. The following comes from Wikipedia…

The closest known approach of Apophis comes on April 13, 2029, when the asteroid comes to within a distance of around 31,000 kilometres from Earth’s surface. The distance, a hair’s breadth in astronomical terms, is ten times closer than the moon, and even closer than some man-made satellites.[23] It will be the closest asteroid of its size in recorded history. On that date, it will become as bright as magnitude 3.1[22] (visible to the naked eye from rural as well as darker suburban areas, visible with binoculars from most locations).[24] The close approach will be visible from Europe, Africa, and western Asia. During the approach, Earth will perturb Apophis from an Aten-class orbit with a semi-major axis of 0.92 AU to an Apollo-class orbit with a semi-major axis of 1.1 AU.

NASA insists that it will not actually hit us, but other independent researchers are skeptical.

And if Apophis doesn’t hit us then, NASA has listed ten other future dates when it potentially could…

Over in Russia, they are so concerned about this asteroid that they have “developed intercontinental ballistic missiles that aim to destroy asteroid Apophis”…

In what sounds like an elevator pitch for an Armageddon sequel, Russian scientists announced that they’ve developed intercontinental ballistic missiles that aim to destroy asteroid Apophis, which is going to swing by Earth in 2036.

Also referred to as 99942 Apophis, it measures 210-330 meters (690-1080 feet) in diameter. According to a Slate article by astronomer Phil Plait an encounter with Earth would mean not so fun times for our planet; “it would release the energy equivalent to more than 1 billion tons of TNT exploding, at least 20 times more than the largest nuke ever detonated!”

Russian scientists have also warned that Apophis could have “hundreds of opportunities to hit the Earth over the course of the next century”.

But for now, both American and Russian scientists are assuring us that everything is just fine and that there is no reason to panic.

Do you believe them?

Maybe they are telling us the truth.

Maybe there is nothing to be concerned about at all.

But of course both governments have a long track record of being loose with the truth, and it wouldn’t be much of a surprise at all if they weren’t exactly being straight with us.

291,"The presence of conserved noncoding regions in genomes is a footprint that points to the likely existence of conserved modes of gene regulation. In plants, there appear to be fewer conserved noncoding sequences than in animals; because they are shorter, they are harder to find. Freeling et al. examined the genome of Arabidopsis, which underwent a duplication of its genome (the α event) in its recent history, in order to identify noncoding sequences that border genes and that have been retained. Large regions, relatively rich in conserved noncoding sequences (such as the G-box CACGTG), were designated Bigfoot and were often associated with transcription factor binding motifs. Smaller regions of noncoding sequences were also identified (and dubbed Smallfoot) and were often linked to components of signal transduction pathways. Few of these noncoding sequences were identified outside of paralogous genes, suggesting that the regulatory regions of other genes are less conserved or may evolve at a rapid rate. — LMZ",mainstream,M0ee4e,big.foot
339,"Bristol-Myers Squibb, which is shifting its focus toward biologics manufacturing, will unload an API plant in Ireland to a South Korean company that has aspirations of becoming a big deal in contract manufacturing.

The U.S. drugmaker said today that it will sell its plant in Swords to SK Biotek, a unit of South Korea’s third largest conglomerate, SK Holdings. SK has been a BMS ingredient supplier for a decade.

The two kept terms under wraps except to say the deal should close in Q4 and that SK will continue to produce the products BMS now makes at the plant, which includes the API for Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer’s anticoagulant Eliquis. SK Biotek will take on about 300 workers at the facility, while some will transfer to jobs in Dublin, a BMS spokesman said in an email.

SK Biotek, the first South Korean company to set up shop in Ireland, will use the BMS plant as a base for its burgeoning contract development and manufacturing business. It plans to add marketing and research and development operations at the site, as well as spend money on upgrades to boost capacity.

“This transaction is an important step to achieve our goal of becoming a leading global CDMO,” SK Biotek CEO Junku Park said in a statement.

SK Holdings, which has revenues that top $120 billion, has decided that contract pharma manufacturing is a natural offshoot of its chemical and ingredient businesses and has identified it as a growth driver for the company. It has four plants in South Korea, according to its website, and SK Biotek had 2015 revenues of KRW 75.5 billion ($6.6 million). It says it expects the unit to reach KRW 130 billion in sales this year. It has said it would like to someday rival CDMOs like Lonza and Boehringer Ingelheim.

Last year, SK Holdings indicated it was working on a couple of deals, worth about $500 million each, to buy API sites in the U.S. and Europe.

Like other big drugmakers, BMS has been scaling back in small-molecule production. In 2015, it closed an API plant at Cruiserath in North County Dublin and shut down a production line at the plant in Swords. That has happened as its pipeline of products shifted toward biologic drugs. It is building a $900 million, 320,000-square-foot biologics plant adjacent to a bulk manufacturing facility in Dublin.

81,"An Oregon couple has been told they must destroy a 2-acre pond on their land — the property’s most attractive feature — because the government said so.

Although Jon and Sabrina Carey purchased the 10-acre property near Butte Falls two and a half years ago, the pond has been in place for 40 years — but that fact doesn’t matter to the Jackson County Watermaster’s Office.

“I basically bought a lemon,” said Jon, who became teary-eyed at the edge of the partially ice-covered body of water being targeted by government, in an interview with the Mail Tribune. “That’s how they explained it to me.”

But the couple desperately wants to keep the stunning longstanding feature in tact, so, as the Mail Tribune reports, the Careys have “pleaded with the Medford Water Commission to adopt the pond and treat it as a municipal water source, something Jackson County Watermaster Larry Menteer has opposed because of the precedent it would set.

“The Water Commission has rights to the watershed around the Careys’ property, where dozens, if not hundreds, of ponds are located, as well as Medford’s primary source of water, Big Butte Springs.”

And the Careys aren’t the only people in the watershed who’ve had difficulties with, well, ‘the government’s’ water.

Eagle Point resident Gary Harrington spent 90 days in jail for illegally harboring some 13 million gallons of illicit rainwater — that’s enough rain to fill around 20 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

Harrington masterfully crafted several ponds on his property — even building docks for one, and stocking it with largemouth bass — but his insistence the water would assist in fire control and prevention didn’t satisfy the government, since a “1925 state law dictates that the water belongs to the Medford Water Commission.”

“The bigger story here is that rainwater collection is indeed kosher in Oregon, provided that you’re capturing it from an artificial, impervious surface such as a rooftop with the assistance of rainwater barrels.

“But an extensive reservoir set-up complete with 10- and 20-foot-tall dams is verboten without the proper, state-issued water-right permits — after all, Oregon law dictates that water is a publicly owned resource — and Harrington did not possess said permits.”

Harrington and the Oregon Water Resources Department waged an extended battle over the ponds, and at one point, it was ruled he would be allowed to keep everything in place — but that decision was backtracked in less than one year.

Ultimately, “Rain Man,” as he came to be called, found himself charged with nine misdemeanors, spent three months behind bars, and had to shell out $1,500 in fines — and was ordered to destroy the dams and drain all the ponds.

Harrington’s case might have been infinitely more complex than the Careys’ — considering the large volume of water and infrastructure he’d put in place — but they share the same theme of overbearing government and arguably wholly unnecessary law versus the right of people to do as they please with their property.

“When you’re honest, they take everything away from you,” said Sabrina Carey, who inspected country records — which plainly showed the pond — before they purchased the property.

Going by the book might have been the ‘fatal’ error for the couple, however, since the county didn’t take issue with the pond until Jon sought to grow legal medical cannabis on the land and had to prove there was a viable source of water for the grow operation.

According to the Watermaster’s Office, the previous owners had not received a permit for the pond, so the Careys were now in violation of Oregon regulations — and they would have to shoulder the cost of draining the water.

In an effort to prove the pond is legitimate and persuade county government to allow it to remain on the property, the couple stopped using it — even though the well on their land had run dry — and began shipping in the water for daily living and gardening from nearly Butte Falls.

They’ve also had no choice but to hire attorney Sarah Liljefelt, who filed a request with Jackson County to provide a permit for them to store water, stating:

“The reservoir on Ms. Carey’s property, though small, is one of the largest in the area.”

As the Mail Tribune notes, “Liljefelt said the pond is an important source of water for beavers, otters, elk, deer, bear, mountain lion, bobcat, bald eagle osprey, great blue heron, snowy egret, Canada geese and the western pond turtle.”

By all appearances, the large pool of water does more good for the environment than if it weren’t there at all — during their fight with the State, the Careys even suggested it be used for fire control and prevention, like Harrington did, as the pond is easily accessible by fire crews.

But the county has displayed only nonsensical obstinance on the issue.

“This pond seems to be doing way more public good than not being here. Why, now, is it so important to be removed?” Jon lamented.

Indeed, the 40-year-old man doesn’t even profit from the medical cannabis grown on the land he and his wife own, as he literally gives the crop — free of charge — to friends.

“I don’t make anything out of this,” he said.

Members of the Water Commission disagree on whether this is an issue worth fighting over at all, but as the Mail Tribune reports,

“Water Commission staff found several problems with the Careys’ request, including setting a precedent that could prompt similar requests and weaken state statutes while not meeting the definition of ‘municipal water source.’

“The staff found it would be very difficult to access the water stored in the pond for municipal reasons, and further monitoring and following up on compliance issues would be difficult and costly for the commission.”

However, the commission also failed to state why this should be a matter for the government in the first place — why punitive bureaucracy needs to meddle with a pond on private property, serving as a valuable ecosystem, that poses no threat to anyone or anything, and isn’t even an eyesore, must be destroyed.

Besides a trailer home and dilapidated house, the pond is the only thing of value on their acreage, and, obviously, as Sabrina said, “We didn’t buy it for the double-wide.”

She told the Mail Tribune the pond should have been registered with the Oregon Water Resources Department nine years ago, but the owners at that time did not reside on the property and didn’t do so.

They have even offered to reduce the pond’s size, allow officials to inspect it when necessary, and have provided a draft easement to the commission in hopes of allowing the prized water feature to remain intact — thus far to no avail.

“We’re just trying to do it by the rules,” Sabrina explained. “I’m trying to cooperate.”

1192,"Western scientists first learned about extinct giant ape species Gigantopithecus blacki—the largest primate to ever exist—in 1935 when an anthropologist came across some of its massive molars in Chinese drug stores selling them as dragon teeth. Since then, researchers have identified thousands of teeth and a few partial jawbones from the creature. With these pieces in hand, they’ve tried to fit the bigfoot-like ape into the primate family tree. Without any usable DNA, however, the task has been difficult.

Now, using proteins in dental enamel, researchers report they've finally found how the Gigantopithecus fits into the great ape puzzle, according to a new study published in the journal Nature.

According to a press release, DNA has been key in helping scientists map out the messy relationships between primates and hominids that lived within the past 50,000 years. But in fossils older than that, DNA is very difficult to extract and scientists have only done it successfully in a few rare cases, including in one 400,000-year-old hominin specimen.

Gigantopithecus remains are estimated to be between 300,000 to 2 million years old, placing its reign at some point during the Pleistocene epoch.

No Gigantopithecus DNA has ever been recovered. That’s why an international team of researchers used techniques from an emerging field called proteomics to get molecular information from the Gigantopithecus molar in the new study.

In traditional DNA sequencing, pieces of the DNA molecule are put through a process that copies its sequence of nucleotides and puts them back together into a full genome. The quality and completeness of the genome, however, depends on how well-preserved the original sample of DNA is. Most DNA degrades much more quickly, especially in hot, humid climates.

But in proteomics, researchers more or less reverse-engineer DNA by looking at the proteins preserved in teeth, which last much longer. Because each protein is made up of amino acids, and because each amino acid is encoded by a three-letter DNA sequence, researchers can produce snippets of ancient DNA by analyzing the proteins. Last September, the technique was used to properly place a 1.7-million-year-old species of wooly rhinoceros in its family tree, proving that the method could be used to understand ancient animals.

Researchers applied the protein-mining technique to a 1.9 million-year-old molar from Gigantopithecus found in a Chuifeng cave in China. Gretchen Vogel at Science reports the team dissolved tiny amounts of enamel from the tooth and then analyzed it using mass spectrometry. They were able to identify 500 peptides, or short chains of amino acids, from six different proteins.

Bruce Bower at Science News reports that five of those proteins still occur in extant ape and monkey species. The team compared the accumulated differences in the proteins to those animals, finding that the massive Gigantopithecus is a distant relative of modern orangutans. The two lineages likely diverged from a common ancestor over 10 million years ago.

“Until now, all that was known about this species was based on the morphology of the many teeth and the few mandibles found, typical of a herbivore,"" study author Enrico Cappellini, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Copenhagen, says in the press release. “Now, the analysis of ancient proteins, or palaeoproteomics, has allowed us to reconstruct the evolutionary history of this distant relative.”

The success of this technique has big implications for the future of paleoanthropology. Because many of the fossilized remains of ancient hominins come from tropical and subtropical areas, like East Africa, southern Africa and Indonesia, there’s little chance that viable DNA has survived. But the protein trick changes everything.

“Until now, it has only been possible to retrieve genetic information from up to 10,000-year-old fossils in warm, humid areas,” Welker tells Katie Hunt at CNN. “This is interesting, because ancient remains of the supposed ancestors of our species, Homo sapiens, are also mainly found in subtropical areas, particularly for the early part of human evolution. This means that we can potentially retrieve similar information on the evolutionary line leading to humans.”

The team also says that they may be able to look at more than just molars. It could be possible to analyze protein sequences in the bones of apes and hominins that lost their viable DNA long ago.

While the study tells researchers a little bit about Gigantopithecus’s origins, Capellini tells Hunt that it doesn’t shed much light on what the massive ape looked like or how it behaved.",mainstream,M0bb30,big.foot

Local people and scientists have found 15 sets of giant footprints on one of the island's beaches. The prints – each showing three vast toes formed into an arrowhead shape – have been hailed as the biggest and best ever found in Scotland.

566,"The Miami Herald reports that a local couple is going all the way to the state supreme court to fight a local ordinance banning front-yard vegetable gardens:

Hermine Ricketts and her husband Tom Carroll may grow fruit trees and flowers in the front yard of their Miami Shores house… Vegetables, however, are not allowed. Ricketts and Carroll thought they were gardeners when they grew tomatoes, beets, scallions, spinach, kale and multiple varieties of Asian cabbage. But according to a village ordinance that restricts edible plants to backyards only, they were actually criminals. “That’s what government does – interferes in people’s lives,” Ricketts said. “We had that garden for 17 years. We ate fresh meals every day from that garden. Since the village stepped its big foot in it, they have ruined our garden and my health.”

These sorts of stories pop up several times a year. They are often discussed at free-market oriented and libertarian sites to illustrate just the myriad of ways that the state interferes in our daily lives. Many times, they intervene to prohibit totally innocuous activities like growing a front-yard garden.

What articles like these often fail to point out of course, is that these laws didn’t appear out of nowhere. They are often passed because some voters demanded the city council or the county commission pass laws prohibiting front-yard gardens, or backyard chicken coops, or other non-violent activities deemed by some to be a nuisance to the neighborhood. These laws then persist over time because the majority of voters either agree with the laws, or don’t feel strongly enough about the matter to demand a change.

In Miami Shores, the law against front-yard gardens was likely passed because at least a few people felt that front yard gardens were not so innocuous after all.

This situation illustrates, yet again, a problem with majoritarian government. If a majority of the citizens of Miami Shores — or whatever jurisdiction — hate front-yard gardens, then they likely to vote for candidates who will vote to ban them. The minority, of course, is simply out of luck.

The implied solution in many of these free-market publications is that government should just get out of the business of regulating front yards. OK. But then people will begin to ask the inevitable questions:
• Should people be able to just dump garbage in their front yards then?
• Can they park a food truck there 24-hours a day and sell hamburgers out of them?
• Can they put in their front yards a 20-foot sculpture of a jackalope?

If the response is “of course not” then the next question is “why not?” or “so what is prohibited in front yards?” If a pile of old appliances is not acceptable in the front yard, why is a vegetable garden acceptable? What if many people think gardens are nearly as unsightly as an old car on blocks?

You can probably figure out where this leads. We’re right back at regulating what people can do in their front yards.

Indeed, when Ricketts laments that “government interferes in people’s lives” in response to the ban on her garden, one wonders if she’d be equally libertarian if her neighbors had piles of junk cars in their front yards.

So, is there no solution here? Must we choose between bans on gardens on the one side, and piles of garbage on the other?

The solution, of course, lies in decentralization and privatization.

The Role of the Homeowners Association

Were local governments to totally abandon all regulations on neighborhood aesthetics, it’s easy to imagine what would happen next. Assuming, of course, that they were unable to convince local governments to ban allegedly “unsightly” features like front-yard gardens, those who hate the veggie gardens would then seek a solution in private homeowners associations.

Those who want to be surrounded by neighbors who only plant nicely manicured lawns can have it — provided they find others willing to enter into a private agreement banning front-yard gardens.

And this is exactly what many people do when they choose to move to covenant-controlled communities where they believe their “property values” will be protected by private agreements banning unsightly features to front yards or houses.

People like to complain about their homeowners associations, of course, but there’s a reason they aren’t going away. The homeowner agreements don’t actually deter a large number of people from purchasing homes in those communities. Thus, the developers who sell houses there have little reason to believe consumers want a more laissez-faire neighborhood. Many residents actually like knowing that the local association won’t tolerate a weed-filled front yard or an old car up on blocks in the driveway.

This is why the homeowners association became widespread in the first place:

Some homeowners association are more strict than others, but most are far more strict than the local municipal governments. Indeed, those who want front-yard gardens will probably find it easier to find a municipal government that tolerates them, than a private homeowners association. Finding a homeowners association that allows chicken coops is probably even harder. Many municipal governments, on the other hand, allow them.

Imagine, for instance, that Ricketts convinced a group of people on her side of town to form a secessionist neighborhood that was able to separate from the city of Miami Shores. It became West Miami Shores.

The Ricketts and their neighbors would then get to have their front-yard gardens. This would also be good for the residents in Old Miami Shores. When potential new residents come looking around to buy a house in Old Miami Shores, the anti-garden people can simply say “you want a front-yard garden? Don’t move here, move over there.”

Yes, it’s true that some residents in both areas will then have to move if they want to live in a neighborhood that favors their particular views on front-yard gardens. But at least now both groups have the option of getting what they want.

In the absence of either of these options, we’re only left with a situation in which the majority can run untrammeled over a minority, and the minority has no escape.

240,"Bigfoot is a racing video game released in July 1990 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was developed by Beam Software and published by Acclaim. The game was advertised by the legendary monster truck of the same name in the cartoon segment of the 1990 television show, Video Power, titled The Power Team. The show also often used sound effects for the actions of not only Bigfoot, but others as well.

The gameplay involves racing monster trucks including the title truck, Bigfoot (blue). The computer controlled trucks are green (The Growler), and yellow (The Charger). The player begins competing against The Growler, but if the computer's truck runs out of money it will forfeit the race and be replaced with The Charger. Should The Charger run out of money it will be replaced with a second green vehicle and so on. It was not uncommon for a skilled player to be challenged by three to four different monster trucks during the game. In two player mode the 2nd player's truck is red. The object of the game is to advance to the next level (race) with incurring the least amount of damage as possible. The levels consist of car crushing, mud bog, tractor pull, hill climb, and the later levels are a combination of everything except the sled pull, simply called a drag race. To advance to the next event the player must complete a ""cross country"" race collecting money, points, etc. without damaging the truck.",mainstream,M11d3f,big.foot
730,"Is bunion pain getting in the way of your life?

Bunions can have a negative effect on your day to day life, making it hard to walk and wear shoes which are tight to your feet.

A bunion is a bony lump that forms on the inside of your foot at the big toe joint. This can affect your big toe by pushing it to point excessively towards your second toe.
• None Hardened skin on the bottom of your foot

Not sure if it’s a bunion? Here is other foot related symptoms:
• Gout – redness, heat, swelling and pain that comes and goes
• Arthritis – aching, swollen and stiff; usually worse in the morning
• Broken toe – pain, bruising and swelling after hurting your toe

Wear wide, flat shoes with a soft sole. Flat shoes help to take pressure away from your big toe and create more space to help relieve your bunion pain.

Bunion pads (soft pads that go over your bunion) or shoe insoles help to ease painful bunion pressure.

Apply an ice pack wrapped in a tea towel to the affected area when you can. This will help to ease the pain and help to reduce the swelling.

Take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help reduce the pain and the inflammation.

Try losing weight if you are overweight. Being overweight can put a lot of pressure on your feet, which can lead to creating bunions.

Wear a bunion splint at night to help gradually push the toe back into its normal alignment. This will not get rid of your bunion but rather help with the positioning of your toe.

If the pain in your bunion does not go away, the only way to get rid of them is through bunion surgery.

Bunion surgery is called an osteotomy, which usually takes less than an hour and is usually done under general anaesthetic.

The surgery is undertaken by making a small cut in the skin over your big toe, cutting or scraping away the bunion and then returning the toe bone to its correct position using metal screws or staples put under your skin. These will often be left in the toe permanently.

Unfortunately, bunions can sometimes naturally come back even after surgery.
• None Make sure your home is crutch friendly before you leave for your operation, moving any furniture to create more space to move around in. Also, make sure everything you need is within reach.
• None Arrange for someone to take you home after the surgery and help you out the first few days.
• None Stock up on easy to make meals like tin.ned or frozen food.
• None Before your operation your doctor may ask you not to eat or drink to avoid any complications while you’re under general anaesthetic.
• None If you are a smoker, try to stop before the surgery as smoking can put you at risk of getting a wound infection and slow down your recovery rate.

You will usually be given crutches after your surgery and you may be wearing a splint, plaster cast or special shoe.

To help with your recovery:
• None Try to avoid being on your feet for too long for at least 2 weeks
• None Do not drive for at least 6 to 8 weeks
• None Avoid sports for up to 6 months

Once you have recovered you may see some differences in your big toe, it might be weaker or stiffer than before, it may not be perfectly straight and there’s a chance you may have to keep wearing wide, comfy shoes. From the surgery you may still feel sore and you may have swelling in your foot which can take up to six months to a year to reduce.

579,"Ever wondered why the Deep State is behaving “strangely” lately? No matter where you look, the Deep State is struggling to preserve its privileged position across the entire societal spectrum. Whether in the realm of economics, geopolitics, military, or even in the realm of exopolitics, they are losing control, big time.

 In short, it is experiencing sheer panic.

As scheduled, the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE) started entertaining investors for its listed crude oil futures for a total of 23 overseas brokerage. In just a week, it already has a total of 278,234 transactions, worth 115.92 billion yuan.

 China is currently the top energy user, and it is only fitting that it must dictate where it wants to go as far as the currency to use in its oil purchases from here on. This, of course, spells doom for the warmongering Petrodollar industry.

 No, this is just a shift between two elements of the same world order. That is absolutely wrong. In China today, there’s an ongoing construction of 33 highly advanced nuclear power plants, and its intermediate end goal is to export turnkey power plants around the world, at a price that only China could offer.Even Donald Trump is forcing China to drink its more expensive hydrocarbons, hence the tariffs on Chinese steel. But the US has only shot itself in the foot, as the latter is much cheaper that the local counterparts. Why is that?

 China is not playing on the same scarcity-based economic game of the West.

 

 It wants to show the other side that there’s a better way to run the planet for everyone’s benefit. It is wise enough to understand that the only way it can protect itself is to empower other nations on the planet by way of large scale development and the massive establishments of free energy systems via the peaceful use of nuclear power.

The British Empire is not happy with the latest defeat of its terror group in Ghouta Syria.

 

 About 6,000 CIA employed militants got a safe passage again towards Idlib. But one journalist took it upon himself to confront some of them and question the wisdom of their senseless actions.

 The militants were offered reconciliation by the Syrian government, but they refused it and chose instead to relocate themselves to Idlib, where they can be unified with the other defeated CIA stooges.

 

 Highly volatile Trump, on the other hand, is hinting that the US is leaving Syria soon.

 Clap, clap, clap for Trump. But really, the damage done in Syria cannot be undone with just one statement. Not to mention the fact that he just signed the highest Pentagon budget eve in his entire history, a few weeks ago.

 

 The latest anti-Trump British coup attempt using Cambridge Analytica psyop is not working either.

Childish Behaviour from An Old Empire

Back in the UK, the immaturity in world affairs is manifested in the wanton use of its intelligence department to initiate poorly executed anti-Russian false flag, i.e. poisoning its own Russian asset, Sergei Skripal, and blame it on Russia.

 This was followed by the massive EU and US expulsion of Russian diplomats, which is in some ways a huge improvement considering that more than a year back, they were actually assassinating them, openly and otherwise.

 As of late, the Russians have responded with their own proportionate diplomatic expulsion of Western diplomats, due in large part to the latter’s failure to show evidence relevant to the Skripal poisoning case, and the UK’s refusal to cooperate in its investigation.

 The British Empire’s desperation continues with the unannounced and unwarranted raid of one Aeroflot commercial airliner, and with the shutting down of Julian Assange’s internet access.

 The Swedish government has no criminal case against the Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange, and therefore, the Empire has nothing to pin down the activist with. What crime is there when all that Julian Assange is doing is just what mainstream journalists worth their salt would have done, i.e. unearth and publish government wrongdoings?

 This major economic lift is coupled with technology transfer that will a profound impact on the lives of the local population. Compare that to the shallow rock concerts for Africa, where the proceeds went only to the pockets of those who run the shady and bogus humanitarian NGOs.

 All that the Western critics could do is to watch these developments, and malign China that it is only after the exploitation of the recipient’s natural resources, like the West is doing for last 500 years.

 No, China’s participation in the construction of basic infrastructures in Africa is to make the entire continent truly independent from Western exploitation instead. That is a far cry from the Western regime change, war, and biochemical attacks against the Africans.

 The United States of America needs to remember also that in its infancy as a republic, it was China which financed its early economic development, with the same railroad constructions across the continent, using hardworking Chinese labor that in the American history books were labeled as slaves.

 It is so good to watch that in Africa right now, they are already talking about how to intercourse with China through economic terms,

 

 … rather than using their knowledge in mathematics counting dead bodies by Western injected wars. Remember how the Deep State controlled UN responded to the Rwanda genocide in 1994.

 Who triggered that event if not the Western intelligence assets in the region?

 As it stands today, the East is tired of dealing with the immaturity and exceptionalism of the West, and it is forging ahead with globalwide development, with or without, Western participation. The West is not in a position anymore to dictate the terms by which mankind ascends towards shared prosperity.

 

 

 The privileged position of the Parasitic Western Elite will become irrelevant soon, as their hosts gain more knowledge on how to decontaminate, detoxify and deconstruct the imaginary prison cells built around them.

 

 There’s never been a theoretical and physical limits to what the human being can do. The established, dogmatic limitations in Science are exactly where the Western hegemony derives its own power. But the combined scientific achievements of the RIC Alliance between Russia, Iran and China, have effectively neutralized that.

350,"What ever happened to quality science reporting in the mainstream media? Why do so many journalists seem to simply accept press releases as fact? Are qualifications no longer relevant when it comes to journalistic scrutiny of science? Perhaps there’s no longer any scrutiny? Let’s be clear: there is NO Yeti!

The people claiming there is such a creature have no idea about science or the evidence that would be needed to convince scientists that a Yeti, or Bigfoot, or Yowie, or what ever you call it, exists!

This week I learned from Sydney’s Daily Telegraph, the ABC, the UK’s Mail and Telegraph newspapers and the Huffington Post (no less) that a Russian scientist is to be supported in his Bigfoot-hunting efforts by an international team specialising in human evolution.

I checked my calendar to see if it was April 1, and not October 6, as I had (mistakenly) thought. No, October. This story must be real. Not again, I thought.

The 82-year-old Russian heading the project, Igor Burstev – apparently “Dr” Burstev – has convinced himself, local authorities, and apparently plenty of journalists, that the Yeti is real. Burstev even claims the Yeti is a relic population of Neandertals.

And a number of sometimes quite respectable news outlets have been sucked in with this nonsense.

Who are these “international scientists” who are going to find the Yeti? We have been given no names, nor credentials, nor institutions they belong to. I suspect, like so many of the so-called climate-change deniers, they are frauds.

Is there a chance the Yeti might exist? Yes, there’s a chance, just as with so many phenomena we scientists think about. It’s possible. From time to time, a new species of mammal, even primate, is described in some remote area largely unexplored by scientists.

But based on the evidence presented in favour of its existence, the Yeti looks like a very poor hoax to me. Why are there no proper photographs of this creature? Oh, of course – the people who have seen it were too scared to look away and pick up their cameras in case the Yeti disappeared from view.

All of the claimed photographs or video footage I have seen are completely bogus. I could do a better job myself with a gorilla costume from a party shop, a good camera, and photo-editing software.

Why do they always have ridiculously large footprints that look like some off-course camel train passed through snow-swept Siberia?

A few facts: the Neandertals, our closet evolutionary relative, with whom we shared an ancestor 400-500,000 years ago, went extinct 25-30,000 years ago.

They had a body mass of around 75 kilograms (on average) and stood about 162 centimetres tall (on average). We can estimate these things with good accuracy from their bones.

I’m about 75 kilograms, but a lot taller than 162 centimetres. Yet my foot is size eight, about average for an Australian male.

Why the big foot? Lack of imagination by the hoaxers, I suppose. Or lack of knowledge of human anatomy and the human fossil record, more likely.

Oh, and guys, they had five toes like we do, not four, as seems mostly to be the case in your fake photos. Try referring to a good anatomy textbook for starters.

When our ancestors left Africa, 60-70,000 years ago, they happily interbred with the Neandertals. In fact, all of us alive today whose ancestry is Asian, Aboriginal Australian, European, Pacific Islander or Native American, share DNA with them. Up to 6% of our DNA is in fact the result of our ancestors having shagged them!

Far from being bushy-haired, large-toothed, stoop-shouldered, and rather large-footed like the Yeti, Neandertals looked an awful lot like us. Probably not very hairy; certainly with small canine teeth; and hell, they even had nice posture – not like some creature that has spent his working life hunched over a computer writing about hare-brained nonsense like the existence of mythical beings living today in Siberia …

So I ask, where’s the evidence for living Neandertals? If anyone has it, we’d really love to see it. Forget those broken bits of fossil bones and teeth we anthropologists have to work with to study our evolution. We could do real biology! With living creatures!

220,"“Hate speech has been with us for a long time,” UN Under-Secretary-General for Communications and Public Information Cristina Gallach told a symposium on the issue at UN Headquarters in New York, urging citizens worldwide who come across hate speech on social media to forcefully counter it.

“We will never forget the slaughter of over 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus during a brief three month period in Rwanda in 1994. We will never forget either the six million Jews plus five million others who perished because of one hateful vision,” she said.

“Today, however, more than ever, individuals are using hate speech to foment clashes between civilizations in the name of religion. Their goal is to radicalize young boys and girls, to get them to see the world in black and white, good versus evil, and get them to embrace a path of violence as the only way forward.”

Both Ms. Gallach and Nassir Abdulaziz Al–Nasser, High Representative for the UN Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC), the symposium's host, stressed that the “loudspeakers for hate” have been amplified exponentially with the explosion of new means of communication beyond the traditional media, with Facebook and Twitter providing immediate worldwide access.

“We have a big problem on our hands,” Ms. Gallach said. “The world has witnessed this very recently in Paris, where, at last count, 130 people have died at the hands of nine young men who heeded the [Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL] call for violence and succumbed to hate speech.”

She called for passage and enforcement of laws prohibiting incitement of hatred or violence, and the use of communications to establish a counter-message.

“We must monitor social media and quickly respond to hate speech,” Ms. Gallach stressed. “Of course, in an age when Facebook has over 1.5 billion monthly active users, or Twitter has over 300 million users, monitoring might be almost an impossible task, but we can achieve this with the involvement of citizens of the world, who are going to be our crucial partners in combatting hate speech.”

Underscoring that the battle is a collective responsibility, not only for Member States, but for everyone, including the media, she highlighted corporations as crucial partners with the task of deleting content inciting violence or hatred.

Mr. Al-Nasser also noted the role played by new media. “We see how radical groups have hijacked these new media platforms and used [them] as an advocacy tool for their extremist ideologies, and inciting violence and hatred,” he said.

“In doing so, they have assaulted not only individuals, but also global values representing the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. On the other hand, we see those who also use information technology to re-inforce stereotypes, stigmatization and demonization against certain race, faith, or sexual orientation.

“That being said, our next goal should be winning the battle of ideas,” he stressed, citing the use of hate speech against migrants and minority communities blaming them for a nation's problems.

1091,"One of America’s most famous criminals, Jesse James, is shot to death by fellow gang member Bob Ford, who betrayed James for reward money. For 16 years, Jesse and his brother, Frank, committed robberies and murders throughout the Midwest. Detective magazines and pulp novels glamorized the James gang, turning them into mythical Robin Hoods who were driven to crime by unethical landowners and bankers. In reality, Jesse James was a ruthless killer who stole only for himself.

The teenage James brothers joined up with southern guerrilla leaders when the Civil War broke out. Both participated in massacres of settlers and troops affiliated with the North. After the war was over, the quiet farming life of the James brothers’ youth no longer seemed enticing, and the two turned to crime. Jesse’s first bank robbery occurred on February 13, 1866, in Liberty, Missouri.

Over the next couple of years, the James brothers became the suspects in several bank robberies throughout western Missouri. However, locals were sympathetic to ex-southern guerrillas and vouched for the brothers. Throughout the late 1860s and early 1870s, the James gang robbed only a couple banks a year, otherwise keeping a low profile.

In 1873, the James gang got into the train robbery game. During one such robbery, the gang declined to take any money or valuables from southerners. The train robberies brought out the Pinkerton Detective Agency, employed to bring the James gang to justice. However, the Pinkerton operatives’ botched attempt to kill James left a woman and her child injured and elicited public sympathy for Jesse and Frank James.

The James gang suffered a setback in 1876 when they raided the town of Northfield, Minnesota. The Younger brothers, cousins of the James brothers, were shot and wounded during the brazen midday robbery. After running off in a different direction from Jesse and Frank, the Younger brothers were captured by a large posse and later sentenced to life in prison. Jesse and Frank, the only members of the gang to escape successfully, headed to Tennessee to hide out.

After spending a few quiet years farming, Jesse organized a new gang. Charlie and Robert Ford were on the fringe of the new gang, but they disliked Jesse intensely and decided to kill him for the reward money. On April 3, while Jesse’s mother made breakfast, the new gang met to hear Jesse’s plan for the next robbery. When Jesse turned his back to adjust a picture on the wall, Bob Ford shot him several times in the back.

His tombstone reads, “Jesse W. James, Died April 3, 1882, Aged 34 years, 6 months, 28 days, Murdered by a traitor and a coward whose name is not worthy to appear here.”

1182,"Pictures of a ""Yeti footprint"" the Indian Army posted on social media triggered a barrage of jokes on Tuesday.

""For the first time, an #IndianArmy Moutaineering Expedition Team has sited Mysterious Footprints of mythical beast 'Yeti',"" an apparently serious — though misspelled — tweet on the army's official account said Monday, alongside three images of prints in the snow.

It added the ""elusive snowman has only been sighted at Makalu-Barun National Park in the past"", referring to footprints reported by British explorer Eric Shipton in 1951 on the west side of Mount Everest.

According to folklore, the abominable snowman lives in the Himalayas but no proof of the enormous creature has ever been produced.

Social media users were quick to jump on the Indian military for its tweet.

""With all due respect, institutions such as yours should be more responsible and careful before going ahead and declaring the sighting of any footprints as 'Yeti's'!"", said Kushal Prajapati.

""There's been lots of research done on Bigfoot/Yeti (including sighting/footprints) with none proving its existence,"" he added.

""Seriously disappointing to see Army propagating such foolish myths into reality. Expected better from you guys,"" said another comment.

Several Twitter observers asked why there was only one footprint when the beast would probably have had two feet.

One Twitter user took the opportunity to jab the Indian Army over another dubious claim, about a much more serious topic. In February, amid soaring tension with neighbor Pakistan, India's military claimed to have carried out an airstrike on Pakistani territory that it said had destroyed a terrorist training camp in the Balakot area. However Pakistan insisted the missiles had fallen into an empty forest hillside in the Himalayas, and there was never any evidence the strike had destroyed anything but trees.

""Foot-print suggests that this Yeti is one-legged. Looks like he lost his other leg in Balakote air strike,"" mocked a Twitter user Shah Faesal.

Others, were more forgiving, though still tongue-in-cheek.

""Congratulations, we are always proud of you. salutes to the #IndianArmy Mountaineering Expedition Team,"" wrote Tarun Vijay, a leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.

But Vijay said the snowman should not be referred to as ""a beast.""

The army said the footprints measured 32 inches by 15 inches (81 centimeters by 38) and were spotted by a team on April 9 close to the Makalu Base Camp, an isolated area on the Nepal-China frontier.

An army official told AFP that pictures were released to ""excite a bit of a scientific temper.""

""We will share whatever we get with the domain experts to analyse. We will be contacting the team on the satphone in the evening for more details about it. The idea is to find out more, to look for an answer,"" the official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The yeti is traditionally described as an ape-like creature, taller than a human, that lives in the Himalayas, Siberia, and parts of Central and East Asia.

Most scientists have written the creature off as a centuries-old myth originating in Tibet.

29,"""An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin."" —Proverb 21:4

JARS OF CLAY names Jimmy Hendrix and the Beatles as their inspiration (Dann Denny, “Christian Rock,” Sunday Herald Times, Bloomington, Ind., Feb. 8, 1998). The lead guitarist for Jars of Clay is said to be a “Beatles fanatic” (Christian News, Dec. 8, 1997).

Please understand that I don't condemn anyone, for the Bible condemns all of us as guilty, dirty, rotten, hell-deserving sinners. My salvation solely rests in Christ's righteousness, because of the precious blood that He gave for our sins. My intention is not to be unkind; but rather, to expose the falsehood of so-called ""Christian rock.""

When asked by ChristianityToday to list their musical influences, Jars of Clay members “listed no Christian artists” (Christianity Today, Nov. 15, 1999). Jars of Clay performs Ozzy Osbourne’s “Crazy Train” during their concerts. Osbourne is the filthy-mouthed former lead singer for the occultic rock group Black Sabbath. Ozzy Osbourne, has featured Pan on all of his recent album covers (2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008). Sadly, Ozzy is bound for Hell. The Rock 'N' Roll industry is infamous for worshipping Pan, who is the very embodiment of Rock music. Pan represents Satan, which is what the ever-so-popular Satanic hand sign shows, allegiance to the Devil.

Though members of Black Sabbath today claim it was all done in innocence and “fun,” they promoted occultic themes through their music and concerts, including upside down crosses and altar calls for Satan. They blasphemed Jesus Christ and railed against the authority of the God of the Bible. Osbourne has almost died several times because of his outrageous drug abuse and alcoholism. He has bitten the head off of a live bat in concert. He has dressed in women’s clothing and stripped off most of his clothes during concerts. He is deeply scarred by his savage lifestyle and maintains a semblance of normalcy today through the drug Prozac. Ozzy Osbourne's works are of the Devil.

Can you image... a professed Christian group that sings Ozzy Osbourne's hellish music? Just as shocking and tragic is the fact that Christianity Today (CT) magazine promotes Jars of Clay. Why? Do you want to see some freaks?... then look at the website for Jars of Clay. Is this what Christianity has come to? Why would Christianity Today promote such worldly garbage? To no surprise, Christianity Today promotes Harry Potter's witchcraft. CT is also pro-homosexual.

This is Christianity. There is NOTHING even remotely ""Christian"" about the band JARS OF CLAY, and ChristianityToday is apostate. Jars of Clay play the Devil's rock-n-roll, and ChristianityToday sinfully promotes them. It should be renamed to ApostasyToday.

Do you think Jesus Christ is pleased with the worldly, Heavy Metal rock-n-roll of Jars of Clay? No way!!! The Bible warns in 2nd Corinthians 6:14-17... ""Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord..."" It is sinful to hobnob with the Devil's crowd. You can't eat at the Devil's table without getting food poisoning! You can't play with fire without getting burned. DON'T be deceived my friend, ALL rock music is straight out of the pits of Hell. Again, I am not judging anyone; but rather, the apostate music itself.

Shortly before Billy Graham had them perform in his crusades, JARS OF CLAY had ""recorded for an R-rated film loaded with 'live-in' lovers, nudity, graphic violence, and 83 obscenities.[1] The lead vocalist from this band said: ""We don't want to be called a 'Christian band' because it is a turn-off. Jerry Huffman perceptively added: ""Don't worry, we would not accuse it of such.""

Certainly, many believers love the world's music; but we must never attempt to justify it. There's a big difference between a believer who struggles with Rock music, verses someone who tries to say that there's nothing wrong with Rock music. 1st John 2:17 tells us that this world will one day pass away and everything in it (2nd Peter 3:10). The members of STRYPER love secular rock music. In a 1995 interview, Michael Sweet, who was the lead singer for Stryper, said: “I’m a fan of all that stuff from the ‘80s.Groups like Bon Jovi, Van Halen, and Aerosmith. Musically, I like a lot of that stuff, but back when I was a kid what I grew up listening to ranged from Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Fats Domino all the way to groups like Three Dog Night. Credence [Clearwater Revival] was one of my favorite bands and a group called Bad Company. I just loved them and Elvis, of course” (CCM Magazine, November 1995). There's not a dime's difference between the world's rock music, and so-called Christian rock (and Christian rockers admit it!). Some of DC TALK’S musical role models are the Beatles, David Bowie, and The Police, all of which are wicked secular rock groups. dc Talk’s album “Free at Last” contains a song titled “Jesus Is Just Alright,” which was first sung by the Byrds (the song was later covered by the Doobie Brothers; a “doobie” is a marijuana joint). DC Talk’s Kevin Smith admits that he listens to mostly secular rock music (Flint Michigan Journal, March 15, 1996, B19). dc Talk opened its “Jesus Freak” concerts with the Beatles’ song “Help.” They also perform Jimi Hendrix’s Purple Haze. Hendrix was a drug-crazed New Age occultist. Toward the end of their concerts dc Talk plays the rock song “All Apologies” by the wicked secular rock group Nirvana, formerly led by Kurt Cobain. Terry Watkins notes: “Kurt Cobain is one of the worst Antichrist, blasphemers since John Lennon. Kurt Cobain decorated his home with blood-splattered baby dolls hanging by their necks! The inside of Nirvana’s album In Utero, which is the album dc Talk got ‘All Apologies’ from, has pictures of chopped up babies! Cobain ran around his neighborhood spray-painting, ‘ABORT CHRIST’ and ‘GOD IS GAY.’ Cobain’s first band was called ‘Fecal Matter.’ Cobain killed himself a couple of years ago” (Dr. Watkins, Christian Rock: Blessing or Blasphemy?) Jars of Clay has a less commercial sound that appeals to ""alternative rock"" fans drawn to groups like R.E.M. or Matchbox Twenty. The band has enjoyed some crossover success in the secular market. So much for being a so-called “Christian” group! Their first album went double platinum with astonishing sales of over 2 million copies (making it one of the best-selling albums of 1996). The band’s third disc was chosen by Playboy as Album of the Month. This is just sickening! These phonies call themselves “Christians” and yet sing the Devil's music, open concerts for Satanist Ozzy Osbourne, and are praised by the smutty PLAYBOY magazine. Jars of Clay are of the Devil. Birds of a feather flock together. AMY GRANT says, “I love to hear Billy Joel, Kenny Loggins and the Doobie Brothers” (Time, March 11, 1985). Amy’s album House of Love includes the environmental-mother-earth song, “Big Yellow Taxi,” by new-age-priestess Joni Mitchell (Ibid.). Mitchell is infamous for her open relationship with a spirit she calls “Art.” Obviously she is communing with demons, and it is unconscionable for Amy Grant to be promoting Mitchell’s music to Christian young people. I'm not judging Amy Grant, for I like Billy Joel's music too; but I'm not going to dare say that there's nothing wrong with it. God deliver our young people from these materialistic, worldly, deceitful, wicked imposters who EXPLOIT the name of Jesus to make a buck and corrupt America's youth. The world has no place in the New Testament Church. This means that Relient K, Toby Mac, Avalon, Jeremy Camp, Dead Poetic, Demon Hunter, Newsboys, Whitecross, MxPx, Third Day, Passion, Delirious, Bride, The Almost, Disciple, Kutless, Inhale/Exhale, PFR, Emery, Robert Pierre, Chris Tomlin, Marsha Stevens, Further Seems Forever, Switchfoot, Soul P., New Life Worship, DC talk, Echoing Angels, Matt Redman, Katinas, Michael W. Smith, Lincoln Brewster, GRITS, Geoff Moore The Distance, Thousand Foot Krutch, Steven Curtis Chapman, Mercy Me, and Jars of Clay... HAVE NO BUSINESS BRINGING THEIR WORKS OF DARKNESS INTO ANY NEW TESTAMENT CHURCH! To be a friend of the world is to be the enemy of God (James 4:4). ""Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever."" —1st John 2:15-17",conspiracy,C02432,big.foot; elvis.presley
895,"Rather coolly, the admissions officer asked him what it was. “The moon,” he said. He had picked this moment to render his very first representational drawing, and our hopes rose. But her jaw was locked in an icy and inscrutable smile. Later, at a crowded open house for prospective families, a hedge-fund manager from a former Soviet republic told me about a good public school in the area that accepted a high percentage of children with disabilities. As insurance against private school, he was planning to grab a spot at this public school by gaming the special-needs system—which, he added, wasn’t hard to do. Wanting to distance myself from this scheme, I waved my hand at the roomful of parents desperate to cough up $30,000 for preschool and said, “It’s all a scam.” I meant the whole business of basing admissions on interviews with 2-year-olds. The hedge-fund manager pointed out that if he reported my words to the admissions officer, he’d have one less competitor to worry about. When the rejection letter arrived, I took it hard as a comment on our son, until my wife informed me that the woman with the frozen smile had actually been interviewing us. We were the ones who’d been rejected. We consoled ourselves that the school wasn’t right for our family, or we for it. It was a school for amoral finance people. At a second private school, my wife watched intently with other parents behind a one-way mirror as our son engaged in group play with other toddlers, their lives secured or ruined by every share or shove. He was put on the wait list. Places at the preschool were awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. At the front of the line, parents were lying in sleeping bags. They had spent the night outside. The system that dominates our waking hours, commands our unthinking devotion, and drives us, like orthodox followers of an exacting faith, to extraordinary, even absurd feats of exertion is not democracy, which often seems remote and fragile. It’s meritocracy—the system that claims to reward talent and effort with a top-notch education and a well-paid profession, its code of rigorous practice and generous blessings passed down from generation to generation. The pressure of meritocracy made us apply to private schools when our son was 2—not because we wanted him to attend private preschool, but because, in New York City, where we live, getting him into a good public kindergarten later on would be even harder, and if we failed, by that point most of the private-school slots would be filled. As friends who’d started months earlier warned us, we were already behind the curve by the time he drew his picture of the moon. We were maximizing options—hedging, like the finance guy, like many families we knew—already tracing the long line that would lead to the horizon of our son’s future. The mood of meritocracy is anxiety—the low-grade panic when you show up a few minutes late and all the seats are taken. New York City, with its dense population, stratified social ladder, and general pushiness, holds a fun-house mirror up to meritocracy. Only New York would force me to wake up early one Saturday morning in February, put on my parka and wool hat, and walk half a mile in the predawn darkness to register our son, then just 17 months old, for nursery school. I arrived to find myself, at best, the 30th person in a line that led from the locked front door of the school up the sidewalk. Registration was still two hours off, and places would be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. At the front of the line, parents were lying in sleeping bags. They had spent the night outside.

The school’s progressive pedagogy had fostered a wonderfully intimate sense of each child as a complex individual. But progressive politics meant thinking in groups. When our son was in third or fourth grade, students began to form groups that met to discuss issues based on identity—race, sexuality, disability. I understood the solidarity that could come from these meetings, but I also worried that they might entrench differences that the school, by its very nature, did so much to reduce. Other, less diverse schools in New York, including elite private ones, had taken to dividing their students by race into consciousness-raising “affinity groups.” I knew several mixed-race families that transferred their kids out of one such school because they were put off by the relentless focus on race. Our son and his friends, whose classroom study included slavery and civil rights, hardly ever discussed the subject of race with one another. The school already lived what it taught. The bathroom crisis hit our school the same year our son took the standardized tests. A girl in second grade had switched to using male pronouns, adopted the initial Q as a first name, and begun dressing in boys’ clothes. Q also used the boys’ bathroom, which led to problems with other boys. Q’s mother spoke to the principal, who, with her staff, looked for an answer. They could have met the very real needs of students like Q by creating a single-stall bathroom—the one in the second-floor clinic would have served the purpose. Instead, the school decided to get rid of boys’ and girls’ bathrooms altogether. If, as the city’s Department of Education now instructed, schools had to allow students to use the bathroom of their self-identified gender, then getting rid of the labels would clear away all the confusion around the bathroom question. A practical problem was solved in conformity with a new idea about identity. Within two years, almost every bathroom in the school, from kindergarten through fifth grade, had become gender-neutral. Where signs had once said boys and girls, they now said students. Kids would be conditioned to the new norm at such a young age that they would become the first cohort in history for whom gender had nothing to do with whether they sat or stood to pee. All that biology entailed—curiosity, fear, shame, aggression, pubescence, the thing between the legs—was erased or wished away. The school didn’t inform parents of this sudden end to an age-old custom, as if there were nothing to discuss. Parents only heard about it when children started arriving home desperate to get to the bathroom after holding it in all day. Girls told their parents mortifying stories of having a boy kick open their stall door. Boys described being afraid to use the urinals. Our son reported that his classmates, without any collective decision, had simply gone back to the old system, regardless of the new signage: Boys were using the former boys’ rooms, girls the former girls’ rooms. This return to the familiar was what politicians call a “commonsense solution.” It was also kind of heartbreaking. As children, they didn’t think to challenge the new adult rules, the new adult ideas of justice. Instead, they found a way around this difficulty that the grown-ups had introduced into their lives. It was a quiet plea to be left alone. When parents found out about the elimination of boys’ and girls’ bathrooms, they showed up en masse at a PTA meeting. The parents in one camp declared that the school had betrayed their trust, and a woman threatened to pull her daughter out of the school. The parents in the other camp argued that gender labels—and not just on the bathroom doors—led to bullying and that the real problem was the patriarchy. One called for the elimination of urinals. It was a minor drama of a major cultural upheaval. The principal, who seemed to care more about the testing opt-out movement than the bathroom issue, explained her financial constraints and urged the formation of a parent-teacher committee to resolve the matter. After six months of stalemate, the Department of Education intervened: One bathroom would be gender-neutral. In politics, identity is an appeal to authority—the moral authority of the oppressed: I am what I am, which explains my view and makes it the truth. The politics of identity starts out with the universal principles of equality, dignity, and freedom, but in practice it becomes an end in itself—often a dead end, a trap from which there’s no easy escape and maybe no desire for escape. Instead of equality, it sets up a new hierarchy that inverts the old, discredited one—a new moral caste system that ranks people by the oppression of their group identity. It makes race, which is a dubious and sinister social construct, an essence that defines individuals regardless of agency or circumstance—as when Representative Ayanna Pressley said, “We don’t need any more brown faces that don’t want to be a brown voice; we don’t need black faces that don’t want to be a black voice.” At times the new progressivism, for all its up-to-the-minuteness, carries a whiff of the 17th century, with heresy hunts and denunciations of sin and displays of self-mortification. The atmosphere of mental constriction in progressive milieus, the self-censorship and fear of public shaming, the intolerance of dissent—these are qualities of an illiberal politics. I asked myself if I was moving to the wrong side of a great moral cause because its tone was too loud, because it shook loose what I didn’t want to give up. It took me a long time to see that the new progressivism didn’t just carry my own politics further than I liked. It was actually hostile to principles without which I don’t believe democracy can survive. Liberals are always slow to realize that there can be friendly, idealistic people who have little use for liberal values. IN 2016 two obsessions claimed our family—Hamilton and the presidential campaign. We listened and sang along to the Hamilton soundtrack every time we got in the car, until the kids had memorized most of its brilliant, crowded, irresistible libretto. Our son mastered Lafayette’s highest-velocity rap, and in our living room he and his sister acted out the climactic duel between Hamilton and Burr. The musical didn’t just teach them this latest version of the revolution and the early republic. It filled their world with the imagined past, and while the music was playing, history became more real than the present. Our daughter, who was about to start kindergarten at our son’s school, wholly identified with the character of Hamilton—she fought his battles, made his arguments, and denounced his enemies. Every time he died she wept. Hamilton and the campaign had a curious relation in our lives. The first acted as a disinfectant to the second, cleansing its most noxious effects, belying its most ominous portents. Donald Trump could sneer at Mexicans and rail against Muslims and kick dirt on everything decent and good, but the American promise still breathed whenever the Puerto Rican Hamilton and the black Jefferson got into a rap battle over the national bank. When our daughter saw pictures of the actual Founding Fathers, she was shocked and a little disappointed that they were white. The only president our kids had known was black. Their experience gave them no context for Trump’s vicious brand of identity politics, which was inflaming the other kinds. We wanted them to believe that America was better than Trump, and Hamilton kept that belief in the air despite the accumulating gravity of facts. Our son, who started fourth grade that fall, had dark premonitions about the election, but when the Access Hollywood video surfaced in October, he sang Jefferson’s gloating line about Hamilton’s sex scandal: “Never gonna be president now!” The morning after the election, the kids cried. They cried for people close to us, Muslims and immigrants who might be in danger, and perhaps they also cried for the lost illusion that their parents could make things right. Our son lay on the couch and sobbed inconsolably until we made him go to the bus stop. The next time we were in the car, we automatically put on Hamilton. When “Dear Theodosia” came on, and Burr and Hamilton sang to their newborn children, “If we lay a strong enough foundation, we’ll pass it on to you, we’ll give the world to you, and you’ll blow us all away,” it was too much for me and my wife. We could no longer feel the romance of the young republic. It was a long time before we listened to Hamilton again. A few weeks after the election, our daughter asked if Trump could break our family apart. She must have gotten the idea from overhearing a conversation about threats to undocumented immigrants. We told her that we were lucky—we had rights as citizens that he couldn’t take away. I decided to sit down with the kids and read the Bill of Rights together. Not all of it made sense, but they got the basic idea—the president wasn’t King George III, the Constitution was stronger than Trump, certain principles had not been abolished—and they seemed reassured. Since then it has become harder to retain faith in these truths. Our daughter said that she hated being a child, because she felt helpless to do anything. The day after the inauguration, my wife took her to the Women’s March in Midtown Manhattan. She made a sign that said we have power too, and at the march she sang the one protest song she knew, “We Shall Overcome.” For days afterward she marched around the house shouting, “Show me what democracy looks like!” Our son was less given to joining a cause and shaking his fist. Being older, he also understood the difficulty of the issues better, and they depressed him, because he knew that children really could do very little. He’d been painfully aware of climate change throughout elementary school—first grade was devoted to recycling and sustainability, and in third grade, during a unit on Africa, he learned that every wild animal he loved was facing extinction. “What are humans good for besides destroying the planet?” he asked. Our daughter wasn’t immune to the heavy mood—she came home from school one day and expressed a wish not to be white so that she wouldn’t have slavery on her conscience. It did not seem like a moral victory for our children to grow up hating their species and themselves. We decided to cut down on the political talk around them. It wasn’t that we wanted to hide the truth or give false comfort—they wouldn’t have let us even if we’d tried. We just wanted them to have their childhood without bearing the entire weight of the world, including the new president we had allowed into office. We owed our children a thousand apologies. The future looked awful, and somehow we expected them to fix it. Did they really have to face this while they were still in elementary school? I can imagine the retort—the rebuke to everything I’ve written here: Your privilege has spared them. There’s no answer to that—which is why it’s a potent weapon—except to say that identity alone should neither uphold nor invalidate an idea, or we’ve lost the Enlightenment to pure tribalism. Adults who draft young children into their cause might think they’re empowering them and shaping them into virtuous people (a friend calls the Instagram photos parents post of their woke kids “selflessies”). In reality the adults are making themselves feel more righteous, indulging another form of narcissistic pride, expiating their guilt, and shifting the load of their own anxious battles onto children who can’t carry the burden, because they lack the intellectual apparatus and political power. Our goal shouldn’t be to tell children what to think. The point is to teach them how to think so they can grow up to find their own answers. I wished that our son’s school would teach him civics. By age 10 he had studied the civilizations of ancient China, Africa, the early Dutch in New Amsterdam, and the Mayans. He learned about the genocide of Native Americans and slavery. But he was never taught about the founding of the republic. He didn’t learn that conflicting values and practical compromises are the lifeblood of self-government. He was given no context for the meaning of freedom of expression, no knowledge of the democratic ideas that Trump was trashing or of the instruments with which citizens could hold those in power accountable. Our son knew about the worst betrayals of democracy, including the one darkening his childhood, but he wasn’t taught the principles that had been betrayed. He got his civics from Hamilton. The teaching of civics has dwindled since the 1960s—a casualty of political polarization, as the left and the right each accuse the other of using the subject for indoctrination—and with it the public’s basic knowledge about American government. In the past few years, civics has been making a comeback in certain states. As our son entered fifth grade, in the first year of the Trump presidency, no subject would have been more truly empowering. “If you fail seventh grade you fail middle school, if you fail middle school you fail high school, if you fail high school you fail college, if you fail college you fail life.” Every year, instead of taking tests, students at the school presented a “museum” of their subject of study, a combination of writing and craftwork on a particular topic. Parents came in, wandered through the classrooms, read, admired, and asked questions of students, who stood beside their projects. These days, called “shares,” were my very best experiences at the school. Some of the work was astoundingly good, all of it showed thought and effort, and the coming-together of parents and kids felt like the realization of everything the school aspired to be. The fifth-grade share, our son’s last, was different. That year’s curriculum included the Holocaust, Reconstruction, and Jim Crow. The focus was on “upstanders”—individuals who had refused to be bystanders to evil and had raised their voices. It was an education in activism, and with no grounding in civics, activism just meant speaking out. At the year-end share, the fifth graders presented dioramas on all the hard issues of the moment—sexual harassment, LGBTQ rights, gun violence. Our son made a plastic-bag factory whose smokestack spouted endangered animals. Compared with previous years, the writing was minimal and the students, when questioned, had little to say. They hadn’t been encouraged to research their topics, make intellectual discoveries, answer potential counterarguments. The dioramas consisted of cardboard, clay, and slogans. Students in New York City public schools have to apply to middle school. They rank schools in their district, six or eight or a dozen of them, in order of preference, and the middle schools rank the students based on academic work and behavior. Then a Nobel Prize–winning algorithm matches each student with a school, and that’s almost always where the student has to go. The city’s middle schools are notoriously weak; in our district, just three had a reputation for being “good.” An education expert near us made a decent living by offering counseling sessions to panic-stricken families. The whole process seemed designed to raise the anxiety of 10-year-olds to the breaking point. “If you fail a math test you fail seventh grade,” our daughter said one night at dinner, looking years ahead. “If you fail seventh grade you fail middle school, if you fail middle school you fail high school, if you fail high school you fail college, if you fail college you fail life.” We were back to the perversions of meritocracy. But the country’s politics had changed dramatically during our son’s six years of elementary school. Instead of hope pendants around the necks of teachers, in one middle-school hallway a picture was posted of a card that said, “Uh-oh! Your privilege is showing. You’ve received this card because your privilege just allowed you to make a comment that others cannot agree or relate to. Check your privilege.” The card had boxes to be marked, like a scorecard, next to “White,” “Christian,” “Heterosexual,” “Able-bodied,” “Citizen.” (Our son struck the school off his list.) This language is now not uncommon in the education world. A teacher in Saratoga Springs, New York, found a “privilege-reflection form” online with an elaborate method of scoring, and administered it to high-school students, unaware that the worksheet was evidently created by a right-wing internet troll—it awarded Jews 25 points of privilege and docked Muslims 50. The middle-school scramble subjected 10- and 11-year-olds to the dictates of meritocracy and democracy at the same time: a furiously competitive contest and a heavy-handed ideology. The two systems don’t coexist so much as drive children simultaneously toward opposite extremes, realms that are equally inhospitable to the delicate, complex organism of a child’s mind. If there’s a relation between the systems, I came to think, it’s this: Wokeness prettifies the success race, making contestants feel better about the heartless world into which they’re pushing their children. Constantly checking your privilege is one way of not having to give it up. On the day acceptance letters arrived at our school, some students wept. One of them was Marcus, who had been matched with a middle school that he didn’t want to attend. His mother went in to talk to an administrator about an appeal. The administrator asked her why Marcus didn’t instead go to the middle school that shared a building with our school, that followed the same progressive approach as ours, and that was one of the worst-rated in the state. Marcus’s mother left in fury and despair. She had no desire for him to go to the middle school upstairs. Our son got into one of the “good” middle schools. Last September he came home from the first day of school and told us that something was wrong. His classmates didn’t look like the kids in his elementary school. We found a pie chart that broke his new school down by race, and it left him stunned. Two-thirds of the students were white or Asian; barely a quarter were black or Latino. Competitive admissions had created a segregated school. His will be the last such class. Two years ago, Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a new initiative to integrate New York City’s schools. Our district, where there are enough white families for integration to be meaningful, was chosen as a test case. Last year a committee of teachers, parents, and activists in the district announced a proposal: Remove the meritocratic hurdle that stands in the way of equality. The proposal would get rid of competitive admissions for middle school—grades, tests, attendance, behavior—which largely accounted for the racial makeup at our son’s new school. In the new system, students would still rank their choices, but the algorithm would be adjusted to produce middle schools that reflect the demography of our district, giving disadvantaged students a priority for 52 percent of the seats. In this way, the district’s middle schools would be racially and economically integrated. De Blasio’s initiative was given the slogan “Equity and Excellence for All.” It tried to satisfy democracy and meritocracy in a single phrase. I went back and forth and back again, and finally decided to support the new plan. My view was gratuitous, since the change came a year too late to affect our son. I would have been sorely tested if chance had put him in the first experimental class. Under the new system, a girl at his former bus stop got matched with her 12th choice, and her parents decided to send her to a charter school. No doubt many other families will leave the public-school system. But I had seen our son flourish by going to an elementary school that looked like the city. I had also seen meritocracy separate out and demoralize children based on their work in fourth grade. “If you fail middle school,” our daughter said, “you fail life.” It was too soon for children’s fates to be decided by an institution that was supposed to serve the public good. Read: Poor kids who believe in meritocracy suffer I wanted the plan to succeed, but I had serious doubts. It came festooned with all the authoritarian excess of the new progressivism. It called for the creation of a new diversity bureaucracy, and its relentless jargon squashed my hope that the authors knew how to achieve an excellent education for all. Instead of teaching civics that faced the complex truths of American democracy, “the curriculum will highlight the vast historical contributions of non-white groups & seek to dispel the many non-truths/lies related to American & World History.” “Excellence” was barely an afterthought in the plan. Of its 64 action items, only one even mentioned what was likely to be the hardest problem: “Provide support for [district] educators in adopting best practices for academically, racially & socioeconomically mixed classrooms.” How to make sure that children of greatly different abilities would succeed, in schools that had long been academically tracked? How to do it without giving up on rigor altogether—without losing the fastest learners? We had faced this problem with our daughter, who was reading far ahead of her grade in kindergarten and begged her teacher for math problems to solve. When the school declined to accommodate her, and our applications to other public schools were unsuccessful, we transferred her to a new, STEM-focused private school rather than risk years of boredom. We regretted leaving the public-school system, and we were still wary of the competitive excesses of meritocracy, but we weren’t willing to abandon it altogether. The Department of Education didn’t seem to be thinking about meritocracy at all. Its entire focus was on achieving diversity, and on rooting out the racism that stood in the way of that. Late in the summer of 2018, a public meeting was called in our district to discuss the integration plan. It was the height of vacation season, but several hundred parents, including me, showed up. Many had just heard about the new plan, which buried the results of an internal poll showing that a majority of parents wanted to keep the old system. We were presented with a slideshow that included a photo of white adults snarling at black schoolchildren in the South in the 1960s—as if only vicious racism could motivate parents to oppose eliminating an admissions system that met superior work with a more challenging placement. Even if the placement was the fruit of a large historical injustice, parents are compromised; a policy that tells them to set aside their children’s needs until that injustice has been remedied is asking for failure. Just in case the implication of racism wasn’t enough to intimidate dissenters, when the presentation ended, and dozens of hands shot up, one of the speakers, a progressive city-council member, announced that he would take no questions. He waved off the uproar that ensued. It was just like the opt-out “education session” my wife had attended: The deal was done. There was only one truth.
• The 9.9 Percent Is the New American Aristocracy
• Americans Have Given Up on Public Schools. That’s a Mistake. De Blasio’s schools chancellor, Richard Carranza, has answered critics of the diversity initiative by calling them out for racism and refusing to let them “silence” him. As part of the initiative, Carranza has mandated anti-bias training for every employee of the school system, at a cost of $23 million. One training slide was titled “White Supremacy Culture.” It included “Perfectionism,” “Individualism,” “Objectivity,” and “Worship of the Written Word” among the white-supremacist values that need to be disrupted. In the name of exposing racial bias, the training created its own kind. The legacy of racism, together with a false meritocracy in America today that keeps children trapped where they are, is the root cause of the inequalities in the city’s schools. But calling out racism and getting rid of objective standards won’t create real equality or close the achievement gap, and might have the perverse effect of making it worse by driving out families of all races who cling to an idea of education based on real merit. If integration is a necessary condition for equality, it isn’t sufficient. Equality is too important to be left to an ideology that rejects universal values. In middle school our son immediately made friends with the same kind of kids who had been his friends in elementary school—outsiders—including Latino boys from the district’s poorest neighborhood. One day he told us about the “N-word passes” that were being exchanged among other boys he knew—a system in which a black kid, bartering for some item, would allow a white kid to use the word. We couldn’t believe such a thing existed, but it did. When one white boy kept using his pass all day long, our son grabbed the imaginary piece of paper and ripped it to shreds. He and his friends heard the official language of moral instruction so often that it became a source of irony and teasing: “Hey, dude, you really need to check your privilege.” When his teacher assigned students to write about how they felt about their identity, letting the class know that whiteness was a source of guilt for her, our son told her that he couldn’t do it. The assignment was too personal, and it didn’t leave enough space for him to describe all that made him who he was. “Isn’t school for learning math and science and reading,” he asked us one day, “not for teachers to tell us what to think about society?” He was responding as kids do when adults keep telling them what to think. He had what my wife called unpoliticized empathy. Watching your children grow up gives you a startlingly vivid image of the world you’re going to leave them. I can’t say I’m sanguine. Some days the image fills me with dread. That pragmatic genius for which Americans used to be known and admired, which included a talent for educating our young—how did it desert us? Now we’re stewing in anxiety and anger, feverish with bad ideas, too absorbed in our own failures to spare our children. But one day the fever will break, and by then they’ll be grown, and they will have to discover for themselves how to live together in a country that gives every child an equal chance.",mainstream,M09c48,big.foot
605,"One of Africa's last remaining giant ""tusker"" elephants has died in Kenya aged 50, the country's wildlife service (KWS) has said.

Big Tim died in Mada area of Amboseli National Park from natural causes, KWS said in a statement on Wednesday.
• The battle against wildlife poachers is increasingly hi-tech

""The celebrated elephant died early on Tuesday morning aged 50,"" the statement said.

He was ""a benevolent, slow-moving preserver of the peace at Amboseli,"" KWS said. ""He was well known and loved throughout Kenya.""

Big Tim's carcass was found at the foot of the snowcapped peak of Kilimanjaro, the Amboseli Trust for Elephants said.

An elephant is technically a ""tusker"" when its ivory tusks are so long that they scrape the ground.

Usually, only old bull elephants grow their tusks long enough to reach this acclaimed status.

But conservationists estimate only a few dozen such animals with tusks that size are now left on the continent due to poaching.

Animals with the biggest ivory and elephants with the heaviest tusks are most at risk from poachers.

Tim was named by researchers who called each elephant in the family herd they were monitoring by the same letter to help identify them; Tim was a member of the ""T"" herd.

The giant pachyderm once roamed outside the national parks into farming lands and had survived poachers and angry farmers.

Vets once treated him for a spear that had gone through his ear and snapped off into his shoulder.

""Our hearts are broken,"" said Wildlife Direct, a Nairobi-based conservation campaign group.

""Tim was one of Africa's very few Super Tuskers, and an incredible elephant whose presence awed and inspired many. He was one of Kenya's National Treasures.""

Big Tim's body is being transported to the Kenyan capital Nairobi, where a taxidermist will preserve it for display at the national museum, KWS said.

Poaching has seen the population of African elephants plunge by 110,000 over the past 10 years to just 415,000 animals, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",mainstream,M0e8ad,big.foot
1195,"Fire personnel are saying the fires destroying tens of thousands of acres in the northern part of the state are like nothing they’ve seen before. They comment in amazement and concern on the ignition metrics, fuel consumption and intense heat being generated by these fires. Could there be a connection between the intentionally sprayed aerosol particulate trails (which contain aluminum and barium) and the intense heat being generated by these fires?

A fire truck moves position as flames from the Rocky fire approach near Clearlake, California

Aluminum is a powerful conductor of electricity and heat. Because it's lighter than copper, it is often used in aircraft to cut down on weight. Electrical contractors use aluminum wire as a substitute for copper because of its lower cost per foot. Remember, nano-sized particles contained in the aerosols are an infinitesimally fine dust. They are a metal, and they do coat the leaves, the duff below the tree canopy and fuel sources on the ground. When this dust ignites, which it does because it is not in its dense form, an un-natural, tremendous quantity of heat is generated. Coupled with the extreme dryness caused by bad actors engineering our drought, and you have the ingredients for catastrophic destructive forces. One would not be going out on a limb by characterizing the unfolding events as a false flag, having been consciously (or unconsciously) engineered ahead of time. If the pseudoscientific thinking behind the geo-engineering were truly scientific, they would have factored ignition effects of aluminum into the equation before deciding to move forward with their plans to drought the state using aluminum, barium and strontium, known desiccants with powerful drying properties.

Where is the governor during all this? He’s signing legislation that will force Californian’s into mandatory vaccinations that science has shown can cause autism and death in children and adults. Parents must now decide whether to compromise their children’s health risks, or bear the expense of private or home schooling. Jerry Brown is also preparing to strip private property rights to water on privately owned lands.

If you think there’s something wrong with this picture, you’re not a conspiracy theorist, you’re conspiracy analyst. Think for a minute about the possibility of continued aerosol activity leading to fresh produce and grape production cut backs. You can see, regardless of the intentions behind the parties geoengineering pseudoscientific nonsense, the entire program to drought the west has no science to support it; that is unless the science is a military strategy of aggression… in which case it makes perfect sense.

The evidence is mounting against the powerful interests behind this epic violation of nature and its balanced forces. There can be no valid argument for what’s been going on in the skies above our heads for the last decade. The point of critical mass has arrived. Pretending it will go away is more than foolish, it's abetting criminal behavior. The public deserves an explanation and it deserves that explanation now.",conspiracy,C00d31,big.foot
265,"The all-male Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo and its antecedents began life in the early 1970s as a balletomanes' jeu d'esprit: witty, informed ballet sendups combined with a poignant fantasy of ballerina glamour. The emphasis then swung to pretty good technical dancing mixed with mostly funny mugging. But the program presented Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater by the Trocks, as they are now known, largely failed to achieve that difficult balance.

The dancers look happier dancing well than goofing up, and the difference was distracting in the opening excerpt from ""Swan Lake."" The humor was still witty, as when a nicely danced solo by Ashley Romanoff-Titwillow's (Joshua Grant) gangly Prince is unexpectedly preserved for history with the flash of a camera operated by his hapless Benno. But Olga Supphozova (Robert Carter), one of the company's most skillful and poignant ballerinas, no longer blends the pyrotechnics and gags as Odette. And her campy, troll-like Glove Seller was an embarrassment in a dimwitted new production of ""Gaîté Parisienne.""

It would probably take the sly sophistication of Peter Anastos, an early Trocks choreographer, to pull off a parody of ""Gaîté."" Susan Trevino's staging fails to suggest the subtle mix of giddiness, perfume and chic in the 1938 original by Léonide Massine and its fabled production by the Ballets Russe de Monte Carlo. And the costumes and set looked bargain-basement and saccharine in an otherwise exquisitely designed evening.

A staging by Robert La Fosse of Jerome Robbins's dark ""Cage"" on the second program may work better. But the highlights of the first program were the most purely classical performances -- in the ""Flames of Paris"" pas de deux, ""La Cachucha"" and the pas de six from ""Esmeralda"" -- where the comedy grew naturally from heartfelt dancing.

""He said ‘I hope you have weapons’ and then he flashed his gun at us and was like 'I have this so if anything happens to you then just yell and I'll come,'"" camper Madelyn Durand told WBKO, the ABC affiliate in Bowling Green, Ky.

She and friend Brad Ginn were camping at Mammoth Cave National Park on Sunday when the distressed individual gave them his dire warning, and then disappeared.

Minutes later, the couple said they heard gunshots, called 911, and hiked back to their car, where Park Rangers were waiting.

""Mammoth Cave National Park Law Enforcement Rangers responded to a reporting of an individual with a firearm in one of our back country camp sites in the early morning hours of Sunday, July 28,” Mammoth Cave's Public Information Officer Molly Schroer told WBKO. “The rangers made contact with all the parties involved. It is an ongoing investigation at this time.""

While the incident is not technically a Bigfoot sighting, as no creature was seen, the mere mention of the apparently quite elusive forest-dweller was enough to warrant headlines, adding to the mythology surrounding the bewildering beast.

In February, hunters in Utah claimed to have captured the hairy hulk on video, ambling across a mountain range. In August, 2018, a man claimed to see Bigfoot hopping a guardrail in Whitehall, NY. (Suspiciously, the village of Whitehall had recently adopted Bigfoot as its official animal.) And in April 2017, a grainy photo of the furry wanderer was snapped near a California lake, where a paranormal expert claimed he saw six Bigfeet, one of which was carrying a pig “over its shoulder.”

Tales of Bigfoot sightings trace back to the early 1800s. A collection of Bigfoot accounts were published in a Canadian newspaper series in the 1920s, and again in the 1940s, popularizing the shy giant. Since then, countless television shows and news stories have chronicled scores of alleged Bigfoot sightings. Many believe these and other accounts to be hoaxes or misidentified animals.

298,"The Bigfoot approach is to intentionally trade off high convergence, and therefore areal-density, in favor of high implosion velocity and good coupling between the laser, hohlraum, shell, and hotspot. This results in a short laser pulse that improves hohlraum symmetry and predictability, while the reduced compression reduces hydrodynamic instability growth. The results thus far include demonstrated low-mode symmetry control at two different hohlraum geometries (5.75 mm and 5.4 mm diameters) and at two different target scales (5.4 mm and 6.0 mm hohlraum diameters) spanning 300-405 TW in laser power and 0.8-1.6 MJ in laser energy. Additionally, by carefully scaling the 5.4 mm design to 6.0 mm, an increase in target scale of 13%, equivalent to 40% increase in laser energy, has been demonstrated.",mainstream,M0d6cc,big.foot
892,"Republican Denver Riggleman, author of the book “The Mating Habits of Bigfoot and Why Women Want Him” was elected to the House of Representatives on Tuesday night.

Riggleman won in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, defeating Democrat Leslie Cockburn. Riggleman received 53% of the vote to Cockburn’s 47%.

Riggleman’s book became an issue in the campaign when Cockburn accused him of being a “devotee of Bigfoot erotica.”

Her accusation appears to have stemmed from a Facebook author page, since deleted, for a self-published book by Riggleman.

Riggleman said the book was the product of a running joke between himself and his friends. He told the Washington Post the book was an “anthropological book sort of based on parody and satire.”

“I thought it was funny,” Riggleman said. “There is no way that anybody’s dumb enough to think this is real.”

The story delighted the internet, with many readers learning about the Bigfoot erotica literary genre for the first time. Amazon lists several titles dealing with sexy Sasquatches, including “Bigfoot and the Bridesmaid: Sex with Bigfoot, Book 1,” “Fabulous Beasts and the Women They Grind On” and “Seduced by Bigfoot and Ravaged by the Yeti: The Secret Adventures of a Fertile Housewife.”

Chuck Tingle, a prolific erotica satire author, responded to the controversy by releasing a book called “Don’t Vote For Virginia Congressional Hopeful Denber Wiggleman Because He Is Full Of Hate, Not Because Bigfoot Makes Him Hard.”

374,"A new digital version of Abilify is the first-ever pill to notify patients that they've swallowed it. It may be the first in a wave of dose-tracking drugs that could appeal to patients who forget to take their pills and to payers looking to get their money's worth out of their members' prescriptions.

The pill and its digital companions, now FDA-approved as Abilify MyCite, aren't likely to make a big difference to Otsuka's Abilify sales—certainly not immediately, given its plans for a limited initial launch. The atypical antipsychotic drug is already available as a cheap generic, and doctors are already using an injectable, long-lasting version—Abilify Maintena—to manage patients who have problems sticking to a daily pill regimen. Payers may be wary of the costs.

Then there's the fear factor. The pill and its companion smartphone app allow doctors—and anyone else the patient designates, for that matter—to track their dosing. Those tracking capabilities, which rely on an app that also lets patients record their mood, sleep and exercise, have stirred some anxiety. Some worry that the technology could be used to spy on people or coerce them into drug therapy.

But adherence to prescribed dosing is a big problem, one that some drugmakers have tried to battle for years; patients who don't take their medications don't refill their prescriptions. It's a pocketbook problem for payers that foot the bill for a prescribed drug and then pay to treat problems the drug was designed to prevent.

In the case of Abilify, a patient who doesn't stick to the drug could end up in a psychiatric hospital, so Abilify MyCite may find its niche. Psychiatric patients have particular problems sticking to their medications, and some of them might prefer a smart pill and phone app to an injection.

And Otsuka is aware that Abilify MyCite is a more complicated product than the usual pill, and it'll be more difficult to market, too. The drugmaker plans a small launch at first, so it can see how the digital-smart pill system works in the real world.

""[H]aving fewer people using the system initially means their prescribers, health plans, and Otsuka can focus on learning from these patients’ experiences,"" the company said in its announcement. ""This initial limited rollout will be a crucial step in determining Otsuka’s broader go-to-market plan.""

Though Abilify pills are already available as generics, Otsuka has been working on broadening the list of approvals for the long-lasting injectable version. The injection won a new use in bipolar disorder this year.

The Abilify MyCite approval is a bigger breakthrough for Proteus, which has been working on drug-device combo pills for years. This first U.S. approval could bode well for other new products in the works, including sensor-embedded versions of generic blood pressure pill lisinopril and the standard diabetes drug metformin.

It was Otsuka and Proteus' second try at the FDA for the digital version of Abilify. The agency rejected the drug-device combo last April, and the two companies resubmitted their application in May.",mainstream,M0de2f,big.foot

 Newsday’s little briefing on Pentagon intimidation of Schaffer

One of these men is not on the cover…

Both are subject to intimidation for speaking out about

 9/11.

 Which is the bigger story?

 

 Let Newsday know what you think!

Our previous story on the Intikab Habib case was premature.

We reported early Saturday morning that New York Newsday published an article about people who reject the US government’s account of the September 11 events.

The story by Newsday Staff Writer Patricia Hurtado had already appeared on the newsday.com website. But we later discovered that the editors kept it out of the newspaper itself. (That applies to the Long Island Saturday and “Early Sunday” editions, which are nearly identical in news content; the story did run in the lower-circulation New York City editions.)

Newsday’s front pages on Friday, Saturday and “Early Sunday” featured Imam Intikab Habib of Corona, Queens – who expressed doubts that the alleged 9/11 hijackers were solely responsible for the attacks on New York and Washington and the fall of the World Trade Center towers.

An incoming chaplain to the New York Fire Deparment, Habib was forced to resign just before taking his oath of office Friday morning. The news was accompanied by approving comments from Mayor Michael Bloomberg, FDNY Chief Nicholas Scopetta, and firefighters who were described as angered or offended by Habib’s views on 9/11.

Habib’s views became known to the Fire Department only after the first Newsday piece about him, printed just hours before his ouster. That article, by Carol Eisenberg, noted that in explaining his skepticism, “Habib talked about video and news reports widely disseminated in the Muslim community.”

Hurtado’s Saturday follow-up posed an important corrective by underlining that beliefs like Habib’s are also widespread far beyond the Muslim community. As published, her piece was short, and it saddled 9/11 skeptics with the usual “conspiracy theory” label. But it was Newsday‘s first look at the 9/11 truth movement, mentioning 911Truth.org among others. Hurtado also reviewed the 2004 Zogby poll finding that one-half of New York City residents believe US leaders “consciously failed” to prevent the September 11th events. (Newsday, “Sept. 11 conspiracy theories abound,” Oct. 1)

Hurtado and her colleague Eisenberg both told this author Friday they agreed it would be false if the Habib stories created the impression that 9/11 skepticism is somehow restricted to Muslims. (911Truth.org, “Incoming FDNY Chaplain Forced to Resign”, Oct. 1)

Newsday‘s follow-up coverage in the Saturday/”Early Sunday” Long Island editions featured almost two full pages on Habib’s ouster. A box with more than enough space for the Hurtado article was devoted instead to a potpourri of unrelated anecdotes about “controversial remarks by prominent figures,” some dating back as far as 1976. (Newsday, “Some who put their foot in it,” Oct. 1)

What’s Able Danger Got to Do With It?

To make matters worse, Newsday relegated the weekend’s biggest 9/11-related story – the Pentagon’s investigation of Col Anthony Shaffer on charges that include the alleged theft of pens – to a 170-word briefing on Page 21 of the same paper. The charges against Shaffer were made public just days after the Pentagon barred him and four other men from testifying to Congress on details of an elite military program, Able Danger, which they say tagged Mohamed Atta as an al-Qaeda terrorist operating in the United States at least one year before September 11. (See “A Pentagon Whitewash”)

Shaffer and the four other whistleblowers with knowledge of the program have told the press that in September 2000, as-yet unidentified military brass ordered the Able Danger crew to destroy all information on Atta and three other men later also alleged to have been ringleaders and hijackers in the 9/11 attacks. Able Danger was suspended altogether on the accession of the Bush administration in February 2001.

The Pentagon has not disputed the credibility of Shaffer or the four other individuals who remember that Atta was identified by Able Danger. But it has revoked Shaffer’s security clearance. Now he faces charges that he once flashed a military identification while drunk, obtained $68 in personal cell phone charges, and committed other, similarly earthshaking violations.

The Able Danger revelations lend credence to earlier reports in overseas media (never covered by major US news outlets) that the alleged hijackers were under near-constant observation by US and allied foreign authorities for years. Some reports suggest that the men who would be blamed for September 11th eluded early arrest only because they enjoyed high-level protection within the US government.

Where there is no vision, the people perish. – Newsday motto

Now that you’ve read the above, we are asking you right now to take five minutes to write a brief letter to Newsday, and urge them to change their priorities in reporting news about September 11th. This week presents the best window of opportunity.

Last year, the New York Times solicited and then rejected an editorial on the unanswered questions of 9/11 by Cynthia McKinney and Catherine Austin Fitts. (See “Day of the Dead: The Haunting of the White House,” 11/1/04)

Will Newsday show the courage to open its editorial pages to even one column voicing a skeptical perspective on September 11th?

The only rule we absolutely beg you to follow is to be civil.

If you hope to get your missive published, it should pack a punch and run no more than 200 words. Keep in mind that Newsday (like other newspapers) will only publish letters that include a return address and phone number, so that they can confirm it’s really from you. Do mention if you live in the New York area, or if you read or subscribe to Newsday in print or online. We don’t care if you mention 911Truth.org – pick the 9/11 sites, authors and sources you prefer.

The idea is not to have a thousand people sending the exact same message. This action will be most effective if you each write your own piece, so we are only giving you suggestions, of which you might cover one or two along with your own ideas.

The point is not to pick on Newsday. Its style in the Habib coverage has been sober and factual – in contrast to the predictably hateful echo in certain other New York dailies. It is mainly by omission that Newsday is distorting the reality of the Habib case, and of 9/11 as a whole. Newsday is one of the few major US dailies that still engages in investigative reporting – and that could actually decide to make a difference in ending the September 11th cover-up and exposing the co-perpetrators and collaborators likely to be found within our own government and its covert agencies.

After sending it to Newsday, you can also post your missive here.

And then you can send your friends the link to this page!

1) An imam who emigrated to New York from Guyana has been turned into the American face of 9/11 skepticism, as though millions of Christians, Jews, Buddhists and atheists haven’t been harboring the same doubts about September 11th for years.

2) As though a number of best-selling authors – several of them white guys in suits – haven’t already taken public stands, from David Ray Griffin to Michael Ruppert to Michel Chossudovsky. (Cite your favorite book. Point out that Griffin will be speaking on “The Destruction of the World Trade Center” in New York City on Oct. 15 – isn’t that worthy of coverage?)

3) Emphasizing Habib while ignoring alternative researchers and the 9/11 truth movement is unfair to the Muslim community. Once again, Muslims are being singled out. By implication, they are different from other Americans. Muslims end up defined as the ones who doubt the official story, and who do so only because they are Muslims.

4) The mass media have cited almost exclusively angry reactions to Habib, including from Bloomberg and Scopetta. Someone reading this might think that all New Yorkers, at least the non-Muslims, are automatically offended whenever anyone doubts the Official Story of 9/11. (As of Monday afternoon, media outlets had generated several hundred further stories on the Habib case, according to a Google news search. Most of these perpetuate the paradigm that Habib’s honest views constitute a slur to New Yorkers.)

5) But the Zogby poll, which Newsday has now acknowledged, suggests that half of New Yorkers don’t believe the official story, and that two-thirds want a new investigation. There’s no doubt that a substantial number of Newsday‘s readers agree.

6) This is also unfair to the millions of 9/11 skeptics around the world, whose opinions (right or wrong) derive from how they understand the facts, and are usually unrelated to their religious beliefs.And why do stories about skeptics tend to focus on the psychology that makes these “conspiracy theorists” tick? Shouldn’t Newsday and other newspapers at least report fairly on the arguments people make for not believing the official story?

7) Skeptical views of 9/11 have received a first hearing on Capitol Hill thanks to Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-GA). This summer she hosted three days of presentations by alternative researchers, including David Ray Griffin, author of The New Pearl Harbor. Wasn’t that worthy of coverage?

8) The first day of the McKinney hearings (July 22) opened with a one-hour presentation by Mindy Kleinberg and Lorie van Auken, two of the “Jersey Widows” who fought to gain the 9/11 Commission in the first place. Point by well-documented point, they rejected The 9/11 Commission Report as a whitewash. The views of the Jersey wives were considered worthy of coverage in the past, when they supported the 9/11 Commission. Why not now?

9) The McKinney hearings were subsequently aired on C-SPAN, which also broadcast Nafeez Ahmed’s session at the DC Emergency Truth Convergence and the historic Madison speech by David Ray Griffin (transcript here).

10) What about other members of Sept. 11th families who have gone on record to demand full truth disclosure? Donna Marsh O’Connor, mother of Vanessa Lang Langer, spoke at the September 11th, 2005 Rally to End the Media Blackout in New York City. Bob McIlvaine, father of Robert McIlvaine, presided alongside McKinney as a Citizens’ Commissioner at the 9/11 Omissions Hearings in New York in September 2004. Fifty families of September 11th and one hundred notables spanning the political spectrum signed the 911 Truth Statement – including the three leading third-party candidates in the 2004 election.

Habib, Shaffer and Others Pay the Price for Staying True to Themselves

11) Habib has been punished for opinions that he clearly did not intend to express in his capacity as chaplain; opinions he did not express when participating in the Fire Department’s 9/11 ceremonies two weeks before; opinions that became known only because of direct questions from Newsday. On top of being run out of the job, he now feels compelled to engage in a sackcloth-and-ashes ritual, as evidenced by his open letter.

12) Meanwhile, a whistleblower like Col. Anthony Shaffer reveals that the Pentagon knew the alleged 9/11 hijackers, thought they were potential terrorists, and ordered the evidence destroyed a year before Sept. 11. And for speaking out, Shaffer has harvested a muzzle, intimidation, and ludicrous charges designed to destroy him personally. Should we be thankful that the Shaffer story at least made Page 21?

13) Habib and Shaffer join the ranks of others who have been harrassed, fired, demoted or forced to resign after voicing alternative views or bringing up uncomfortable facts about September 11th. Prominent examples include FBI translator Sibel Edmonds, FBI Special Agent Robert Wright, US Air Force Colonel Steven Butler, and Underwriters Laboratories executive Kevin Ryan. (Ryan was fired after questioning the official story on how the Towers collapsed. See the column of previous stories here, under Ongoing.)

14) Always remember that the official story itself is a conspiracy theory. If the alleged captured masterminds of 9/11 – Khalid Sheikh Mohamed and Ramzi Binalshibh – are ever indicted in US courts, they will be charged under our country’s voluminous conspiracy laws. (Well, if they really are alive and in US custody, but that’s another story.)

15) The idea that Saddam Hussein had any connection to 9/11 (as propagated by the Vice President among others) surely qualifies as an “outrageous conspiracy theory,” one without basis in confirmable or even reported fact.

16) Many people abhor the naked exploitation of the 9/11 events to enable an extremist agenda and a bogus “War on Terror” that has transformed America and the world. Many in addition have come to believe the attacks were allowed, facilitated or even engineered by elements of the US covert-policy apparatus so as to gain popular support for that agenda.

17) Further suspicion is raised by the way official investigations like the 9/11 Commission completely ignored bodies of evidence pointing towards foreknowledge or complicity by US officials.

A few of the Top 15 Reasons to Doubt the Official Story

 All ignored or trivialized by the 9/11 Commission

– Military wargames on Sept. 11th itself improbably mirrored the 9/11 scenario, apparently confusing air defense response and providing cover for the actual attacks.

– The various stories of the air defense failure as told by Gen. Richard Myers, NORAD, FAA, the 9/11 Commission and USAF keep changing and conflict with each other. No one has ever been held accountable for upholding false accounts.

– In fact, no one in government has ever been held accountable for any 9/11-related failure. If all of the failures are really due to incompetence, that’s almost as frightening as the idea that 9/11 was an inside job.

– The highest members of the military chain of command showed a consistent and suspicious pattern of no response during most of the actual time of the attacks. Bush, Rumsfeld, Myers, Gen. Montague Winfield of the National Military Command Center and Adm. Richard Mies of Stratcom each either went missing or found better things to do than to assume the duties of their offices. (See the wargames review for a summary of their (in)activities on Sept. 11.)

– The Pakistani ISI money connection to the alleged hijackers was steadfastly ignored by the 9/11 Commissioners, who even made the astonishing admission (p. 172) that they think the open question of who financed the hijackers is “of little practical significance.” The motto seems to be: Don’t follow the money!

– The many reports of insider trading internationally, based on apparent foreknowledge of the attacks, go far beyond the “put options” incidents. (The 9/11 Commission said the well-known short-sells on United and American airlines are insignificant, because the buyers had “no conceivable connection” to Al Qaeda. As though it were a natural law that only people inside Al Qaeda could have ever known about 9/11 in advance.)

– The dozen-plus warnings from foreign agencies, some of whom even delivered names of the future alleged hijackers (the same four names as came up in Able Danger!). At no point did the Commission treat any of these – it’s as though reports from outside the US never existed.

– The consistent blocking of FBI investigations that might have uncovered the future hijackers, in a fashion that suggests high-level obstruction more readily than bureaucratic antagonisms or incompetence.

– The march of visibly different “Osamas” appearing in the various Bin Ladin videos, all of which are of dubious provenance. Who knows which is the real one?

– The many historical precedents for false-flag terror attacks arranged by an unaccountable secret policy apparatus; and the precedents for false casus belli, from “Remember the Maine” to the Gulf of Tonkin.

– The case that the World Trade Center towers and WTC 7 were demolished. Why have the major New York papers refused to ask Larry Silverstein what he meant when he said that Building 7 was pulled?

Our democracy is seriously endangered by the Bush administration’s post-9/11 policies, which make no sense whatsoever if they are intended to combat terrorism; but which make perfect sense in the context of the desperate grab for world power desired by the Project for A New American Century.

Dear Honorable Mayor, members of the Fire Department, and New Yorkers,

I am humbly writing this letter to you, clarifying the statement I made on Thursday, [September] 29 2005.

I was asked several times by a news reporter about the coincidence of my Islamic education being from Saudi Arabia and the 19 hijackers of September 11th also being from Saudi- whether that would place a barrier between myself and the fire fighters?

I innocently explained to her after she asked me to this effect several times, that I personally do not really know who committed the 9/11 attacks based on the conflicting information that I heard from the media.

My response in this context was only meant innocently to tell her that, not knowing who committed the attack avails me that idling consciousness of how my fire fighter brothers and sisters would look at me, and it makes me assimilate very smoothly with this department and thus, there should absolutely be no barriers. The news reporter’s further inquiries as to the reasons why I am not really certain who committed the 9/11 attacks prompted me to mention the conflicting information that I heard from the media.

My Mayor, Fire Fighters, and New Yorkers, this was the first time I was ever interviewed by the media and I didn’t know that all of my innocent and friendly chat with this reporter would be placed in the media to cause such an outrage with my New Yorker’s brothers and sisters.

I regret any inconveniences my words may have caused. This incident is very difficult on me, my family, and the Muslim community. I hope you, the members of the Fire Department, and the New Yorkers can find it in your hearts to see my innocence, and that I never meant to be insensitive to the families who have lost love ones on 9/11.

It was a pleasure working for this City in the capacity of a chaplain in the Fire Department. I had a wonderful time serving my fire fighter brothers and sisters. It felt as if we were a big family. It was very hard for me to accept that the day I was to be sworn in as a chaplain, I ended up resigning. I am sure life has many lessons to learn.

In conclusion my respected Mayor, fire fighters, and New Yorkers, I would like to state that neither I nor any other true Muslim in this beautiful country, in any way condone the 9/11 attacks. It was tragic, sad, and unfortunate. May Almighty God guide and bless our Mayor and the citizens of our land.

SIDEBAR

 ‘Here is this gaunt figure’ in 2000 photo

WASHINGTON — It was shortly after Sept. 11, 2001, that Anthony Shaffer says he learned from a Pentagon contractor whose Able/Danger data had not been destroyed that the information gathered by the project the year before included Sept. 11 hijacker Mohamed Atta, whose name and photo had quickly become recognizable around the world.

“We had coffee and talked about this issue,” Shaffer said. “She’s the one who brought it to my attention: `Oh, by the way, here’s one of the charts from before 9/11.’ It was one of those open-source data runs, and it showed the picture.”

It was not, Shaffer said, the menacing Florida driver’s license photo of Atta that has become an emblem of the attacks.

“Here is this gaunt figure,” Shaffer recalled. “He’s very distinctive. This is an older, more grainy photo we had of him. It was not the best picture in the world.”

But Shaffer said he has no doubt the face in the picture was Mohamed Atta the hijacker. “No,” he said. “Same guy.”

Within days of his conversation with the contractor, someone associated with Able/Danger brought the chart to Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.), whose House subcommittee on military technology had funded Able/Danger.

The contractor did not return a message left on her home answering machine. But Weldon told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that on Sept. 25, 2001, he took the Atta chart to Stephen Hadley, then the deputy to National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. She is now secretary of state and Hadley is national security adviser.

“He said to me, and I remember this quote, `I’ve got to show this to The Man,'” Weldon testified. “I said, `The Man?’ He said, `Yes, the president of the United States.'”

Hadley’s spokesman, Frederick Jones II, said Hadley vaguely recalled having been shown a chart portraying “link analysis” of the sort done by Able/Danger.

But, Jones said, Hadley did not remember seeing Atta’s name or photo on the chart, whether it was Weldon or someone else who showed it to him, or whether that person left the chart with him or took it away.

Shaffer, an Army Reserve officer who sat in the audience at the hearing in his uniform, was placed on paid administrative leave from his civilian job after his security clearance was lifted, after an investigation into possibly improper expense reports amounting to under $300.

Shaffer maintains the reports were not improper and says he plans to appeal the suspension of his clearance. Weldon said there was “no doubt in my mind” that the security clearance had been suspended in response to Shaffer’s efforts to make the Atta story public.

Pentagon intelligence officials say that while they cannot find a copy of the Atta chart, they do not dispute the credibility of Shaffer or the four other individuals who remember having seen it.

“The fact that the our government had this information at one time, and possibly destroyed it, is haunting,” Weldon says, adding that he does not believe the military’s account that the Able/Danger data were destroyed only to comply with Pentagon regulations.

“I seriously have my doubts that it was routine,” he says.

An officer who has claimed that a classified military unit identified four Sept. 11 hijackers before the 2001 attacks is facing Pentagon accusations of breaking numerous rules, charges his lawyer suggests are aimed at undermining his credibility. The alleged infractions by Army Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer, 42, include obtaining a service medal under false pretenses, improperly flashing military identification while drunk, and stealing pens, according to paperwork from the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency. Shaffer was one of the first to publicly link 9/11 leader Mohamed Atta to the unit code-named Able Danger and one of five witnesses the Pentagon ordered not to appear Sept. 21 before the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss the unit’s findings. The military revoked Shaffer’s top security clearance this month, a day before he was supposed to testify to a congressional committee. Mark Zaid, Shaffer’s attorney, said he can’t prove the Pentagon went after Shaffer because he’s a whistleblower, but “all the timing associated with the clearance issue has been suspiciously coincidental.”",conspiracy,C038d8,big.foot
708,"After weeks of speculation, a U.S. television show aired what it called ""the footage of the century"" on Wednesday night â a Manitoba man's video of what he says is a Bigfoot.

The video, shot by ferry boat operator Bobby Clark, was shown on Fox Television's tabloid show A Current Affair. It's believed the program paid as much as $100,000 for the pictures.

Manitoba Sasquatch Research Centre founder Bill Borody told the Winnipeg Free Press he doesn't think the video is real.

The creature isn't shaped like a sasquatch, it doesn't appear to be moving and there appears to be too much light for it to be 6:30 a.m., the time Clark said he shot the video, said Borody.

But another Bigfoot watcher is a little more open to the possibility the tape is real.

Matt Moneymaker, director of the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, concludes the blurry image on the video is not a trick of the light, not a bear and not a fabricated image.

The dark figure with arms and legs is ""either a human or a sasquatch"" but ""is not clearly one or the other,"" writes Moneymaker on his website.

Clark filmed the video at a river crossing north of the community of Norway House on April 16. Norway House is about 460 kilometres north of Winnipeg.",mainstream,M0f694,big.foot
654,"Ancient Aliens Are Racist and Other Lefty Insanity

If you’ve watched The History Channel, you know that “ancient aliens” probably built the Pyramids and Stonehenge and maybe the Hanging Gardens of Babylon (and why wouldn’t little green men have little green thumbs?)

Of course, if you watch The History Channel, you also know that Adolf Hitler may have escaped Germany via U-boat and was spotted 1950 working as a volunteer starter at a Venezuelan golf course. At the long-abandoned Lebensraum Country Club, researchers have found SS-logo tees and a novelty mug reading, “A Bad Day on the Fairway Beats a Good Day in the Bunker.”

You may also be aware that Bigfoot guards pirates’ treasure at the bottom of a bottomless well on Oak Island. And that finding a saddle bolt from a 1916 Indian motorcycle beneath a pile of rat droppings turns on the American Pickers guys in ways that don’t seem quite wholesome.

In short, not much you see on the History Channel these days is worth spit as history, and the History Channel is about the only place you see this garbage. So why would academics spend time developing theories about (and liberal magazines devote pages to) ancient aliens? Because (wait for it!) racism.

On the site Hyperallergic, author Sarah E. Bond tells readers that recent archeological discoveries are more proof against the “long-held but fringe theory that the blocks were so heavy and the distances they would have to travel so lengthy that aliens must have built the pyramids.” She then goes on to devote more than 2,000 words to the “fringe theory.”

506,"Obama continues to push $66 billion for preschool, despite concerns

(BigGovernment.news) A proposal for universal preschool in President Barack Obama’s final budget would add $66 billion to federal spending over the next decade, despite recent findings in Tennessee that show such programs have minimal impact on achievement.

This is the third year the Obama administration has pushed Congress for an expanded federal-state partnership for school for 4-year-olds, which proponents say would help close the performance gap for children from low- or moderate-income families.

The Congressional Budget Office noted the $66-billion price tag in a report, released March 29, on the president’s 2017 budget.

But Ross Whitehurst, a clinical child psychologist and senior fellow with the Brookings Institute, questions the plan. “For most kids, there’s no substantial benefit, and maybe some harm, from attending pre-K,” he told AMI Newswire.

Whitehurst refers to a study out of Vanderbilt University last fall that found students in Tennessee’s $213-million preschool program ultimately performed worse than their non-preschool counterparts by the end of second grade.

The Vanderbilt study said participants in a preschool program were better prepared for, and performed better during, kindergarten than their counterparts, but that the benefits didn’t last.

Whitehurst noted the federal government already has a “mismash” of programs directed at early learning that cost about $14 billion per year, according to testimony he gave two years ago before a House committee.

“I do not oppose spending more, but there are many aspects of the administration’s plan that I don’t like,” he said.

Although not an opponent of preschool programs, Whitehurst expressed concern that the latest proposal, virtually identical to the ones before it, represented Washington “taking over” the early childhood process, calling it a “pretty big foot” in the door of federal control of what has been, to this point, a state-driven program.
• More:

 Once again, loud and clear: School funding not tied to educational outcomes and achievement

Texas, for example, provides preschool to certain children, including those who are homeless, cared for by active duty service members, or unable to speak or comprehend English.

The proposed program would actually cost about $120 billion over the next 10 years, with states opting into the program and chipping in 40 percent of the costs, Whitehurst noted.

Similar to the Affordable Care Act’s Medicare expansion provisions, the Preschool for All bill would require states to opt-in to the program in order to receive federal funding.

In its latest report, the Congressional Budget Office gave lower overall estimates than the Department of Education due, in part, to the expectation that some states would initially reject the program.

In a memo on the 2017 Budget, the Obama Administration suggest costs would be paid for, in part, through increased tobacco taxes.

Although Whitehurst is skeptical of a universal program, he said studies do show preschool helps children from non-English-speaking homes learn English more quickly in preparation for kindergarten. It also helps low-income families receive a form of free child care.

He advocates programs that more directly target these groups, but said proponents of universal preschool worry targeted programs, particularly those for the poor, would not receive widespread political support.

“As I see it, I try to represent what research says,” he said. “It’s not my goal to play the political game, but to understand how much we don’t know, understand the research limitations.”

Whitehurst said “elevating” preschool might be a bad idea for the stated goal of reducing achievement gaps, when the money could go to programs showing more promise in addressing that goal.

A National Bureau of Economic Research study on 106 students in a Chicago-based math-tutoring program found 9th-graders, on average, were able to develop math skills in one year what the average student developed in three years, closing the equivalent of two-thirds of the education gap between black and white students. According to Whitehurst, who spoke about the program at a Brooking’s Institute talk last week, the Chicago program costs about $3,000 per student.

“If you gave me a choice between spending $3,000 to get a bunch of kids — who are going to drop out because they’re failing at math — up to speed, or spending $9,000 on a year on pre-K for every child in general, I choose the former,” Whitehurst said.

The program is among the largest items in an education budget proposed by Obama that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would add $152 billion to the deficit over the next decade.

1270,"Believers theorize that he came down from Mt. Hood, the 14,000-foot blizzard-shrouded peak just outside Portland, Oregon. Massive, standing nearly nine feet tall and weighing all of 900 pounds, he strode down the wooded ridges, north and east to the 7,000-foot level where the spring snow lay wet and heavy in forests 50 miles from the nearest road. At the 4,000-foot level, the thick coniferous forests thinned and the deep mountain gorges leveled out. It was late June, 1971, and the lower rivers raged with the waters of the melting snow pack.

At the 3,000-foot level the first growths of douglas fir and oak gave way to a few scrub oak, growing singly. From a high point on the ridge that runs down from Mt. Hood called Seven Mile Hill, he could see the lights of The Dalles, Oregon, where 11,000 people lived.

Fifteen miles upriver the Wy-am Indians, roped to their platforms perched over the boiling river, netted spring chinook salmon by the hundreds with their long poles. This they had done every spring since prehistory. The Great Food is what the Wy-am call salmon; and perhaps he had come down to the semi-arid insecurity of The Dalles to scramble on the banks of the river for the Great Food during one of the largest salmon runs on the North American Continent. Some who theorize about him think that he came down to this narrow point in the river where there is little current because an island breaks the swim to Washington and the Cascade Range—where the deer and huckleberries are plentiful in the summer.

East the land opens to treeless rolling hills. Great high-tension towers converge on the Chenowith Converter and scar the land as far as the eye can see. There was no cover for him there. But to swim the river from here, four miles west of The Dalles, he had only to cross two roads: the old highway to Portland, US 30, and the new Interstate, 80N.

Things had changed since he had last been down to the river. There was an aluminum plant nearby, a new shopping center, a Rocket gas station, a new and used car lot, and—strangest of all for him during the nights—The Dalles drive-in which specializes in films like Deathmaster and The Two-Headed Thing. In the early daylight hours of this first day of June, 1971, he stood in a small meadow above what had been a large foothill apple orchard. It was now filled with flat electrified platforms and called The Pinewood Mobile Manor.

Joe Mederios, maintenance man for the trailer court, was watering flowers near his trailer that morning. Directly across US 30 is a large fenced meadow. At about 150 yards a rocky ledge of perhaps 35 feet banks a higher meadow. Mederios caught a movement along the ledge from a corner of his eye. He assumed it was George Johnson, the owner of the land, and went back to watering his flowers. But his mind was engaged in a curious and unconscious arithmetic. He had seen Johnson on the land previously—it wasn’t unusual—but this figure was too big … the arms were too long … the shoulders too broad.

Mederios turned to the ridge for a longer look. What he saw was a shaggy, gray figure he took to be at least ten feet tall. It had an oval face and a crest or dorsal ridge along the top of its head. The face was flat, brown and hairless.

The man turned back to his flowers and considered his situation. He was responsible to some Portland businessmen who would be down to The Dalles the next day. If he were to report the sighting, there would be deputies and curiosity-seekers tromping all over his carefully watered flowers about the time his bosses arrived. Mederios later told Sheriff’s deputy Rich Carlson that he didn’t report the incident for fear he’d “be called a nut.”

The next day, around noon, the three businessmen met Mederios and were in the midst of discussions in a trailer office fronting the meadow when Mederios again saw an erect ape-like figure through a window. The four men ran outside and watched from across the road as it moved through a break in the ridge and came into the lower meadow where it walked among the sparse scrub oak near the rocks. It stopped near a small tree, and from where the men stood, it appeared to be somewhat taller than the tree. The four men and the other creature stared at one another for perhaps a minute, before it turned, went up through the break in the rocks and disappeared into the upper meadow.

This time the sighting was reported and deputy Carlson went out to investigate.

From Carlson’s report filed on June 2nd, ’71: “Mr. Mederios … described it as being about ten feet tall, greyish in color, real wide shoulders and arms that hung way down. He went on to say it looked like an overgrown ape. He stated it was not a bear. The creature was walking upright at the time of the sighting.”

The Portland men, solid citizens all, confirmed the sighting and description.

The same night, about 9:30, when the last summer light was fading in the meadow, a man named Rich Brown, a high-school music teacher, and his wife were returning from a choir practice he had been conducting. At the entrance to the trailer court, Brown’s wife either shouted or screamed and pointed to a figure in the lower meadow. Brown swung his car around and put the headlights stark into the meadow. He was joined by a second car, and eventually Mederios, who stepped out of the office to see why the cars were blocking the entrance.

At a distance of about 65 yards the creature froze and stared into the lights. Brown sprinted for his trailer, grabbed a Winchester 30.06 with a four-power scope. He opened his car door and steadied the rifle. He considered a shot at the heart, then the head. With the scope cross-hairs squarely between the thing’s expressionless flat black eyes, he released the safety. Like any good marksman, Brown squeezes the trigger slowly. In the moment between the final squeeze and the shot, Rich Brown, who had just come from a church, made a complicated moral decision.

“I couldn’t shoot it,” he said later, “because it looked more human than animal.”

Aside from Indian legends, which are virtually timeless, the Bigfoot saga on the North American Continent begins in 1811 when the explorer David Thompson noted in his daily journal the track of “a large animal … the whole is about 14 inches by eight inches wide,” in the Canadian Rockies by the site of what is now Jasper, Alberta. Several months later Thompson found similar tracks which he followed for nearly 100 yards. “Reports from the old times,” he noted offhandedly, “had made the head branches of this river and the mountains in the vicinity the abode of apes or more very large animals.”

In July of 1884, a Victoria, British Columbia, newspaper, the Daily Colonist, published an account of the capture of a gorilla-type animal the miners called Jacko. About 4’7″ tall and weighing about 125 pounds, the animal may have been a young Bigfoot. No other mention can be found of Jacko in the Daily Colonist.

The Seattle Times reported a series of bizarre great ape sightings around Mt. St. Lawrence near Kelso, Washington, in July of 1918. In 1924, a group of miners camped near Mt. St. Helen in Washington claimed a horde of giant ape-like creatures attacked them in the middle of the night. One was shot and rolled into a deep canyon which is known today as Ape Canyon. Also in 1924, a prospector named Albert Ostman claimed that while camping near Vancouver he was picked up in his sleeping bag and carried 25 miles by a giant hairy ape. They arrived in a sheltered valley where he was curiously observed for several days by a family of four Bigfeet. He eventually fed them chewing tobacco and escaped while they were sick.

In 1940, the Chapmans, an Amerindian Indian family living near the Fraser River in British Columbia, claimed a giant hairy ape walked out of the woods and turned over a massive barrel of salt fish in the shed. Footprints were left and local residents reported, they were 16 inches long and eight inches wide. The stride length was about four feet. Mrs. Chapman said the creature was about eight feet tall.

American sightings made national headlines in the Bluff Creek area of Northern California in October of 1958. On the ninth of that month, the Humboldt Times reported that Jerry Crew, a road builder for the Granite Logging Company, made a cast of a huge footprint—16 inches long—he found on the damp bed of a newly built lumbering access road. The stride was 50 inches long, he said, and ran along the road for a distance of about three quarters of a mile.

Five days later two construction workers for the same company were driving along a remote mountain road late at night when they saw what they took to be the owner of the prints. Ray Kerr, then 43, said, “it ran upright like a man, swinging long hairy arms … it looked eight to ten feet tall to me.” Tracks found the next morning were identical to the first set.

Interviewed in the Humboldt Times, Ray Wallace, a partner in the logging firm, denied that he had perpetrated a hoax. “Who knows anyone foolish enough to ruin their own business,” he said. Fifteen men had quit their jobs since the sightings. Workers reported that they saw nothing during the day but that every morning they found huge and apparently curious prints around the equipment. Huge gasoline drums had been turned over. Some workers had the uncomfortable sensation that they were being watched during the day. “I’ve got three tractors up there without operators, man,” Wallace complained. “And all my brush-cutting crew has quit.”

Dr. Maurice Tripp, a geophysicist from Los Gatos, California, made casts of the prints which proved that the toes showed mechanical function. After studying the soil and the depth of the print, Tripp estimated the probable creature’s weight at 800 pounds. None of his casts showed impact ridges which would have indicated that they were made by some kind of mechanical stomping machine.

Another series of prints, 1,089 in all, were discovered near Bossberg, Washington, in October of 1969. The tracks measured 17½” x 7″. The right foot seemed to be twisted inwards and calluses on the outside of the foot and the extrapolated bone structure indicated the creature who made the prints had a clubfoot. Dr. Grover Krantz, a physical anthropologist at Washington State University, studied casts of the Bossberg prints and concluded that if the tracks were hoaxed, the fakers were “absolute experts in human anatomy.”

Since the ’58 Bluff Creek sightings, hundreds more have been recorded, some less credible than others. While Albert Ostman only claimed to have been kidnapped by Bigfeet, one Helen Westring confessed, right on the front page of the National Bulletin (July, 1969), I WAS RAPED BY AN ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN. Seems that while Helen was out hunting one day in the Minnesota woods she was attacked by a giant horny ape who stripped her of her flimsy clothes in a thrice and had his hairy way with her right there on the mute forest loam.

There are many men hunting Bigfoot on a more or less regular basis, and one of the most impressive is a 46-year-old, Dublin-born former big-game hunter named Peter Byrne. Financed by Ohio businessman Tom Page and several others who wish to remain anonymous, Byrne has one paid assistant, two young volunteers, two International Scout jeeps, a pickup truck, a helicopter on 24-hour notice, and a plethora of equipment including infrared night-scopes and sophisticated tranquilizer guns.

Byrne, who does not take a salary from expedition funds but lives off his own income, has a Hemingwayesque history. In World War II he flew for the RAF, and subsequently ended up as assistant manager of a tea plantation in Nepal. He once effected the rescue of an Everest expedition stranded by an avalanche at the 20,000-foot level. For 15 years he led big-game hunts in Africa.

In 1968, with the game thinning out (more from poachers than hunters), Byrne wearied of leading bumbling clients through the brush and pointing them at the animals he had come to respect. He organized the nonprofit International Wildlife Conservation Society. As executive director, Byrne spent two years creating two large tiger sanctuaries in Nepal. The project was completed in November of 1970.

While in Nepal, Byrne had become fascinated with the legend of the Yeti (the perhaps mythical Abominable Snowman, cousin to the perhaps mythical Bigfoot). He disputed the findings of Sir Edmund Hillary’s 1960 Yeti hunting expedition, insisting that a month search didn’t constitute a real effort to find the beast. The Yeti scalp Hillary took from a Tibetan monastery had been analyzed as a goat-and antelope-hair fabrication, proving, to Hillary’s satisfaction, that none of the sacred Yeti relics in any of the monasteries were authentic. Byrne felt that the scalp Hillary found was a copy of an original he never saw. Byrne himself had visited half a dozen of the monasteries and in one secretly cut the thumb from a mummified hand. He wired a mummified human thumb to the palm and sent the relic to scientists in Paris, then London, then the United States. In all cases the scientists came up with the inconclusive conclusion that the thumb was not human, that it was animal, and that further, it was unclassifiable.

In the Himalayas, only two Europeans have claimed Yeti sightings. Byrne, fascinated with the hypothetical creatures to a point just short of obsession, knew that there were hundreds of sightings in the Pacific Northwest. In 1971 he organized the present three-year search. He has, to date, logged hundreds of thousands of miles on the jeeps, interviewed hundreds of claimants, talked at length to the Indians about their legends and knowledge of the apes, and camped in the woods in various sighting areas nearly a year’s worth of elapsed time. Byrne regards as his strongest piece of evidence an 18-second piece of film taken by one Roger Patterson near Bluff Creek in the early afternoon hours of October 7th, 1967.

Patterson, a small rancher and weekend Bigfoot hunter from Yakima, Washington, had spent four years and thousands of dollars on his search. He claims to have been on horseback in the Bluff Creek area with Bob Gimlin, his tracker, when they caught sight of a female Bigfoot crouched by a stream. Patterson’s horse spooked and nearly threw him. He pulled his camera from his saddlebag and ran toward the creature, trying to focus simultaneously.

The 16mm color film begins with a wild, jerking view of the manzanita underbrush. The camera steadies, pans right, and focuses in on an erect, apelike figure which appears to be about 30 feet away. It walks, at a slight angle to camera, into a thickly wooded area and disappears. It turns once toward the camera and its face shows large black eyes, a small nose, a massive jaw, and a crest or ridge on the head. Muscle movement can be seen in the upper right thigh. When the right arm swings back, large, hair-covered breasts become visible.

Patterson, apparently anxious to validate his film, took a lie detector test which he passed. He submitted the film to the Smithsonian’s director of primate biology, John Napier (now visiting professor of primate biology at the University of London), who has expressed his doubts in the recently published book Bigfoot.

The walk seems to Napier “self-consciously” fluid. The stride is essentially that of a human male while the filmed creature is female. The crest is a male feature on orangutans and gorillas, seldom seen in females. The heavy buttocks seen in the Patterson film are a human feature, out of place on the apelike superstructure. Furthermore, the 14″ x 7″ prints—on a human scale—would indicate a creature nearly eight feet tall while both Byrne and Napier have estimated the height of the Patterson creature at about 6’6″. Napier concludes his discussion of the film by saying that he won’t proclaim it a hoax almost solely because, “I cannot see the zipper.”

Byrne respectfully disagrees. “Napier is using human formulas to deal with an unknown quantity,” he says.

Byrne published the results of a year’s investigation in the prestigious Explorers Journal. His case for the existence of the Giant Apes (which he calls Omah, after the local Indians), briefly and inadequately summarized, is as follows:

1). There are hundreds of thousands of virtually unexplored and roadless wilderness areas in the Pacific Northwest. The habitat of the Omah might be in the steep, thickly wooded gorges of this region.

2). These same areas support black and brown bear. If the Omah were an omnivore, with a diet roughly similar to that of a bear, the forests could easily support a small Omah population.

3). There have been few sightings, because like most primates, the Omah is wary of man. (First reports of African gorillas in the early 17th century were treated as folklore. Not until the middle of the 19th century did Europeans succeed in tracking down the shy beasts.)

Byrne does not speculate on the origin of Omah, though when pressed he will mention the fossil remains of a Chinese primate anthropologists call Gigantopithecus. “Its estimated height was between ten and 12 feet and the fossils were discovered in an area of China scientists think provided the native American population, the Eskimos and the Indians.” The theory, of course, is that nomadic tribes migrated across the frozen Bering Strait. “A case, I think, can be made for Gigantopithecus as an ancestor to Omah,” Byrne says.

Currently living in a trailer in The Dalles, Byrne is still deeply involved in the hunt. If he should come on one of the animals, he plans to dart it and keep it subdued for several days. A team of scientists have agreed to fly in at any time at his expense. They would land in Portland and helicopter to the site. There they would take photos, measurements, urine, stool and blood samples. The Omah would then be set free.

I asked if a tranquilizer capable of bringing down a beast that could conceivably weigh up to 1,000 pounds wouldn’t kill a man hoaxed up in a gorilla suit.

“No,” Byrne says, and adds wryly: “Unfortunately, the safety margin is quite high. The drug has been tested on volunteer prisoners. It simply puts a man under for quite a long period without harming him. You can, however, quote me as saying I would be delighted to put a dart in the ass of any jerk wearing a fur suit for my benefit.”

I am indebted to Sgt. Jack Robertson of The Dalles Sheriff’s department for a bit of woodsy Omah lore.

“If you should be out in the woods without a weapon,” he said, “and you see Bigfoot, just throw some crap in his face and he’ll run away. They hate that.”

“What am I going to do if there isn’t any crap around?”

“Listen,” Robertson said, “if you’re out in the woods alone and you see him, there’ll be plenty of crap around.”

Flora Thompson is 74 years old, a Wy-am Indian who lives at Celilo Falls, the prime salmon netting spot on the Columbia River, which her tribe calls “Wauna.” Flora studied and learned the legends of the Wy-am from her late husband, the great chief Tommy Thompson, who died at 108 in 1951. She can tell about the time before men when all the animals were people and were giants. Coyote was the Changer. He dug a trench from the great eastern lake to the ocean so the salmon could swim upstream. In this way Coyote made the earth fit for man.

In the Changing Time, just after there were men, there was another beast. As Flora Thompson describes it, it is very much like the Omah in the Patterson film. It was a female and its name was Tlat-ta-chee-ah.

“We use Tlat-ta-chee-ah as a scarecrow,” Flora says. “We tell the bad children that she will come to eat them if they don’t behave.”

The Wy-am are not the only tribe that have legends about giant, ape-like creatures. Many tribes call him Sasquatch.

In British Columbia, the Salish call him Stwanitie. The Quamault of the Olympic Peninsula call him Seeakwa. In Alberta he is called Tsonqua and Ghaga, and in Northern California, the Hoopa call him Kadonkwa. In the Central Pacific Northwest many tribes call him Omah.

Peter Byrne in his investigation has talked to many of the tribes in the general sighting areas. Two elderly Indians on the Colville reservation located in Northeastern Washington told him that their grandfathers spoke of seeing up to 20 Omah catching salmon during run on the Columbia River. In the 1850s, they said, the Omah caught the white man’s disease and died.

Another legend prevalent in the Northwest is that there were once many Omah and they lived not only in the forests, but also far to the south and in the plains of the east. The Indians warred with them, and by the time the white man came, they were all gone.

Item: At twilight in a small mountain town in Northern California, a clerk in the general store thought she saw a large, hair-covered animal she took to be Bigfoot. Within an hour a large armed crowd had gathered in front of the store, ready to hunt the beast. Investigation showed that the beast was actually a prankster, a high-school boy who had thrown a fur over his head.

From a letter to Deputy Carlson, dated November 25th, 1972: “I believe from reading the article about the Bigfoot search that it is a man dressed in a gorilla suit so people do not kill him, he is probably getting a big kick out of doing his thing, scaring people. The article said it looked like a man. That’s what it was—a man—in costume. If you attend a Halloween dance in costume in Los Angeles you would see plenty of Yeti, dancing with the girls. I’ve seen plenty of these outfits, so do not shoot him, he’s having fun.”

Excerpt from a conversation with a deputy sheriff in The Dalles, Oregon: “Now I’m not saying that a critter like that actually exists. I’ve been hunting this part of the country for almost 20 years, and I’ve never seen hide nor hair of one. But if I did see one, you damn betcha it’s a dead one. It’d be worth more to you alive, but even a dead one would bring you a million for a squeeze of the trigger. And how would you capture one? You couldn’t, is all. Shoot it, is the best way. You’d have a million. I wouldn’t even come to work tomorrow if I shot one tonight. I’d just sit back and start counting my money.”

Sections of County Ordinance 69-01 Skamania County, Washington (located just across the river from The Dalles): “Prohibiting wanton slaying of apecreatures and imposing penalties.

“WHEREAS, there is evidence to indicate the possible existence in Skamania County of a nocturnal primate mammal variously described as an apelike creature or a sub-species of homo sapiens, and

“WHEREAS, both legend and purported recent sightings and spoor support the possibility, and

“WHEREAS, this creature is generally and commonly known as ‘Sasquatch,’ or ‘Yeti’ or ‘Giant Hairy Ape,’ and

“WHEREAS, publicity attendant on such real or imagined sightings has resulted in an influx of scientific investigators as well as casual hunters, many armed with lethal weapons,

“THEREFORE, let it be resolved that any premeditated, willful and wanton slaying of any such creature shall be deemed a felony punishable by a fine not to exceed ten thousand dollars and/or imprisonment in the county jail for a period not to exceed five years.”

This ordinance was adopted in the spring of 1969. On the first day of April to be exact.

Excerpt from a conversation with The Dalles deputy Rich Carlson: “There are always fellows who go out to shoot it. There are people who said they would shoot it if they saw it. In the beginning, one sighting we had, the townspeople found out about it, and by jiminy, they went up there with rifles, ready to hunt it down ….”

Undoubtedly there have been many hoaxes in the Bigfoot saga. In 1968 a Mr. Ray Pickens of Colville, Washington, strapped a pair of 16″, foot-like plywood boards to his feet and tromped over the nearby woods. A small crowd gathered and a photo was sent to Peter Byrne, who dismissed the tracks as obvious fakes. Pickens later admitted the hoax. John Napier states in his book: “I have in my files photographs of a further set of tracks which were clearly made by a hinged wooden contraption which wouldn’t fool the village idiot.”

Another citizen of Colville, the Bigfoot hunter Ivan Marx, made a series of phone calls one night in October of 1970. He was in a state of high excitement. A wounded Bigfoot had been sighted near Colville, and in the morning he was going to go out after it with his camera. As might be expected, a crowd gathered and Marx stayed in radio contact with them. At one point he claimed to have sighted the beast and some minutes later said he was actually filming it.

Peter Byrne said Marx offered to sell the film to Byrne’s organization for $25,000. He agreed to buy on the condition that the film could be studied first for signs of a hoax. Byrne says his study showed that the film had been shot about a month previous to the date Marx claimed and that it had been shot in an entirely different area than that claimed by Marx. Armed with this information, Byrne, the sheriff, and some concerned citizens made a visit to Marx’ Colville home. Marx was gone and there was no forwarding address.

He resurfaced a few weeks ago on the television show You Asked for It. He had shot a film, he said, of a large Bigfoot in a snowstorm and had come to You Asked for It, because he was impressed by the show’s reputation. To my layman’s eyes, the film seems an incredibly clumsy fake. Peter Byrne said it was “ridiculous.” In it, the creature is seen white in a heavy snowfall. It walks manlike, toward the camera, jumps around aimlessly, and gives us a view of his front and back sides. The white gorilla suit bags and wrinkles in the ass.

Most of the known hoaxers seem to be motivated by money, by a desire for notoriety, and by the desire to put one over on everybody, especially the bright boys, the scientists. Journalists, as everyone knows, are beyond these considerations. Through perseverance and knowledge of human nature, I personally obtained an exclusive interview with Bigfoot.

I had put notes up in the local supermarkets and laundromats asking anyone with Bigfoot information to call me at the Oregon Motel in The Dalles. About one AM on a dark and stormy night, I received a call. A hoarse voice with a heavy accent I couldn’t identify asked me if I was the writer who wanted to talk to Bigfoot. I said I was. The voice said, “I am Omah.” He stretched it out, “Ohhhh-mahhhh.” He said he would meet me in 20 minutes at the local Denny’s 24-hour coffee shop. He said I would recognize him because he would wear an ankle-length trench coat and a slouch hat, and because he would be nine feet tall. I suggested he carry a basketball so as not to attract attention.

I dressed quickly and doused my face with cold water. The restaurant was one of those bits of roadside formica with zippy muzak and menopausal waitresses on mother goose shoes. Two truckdrivers discussed Peterbilt rigs near the door. Omah sat in the rear, hunched over a cup of coffee, the hat pulled low over his forehead.

He looked up quickly, almost angrily as I approached the table.

“So why did you call me?” I asked.

He wanted to know if I had done any interviews and what my approach to the story was going to be. I said that I saw him as a survivor, a self-reliant primitive in the midst of vast technocracy; a pleasant reminder that we haven’t yet swallowed up all our wilderness. I said that I saw him as man’s closest brother on the earth and that by knowing him, we could certainly learn to know ourselves the better.

Omah nodded absent-mindedly while I spoke. He called the waitress over and ordered five Lumberjack Breakfasts: “A stack of delicious buckwheat cakes with rich creamery butter and Vermont maple syrup, mounds of hash browns, a giant slab of Canadian bacon, golden brown toast and an assortment of the finest jams; a breakfast fit for a lumberjack.”

While he ate, I pumped him with questions. He had been coming down to The Dalles from Fort Hood every spring for years to raid the apple orchard that is now The Pinewood Mobile Manor. One fateful June, five years ago, he found the orchard gone. In his confusion, he had come on The Dalles Drive-in, which at the time was playing Planet of the Apes. He watched the film three times every night for two weeks. He learned to speak English. And an unshakable idea grew in his mind. Through the long, snowy winters on Mt. Hood he considered. Every spring when he came down to The Dalles, there was a new ape sequel film. This year he was ready to act.

Suddenly he pulled the hat back from his forehead and turned his profile to me. The features were humanoid, but the nose was flattened and the eyes were flat black coals.

“What do you think?” he blurted.

“About me, Omah … Do you think I could get a part in the next ape film?”

He must have seen the look on my face because he stopped talking and stared moodily at his Lumberjack Specials. Mentally I scrapped my survivor story. A great, inexplicable wave of sadness washed over me. We sat in silence for several minutes.

“Been swell talking to you,” I said, and faked an expansive yawn. “Well, I better get back to the motel.”

He looked up and for the first time his humanoid face showed emotion. It seemed twisted into an expression of hopeless pleading.

“I need the ink,” he began, then changed his tack. “Hollywood must know …” I stood up, ready to leave.

His lower lip quivered and for a terrible moment I thought he might begin to cry. We paid the bill and he followed me out the door where we stood for several minutes in the black and windswept Oregon night. He continued to jabber about ape films in his strange accent.

“OK, sure,” he said. There was a distant bitterness in his voice. “Ciao.”",mainstream,M0783c,big.foot
626,"Often called the Southernmost Bigfoot, the Florida Skunk Ape is described as a large, hairy ape-man that gives off a horrendous smell and roams around the state of Florida. Numerous sightings have been reported over the years, with the beast showing up in the day and at night, and in all sorts of environments, although it appears to favor swampy areas [source: Florida Skunk Ape].

Much like Bigfoot, the evidence collected over time consists of photos, hair samples and a few foot casts. (The Skunk Ape apparently has four toes unlike Bigfoot, which has five.) A website devoted to the creature, The Florida Skunk Ape, says it receives several reports of sightings each week. Swamp creatures have long been part of human folklore, so it's probably not surprising that a state with vast tracts of swampland birthed such a myth.",mainstream,M0cf16,big.foot
701,"We all know the rumours to do with its role as indicator of a certain other endowment (doubtlessly spread by members of the clowning community), but what can really be told by one's shoe size? Well, according to scientists and surveys, lots.

Pleasingly, the results show positives for all shapes and sizes. So whether you're a child's size 12, a literal bigfoot or somewhere in between, here's what the experts have to say:

In 2009, a team of Swedish epidemiologists conducted a study into the relationship between shoe size and length of life, even releasing a helpful table to frighten people.

The results generally showed that men with average-sized feet have the best chances, while those at either extreme could find themselves heading for an early grave. Despite that, they did accept a margin of error.

“We have no doubt people can live longer than their shoe size would indicate,” they reassured us in the research paper. “But this would be true only if they adopt an unusually health-oriented lifestyle, with careful attention to diet and exercise.”

Below are their findings; don't say we didn't warn you:

Small-hoofed men breathe a sigh of relief: there is no truth to reports that men with big feet have a large manhood, and countless studies dispelled the myth. One, conducted by University College London, involved 104 men and measured penises both when soft and ""gently stretched"". It concluded the assumed relationship was ""a common misconception"".

Research in Turkey in 2011, however, was less certain. It found a vague correlation between height, weight, BMI (body mass index) and penis size, but not enough evidence to suggest feet alone can determine it.

Instead, it could be your fingers that give away your secrets. South Korean academics last year published a study suggesting men whose index fingers are shorter than their ring fingers are likely to have longer penises. Now you're looking at your hands, aren't you?

It says whether you're a love cheat

The cliché may have been debunked, but there does seem to be some link between shoe size and sex: those with bigger feet are more likely to be adulterous.

According to a poll conducted by Illicit Encounters, the UK's largest dating website for people looking for affairs, the most faithful foot sizes are between 7 and 9, while those wearing 10s (and above) are three times more likely to cheat.

It won't come as a surprise to learn that height and foot size are related – after all, the largest feet in Britain belong to a 6ft 8in rugby player – but there is little evidence to say that it's a direct correlation. What big feet can predict, however, is an imminent growth spurt in teenagers.

""During puberty, the hands and feet enlarge before the long bones,"" states the Harvard Medical School. ""So for many, one of the first indicators that rapid growth is about to begin is an increase in shoe size.""

...but only if the length is in your toes. Relatively long toes compared to the rest of your foot puts a spring in your step when it comes to running fast.

""Sprinters have a stronger, more elastic push off with the toes. And long toes make the overall length of the foot bigger, which means longer contact with the ground, which is where the acceleration happens,"" David Houlihan-Burne, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon said.

For reference, Usain Bolt has size 13 feet: big even for his 6ft 5in frame. The 6ft 1in Justin Gatlin, meanwhile, wears size 12 running spikes, but Tyson Gay? Just a 9. The jury's out on that one, then.",mainstream,M08a27,big.foot

These scenes of World War I action, and thousands more like them, exist today on silent black-and-white motion picture film. Contrary to some widely held beliefs, large, heavy, wooden boxes with crude brass-encased glass lenses, metal hand cranks, and ungainly tripods were, indeed, filming the events of the Great War. In fact, millions of feet of 35mm film were exposed by all the major combatants.

Unfortunately, only a relatively small percentage of that original footage can be found in the world today. Film decay and arbitrary disposal are factors linked to its rarity. For America, these films were shot on location, as history happened, by dedicated and courageous U.S. Army Signal Corps soldier-cameramen.

The films that found their way back with the U.S. Army, along with a few from Britain, France, Italy, Canada, and Germany, are considered official records of the U.S. Government and are preserved at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) as part of what is one of the world's largest film collections, with holdings of more than 360,000 reels of film. Most, but not all, of the World War I titles are cataloged as part of the Records of the Office of the Chief Signal Officer, Record Group (RG) 111, located at the National Archives at College Park, Maryland.

Ever wonder how these historic films found their way to the NARA? This is a short story about the origins and disposition of these classic war pictures and the available finding aids for those interested in the era.

Three months after the United States declared war in April 1917, the U.S. Army Signal Corps was designated as the agency responsible for obtaining photographic coverage of America's participation in the war. The stated purpose of still and motion-picture film documentation was for use in propaganda and in scientific and military reconnaissance, but it was principally for the production of a pictorial history of the conflict.

During July 1917, the Photographic Section was established within the Signal Corps to provide and control all photographic activities within the Army. In an effort to get the unit up and running as swiftly as possible, a photographic officer accompanied Gen. John J. ""Black Jack"" Pershing to Europe in order to study the methods and equipment of the photographic departments of the Allied armies. By the end of the month, a laboratory was secured in Paris, France, for developing and printing both motion and still pictures. This laboratory served until February 1918, when photographic operations were transferred to a larger location in Vincennes.

Starting with 25 men, the Photographic Section attached to the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) grew in strength to 92 officers and 498 enlisted men by the time of the Armistice in November 1918. An operational photographic unit consisted of one motion-picture cameraman and one still-picture photographer, with an appropriate number of assistants. One photographic unit was assigned to each of the American Army divisions as well as to other units attached to higher Army headquarters, special services, and public welfare organizations like the Red Cross and the Salvation Army. Overall, AEF Signal Corps cameramen shot roughly 590,000 feet of film, while motion picture units located in the United States filmed about 280,000 feet of domestic scenes.

A fairly complicated system was developed by the Photographic Section in order to ensure accurate identification of the film shot. Each cameraman was assigned a group of consecutive scene numbers. These numbers were perforated in the leader film of each scene as it was developed at the laboratory in Paris. At the same time, an index file was set up containing the scene identification number and description furnished by the cameraman. Laboratory personnel arranged the scenes supplied by the cameramen into 1,099 subjects (collectively called the AEF series) in chronological order, fully edited and captioned, and shipped them to the War Plans Division at the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. At the War College the captions were verified, and a detailed subject index was prepared. A similar procedure was used with the footage taken in the United States, except that these films were placed into the ""Miscellaneous"" and ""Domestic"" series.

During 1936 and 1937 the AEF, Miscellaneous, and Domestic series films were culled and re-edited by the Army to combine them into a single subject basis series. The result was the ""Historical"" series of films with catalog numbers between H-1100 and H-1558.

At the same time, a new series of ""Miscellaneous"" films was established that contained the photographic histories of the numerous AEF divisions, special films like ""Flashes of Action,"" and other subjects that did not properly fit into the Historical series.

Soon after the National Archives was established in 1934, federal agencies were directed to deposit their archival records there. The Army complied. As a result, the newly re-edited Historical and Miscellaneous films were transferred to the motion picture holdings of the National Archives. Today, these celluloid-based moving images are divided into almost 500 titles, contained on about 1,000 large film reels, and consist of tens of thousands of individual scenes.

To facilitate the use of these films by World War I historians, researchers, documentary producers, and the general public, a landmark finding aid was compiled by a young National Archives archivist named K. Jack Bauer. His work was titled Special List Number 14: List of World War I Signal Corps Films (Record Group [RG] 111). The National Archives and Records Service, as it was known then, published it in 1957. This 68-page, 8-by-10 inch format, green-covered booklet became the principal guide for RG 111, and it has remained so for more than 50 years. It is still recommended by NARA staff for those interested in this time period and is also cited in the 2,428-page, three-volume, comprehensive Guide to Federal Records in the National Archives of the United States (1995). Since the List has been out of print for well over 45 years, copies of this publication are very difficult to find.

I became familiar with the List while doing research for my book War Wings: Films of the First Air War and found it to be an outstanding starting point for my in-depth research.

Detecting a sense of renewed interest in the World War I time period by historians, the general public, and Hollywood, it seemed appropriate to find a way to republish this superb research tool. However, as I began to work on the project, I found myself adding more and more information to the film descriptions based on the original 1920s scripts and catalog cards prepared in connection with the Army re-edit of the films during 1936 and 1937. Further onsite research at the National Archives ultimately more than doubled the numbers of pages of information and added 58 titles to the project. Published in 2007, Battlefilm: U.S. Army Signal Corps Motion Pictures of the Great War was the result.

With the centennial of America's involvement in World War I less than a decade away, it is important for all of us who share more than a casual interest in history to discover and explore all available historical resources. It is also incumbent upon us, as we begin the process of retelling, rewriting, and revisualizing the First World War to generations of people with little knowledge of it, that we include the moving image element. The films located in the Records of the Office of the Chief Signal Officer document a fascinating visual story of the 20th century's first World War—on land, in the ocean, and in the air.

1318,"If you have diabetes, here’s a way to keep standing on your own two feet: check them every day—even if they feel fine—and see your doctor if you have a cut or blister that won’t heal.

There’s a lot to manage if you have diabetes: checking your blood sugar, making healthy food, finding time to be active, taking medicines, going to doctor’s appointments. With all that, your feet might be the last thing on your mind. But daily care is one of the best ways to prevent foot complications.

About half of all people with diabetes have some kind of diabetic neuropathyexternal icon (nerve damage). You can have nerve damage in any part of your body, but nerves in your feet and legs are most often affected. Nerve damage can cause you to lose feeling in your feet.

Some people with nerve damage have numbness, tingling, or pain, but others have no symptoms. Nerve damage can also lower your ability to feel pain, heat, or cold.

Living without pain sounds pretty good, but it comes at a high cost. Pain is the body’s way of telling you something’s wrong so you can take care of yourself. If you don’t feel pain in your feet, you may not notice a cut, blister, sore, or other problem. Small problems can become serious if they aren’t treated early.

Could You Have Nerve Damage?

Anyone with diabetes can develop nerve damage, but these factors increase your risk:
• Blood sugar levels that are hard to manage
• Having diabetes for a long time, especially if your blood sugar is often higher than your target levels

Nerve damage, along with poor blood flow—another diabetes complication—puts you at risk for developing a foot ulcer (a sore or wound) that could get infected and not heal well. If an infection doesn’t get better with treatment, your toe, foot, or part of your leg may need to be amputated (removed by surgery) to prevent the infection from spreading and to save your life.

When you check your feet every day, you can catch problems early and get them treated right away. Early treatment greatly reduces your risk of amputation.

Check your feet every day for cuts, redness, swelling, sores, blisters, corns, calluses, or any other change to the skin or nails. Use a mirror if you can’t see the bottom of your feet, or ask a family member to help.

Wash your feet every day in warm (not hot) water. Don’t soak your feet. Dry your feet completely and apply lotion to the top and bottom—but not between your toes, which could lead to infection.

Never go barefoot. Always wear shoes and socks or slippers, even inside, to avoid injury. Check that there aren’t any pebbles or other objects inside your shoes and that the lining is smooth.

Wear shoes that fit well. For the best fit, try on new shoes at the end of the day when your feet tend to be largest. Break in your new shoes slowly—wear them for an hour or two a day at first until they’re completely comfortable. Always wear socks with your shoes.

Trim your toenails straight across and gently smooth any sharp edges with a nail file. Have your foot doctor (podiatrist) trim your toenails if you can’t see or reach your feet.

Don’t remove corns or calluses yourself, and especially don’t use over-the-counter products to remove them—they could burn your skin.

Get your feet checked at every health care visit. Also, visit your foot doctor every year (more often if you have nerve damage) for a complete exam, which will include checking for feeling and blood flow in your feet.

Keep the blood flowing. Put your feet up when you’re sitting, and wiggle your toes for a few minutes several times throughout the day.

Choose feet-friendly activities like walking, riding a bike, or swimming. Check with your doctor about which activities are best for you and any you should avoid.

Be sure to ask your doctor what else you can do to keep your feet healthy.

When to See Your Doctor

If you experience any of these symptoms, don’t wait for your next appointment. See your regular doctor or foot doctor right away:
• Pain in your legs or cramping in your buttocks, thighs, or calves during physical activity.
• Tingling, burning, or pain in your feet.
• Loss of sense of touch or ability to feel heat or cold very well.
• A change in the shape of your feet over time.
• Loss of hair on your toes, feet, and lower legs.
• A change in the color and temperature of your feet.
• Fungus infections such as athlete’s foot between your toes.

Most people with diabetes can prevent serious foot complications. Regular care at home and going to all doctor’s appointments are your best bet for preventing foot problems (and stopping small problems from becoming serious ones).",mainstream,M121ac,big.foot
377,"It's especially important to look after your feet if you have diabetes. Here's how to take care of your feet and advice on when to get professional help.

Diabetes can reduce the blood supply to your feet and cause a loss of feeling known as peripheral neuropathy.

This can mean foot injuries don't heal well and you may not notice if your foot is sore or injured.

""The risk of complications can be greatly reduced if you're able to bring your blood sugar levels under control,"" says foot specialist Mike O'Neill.

849,"Responding to Samantha Bees’ angry apology Wednesday night for her disgusting and controversial remarks regarding First Daughter Ivanka Trump, Roseanne Barr once again returned to Twitter, only this time not to grovel, but to reclaim her rightful place as a talented and much beloved “A-List” comedian, who mistakenly made a vile remark regarding former Presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett.

However unlike Bee, Barr has paid an extremely steep price, losing her highly acclaimed sitcom show “Roseanne” on ABC, which generated the highest rating in history for a rebooted TV sitcom.

While “C-List” comedian Bee was being celebrated for making a similar vile remark by big-name celebrities, against a backdrop of declining ratings and a mass exit of over a dozen sponsors dropping out of her late-night “Full Frontal” show on TBS, which continues to support her

Barr’s tweets were mostly in response to the thousands of loyal fans fed-up with the blatant “double-standards” and the “hypocrisy” exhibited by the left.

The award-winning comedian is thinking about fighting the show’s cancellation posting; ‘I’m not a racist, I never was & I never will be. One stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights 4 all minorities, against networks, studios, at the expense of my nervous system/family/wealth will NEVER b taken from me.”

Barr continued, “You guys make me feel like fighting back. I will examine all of my options carefully and get back to U.”

Moreover, the remarkable contrast between Bee and Barr was never more evident than within their respective apologies.

Barr’s apology after she realized she had stepped in it; “Guys I did something unforgivable so do not defend me. It was 2 in the morning and I was Ambien tweeting-it was memorial day too-i went 2 far & do not want it defended-it was egregious Indefensible,”

Now contrast that with Bees’ apology, “You know a lot of people were offended and angry that I used an epithet to describe the President’s daughter and advisor last week. It is a word I have used on the show many times, hoping to reclaim it, this time I used it as an insult. I crossed the line. I regret it and I do apologize for that.”

Adding, “I want this show to be challenging and I want it to be honest, I never intended it to hurt anyone, except Ted Cruz. Many men were also offended by my use of the word… I do not care about that. I hate that this distracted from more important issues.”

Quite a contrast indeed and many of Barr’s fans are finally speaking out. Among the tweets that Barr reposted to her account was one from the Twitter user @poconomtn who wrote: “I’m confused. Roseanne’s show was a family show. Her actions place outside of her show. Joy Behar & Jimmy Kimmel do it ON their shows which reflects badly on your network yet you keep them. Don’t pretend this isn’t political.”

Another twitter follower posted; “Normal Americans are watching in absolute shock as leftist maniacs indulge in yet another political sacrifice. It won’t end well for you guys.”

And still another; “In the past 24 hours, Roseanne has attacked the legitimacy of the media, shared Tommy Robinson’s story, and mentioned George Soros and now she is being slandered as an evil racist (#1 top trending). This is an obvious smear job for challenging the authority of the media.”

Kyle Morris another Twitter user asked perhaps the most profound question directed at ABC, the network that fired Barr, asking; “Why ABC didn’t terminate Joy Behar’s contract when she said people who think they can talk to Jesus are “mentally ill”?

No doubt Barr’s outspoken support of President Trump, along with her unconventional hit show poking fun at the progressive establishment is certainly the reason why a majority of Barr’s fans believe that was the real reason for the shows cancellation. The timely remark concerning Jarrett simply helped ABC hide behind it, and claim the network couldn’t tolerate such hateful speech…however “we know better.”",conspiracy,C03184,big.foot; george.soros
451,"Calluses and corns are thickenings of the outer layer of skin. They develop to protect skin from damage against prolonged rubbing, pressure, and other forms of irritation. Calluses and corns usually form on the hands or feet.

Callus. A callus is a thickening of skin exposed to prolonged rubbing. The thickening is evenly distributed. On the hands, a callus may form on a finger due to repeated pressure or rubbing from a pen or pencil, or from playing a stringed instrument. Calluses can also form at the base of the fingers from using gardening tools, playing tennis, chopping wood, or any activity in which you tightly grasp an object. On the feet, calluses typically develop near the base of the toes, where they are caused by friction from the inside of shoes. Some calluses are related to walking problems or foot abnormalities that place unusual stress on parts of the foot during walking.

Corns. A corn is a protective thickening of the skin on the top of the foot, usually on a bony, knobby portion of a toe. Corns often develop because of irritation caused by tight shoes. At the center of a corn is often a dense knot of skin called a core, which is located over the area of greatest friction or pressure. Firm, dry corns that form on the upper surfaces of the toes are called hard corns. Pliable, moist corns that form between the toes are called soft corns.

A callus is a yellowish, flat, hard layer of dead skin. It can cause:

A corn is also a layer of dead skin, usually around the toes. It may have a dense knot of skin in the center of the hardened area. Like calluses, corns can cause:

After prolonged irritation, a brown, red, or black discoloration may develop under a large corn or callus. This is caused by a small amount of bleeding in the space between thick and normal skin. In severe cases, the thick and normal skin may separate, exposing the area to possible infection.

Simple inspection of the hands or feet is often enough to diagnose a callus or corn. Your doctor may ask about your shoes, because shoes with narrow toes are more likely to cause corns. He or she also will ask about the health of your feet and your history of other medical problems, including diabetes and circulation problems. Some types of foot problems can change the mechanics of the foot, causing abnormal pressure on certain areas and leading to calluses. Any previous surgery or trauma to the feet may also affect the structure and alignment of foot bones, increasing the chance of developing a callus or corn.

To find out whether your corns and calluses are related to foot abnormalities, your doctor will inspect your feet for:
• problems related to an abnormal way of walking (gait)

Calluses and corns need treatment by a doctor or other clinician only if they cause pain or other problems. Self-help treatments include:
• wearing gloves or other protection when gardening, playing racquet sports, or doing other activities that put pressure on your hands.
• wearing shoes that fit well, with plenty of room around the toes (wide and deep toe boxes). This reduces the irritation that caused the problem in the first place. Over time, the corns or calluses will shrink on their own. This process often weeks or months.
• cushioning the affected area with moleskin to relieve pressure. You can also make a ""donut"" with moleskin, lamb's wool, felt, or foam. Many pharmacies sell over-the-counter products to cushion corns and calluses.

If a callus or corn gets in the way of activity, or causes pain, there are two main ways to shrink or reduce it:
• Soak the affected hand or foot in warm water to soften the callus or corn. Dry the area. Then rub a pumice stone gently over the callus or corn. Afterward, moisturize the area with skin lotion. Repeat every day or every few days as needed.
• Use an over-the-counter liquid or ointment that contains salicylic acid to soften the callus or corn. Then rub it with a pumice stone to lightly scrape away the dead skin. Be careful with salicylic acid, and follow the instructions exactly, since it can harm surrounding healthy skin. Some foot care specialists advise against using these products at all.

It may be wise to see a food specialist (podiatrist) if a callus or corn makes it hard to walk or do other activities. The doctor may find a structural problem with your feet, or find that you place unusual stress on parts of your foot while walking. If that's the case, he or she may suggest special padding or shoe inserts. Shoe inserts redistribute the forces that cause friction and pressure inside your shoes, relieving some of the stress on your feet when you walk.

If your corn or callus is painful, your doctor may shave away some of the thickened skin to relieve pain and pressure in the affected area.

In rare cases, surgery to correct an underlying problem of bone structure may be needed to treat a corn or callus that keeps returning and is not relieved by padding, shoe inserts, and periodic shaving.

824,"WASHINGTON - For the first time in more than a decade, Native Americans have the opportunity to question presidential candidates on issues of importance to Indian Country.

“This is our chance to tell candidates that they can earn our votes,” said organizer O.J. Semans, co-executive director of the national Native American voting rights organization Four Directions.

Nine presidential hopefuls, Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, former U.S. secretary of housing and urban development Julian Castro, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, Montana Gov., Democrat Steve Bullock, Navajo pastor Mark Charles and author Marianne Williamson say they will participate in the Frank LaMere Native American Presidential Forum.

The two-day event opens Monday in Sioux City, Iowa. Organizers say invitations were extended to candidates from all major political parties, although so far only these nine candidates hoping to unseat President Donald Trump in the 2020 election have confirmed their attendance. The organizers also say talks are continuing with several other campaigns.

Mark Trahant, a member of the Shoshone-Bannock Tribe and editor of Indian Country Today, will moderate a series of panels, giving tribal leaders and Native American youth a chance to air concerns and ask candidates questions on matters of particular importance to Native voters.

Semans expressed delight that many major news organizations will be covering the event.

""For two days, all of the United States is going to know we’re here,” Semans said. “We didn’t get wiped out, we are not extinct, and we have a political voice in which issues that until now have been set on the back burner are now going to be able to be discussed.""

Of the hundreds of issues of importance to Native American voters, panelists will focus on two in particular, said Semans:

The Remove the Stain Act, which Washington Rep. Denny Heck introduced in the House in June as H.R. 3467. If enacted, the bill would rescind the 20 Medals of Honor awarded to members of the 7th Cavalry who on December 29, 1890, murdered nearly 150 Lakota in the Wounded Knee Massacre. The Medal of Honor is America’s highest military honor, given out to members of the armed services who demonstrate outstanding bravery and valor.

“Our second priority issue for the forum is missing and murdered indigenous women and children,” said Semans. “Women and children are sacred to our societies, and in order for us to maintain our societies and cultures, we must do what we were taught, which is to protect women and children, who we are losing in outrageous numbers.”

According to the U.S. Justice Department, Native women are 10 times as likely to be murdered as the national average, falling victim to domestic or drug-related violence, sexual assault or sex trafficking.

The National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center has called on lawmakers to expand tribal jurisdiction over cases of missing and murdered women and children; allocate more resources for victim services; improve data collection and expand tribal access to federal criminal databases, among other measures.

“Actually, underfunding is the fundamental to all these issues,” said Semans. “We wouldn’t have to be discussing funding for our transportation or infrastructure, we wouldn’t have to have discussions on housing and health care and law enforcement if the federal government fully honored the treaties.”

In a related development, Sen. Elizabeth Warren announced Friday she will work with New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland (Pueblo of Laguna) on legislative proposals addressing chronic federal underfunding of tribes, as well as barriers to tribal sovereignty.

The last time Native Americans had a chance to speak directly to presidential candidates was in August 2007 at the “Prez on the Rez” forum on the Morongo Reservation in California. Only three candidates, all Democrats for the 2008 race, participated. Then-New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, former Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich and former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel took part.

This week’s forum is named for civil rights leader Frank LaMere, a citizen of the Winnebago tribe in Nebraska. He died in June.

Co-sponsors include the Native Organizers Alliance, the National Congress of American Indians and the Native American Rights Fund.",mainstream,M0dc66,big.foot

Note: This article is written for professional Intel and those who understand the Secret Space War program, the back engineering of recovered Alien ET technologies, and technologies obtained by treaties and exchange programs. Because VT is committed to open source Intel and believes that the public has a right to know how their taxpayer funds are being spent, especially when used to wage a secret war to hijack their mind, this information is being made available to anyone who is interested with no limitations. If you are not up to speed on this background reading, this article will probably be a waste of your time. There has been significant intercept actions to prevent this article from ever being published. It was suggested to me that I would not be able to ever complete this article or be allowed to publish it, but here it is. I must extend a big thank you to the Editors of VT who have allowed this article to be published and who are deeply committed to open source Intel, making such available to all who are interested in the truth even when it is hard to fathom.

The current state of mind-kontrol is probably far beyond anything you have ever imagined possible.



Mass Mind-kontrol — it’s been going on since the time of Nimrod and ancient Babylonia. And it’s sinister and evil beyond words and description. Since Roswell it has taken a new sinister turn that defies imagination.It’s what empowers the evil Cabal that has hijacked the USG and many of the governments of the world. Some insiders claim it is not of human origin.Cultural and educational methodologies typically have included coordinated efforts to instill certain values, beliefs and attitudes into the societal mass group mind, both conscious and subconscious.for controlling the American Mass Mind for purposes of social control and simulated beliefs and increased sales were readily adopted by Madison Avenue advertising agencies and elements of the USG.Bernays-type methodologies predetermined values, beliefs and attitudes in members of society that caused them to carry certain beliefs and mindsets which predispose them to act in ways that are beneficial to the ruling oligarchical class.It is the oligarchical class – folks who consider themselves “elite bloodline individuals chosen to rule over the masses” – who make certain that the educational and religious systems are instilled in this desired group mind set.

No real academic freedom exists in American Universities, so don’t expect scientists to help you figure out how your mind is being attacked psychotronically.



Despite the illusion of academic freedom in America’s universities, there is none. No classes are ever taught on how the Federal Reserve System is illegal and unconstitutional and how it charges us pernicious usury to use what should have been our own money in the first place.Or that the FRS stole all the US Gold and now replaced real US Dollars with paper debt notes backed by nothing but requiring repayment. Nor does any American University teach that 9-11-01 was a false-flag attack done by the JCS, USAF, NORAD, and the FAA using PNACers, top NeoCons, and Mossad.Doubt this statement that there is no academic freedom in academia in America? Just ask one of VT’s own Editors Dr. Kevin Barrett, or Professor James Tracy, both of whom were illegally and unconstitutionally fired by RKM educational policies adopted by the dupes in charge of faculty.Nor does any American University teach or allow any classes regarding Sandy Hook having been a two-day DHS/FEMA Capstone drill where nobody at all died, or that Adam Lanza never existed, but was a fake construct.Public and private education is designed and deployed to lead We The People away from truth and to instill values, beliefs and attitudes that make it easier for the Satanic Pedophile Network (Ruling Cabal) to maintain rule over us, keep us their secret serfs, and asset strip us blind, until America the Republic is destroyed from within.



 

The Major Mass Media News Cartel is still lying in lockstep about the JFK Assassination.

If you doubt the ability of the RKM’s Crime Cabal, which runs the USG, to control the Major Mass Media to keep the American Mass Mind filled with blatant lies, just consider how, over 50 years later, all the Major Mass Media Broadcast news are still claiming that Oswald assassinated JFK and was a “lone-nut” assassin.

Of course, surveys now show that 60-80% of the American People do not believe this at all, and instead many believe that the CIA, using Op40, did it and it was a major America Coup d’Etat involving GHWB, LBJ, J. Edgar Hoover, General Landsdale, General Lemnitzer, Allan Dulles and many more.

 When you create and control all the money you want, you can buy almost anyone and everyone, and promote those you want to the highest positions of power.

The Ruling Cabal controls the creation and distribution of money and can create all the power they need to implement their policies, which are designed to move mankind along a Globalist path leading to their long-desired Satanic NWO System.

Dark-side Psi-power is harnessed for evil by the ruling Cabal, which is Satanic and deeply committed to an inhuman, anti-human Globalist NWO Agenda that requires 90% depopulation.

Psi-power manipulations of the mass group mind is the little known but real practice of the spiritually based mind-control of the masses through the application of specific Black Arts to “manipulate, fracture and even eventually snatch the human soul” and replace it with non-human spiritual entities from the dark side.

Dark-side Psi-power is the technology used in trauma based mind-kontrol, and the means by which psychopaths and narcissists are inducted into the worldwide Satanic pedophile network in incrementally criminal, anti-human Satanic rituals of abuse, rape, torture and even sacrifice of captive innocent children to gain more and more evil Satanic psi-power.

Some insiders have reported that top cult members receive their own personal “spirit guide” as a consigliere, which periodically appears to them in private and “advises” them after they reach the level of child torture and child sacrifice. Some have claimed these are “Fallen Ones/Lesser Gods”; others claim they are very evil, deceptive and crafty demons or Djinns.



There is the reverse side to Dark-sided Psi-power, which is a spiritual entity. In basic form, it is the spontaneously emerging new populism, which is a direct offshoot of the Internet which is turning out to be the New Gutenberg Press. Some conservative Christians claim they can muster positive Psi-power directly from God Almighty through prayer and faith, and this is reflected in a new and strong desire to do what is right and moral, to serve others, to resist and stop evil and to treat others the way one desires to be treated.I have covered evil psi-power emanating from the ancient Babylonian Talmudic Black arts in prior articles and will get more specific in future articles. But it is so esoteric that it would pose a distraction from the main thrust of this article, which is the new ultra high tech remote mind war that is now being waged against your brain on many fronts, depending on where you reside.There is a secret alliance between Intel and the Ruling Satanic Pedophile Cabal that specializes in Black Arts for Mind War against We The People, Colonel Michael Aquino Style.Col. Michael Aquino, Army Psychological Operations expert and father of the Temple of Set and the entity which brought Satanism as an accepted religion into the US Army, as well as alleged to have run the pedophile operations at the Presidio in California and at Offutt AF Base in Omaha. One insider alleged that Col. Aquino was actually promoted to General of the NSA and still is active.It is now a well established fact that many of the world’s Intel agencies have formed a secret alliance with the worldwide Satanic pedophile network (an oligarchical cult) and has used the trauma-based mind-kontrol conditioning to create MPD/DID sleepers, agents and secret servants in every walk of life, every occupation and even within the Secret Service.In fact the Satanic Pedophile Cult Network (Ruling Cabal) inside America has been deputized as an agent of American national Security, and is used by America Intel as cover for numerous Mind-Kontrol experiments and deep black covert operations.American Law Enforcement is fully compromised by the Satanic Pedophile Network (Ruling Cabal).Every major police department in America as well a every FBI office including the WFO has a sheep-dipped individual who runs interference for the Satanic Pedophile Cabal that rules America.



 

Whenever the phrase “going black”, deep black, or “black operations” is used you can be certain that it always is anti-human, evil, based on ancient Babylonian Black Arts of deception, casuistry, equivocation, and sophistry designed to undermine human character and the natural will of the masses.

The documentation of MK-Ultra and other CIA mind-kontrol programs is so well established and now so public from declassified docs and vetted personal testimonies in front of Congressional Committees, that it is worthless to try and deny the existence of such programs. Every large city prosecutor knows it would be unwise to attempt to prosecute any of the Satanic crimes linked to the Satanic pedophile Network or any Satanic cult crimes or Satanic Ritual Abuse that would create any public cognizance of this issue.

And be certain of this, these MK-Ultra programs which were supposed to have been discontinued after the Church Commission, actually went Black (completely covert inside American Intel inside privatized defense contractors deputized under national security) and are still very active today and even expanding every year.

Back engineered Alien ET technologies have opened up Pandora’s box.

Back engineered Alien ET technologies have opened up Pandora’s box of remote inductive brain entrainment making it possible for Deep Black Intel groups (often buried deep within defense contractors or proprietaries in unacknowledged special access programs) to deploy incredibly sophisticated new weapons of “mindwar” against the American mass subconscious mind.

Ever since crashed UFOs were recovered in 1922 in the Black Forest and in Roswell NM in America in 1947, recovered and back-engineered Alien ET technologies have been a major game changer.

New Psychotronic Mindwar weapons have now been deployed in a secret assault on your brain to entrain it and in many cases on your body to make you physically ill and to shorten your life. The purpose is to help the Satanic Pedophile Network (Ruling Cabal) attain their inter-generational, age old Globalist NWO Agenda of evil which has been their wetdream ever since ancient Babylon.

As the new quantum based physics have evolved into the use of microwaves, pulsed beam microwaves, ELF and scalar (standing waves), it was learned that various sophisticated types of electric induction could be used to remotely entrain the brain to operate at certain desired frequencies.

Voice of God Technology.

And it was also discovered that voices and self-talk, as well as specific belief patterns, could be entrained directly into the brain remotely by use of sophisticated inductive methods, now referred to as advanced psychotronics.

There are numerous vetted and Rock solid reports of the deployment of the Voice of God remote inductive technology being deployed against the Republican Guard in the first Gulf War. This resulted in these Iraqi Soldiers hearing Allah’s voice inside their heads instructing them to throw down their arms and surrender after which hundreds were bulldozed into ditches and buried alive to their deaths.

This weapon system was then tabled not to be used again because the Cabal was concerned it would become too well known and that would lead to the discovery of their other similar weapons which are now being deployed, weapons much more subtle that instill attitudes and beliefs but usually no direct voices.

Some of the new remote entrainment technologies operate by the principal of inter-dimensional or quantum physics, that is immediate remote communication with a target through a medium of a different dimension where the carrier is alleged to be timeless Dimension waves (aka D-waves).



It’s a fact that Mass Mind-kontrol has taken a turn for the worse since Roswell. The new technologies developed from back engineered recovered crashed Alien ET UFOs are so sophisticated and so anti-free will and anti-human that unless taken Deep-Black and protected by numerous layers of “need to know”, extreme compartmenting and special access unaccounted programs, the public would rise up in mass and destroy those programs by whatever means necessary.

Without abject beyond-Black secrecy these sinister Mind-kontrol programs utilizing advanced psychotronics deployed and managed in real time by artificial intelligence, they could never survive intact.

Now for a presentation of current psychotronic weapons now being deployed against the brains of many Americans in select cities and select regions, and some known countermeasures which have been claimed to be effective.

Note: This section is long and those interested can pick and choose the subjects they want.

Some of these weapons such as ELF are deployed against a group of randomly selected citizens and a select group of federal and corporate whistleblowers. One group is used as an innocent control and the other as a group of targeted individuals who in some way are deemed a current or future threat to the Satanic Pedophile Network (Ruling Cabal).

Do not get discouraged and do not lose hope, help is now on the way on several fronts and you can do many things to protect yourself and your loved ones. I have instituted these countermeasures in my home and the homes of various friends and have been pleased with the results, which are backed up by professional quality meters.

As you read about these quite nasty psychotronic weapons now deployed against many of us Americans, please keep in mind that without abject secrecy that is now being denied, these soulless entities who are doing this to us will eventually be stopped cold by the new quite powerful spontaneously emerging populism which is now growing like an out of control wildfire.

Smartmeters and Dirty electricity: Activists claim that Smartmeters (they are digital instead of the old analog) are NOT UL rated like the old analog ones and that these Smartmeters have caused unexpected house fires and there are numerous complaints of much larger electric bills with the same prior usage, numerous complaints about sleeping problems, headaches, nervousness, agitation and various strange illness emerging. In some localities it is a violation to install devise that are not UL rated so folks need to organize into action groups to expose this and stop their use as a public health issue. This ignores the secret mind-kontrol aspects of Smartmeters but to focus on that issue is far too discrediting to ever get anywhere. Few members of the public who are not trained Psyops experts can fathom this unless they have been “targeted individuals” and experienced significant symptoms firsthand. Smartmeters can allegedly be remotely “turned up” to emit large EMF pulsed beam microwave bursts (numerous times per minute) and have been alleged by experts to be able to emit significant or very large amounts of dirty electricity (dirty harmonics) in ones AC circuits.

Counter measures include using grounded stainless steel screen or two thicknesses of grounded aluminum screen wrapped astound the Smartmeter itself, and by hanging an EMF shield of special fabric or two thicknesses of grounded, hanging aluminum screen inside which adequately blocks the inward emissions reaching your bedroom and living quarters. To be sure that you have reduced the EMF you will need to purchase an Microwave detector. There are many good quality ones available for the range of $80 to $400 which will cover Smartmeters (ask the seller which model will suffice). A certified EMF detector may cost up to $2,000 and will tell the difference between regular microwaves and pulsed beam microwaves and in what intensity in microwatts per square meter and a record of accumulation per time period. Smartmeters have been found in some areas to generate large amounts of dirty electrical harmonics in the AC circuits of one’s home. The gold standard for analysis of these AC dirty electricity harmonics is to analyze them with a properly connected AC oscilloscope, a fairly expensive piece of equipment.

I have personally tested my AC circuits for dirty electricity using a Greenwave Dirty electricity meter and after finding very high levels, I then installed Greenwave Electrical Filters which have dual capacitors, are grounded, are UL rated and are RoHC compliant (RoHS, also known as Lead-Free, stands for Restriction of Hazardous Substances. RoHS, also known as Directive 2002/95/EC, originated in the European Union and restricts the use of six hazardous materials found in electrical and electronic products. I prefer the Greenwave meter because it has an audio function that increases in volume with increased dirty electricity and a calculator that estimates the percentage of decrease when you add a filter. There is also the Stetzerizer meter and electrical filters available too which are also popular.

If you cannot afford to get a dirty electrical indicator/meter, one can detect significant dirty electricity and Lilly Waves by turning on an AM radio and moving the dial through the channels. AM channels will be very buzzy or fuzzy and reception will be very poor. For those that cannot afford dirty electricity filters, one can move their bed a bout 3 feet from the wall where the AC wires are, or turn off the breaker covering where they sleep at night. FM is not affected by dirty electricity.

Lilly Waves: In some locales these special behavior and health altering wave forms (a special type of dirty electricity harmonics) are purposely generated by special outside mounted line boxes into your household AC circuits. The purpose is to mind-kontrol you, make you ill, disturb your sleep, make you disturbed, cause relationship conflict with your significant other and break down the family system. This is a deep-black incredibly sinister system that can be detected by dirty electrical meters (Greenwave or Stetzerizer or by using an Osciliscop which is typically quite an expensive piece of equipment). If detected, these waves can be mitigated by the adequate installation of Greenwave or Stetzerizer Filters. The use of large line filters attached to your electrical supply work great but they start at about $5,000 and for most the cost is prohibitive. Use of the small AC filters which are between $25 and $35 each do an effective reducinfg Lilly waves and other forms of dirty electricity including that from Smartmeters if installed correctly.

Remote phones: I have swept a number of homes for EMF using sophisticated accurate EMF meters of several varieties. I have found that in those where the occupants had serious complaints of sleeping issues, headaches, loss of energy or irritability, EMF levels were in the range of up to 4,500 microwatts per square meter, high enough to cause behavioral and health problems, especially in those who may be electro-sensitive. Now here is the strange part.

When I swept a well know federal Whistleblower’s home, I found significant dirty electricity in the AC circuits that were easily reduced down to an acceptable level by the installation of Greenwave Filters. But I also found especially high microwave levels being emitted from his two remote phone base stations which are powerful transmitters. When I mentioned the reading was 4,400 microwatts the level immediately reduced down to about 1,000 microwatts. Later when I crept into the room again it was up at 4,400 microwatts and immediately dropped when I mentioned it verbally.

This of course has alarming ramifications if you think it through. This means that language is being monitored in real time through the remote phone system most likely by use of automatic A.I. I have been told by friends that sometimes they will comment to another person I am going to ask my Smartphone a question only to have the answer given as they recite the first word or two into the phone. It’s like the time an individual told his fiancé he was going to ask his Smartphone what day he would have to turn the clock back for the end of Daylight Savings time. As he recited the first word “when” the Smartphone recited the complete answer to him before he could even speak the question enough to understand it.

This strongly suggests real time A.I. monitoring of all speech patterns within a certain distance of the Smartphone and has alarming implications for not only A.I. base surveillance but also suggests that perhaps Dimensional wave (D-wave) quantum physics have been integrated into some Smartphones and remote phone systems.

Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi has been removed in an increasing number of public schools in Canada and Europe due to significant health concerns for children and their undeveloped neurological systems which can be more vulnerable to the harmful effects of EMF. Pulsed beam microwave transmitters were first installed in a national sporting good chain as a mind-kontrol test which was an NSA proprietary. Several managers and workers with no mental health histories suddenly and unexpectedly “cracked” and had to be taken away by paramedics. The pulsed beam microwaves had been turned up too high and some employees simply cracked from excessive EMF to their brains.

The next place these Wi-Fi systems were installed and tested was in certain select public high schools, especially the one visited by Bush2 when he was president. In one installation I monitored, this Wi-Fi was deployed as a psychotronic weapon system to make some targeted “stand up” highly moral teachers very, very sick. As an adjunct poisonous enzymes were sprayed onto the desks of certain targeted teachers. Some got cancer, some died, some cracked, some just quit. All this covered up under so-called “national security” which was invoked. Other stand up targeted teachers that survived the EMF assaults were then wrongly accused of accessing pornography websites but with no actual proof. In one particular High School where this was done, the administration was linked to Intel and was stealing million of public funds using sophisticated means while running two sets of books. Complaints to the local US Attorney with good evidence supplied and to the US Department of Education Inspector General resulted in an early retirement for the US Attorney and nothing was done in DC either.

The strategy was to drive out any teachers who had strong character and could see what was going on. Good counter-measures for those sensitive to Wi-Fi include hard wiring all computers, eliminating all Wi-Fi especially in one’s home and shielding wall if one lives in multiple dwellings where others Wi-Fi come through with strong signal strength. Wi-Fi has been known to effect some sensitive individuals and can cause the same type of behavioral and health issues that are now linked to dirty electricity, Lilly Waves and excessive EMF in general. We now know for certain that EMF does not have to heat the human cell or human tissue as we have been told for years by the CDC, the USAF and various electrical engineering departments at major Universities to entrain the brain or influence attitudes, beliefs and behaviors.

Cell phone towers: Some experts suggest maintaining a certain distance from these EMF emitters when possible. Those close by cell towers have reported sleeping difficulties, behavioral effects such as irritability, marital conflicts not there before and new unexpected health issues. Insiders have reported that these cell tower systems have been deployed as part of as massive psychotronic war against the American mind to break up relationships and families, make folks sick and to mind-kontrol by remote inductive entrainment. In my city a big mega church was built. Soon after the biggest cell phone tower with the most transmitting antennas installed on it in three levels was built. I noticed that the intensity of the EMF was strangely highest when the church services were being held. I swept the home of a suspected super soldier with an IQ of over 200 living nearby at his request and traced high EMF to the tower and a special dish installed on it aimed at his home. Another pure coincidence I’m sure. Painting and grounding walls will special EMF blocking paint available from www.lessemf.com and other vendors can be effective in reducing cell phone emissions for electro-sensitive individuals or those who are concerned about being too close to cell phone transmission towers.

Radar and Dopplar radar: For years medical effects were denied by the USAF and yet significant proof emerged that those airman exposed to a lot of radar had increased frequency of cataracts and certain cancers. Those too close to these emitters can use grounded screening on interior walls or special grounded EMF blocking paint. The same paint the NSA uses in their SCIFs is now available from numerous vendors like www.lessemf.com. It is fairly pricey but it is a one time expense and some believe it is worth it.

—

Ground based, vehicle based, aircraft based or satellite based microwaves and pulsed beam microwaves aimed and/or triangulated at selected targeted individuals: These systems are expensive to deploy and must be scheduled. therefore they are usually only deployed against whistleblowers or in certain experiments. The usual EMF shielding methodologies like the use of special grounded, metallized primer paints can be quite effective, except for the new X-ray lasers which require much heavier, thicker shielding.

—

Ground based ELF systems aimed and/or triangulated at certain selected individuals: These systems are usually complex working in tandem with other technologies and are deployed against whistleblowers or targeted individuals who have been randomly selected to serve as experimental controls. The talk inside deep Intel circles is that all these systems are still being calibrated and experimented with using A.I. Someday in the future it is expected that the Secret Shadow Government will integrate all this knowledge and turn over control of all the remote inductive entrainment systems to centralized A.I. control run out of the NSA Bluffdale, Utah Base, using the new world’s largest Quantum computer, Vesuvius. Obviously by now most readers have figured out that the NSA is actually run by the same soulless, unimaginably evil Plutocratic Oligarchs from the thirteen Bloodline families who are deploying this Alien ET back engineered/derived psychotronic technology to advance and manage the implementation of their age-old inter-generational Globalist NWO Agenda of pure anti-human evil.

—

Cell Phones and Smart phones: It is now apparent that many of these have real time A.I. interaction-oriented quantum based surveillance powers. Some insiders have alleged that the particular wave forms and frequencies have been designed to entrain attitudes, thought patterns and even beliefs. The jury is still out on this claim, but based on what I have seen so far it wouldn’t surprise me.

Plus there is now a big concern by medical researchers in numerous nations that holding these phones close and making contact with one’s head, like ordinary cell phones and using them too much, can perhaps cause various types of brain cancer. OJ’s attorney Johnny Cochran bragged how he got rid of one of his secretaries after he decided to do all his business by cell phone. He was on it many hours a day, held it close to his head and died of brain cancer soon after the OJ trial ended. Mere coincidence or damage caused by too much, too intense EMF?

There are several ways to mitigate this excessive EMF from Smartphones, just like with ordinary cell phones. Talking with the phone at least 4-6 inches from ones head, use of certain styles of remote earphones, air powered the best, or the use of the speaker phone, ,or use of special fabric pockets which block radiation to the head while talking but still allow the phone to work.

Note: In European health studies by MDs, 3-6% of the populace has been shown to have altered EKGs and EEGs. In at least one Scandinavian nation, EMF sensitivity is a recognized medical disability and a sanctuary city has been set up with highly reduced EMF emissions for those so designated to live in.

Ultra high tech psychotronics, remote mental induction and quantum-based surveillance are the new weapons of war being waged covertly against mankind by the International Satanic Pedophile Network (Ruling Cabal) through the Deep Black unacknowledged, special access Intel cell deeply buried within certain Defense Contractors.

Most of those working on these projects are so compartmented by “Need to Know” that few understand how these devastating weapons of war are being deployed to mind-kontrol and sicken many Americans. Those that do, who sit at the top of the pyramid or run these special access programs, are criminal sociopaths that lost their souls long ago, and most have been initiated into the Satanic Pedophile Network (Ruling Cabal) that runs most of the world.

Now for the difficult conclusion to all this. All MK-Ultra sleeper violence in America (including the real mass-shootings in gun-free zones), and all Radical Islamic violence (ISIS type mercenary forces) are created, paid for, trained, supplied and energized and activated by orders and authorization of the Ruling Cabal. Many so-called radical Islamic mercenaries are not really followers of Islam at all, but have been raised in special camps for abandoned children, mind-kontrolled through drugs, trauma-conditioning and psychotronics at an early age. They, as well as other paid mercenaries, are mind-kontrolled and inducted with psychotic belief patterns that make them easy for the Cabal to remotely activate. They can thus be transformed into savage torturers, heartless rapists and murderers of innocent men, women and children — all done to deliver blood sacrifices to Satan on behalf of the Ruling Cabal to provide them more power as promised by Satan (their words not mine).

Sadly, it’s a fact that many current social movements are by-products of Bernays-type, Madison Avenue social modeling, cultural Mind-kontrol, as well as ultra high tech remote inductive technologies that entrain the human brain and generate synthetic belief patterns and attitudes which cause individuals to acts in ways contrary to their own long term best interests. At little as five years ago, to even discuss these subjects publicly usually resulted in termination as an immediate sanction. Thanks to the Internet and hundreds of honest Intel and LE individuals who refused to keep quiet about these inhuman crimes, the public can now have access to this information, if they so desire. And more and more folks want to know why they are having trouble sleeping, are tired too much, have difficulty concentrating and feel off kilter.



The Cabal’s Plan is part of the Globalist NWO Agenda of Evil to keep experimenting and fine tuning these technologies separately to spy on Americans while mind-controlling them at the same time. Without these devices such as smart phones and Wi-Fi providing desirable features of convenience, few would use them, and the Cabal would not be able to fine tune these technologies.

Once the fine tuning is complete, the Cabal has planned to combine them under control of a massive Quantum computer using A.I. automatic controls and operating through inter-dimensional wave forms. At this point, they believe they will be able to make whole populations completely mind-kontrolled and cloned/hived to the mother A.I. computer; or make sick or even murder whole human populations at will. Then they plan to eliminate 90% of all humans and replace them with their own synthetic race of hybrids, a combination of clay and iron (biology and manufactured electrical components).

Looks like the Cabal has been having some recent bumps in the road with the unexpected side effects of the Internet which has turned out to be the New Gutenberg Press and is now undermining the New Roman Empire run out of the Vatican, which was hijacked by the Black Pope and the Old Black Nobility long ago, the folks that really run the Ruling Cabal. When the Gutenberg Press appeared, it undermined the Vatican by making the Bible available to all — something the Vatican desperately wanted to prevent.

Right now populism has emerged inside America and much of the western world and is growing in power by the day. If not stopped this will be the death of the Cabal’s Globalist NWO efforts.

Never forget — all these various types of Mind-kontrol through these Satanic Black Arts and back-engineered Alien ET technologies do not work well on folks with strong character, integrity and love in their hearts for their fellow man, who have decided to live by the golden rule to treat others the way they want to be treated. It is this immutable human spirit, energized by love towards others, that poses the greatest risk to the Ruling cabal, and cannot ever be snuffed out. I am pretty certain the Cabal will eventually be defanged and stopped and will lose control over these weapons before they can combine them and succeed in their Globalist NWO Agenda of Evil.

Disclaimer: None of this is to be taken as health care recommendations. This article is a mere presentation of some basic information to those who are interested. If you are having problems you think are based on electro-sensitivity to EMF or excessive EMF, you can seek consultation with a qualified expert (there are some but you will have to carefully search them out). Before you come to any conclusions about all these issues, spend some time researching these subjects on the Internet. The references provided are mere starting points. Those who live in European nations will probably find it much easier to get access to scientifically based data on EMF sensitivity and EMF levels one should limit exposure to.

808,"Shirt Ordered For 3-Year-Old From China Came With “Fuck The Pol*ce” Caption

Kelsey Dawn Williamson, a 23 year old mom from Benton, Illinois, bought her daughter a t shirt from AliExpress.com, but ended up getting something a little bit different than she expected. Kelsey was expecting a child sized t shirt featuring characters from the children’s book “Frog And Toad.”

The shirt was just $5 in the “LadyBaby Store” on AliExpress.com, so Kelsey decided to order it for her daughter Salem.

There was no text on the image of the shirt that was shown in the LadyBaby store, and it was described as a “Kids Two Frog Riding Design Baby Boys / Girl T Shirt Kids Funny Short Sleeve Tops Children Cute T Shirt.”

However, when Kelsey received the shirt in the mail, the From and Toad image was on the front, but it also had large text that read, “FUCK THE POLICE.”

Kelsey told Buzz Feed News that she was shocked, but not offended by the shirt. She actually thought that the whole situation was kind of funny.

“I literally did not know how to react so I just took a few moments to stare at it and try to process … Of all the things they could have added, why that? On a children’s size shirt?” Kelsey said.

Kelsey then decided to share the amusing situation with her friends on social media, so she put the shirt on her daughter Salem and took a few pictures. Of course, the child is way too young to read, so she had no clue what it said.

Kelsey posted a photo to Facebook, showing Salem wearing the shirt, with the following caption:

“What I ordered VS what I received. I fucking love China. I cannot stop screaming. WHO DOES THIS.”

It seems that whoever made the shirt took a Frog and Toad “fuck the police” meme that had been circulating on Reddit for use in their design. However, it is not clear if they were able to read English or understand what the message actually said.

Kelsey said that the image quickly went viral after she shared it with her friends.

“I originally just shared the t-shirt with only my friends until one of them wanted to share it to their profile, so I made it public. I definitely wasn’t expecting it to go this far. It all happened so fast,” the young mother explained.

Unfortunately, not everyone had a good sense of humor like Kelsey did. Some people who got offended by the shirt sent Kelsey mean and threatening messages.

“People were actually messaging me just to say mean things about her. A ton of people calling her fat, asking me what I feed her to make her so big, telling me the shirt I bought was too small,” she said.

Some parents might have been angry or offended by getting an item like this, but Kelsey sees it as a memorable experience that Salem will get a laugh out of someday.

“I’ve told [Salem] ‘people really like your frog shirt!’ It’s going in her baby box so we can bring it up when she’s older,” she said.

Sadly, the listing has since been removed from the store, so the shirt is no longer available for purchase.

This is a very similar situation to when English speaking people get Chinese words tattooed on them without actually knowing the true meaning behind the symbols.

Earlier this year, pop star Ariana Grande made headlines after getting a misspelled Japanese tattoo. She intended the tattoo to say “7 Rings” which is also the name of her newest album.

However, when she posted an image of the tattoo to social media, many people recognized that there was a misspelling in the art, and the tattoo actually said “shichirin,” which is a small Japanese barbecue grill.

Grande later clarified that the original photo she posted was an incomplete version of the tattoo that she took while the work was in progress.

Grande says that the pain was so intense because of the location of the tattoo, and that the artwork had to be done in two sessions. Shortly after the controversy caused by her photo, the pop star said that she got the tattoo completed.",conspiracy,C00214,big.foot

After an initial $7.5 billion investment, production is set to start in 2014 at the Jack/St. Malo facility, with a capacity of 170,000 barrels per day (bpd), Chevron said on Thursday.

The U.S. government halted deepwater drilling in the Gulf after the BP Plc (BP.L) well rupture in April that caused the worst-ever U.S. marine oil spill and killed 11 workers.

During the moratorium, the government reviewed industry safety procedures and has formulated some new regulations aimed at preventing another deadly blow-out.

There is still much uncertainty surrounding oil and gas exploration in the Gulf. New regulations are not finalized, and analysts see higher costs and slower progress even for companies with budgets big enough to drill in deep water.

But Mohammad Rahman, at research firm Wood Mackenzie in Houston, said despite the delays, operators would press ahead. “Everybody is aware of the regulations and safety requirements going forward, but they aren’t hindered,” he said.

Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company behind Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), said it would develop the Jack and St. Malo projects at a water depth of 7,000 feet (2,100 metres), about 280 miles (450 km) off the Louisiana coast.

Initial development of the projects will require about $7.5 billion to construct three subsea centers that will tie back to a hub linking the projects, which lie about 25 miles apart.

This will be yet another big investment for Chevron in the Gulf. The San Ramon, California-based company is also due to make a final investment decision on the Big Foot project before the end of this year. The project would produce up to 63,000 bpd.

Big Foot will be built in 5,300 feet (1,600 metres) of water, about 200 miles (320 km) from New Orleans and 35 miles (55 km) south of Chevron’s Tahiti field, a 135,000-bpd development that started up in May 2009.

In 2009, Chevron’s Gulf net daily production averaged 149,000 barrels of crude oil, 484 million cubic feet of natural gas and 14,000 barrels of natural gas liquids.

The Jack and St. Malo fields are estimated to hold 500 million recoverable oil-equivalent barrels. Since 2003, seven exploration and appraisals wells have been drilled in the fields, which are in the Lower Tertiary trend — a geological formation that is below areas drillers have typically tapped.

“The Lower Tertiary is recognized as a huge resource with the potential for long life projects of up to 30 to 40 years and the opportunity to enhance recoveries through technology,” Chevron Vice Chairman George Kirkland said in a statement.

In March, Chevron announced first oil from the Perdido deepwater development, a similar project also located in the Lower Tertiary.

Over the next five to eight years, Wood Mackenzie sees the Lower Tertiary adding 200,000 bpd of production in total, which compares with current deepwater Gulf output of about 1.8 million bpd of oil equivalent, including natural gas.

Chevron has working interests of 50 percent in the Jack field, 51 percent in the St. Malo field, and 50.67 percent in the host facility.

Chevron’s shares closed 23 cents higher on the New York Stock Exchange, outperforming a sector that was dragged down by a 2 percent drop in oil prices.

239,"At the time of writing, Sepp Blatter is not in jail. Nor is he in an igloo or a space shuttle. No, His Holiness is exactly where he should be, still proudly astride his golden throne in Switzerland, contemplating ways to use another term as the hallowed father of Fifa to deliver even more joy and peace to the global footballing family. Amen.

Uefa has decided not to boycott Friday’s presidential elections in the wake of the FBI collaring a – what’s the right collective term here? - brown envelope of Fifa executives; and Britain’s Tory government, renowned for its intolerance of white collar chicanery, has called for Blatter to be replaced to help deodorise a sport that should be known for nothing other than the excellence of players from teams such as Aston Ham and West Harlequins and, oh, you know, all those others sides with great batsmen.

But there are still people brave enough to stand up for the doctrine of Blatter Infallbility. “This is yet another blatant attempt [by the United States] to extend its jurisdiction to other states,” stormed Vladimir Putin, who seemingly ranks suggestions of wrongdoing by Fifa alongside other fictional notions such as Big Foot, unicorns and Ukrainian sovereignty. “It’s a clear attempt not to allow Mr Blatter to be re-elected as president of Fifa, which is a great violation of the operating principles of international organisations,” added Putin, without specifying whether due process should instead involve tanks and surface-to-air missiles.

So that you no longer have to wonder what the head of the Guinea Bissau Football Association makes of all this, Manuel Nascimento Lopes piped up today to reassert his deep faith in Blatter and denounce the diabolical campaign against him. “I’m a Christian and this is blasphemy,” Nascimento Lopes blurted to Insideworldfootball.com, seemingly deifying the Swiss before hastily pointing out that this god is not omniscient: “People say Blatter must have known about this but do I know other people’s secrets?”

‘I’M BIG ON CORRUPTION AND DRUGS IN SPORT’",mainstream,M105e9,big.foot
651,"You'd be forgiven for looking at a pigeon and straining to believe that its ancestors were dinosaurs. This is a creature, after all, that descended from some of the finest killing machines evolution has ever produced to now drink gutter water and assault old people for bread crumbs. But millions of years before birds were bumming for handouts in parks, they had risen right to the top of the food chain. In fact, they filled the vacated niches of their menacing theropod forebears like Velociraptor.

These are the terror birds: scrappy, powerful critters that drove their enormous hooked beaks through small mammals as easily as that guy who put a pickax through my crazy uncle's skull in a bar fight that one time (he survived, and no, I'm not even kidding). The 18 known species, the tallest growing to a staggering 10 feet tall, didn’t bother with flying, instead opting to chase down all those creatures that had only just thrown their good-riddance-to-the-massive-carnivorous-dinosaurs party. The poor things woke up with a hangover, and the hangover was the terror bird.

It was 60 million years ago in South America, which had not yet joined with its northern counterpart, where the terror birds rose to power in isolation as apex predators. Even given their success, their fossils are fragmentary and extremely rare, according to paleontologist Luis Chiappe, who in 2007 described the titanic, strangely boxy noggin of the biggest terror bird ever: Kelenken, named after the fearsome bird spirit of Patagonia’s native Tehuelche people.

“It's the largest known skull for terror birds,” he said. “As a matter of fact, it’s the largest known bird skull, period. It’s about two-and-a-half feet long, an enormous, colossal beast with a very big hook at the end of the beak like an eagle.”

From fossils like these, paleontologists reckon that terror birds were no crumb-loving pigeons, and not just because there was no bread back then. While a skull can’t tell us exactly how it killed, for Chiappe, this is clearly the beak of a carnivore.

“I mean, we know that a little parrot, a cockatoo, can take your finger out,” he said. “Imagine what a bird like this could have done, the damage it could have done with just a strike of this massive skull and beak. So that's obviously one very easy way of imagining this is how these animals killed their prey.”

The terror birds called forests their home, likely lying in wait to ambush the many small mammals that proliferated in South America after the fall of the dinosaurs. But their skulls and beaks probably weren’t strong enough to tackle large prey, biomechanical studies have shown. With their massively developed legs, they would have been more than capable of chasing down scampering critters: These were extremely nimble, swift predators, hitting speeds of perhaps 30 mph. (This shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who has witnessed the surprisingly frantic, not to mention hilarious, way that ostriches run, like giant 40-mph feather dusters having panic attacks.)

At the end of terror bird legs were talons, so it could have been that the beasts fired an initial jab with their beaks, then stood on their prey and rapidly shivved it to death. Or perhaps chomped down on their quarry and shook it until its spine snapped.

And we might also look for clues in the terror birds’ living cousins, the seriemas, for further speculation. These South American birds are only a couple of feet tall, but are nonetheless adept hunters, snagging lizards and rodents and such with their talons and bashing them on rocks to shatter their bones.

It’s even been suggested that the terror birds weren’t terrors at all. Instead, they were full-blown vegetarians, terroir birds, if you will. Last year, German scientists announced the results of a geochemical analysis of terror bird bones, finding that their calcium isotope compositions aligned them more with herbivores than carnivores.

But Chiappe dismisses the notion that such a powerfully built creature was anything but a predator. The terror birds, he argues, sported truly massive heads relative to body size, much like modern eagles and very much unlike modern omnivorous terrestrial birds like emus and ostriches and cassowaries.

“I think that personally you can come up with all these very rather innovative views, but I think that it makes a lot of sense that these animals were predators,” he said. “It’s just the same when someone came up with the idea that T. rex was a scavenger. I'm sure they ate dead meals, but I'm sure it killed.”

“Maybe [the terror birds’] bite force was not strong enough,” he added, “maybe they were limited to preying on certain animals, but that doesn't make them in my opinion a non-predatory bird.”

Whatever their diet, and whatever their methods of feeding, the empire of the terror birds entered a slow decline starting around 4.5 million years ago, when the Central American isthmus formed, joining two heretofore self-contained continents. All those creatures that had evolved in isolation for millions of years now found themselves mingling and schmoozing and shaking hands – with their teeth.

Terror birds made their way up into what is now the southern United States, while North America’s top predators – bears and big cats – colonized South America. “So they had to face new competition for the same resources,” said Chiappe, “and that combined with perhaps changes in climate they may not have been able to cope with and that may have impacted their hunting strategies, probably drove them to extinction.”

And so it is that there’s never been a bird, no matter how terrifying, that a cat couldn’t somehow keep in check. In a way it was a lot like the eternal struggles of Sylvester and Tweety, only with, you know, more murder and fewer speech impediments.

661,"For years, those of us who have tried to warn the American public that Big Brother monitors all Internet users were demonized, vilified and ridiculed.

Now, the mainstream media has proven us correct.

“The U.S. government — and likely your own government, for that matter — is either watching your online activity every minute of the day through automated methods and non-human eavesdropping techniques, or has the ability to dip in as and when it deems necessary — sometimes with a warrant, sometimes without,” ZDNet reported earlier this month. “That tin-foil hat really isn’t going to help. Take it off, you look silly.”

Where’s the proof that the government has this capability?

You might recall a fellow by the name of (retired) Gen. David Petraeus. He’s been in the news lately.

This four-star general-turned-CIA chief just resigned his post after news broke that he had engaged in an extra-marital affair with is biographer, herself a West Point graduate and former Army officer.

What led to this shocking discovery was Petraeus’ use, of all things, Google’s online email service, Gmail.

According to federal law, mind you, authorities are not legally permitted to electronically snoop around in your email box.

“The government can’t just wander through your emails just because they’d like to know what you’re thinking or doing,” Stewart Baker, a former assistant secretary at the Homeland Security Department who’s now in private law practice, told The Associated Press. “But if the government is investigating a crime, it has a lot of authority to review people’s emails.”

Or, in the case of the CIA, if the agency wants to track a suspect ostensibly for “national security” purposes. Ditto the NSA.

The wrangling of Petraeus’ email account has certainly landed him in a world of trouble, but his story has also, once again, ignited a new the debate over when, how and why governments and law enforcement agencies alike are able to access the email accounts of ordinary citizens – even if they head up the most powerful spy agency in the world.

Granted, experts say “the little people” needn’t worry much about having their online presence tracked. Agencies like the CIA generally tend to have bigger fish to fry, so to speak. But nevertheless, the technology to pilfer email accounts at will obviously exists.

“Forget ECHELON, or signals intelligence, or the interception of communications by black boxes installed covertly in data centers,” writes Zack Whittaker for ZDNet. “Intelligence agencies and law enforcement bodies can access – thanks to the shift towards Web-based email services in the cloud – but it’s not as exciting or as Jack Bauer-esque as one may think or hope for.”

How the top CIA official got busted

When he set up his private Gmail account, Petraeus used a pseudonym and composed email messages but never sent them. They were instead saved as drafts. His lover, Paula Broadwell, would then log in under the same account, read the drafts then reply to them in the same manner – as a draft, without actually sending the message.

The exchanges would not be sent across the networks through Google’s data centers, which would make it nearly impossible for the NSA or any other ELINT (electronic intelligence) agency (like Britain’s GCHQ or the Israeli Mossad) to “read” the messages while they are in transit between accounts.

Other sinister operators – terrorists, pedophiles and the like – have been known to use the same trick to avoid detection, ZDNet reported.

“But surely IP addresses are logged and noted? When emails are sent and received, yes. But the emails were saved in draft and therefore were not sent. However, Google may still have a record of the IP addresses of those who logged into the account,” the report said.

In the end, the FBI used a little-know law called the Stored Communications Act, which is part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, as the basis for getting a warrant to view Petraeus’ private Gmail account. And that’s how agents found the stored messages that were never actually sent.

“Once it knew Ms. Broadwell was the sender of the threatening messages, the FBI got a warrant that gave it covert access to the anonymous email account,” the BBC’s Mark Ward reported.",conspiracy,C00a65,big.foot; big.pharma; covid.19
86,"I hope that you'll look beyond Barack Obama and see the bigger picture. The powers that be were happy to trash out the name of George W. Bush; but Bush was just a poster-boy for a criminal syndicate which has taken over the United States. Obama was placed into office with a plethora of newsmedia hype, praise and worship; but the first year of the Obama Presidency has accomplished more evil than all the 8 years George W. Bush spent in office. Already, Obama has increased the national debt more than any other U.S. President in American history. Something is very wrong with that. It's all a big deception. The corporate-controlled newsmedia has led the masses in praise of a politician who is selling us out. I am a CITIZEN of the United States. As such, I love my country. I do not hate anyone; but I hate evil as God commands all believers to do (Psalm 97:10; Ephesians 5:11). There is not a more vile evil in America today than the Socialist policies Barack Hussein Obama will implement over the next few years in America. Respectfully, Obama has lied repeatedly to America and works for the New World Order elite, who hate America. They hate the God of the Bible, Christianity, patriots and the traditional family. Obama promised not to raise taxes; but he did. Obama promised not to propose any laws without first notifying the American public; but he has been secretive about many news laws. Obama broke his campaign pledge not to hire Wall Street insiders; but he has. Obama promised to bring the troops home; but he has sent more. Just like many politicians, Obama promised the rainbow; but delivered something very different. Obama promised change for the positive; but we are experiencing change for the worse. Some have questioned whether Obama is a Communist or not? I can tell you by definition of the word “Communism” that HE IS. One of the definitions of the noun Communism is “a socialist who advocates Communism. ” Obama is an Anti-American, God-hating Communist wrapped in a smile. Obama was not elected; he was chosen and placed into office. I am not saying that Barack Obama is the Antichrist, but it is a Biblical teaching that high political positions will be given by Satan in the End Times... Revelation 13:2b, “and the dragon [Satan] gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.” The Antichrist will have great authority. It is very interesting that President Obama is the FIRST U.S. President to ever be made chairman of the United Nations Security Council . CNN reported that Obama has been called ""The President of the world.” Certainly, the overwhelming international public support of Barack Obama is arguably a form of worship. I believe that the Rapture is very near. Even so, come, Lord Jesus! In his book ""Dream of My Father,"" Obama refers to his Communist mentor Frank Marshall Davis as simply ""Frank, a father figure."" He doesn't even reveal Frank Davis' last name hoping that the public will not find out that ""Frank, a father figure,"" is in reality a firebrand Communist labor agitator who identified himself as a Marxist lecturer and poet in 1964. Starting to get the picture? 

 

 The Chicago group who organized and funded Obama's first two campaigns look like a Who's Who of Communist activities dating from the violent 1960's. Chief among them was Tom Hayden, William Ayers and Bernadette Dorhn. ALL THREE ARE TO THIS VERY DAY UNREPENTANT AND UNAPOLOGETICALLY COMMUNIST AND THEY STILL SUPPORT THEIR FRIEND BARACK OBAMA FINANCIALLY. The American people have once again been duped by a charismatic man who makes a good speech. 

 

 Barack Obama is a Communist by definition and is supported by, funded by and advised by radical left wing Communists who seek to change our form of government from Capitalism to Socialism!!! On the day Obama won the election, I was saddened to see supports waving Communist flags behind Obama on FOX NEWS. In Capitalism, a person keeps what they earn. In Socialism, a person keeps what someone else earns. In Communism, everyone is a slave to the government. Socialism is the Devil getting his foot in your front door. Communism is when the Devil takes control of your home. America's days are numbering before we are NO LONGER a free nation. I am ashamed of my own Independent Fundamental Baptist Church camp in America, who have remained virtually silent about so many evils, particularly in the area of blatant government crimes, corruption and treason. It doesn't require a private investigator to figure out that TRILLIONS of missing taxpayer dollars is unacceptable. After viewing the evidence, only a complete moron would buy into the lie that Islam is to blame for the 911 attacks. “...He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.” —2nd Samuel 23:3 It is a sad day in American history. Few people realize that all of the recent nightmares in the housing and job market were artificially induced by the criminals controlling the Federal Reserve, which is privately owned. It's not federally owned and they have no reserve to back the value of our money. Our money today has no intrinsic value. It is a paper game. Why do you think China is buying up all the world's gold? They're smart and we're not, plain and simple. All of the recent economic troubles in America have been deliberately caused to condition us, to force us to beg for relief from a new leader, and that leader is implementing Socialism as the answer. America is in serious trouble as a nation and now we've got a treasonous Communist as our President.

Any government leader who provides welfare benefits, jobs, healthcare, driver's licenses and education to CRIMINALS who illegally cross our nation's borders is committing treason. Treason by definition means “an act of deliberate betrayal.” When Ronald Reagan allowed General Motors to shut down their Flint, Michigan plant in the late 1980s and relocate to Mexico, that was TREASON. 30,000 American citizens were laid off, many ended up on welfare and General Motors went on to make big profits by exploiting slave labor in Mexico. And the price of automobiles just keeps going up. Allowing Illegal immigration is a deliberate act of treason by our government leaders, as part of the ongoing effort to destroy America's sovereignty and bring about a New World Order, i.e., a Godless Global Totalitarian Communist Police State. It's become so bad that American citizens are now competing with illegal aliens for American jobs. We have been sold out by Democrat and Republican leaders alike. They are traitors.

Freedom is the right to be wrong; not do wrong. Liberty is the freedom to make our own choices; freedom is the result of making the right choices. As Americans continue traveling down their sin-loving path, they are making all the wrong decisions. There could be no corrupt government if the American people were right with God, because they would refuse to tolerate such wickedness. The problem is that only a very small handful of Americans are right with God. People who live in sin become indifferent, apathetic and don't care. Look at those who are the most vigilant and fight the hardest against the evils of our time, and you'll discover that most of them are born-against Christians who love Jesus Christ. It is clear as day that Obama works for the elite Banksters, just as all recent U.S. Presidents... The American people are losing all around. At present, there are 35,000,000 Americans receiving Food Stamps. The unemployment rate is at 16% nationwide. Obama's administration is calling this a “jobless recovery,” but there are no jobs to come back, they've all been outsourced to exploit foreign slave labor. By the year 2012, it is probable that nearly all Americans will work either directly or indirectly for the federal government. Every job that leaves America makes us just that much more dependent upon the government to support us financially. The federal government has taken over the banking, auto, lending and now soon to be, medical industries. Big government is bad for the people. Please don't misunderstand me, I am a firm believer in Romans 13 (which teaches submission to the higher powers). We ought to obey the higher powers. I am not against government, God forbid. I am against corruption, stealing from taxpayers and the blatant evils being done by certain of our top leaders. The U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights is a higher power than the standing government. When any leader(s) violates our Bill of Rights and the U.S. Constitution, they have commit treason against the American public. Instead of being for, of and by the people; government today is for, by and of the corporations. Corporations rule the world. It is just sad that we have lost our once great nation. Ephesians 6:12, “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.” And so it is. The days of little league baseball, hotdogs and innocence are over. Everything today is centered around greed, chemicals in our food, societal paranoia, lying propaganda from the newsmedia, militarized paranoid police, lewdness, dishonesty, fascist-style airport security, illegal drugs brought in by the CIA, homosexuality, et cetera. Everything is so corrupt these days. Government's original intent was to PROTECT our property, our rights and our freedoms, period. It was never intended for the government to educate our children, provide retirement services, give aid to foreign nations, provide healthcare to illegal immigrants, tamper with the economy, provide welfare, et cetera. The average American today has been brought up with the mindset that this is the way it's supposed to be, but it's not. More and more American's are foolishly relying upon the government to solve their problems, whether they be financial, social, educational or moral. Obama is being hailed as a miracle leader, who will bring salvation to the American people; but his methods require increasing government control, which ultimately can only lead to a Communist Police State. 

 According to William Guy Carr, a diligent historian and Commander in the U.S. Navy, every war and revolution since 1776 has been financed on both sides by the monstrous International Banking Cartel... ""While the general public has been led to believe that Communism is a movement of the workers (Soviets) to destroy Capitalism, ""Pawns In The Game"" and ""The Red Fog Over America"" prove that both British and American Intelligence Officers obtained authentic documentary evidence which proved that internationalist capitalists operating through their international banking houses had financed both sides in every war and revolution fought since 1776. Those who to-day compromise The Synagogue of Satan direct our governments, whom they hold in usury, to fight the wars and revolutions so they further Pike's plans to bring the world to that stage of the conspiracy when Atheistic-Communism and the whole of Christendom can be forced into an all-out war within each remaining nation as well as on an international scale. [emphasis added] There is plenty of documentary evidence to prove that Pike, like Weishaupt, was head of the Luciferian Priesthood in his day."" SOURCE: PAWNS IN THE GAME, Introduction, page XVI, by William Guy Carr, 1958 These elite Banksters, all members of the occult, are still working relentlessly today to bring about a New World Order at all cost...

It is important to understand that feminism is a Communist agenda, which began long ago and is intended to ruin America. It was no coincidence that 6,000,000 American women were forced into factories during WWII. It is no coincidence the The Beatles were Communists, who praised Communist Russia in their song ""Back In The U.S.S.R."" The British Invasion in the 1960s brought Rock 'N' Roll's demonic message of rebellion, immoral sex and substance abuse to America. This was all part of the Communist agenda to subvert America from within. Christianity and the traditional family are under attack like never before. Lest you think that sounds like paranoia, consider the following statement by brutal Communist dictator Vladimir Lenin: ""The best revolutionary is a youth devoid of morals."" SOURCE: PAWNS IN THE GAME, page 126, by William Guy Carr, 1958 It is no coincidence that God was banned from the Public School System on 1963, and the unverifiable myth of Evolution is being taught instead to brainwash children. Evolution is a massive fraud. The Big Bang is a big lie of the Devil, a total denial of the Biblical account of creation in Genesis. Hitler's hatred and motive for killing the innocent was rooted in Charles Darwin's teachings on The Origin Of Species. All archeological and historical data on record supports the Bible's claim of divine inspiration from God. And Please read Devilution. “Evidence will be produced to prove that Modern Communism was organized in the year 1773 by a group of International Money-Barons who have used it since, as their manual of action, to further their secret plans to bring about a Totalitarian Godless State. Lenin made this clear in his book Left Wing Communism. On page 53, he said: ""Our theory (Communism) is not a dogma (Settled Doctrine); it is a manual of action. Many modern leaders have said and done the same things as Lucifer did during the heavenly revolution. There is no appreciable difference between Red and Black Atheism. The only difference is in the plans used by the opposing leaders to ultimately win undisputed control of the world's resources, and bring into being their ideas for a Totalitarian, Godless Dictatorship.” SOURCE: PAWNS IN THE GAME, page 4, by William Guy Carr, 1958 I respect the Office of the Presidency. I want people to know that. God is a God of authority. I disagree with those who portray Barack Obama as the joker. I don't think people should do that. I do understand why people are upset; but as Christians we need to always maintain a proper respect for authority. Yet, it is our patriotic, Biblical and personal duty to firmly stand against evil and corruption wherever it rears it's ugly head. There is great power in public opinion. We all need to wake up our families, neighbours and friends with the truth. Mr. Obama is certainly a dynamic and eloquent speaker, and carries himself well; but anytime the government gains more control is a bad thing, which our founding fathers sternly warned us about... ""I believe there are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations."" God cannot bless this mess. It is the American people, and not Obama, who are to blame. Americans are their own worst enemies. Our love for sin as a nation has blinded us to the truth. We get the corrupt leadership we deserve. I don't blame Obama. Yes, he's an enemy to America's freedom and economic health; but we are to blame as Americans for being idiots. Obama is just a puppet controlled by the puppeteers. Obama was chosen; not elected, to the position of U.S. president. We get what we deserve as Americans. We have earned the title of THE GREAT SATAN. The Arab people are correct. There are some Christians who believe that God is judging America by giving us over to a Police State, and that it is proper for America's churches to humbly submit to corrupt government, because this is God's will. I do NOT agree with that. I do believe God has removed His hand of blessing from America because of sin. I do believe that our nation is headed for complete destruction. I do believe that we are bringing judgment upon ourselves as a nation. But I do NOT believe that God wants us to lay down and give up. Although we cannot stop the New World Order from happening, we can certainly fight against the evils of Communism on a daily basis.",conspiracy,C00b78,big.foot

An 8-foot, 300-pound statue of Sasquatch went missing last month from outside Mattress Monsterz in Boynton Beach, Fla., police said Wednesday.

The hard-to-miss figure -- valued at $3,000 -- was stolen sometime between Oct. 6-13, but the owner didn't report the theft until Oct. 20, the Boynton Beach Police Department said on Facebook.

""The store didn't realize it was missing right away due to there being a lot of other large decorations outside for Halloween,"" police said.

There is no surveillance footage of the theft, according to authorities.

1079,"You might not think about your feet, but your feet are thinking about you. Not only do they get you where you need to go, they can actually help cure you of some everyday aches and pains.

Reflexology is an ancient healing practice based on the belief that the foot has multiple reflex points that correspond to different organs and glands in the body.

Pressure is applied to these specific points with specific thumb, finger, or hand techniques. While these movements do feel great on your feet, they also promote good health.

There are certain nerve zones on the foot that deal with headaches. Gently massage your big toe in circular motions to relax your neck. With increasing pressure, focus on the top halves of your toes to pinpoint nerves connected to the head.

By targeting the pituitary gland, you can rid yourself of sleep disorders. Using your thumb, press in and around the planter pad of your big toe (the middle of it). Do this for 1 minute on each toe. You can massage the bottom of your feet with warm coconut oil to help relieve stress and promote better sleep.

One particular technique for relieving stress is call the wrist twist. Make a circle with your thumb and index finger around your thumb (they don’t have to touch). Twist the opposing hand about 20 times and repeat with the other wrist.

To help fight cold and flu, you’ll have to target the nerves that deal with the sinuses, nose, throat, and lungs. On your feet, apply pressure and rub the sides of your big toe, the middle of each toe, and an inch below each toe. You can also apply the same technique to your hands; massage the tips of your finger just above the knuckle.

To help promote proper digestion you can use this simple technique. Using either a tennis or a golf ball, lock your fingers around it and massage the bottom of your palms for 60 seconds. You can also apply this technique to the lower third of your foot on the bottom side.

Back pain is one of the most common ailments suffered by people of all ages. To relieve lower back pain, use your thumb to apply pressure in between the outer ankle bone and your Achilles tendon.

For upper back pain, use your thumbs to massage the arch of your foot, the sides of your feet, and the soles as well.

From helping you relax to relieving you of lower back pain, your feet have the keys to help common ailments people suffer every day. Take care of your feet and they’ll take care of you.",conspiracy,C0329c,big.foot
549,"Chairman of park society wanted to document police misconduct, but was told he had breached Section 44 of the Terrorism Act

Despite police claiming that an ambiguous section of the UK Counter Terrorism Act of 2008 would not outlaw taking photographs or film of police, a man was detained as a terror suspect this week simply for taking a photograph of a police car in order to document police misconduct.

62-year-old Malcolm Sleath, who is chairman of his local park society, saw a police car driving erratically down a North London park footpath, despite the fact that by law police are supposed to investigate on foot in such circumstances.

He began filming the police car to document the misconduct so that he could later present it to the chief sergeant.

Sleath was subsequently approached by the two officers in the car and was told he was being detained because he had breached Section 44 of the Terrorism Act.

“(The officer) was clearly embarrassed to be photographed where he shouldn’t have been and wanted to intimidate me,” said Sleath.

Section 44 previously only allowed police officers to stop and search somebody on “reasonable grounds” but that has now been changed and is no longer necessary, leading to an explosion in frivolous stop and search incidents. 44% of complaints made about stop and search allege assault by police officers.

However, the nature of Sleath’s detainment raises questions about whether police were actually enforcing 58A of the 2000 Terrorism Act, a passage replicated in the 2008 Counter Terrorism Act.

As we have previously highlighted, this section contains ambiguous language which suggests that merely filming or photographing police officers is an act of terrorism. When journalist organizations expressed fears that this law could effectively outlaw a huge part of their profession, they were told by PC Alan Cousins of the Metropolitan Police Film Unit that the law would not impede them.

Cousins stated that taking photos of police officers “would not be caught by this offence,” but added that it could be in “exceptional circumstances”.

In London, filming anything is treated as a sign of potential terrorism. We were filming floral tributes left at the entrance to Stockwell tube station where Jean Charles De Menezes was brutally gunned down by police in July 2005. We were approached by a police officer and subsequently entered into the terror database – ostensibly for filming flowers without permission from the government.

Britain has around 4.2 million CCTV cameras – one for every fourteen people – and Big Brother has carte blanche to watch us 24/7 – but woe betide we actually turn the camera back on the authorities, because that makes us a potential terrorist.

Indeed, a recent London Metropolitan Police poster campaign directly implied that filming a CCTV camera was a probable act of terrorism and encouraged people to report anyone for doing so.

The video below shows UK police threatening a man with reprisals for filming them, claiming that it is an offence to record the police. The cops phone the police station and are told that there is no law that forbids the public from filming them. However, this was two years ago, before the recent amendment to the law was passed.

706,"Milton has named Rodney Wedig as its football coach, Milton athletic and activities director Brian Hammil said Friday.

Wedig stepped down as Beloit Memorial football coach in November.

Milton of the Badger South Conference had an opening after Matt Lee resigned following the season.

“When I stepped down from Beloit Memorial, I had originally planned to step back for a year but when this opportunity presented itself at Milton I couldn’t resist it,” Wedig said Friday in an email to the State Journal. “They have a great football tradition and play in a conference with some of the top teams in the state.

“I feel like this is a program that can compete for championships and that was a big reason I decided to take the job.”

Wedig coached five seasons at Beloit Memorial after a successful tenure at Walworth Big Foot, including winning the WIAA Division 4 state title in 2009 and finishing second in Division 4 in 2008 and 2012.

Beloit Memorial finished 2-7 this past season. After seeing progress, Wedig said before the season he was hoping this would be a breakthrough and potentially playoff season for the Purple Knights. But the season disappointed Wedig, 6-41 in his five seasons at Beloit Memorial.

As a head coach, Wedig holds a 147-107 record. He was coach at Almond-Bancroft for eight years and Big Foot for 11.

Wedig’s son, Matthew Wedig, was a standout tight end, linebacker and punter for Beloit Memorial. Matthew Wedig, a senior, has signed with Illinois State for football.

Milton finished 3-6 overall and 2-5 in the Badger South this past fall. Monona Grove was the conference winner and Milton tied with Monroe and Madison Edgewood for fifth place.

Lee took over in 2016, replacing Bill O’Leary. Milton was 3-6 in 2016 and 3-6 in 2017, giving Lee a 9-18 mark.

Milton hired Rodney Wedig after a lengthy, nationwide search of well-qualified candidates in the offseason, according to a release from the school.

In his career, Wedig led Almond Bancroft’s football team to their first conference title in 2002 and, while coaching Big Foot, was instrumental in putting together a record of 56-6 during his last five years. His tenure at Big Foot included a streak of 48 consecutive conference victories, 11 straight playoff appearances, the two WIAA state runner-up finishes and one WIAA state championship.

“While we had a lot of great candidates apply for the position, Rodney’s depth of head coaching experience, success, enthusiasm for coaching kids and his love of football set him apart,” Hammil said in the release. “I’m excited to have him get started and get to work with our great group of student-athletes.”

In the release, Wedig said: “It is an honor to be selected to be Milton’s next head football coach. I’m excited to meet our players and their families and get to work. I’ve heard great things about the community and the football program and I look forward to leading in a community that has such a strong tradition of great football.”",mainstream,M113db,big.foot
676,"The legendary Bigfoot has long been thought of as the ""missing link"" between apes and humans. In a stunning discovery, scientists have unearthed new evidence of the so-called ""original Bigfoot,"" a 10-foot tall ape that lived nearly 2 million years ago.

Known as Gigantopithecus blacki, researchers discovered that the giant primate lived in southeastern China approximately 1.9 million years ago. They also found that the animal was related to the modern-day orangutan after they conducted groundbreaking, new analysis of proteins in tooth enamel.

""By sequencing proteins retrieved from dental enamel about 2 million years old, we showed it is possible to confidently reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of animal species that went extinct too far away in time for their DNA to survive till now,"" said one of the study's co-authors, Enrico Cappellini, in a statement. ""In this study, we can even conclude that the lineages of orangutan and Gigantopithecus split up about 12 million years ago.""

The research also shows that G. blacki, which weighed up to 595 pounds, diverged from orangutans about 12 million years ago. Unlike chimpanzees or bonobos, it is not closely related to humans.

""With this study, we show that we can use protein sequencing to retrieve ancient genetic information from primates living in subtropical areas even when the fossil is two million years old,"" the study's lead author, Frido Welker, added in the statement. ""Until now, it has only been possible to retrieve genetic information from up to 10,000-year-old fossils in warm, humid areas.""

Welker continued: ""This is interesting, because ancient remains of the supposed ancestors of our species, Homo sapiens, are also mainly found in subtropical areas, particularly for the early part of human evolution. This means that we can potentially retrieve similar information on the evolutionary line leading to humans.""

'BIGFOOT' HAIR SAMPLES TURNED OUT TO BE FROM DEER, NEWLY RELEASED FBI DOCUMENTS REVEAL

It's widely accepted in the scientific community that the lineage between humans and chimpanzees split between 7 and 8 million years ago.

Fossils of G. blacki have been hard to find, with only four partial jaws and thousands of teeth having been discovered.

It's unclear exactly what G. blacki looked like, though recreations have painted it as an oversized orangutan, Live Science notes. Cappellini said the evidence they discovered doesn't provide them any information ""about appearance, phenotype or biology.""

1122,"(CBS News) CHARLESTON, S.C. - Under a shed is Bigfoot Two -- a 60-foot semi-submarine captured by the U.S. Coast Guard in the Caribbean in 2008. It cost just $2 million to build but was carrying $150 million in cocaine.

Vessels like that one are called semi-submersibles because they sail with their tops just above the surface to maintain an air supply for the crew. The semis move cocaine from Colombia to Central America, where it's then transferred by land into the U.S.

7.5 tons of cocaine unloaded from ""narco-sub""

Massive ""Drug Sub"" Seized in Colombia

Inside we found the semi-sub to be a floating warehouse with a huge space for drugs and little else. In the pilot house of the Bigfoot Two semi-submersible are the helm, a compass, the controls, and very cramped quarters for the crew of four.

Another semi-sub was caught by the Coast Guard in September, 2011. While patrolling drug-smuggling lanes, the cutter Mohawk received an intelligence tip and intercepted a vessel near Honduras. When a Coast Guard skiff closed in, the crew scuttled the sub and bailed. The vessel sank in seconds.

With an unknown cache of cocaine resting just 80 feet below the surface, the Coast Guard feared dealers would try to retrieve the lost treasure. So the FBI's dive team was called.

""Part of the whole mission is to deny those drugs the ability to get here to our country,"" said dive team leader Michael Tyms, ""so to leave them there would've left the job unfinished, so to speak.""

Wearing underwater cameras, Tyms and his team cut into the submarine, finding more $200 million worth of cocaine wrapped in waterproof packets.

Now drug runners are moving to a more sophisticated harder-to-detect vessel. Soldiers in Ecuador have discovered some fully submersible submarines along rivers that connect to the sea.

Coast Guard Commander Tom Walsh worries about other groups getting access to that kind of stealth technology. Asked if someone could use a submersible for terrorist activity or arms running, he said: ""That's a very big concern of ours. These vessels would certainly be of value to terrorist organizations that want to move people or equipment or other items towards the United States.""

As for the men who jumped off that semi-sub, they were rescued by the Coast Guard and are now in prison in the United States.",mainstream,M12295,big.foot
275,"Our #SportySista for August is AFL superstar, Lael Kassem (@lael.kassem). This month, we learn about what inspires her to make her move each week for the Auburn Giants AFL team.

“I love that every player has a role to contribute to depending on their strengths. It means AFL is inclusive of all body types, as some are better for sprinting and others are better at tackling. Personally, I love the physicality of the game. It keeps you on your toes as you don’t know where the next tackle is coming from. I love running and sprinting. Aussie Rules gives me the opportunity to showcase my talent, especially on bigger fields.”

“I was excited to play because I followed the game and watched my brothers play. There was never an opportunity for me to play until 2011 when I cofounded the Auburn Tigers, the first Western Sydney Women’s AFL team. At the time, all my team mates, except for the Captain (Kiz) and I, didn’t understand the rules – so we had to teach them. The team relied on my leadership and I was passionate about making sure they enjoyed it. I spent a lot of time working on my mental toughness and the resilience of the team. Champion athletes and champion teams find a way to deal with obstacles and come out stronger and better. In our first season, we engraved the quote “football doesn’t build character, it reveals it” onto the player medals. This was our mindset approaching all barriers we experienced on and off the field.”
• Don’t set limitations on what you can do.
• If it scares you then it means you should do it.
• Don’t wait for others, be the first and go for it.
• It’s okay if you don’t know the rules, all the girls on my team that started didn’t know the rules, and never even watched a game before.



I don’t define my success or highlights by on field success. I think sport plays a bigger role in an athlete’s life off the field. For me, it has allowed me to grow in strides – taught me discipline, resilience and leadership skills. It has been an incredible journey, with many achievements, milestones and experiences that will stay with me forever. At the moment, my main highlight is still to come. I am chasing a big dream to make the AFLW, until then – helping my team, the Auburn Giants win a premiership.”

“I’ll keep working hard, putting my best foot forward in striving for selection in the AFLW. You never know what can happen.



I’m also currently coaching our under 18s girls, so coaching might be another possibility for me in the future.

1241,"The foot is an intricate part of the body, consisting of 26 bones, 33 joints, 107 ligaments, and 19 muscles. The bones and joints in the feet experience wear and tear, so conditions that cause damage to the foot can directly affect its health. This article outlines the basic anatomy of the foot bones, along with some of the most common conditions affecting these bones.

The human foot consists of 26 bones. These bones fall into three groups: the tarsal bones, metatarsal bones, and phalanges. The tarsal bones are a group of seven bones that make up the rear section of the foot.
• The talus, or ankle bone: The talus is the bone at the top of the foot. It connects with the tibia and fibula bones of the lower leg.
• The calcaneus, or heel bone: The calcaneus is largest of the tarsal bones. It sits below the talus and plays an essential role in supporting body weight.
• The tarsals: These five bones form the arch of the midfoot. They are the medial, intermediate, and lateral cuneiforms, the cuboid, and the navicular. The metatarsal bones are a group of five tubular bones in the middle of the foot. They connect to the tarsal bones and the phalanges. The metatarsals sit in a row, and doctors number them one to five. The first one sits closest to the arch of the foot, and number five sits at the outer edge of the foot. The phalanges are the bones in the toes. The second to fifth toes each contain three phalanges. From the back of the foot to the front, doctors call them the proximal, middle, and distal phalanges. The big toe or hallux contains only two phalanges, which are proximal and distal. The metatarsal phalangeal joints are the joints between the metatarsals and the proximal phalanx of each toe. These joints form the ball of the foot. The first metatarsal phalangeal joint sits in line with the big toe. It is a common area for foot pain and other problems.

Common conditions affecting the bones of the feet include: Arthritis can affect many different bones within the feet, but most commonly causes problems with the joints at the base of the big toe. This type of arthritis is known as big toe arthritis. Doctors may refer to it as hallux limitus or hallux rigidus. Big toe arthritis occurs when cartilage in the joint of the big toe begins to wear away. This can happen as a result of many years of repetitive upward movement of the joint. Certain activities, such as prolonged running and walking, can increase a person’s risk of developing arthritis in this area.
• pain, stiffness, and swelling in the big toe
• metatarsalgia, or pain and inflammation in the ball of the foot A bunion is a prominent bump on the inside of the foot, near the base of the big toe. Bunions develop when the bone at the base of the toe — the first metatarsal — begins to separate from the bone at the base of the second toe — the second metatarsal. As the first metatarsal drifts outwards, it causes the big toe to drift toward the other toes. These processes cause the bunion to become more prominent. A person with a bunion may experience pain and discomfort at the site of the bunion or underneath the ball of the foot. These symptoms may worsen when walking or standing. People who develop bunions tend to compensate by carrying more weight on the second toe, which can cause calluses to develop. Gout is a type of inflammatory arthritis. Although it can affect almost any joint in the body, it most commonly affects the joint at the base of the big toe. Gout usually occurs due to a high concentration of uric acid in the blood. Uric acid is a chemical that usually dissolves in the blood and leaves the body through the urine. In people with gout, excess uric acid begins to accumulate and form crystals in the joints. Uric acid crystal deposits can trigger an extreme inflammatory reaction, which causes pain and swelling in the affected area. A hammer toe is a condition that usually affects toes other than the big toe. Instead of pointing straight out in front, these toes point downward, forming a claw shape. In most cases, the condition develops with age. It is usually the result of a muscle imbalance when the long muscles of the lower leg overpower the smaller muscles of the foot. This imbalance causes the toes to bend inward. A hammer toe may cause the following symptoms:
• pain and calluses on the tops of the toes due to friction with shoes
• pain on the tips of the toes due to toes pressing into the sole of a shoe
• metatarsalgia, or pain in the joints at the base of the toes
• a sensation that feels like walking on marbles Heel spurs are bony growths that develop on the heel bone, or calcaneus. Although they may cause some discomfort, they are rarely painful. However, heel spurs often develop as a result of a condition called plantar fasciitis, which can cause pain. Plantar fasciitis refers to inflammation and thickening of the plantar fascia, which is the ligament that supports the arch of the foot. The following factors can increase the risk of developing plantar fasciitis:
• tight calf muscles that reduce the foot’s ability to flex upward
• a very high arch in the foot Plantar fasciitis can cause pain in the heel or bottom of the foot when standing or walking. People who develop heel spurs without plantar fasciitis are unlikely to experience painful symptoms. Heel spurs affect up to one in 10 people. Of these, only half will experience any pain. Sesamoiditis is inflammation of one or both sesamoid bones at the base of the big toe. The condition can cause significant pain in this area. Excessive and repetitive weight on the big toe is the primary cause of sesamoiditis. Factors that increase the risk of sesamoiditis include a sudden increase in activity levels or a change in footwear. People with sesamoiditis may experience the following symptoms:
• sharp and often severe pain at the base of the big toe
• pain and discomfort when walking barefoot or on hard surfaces Stress fractures happen when an area of bone endures excessive and repetitive force. Certain repetitive activities, such as walking and running, can cause microscopic cracks, or microfractures, to develop in the bone. Ordinarily, the body can repair these microfractures. However, sometimes the body is unable to maintain the rate of repair required to keep up with the stress on the foot. When this happens, microfractures can develop into a stress fracture. Certain conditions, such as a lack of thyroid hormone or a deficiency in calcium or vitamin D, can also undermine the body’s ability to heal microfractures.
• the base of the fifth metatarsal
• the sesamoids of the big toe The main symptom of a stress fracture is aching pain in the affected area of the foot.

The anatomy of the foot is highly intricate, consisting of many bones, joints, and ligaments. Some health conditions, injuries, and general wear and tear can all cause or contribute to conditions affecting foot bones. People who experience persistent foot pain or notice changes in the appearance of their feet may wish to see a doctor.",mainstream,M132c3,big.foot
254,"Bigfoot and Wildboy was a live action children's television series on ABC. It began in 1976 as a part of The Krofft Supershow on Saturday mornings. Each episode was 15 minutes long, with cliffhanger endings resolved the following week. It became its own series in 1979 with twelve 30-minute episodes.[1] There were a total of 28 episodes produced.[2]

Bigfoot finds a young boy lost in the vast wilderness of the Northwestern United States. Bigfoot raises the boy who becomes known as Wildboy. Now, eight years later, they fight crime and aliens who show up around their forest home.[3]

296,"I hereby take this opportunity to apologise to my mother for serial dishonesty. Yes, mum: all my shoes were too big for me and, deep down, I knew it. I just really wanted bigger feet.

At Clarks, buying school shoes, I would game the system when the lady made me stand in that giant plastic measuring foot. With the metal ruler chilling the insides of my feet, my stubby toes climbed the tacky surface, hoping to surreptitiously gain half a size.

My flip-flops always flipped off unless I meditated on holding them in place. I remember in sixth form – size six on a good day – sneaking to a shoe shop in Dover to buy size-seven steel-toe Docs. Why go big when you can go monstrous? Such were the fashion foibles of a confused and stubborn trans boy. I persevered despite my mum’s raised eyebrow. She didn’t know what was going on either, except that my shoes were too big and I really didn’t like talking about it.

The thing was that I believed my own hype. In my mind’s eye, every part of me was more broad than in reality. With shoes off, I could only thank my dad’s family line for our wide-set metatarsals. Hobbity feet are at least rugged.

Long after I should have known better, I bought my dream skate shoes in size 7.5. They were the last pair. I remember Mum’s raised eyebrow again, looking at my feet, which seemed to be housed in small fishing boats. As satisfying as it is to reminisce from a point of new-found clarity and self- acceptance, I actually have another confession. Mum, I only found it within me to admit that you were right because I have something better to gloat about. Sunday 12 April was my second T-day. In other words, I’ve been transitioning on testosterone for two years and capricious male puberty’s gift to me is – you guessed it – slightly bigger feet. I realised this while trying, for the first time, to buy shoes that fit. These also happened to be a pair of skate shoes in just the right colour. So, naturally I bought them anyway. Mum, I’ll let you know when you can lower that eyebrow.",mainstream,M0aecb,big.foot
31,"Curse of Bigfoot is a 1975 American horror television film produced and directed by Dave Flocker (credited as Don Fields), and written by James T. Flocker (credited as J.T. Fields).

A high school biology class receives a visitor, who is a good friend of their teacher. He tells them of an encounter that he and their teacher had 15 years before while searching for Indian artifacts in the nearby mountains. They find a mummified corpse in a cave that resembles a rough-hewn statue. The mummy is brought back to their lodge and breaks out of its wrappings. It goes on a short rampage in what appears to be an orchard. The humans gather together to stop the creature before it can kill anyone.

Curse of Bigfoot is an expanded version of a 1958 film made by the same director and writer which was only released in their home town, and was later titled Teenagers Battle the Thing for a video release in the '90s. Two teenagers from the original appear as adults in the opening scene of the 1976 film. The rest of Curse of Bigfoot consists of the entire 1958 film seen as a flashback. The original film focused on the resurrection of a prehistoric monster and had nothing to do with Bigfoot.

The film was released on DVD on 8 July 2008.[1]

On 16 April 2012, Curse of Bigfoot was released as a VOD title by RiffTrax[2]

1062,"HASTINGS, Neb. — Skeptics and believers alike can learn more about Bigfoot thanks to a new museum.

The Crossroads of America Bigfoot Museum in Hastings hosted its grand opening recently. Harriett McFeely, the museum’s owner, said she became interested in Bigfoot after seeing footprints on Mount Everest on TV.

“I was 8 years old and they showed pictures on TV of these footprints that the Himalayan natives called ‘yeti.’ I saw those pictures and never doubted it,” McFeely said. “That was when I got interested in science. I studied science on my own for years. Then, in 1967, Patty walked down Bluff Creek, everybody saw that and I was hooked for life.”

She said she got the idea for the Bigfoot Museum after looking at her dining room table cluttered with Bigfoot artifacts.

“I couldn’t see it. Just about everything that is in this museum I have had in my dining room,” McFeely said. “There were pictures, footprints and everything; it was driving me crazy. I have gone out to different places and given talks. I take different things to groups. I thought it would be so much fun for people to see that.”

The Grand Island Independent reports that the artifacts housed at the Bigfoot Museum include three 2,000-year-old skulls, Bigfoot hand castings and a picture of Bigfoot “Patty” famously walking across Bluff Creek in 1967. She also received hand castings from Cliff Barackman of the Animal Planet TV show, “Finding Bigfoot.”

She added she found a lot of the artifacts in her museum, but others gave her some items as well.

McFeely said she realizes some people are skeptical about the existence of Bigfoot, but she still welcomes them to her museum.

“I like skeptics because they ask really good questions and make you think,” she said. “In all this time, I have only had one skeptic that was really nasty.”

665,"Uganda's growing debt is sustainable, and the country is not at risk of losing state assets to China, the country's finance minister, Matia Kasaija, said this week.

Uganda's auditor-general warned in a report released this month that public debt from June 2017 to 2018 had increased from $9.1 billion to $11.1 billion.

The report — without naming China — warned that conditions placed on major loans were a threat to Uganda's sovereign assets.

It said that in some loans, Uganda had agreed to waive sovereignty over properties if it defaults on the debt — a possibility that Kasaija rejected.

""China taking over assets? … in Uganda, I have told you, as long as some of us are still in charge, unless there is really a catastrophe, and which I don't see at all, that will make this economy going behind. So, ... I'm not worried about China taking assets. They can do it elsewhere, I don't know. But here, I don't think it will come,"" he said.

China is one of Uganda's biggest country-lenders, with about $3 billion in development projects through state-owned banks.

China's Exim Bank has funded about 85 percent of two major Ugandan power projects — Karuma and Isimba dams. It also financed and built Kampala's $476 million Entebbe Express Highway to the airport, which cuts driving time by more than half. China's National Offshore Oil Corporation, France's Total, and Britain's Tullow Oil co-own Uganda's western oil fields, set to be tapped by 2021.

Economist Fred Muhumuza says China's foot in Uganda's oil could be one way it decides to take back what is owed.

""They might determine the price, as part of recovering their loan,"" he said. ""By having a foot in there they will say fine, we are going to pay you for oil. But instead of giving you $60 a barrel, you owe us. We'll give you $55. The $5 you are paying the old debt. But we are reaching a level where you don't see this oil being an answer to the current debt problem.""

Uganda's worries about China seizing national assets are not the first in Africa.

A leaked December report in Kenya showed China was promised parts of Mombasa Port as collateral for financing a $3 billion railway it built from the port to Nairobi. Both Chinese and Kenyan officials have denied that the port's ownership is at risk.

Reports in September that China was taking over Zambia's state power company over unpaid debt rippled across Africa, despite government denials.

1050,"A team of academic and industry researchers led by Jennifer Doudna, the researcher best known for her role in the discovery of the gene editing technology called CRISPR, has turned a 2,500-square-foot scientific laboratory into a facility for running medical tests to detect the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.

The laboratory, which plans to serve hospitals in the San Francisco Bay Area, says it will be able to process more than 1,000 patient samples a day with a 24-hour turnaround, Doudna announced Monday. The lab will ramp up to processing 3,000 samples a day if necessary.

“This is a big, big issue here in the U.S.,” said Doudna. “We need to ramp up testing very fast. It’s been problematic for various reasons. And so we are building and implementing a clinical testing laboratory on the UC Berkeley campus to do exactly that.”

The effort is one more sign of the desperation in major metropolitan areas to ramp up testing for the coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2. Two weeks ago, the U.S. had only processed 42,000 tests over the course of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Covid Tracking Project, a volunteer effort. As of this week, the total number of test results returned has risen to nearly 900,000.

Doudna’s effort isn’t the first in academia. The Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass., began processing test results last week, and said it would be able to process 2,000 tests a day with a 12-hour turnaround.

The new lab is housed at the University of California, Berkeley’s Innovative Genomics Institute, where Doudna is the executive director. It is being run by more than 50 volunteers from Berkeley and its environs, including the chief scientific officer of lab equipment giant Thermo Fisher, team members from Salesforce, the head of commercial at laboratory information analysis firm Third Wave Analytics, and workers from Hamilton Corp., a maker of laboratory robots, two of which are used in the laboratory.

“It’s unbelievable to see how fast this is coming together and people writing software just overnight to put such a complicated pipeline in place and ensure that it’s secure,” Doudna said. “It’s really quite amazing.”

Doudna said that the Food and Drug Administration and the state of California had been willing to relax normal rules to get the effort going. The lab aims to have certification under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (or CLIA) program, the federal regulator of diagnostic labs, by next week, at which point it will begin testing samples. At first, the laboratory will test 300 samples at once, at first working with UC Berkeley’s medical center.

The effort to develop a test began on March 13. The Genomics Institute had been planning to use the space for experiments involving CRISPR, but it already met the safety specifications a laboratory would need in order to handle a contagious virus like SARS-CoV-2. The test is based on the Covid-19 test developed by ThermoFisher, which has received emergency clearance from regulators. and uses a process to conduct the polymerase chain reaction, the basis for all the widely used tests to detect the virus. But the researchers designed a way to use the test on two Hamilton laboratory robots that allowed them to automate the process.

“The throughput numbers assume only one thing: that Thermo supplies and kits do not run out,” said Fyodor Urnov, the genomics institute’s scientific director. He said that the group has already paid a hefty sum for 10,000 of the kits.

Doudna said that her group did a survey of local laboratories, and said that a number of them were running the testing reactions manually.



“Think about that,” she said. “They have no robotics at all. And their turnaround times as a result are up to seven days.”

There is no way, she said, that a manual approach could meet current capacity needs. (Many larger labs are using ready-made systems, such as those made by Roche, Hologic, or ThermoFisher, that are automated.)



“We’ve never faced this before, where clinical labs needed to very quickly be able to ramp up a test so fast,” Doudna said.",mainstream,M0ba5e,big.foot

Instead of looking at rare species and conservation measures, this week's programme focuses on perhaps the most elusive (if not non-existent) creature of all – Bigfoot, the supposed ape like or hominid creature that people believe lives in the North West of the United States. With reports of sightings of strange man-like beasts that go back as far as 1920 if not stretching back into the 18th century, and the 1967 film shot at Bluff Creek in California, there's as much interest in finding evidence of Bigfoot today as there's ever been amongst those convinced of its existence.

528,"A DESPERATE dad revealed his size 19 feet are making his life a misery — and have kept him out of work for nine years.

David Henderson, 39, can’t find smart black shoes that fit so he turns up to job interviews in his enormous white Adidas trainers — the only footwear he can get into.

He says he’s been stuck on benefits for almost a decade as interviewers don’t take him seriously because of his get-up.

And to add to his woes, cruel strangers mock him in the street with taunts like “clown shoes” and “Sideshow Bob”.

The fed-up former security guard searched Scotland for a cobbler who would make him bespoke shoes but drew a blank.

He extended his enquiries across the UK and found a London firm who could help.

But to his horror they quoted him a price of £1,500 — far beyond his means as his Universal Credit payment leaves him just £40 to spend each month after bills.

A pair of size 19 leather brogues could cost as much as an eye-watering £2,000.

Now he’s going public with his problem in the hope it will help him find some decent shoes and get him off the dole.

David, from Methil, Fife, said last night: “My feet have just got wider over time and doctors don’t know why.

“Employers don’t believe me when I say I can’t buy black shoes but it’s impossible to find affordable ones in my size.

“Some interviewers are bemused when I tell them why I’m not wearing black shoes.

“Some are surprised and some are sympathetic. But I can tell some of them are thinking ‘are you for real?’

“I feel like a bit of a tink turning up to job interviews wearing a tracksuit, T-shirt and trainers — but I would look ridiculous if I was wearing smart clothes and my big white trainers.”

David added: “It’s been a total nightmare and very embarrassing. I feel like I have tried everywhere in Scotland but nobody does my size.

“And I get people making fun of me when I’m at the bus stop or walking down the street people say ‘Wow. look at him. Are those boats on your feet?’. Others call me ‘banana feet’.

""It’s demoralising. I think I’d have a job if I had shoes. It brings me down and it’s pretty hurtful.

“I just want to get back to work. I can’t be the only person in the UK with size 19 feet.”

David, who is 6ft 2in tall and weighs in at 24 stone, has had big feet since he was youngster.

When he left school he was a size 16. But he could find shoes that fitted him at the time and worked in retail, cleaning and security jobs through his 20s.

But since then his feet have grown three sizes and are almost 12in long and 7in wide. David says he has been turned down by at least ten employers since he last worked.

His worried girlfriend Annie Jones, 32, said she hopes he can resolve the situation and land a job.

Annie said: “People laugh at him. They point at him and call him names. It’s mean when they call him “clown shoes” and it gets him down.

""I hope he can get back to work. It would mean a lot to him.”

Fox said: “Well, it is a Scotland which has shown itself to be very involved democratically and that is always a very healthy thing, and if the parties in Scotland play their role constructively, there doesn’t need to be division or recrimination or bitterness, which is always the risk after a referendum of this nature.

Distance: 3.2 miles round-trip Just 20 miles outside the metropolis of Guatemala City, 8,373-foot Pacaya is a consistently moody volcano. Pacaya first blew 23,000 years ago and it’s showed no signs of being done. After a relatively brief century of dormancy, Pacaya awoke in 1965 and it has been sputtering ash and lava ever since.

58,"Traveling at nearly 20,000 miles an hour, 1998 OR2 passed within four million miles of our planet last week, or roughly 16 times farther than the moon. While this distance is no cause for concern, 1998 OR2 is continuing on its 3.7-year orbit around the sun, venturing into the asteroid belt beyond Mars and circling back inside Earth’s orbit with each lap. On its next approach to our planet in 2078, it will be much closer, swinging within about a million miles of Earth. After a few hundred years, astronomers can’t calculate exactly where 1998 OR2 will be.

NASA classifies anything over 140 meters (about 459 feet) wide that passes within five million miles of Earth as a potentially hazardous asteroid. “Five million miles comes from how much orbits can change over time, and a little bit of a margin put on it, of course, to be sure that we capture anything that might be a potential impact hazard in the future,” Johnson says.

In just seven years, another huge asteroid called 1990 MU, nearly two miles wide, will pass within three million miles of Earth.

“We don’t want to get hit by something that big,” Johnson says. “Our most important task is finding them and getting a fuller catalogue of everything that’s out there, so we don’t get surprised.”

In 1998, the U.S. Congress directed NASA to detect and characterise at least 90 percent of potentially hazardous asteroids measuring one kilometre (about 3,200 feet) across or larger. Seven years later, the space agency was directed to find 90 percent of nearby asteroids that are 500 feet wide or larger.

The bigger asteroids, including 1998 OR2 and 1990 MU, could devastate life across the planet if they hit. “It is estimated that asteroids of one kilometre or more would result in continent-wide devastation, and the dust injected into the atmosphere would cause drastic cooling and the possibility of global crop failures for at least a few years,” says Jay Melosh, a geophysicist at Purdue University.

We’ve found roughly 900 of these larger objects, or 95 percent of the estimated total population. None are even remotely likely to hit the planet in the next several centuries. But of the smaller group, which could still destroy cities, we’ve only detected roughly 30 percent of the estimated 25,000 objects, according to a report from the National Science and Technology Council.

“These smaller ones—the sub-global sizes that are capable of causing regional problems—we still have a lot of work to do,” Mainzer says. “Searching for these gray or black rocks against the blackness of space—it’s just a hard problem.”

Even space rocks smaller than 500 feet wide can be extremely dangerous. Some meteors explode in the sky with the strength of nuclear bombs, such as one that burst over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013. At only 66 feet wide, this fireball meteor caused a shock wave that hit the city, shattering glass and resulting in about 1,500 injuries. No one saw it coming.

When it comes to stopping an asteroid from colliding with Earth, warning time is the name of the game. With years or even decades to prepare, humans could nudge even the largest asteroids off course.

NASA’s DART mission, scheduled for launch in July 2021, will test one strategy by slamming a half-tonne spacecraft into an approaching asteroid. In October 2022, about seven million miles from Earth, the refrigerator-size spacecraft will approach a half-mile-wide asteroid called Didymos, which is orbited by a 500-foot-wide moon.

“Didymoon,” as the smaller body is affectionately called, is DART’s target. It’s roughly the size of asteroids that can obliterate cities. Ground-based telescopes will be able to detect changes in the duration of its orbit around the larger asteroid to measure the effects of the impact.

“If it wasn’t a binary, it would be basically impossible to measure with high precision,” says Megan Bruck Syal of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who uses a mix of lab tests and supercomputers to model asteroid impacts. ”This is a remarkable opportunity to test the effectiveness of the kinetic impactor technology on a real asteroid.”

Shortly before DART smashes into Didymoon at roughly 14,700 miles an hour, the spacecraft will release a shoebox-size camera made by the Italian Space Agency. The camera will watch as the spacecraft smashes into Didymoon, taking pictures of the spray of debris and perhaps even of the resulting crater. Johnson says he expects the collision could decrease the moon’s 12-hour orbit by as much as seven minutes, although the team will consider the mission a success if that change is at least 70 seconds.

“By changing the orbit of the moon, we don’t change the orbit of [Didymos],” Johnson says. “Didymos is a potentially hazardous asteroid, so we don’t really want to affect its orbit. We don’t want to accidentally push it the wrong direction.”

Another spacecraft called Hera, built by the European Space Agency (ESA), will arrive at the two asteroids in 2026 to take detailed measurements of the impact’s aftermath, as well as test autonomous navigation technologies.

Although a “kinetic impactor” strategy is well understood, a number of variables control whether the impact would successfully deflect an asteroid, Syal says. The target body’s composition, strength and structure, how much material is ejected by the impact, and the angle at which the spacecraft comes in are all important factors.

“A ricochet would be a really poor outcome, meaning a lot of the momentum is lost,” Syal says.

Kinetic impactors might successfully redirect an asteroid as small as Didymoon, but what about 1998 OR2? If something that big were on a collision course with Earth, we’d need a bigger strategy, Lu says—such as detonating a nuclear bomb near the asteroid to vaporize part of its surface and push it off course. A nuclear explosion on the asteroid surface itself would risk creating a shotgun blast of fragments still heading for Earth.

Mainzer, who is leading an effort to launch a space telescope dedicated to finding dangerous asteroids, says the most optimal deflection strategy depends both on the incoming object and on how much time we have before impact. To know what will work, we need to practice.

“We see this with climate change, this pandemic, even this [planetary defence] problem—a small amount of preparation makes a big difference,” Mainzer says.",mainstream,M12899,big.foot; moon.landing
1185,"Of all the discoveries thought by evolutionists to support the idea of human evolution, one of the most sensational is the discovery in 1978 of a 75′ long trail of crisp footprints.

The prints were found in a layer of volcanic ash dated by conventional means to be 3.75 million years old, and assumed to have been made by a human ancestor. Since this date was that of the australopithecine “Lucy,” found in 1974, the discovery was important indeed.



The prints were discovered and defended by the recently deceased Mary Leakey (died December 9, 1996, at the age of 83), Matriarch of the famous fossil hunting Leakey family, whose finds were extensively publicized and funded by National Geographic Magazine. 



Mary Leakey was a tireless worker, whose careful research stands as some of the least controversial in a vicious, ego-laden, funding-driven, field of “one-upmanship.”



As far as the footprints go, her data are not questioned, but the interpretation of the data illustrates the lengths to which evolutionists will go to avoid questioning man’s supposedly evolutionary ancestry.





The prints themselves are quite human-like “indistinguishable from those of modem humans” (Anderson, New Scientist 98:373, 1983). 



Following extensive research it was concluded that the footprints “resemble those of habitually unshod modem humans…. (If the) footprints were not known to be so old, we would readily conclude that they were made by a member of our genus” (Tuttle, Natural History March 1990).



Because of the dates, the prints have been assigned to Australopithecus afarensis, i.e., Lucy’s kind. But is this valid? Lucy was essentially a chimp. Even discoverer Donald Johansson only claims that Lucy was a chimp that walked somewhat more erect than other chimps. 



The Australopithecus foot was an ape’s foot, with an opposing thumb, and long curved toes just right for climbing in trees, but most unlike a human’s foot. According to researcher Dr. Charles Oxnard in a 1996 interview: 



Why do evolutionists continue to maintain that the chimp-like Lucy made the Laetoli human-like footprints, and that both represent our ancestors? Well, it’s certainly not for scientific reasons. The drive to prove man’s animal ancestry is great, for it frees one from accountability to a creator-God.





Thus we see that it is the creationists, not the evolutionists who are the empirical scientists. A human footprint must be made by a human foot!



My evolutionary colleagues could take a cue from Mary Leakey. While a thorough-going evolutionist herself, believing fully in man’s descent from the apes, she had a more cautious approach to the scientific data and especially speculative theory. In an Associated Press interview three months before her death, she “agreed it was impossible for scientists ever to pinpoint exactly when prehistoric man became fully human. 



“We shall probably never know where humans began and where hominids left off” she said. Since scientists can never prove a particular scenario of human evolution, Leakey said ‘all these trees of life with their branches of our ancestors, that’s a lot of nonsense.'”

644,"The two men who claim they've bagged Bigfoot would not reveal the location of the hairy corpse, adding further fuel to skeptics who claim the report is a hoax.

Georgia residents Matt Whitton and Rick Dyer said at a news conference Friday in Palo Alto, Calif., that they no longer know the location of the body, having put it in the care of sasquatch seeker Tom Biscardi, who runs the Searching for Bigfoot, Inc. website.

The two men tried to make their case in front of a skeptical audience as they told a story of stumbling across the corpse in the woods of northern Georgia.

Whitton revealed they had not only found a body, but had also seen several other creatures running in the woods. When asked what the creatures sounded like, Whitten, an officer on medical leave from the Clayton County Police Department, said they did not make a noise.

""They were silent,"" he said.

Whitton and Dyer have so far offered three different tales about how they came to find the creature: In one, the animal was shot by a former felon, and the men followed it into the woods. In a second version, they found a ""family of Bigfoot"" in North Georgia mountains. In the third, the two were hiking and stumbled upon the corpse with open wounds.

Biscardi vowed that DNA evidence would vindicate the men. But he later said that one of the three samples sent for examination came back as human DNA, another was inconclusive, and a third came back as the DNA of a possum, which he said could have been from something the Bigfoot ate.

Even before the three men took the stage, skeptics who had seen the photographs of what looks like a furry creature in a freezer were not impressed.

""What I've seen so far is not compelling in the least, and I think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim,"" Jeffrey Meldrum, a Bigfoot researcher and Idaho State University professor, told Scientific American magazine.

Molluscum contagiosum is common enough that you should not be surprised if you see someone with it or if someone in your family becomes infected. Although not limited to children, it is most common in children 1 to 10 years of age.

People at increased risk for getting the disease include:
• People with weakened immune systems (i.e., HIV-infected persons or persons being treated for cancer) are at higher risk for getting molluscum contagiosum. Their growths may look different, be larger, and be more difficult to treat.
• Atopic dermatitis may also be a risk factor for getting molluscum contagiosum due to frequent breaks in the skin. People with this condition also may be more likely to spread molluscum contagiousm to other parts of their body for the same reason.
• People who live in warm, humid climates where living conditions are crowded.

208,"Dating back to the days of woolly mammoths, humans have been obsessed with larger-than-life mammals. And on the aquatic front, there's no bigger mammal than the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), which is the largest known animal to ever grace the planet.

So Exactly How Big Are Blue Whales?

Adam Ratner, a marine scientist with the The Marine Mammal Center, confirms that ""blue whales are the largest animal on the planet and the largest animal identified that has been on this Earth."" No evidence has been found that any other creature — even the largest of dinosaurs — surpassed the blue whale in size. But wait! What about the Megalodon, an extinct shark species believed to be the largest fish on planet Earth (and which you may recall from the 2018 horror movie The Meg)? Well, scientists guess that even the biggest Megalodon only reached a mere 58 feet (18 meters) (though some argue it was up to 82 feet [25 meters]). By contrast, the largest blue whales clock in at a little more than 100 feet (30 meters) long, and on average are between 75-90 feet (23-27 meters) in length. The largest blue whales live in the Southern Ocean near Antarctica.

Care to take a guess at this hefty creature's weight? 5 tons? Nope. 50? 100? Getting closer, but not quite. The blue whale weighs approximately 400,000 pounds (181,437 kilograms), or 200 tons.

Ratner shares some other startling facts about the blue whale's mass.

All these statistics are daunting, but what do blue whales really look like? They are blue-gray in color — hence the name, though they also goes by ""sulfur-bottom whale"" due to their yellowish underbelly — with lighter gray patches that resemble splotches of paint. The blue whale is part of the baleen whale family — a group of toothless whales — and so its mouth ""contains up to 800 plates of short, wide, black baleen or 'whalebone,' with thick, coarse bristles used for catching food."" Perhaps surprisingly, female blue whales are usually larger than the males.

Because of their enormous size, you'd be forgiven for thinking that blue whales must chow down on some pretty big prey, but that's actually not the case. Despite their massive girth, blue whales rely on very tiny, two-inch crustaceans known as krill as their staple meal. And boy, do blue whales eat a lot of krill.

Ratner shares that ""given their size, blue whales rely on vast quantities of food. Using plates of baleen to filter small zooplankton from the water, they can consume up to six tons, or 12,000 pounds (5,443 kilograms) of krill each day."" He continues, ""In one gulp, the blue whale can take in 125 percent of its body weight of water and krill (250 tons). That is half a million calories!""

Despite all the hubbub over their hefty size, not much is known about blue whales' behavior in group settings, though they are not believed to be aggressive. ""Very little is known about blue whale social structures. We do tend to see blue whales traveling alone or in small groups,"" says Ratner. ""In terms of behavior in the wild, they don't tend to be very belligerent to each other or other animals, but rather focused on feeding or migrating, but again, behavior during breeding season could be very different and is still in need of more research."" But marine biologists are studying one way that blue whales communicate with each other: sound.

""Blue whales produce one of the loudest sounds in the animal kingdom, a low rumble that can be heard hundreds of miles, and even reported to be thousands of miles away in the ocean,"" says Ratner. ""Researchers are still unsure of the meaning of the vocalizations though, with best guesses being around finding mates or signaling opportunities for mating or feeding.""

Jeff Jacobsen, a marine biologist with the Noyo Center for Marine Science, expands on the sounds of blue whales, which scientists use to estimate whale population size, among other factors. When these whale calls are repeated in a sequence, they become known as songs. Only male blue whales sing, however. ""These songs differ by ocean basin, region. Their low frequency calls can be detected at very great distances, depending on ocean conditions,"" says Jacobsen in an email.

The frequency of their songs is affected by noisy conditions caused by objects like passing ships. Blue whales adjust the frequency of songs ""by blowing air through their vocal cords at a faster or slower rate,"" according to a study which was conducted by a group of researchers at Oregon State University and published in August, 2017, after they observed a gradual decline in the frequency of blue whale calls. Scientists are still trying to figure out the meaning of these songs. Though since only males sing, these songs could be a factor in mating and courtship rituals.

If you're curious, you can listen to the sound of blue whales at Blue Whale Vocalization.

According to Ratner, female blue whales give birth to a single baby calf every two to three years, following an 11-month pregnancy or gestation period. These blue whale babes typically are a whopping 25-feet-long (around 8-meters-long) and weigh 7,000 pounds (3,175 kilograms), which is heavier than a mid-size SUV. ""The milk from their mothers is so nutritious that the calves gain 200 pounds (90 kilograms) a day nursing,"" says Ratner.

Little is known about how blue whales mate, however. ""Mating behavior is still being studied, though so far it seems that males defend females from other males. We see impressive surface behaviors during the fall of two males 'fighting' for a female,"" says Jacobsen.

John Calambokidis, a co-founder of the nonprofit Cascadia Research and research biologist who has conducted extensive studies on the movement of blue whales, expands on the whales' possible mating habits, including how they communicate and socialize with each other: ""One feature of blue whales is the extremely loud calls they make, and we have recently discovered these very loud calls are produced only by males, indicating it plays some role in mating or competition with other males."" He notes that blue whales will also form male-female pairs during mating season — notably, with the female leading the pair. Competition for mates can also get a little intense, apparently. ""There is also a competition involving high speed swimming that occurs when more than one male is involved,"" says Calambokidis.

How Many Are There and Are They Endangered?

A blue whale's average lifespan is 80-90 years. However, their existence is increasingly under threat. Blue whales are currently listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. As commercial whale hunting took off in the early 1900s, blue whales dropped from a pre-whaling population of 250,000 to an estimated 10,000-25,000 individuals alive presently, according to Ratner.

Calambokidis, says that ""the [blue whale] population is still under 5 percent of what it was prior to whaling, with most of this decrease from the Southern Hemisphere where blue whales were most numerous.""

Jacobsen agrees, and says that, ""for some reason blue whales were not as impacted by whaling along the [California] coast and we have at least 2,000 individuals here. The population is still recovering around Antarctica."" Jacobsen describes how whales still remain highly vulnerable to collisions with ships, which is how the Noyo blue whale — whose skeleton is being restored at the Noyo Center — was killed. ""For example, it seems that when there are more krill in the shipping lanes, more whales get hit,"" says Jacobsen, citing an article by Oregon State University's Whale Telemetry Group.

Other challenges facing the blue whale include entrapment in fishing gear and climate change affecting the mammal's food sources. But there are some organizations working to make habitats safer for blue whales. Ratner says that the Marine Mammal Center has addressed policies about changing shipping lanes in the San Francisco Bay in order to reduce the likelihood of boats impacting migrating whales. He also suggests that ""individuals around the world can make a huge difference by examining their carbon footprint, and working within their communities (neighborhoods, schools, work) to reduce their use of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas for energy and transportation, as well as reducing their use of single-use plastics, one of the most commonly found items of ocean trash that can pose a threat of entanglement or ingestion for large whales.""

Like many marine mammals, blue whales migrate as the seasons change, but you can find them all over the globe. Ratner says that ""Blue whales are found in all oceans, minus the Arctic, and can be found both on coastal shelves and deep, oceanic waters."" The whales typically migrate toward the North and South poles, traversing ""into colder waters in the summer to feed, while migrating back towards the equator into warmer waters in the winter to [breed],"" says Ratner. But Calambokidis adds that blue whales' migration patterns are slightly more flexible than other baleen whales, like the gray whale. This is mainly because blue whales are always in search of food to satisfy their large appetites, so their movements are geared more toward finding food sources than adhering to strict migratory paths.

Although there are a number of distinct blue whale populations, they can broadly be grouped into those that reside in the Northern Hemisphere and those that are found in the Southern Hemisphere. One of the larger populations in the Northern Hemisphere is the estimated 2,000-something blue whales that feed off the coast of California and migrate to Costa Rica and Mexico, according to the Marine Mammal Center's website.

""Despite being so large, much of their specific movements and behaviors are still unknown to science, though,"" says Ratner of blue whales. It's also somewhat difficult to track them, because the satellite tagging that you might use on other marine mammals — like sea lions — could cause skin infection in whales. Scientists studying whales will often use a more basic photo identification system to keep track of specific blue whales around the world. ""Blue whales, much like many other whales, have unique markings on their skin and can be individuals can be identified by examining photos of whales in different areas of the world providing us a sense of their migration pattern and life history,"" says Ratner.

And, for some good news, according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, blue whale numbers have likely gone up in recent decades. So, things seem to be looking up for the blue giant.",mainstream,M11b5e,big.foot
1027,"Interstellar sources are communicating that cosmic shift is accelerating, and the whole universe is going through a phase transition into the new cosmic cycle. So what we are about to experience is not only the Galactic superwave, but a cosmic shift on the scale never experienced since the creation of the universe.

The Galactic Central sun is becoming more active even at subluminal speeds, as the signal of the previous galactic superwave traveling with the speed of Light is perfectly entrained with the new one that is coming extremely soon:

This is already creating big changes in our Solar system. The Cosmic Central race has created a multidimensional flower of life grid throughout the Solar system that extends from lunar obit outwards to the heliopause. This grid will serve as transmission buffer for the coming superwave.

In their last ditch effort to prevent the shift, the Chimera group have filled the Solar system with as much anomaly and darkness as possible from early 2017 to January 21st, 2019.

Since 2012, the Chimera was leading a strong war against the Resistance and actually managed to fool the Resistance a few times by arranging leaks of incorrect intel to them. For example, the Resistance was scanning the Solar system for any remaining Chimera ships and found none, when in fact those ships were hiding in hyperdimensional wormholes and later staged massive surprise attacks.

This disnfo campaign has a few times lead to some inconsistencies that were posted on this blog. Yet I need to say that Resistance was releasing true intel to best of their understanding and ability, and overall most of intel they have released is valid and correct.

Now Resistance is recovering from all those attacks and a new reinforcement of 50 million new members has arrived from Kuiper belt into the underground network, membership now totaling 120 million. More reinforcements are expected to arrive soon as we come closer to the shift.

The Chimera has realized that they have lost the Solar system and are now concentrated on defending planet Earth and sublunar space as their last fortress.

They are still using toplet plasma bombs as their last line of defense. Top quarks can eat ordinary matter even more efficiently than strange quarks and are far more dangerous than strange quarks:

The plan of Chimera is now to spin limited disclosure into a fake Draco alien invasion that would use TR3-B spacecraft attacking the surface of the planet and the Cabal using the US Space Command as defense against the TR3-B fleet:

In the ensuing chaos, the Jesuits would crash the financial system and implement an AI dystopian surface civilization, similar to what was existing throughout the Solar system in many colonies:

In the last few weeks, certain key positive developments have happened that have effectively stopped this Chimera-Jesuit plan and it will NOT be successful.

He never wrote a book. He never held an office. He never owned a home. He never had a family. He never went to college. He never put His foot inside a big city. He never traveled two hundred miles from the place where He was born. He never did one of the things that usually accompany greatness. He had no credentials but Himself. He had nothing to do with this world except the naked power of His Divine manhood. While still a young man, the tide of popular opinion turned against Him. He was turned over to His enemies.

Because Christianity’s influence is so pervasive throughout much of the world, it is easy to forget how radical its beliefs once were. Jesus’ resurrection forever changed Christians’ view of death. Rodney Stark, sociologist at the University of Washington, points out that when a major plague hit the ancient Roman Empire, Christians had surprisingly high survival rates. Why? Most Roman citizens would banish any plague-stricken person from their household. But because Christians had no fear of death, they nursed their sick instead of throwing them out on the streets. Therefore, many Christians survived the plague. -“2000 Years of Jesus” by Kenneth L. Woodward, NEWSWEEK, March 29, 1999, p. 55.

Created by visual effects artists at Corridor Crew, a Los Angeles-based production company, the four-minute clip blends real-world imagery and cheeky animations to compare SpaceX rockets to some familiar objects.

Who knew the Falcon 9 rocket is as tall as a 21-story building? Or that each of the three Falcon 9 boosters that make up the company's Falcon Heavy rocket is 12 feet in diameter?

And how about the company's planned 348-foot-tall BFR rocket, which will tower over the Statue of Liberty and be as wide as a London bus is long?

And these king-sized rockets may be just the beginning.

""As big as these rockets are, we may see rockets that are even larger,"" says the video's host, Wren Weichman. ""I mean, the BFR is still not as large as the Saturn V rocket which took us to the moon — and we built that 50 years ago.""

No matter what, we've come a long way since the Mercury-Redstone rocket that lofted the first American astronaut, Alan Shepard, into space back in 1961. That rocket stood only 82 feet tall.

467,"After more than seven years of war, which have brought death and destruction, pain and suffering, and every form of terrorism imaginable to the Syrian people, the war is finally entering its final stage. The much-anticipated battle of Idlib will commence soon. The plan to liberate every inch of Syria, which has been stated numerous times by President Bashar Al Assad, is underway.

RT states, “Syrian forces are gearing up to take the last terrorist stronghold. The US is boosting its military presence, and Russia is warning of a false-flag chemical attack. RT looks at the alignment of forces ahead of the battle for Idlib. American warships, cruise missile delivery systems, strategic bombers and other hardware have arrived in the Mediterranean and in the Persian Gulf earlier this week. Washington is denying that any buildup is taking place, but Moscow says the assets are being gathered for a massive strike against the Syrian government.”

The Syrian people have been through unimaginable circumstances, brought on by a western manufactured insurrection, both on the ground and in the media. One would think, that bringing this war to an end, and allowing Syrians to rebuild their lives, would be an objective shared by all humanitarians and activists, but unfortunately, that is far from the case.

Propagandists who pose as humanitarians and activists, while ironically supporting terrorist aligned militant groups, have once again amplified their coordinated media efforts to spread misinformation ahead of the final big battle in Syria.

Journalist and book author Brandon Turbeville writes, “As mainstream media doubles down in its coordinated propaganda against the Syrian government and in support of direct Western military intervention, the alternative media has been going up against unprecedented censorship on the part of the social media and Internet corporate giants at the same time. For that reason, it is becoming harder and harder to find accurate sources of information regarding Syria as well as all other topics in a general Internet search. While readers of the alt media before Google’s purge and censorfest took place have largely remained, the amount of people being exposed to new information and an alternative to government and corporate propaganda has been drastically reduced.”

In order to stay one step ahead of the game, Sputnik goes on to say, “Damascus has handed documents to the UN, to prove that al-Nusra Front* terrorists plan to conduct a chemical weapons attack in the northwestern Syrian province of Idlib and point the finger at the country's government, according to Syria's UN envoy Bashar Jaafari.”

Kester Ratcliff a “Former Project Researcher at University of Bristol” who studies “Top Programme Evolutionary Biology MSc at RUG Groningen” and has previously studied “Animal Behaviour and Welfare Science at University of Bristol”, according to his Facebook page, has created what he calls a “references directory on 151 public figures who have expressed support and/or whitewashed the Assad regime, with examples and references.” He stated, “The purpose of this list is to facilitate finding the references to see and to show people who genuinely don’t know what is true and who to trust about Syria why the people on this list should not be trusted as sources.” Let’s take a moment to digest that last quite bold sentence. The people he cherry picked for his directory should not be trusted according to Ratcliff.

Ratcliff dedicated a substantial amount of time and effort to smearing Vanessa Beeley who has extensive experience working on-the-ground in Syria. In his directory he states “It is my honest opinion that she is manifestly an agent of the Assad regime, that she should be added to the lists of sanctioned persons under the UK and the EU sanctions on Syria, and that she should be arrested if she enters the UK or any EU Member State’s territorial jurisdiction and charged with direct and publicly broadcast incitement of the crime against humanity of widespread and systematic attacks on humanitarian workers in an armed conflict zone, under Article 7(1)(k) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. She responded to Ratcliff’s tweet, with the question on everyone’s mind “Who are you?”

In 1978, a popular English rock band by the name of “The Who” released a song titled Who Are You? One of the lines is, “I remember throwing punches around and preaching from my chair”. What oddly perfect description of Ratcliff, who makes accusations against people he has never met, talked to, or even interacted with, all from the comfort of his chair.

Others on social media asked questions such as what expertise does Ratcliff bring to the table? How qualified is he to tell a broad audience who is trustworthy and who is not when it comes to the Syrian conflict? I am paraphrasing but the point is the same.

One might imagine, that this self-proclaimed “political thinker” (per his Medium bio) must have a background that qualifies him to give an opinion on journalists, political commentators, and other public figures who have contributed written or oral material during the course of over seven years of a western manufactured insurrection in Syria.

However, the questions certainly outnumber the answers in this case. What we can gather is that Ratcliff has never stepped foot in Syria, and relies on second-hand information, such as that from refugees whom he met and coached during his time in Greece.

The ever-evolving man of many interests

Ratcliff gives us more insight into who he is in the few articles he has written and published on various sites. In an essay published by Medium titled “Suffering and the Construction of Authority” Ratcliff wrote about his mother ""I had a mentally ill and abusive mother, grew up as effectively her sole carer. During my teenage years, the most fundamental issue we fought about and the most frequently was that she demanded I should ‘respect her authority’ merely because of her conventional position as my parent, which I could not do because she was actually completely untrustworthy, unreliable and, literally, insane, and in fact I had to practically care for her like a parent would, when I was a child. Practically our roles were reversed, but she insisted on the ‘authority’ conventionally attached to her position. Needless to say, I absolutely refused.”



Ratcliff goes on to say, “That developmental experience made me extra sensitive, vigilant and radically opposed to all forms of authoritarianism in every area of human life. ‘Authoritarianism’ is the idea of ‘authority’ existing for its own sake, inherently possessing its authority, in an alienated way, rather than it being a characteristic of a relationship, in which authority is given and received (inter-subjectively) for certain mutually beneficial purposes.""

You can read more about his views on authority in his essay on Medium where his bio reads: EvoBio MSc student at RUG in Groningen, refugee solidarity volunteer, activist, political thinker.

Ratcliff shares with us the next chapter of his life in the same essay,

He wrote about his Buddhist monk experience for Buddha Channel in an article titled Kester Ratcliff —” Monastic lineages and the Vinaya: Which is Buddhist?” ”I used to be a monk for six and half years in the Thai Forest Tradition, my name then was Bhikkhu Santi. As well as a lot of meditation, in those six years I also did a lot of study and particularly Vinaya, and especially the two main neglected areas -the Bhikkhuni Vinaya and the communal legal procedures (adhikarana-samatha-dhammas).

Ratcliff shares an interestingly similar perspective about the abbots, as that of his mother in the same article.

Ratcliff writes about his experience as a monk and how his journey led him to join the Quakers in an article on his website titled “Mulesika -Seeking the Roots”.

-Ratcliff wrote an article titled Systemic legal issues for refugees in Europe and affected by Europe globally in which he states this is “A list of in-depth sources with connecting notes about the major systemic legal problems confronting refugees as they try to reach a place of safety. The major issues are in order of encounter from a refugee’s point of view.”

-On Ratcliff’s Facebook profile it states that he manages a group called Visas for Asylum or Safe Passage to EU.

-Ratcliff writes about his work with HIAS on his blog Silence of Eternity:

Specifically what I plan to do in Chios next week and the week after:
• Help physically set up the information tent – I’m not sure whether to take my power tools as well as my legal textbooks, but I have both here;
• Try to set up a psychosocially safe, private and dignified environment in which to ask people to recall what happened to make them flee their homes and countries;
• Discuss with them through the Guide I’ve prepared on how to prepare for asylum interviews, clarify their answers with them, and write down their statements ready for them to take in with them to their interviews (this should assist both the refugees and EASO/ the Greek Asylum Service, making the process both fairer and more efficient for everyone).
• If there’s enough time, practice mock interviews with people.
• Connect people whose cases I can’t deal with as a non-lawyer to the network of pro bono refugee legal aid lawyers I’m in contact with now, across NGOs.
• Get a more detailed realistic sense of what’s needed and what works, to feed into the design of the HIAS Greece legal aid programme.”

-Ratcliff wrote a comment in response to an article written by the Sun titled “SYRIA CRIME WAVE: Hundreds of Syrians in UK arrested over string of offences including rape and child abuse, in which he stated

The sole purpose of sharing this article and Ratcliff’s comment is to show that his calls for people to be convicted and imprisoned are nothing new.

In response to an article titled “Spiritual influence” and elections Ratcliff wrote “...the duty to vote and participate in social democracy is a serious public duty which also ought to be considered a religious obligation.""

Ratcliff is in his final-year as an undergrad student of Animal Behaviour & Welfare Science at Bristol University in the Veterinary Sciences School. His current dissertation project revolves around modelling how parasites influence the collective movement patterns that emerge in sheep flocks, using comparative evidence from research in fish.

This brief history based on public information that Ratcliff has generously offered via multiple media platforms might give us some insight about him, but leaves us with more questions than answers. Why has a relatively unknown individual in the Syrian conflict, taken on this task of quietly collecting information on 151 people, and placing a target on each and every one of their backs?

Ratcliff states on a Facebook post that this is his “contribution to the war”. That’s an important point to take note of. Ratcliff is feeling the euphoric effects of overnight fame, but has also made it clear that he does not want people to focus on him as a person or his typos or his lack of credentials. No, it would be best to just blindly accept everything he has stated, without giving it much thought.

Ratcliff knew that this directory would cause a storm of backlash based on some of his facebook posts.

Ratcliff had the help of a retired lawyer friend, and two journalists that helped check his “monster article"", in addition he checked it himself a “bazillion"" times and remarkably still managed to misspell a number of names and get many facts wrong.

Ratcliff doesn't want this to be about him, he says “It’s not really about me"".

Filled to the Brim with Errors, Misspellings, and Inaccuracies

Ratcliff takes a lot of pride in his directory. On Facebook, he stated, “I have checked it very carefully, and endeavored to be fair. Despite hating them, I will not remove anyone or change what I have said about them, in spite of any amount of harassment, so don't even bother trying, but if there is any real factual inaccuracy I will of course immediately correct it.”

Notice how much emotion he expresses towards those he has chosen to blacklist. He doesn’t merely disapprove of their viewpoints, but he hates them as individuals. Emotions can certainly cloud a person’s judgment, and by the looks of it, Ratcliff has no reservations sharing his feelings publicly about individuals whom he has never met or interacted with for the most part. The hate he mentions must have developed during the time that he was lurking in the background, watching and taking notes of who should make his list of untrustworthy sources, as he refers to them.

Ratcliff wrote in a public Facebook post on his page about the typos.

For someone who claims to have checked his directory “very carefully,” it sure was filled to the brim with inaccuracies, and even people’s names were misspelled. Their very identity was wrong. If Ratcliff doesn’t care much for spelling people’s names correctly what else has he not given much thought to in his directory?

Medium has served as a platform for a number of Ratcliff’s essays and incoherent drivel.

Here are just two examples of Ratcliff’s literary balderdash:

-Example of OSINT on 21stcenturywire Vanessa Beeley’s latest Assadist propaganda against the White Helmets - which Ratcliff states is “an incomplete draft from 22 June 2017. I’m publishing it now just in order to send it to another researcher.” He also states “One of Vanessa Beeley’s useful idiots challenged me to “prove it” — obviously they won’t read this or think about it or stop repeating lies, because they don’t believe in objective factual truth, but for the record, here is some proof”.

-Definition and discussion of the meaning and importance of ‘Bullshit’. He states “I wrote this long definition and discussion of ‘bullshit’ to enable me to write a much shorter and simpler paragraph defining it in a major article later.”

His latest contribution has since been suspended by Medium. Their reasons for suspension can be seen in the following tweet.

According to Merriam Webster the definition of a sadist is one characterized by sadism : a person who takes pleasure in inflicting pain, punishment, or humiliation on others. Sadism is defined as the derivation of sexual gratification from the infliction of physical pain or humiliation on another person.

This clarifies why some choose to use the slur Assadist rather than simply saying Pro-Assad when insulting those who have committed one or more of the following “crimes”:

3. speaking up against foreign intervention, imperialism, and terrorism

4. and lastly the most contentious of all according to characters such as Ratcliff...wait for it...actually supporting the elected president of Syria! President Bashar Al Assad ::horrifying gasp::

If these reasons truly qualify one to be called an Assadist then Ratcliff should have included the millions of people around the world who support the legitimate president of Syria Dr. Bashar Al Assad.

Of course using the term Assadist is not original or creative on Ratcliff’s part, nor is he the first to create such a ridiculous list, which could also have dangerous ramifications for those on it. Others have tread these murky waters before Ratcliff, just google Assadist and you’ll see a selection of unimpressive ramblings.

- Louis Proyect wrote about Assadists on his blog The Unrepentant Marxist. In one of his entries titled Young Assadist Academics Nursing their Wounds he stated the following “One of the most depressing things about the six years of war in Syria, besides the obvious destruction of life and property, is the trail of intellectual damage left behind by investigative journalists, leftist leaders, and academics who bend the truth or outright lie in order to defend the mafia state. History will certainly remember people such as Seymour Hersh, Theodore Postol, and Tariq Ali as being ethically and intellectually challenged no matter how virtuous they were in the past.”

One can’t help but wonder if Ratcliff could be Proyect’s protégé? Either way, whether he is or not, doesn’t matter much, but it is interesting to see the similarities between the two, especially their love of using the same slurs and list-making passion.

What a useful tool their contributions must be to terrorist aligned opposition groups who are seeking to shut down dissenters especially during this last phase of a war...which they have clearly lost.

Ratcliff has been sharing articles written in response to his directory on his social media accounts with uber-enthusiasm. Overnight fame can be exhilarating and Ratcliff is enjoying every millisecond of his five minutes of fame.

Ratcliff’s greatest accomplishment thus far, could very well be getting the attention of RT which resulted in not one, but three articles being published in a span of two days, in response to his Assadist directory.

- August 27th: Chomsky, Hersh and... Boris Johnson? Twitter pundits ponder odd 'Assadist' blacklist “An obscure blog post, that accuses journalists and intellectuals of inciting “crimes against humanity” for their views on Syria, has received glowing reviews from verified Twitter pundits, despite its factually dubious claims. Featured on an unfrequented Medium blog, the “International Assadists References Directory” lists 151 people and organizations who have allegedly “expressed support and/or whitewashed the Assad regime.” The eclectic compilation of “Assadists” features individuals and groups of all political stripes and backgrounds, from the Greek nationalist political party Golden Dawn to Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters. Notable journalists such as Seymour Hersh, John Pilger, Peter Hitchens, Glenn Greenwald and Patrick Cockburn are also listed as reckless Assad apologists.”

- August 28th: Don’t tell him, Pike! The laughable (yet sinister) list of ‘International Assadists’

Neil Clark wrote “A newly-compiled directory of 151 ‘International Assadists’ is both hilarious - for all the mistakes in it, but disturbing too, as it represents a McCarthyite attempt to police the debate on Syria.”

He goes on to say “By Ratcliff’s own admission you don’t even have to be ‘pro-Assad’ to be included in his ‘International Assadists ReferenceDirectory’. His definition of ‘Assadist’ is incredibly wide - so wide in fact that it even includes those who have supported air strikes on Syrian government targets. Here he quotes Ratcliff as having written “All pro-Assad people are Assadists (they repeat Assadist propaganda claims), but not all Assadists are in their own view pro-Assad,” he explains in the introduction. In other words, if you repeat anything on Syria that he regards as an “Assadist propaganda claim”, you’re an Assadist. Even if you make it clear you strongly oppose the Syrian president - and support bombing Syrian airfields, like former UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who is listed.”

- August 28th ‘Assadist list’ nothing more than McCarthyism paired with ‘hoodwink’ science George Galloway wrote “Yet I have made the Assadist List, compiled by a student scribbler, a Kester Ratcliff, whose name needn’t detain us for long. He is his masters’ voice and his masters are whom we should focus on.”

Responses from some of the “Assadists” in Ratcliff’s directory

If poppycock isn’t your literary preference, and you have an appetite for truthful, honest reporting and journalism, might I suggest you read the following refreshing list of sources that have covered the war in Syria in many different capacities.

Brandon Turbeville is an exceptional journalist and accomplished author of seven books. Turbeville has first-hand experience from visiting Syria which only adds to the verity of his articles. Turbeville has published 1000’s of articles on a wide variety of subjects including health, economics, government corruption, and civil liberties. He has created an incredibly useful directory that should be read and shared by those who value the truth: You Want A Real List? Directory Of Accurate Alt Media Sources On Syria. Turbeville wrote “...with disturbed “researchers” and various shadowy organizations creating silly lists of “Assadists” “Fake News,” and “Russian propaganda,” I thought it might be useful to create a list of my own, containing a number of the same names, in order to provide a list of researchers, journalists, and activists who have been working to expose the true agenda behind what is happening in Syria today in hopes that my readers will also find their work and find access to additional sources of information which certainly will not be available in the mainstream press. This, of course, is in addition to my own work.”

To conclude on a positive note, the reality on the ground shows that the foreign-backed militants have failed miserably in their pursuit of unseating President Assad and completely leveling the jasmine-scented country.

The will of the Syrian people has proven to be stronger than bombs and propaganda. In a last-ditch effort to shift the outcome of this war, misguided mouthpieces and paid propagandists alike will make a lot of noise, but that’s really all it is.

Their futile attempts at prolonging the war by demonizing people they disagree with is nothing more than a distraction. Ultimately their actions cannot and will not disturb the unrivaled unity of the majority of the Syrian people.",conspiracy,C001bf,big.foot
900,"Big news in the diabetes device world as it relates to future closed loop tech!

Word came on May 28 that the small but mighty startup Bigfoot Biomedical has bought up the key assets of Asante Solutions, the California company that made the click-together and partially-disposable Snap insulin pump but announced just two weeks ago that it was closing up shop for good after being unable to secure sufficient funding.

The news of Asante's demise rocked the Diabetes Community, catching pretty much everyone off-guard -- from current and potential pump customers, to healthcare providers and even most of Asante's own employees and sales reps.

Now, Bigfoot Biomedical, the exciting New York startup rumored to be creating one of the most ingenious closed loop systems for blood sugar control, is swooping in to buy the defunct pump maker's assets -- including the intellectual property behind the Snap pump and the manufacturing infrastructure. No, this doesn't mean Bigfoot will continue to make or sell the Snap pump, or even that Bigfoot will be involved in servicing any existing pumps out there. What it means is that the designs that make the Snap so innovative and unique -- like quick refills, missed bolus reminders, and disposable parts -- will not be lost, but rather live on in future closed loop technology!

Hey, when one door closes, another one opens, right?

If you remember, Bigfoot was first formed late last year (originally as SmartLoop), a result of the growing do-it-yourself mentality among the diabetes tech community, an initiative known as the #WeAreNotWaiting movement.

Bigfoot's new on the scene, but the people behind it are anything but newbies. The main trio of talent are all D-Dads --- Jeffrey Brewer, who became CEO of this startup after leading the JDRF as its CEO for four years up until mid-2014; Lane Desborough, former chief engineer of insulin delivery at Medtronic Diabetes; and Bryan Mazlish, a former exec who earned the nickname ""Bigfoot"" by developing a homemade artificial pancreas system for his T1 wife and young son that was shrouded in mystery for over a year -- prompting a Wired magazine article to refer to its elusive creator as ""Bigfoot.""

See this link to peruse the rest of the talent they've brought on board so far, gathering hardware and algorithm skills from all corners of the healthcare, medical device and digital tech world -- such as Medtronic Diabetes hardware and algorithm creators to the former CFO of Welldoc. It seems this ambitious outfit is adding new faces at breakneck speed!

Since the Bigfoot execs came out of the shadows earlier this year, they've been raising money to get off the ground; less than a month ago reports stated that Bigfoot had brought in $3.5 million from investors so far, with hopes to raise $10-15 million by this summer.

If all goes well, Bigfoot leaders hope to get started on pivotal clinical studies of their prototype system in 2016 and start bringing us the first generation of their device in the few years following that!

We're very proud to announce that Jeffrey Brewer (at right, with his son) will be giving a debut presentation of Bigfoot's work at our DiabetesMine D-Data Exchange event happening this Friday in conjunction with the first day of the ADA Scientific Sessions. We'll share details post-event, but in the meantime we were thrilled to connect with Jeffrey in advance for a quick Q&A about all the very cool happenings with Bigfoot. Here's what he tells us:

DM) Congrats on the exciting news about picking Asante's technology! We're bummed to see them fail of course, but glad something positive could come out of it. So what exactly did you get from them, and what will the impact be?



JB) Bigfoot Biomedical acquired all the assets of Asante Solutions. We are also hiring some former employees to support our plans. We regret that we are not in a position to support the existing Snap users at this time. However, we are thrilled that our efforts to deliver an overall automated insulin delivery system will be greatly accelerated.

Does that leave anything remaining for others to acquire?

No. Per the transaction, Bigfoot acquired all the assets of Asante Solutions.

Can you describe what the plans are at this point for using Asante Snap technology in what Bigfoot is developing?

Asante created the Snap as a simple-to-use insulin pump. We will be leveraging that as a component of our broader automated insulin delivery system. The pump body is likely to stay the same and be mated with a custom controller that will interface with other components of our system.

What does your current prototype look like now, and what can we expect to see once this is available?

I wouldn't say it's clunky, but some have used that language to describe the prototype. Those who've used it quite like it. The difference between our integrated solution and the prototype is that the prototype uses proprietary fobs and cradles to BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) enable an off-the-shelf insulin pump and sensor. Our insulin pump will be sleeker, easier to use and talk to the other components of the system via BLE.

How will the addition of Asante tech impact your development timing and getting into regulatory review?

Having the Asante Snap platform will significantly accelerate and de-risk our pump development efforts. Our plans are to be in pivotal clinical trials in 2016.

Of course many other outfits are also working on closed loop projects. What are the challenges in moving all of these different choices forward?



I believe the only disclosed commercial closed loop development effort is by Medtronic. All the others of which I'm aware are still in the stage of ""proof of concept,"" i.e. academic research, and are being funded by non-profit grants from the NIH, JDRF, Helmsley or individual donors.

One of the challenges is that there is a lot of misunderstanding about the difference between a commercial effort and an academic demonstration project. It will take tens of millions of dollars for us to bring our system to market. Showing something works in a small number of people is important. However, it's still just a science project until there is a funded entity that can build out the range of operational competencies required to develop, test, market and support a commercial closed loop system.

So it's pretty much a race to get the first closed loop system completed and to market?

We don't think being first is what's important. Getting it right, so that we can bring closed loop to the most people at the lowest cost is our focus.

Access to this technology and cost are huge factors... Given all of Bigfoot's collective expertise, is there any sense of how the cost of your system will compare to pumps and CGMs on the market now?

While today’s complex prototypes for “artificial pancreas” systems may strike some as a rich person’s luxury, we intend to deliver an integrated solution that costs less than the sum of all the bits of technology that people are using today. Based on our experience, we believe our system will be more cost-effective than anything else on the horizon. Plus we will lower costs while also delivering better outcomes.

By working on separate projects, aren't we just creating more closed loop ""silos"" that don't connect, instead of open-source platforms that can share data -- which the Diabetes Community has been pushing on for years?

At Bigfoot we are advocates for bringing down the silos and making data available to people with T1D. However, in order to take that data and make decisions for people with T1D (such as with an automated insulin delivery system) there need to be companies that will fund development of a system and take it through clinical trials and regulatory submissions. I wish more companies were making that commitment. I think competition is healthy and that people with T1D should have choices. We plan to be one of the choices.

What about truly open-source initiatives in closed loop tech, like what Dana Lewis and Scott Leibrand are working toward with the OpenAPS initiative?

I'm not sure what happens with OpenAPS. However, I applaud those who are pushing it forward. Their efforts and advocacy are helping to educate everyone (FDA, industry, non-profits) on how desperately these technologies are needed.

Thanks for taking the time, Jeffrey -- definitely some outstanding progress being made, and we can't wait to see what materializes from Bigfoot.

581,"Foot Locker got roughed up last week.

The footwear retailer tumbled 17% on Friday in its worst one-day decline in nearly two years.

Charts suggest it could see some short-lived relief, says Piper Jaffray chief market technician Craig Johnson.

""I look at this chart and it's something that doesn't fit for me from a technical perspective because we have had a big downdraft here in the stock and we're now really oversold. Look for some sort of little relief rally in the stock perhaps back to $53,"" Johnson said Friday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""

The stock was up slightly in Tuesday's premarket, trading at $44.45 a share, so a move back up to $53 marks a 19% rally. However, once any upward momentum is exhausted, it could fall back to new lows, says Johnson.

""I think ultimately we're going to find good footing in this stock coming in around $40, and if that level fails the next big support level comes in at $30. So not a stock for me at this point in time.""

Foot Locker briefly touched $30 in mid-2017, though it has not traded firmly below that level since 2012. It implies 33% downside.

Steve Chiavarone, portfolio manager at Federated Investors, also sees more pain ahead as the U.S.-China trade war tightens its grip on Foot Locker and its peers.

""Nothing is really more at risk from tariffs than specialty and athletic apparel, particularly footwear. That third tranche of threatened tariffs, that additional $300 billion, if that goes into effect, that can increase the price of a sneaker by 40%,"" Chiavarone said on ""Trading Nation"" on Friday.

Foot Locker, Nike, Under Armour and Adidas, among others, united to urge the White House to reconsider threatened tariffs on an additional $300 billion in Chinese goods. The Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America warned that tariffs could cost customers more than $7 billion a year.

977,"he legend of the enormous creature variously known as a yeti, Bigfoot or Sasquatch has long been a source of mystery. But now a study of supposed Bigfoot hair samples has revealed that they actually derive from known mammals including bears, cows, dogs or horses.

A team of scientists led by Bryan Sykes, a human genetics professor at the University of Oxford, analyzed DNA from 30 samples of Bigfoot hair donated by museums and enthusiasts. Although this may come as a blow to cryptozoologists — those who search for creatures whose existence is unproven — the analysis may herald the discovery of a new species of bear.

Two hairs from India and Bhutan show an unknown species that could be a distant cousin of the polar bear or a hybrid of local species and a brown bear. “If these bears are widely distributed in the Himalayas, they may well contribute to the biological foundation of the yeti legend,” the authors said in the study published in the journal .

Although the search for the illusive Bigfoot will likely continue, scientists hope believers will at least step up their game. “The techniques described here put an end to decades of ambiguity about species identification of anomalous primate samples and set a rigorous standard against which to judge any future claims,” researchers said in the study. DNA analysis even revealed that a clump of hair found in Texas actually belonged to a hairy human.",mainstream,M10e6b,big.foot
155,"Reaching the moon was a giant leap for mankind—and for the businesses behind the project. The Apollo program’s total cost was about $25.4 billion, about $152 billion in today’s dollars. That money flowed to giants like Boeing (one of the makers of the Saturn V rocket), established brands like Velcro (whose fasteners kept things in place in space) and some unexpected companies like Hammond Organ (a keyboard manufacturer that created mechanical timers and clocks for the Apollo spacecraft).

One of the most remarkable things about the Moon landing was how short a time it took. President Kennedy proposed NASA would land a person on the moon, and a short eight years later, it did. That meant that it accelerated technology development far faster than would have happened otherwise, says Ella Atkins, an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers senior member. “The rapid prototyping and deployment would have been unprecedented without that kind of program.” The experience gained by companies like Honeywell and Motorola helped push industries like avionics and communications decades into the future.

Apollo didn’t just advance technology. It advanced the way business was done. In an article in the February 1968 issue of Forbes, NASA manager George Mueller explained how he restructured the large, complex Apollo program into smaller “packages,” each with its own manager. The organizational setup made it easier to keep the project running smoothly, and based on its experience, Boeing copied that setup when it developed the 747.

Experience with Apollo also led its contractors to develop new kinds of businesses. Black & Decker (now Stanley Black & Decker), for example, took its experience building tools for the Apollo program into some of the battery-powered consumer products that underlies its $14 billion in annual revenue. Plantronics (now Poly) uses the headsets it manufactured for the Apollo mission as the design basis for headsets it makes today for applications ranging from aviation to gaming.

Perhaps Malcolm Forbes said it best, writing in 1968 that “our future breakthroughs in knowledge will come from the exciting disciplines necessary to solve the problems that arise in trying to reach the Moon and beyond.”

Hundreds of companies helped construct the Apollo spacecraft that sent Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins to the Moon. Here are a few highlights of what they did.

344,"What did Josslyn Hay, a senior British colonial official, know 



about WW2 that required the British secret service

to launch a MAJOR operation to kill him?

As an insider, he knew Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler the same occult network that wanted war to destroy

and demoralize humanity, part of a Master Plan to establish the

Antichrist (Satan) as Lord of the Universe.

The ""Ugly Secret"" of World War Two (Revised from Dec. 7, 2007)





Josslyn Victor Hay, 22nd Earl of Erroll, (1901-1941) a senior British colonial (Kenyan) official, knew the real cause of World War Two and had the stature to be heard.

Winston Churchill ordered the Secret Service (Special Operations Executive) to kill him. What ""ugly secret"" would make the British go to so much trouble to murder a prominent British colonial politician?

Significantly the conspirators chose the codename ""Operation Highland Clearance"" for Erroll's murder. The brutal eviction of Scottish tenants from their farms in the early 1800s is a fitting symbol for the dispossession of the human race by the New World Order, which the Second World War did so much to advance. 



 The popular version of the Nairobi, Kenya murder was depicted in the 1987 movie ""White Mischief"" starring Charles Dance as Lord Erroll and Greta Scacchi as Diana Broughton. 



Erroll's body was found in the early morning Jan. 24, 1941 kneeling in the front passenger footwell of his car with a bullet wound behind the ear, murdered execution style. Erroll, 40, a widower, was having an affair with a married woman Diana Broughton and had dropped her at her nearby home after midnight.

Suspicion was cast on Diana's much older husband Sir Henry Broughton, who was tried but acquitted. The movie pins the blame on him and the decadence of the white settlement in general. 



The murder would have remained unsolved but for a retired SOE insider who, informed of a terminal disease, gave the information to a colleague Tony Trafford who composed a 100-page memo. Trafford, since deceased, gave it to an author, coincidentally named Errol Trzebinski who was writing ""The Life and Death of Lord Erroll: The Truth Behind the Happy Valley Murder "" (2000). (Text can be found here.)



At 6 foot 2"" with chiselled Nordic looks, Lord Erroll was a natural leader, heir to an ancient Scottish lineage, organized and intelligent, an excellent speaker with a photographic memory. A member of the Kenyan colonial legislature, he held the post of Military Secretary with important military and intelligence duties. 



 SOE ""Operation Highland Clearance"" involved more than 100 people. In the early stages of the world war, why was it so important for the Churchill government to silence this man? 





THE GREAT RUSE 





Essentially, Hitler was not interested in a world war. His wanted to conquer the USSR in a ""Nordic"" alliance with England. Erroll belonged to the ""Cliveden Set"" a powerful section of the British elite that supported this alliance. 



Churchill's backers, the Masonic Jewish-owned Bank of England set Hitler up as a means to control Stalin, have a world war and destroy Germany once and for all. War enables them to concentrate power and wealth in their own hands and slaughter natural elites who might interfere with world government. 



The bankers used the Cliveden types to fool Hitler into thinking England approved of his plans. Like proud proteges, the Nazis entertained the English and gave them information on their military build-up. Hitler probably saw himself as a British ally or even an agent. The Nazis were set up. This is the real meaning of the ""Policy of Appeasement."" 



The Cliveden Set divided into two groups, those who were aware of the trap, and those who were not. Erroll was one of the latter who sincerely believed Hitler represented a bulwark to Communism. When the war broke out, Erroll did his patriotic duty. But he knew too much. He was aware of how Hitler and Churchill belonged to the same homosexual occult secret society and he may have said this within range of MI-5 assets. Stalin was a member of the same Illuminati and helped fund Hitler's rise. They colluded in Barbarosa. The war was strictly a ruse designed to kill goyim.

Errol's father, Victor Hay, was the British High Commissioner in the Rhineland. At age 20, Errol was the private secretary to the British Ambassador in Berlin. He spoke German and French fluently, knew the Prince of Wales, and was part of the European elite. 



 His diplomatic career hit the rocks in 1924 when he married a twice-divorced woman. Idina Sackville, eight years his senior. He followed her to Kenya where she had a large estate won in a divorce settlement. They had a daughter. 



Erroll visited England, joined Oswald Mosley's Fascist party but later quit. He was a close friend of the Duke of Hamilton who was a linchpin in the Bank of England's ""Hitler Project."" 



In May 1941, three months after Errol's death, Rudolf Hess, Deputy Fuhrer, flew to Scotland to present Hamilton with a generous peace proposal. Both men were homosexuals. Hess was Hitler's homosexual lover in the Landsberg Prison and helped him compose ""Mein Kampf.""

Hitler was created by a homosexual occult secret society spanning both British and Nazi elites. This was called the Thule Society in Germany and the Order of the Golden Dawn in England. Aleister Crowley's Ordo Templi Orientis was the common link. 



Winston Churchill, a Druid, was part of this occult scene. (He was also a friend of Edward VIII, considered a Nazi sympathizer.) But the Nazis branch was not aware of the hidden English agenda. Erroll was silenced because he opposed Communism but knew Hitler was a Judas goat empowered to lead Germany to destruction. He could give away the hidden agenda. 





 (See Churchill's homosexual connection. ) 





THE MURDER 





 On Sept 7, 1940, a highly placed group including Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, the Fourteenth Duke of Hamilton, met in Scotland and decided to terminate Josslyn Hay, Lord Erroll. The matter was to be handled by SOE Cairo station. 



 Jock and Diana Broughton left were MI-5 assets who entered Kenya in Nov. 1940 to discover Erroll's intentions and to involve him in a love triangle that would obscure the real purpose of his murder. In December, another agent-couple entered Kenya and on the night of the murder, pretended to have engine trouble. They requested a ride back to town for the female who shot Errol. There were radio-controlled teams following Erroll.

Jock Broughton was tried but found innocent. He ""committed suicide"" shortly after returning to England. Diana who died in 1987, went on to marry one of the richest men in Kenya.

Trezebinski's retired SOE contacts try to put a slightly different spin on events suggesting Erroll was murdered because ""ex-appeasers "" in the establishment including ""the Duke of Hamilton, senior figures in Chamberlain's last cabinet, close friends of Edward VIII and Edward himself"" would be embarrassed by what Erroll knew. (p.280) 



One insider told her Rudolf Hess, Lord Moyne, and Erroll shared knowledge of some ""ugly secret."" Jewish terrorists ostensibly murdered Lord Moyne in 1944 for this reason.

Other Cliveden members who died mysterious and premature deaths were Lord Lothian (1940), Lord Rothermere (1940), Sir Harry Oakes (1943) and the former Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain who died of ""cancer"" in Nov. 1940 six months after leaving office. Hamilton conveniently died in action in 1944. The two SOE agents also conveniently died in action. 



 (left, Hitler and Petain in Masonic thumb on knuckle handshake)

According to this insider, the ""ugly secret"" is ""not that Churchill had discovered the conspiracy ... but that he had been part of it.""

Lord Erroll was in a position to know Churchill, Hitler, Stalin and FDR were all part of the same kabbalistic secret society (Freemasonry, Illuminati) at the heart of Communism. Lord Erroll opposed Communism but knew Hitler was a decoy. This is why he had to be silenced.



CONCLUSION 





The ultimate ""ugly secret"" is that the USSR was a creation of British Freemasonry, financed by the Bank of England. They may have lost control of Stalin and created Hitler to menace him. But the British would never abandon Stalin. Russian Communism was one half of their NWO Hegelian dialectic. We see it today in the form of arbitrary state power, repression, censorship and indoctrination. Nazism was also a dry-run for the New World Order but it was their Plan ""B""



 As Erroll's fate makes clear, intelligence agencies work for the Masonic central bankers, not for the countries they pretend to serve. They are used to eliminate any genuine threat to the banker's credit monopoly and world dictatorship agenda.

The real point is that history is a hoax, contrived by cabalist central bankers, to advance world tyranny. They empower Satanists, perverts, and misfits to create war and mayhem. For example, chaos relieved Winston Churchill's chronic depression. He confessed at the onset of WWI: ""Everything is tending to catastrophe and collapse. I am interested, geared up, and happy. Is it not horrible to be built like this?""

These perverts and monsters are our leaders. Subverted by a Luciferian Jewish cult, Cabalism, the moral bankruptcy of Western society is masked by material prosperity but this cannot last. Thus, they are erecting a police state while the intelligentsia and masses can still be bought with their own credit.

1329,"Something very sinister and creepy is happening in the deep, dark forests of the United States National Park System (NPS). Large numbers of people have gone missing with no trace – only to be found dead, sometimes weeks later, far from their last known location, often at a higher elevation, and sometimes, in inaccessible places.

Retired police officer David Paulides broke the story on these strange disappearances from many US national parks. He details some extremely bizarre events that are not being covered by mainstream media.

The cases of missing persons in or near the boundary of the NPA are so numerous that the author first published a book titled “Missing 411.” As Paulides continued investigating accounts of people gone missing in North America, he then released “Missing 411 — Eastern United States: Unexplained Disappearances of North Americans That Have Never Been Solved,” followed by “Missing 411” books for the “Western US and Canada,” “North American and Beyond,” “The Devil’s in the Details,” “Hunters,” and “A Sobering Coincidence.”

With all this material on such an intriguing subject, small wonder that they made a movie with the same name: “Missing 411.”

Paulides, earned graduate and post-graduate degrees at the University of San Francisco. A proud father who values family bonds, his first career featured 20 years experience in California law enforcement. After retiring from the San Jose Police Department, Paulides then accepted “a job offer in technology making much more money” where he used his forensic skills to conduct due diligence for partnership development and acquisitions.

In 2009, while doing research for a funded, scientific study to prove or disprove the existence of Bigfoot, two off-duty national park rangers contacted Paulides in the middle of the night with information they felt was important he hear. Each ranger had worked at several parks in the span of their park service careers, and both had been part of many search and rescue missions for lost visitors.

The rangers were concerned because “they believed there was an inordinate amount of missing people and the park service was not conducting follow-up investigations, wasn’t tracking missing people and didn’t appear to understand the issues behind the disappearances.”

After an initial missing-person report flurry report would die down in the local media, the park service performed no further inquiries, letting these cases die and grow cold. This is odd, in and of itself, since a contingent of federally-trained park service law enforcement special agents are tasked to investigate crimes committed in the parks. They patrol, and are in charge of, 189 locations.

However, the rangers who confided in Paulides knew that the people they had tried to find had not fallen into creeks or off cliffs – they had vanished with no trace. The rangers asked Paulides to take a deep dive into this puzzling matter, which he did the following morning.

Paulides called some of his law enforcement sources. He asked them to see if there had actually been numerous disappearances at the locations indicated by the rangers, and to see if the numbers of people reported missing added up. The quick reply confirmed unquestionably that “a ton” of people had indeed disappeared from those very locations.

Paulides then “filed dozens of freedom of information act (FOIA) requests against the National park Service and other institutions.” The most famous of these asked the NPS “for statistics and documentation of missing people inside their system” on Yosemite National Park – the first one he filed after returning home after the two rangers tipped him off.

Paulides asked the NPS to provide lists of missing people for Yosemite and the entire park system, expecting a quick and positive response. Police departments post such lists on their websites and typically want to share this type of information in order to locate those missing.

About two months later, an attorney representing the federal land management organization wrote a letter – which is, in itself, an unusual response to this type of request – to inform Paulides that the NPS didn’t keep track of missing people in their parks, could not produce lists of names of missing people, nor dates or any numbers of how many people are still unaccounted for.

The shocker is that the NPS claimed it kept no such data for any of the 183 national parks in the system! This defies a federal mandate that any child that disappears in North American has to be put on the missing child database that is monitored and legislated by the government.

The NPS attorney told Paulides a list would have to be made up “by scratch” and the price tag would be $1.4 million for the park entire system and $34,000 for a list just for Yosemite.

Paulides’ law enforcement contacts all said there must be a reason the NPS wanted to suppress and withhold this information. His conclusion is that the NPS is faced with an unknown lethal threat, and doesn’t want to panic the public and hurt their tourist trade.

Thus began The CanAm Missing Project, “the first website dedicated to understanding the complexity and issues of searching, rescuing and investigating people missing in the wilds of North America.”

The CanAm Missing Project has identified 34 clusters of missing people in North America. The biggest concentration is in Yosemite. HowStuffWorks estimates that “more than 1,000 visitors have disappeared while visiting a park, often without a trace.”

582,"We are dealing with Star Wars. It involves the combination of chemtrails for creating an atmosphere that will support electromagnetic waves, ground-based, electromagnetic field oscillators called gyrotrons, and ionospheric heaters. Particulates make directed energy weapons work better. It has to do with “steady state” and particle density for plasma beam propagation. They spray barium powders and let it photo-ionize from the ultraviolet light of the sun. Then, they make an aluminum-plasma generated by “zapping” the metal cations that are in the spray with either electromagnetics from HAARP, the gyrotron system on the ground [Ground Wave Emergency Network], or space-based lasers. The barium makes the aluminum-plasma more particulate dense. This means they can make a denser plasma than they normally could from just ionizing the atmosphere or the air. More density [more particles] means that these particles which are colliding into each other will become more charged because there are more of them present to collide. What are they ultimately trying to do up there — is create charged-particle, plasma beam weapons. Chemtrails are the medium – GWEN pulse radars, the various HAARPs, and space-based lasers are the method, or more simply: Chemtrails are the medium — directed energy is the method. This system appears to be in Russia, Canada, the United States, and all of Europe. Exotic weapons can be mobile, stationary, land-based, aerial, or satellite. It is an offensive and defensive system against EM attacks and missiles. It uses ionospheric particle shells as defense mechanisms [like a bug-zapper shell]* against missiles and EM attacks. That means they spray and then pump up the spray with electromagnetics. When these shells are created using the oscillating, electromagnetic, gyrotron stations, it “excludes” and displaces the background magnetic field. These shells can be layered one above another in a canopy fashion for extra protection from missiles. The chemtrail sprays have various elements in them like carbon which can used to absorb microwaves. Some of these sprays have metal flakes in them that make aerial craft invisible to radar. Spoofer sprays. Sprays like these can be used to create colorful, magnetized plasmas to cloak fighter jets. There are satellite weapons involved. Activists are using meters and are getting readings of microwaves, x-rays, and some other kind of emission that they are not sure of, maybe a low-intensity laser. They are also photographing gas plasma generation due to the heating of chemtrails by electromagnetics. The technical names for vertical and horizontal plasma columns are columnar focal lenses and horizontal drift plasma antennas. Various size of gas plasma orbs are associated with this technology. These orbs can be used as transmitters and receivers because they have great, refractory and optical properties. They also are capable of transmitting digital or analog sound. Barium, in fact, is very refractive — more refractive than glass. What does that mean? Someone or someones are very involved in unconstitutional, domestic spying and the entrained plasma orbs carried on electromagnetic beams can be used for mind control programming. The satellites can be programmed to track and monitor various frequencies on different parts of your body. These electromagnetic beams carrying the gas plasma orbs stick due magnetic polarity and frequency mapping and tracking to people’s eyes, ears, temples, and private parts. A beam with entrained orbs carries pictures in each orb just like the different frames in a movie. It is a particle beam that is also a frequency weapon. The satellites download holographic mind control movies, pictures, sounds, and sensations to people through this technology. The Air Force has stated in “Air Force 2025” that their goal is to develop virtual and augmented reality mind control. Depending on the how the computer is programmed or depending on the mood or intent of the person interfacing with the technology, you can be probed, bothered, gaslighted, frightened, manipulated, electronically raped, or tortured. It scans your brain frequencies and deciphers your thoughts. The satellites track you by mapping your bioenergetic signature [body biometrics] and constantly scanning an area to find you. We are the lab rats for this technology and something is very wrong in the military or intelligence branches somewhere. Because developmental projects in government and military are often so compartmentalized, I suppose someone could be using and developing this technology secretly and without authorization. Then again, behavioral and mind control programs were an authorized policy under MKULTRA. Our country has a history of experimenting on its citizens. We are talking about satellite charged-particle frequency weapons attacking a person 24 hours a day. Psychotronic weapons are considered weapons of mass destruction by the U.N. “HAARPs” can create earthquakes and can also x-ray the earth to find underground military bases, gold, or oil reserves. These ionospheric heaters can also operate as an over-the-horizon or under-the-ocean communications system. This system can control the weather or create disasters. Taken together with the aurora keyhole through-your-roof satellite surveillance system, Echelon electronic computer/phone sweeps, plasma-cloaked DOD Drug War helicopters and stealths, implants, and cameras on the street, it constitutes one, big global and space control grid. These weapons involve beams. Two beams overlapped will couple into a particle-ion beam that will bounce off of a remote target and send a holographic image back to the satellite for remote spying operations. When you cross two strong beams, you can supposedly* create scalar energies. These energies can be used as untraceable weapons for nuclear size explosions or for defense. These crossed-energies can be used to cause a person’s physical electrical system to fail or with a lower frequency, administer a kind of remote electro-shock. Visualize touching a positive and negative electric cable to each other on top of your head. Scalar energies can be utilized in hand-held military guns and on tanks. They can dud-out electronics or cause large, electrical blackouts. Scalar energies are practically impossible to shield against. You need lead, ceramics, and a deep underground facility to not be affected by these weapons. Or, you need to be up and above the field of battle. People who are working on these issues hear tones and hums. If you hear persistent tones and static; have body vibrations, burning sensations, “bangs” to the head, neurological damage, or immune system damage; are hearing electronic voices or hearing the sound of a plasma; suffering from pains deep in your organs or constant headaches; or experiencing other anomalous activity then you may be being targeted by directed energy, mind control weapons. These weapons could be on helicopters, jets, stealth fighters, or on satellites. Directed energy beams and electromagnetic waves can be sent to you via hand-held devices or piggy-backed in on cell phone and satellite towers. Is it possible that someone(s) are very afraid of coming famines and riots due to the ongoing, man-induced failure of the ecological system, and they are saturating the earth with chemtrails for large- scale, gas plasma mind control? Is this the last grasp for the world’s resources? Or, are they just control freaks and money mongers? Someone would like to get to that oil under the melting [due to chemtrail-trapped EM heat] Artic. And, I guess the Third World is not a part of this system. I don’t think that the developed nations are going to let them in on this either. Any country that joins this NATO system will become mind-controlled and diseased due to the associated, intense, oscillating, electromagnetic fields, electromagnetic soup, and the poisonous, toxic chemtrails. Our DNA will break. We risk the earth’s spin and tilt becoming messed up due to mucking around with the magnetic fields through this military technology. Maybe, it is already messed up. It constitutes U.S. global domination via NATO and the erosion of civil rights. According to Charlotte Iserbyt and Al Martin, there are ex-KGB and ex-STASI advising our new Office of Total Information Awareness. They are the ones creating our new internal passports [national ID]. And under “The Treaty on Open Skies,” we have overflights by Russian and German military. Who exactly is flying those plasma-cloaked craft that are seen all over this country and mistaken for UFOs by people who do not know about this aerial deception technology? Obviously, we have another “Project Paperclip” in the making. We can add the new thugs to the 2,000 Iraqi brought into country by Daddy Bush who are now living in Nebraska. The elitist corporate government is going to hold the rest of us hostage with directed energy weapons in space, if the Policy for a New American Century group – PNAC – Bush and cronie think tank has their way, along with directed energy attacks against any country or citizen that they decide they do not like. These weapons can create climate war, weather war, mind war, cyber war, disease war, disaster war, and undetectable war. Taken together they can create economic war. If this system is not stopped, it will kill billions due to aluminum and barium poisoning. It will kill billions due to crop failures and world-wide famine. It will cause heart attacks, strokes, and cancers. It will cause stillbirths, miscarriages, and infertility. The chemtrail sprays often have fungi, bacteria, viruses, dessicated red blood cells, crystalline substances, carbon, metal cations, lithium, other chemicals, heavy metals, and God knows what – probably smart dust, or nanocrap. Years of biowarfare testing on the American public is no big secret anymore. Spraying germs in the sky where they mutate due to the ultra-violet light — brillant plan, my man. Are we acceptable losses or is this by design? I know that many of the major players have big investments in pharmaceutical companies, GM seeds [seeds that can grow in an electromagnetic soup], weapons and directed energy development contracts, oil contracts, genetic research, and mind control research. Some of these people have had a familial history of financial and policy support for population control, eugenics, Hitler, Mao, Stalin, Lenin, Marx, Pinochet, Hussein, and various other dictators. Some of the major players were the masterminds of the death squads in Central and South America. They stand to make a big profit on our death and disease. Just take a look at Rumsfield and Tamiflu. I assume that they know the dangers of this system and that they take care to stay in their shielded, air-filtered offices, homes, bases, and cars. I assume they take chelating substances to remove the barium and aluminum from their bodies and minds. If not, then they really do not understand the far-ranging implications of this destructive system. Congress may not understand just what a terrible weapons system and control grid they are funding. As I understand it, Tesla towers attached to deep-earth, free-energy taps are to be created over the 10-12 magnetic poles and the GWEN system phased-out. Has this already been done? This should allow total control of the earth through giant, Tesla death ray-guns. This natural, electromagnetic earth was not meant to be an un-natural dynamo to power man’s weapons or his utility companies. Over-unity systems [Tesla devices]* are as of yet, another unexplored and probably not understood man-made energy. We should be very suspect of free energy. As we can see, the forms of man-made energy that have been created and used in the past have not been good for this planet. Maybe it is time to reconsider the options available to us through the development of crops for fuel, wind, solar, and water power. We need world-wide, different, more holistic, renewable, energy programs. Is there any good news? Yes. There has been tons of particulate dumping through the spray operations for 8 years over the Americas, Europe, Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, and from what I can find out, over Russia. And, what goes around blows around, right? So, these substances are probably actually global. It sure makes a ton of sense to spray poisonous elements in 24 NATO countries and let the substances be carried around the earth on the jet streams to poison yourself, your enemies, and all neutral and non-combatent countries. Talk about making more enemies. The water, air, and soil of all of these countries is so saturated with metal cations that these weapons freaks should be able to zap and mind f–k each other quite well now and as often as they wish. Once they have clobbered each other with light-saber beams for a few years and razed and scorched sections of the earth, they may start to realize that this foreign policy will lead to a defective human race and a rotten economy. Do you think they will have knocked some sense into each other by then and will decide that non-proliferation and arms reduction is the more civilized and mature direction to take in world affairs? I doubt it, cause only idiots would have developed horrific, planet-killer weapons like these.

1134,"This week, a massive power weight lifter by the name of Sajad Gharibi, announced that he will soon be making his debut in a mixed martial arts fight against a Brazilian opponent who has yet to be named. Aside from the fact that he will be making his debut, no other details about the match have been announced. However, there is still a ton of excitement about the match just because of Gharibi’s size and appearance.

Gharibi is also known as the ‘Iranian Hulk,’ for his massive size and appearance. Photos of the large weight lifter look almost like a cartoon or someone in a body suit, because his muscles are so large but his waist and legs are small when compared to the rest of his body.

“I’m finally accepting my first professional fight from a Brazilian fighter before 2020. I’m ready for the challenge,” Gharibi wrote on Instagram.

The Iranian Hulk stands at 6 foot 2 inches, and weighs 385 pounds, but he really does look like the hulk!

The world has been awaiting his first fight since his initial debut was canceled. Gharibi was initially scheduled to fight the ‘scariest man on the planet’ Martyn Ford, but for some reason, the match never happened.

Gharibi doesn’t have any experience with martial arts or professional fighting, but people are curious to see how he will do against seasoned MMA fighters.

Other former power weight lifters have entered the world of mixed martial arts, including former five time World’s Strongest Man Mariusz Pudzianowski, who transitioned to MMA in 2009 and has done well for himself in the sport.

Gharibi has an incredible following on social media, and his Instagram page has been growing larger since this week’s announcement.

Gharibi has also said that he would be interested in joining the Iranian Armed Forces to help in the continued fight against ISIS.

“I will always be a soldier for my country. I hope to start up my training again and reach my goal, in two or three years, to be in good enough shape to be of service to my country,” he said in 2016.

UFC star Brian Ortega says he would smash “Iranian Hulk” if he is the one who ends up fighting him.

“I would just gas him out, p*** him off. Of course, you’re gonna see me just get mauled up like a damn little chihuahua in the beginning. But just when I ride that wave out, it’s a done deal man. He’ll gas out and he’ll be mine,” Ortega told TMZ Sports after the announcement this week.

However, there has been no indication that Ortega is his opponent, and it is entirely possible that Ortega is just jumping on a chance to get his name in the news.

It is possible that Gharibi is hoping for a big payday from getting involved in the MMA, since there is so much money in the growing industry.

Gharibi recently made a post on Instagram asking for a sponsor. The post read, “I am an Iranian citizen with traditional values of Persian upbringing surrounded with a close-knit family and also many great friends from all around the world who have supported me every step of the way in these difficult times. As a sportsman throughout my career all the cost and expenses and fees have been covered and paid from my own budget without to received any support or help from Iranian authorities or sport organisations and unfortunately there are plenty of others talented young people in Iran who suffers exactly in similar way to my situation despite I’m trying my best to find a sponsor.”

It has even been rumored that Gharibi could join the WWE at some point in the future, and he has even given hints about the potential partnership on social media.

“There has been a lot of talk and rumors about wwe and in particular my participation to join the company but all I have to say is at this time if there will be any collaboration between myself and ‘Triple H’ then I’ll let you guys knows about it afterwards and hopefully I’ll decide and make my final decision by the end of autumn!” Gharibi said.",conspiracy,C03829,big.foot
904,"At the White House and in a series of conference calls Monday, Democrats wrestled with the one question that preoccupies the party after Donald Trump’s stunning victory: What to do about the Obama coalition?

Neither President Barack Obama nor Hillary Clinton explicitly framed it that way in their private and public conversations with party members Monday. But the looming question colored their remarks to shell-shocked operatives and activists, and it serves as the backdrop for the brewing battle over the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee — a fight that some Democrats are terrified will devolve into a three-month factional war over the party’s identity, rather than a difference of opinion over party tactics.

Speaking in terms of a Democratic Party at a crossroads during his news conference Monday, Obama said he would try not to “big-foot” the party’s conversation about the future. Later, in a conference call with Democratic activists, he didn’t address any second-guessing of his or Clinton’s strategy and again stopped short of dictating the path forward. The recently defeated Clinton took much the same approach in her own private discussion with House Democrats on Monday, speaking vaguely of the road ahead but stopping short of offering specific directions.

“Two things we can’t afford to be is discouraged or divided,” she said, according to a Democrat on the call. “We can’t be distracted or diverted in the fights ahead.”

Yet the issue of whether to re-engage the young voters and minorities who elected Obama to two terms but didn’t turn out for Clinton, or reach out to the disaffected white working-class voters who swung to Trump, is too pressing to be avoided.



In the wake of Clinton’s shocking defeat, there is widespread skepticism among Democrats about whether the voters who elected Obama will be enough to carry the White House for any future Democrat after an election in which Clinton lost by wide margins among white voters and in rural areas where Trump proved devastatingly popular.

“ We’ve started to lose touch with white voters. They’re still the majority out there, and we can’t claim to be a big-tent party if we lose touch with working-class voters, whether they’re black, white, blue or red,” said DNC member Boyd Brown of South Carolina. “When you have Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer making the sale for you, that dog don’t hunt. It’s time to reshuffle the deck and get some younger folks in there with some more diverse backgrounds. It’s time for a leadership shakeup.”

After party members are done surveying Democrats’ hollowed-out down-ballot landscape, and with the national party on the precipice of an all-out brawl for the central committee’s chairmanship, everything is suddenly on the table as Democrats try to determine whether the party chose the wrong messenger, the wrong message or the wrong audience.

Some are convinced that a tighter focus on a simple economic message would be an important start.

“Everything is so fresh; it’s been less than a week to analyze what we have here. I just know [zeroing in on jobs] is what the people of my state expect from me,” said Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo, a Democrat serving in her first term. “When I’m out and about talking to people, asking, ‘What’s on your mind, what are you concerned about, what can we do to make your life better?’ That’s the No. 1, No. 2, No. 3 thing. A good job with some security, and the confidence that my kids will be able to get a great job.”

Other top Democrats have zeroed in on the party’s narrow-casting approach to voters and an overreliance on modeled targeting of potential supporters.

“In this election, every key element of the Democratic coalition underperformed, and we need to do better,” said former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, who is considering a run for DNC chairman after he fell short in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. “The strategy of narrowly defining the base and then microtargeting it and texting it until it doesn’t turn out isn’t a winning strategy for the future.”

“We have to stop trying to microtarget very different messages for every demographic, and recognize that voters can disagree with you on specific issues as long as they genuinely believe that you want to do the best for every American,” added Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander, who narrowly lost his race for the U.S. Senate last week. “It’s not about any specific type of voter or demographic. It’s about making sure we are being unapologetic and honest about what we believe. Voters are smart, and they know the difference. They know when you’re saying one thing to one group and another thing to another group.”

Already, such divisions are on display in the race for the DNC chairmanship — a proxy for the fight over the party’s general direction — with each candidate prescribing a different potential antidote to the party’s ills.

Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean — an ex-party chairman and presidential candidate — and South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison are formally running. Others — including O’Malley and New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley, a DNC vice chairman — are still considering bids of their own. Labor Secretary Tom Perez is interested, said a Democrat familiar with his thinking, and Kander told Politico he’s open to it, though he’s not actively pursuing the role at the moment.

Ellison, the likely favorite due to his early support from a group of prominent Democrats and others including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, has spent part of this week speaking to attendees at a conference sponsored by the Democracy Alliance. The meeting includes major liberal donors plotting the path ahead. And the Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chairman’s formal announcement on Monday listed backing from establishment-leaning Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Chris Murphy, reflecting party leaders’ wishes to avoid a messy fight.

But Ellison’s road to the chairmanship isn’t quite the glide path it seems. Some DNC members, like Brown, say they might be uncomfortable empowering someone who is so avowedly on the left side of the party spectrum and fear the potential message to voters of Ellison’s elevation — the election of a progressive African-American, Muslim-American from a blue state, might be viewed as a direct, confrontational response to Trump’s win.

“A knee-jerk reaction would be problematic: putting someone in a position of power just because he’s everything Donald Trump is against [would be the result of] misreading the electorate,” Brown said. “We saw the vote tallies we just had, they weren’t good. Putting Keith Ellison in charge would put voters across the spectrum the wrong way.”

The DNC’s electoral math is still up in the air: Ellison’s initial release announcing his candidacy included endorsements from multiple state party chairs, muddling the state-level Democrats’ informal agreement last week to vote as a bloc once the time comes. Two from their own ranks, after all, are still in the running.

Harrison, who announced his own candidacy Monday night, said the party needs to reconfigure how it connects with voters to appeal to a wider swath.

“If we talk about issues that are really important to people, we can appeal to rural working-class people,” he told Politico, mentioning the problem of securing credit as an example of an issue that resonates but has been out of the political discussion. “Figuring it out connects people, whether you’re a white person in rural West Virginia or a black person in New York or a Latino in New Mexico. Barriers to success. That’s what we have to be talking about.”

Explaining that his focus is on bolstering the party’s infrastructure at the local level — a message similarly pushed by Obama on Monday — Buckley said, “We can reach out to both the young African-American voters and the working-class whites as well. There’s nothing wrong with our message if articulated by someone they can trust: a neighbor or a local chair.”

O’Malley, a former Democratic Governors Association chairman, also pointed to the necessity of rebuilding the party down-ballot while formulating a believable economic message. “We need a 50-state strategy that’s mindful: We need to win back governors’ offices, we need to win back state legislatures. We lost a lot of seats in the last few years,” he said. “We need to start acting like a party again, and the leading edge of that needs to be an economic message that’s credibly delivered.”

“Others will parse and do the postmortem on this election,” he added. “But what became clear is that people did not hear, or did not believe, our economic message, notwithstanding 79 months in a row of positive economic job growth.”

Dean, the former party chairman, said much of the task lies in appealing to younger voters — leading him to “tentatively” rebrand his famous 50-state strategy as the “50-50 strategy: the 50-state strategy, the 50-year strategy,” he said, referring to voters younger than 50 who had voted for Democrats before and need to be wrapped up by the party.

Dean’s political considerations then swung to reckoning with the president-elect, a figure whom some party leaders hope will provide divided Democrats with opportunities to unite — against, for example, his new senior counselor Steve Bannon.

“What we need to do is what matters in people’s communities, and after a couple years of Trump, it’s going to be clear he doesn’t care about those communities,” he said. “It’s much more important for us to have a positive message. Republicans got where they got with a negative message, but they also got Trump.”

Even if it’s not as all-consuming as considering the Obama coalition’s future in the post-Obama era, the idea of providing an affirmative message in the age of Trump is ubiquitous among current and aspiring party leaders.

“Given the extreme, vitriolic, pernicious rhetoric of the campaign, the Democrats have an obligation to their constituents to prepare for anything that undermines the progress of America,” said Kevin de León, president pro tem of the California state Senate and a rising star within the party.

“I’ve said this within the context of California, but it’s the same thing for the direction of the Democratic Party: We can’t allow one election to reverse generations of progress.”",mainstream,M13178,big.foot
346,"The one-sided relationship between the Philippines and the United States dates back to 1902 when the last revolutionaries capitulated to the US military after fighting the Spanish 6 years before. The Spanish American War resulted in the transfer of control over this country from the Spaniards into the hands of the Americans.

 

 The Treaty of Paris which governs said transfer involved a payment of $20 million made to Spain not by Americans, as standard history books would tell the public, but was actually paid for by sovereign personalities. Therefore, the Americans should never have any authority over the islands in the first place.

 For 113 years this American colony has been relishing unprecedented economic growth which resulted to the country having one of the most fearsome military forces in the region.

 Behold the symbol of Philippine-United States Friendship!

The Philippine navy is quietly reinforcing the hull and deck of a rusting ship it ran aground on a disputed South China Sea reef in 1999 to stop it breaking apart, determined to hold the shoal as Beijing creates a string of man-made islands nearby.

 Using wooden fishing boats and other small craft, the navy has run the gauntlet of the Chinese coastguard to move cement, steel, cabling and welding equipment to the BRP Sierra Madre since late last year, two navy officers who have been inside the vessel told Reuters in recent interviews.

 Japan, Philippines and the US are sending a signal to Beijing that they will challenge any attempt to dominate the South China Sea by reclaiming land on Spratley Islands

 The 100 metre-long (330-foot) tank landing ship was built for the U.S. Navy during World War Two. It was eventually transferred to the Philippine navy, which deliberately grounded it on Second Thomas Shoal to mark Manila’s claim to the reef in the Spratly archipelago of the South China Sea. A small contingent of Philippine soldiers are stationed onboard.

 Manila regards Second Thomas Shoal, which lies 105 nautical miles (195 km) southwest of the Philippine region of Palawan, as being within its 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone. China, which claims virtually all the South China Sea, says the reef is part of its territory.

 “We know China has been waiting for the ship to disintegrate but we are doing everything to hold it together,” said one of the officers, adding that while the work was progressing slowly, it should be finished by the year-end.

 The other naval officer said welding was being done at night because of the heat. Concrete foundations were being laid inside the ship’s hull to try to stabilise it, he added.

 Without giving exact dates, both sources said they witnessed the repairs taking place earlier this year. They declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to the media.

The soldiers currently stationed on the ship, who are demolition experts, were doing the work, said the second source.

 Just to the west of Second Thomas Shoal is Mischief Reef, one of seven coral formations in the Spratlys that China is rapidly turning into islands that Beijing says will have undefined military purposes.

 Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei also have overlapping claims to the Spratly waterway, which is some 1,100 km (680 miles) from the Chinese mainland.

 Asked about the repairs, Philippine Foreign Ministry spokesman Charles Jose declined to comment. But such work would not violate an informal code of conduct signed in 2002 by China and Southeast Asian states that prohibited any change to the status quo in disputed areas, he said.

 “In our view, repairs and maintenance of existing facilities are allowed … especially if such repairs and maintenance work are for the safety of our personnel and safety of navigation,” Jose added.

 The Philippine Defence Ministry declined to comment.

China’s Defence and Foreign Ministries did not respond to a request for comment.

 A Philippine general familiar with the repairs told Reuters the ship’s hull and deck were being strengthened, and air-conditioning units added.

 “We are improving the living quarters inside, to make life for our soldiers more comfortable,” he said, declining to give further details about the repairs or be identified.

 Pictures taken by a Reuters photographer who sailed to the BRP Sierra Madre with other media in March last year show a pockmarked vessel covered in rust, sitting on the permanently submerged reef but listing slightly to one side. Much of the boat’s hull is visible.

 Besides being a military outpost, the BRP Sierra Madre is also a commissioned Philippine navy ship.

 That means Manila could request U.S. military assistance under a decades-old security treaty with Washington if the ship was attacked, said senior Philippine military officials.

 “Even if it’s covered with rust, it will remain an active duty commissioned navy ship. It’s a symbol of our sovereignty,” said the Philippine general.

 Second Thomas Shoal illustrates the mismatch in power between the Philippines and China.

 Since the start of 2014, the Philippine navy’s regular attempts to re-supply soldiers on the BRP Sierra Madre with food and water have become a cat-and-mouse routine, with large Chinese coastguard vessels on patrol in the area trying to block the path of the smaller Philippine boats, naval officials said.

 The Philippine vessels have always gotten through by making a run for the shoal’s shallow waters, which aren’t deep enough for the Chinese coastguard, naval officials said. The tear-shaped shoal itself is large, some 10-11 nautical miles from top to bottom.

 Zhang Baohui, a mainland security expert at Hong Kong’s Lingnan University, said Beijing would be angry about the repairs, adding that Chinese ships would probably continue their “menacing” tactics. But they would not do anything that could be considered an act of war, Zhang said.

 “The larger geo-strategic context is more important than Second Thomas Shoal,” he said.

585,"We've been socially distancing for weeks now, riding out the coronavirus pandemic from our homes in the suburbs — or our studio apartments in Manhattan. We've turned to remote working and learning, virtual happy hours with friends and family, online shopping and digital fitness apps just to stay sane. Various studies on the internet say it can take anywhere from three weeks to two months to form a new habit. One way or another, many of us will emerge from this crisis with new ways of doing things — especially when it comes to consumption. Retailers, in turn, will need to adapt. And fast. Shoppers will be looking for spaces where they feel safe. A new report from Big Red Rooster, a brand experience firm owned by real estate services company JLL, highlights seven key ways we are changing as consumers because of Covid-19. ""You can't un-live this experience,"" said Emily Miller, VP of Strategy & Insight at Big Red Rooster, who added that while the Great Recession changed our financial habits, the coronavirus crisis will have a far more dramatic effect on a host of behaviors. The new habits formed during this pandemic in 2020 will go ""far beyond just our spending patterns,"" Miller said. Here's the full list, as compiled by Big Red Rooster.

The coronavirus pandemic is changing how we think about touching things. Studies have found the Covid-19 virus can last up to three days on plastic and stainless steel, and up to 24 hours on cardboard. It is still unclear how long it can linger on materials like clothing. As people return to stores, many will be wary of picking up merchandise that has come in contact with others, pushing shopping carts and punching the buttons on credit-card readers. The biggest U.S. mall owner, Simon Property Group, is already encouraging all of its retail tenants to use contactless payment methods, such as Apple Pay, CNBC reported earlier this week. Simon is preparing to reopen 49 of its roughly 200 malls and outlet centers, starting Friday. Macy's, as it sets out to reopen 68 stores come Monday, is going to hold the merchandise that customers try on in fitting rooms for 24 hours before returning it to racks. And it will mandate all customers use hand sanitizer before trying on jewelry or watches.

Similar to avoiding touching things, we are thinking more about protecting our personal bubbles. For weeks on end now, we've been asked to keep at minimum six feet away from our neighbors. And those social distancing guidelines will likely be in place for some time into the foreseeable future. When consumers venture out, tight and cramped spaces will be avoided. Open-air shopping centers will be preferred over enclosed shopping malls. Capacity will be limited in stores to make sure they do not become overcrowded. Electronics retailer Best Buy, for example, is gradually reopening its stores — but only for in-store consultations by appointment.

The pandemic has instilled in many consumers a greater interest in shopping local. People want to support their favorite coffee shops, breweries or dress boutiques — so that they don't go out of business. Many shoppers will still look to shop local, even post Covid-19, according to Miller, who said it has made more people realize how much they appreciate mom-and-pop shops. Sixty-eight percent of people who have recently shopped local tipped more than they normally do, Big Red Rooster found in surveying 528 U.S. consumers, of various age groups, from April 9 to April 14.

In March, shoppers turned up in droves at grocery stores and Costco locations across the country, as fears about the virus spread and mandated lockdowns seemed inevitable. The pandemic has led many of us to focus on stocking up on groceries and household essentials, while cutting back spending on apparel and other things we don't immediately need. Meantime, by mid-March, many stores deemed nonessential like Macy's and Gap started to shut their doors. Retail sales plunged 8.7% in March, the biggest decline since the government started tracking the sales in 1992. The drop is expected to be even greater in April. We are also in the midst of the worst employment crisis in U.S. history. Over six weeks, 30.3 million Americans have filed for unemployment insurance. Big Red Rooster's Miller predicts, similar to after the Great Recession, consumers will be looking for bargains for quite some time and will think twice before getting a new pair of shoes. Retailers that sell things like clothes, jewelry and other accessories will need to adapt or risk their sales slumping. ""We've just got to figure out a way to be relevant. ... We don't sell things people need, we sell things people want,"" Pete Nordstrom, the department store chain's president and chief brand officer, said last month during a virtual Vogue Global Conference.

This pandemic has accelerated the rate of people meeting, learning, exercising and even dating virtually. And while online shopping was already booming prior to Covid-19 slamming the U.S. economy and forcing many retailers to close their doors, it is even more popular today. Retailers are going to need to get creative, as consumers become more comfortable buying things on the internet. They'll need to find better ways to showcase inventory online, and to make sure shoppers know what size clothes and shoes to buy. Warby Parker, for example, has a virtual try-on feature for its glasses on its website. Companies will need to offer more experiences like this, Miller said.

6. Loyal to brands that give you confidence

The coronavirus pandemic has also gotten us to think global — not just local. ""We are having these shared experiences on a human level,"" Miller explained. ""Maybe you're sitting in your house ... in Ohio ... and seeing people in Italy have the same experience. We're trying to find ways to keep ourselves busy. [The pandemic] is bringing us together globally."" For that reason, she believes consumers will be more conscious of where goods are sourced from and produced, in a post-Covid-19 world. Retailers will also need to be more transparent about their global supply chains, she said. ""This is giving us awareness about how dependent or interconnected we are.""",mainstream,M07c7f,big.foot
1121,"My 2 Cents of Sense: IT IS TIME TO BOARD UP THE BORDER

Jail Mail from James Hovda — Oct 25, 2018 — Thanks to Caithleanne Pont for sharing

Immigration is an issue that resembles the plague… everyone is talking about it, but nobody wants to go near it to fix the damage it creates. Both political parties have steered away from talking about this issue, since blocking immigrants from entering would hurt the Party, or those who back their Party with mega-financing. Democrats see immigration as a weapon to use against Republicans, as the “race card” of bigotry can easily be tossed into play. And, Republicans fold their hand once it has been laid upon the table.

Republicans also see immigration as a weapon to be used to point the finger of shame against Democrats for allowing illegals to do harm to American citizens, yet remain free to hide in the shadows to hurt another. Without uttering a single word of remorse or show a face of sorrow, they all move on as if nothing is happening, and that we citizens need to sit down, mind our own business, and shut the hell up. It is deep anger that now rests upon the faces of most Americans who have watched as little was ever done to discourage illegal border crossings, and with it, all the other related issues, because the people know that… for Democrats, it means votes… and for Republicans, it means cheap labor for their corporate donors.

The old saying of “Don’t bite the hand that feeds you” is very discretely used in Washington politics, more so than ever when it comes to this whole immigration issue. It seems that President Trump is a one man army trying to combat this major problem that stretches America’s security, sanctuary, and sovereignty to the point of snapping into eruption. If politicians really wanted to do something about illegals, the border, and migration, then they have had plenty of time to come up with some very solid, viable solutions. This tells us voters that they don’t give a damn about us, they don’t give a damn about America, and they don’t give a damn about the migrants who are used as a tool to make under-the-table deals, in order to make a lot of money for themselves and their donors by screwing both the migrants and us in the process.

I lived in Arizona for almost a decade back in the 70’s and early 80’s. To most of America back then, this whole immigration issue wasn’t their problem. Illegals have been walking across our open border long before any of us were born, but they were few and far between compared to today. Most came here, picked fruit and vegetables, then took their wages with them as they headed home to their family for 6 months. Everyone was happy, even though everyone knew it was illegal, yet nobody said anything… until 1981, when President Reagan stood before Congress and America to say we had a serious problem that needs to be addressed.

What was a small, yet a contained problem, had rapidly expanded to place a burden upon businesses, schools, hospitals, jails, and communities. During the decade I lived in Arizona, I witnessed the dramatic changes that occurred because of the constant influx of both legal and illegal Hispanics pouring into the state, as Texas, New Mexico, and southern California were also having their demographics dramatically changed. Sections of Phoenix were being taken over by Hispanic “gangs”, as drugs, weapons, and sex trafficking became their main staples. Once quiet streets which you could walk down without fear, soon became part of a district that, if you were a “gringo”, you’d best keep out of… if you knew what was good for you. Country/Western bars soon had trumpets and accordions bellowing the top playlist of Mexico. Low wage jobs once worked by blacks and the non-educated hippies, soon found Lopez, Pedro, and Maria taking their place for a lot less pay. Landscaping, brick laying, roofers, concrete finishers, golf course maintenance, framers… any hand work, small equipment, and housekeeping jobs, quickly saw Hispanics replacing those laborers, because $5/hr was big money for most immigrants, as Hispanics know how to live really cheap.

The streets filled up with “low-riders” that competed at stop lights against one another to see which car could bounce the highest, that gave drivers a fun show, and the cops a headache. The local news began to run stories of increased murder, assaults, rape, and gang violence, showing most offenders to be Hispanic, and most victims to be white. Hospital E-rooms filled beyond capacity, and so did the jails. Local schools had to hire translators, as many children couldn’t speak a word of English. Road signs changed to become bi-lingual, as did documents and public notices. Instead of Arizona forcing Hispanics to adapt to Arizona, the state adapted to the Hispanics. Cinco de Mayo became as celebrated as the Fourth of July.

What really concerned me was that the government was doing little to thwart off the side effects of immigration. I saw it then as I see it now. I stated back in 1983, that if America doesn’t get a handle on the immigration issues, the issues will get a handle upon America. President Reagan tried, but by reluctantly giving amnesty to millions of illegal Hispanics in a trade-off deal with Democrats. Tip O’Neill and Alan Cranston reneged on Reagan’s Immigration and Reform Act by not funding border “protection”, not enforcing employers to “verify” Hispanic’s status, and by not reducing the number of Hispanics allowed in for work visas, and for citizenship. Since then, neither Republicans nor Democrats have stood in defense of that American law.

Not until President Trump has a single president tried to close the border or stop the flow of illegals coming into America. Many have wanted to give amnesty to the ones already here, but that has only encouraged more to come across the border illegally. Since Reagan, cartels have set up shop in America, allowing the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and women. Illegals kill thousands each year in DUI accidents, as assaults, rape, robbery, and murder have gone up 300 percent since the IRA went into effect. Diseases that once were eradicated are now making a comeback.

 Today, we have mayors and even governors seeking sanctuary for any immigrant in order to protect them from any government deportation, regardless of their status… regardless of their crimes. They have basically told Trump and the feds to take a hike. They refuse to abide by the laws of this nation, because they don’t believe in them, nor in this administration.

As you read this, a caravan of over 7,000 “migrants” (and growing by the hundreds each day) from Central and South America is snaking through Mexico in order to crash America’s borders. To the Democrats and the Left, they are “refugees” who are fleeing their homeland of tyranny and oppression. There are no jobs, no food, no medicine, as crime has ravaged the land to remove any freedom or liberty they had. To Trump and us patriots, we see it as an invasion that must be met with force at the border’s edge, if needed. Not a single one should be allowed to enter into our sovereignty. Because of liberal judges and Left-wing courts, all they need to do is step one foot in and request asylum from being persecuted. We have no option but to let them in, and to take care of their every need.

What this will create is a Cloward-Piven effect of overwhelming our systems in order to crash the systems. The Democrats, who hope to regain power this election cycle, plan to revise the whole immigration and border problem by disregarding that there is any problem at all, and to let immigrants come and go as they please without anyone stopping them. Can you see mass chaos and mayhem in the near future if this is allowed?

Although there is speculation and no verification other than someone saying it is true, we are learning that the Democrats and certain globalist money dirt-bags (e.g. Soros) created this caravan, and are financing their journey in order to disrupt the election, create a “no-win” scandal for Trump, and put a tailspin upon the fast improving economy in order to reverse it. We have pretty well verified that many within this caravan are prison releases, gang members, and even Islamic fundamentalists posing as Hispanics. And if this is true, then not a single one can be allowed to set foot into the United States. Everyone must be thoroughly vetted from now on.

President Trump has vowed to place the US military on the border, even though the Dems are already saying they will use it to impeach Trump when they win back Congress, as it falls under “posse comitatus”. The Democrats need to read the law, and read where exactly the Executive Power can reach. The president can call in the Marines if there is an “invasion” from those planning to do harm to the country, and even defend the border by force to prevent entry. Bikers and militias from every state plan to stand with Trump to assist in this oncoming assault. As Andrew Wilkow said on radio today, “This may get very, very ugly!”

It now seems that the Left is putting “we citizens” on the Right into a Catch-22 scenario, where we are damned if we take action… damned if we don’t. The law is most certainly on our side on this one, but the Left no longer respects “our” laws, and defies their existence with total disregard to consequences. Their media, their lawyers, their judges, their universities, and their “MOBS” will revolt and cry out “viva la revolution” if we take any action to stop the illegal’s invasion. As Tucker Carlson states in his best seller, ‘Ship of Fools’: “Our leaders need to be concerned about immigration, but they’re not. Instead they work to make the country even less stable, by encouraging rapid demographic change. With the enthusiastic consent of both political parties, more than 15 million illegal immigrants have been allowed to enter the United States, work jobs, and use public services in a country they are not legally allowed to use, let alone legally live in. Those service are allowed only for legal citizens. It is those who made those modified policies who benefit, in both financial and authoritative power.”

Carlson continues by saying; “If you grew up in America between the 50’s and 2000, suddenly nothing looks the same. The neighborhood is different, the neighbors are different, so is the landscape and the customs and so often the language you hear on the street. You might not recognize your hometown, or even your native state… you might not even recognize the country any longer. Humans are not wired for dramatic changes. They can’t rationalize changes at record pace, because it disorients them. It makes even the most open-minded people jumpy and hostile and suspicious of one another… it encourages tribalism.”

“Those who deny these changes are bigots, and need to be severely dealt with”, declares the Left. The establishment rulers no longer want a nation of European, Christian, and English speaking people, but a nation of ethnic minorities, immense religious pluralism, and no universally shared culture or language. They want diversity across the board, and will do whatever is necessary in order to achieve it.

It is by no accident that thousands picked up their children to walk a thousand miles in desert heat with no supplies only to come to America “for a better life”, all at the same time. They had to be organized, supplied, and encouraged. It is also by no accident that this comes now at a time of an election that will have consequences by which side wins. Once those immigrants reach the border, they won’t go home. And what is there to stop them, in short of being shot swimming across the Rio Grande? Can our border agents stop what we witnessed on the border of Guatemala, as thousands stormed the gates, tore it down, and proceeded to beat the “Federales” who stood in their way to death?

 It is imperative that Congress finds the funds to finish the border wall as President Trump wants. It is also imperative that our law makers understand that we have laws for a reason, and that to be “a nation of laws”, those laws must be enforced.

Until bricks, steel, and concrete can erect a barrier that prevents access, Americans must use whatever means necessary to board up the border to prevent maybe tens of thousands of illegal immigrants from gaining access to our land. The Left can yell and scream all they like about “human rights” and being “un-American,” but if you ask the people, the MAJORITY wants this stopped, the wall built, and the laws supported. And if this new scheme of the Left turns into bloodshed, may it be on their hands, for Americans are only protecting their homeland from invaders who plan to continue the demise of our democracy, and the establishment of a class of rulers who don’t care about any of us, just so long as the ends justifies the means to their full control, and our total demotion into serfdom.

196,"TMZ: The former Prez is still living it up in Hawaii in the new year, and he’s moved from the golf course to the ocean for some paddleboarding fun … which looks like quite a workout too.

So I came across this article about Obama on vacation in Hawaii. I found something interesting within the images, yes Michelle was no where to be found on the beach in a bikini. lol but The interesting thing is located on Obama’s foot, not the ankle strap for the board. Look at the other foot; That looks like a GPS ankle tracker.

Now I have read many ideas people had about what it could be. A frequency device to scare off sharks, a gps tracker or some other type of smart device. So what are your thoughts? Is he secretly on ‘house arrest’? I doubt it but we can only hope Hillary Clinton has one of these trackers on her ankles as well. 🙂 Wishful thinking!",conspiracy,C0250b,big.foot
56,"I was thrilled to be on hand at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama when staff scientist Carlos Jaramillo and others published their amazing find of the world's largest snake—42 feet long and weighing 2,500 pounds (previous records were 33 feet and 403 pounds). Actually, 28 of these giant snakes have been found.

Since I am a geological engineer, it was even more interesting for me to tour Jaramillo's most recent project at the Panama Canal. Massive new excavations to allow the world's biggest ships to pass through via a third, larger set of locks have exposed geological formations that date back 17 million years and given Jaramillo an opportunity to help solve a puzzle: how and when the land bridge connecting North and South America formed. Jaramillo's group collects newly uncovered fossils and compares them with fossils found in North America from the same time period. The comparisons should shed light on the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, which began about 20 million years ago; the closure of that isthmus some three million years ago launched two of our planet's great experiments in biodiversity. The first, the Great American Interchange, began when the fauna and flora of North America invaded South America and vice versa across the newly formed land bridge. The second began when the isthmus formed a barrier, dividing marine organisms into Caribbean and eastern Pacific populations.

During my visit to STRI, I also took in the cacophonous whoops of howler monkeys and rode high above the forest canopy in a research gondola held aloft by a construction crane; I observed butterfly aerobatics and working ant colonies. STRI's focus is Barro Colorado Island, located in the canal's Gatun Lake; its 1,316 plant species, 381 bird species and 115 mammal species are among the world's most intensively studied. Institute scientists are illuminating how forests capture carbon from the atmosphere, studying the health of coral reefs and documenting invasive species. This and other STRI science will inform exhibits at the Smithsonian-affiliated Museum of Biodiversity (BioMuseo) next to STRI labs at the Pacific end of the canal. Designed by Frank Gehry, the new museum will open next year, just in time to celebrate the Smithsonian's 100-year partnership with Panama.

Those among you less interested in geology might still be wondering about the snakes. Not to worry. They preferred eating crocodiles and giant turtles. And the discovery was of snake fossils (mostly backbones) in the remote jungles of Colombia; the snakes, called Titanoboas, lived some 60 million years ago.

65,"UK garage, also known as UKG, is a genre of electronic music which originated in England in the early 1990s. The genre blends styles such as garage house, R&B, jungle and dance-pop. It usually features a percussive, shuffled 4/4 breakbeat rhythm with syncopated hi-hats, cymbals and snares, and sometimes includes irregular kick drum patterns. Garage tracks also commonly feature 'chopped up' and time-stretched or pitch-shifted vocal samples complementing the underlying rhythmic structure at a tempo usually around 130 BPM. UK garage gave rise to subgenres such as speed garage and 2-step, and was then largely subsumed into other styles of music and production in the mid-2000s, including bassline, grime and dubstep. The decline of UK garage during the mid-2000s saw the birth of UK funky, which is closely related.

The evolution of house music in the United Kingdom in the mid-1990s led to the term, as previously coined by the Paradise Garage DJs, being applied to a new form of music also known speed garage. Its originator is widely recognised to be Todd Edwards, the American house and garage producer, also known as Todd ""The God"" Edwards[citation needed]. In the early nineties, Edwards began to start remixing more soulful house records and incorporating more time-shifts and vocal samples than normal house records, whilst still living in the US. However, it was not until DJ EZ, the North London DJ, acquired one of Edwards' tracks and played it at a faster tempo in a nightclub in Greenwich, that the music genre really took off.

In the late nineties, the term ""UK garage"" was settled upon by the scene. This style is now frequently combined with other forms of music like soul, rap, reggae, ragga and R&B, all broadly filed under the description of urban music. The pronunciation of UK garage uses GARR-ij, rather than gə-rahzh.[1]

Artists such as Craig David, Grant Nelson, MJ Cole, Artful Dodger, Jaimeson, So Solid Crew, Heartless Crew, The Streets, Shanks & Bigfoot, DJ Luck & MC Neat, Sunship (Ceri Evans), Oxide and Neutrino and numerous others have made garage music mainstream in the UK, whilst Dizzee Rascal, Wiley and Kano's arrival raised the profile of grime, an offshoot of garage.

Cole once stated, ""London is a multicultural city... it's like a melting pot of young people, and that's reflected in the music of UK garage"".[2]

Notable female singers who have had the genre incorporated into their songs include Lisa Maffia, Ms. Dynamite, Kele Le Roc, Shola Ama, Sweet Female Attitude and Mis-Teeq.

In the United Kingdom, where jungle was very popular at the time, garage was played in a second room at jungle events. After jungle's peak in cultural significance, it had turned towards a harsher, more techstep influenced sound, driving away dancers, predominantly women. Escaping the 170bpm jungle basslines, the garage rooms had a much more sensual and soulful sound at 130bpm.[3]

DJs started to speed up garage tracks to make them more suitable for the jungle audience in the UK. The media started to call this tempo-altered type of garage music ""speed garage"", 4x4 and 2-step's predecessor. DJs would usually play dub versions (arrangements without vocals) of garage tracks, because pitch-shifting vocals could sometimes render the music unrecognizable (although sped up and time-stretched vocals were an important part of the early jungle sound, and later played a key role in speed garage). The absence of vocals left space in the music for MCs, who started rhyming to the records.

Since then, MCs have become one of the vital aspects of speed and UK garage parties and records. Early promoters of speed garage included the Dreem Teem and Tuff Jam, and pirate radio stations such as London Underground, Magic FM, Upfront FM, and Freek FM. During its initial phase, the speed garage scene was also known as ""the Sunday Scene"", as initially speed garage promoters could only hire venues on Sunday evenings (venue owners preferred to save Friday and Saturday nights for more popular musical styles). Labels whose outputs would become synonymous with the emerging speed garage sound included Confetti, Public Demand, 500 Rekords, Spread Love and VIP.

Speed garage already incorporated many aspects of today's UK garage sound like sub-bass lines, ragga vocals, spin backs and reversed drums. What changed over time, until the so-called 2-step sound emerged, was the addition of further funky elements like contemporary R&B styled vocals, more shuffled beats and a different drum pattern. The most radical change from speed garage to 2-step was the removal of the 2nd and 4th bass kick from each bar. Although tracks with only two kick drum beats to a bar are perceived as being slower than the traditional four-to-the-floor beat, the listener's interest is maintained by the introduction of syncopating bass lines and the percussive use of other instruments such as pads and strings.

Speed garage tracks were characterised by a sped-up house-style beat, complemented by the rolling snares and reverse-warped basslines that were popular with drum and bass producers of the time.

Among those credited with honing the speed garage sound, Todd Edwards is often cited as a seminal influence on the UK garage sound. The producer from New Jersey introduced a new way of working with vocals. Instead of having full verses and choruses, he picked out vocal phrases and played them like an instrument, using sampling technology.[4] Often, individual syllables were reversed or pitch-shifted. This type of vocal treatment is still a key characteristic of the UK garage style. Armand Van Helden's speed garage remix of Sneaker Pimps' ""Spin Spin Sugar"" in 1997 further popularized the genre which is sometimes credited with breaking speed garage into the mainstream. Huge club hits in 1997 came from speed garage duos Double 99, 187 Lockdown and Industry Standard. The former two both scored UK Top 20 hits in 1997 and 1998; Double 99's ""RipGroove"" reached #14 in its second release and 187 Lockdown's ""Gunman"" and ""Kung-Fu"" reached #16 and #9, respectively. Industry Standard scored a Top 40 hit with ""Vol. 1 (What You Want What You Need)"" peaking at #34 in January 1998,[5] and the 1997 XL Recordings release of Somore featuring Damon Trueitt's ""I Refuse (What You Want)"" reached #21 also in January 1998,[6] containing mixes by Industry Standard, Ramsey & Fen, R.I.P. Productions and Serious Danger. The UK's counterpart to Todd Edwards was MJ Cole, a classically trained oboe and piano player, who had a string of chart and underground hits in the late 1990s and early 2000s, most notably with ""Sincere"" and ""Crazy Love"". MJ Cole has also won a BBC ""Young Musician of the Year"" award.[7]

Arguably one of the earliest examples of a 2-step track is the 1997 hit ""Never Gonna Let You Go"" by Tina Moore, which peaked at #7 on the UK chart. Roy Davis Jr. was also influential in the UK garage scene, with the huge club hit ""Gabriel"" featuring Peven Everett, released in 1997 on XL Recordings and reaching #22 on the UK chart. Lovestation released their version of ""Teardrops"" which reached #14 in 1998. Doolally, the former name of Shanks & Bigfoot, scored a #20 hit in 1998 with ""Straight from the Heart"". A re-release of this song the following year fared even better, peaking at #9, due to the success of their #1 single ""Sweet Like Chocolate"". Jess Jackson was responsible for many garage records but one which stood out was ""Hobson's Choice"". The B-side of this record changed the UK garage scene from funky and soulful to dark and bassy. Another example of the evolution in 2-step was the release of ""Troublesome"" in 1999 by Shy Cookie and DJ Luck, in which non-sampled 2-step beats were merged with a full ragga vocal (performed by ragga artist Troublesome).

Timbaland, a popular contemporary R&B producer in America, was the major innovator behind contemporary R&B at the time, from which UK rave culture borrowed heavily. The use of rhythmic patterns as melodic hooks is shared by both contemporary R&B and jungle, making it very appealing to the significantly ex-junglist UK garage scene. This style of Timbaland's R&B possesses a breakbeat aesthetic: breakup of the flow of four-to-the-floor rhythm, hesitations into the groove, and teasing and tantalizing gaps. As much as these R&B influences can be heard in early UK garage, the genre offered more complex drum beats, with heavy syncopation (swing) and a more energetic feel due to a higher tempo (normally between 130 and 138 BPM). However, in tracks like ""Twentyfourseven"" by Artful Dodger, a slower and simpler R&B infused drum pattern can be heard. This was to allow for these tracks to be aimed at a more commercial scene rather than for the dance floor. Garage producers then proceeded to churn out UK versions of US contemporary R&B hits, notably with Brandy and Monica's ""The Boy Is Mine"". The Architechs sped up the vocals through time-stretching and added sound effects to increase the competitive nature. ""B&M Remix"" eventually sold twenty thousand copies as a bootleg.[3]

Also borrowed from US contemporary R&B is the use of ""vocal science"", the technique of digitally altering vocal samples with devices such as the Autotuner. What results is a posthuman mix between person and technology.[3]

With the continued support of pirate radio stations such as Rinse FM, Ice FM, Deja Vu, and Flex FM, the soaring popularity of UK garage saw 1999 take the genre into the mainstream, breaking into the music charts. Production duos Shanks & Bigfoot and Artful Dodger were very successful with the tracks ""Sweet Like Chocolate"" and ""Re-Rewind"", respectively. After the platinum-selling success of ""Sweet Like Chocolate"", the floodgates had opened. Although ""Re-Rewind"" was denied a #1 position by Cliff Richard and his song ""The Millennium Prayer"", it was also a platinum seller, one of the garage scene's first and last. They became anthems for the 2-step scene, and got onto BBC's Top of the Pops. Other huge hits in 1999 include the #1 house/garage anthem ""You Don't Know Me"" by Armand Van Helden. Although not UK garage, Mr. Oizo's #1 single ""Flat Beat"" received extensive airplay on pirate radio stations upon release, thus leading to numerous UK garage/2-step remixes of the track. Da Click (Pied Piper, MC Creed, PSG, Unknown MC and singer Valerie M) had a #14 hit with ""Good Rhymes"". Garage trio the Dreem Teem had a #15 hit with ""Buddy X 99"", a garage remix of Neneh Cherry's 1992 song ""Buddy X"". DJ Luck & MC Neat also had a chart hit with ""A Little Bit of Luck"" in late 1999 into early 2000.

Many more UK garage acts followed into the new millennium by releasing commercially successful singles, thus making UK garage and 2-step a stable fixture on the UK charts for the next couple of years. Debut singles of various UK garage artists were hitting the number one spot on the UK charts. Craig David's debut solo single ""Fill Me In"", a mix of R&B and 2-step, with single formats containing various garage remixes of the track, hit #1 in April 2000. A month later, Oxide & Neutrino's ""Bound 4 Da Reload (Casualty)"" reached the top of the charts. Other hits in 2000 include Artful Dodger's ""Movin' Too Fast"" (#2), ""Woman Trouble"" (#6) and ""Please Don't Turn Me On"" (#4), Sweet Female Attitude's ""Flowers"" (#2), True Steppers' ""Buggin"" (#6) and ""Out of Your Mind"" (#2), N'n'G featuring Kallaghan and MC Neat's ""Right Before My Eyes"" (#12), DJ Dee Kline's ""I Don't Smoke"" (#11), B-15 Project's ""Girls Like Us"" (#7), DJ Luck & MC Neat's ""Masterblaster 2000"" (#5) and ""Ain't No Stoppin' Us"" (#8), Shanks & Bigfoot's ""Sing-A-Long"" (#12), MJ Cole's ""Crazy Love"" (#10) and ""Sincere"" (#13), the latter a re-release, having been originally released in 1998; Scott & Leon's ""You Used to Hold Me"" (#19), Wookie's ""Battle"" (#10), Lonyo's ""Summer of Love"" (#8), Tru Faith & Dub Conspiracy's ""Freak Like Me"" (#12), Architechs' ""Body Groove"" (#3), Oxide & Neutrino's ""No Good 4 Me"" (#6) and Baby D's ""Let Me Be Your Fantasy"" (#16), a garage remix by Trick or Treat featuring MC Tails. Another huge hit in 2000 was the Timo Maas remix of the song ""Dooms Night"" (#8) by German producer Azzido Da Bass, which was heavily associated with UK garage at the time, having become a major club hit and appearing on several UK garage compilations. It was also remixed by garage duo Stanton Warriors.[7]

2001 gave DJ Pied Piper and the Masters of Ceremonies their one and only number one hit record with ""Do You Really Like It?"". Two months later in August 2001, South London collective So Solid Crew hit the top spot with their second single ""21 Seconds"". The end of 2001 saw yet another 2-step anthem reach the top of the UK charts for Daniel Bedingfield, with his debut single ""Gotta Get Thru This"". Other chart hits in 2001 include the Sunship mixes of Mis-Teeq's ""Why"" (#8), ""All I Want"" (#2) and ""One Night Stand"" (#5), Artful Dodger's ""Think About Me"" (#11), ""TwentyFourSeven"" (#6) and ""It Ain't Enough"" with the Dreem Teem (#20), Genius Cru's ""Boom Selection"" (#12), Liberty's ""Thinking It Over"" (#5), Sticky featuring Ms. Dynamite's ""Booo!"" (#12), Oxide & Neutrino's ""Up Middle Finger"" (#7), ""Devil's Nightmare"" (#16) and ""Rap Dis""/""Only Wanna Know U Cos Ure Famous"" (#12), DJ Luck & MC Neat's ""Piano Loco"" (#12) and ""I'm All About You"" (#18), The Streets' ""Has It Come to This?"" (#18), Wideboys' ""Sambuca"" (#15), and So Solid Crew's ""They Don't Know"" (#3).

2002 saw an evolution as 2-step moved away from its funky and soul-oriented sound into a darker direction called ""grime"", now a genre in its own right. During this period, traditional UK garage was pushed back underground amongst the bad publicity emanating from the tougher side of the genre, and publicised violence surrounding members of the So Solid Crew. Nonetheless, several UK garage songs did appear on the charts from 2002 to 2004, including Distant Soundz' version of ""Time After Time"" (#20), So Solid Crew's ""Haters"" (#8) and ""Ride wid Us"" (#19), Mis-Teeq's ""B with Me"" (#5), Heartless Crew's ""The Heartless Theme"" (#21), Pay As U Go's ""Champagne Dance"" (#13), Jaimeson's ""True"" (#4), Mr Reds vs DJ Skribble's ""Everybody Come On (Can U Feel It)"" (#13), and 3 of a Kind's ""Baby Cakes"" which was a number one hit in August 2004.

Notable early grime artists around 2001–03 include Ruff Sqwad, More Fire Crew, Dizzee Rascal (who released his debut album Boy in da Corner in 2003), Roll Deep and Wiley.

During this time, there was also a strong division of class in UK garage. In the heyday of garage, the late 1990s, it was a highly aspirational genre. When people went to the club to hear garage, they dressed very nice. Clubs like Twice as Nice enforced a dress code. Having a formal dress code took the importance placed on nice clothes from a style to exclusionary. The dress code in clubs like Twice as Nice were meant to ""encourage people to make an effort"" and ""keep trouble out."" But when the dress code of no tennis shoes, jeans, or baseball caps only kept white college students out, the club installed a metal detector, because ""gangstas like to dress expensive,"" but theoretically could still carry a gun.[3] Eventually, when groups like So Solid Crew attracted more urban, lower-class audiences to raves because of their lyrics over the garage tracks, garage began to transition to grime because previous audiences were less likely to listen, so radios and clubs stopped giving garage opportunities.[8]

In 2007, several DJs helped promote and revive UK garage's popularity, with producers creating new UK garage, also known as ""new skool"" UK garage or ""bassline"".

The end of 2007 saw ""new skool"" UK garage push to the mainstream again with notable tracks such as T2's ""Heartbroken"" and H ""Two"" O's ""What's It Gonna Be"" both reaching the mainstream charts. The revival was galvanised by DJ EZ releasing Pure Garage Rewind: Back to the Old Skool, which contained three CDs of ""old skool"" UK garage and a fourth CD with fresh ""new skool"" UK garage.

Early 2011 saw the start of a gradual resurgence of 2-step garage.[9] Producers such as Wookie, MJ Cole, Zed Bias and Mark Hill (formerly one half of Artful Dodger) made a return to the scene, by producing tracks with more of a 2-step feel. Electronic music duos Disclosure and AlunaGeorge, both successful throughout 2012 and 2013, often use elements of UK garage in their music, and arguably, some of their biggest hits including ""You & Me"" and ""We Are Chosen"" respectively, are entirely 2-step with an updated cleaner sound. Shortly following this, ""original"" style garage had made a return in a big way, with producers such as Moony, DJD and Tuff Culture paving the way. One of the genre's pioneering labels, Ice Cream Records, responsible for anthems such as ""RipGroove"", True Steppers' ""Out of Your Mind"", Kele Le Roc's ""My Love"" and more, opened up their permanent roster for the first time to include DJs outside of the legendary trio that launched the label.

AJ Tracey's song ""Ladbroke Grove"" initially debuted at number 48 on the UK Singles Chart in February 2019, then eventually peaked at number three in October 2019 following its release as a single. In September 2019, the British Phonographic Industry certified the song as Platinum for exceeding chart sales of 600,000. It was one of the best-selling songs of 2019.[10]

Other hits in the 2010s include Toddla T's ""Take It Back"", All About She's ""Higher (Free)"", Naughty Boy's ""La La La"", Shift K3Y's ""Touch"", Chase & Status' ""Blk & Blu"", M.O's ""Dance On My Own"", Disclosure's ""Omen"" and Craig David's ""When the Bassline Drops"" and ""One More Time"".

The dark garage sound that was being produced by the likes of Wookie, Zed Bias, Shy Cookie, El-B and Artwork (of DND) in the late 1990s would set the groundwork for both grime and a genre called dubstep. Developing in parallel to grime, dubstep would take a mostly instrumental stripped down form of dark garage and with it bring in production values and influences from dub reggae.

Some UK garage/dubstep/grime/bassline producers have moved to a different sound called UK funky, which takes production values from many different shades of soulful house music with elements of UK garage and blends them at a standard house music tempo, and soca with tribal style percussion from afrobeat.

1042,"NEW YORK (AP) — A superstorm that sent water rushing onto city streets has left a large swath of the lower part of Manhattan without power. Consolidated Edison spokesman Chris Olert said Monday evening that the power was out for most of Manhattan south of 26th Street.

On the east side, the power outage extended from 29th Street south. There were some scattered areas that still had electricity. Olert said the damage stemmed from flooding and the probable loss of a transmission feeder.

The power outage was separate from a planned power cut that Con Ed did in certain lower Manhattan neighborhoods to protect underwater systems from flood damage. Olert said there were 250,000 customers without power in Manhattan. A customer represents a single meter, so the number of people actually affected is likely higher.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP’s earlier story is below.

Superstorm Sandy zeroed in on New York’s waterfront with fierce rain and winds that shuttered most of the nation’s largest city Monday, darkened the financial district and left a huge crane hanging off a luxury high-rise.

The threat of a record 13-foot storm surge inundating downtown Manhattan prompted officials to close the mass transit system and cut power pre-emptively to parts of downtown Manhattan to avoid damage from incoming seawater.

“The worst of it is about to hit,” Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Monday evening before Sandy, stripped of its hurricane status but just as strong and dangerous, made landfall in southern New Jersey.

Water began lapping over the lower Manhattan seawall earlier, about ankle-deep, as officials anxiously awaited high tide. Water began pooling in rail yards and on highways near the Hudson River waterfront on Manhattan’s far west side.

On coastal Long Island, floodwaters swamped cars, downed trees and put neighborhoods under water as beachfronts and fishing villages bore the brunt of the storm. A police car was lost rescuing 14 people from the popular resort Fire Island.

The storm had only killed one New Yorker by Monday night, a man who died when a tree fell on his home in the Flushing section of Queens.

The collapsed crane suspended over midtown caused the evacuation of hundreds from a posh hotel and other buildings. Inspectors were climbing 74 flights of stairs to examine it. Meteorologists said the winds could have been close to 95 mph at the top of the $1.5 billion building when the crane tipped.

The facade of a four-story Manhattan building in the Chelsea neighborhood crumbled and collapsed suddenly, leaving the lights, couches, cabinets and desks inside visible from the street. No one was hurt, although some of the falling debris hit a car.

The city shut its subways, schools, stock exchanges, Broadway theaters and closed several bridges and tunnels throughout the day as the weather worsened. Late Monday, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey closed LaGuardia Airport, although major carriers had cancelled all their flights hours earlier.

Consolidated Edison cut power pre-emptively to parts of Manhattan bordered by the Brooklyn Bridge and the East River, trying to lessen damage to underground equipment from the massive storm, spokesman Chris Olert said. About 6,500 customers lost power, he said; the utility reported more than 65,000 outages from the storm in the city and suburban Westchester County.

Earlier, some New Yorkers defiantly soldiered on, trying to salvage normal routines and refusing to evacuate, as the mayor ordered 375,000 in low-lying areas to do.

Mark Vial pushed a stroller holding his 2-year-old daughter Maziyar toward his apartment building in Battery Park City, an area that was ordered evacuated. “We’re high up enough, so I’m not worried about flooding,” said Via, 35. “There’s plenty of food. We’ll be OK.

But by early evening, the water in New York Harbor was rising and winds sent a trash can blowing down the street in Battery Park City. Brian Damianakes, 47, took shelter in an ATM vestibule.

“I decided to go for a run about five minutes ago but now I’m thinking maybe not,” he said. “Now it’s really turning into something.”

On New York’s Long Island, floodwaters had begun to deluge some low-lying towns and nearly 150,000 customers had lost power. Cars floated along the streets of Long Beach and flooding consumed several blocks south of the bay, residents said.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo, holding a news conference on Long Island where the lights flickered and his mike went in and out, said most of the National Guards deployed to the New York City area would go to Long Island.

“Long Island has become more and more vulnerable and the primary area of our concentration,” he said.

In the fishing village of Greenport, Sean Seal piled dirt and sandbags onto the alleyway behind his collectibles store where the water was steadily creeping up the street toward his front door. He only opened the shop about two months ago.

“We put everything up. Up on tables, up on shelves, as far as we could,” he said. “It’s gonna be devastating. We’ll lose a lot of stuff.”

“We have no more beach. It’s gone,” she said, shaking her head as she watched the waves go under the boardwalk.

The center the storm, a combination of Sandy, a wintry system from the West and cold air streaming from the Arctic, was expected to hit the city under a full moon later Monday night. Surging waters of between 6 and 11 feet could flood subway tunnels, knock out the underground network of power, phone and high-speed Internet lines that are the lifeblood of America’s financial capital.

Waters rose, but hadn’t breached the seawall by early Monday evening. Despite the dire forecasts, many chose to embrace what was coming.

128,"Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that develops when your pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone during adulthood. When this happens, your bones increase in size, including those of your hands, feet and face. Acromegaly usually affects middle-aged adults.

Acromegaly usually affects middle-aged adults, though it can develop at any age. In children who are still growing, too much growth hormone can cause a condition called gigantism. These children have exaggerated bone growth and an abnormal increase in height.

Because acromegaly is uncommon and physical changes occur gradually, the condition sometimes takes a long time to recognize. If it's not treated promptly, acromegaly can lead to serious illness and may even become life-threatening. But available treatments can reduce your risk of complications and significantly improve characteristics of the condition, including the enlargement of your features.

A common sign of acromegaly is enlarged hands and feet. People with this disorder often notice that they aren't able to put on rings that used to fit and that their shoe size has progressively increased.

Acromegaly may also cause gradual changes in the shape of your face, such as a protruding lower jaw and brow, an enlarged nose, thickened lips, and wider spacing between your teeth.

Because acromegaly tends to progress slowly, early signs may not be obvious for years. Sometimes, people notice the condition only by comparing old photographs with newer ones.

Acromegaly may produce the following signs and symptoms, which can vary from one person to another:
• Severe snoring due to obstruction of the upper airway
• Enlarged organs, such as the heart

When to see a doctor

If you have signs and symptoms associated with acromegaly, contact your doctor for an evaluation.

Acromegaly usually develops slowly. Even your family members may not initially notice the gradual physical changes that occur with this disorder, but early diagnosis is important so that you can start getting proper care. Acromegaly can lead to serious complications if it's not treated.

Acromegaly is caused by the pituitary gland overproducing growth hormone (GH) over time. The pituitary gland, a small gland situated at the base of your brain behind the bridge of your nose, produces a number of hormones. GH plays an important role in managing your physical growth.

When GH is secreted into your bloodstream, it triggers your liver to produce a hormone called insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). In turn, IGF-I stimulates the growth of bones and other tissues.

If your pituitary gland makes too much GH, excessive amounts of IGF-I can result. Too much IGF-I can cause abnormal growth of your soft tissues and skeleton and other signs and symptoms characteristic of acromegaly and gigantism.

In adults, a tumor is the most common cause of too much GH production:
• Pituitary tumors. Most cases of acromegaly are caused by a noncancerous (benign) tumor (adenoma) of the pituitary gland. The tumor secretes excessive amounts of growth hormone, causing many of the signs and symptoms of acromegaly. Some of the symptoms of acromegaly, such as headaches and impaired vision, are due to the tumor mass pressing on nearby brain tissues.
• Nonpituitary tumors. In a few people with acromegaly, tumors in other parts of the body, such as the lungs or pancreas, cause the disorder. Sometimes, these tumors secrete GH. In other cases, the tumors produce a hormone called growth hormone-releasing hormone (GH-RH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to make more GH.

Progression of acromegaly can result in major health problems. Complications may include:
• Cardiovascular disease, particularly enlargement of the heart (cardiomyopathy)
• Precancerous growths (polyps) on the lining of your colon
• Sleep apnea, a condition in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep

Early treatment of acromegaly can prevent these complications from developing or becoming worse. Untreated, acromegaly and its complications can lead to premature death.",mainstream,M0adcc,big.foot
221,"Birds vary greatly in foot size and shape relating to locomotion, feeding, and reproduction (Elphick, Dunning, Jack, & Sibley, 2001; Kochan, 1994; Proctor & Lynch, 1993). Legs and feet of birds play important roles in walking (most species), running (ostriches, grouse, turkeys), climbing (woodpeckers, nuthatches, tree‐creepers), swimming and steering underwater (ducks, grebes, loons), perching (as on a branch) or clinging (Elphick et al., 2001; Kochan, 1994; Proctor & Lynch, 1993). Other functions include carrying (like ospreys Pandion haliaetus holding fish) and flight‐related locomotion (Elphick et al., 2001; Kochan, 1994; Proctor & Lynch, 1993). Feeding and related functions of feet include capture and killing of prey and pulling apart food (with help from the bill). Some grebes may even run on water for mate acquisition (Clifton, Hedrick, & Biewener, 2015).

Webbed feet are characteristic features of bird species living in aquatic habitats (Elphick et al., 2001; Kochan, 1994; Proctor & Lynch, 1993). Sea ducks rely on both webbed feet and wings for diving, sweeping their webbed feet backwards (Richman & Lovvorn, 2008). Loons Gavia immer swim by paddling their feet laterally as in grebes and cormorants (Clifton & Biewener, 2018). Eiders use both wing and foot propulsion during descent. The power face of foot strokes coincides with the transition between upstroke and downstroke of the wings (Heath, Gilchrist, & Ydenberg, 2006). The delta shape of their webbed feet is able to generate propulsive forces from drag at the start of the stroke of the feet to the lift later in the stroke (Johansson & Norberg, 2003). Some sea ducks use both feet and wings to swim (Richman & Lovvorn, 2008). The use of both feet and wings increased bottom duration by 59% compared to dives with feet only with potential consequences for ingestion rate (Richman & Lovvorn, 2008).

Webbed feet are often large, and they show considerable variation in size among individuals (A. P. Møller pers. obs.), raising the question what is the basis for such variation. Surprisingly, there is no publication dealing with the consequences of intraspecific variation in size of webbed feet, and this deficit prompted our study. If large feet are beneficial, we assume that a larger foot size is associated with a larger locomotor apparatus such as a larger wing area and a larger heart. Although there is a genetic basis for the size of webbed feet (Ganan, Macias, Basco, Merino, & Hurle, 1998), and the varied and important roles that feet play across bird species, there is currently a significant lack of understanding of the functional significance of foot size.

Eiders are well‐known capital breeders (relying on stored food throughout the incubation period) that build up body reserves during winter for subsequent breeding in spring and early summer (Meijer & Drent, 1999). Female eiders arrive during spring entering colonies and producing a clutch of 4–5 eggs that are incubated for about 26 days. The female sits on the nest during this period without feeding. Therefore, females must build up sufficient body reserves for breeding at the wintering grounds and off the breeding grounds (Hobson, Jaatinen, & Öst, 2015). During winter, eiders are located off shore in large flocks feeding on benthos at 4–8 m depth, with a range of 0–20 m (Petersen et al., 2010). In the prebreeding period, they stay near the shore feeding in shallow water. Studies in the Wadden Sea have shown that the number of eiders increases with mussel stocks, and individuals feeding on mussels have superior body condition than those taking other types of prey, which makes it attractive for eiders to feed on mussel beds (Laursen, Asferg, Frikke, & Sunde, 2009; Laursen & Frikke, 2008; Nehls & Ketzenberg, 2002). Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis ) can affect feeding condition of eiders by increasing flesh content and by increasing the size of mussel stocks (Laursen, Møller, Haugaard, Öst, & Vainio, 2019.

The objectives of this study were to test (a) whether intraspecific variation in the size of webbed feet is related to the size of the locomotor apparatus as reflected by wings and its underlying muscular basis in heart and breast muscle; (b) whether the diet is related to the area of the webbed feet, and hence whether the size of the liver as a storage organ increases with the area of the webbed feet. Vitamin E is the main fat‐soluble antioxidant stored in the liver (Møller, Laursen, & Karadas, 2019). Larger webbed feet would imply greater diving ability and hence a reduction in the amount of stored vitamin E (Møller et al., 2019). Finally, (c) if birds with larger webbed feet acquire more food per unit time, this should result in a reduction in the duration of the molting period which again would result in a reduction in the duration of exposure to predators such as white‐tailed sea eagle Haliaeetus albicilla that is the main cause of mortality. Viain, Guillemette, and Savard (2015) showed that eiders had lower flight muscle reduction than foot‐propelled diving ducks during molt, apparently as a means of maintenance of the ability to escape from predators.

We tested whether the size of the uropygial gland that is involved in feather maintenance and anti‐microbial activity increases with the area of webbed feet. Because effects of larger webbed feet may be confounded by effects of body size, we included the first principal component as a measure of skeletal body size in the statistical analyses. We used a sample of 233 eiders (Somateria mollissima ) shot during 2015–2018 in Danish waters during winter (January‐February; N = 182) and at prebreeding grounds at Åland, Finland in the central part of the Baltic Sea (April–May; N = 51) to test these predictions.",mainstream,M0a992,big.foot

705,"Genetic testing confirms the legendary Bigfoot is a human relative that arose some 15,000 years ago — at least according to a press release issued by a company called DNA Diagnostics detailing supposed work by a Texas veterinarian.

The release and alleged study by Melba S. Ketchum also suggests such cryptids had sex with modern human females that resulted in hairy hominin hybrids -- but the scientific community is dubious about her claim.

""A team of scientists can verify that their five-year long DNA study, currently under peer-review, confirms the existence of a novel hominin hybrid species, commonly called 'Bigfoot' or 'Sasquatch,' living in North America,"" the release reads. ""Researchers' extensive DNA sequencing suggests that the legendary Sasquatch is a human relative that arose approximately 15,000 years ago.""

For her study, Ketchum obtained three ""whole nuclear genomes from purported Sasquatch samples. The genome sequencing shows that Sasquatch mtDNA is identical to modern Homo sapiens, but Sasquatch nuDNA is a novel, unknown hominin related to Homo sapiens and other primate species."" (Mitochondrial DNA, or mtDNA, is the DNA that resides in the cell's energy-producing structures, and is typically passed down from mothers, while nuclear DNA, nuDNA, resides in the cells' nuclei and is passed down from both parents to offspring.)

""Our data indicate that the North American Sasquatch is a hybrid species, the result of males of an unknown hominin species crossing with female Homo sapiens,"" the statement reads. [Infographic: Tracking Belief in Bigfoot]

So where's the evidence? Well, there is none. Not yet, anyway: Ketchum's research has not appeared in any peer-reviewed scientific journal, and there's no indication when that might happen. If the data are good and the science is sound, any reputable science journal would jump at the chance to be the first to publish this groundbreaking information. Until then, Ketchum has refused to let anyone else see her evidence.

Of course the history of Bigfoot is rife with exaggerated and premature claims about proof of the creature's existence. For decades, various types of evidence have been offered as final, definitive proof, ranging from Bigfoot hair to blood to dead bodies. Without exception, the evidence has always been hoaxed, misidentification or inconclusive.

Because Ketchum has released no information at all about her findings (nor have they been examined by outside experts), it's impossible to evaluate the validity of her conclusions. But an important clue can be found in her statement that ""Sasquatch mtDNA is identical to modern Homo sapiens.""

If the mitochontrial DNA is identical to Homo sapiens (i.e., modern humans), then this suggests one of two options. The first, endorsed by Ketchum, is that Bigfoot ancestors had sex with women about 15,000 years ago and created a half-human hybrid species currently hiding across North America. [Rumor or Reality: The Creatures of Cryptozoology]

There is, however, another, simpler interpretation of such results: The samples were contaminated. Whatever the sample originally was — Bigfoot, bear, human or something else — it's possible that the people who collected and handled the specimens accidentally introduced their DNA into the sample, which can easily occur with something as innocent as a spit, sneeze or cough. No one outside of Ketchum's team knows how this alleged Bigfoot DNA was collected, from where or by whom. It could have been collected by the world's top forensics experts, or by a pair of amateur Bigfoot buffs with no evidence-gathering training.

How did the team definitively determine that the samples were from a Bigfoot? Did they take a blood or saliva sample from a living Bigfoot? If so, how did they get that close, and why didn't they simply capture it or photograph it? If the samples were found in the wild, how do they know it wasn't left by another animal — or possibly even a hunter, hiker or camper who left human genetic material?

Previous alleged Bigfoot samples subjected to DNA analysis have been deemed ""unknown"" or ""unidentified."" However, ""unknown"" or ""unidentified"" results do not mean ""Bigfoot."" There are many reasons why a DNA sample might come back unknown, including that it was contaminated or too degraded by environmental conditions. Or it could simply mean that the animal it came from was not among the reference samples that the laboratory used for comparison. There is no reference sample of Bigfoot DNA to compare it with, so by definition, there cannot be a conclusive match.

Ketchum also issued a statementrequesting that the U.S. government immediately recognize Bigfoot as ""an indigenous people and immediately protect their human and Constitutional rights against those who would see in their physical and cultural differences a 'license' to hunt, trap, or kill them."" Since no Bigfoot has ever been hunted, trapped or killed, it's not clear that the creatures — if they exist — require any special federal protection.

Ketchum's is not the only genetics-based project intended to find Bigfoot. Earlier this year, researchers from Oxford University and the Lausanne Museum of Zoology announced they were collecting samples of alleged Bigfoot and Yeti hair for genetic identification. Oxford geneticist Bryan Sykes collected materials from the public from May through September, and is currently conducting DNA analysis. Once the results are in, he plans to submit his results to a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

If Ketchum has the definitive proof she claims, the world will soon know about it, and Bigfoot will be proven once and for all. On the other hand, if the evidence never appears, or is inconclusive and flawed, the search will continue.

548,"Nelson: How About A Bailout For America’s Family Farms?

Country music icon says just $1 billion out of $700 billion could get real economy back on track

Country music icon Willie Nelson has a message for Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke in the wake of the recent $700 billion dollar plus Wall Street bailout – how about a bailout for the desperate and struggling family farmers of America that are nearing extinction?

“I have written a letter as president of Farm Aid to whoever controls that money that we would like to have $1 billion dollars from that 700….$1 billion dollars is I think all we’ll need to turn the economy around if we start out taking care of our family farmers,” Nelson told The Alex Jones Show.

“We could put 10 million farmers back on the land, making a living out there raising food and fuel….and that $1 billion dollars I think would go a long way to changing our negative attitudes that we have and the confidence in ourselves and in our country right now,” said Nelson, adding that all foreclosures on farms should be halted immediately.

“I think that if we invested that $1 billion with our family farmers, we would begin to turn it around,” stressed the country music star, later joking that $100 billion would be an even better amount.

Nelson has been a multi-decade activist and vocal proponent for Farm Aid, and recently performed alongside Neil Young at the highly successful 2008 Farm Aid concert which was held at the Comcast Center in Mansfield, MA, having helped organize the first Farm Aid concert in 1985.

Farm Aid is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to keep family farmers on their land and support locally sourced, humanely-raised and organic food in the face of a gargantuan attempt on behalf of big agribusiness to squeeze the family farmer out of existence.

The letter that Nelson and fellow Farm Aid directors John Mellencamp, Neil Young and Dave Matthews sent to Congress points out, “When farms thrive, Main Street businesses and local communities thrive. Far from Wall Street, family farmers are creating real wealth, producing real value, growing from seeds and sunlight a product that nourishes us both physically and economically. Supporting diverse decentralized family farming will do far more for the stability and vitality of our country than a handful of global agribusiness corporations could ever do.”

“The proposed $700 billion bailout asks taxpayers to foot the bill without giving them the opportunity to share in any gains. A $1 billion investment in family farm agriculture would enrich us all, because we are all shareholders of the family farm. The return on investment in the family farm includes thriving local economies, nutritious food for better health, a safer and more secure food supply, a cleaner environment and more renewable energy.”

Nelson pointed out that when 8-10 million family farmers were on the land in America at the end of the second world war the economy was strong because, “Agriculture is the bottom rung on the economic ladder,” adding that the farmers became a target because they were a political problem.

“Let’s put out the fire now, we’ll figure out who started it later and that’s pretty much what we have to do, we have to stop the fire and stop the bleeding, and I think the best way to do that is still from the ground up, go back to our family farmer, he’s the one that started taking care of us in the beginning so let’s let him do it again,” Nelson concluded.

78,"President Donald Trump has had one of the most successful first years in office of any president in the history of America.

I know this because White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said as much Tuesday: “I don’t think anyone can argue it’s probably one of the most successful first years in office.”

Since nobody can argue it, I’m not going to try. Besides, spending five minutes Googling the concrete factual evidence that would disprove that claim is a waste of five minutes that could be spent honoring the unrivaled greatness of our president.

Speaking of Trump’s greatness, did you know he has made it so nobody dies in commercial airline crashes anymore? On Tuesday, the president tweeted: “Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation. Good news — it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017, the best and safest year on record!”

That’s fantastic! What’s even more amazing is the report Trump is citing was for global air travel, meaning the many actions he did not take to increase commercial aviation safety in America also helped travelers in every other country in the world! And here in America, we went from zero commercial airline deaths in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to an even-more-impressive zero commercial airline deaths in 2017!

That’s what I call strong leadership. Speaking of which, did you know our supremely confident president has increased the size of America’s famously non-existent Nuclear Button, making it bigger than North Korea’s Nuclear Button?

Well, he has. Late Tuesday, Trump sent the following trouser-soiling tweet: “North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the ‘Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.’ Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!”

WOO-HOOO! At long last, we have an extremely secure and manly president unafraid to boast about the great size and power of our national desk-mounted nuke button, which I’m sure is really a thing despite no credible evidence to suggest it exists.

Of course the president hasn’t tweeted about all his accomplishments. He’s far too humble and fantastic, and also too busy accomplishing more than any president in history.

But you can easily identify the many things you should be thanking President Trump for by applying this simple two-part rule:

1) If it happened any time after Inauguration Day 2017 and it was good, President Trump is responsible for it.

2) On the off chance it’s something not good, President Trump is responsible for it only if it can be framed in a way that makes it seem good.

For example, the Chicago area had its coldest New Year’s Day high temperature on record and by Saturday the city will likely tie a decades-old record for consecutive days below 20 degrees.

Donald Trump is clearly responsible for these wonderfully cold temperatures and for helping Chicago break records! You never saw cold-weather records broken under President Barack Obama, and if Crooked Hillary Clinton had been elected, it would likely be 80 degrees and sunny in Chicago right now.

Trump’s conviction that global warming is a hoax has forced temperatures to drop, giving Chicagoans the enviable status of “record breakers.”

Another important improvement over past administrations: The total number of verified Bigfoot-related deaths in 2017 fell to zero, a comforting and substantial improvement over the less-impressive zero Bigfoot-related deaths that occurred during all other American presidents’ first years.

So what do we have after only one short year of the single greatest presidential administration in the history of presidential greatness? We have, inarguably, the most successful first year in office, with Zero deaths from plane crashes and a Nuclear Button so big it could in no way be interpreted as an overcompensation for something tragically small. We have Chicago being made great again with record-breaking cold weather and a precipitous drop in the number of people killed by Sasquatch.

We have a booming economy, with the S&P 500 up an unprecedented and certainly record-breaking 18 percent in Trump’s first 11 month’s in office, compared with the S&P 500 going up a mere 36.9 percent during Obama’s first 11 months. (Any suggestion that 36.9 is a larger number than 18 is FAKE NEWS.)

The bottom line is this: I don’t think anyone can argue with how well everything is going in America.

Have you noticed how every American who is alive is breathing? I imagine we’ll soon see a Trump tweet celebrating this fantastic news: “Since taking office I have been very strict on human beings breathing. Good news — it was just reported that all living human beings were breathing in 2017. I am amazing and this is all thanks to me! #MAGA.”

1186,"Recent systematic reviews have highlighted the lack of quality information with respect to the epidemiology of equine laminitis, including data on prevalence, inciting causes and risk factors (Wylie et al 2011a,b). The reported disease frequency has ranged from 1.5% to 34% in different studies, with factors such as sample size and type (e.g. ponies vs. horses), underlying laminitis etiology, case definition, modes of diagnosis, climate, and feeding/management practices likely contributing to this wide variation in frequency of laminitis (Wylie et al. 20011a). Hinckley and Henderson (1996) surveyed veterinarians and horse owners to estimate the number of acute and chronic laminitis cases in a population of approximately 113 000 horses and reported about 1700 cases of both acute and chronic laminitis with an overall prevalence of 3%. Approximately 61% of the laminitis cases occurred in horses kept at pasture (Hinckley & Henderson 1996). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) survey reported that 13% of horse operations had had at least one case of laminitis during the previous 12 months with 1% of horses affected at any one time (based on owner responses). Laminitis was identified as the most common cause of foot lameness, accounting for up to 16% of all lameness cases. Additionally, nutritionally-associated laminitis accounted for more than 50% of the cases, with 46% attributed to pasture grazing and 7% to grain overload (Kane et al 2000, USDA 2000).

A retrospective study in the south of England reported the prevalence, incidence and seasonality of laminitis in a population of about 1000 horses/ponies kept on a single farm and maintained at pasture (Menzies-Gow et al 2010a). Over a 6-year period, 23.5% of the population had at least one episode of veterinary diagnosed laminitis; the highest prevalence (2.6%) and incidence (16 cases/1000 animals) of laminitis occurred in May. A positive association was found between hours of sunshine and the prevalence and incidence of laminitis, but there were no associations with rainfall or monthly temperature. The association between hours of sunshine and incident laminitis was presumed to reflect altered nutritional intake (i.e., increased consumption of nonstructural carbohydrates during periods of bright sunshine that promote plant photosynthesis and carbohydrate accumulation) rather than the direct effect of exposure of horses to sunlight. Other studies have reported an increased risk of laminitis during the spring and summer months (Dorn et al 1975, Hinckley & Henderson 1996, USDA 2000) although evidence of seasonality is inconsistent (Polzer & Slater 1997, Wyllie et al 2011b).

Menzies-Gow et al (2010a) also observed that approximately one-third of animals diagnosed with laminitis had at least one more episode during the study period. Moreover, about 24% of these animals had a repeated episode in the same year as the original diagnosis. These observations confirm the clinical impression that some animals are prone to repeated episodes of laminitis (Buckley et al 2007) and focus attention on the possibility that there are phenotypic or genetic factors associated with susceptibility. With regards to genetic factors, laminitis in a foal attributable to disruption of a single molecule of the hemidesmosome adhesion complex was believed to be the result of an inherited recessive defect that lead to failure in expression of the protein plectin (French & Pollitt 2004). Additionally, Belgian foals with mechanobullous disease (epidermolysis bullosa) are at an increased risk of laminitis (Frame et al 1988).

In the study by Menzies-Gow et al (2010a), univariate analysis revealed that animals ≥14.3 hands in height were at reduced risk of laminitis while females, light animals (<400 kg) and animals with a weight-to-height ratio <7.51 kg/in were at higher risk. Female gender also was a significant risk factor in multivariate analysis, a finding in agreement with several other studies (Dorn et al 1975, Alford et al 2001, Slater et al 1995). The reason for the apparent increased laminitis risk in mares is not known. The height and weight associations with laminitis lend support to the clinical impression that ponies are at higher risk as compared to horses, although in multivariate analysis weight but not height was revealed as a significant risk factor (Menzies-Gow et al 2010a). In a prospective study of pasture-associated laminitis, the majority of affected animals (89 of 107 cases) were overweight/obese (Menzies-Gow et al 2010b). Additionally, overweight animals were at increased risk of severe clinical signs and were less likely to survive. These findings are consistent with earlier reports that identified obesity as a risk factor for laminitis (Alford et al 2001). Increased load bearing by the feet is one potential explanation for the increased risk of laminitis in overweight/obese animals.

Several studies have characterized metabolic risk factors for pasture-associated laminitis in ponies (Treiber et al 2005, 2006, Bailey et al 2007, 2008, Carter et al 2009). In an inbred herd of Welsh and Dartmoor ponies, laminitis risk was associated with the clustering of hyperinsulinemia, obesity and hypertriglyceridemia – this phenotype was termed “prelaminitic metabolic syndrome (PLMS)” (Treiber et al 2006). The PLMS criteria predicted 11 of 13 cases of clinical laminitis observed in May of the same year, with an odds ratio of 10.4 (i.e. ponies with this phenotype were at approximately 10-times higher risk for laminitis). Pedigree analysis suggested a dominant mode of inheritance of the PLMS phenotype, supporting the possibility of a genetic basis for laminitis predisposition (Treiber et al 2006). A subsequent study of this pony population demonstrated that the presence of obesity (generalized or regional, i.e., cresty neck), hyperinsulinemia (insulin >32 mU/l when sampled on winter pasture) or hyperleptinemia (>7.3 ng/ml) were useful predictors of laminitis episodes when ponies were exposed to high carbohydrate pasture (Carter et al 2009). A study of out-bred ponies in the UK also revealed an association between apparent insulin resistance (IR) and predisposition to pasture laminitis, and provided evidence of hypertension in the high risk ponies (Bailey et al 2008). Interestingly, expression of this metabolic phenotype was only noted in summer but not winter, suggesting interaction with environmental factors such as consumption of summer pasture forage (Bailey et al 2008). As mentioned, EMS rather than PLMS has been broadly adopted to describe horses and ponies with an insulin resistant phenotype and associated predisposition to laminitis. These animals are often overweight or obese (or have localized large fat deposits, e.g., a “cresty neck”) and exhibit abnormal insulin dynamics, either resting hyperinsulinemia or an exaggerated increase in insulin concentration in response to oral or intravenous glucose challenges (Frank et al 2010, Frank 2011). In addition to pony breeds, Morgan Horses, domesticated Spanish mustangs, European warmbloods and American saddlebreds are thought to be at increased risk for development of EMS; however, currently there is insufficient evidence to support or refute this belief. It should be emphasized that non-obese animals that may or may not show IR also can experience recurrent laminitis.",mainstream,M0afeb,big.foot

• Four states account for more than half of all TB cases: California, Texas, New York and Florida.

By the 1960s, tuberculosis (TB) had been almost totally eradicated in the United States. But 50 years later, according to a March 20 Reuters article, “Half a million people fell sick with dangerous superbug strains of TB in 2012, but fewer than one in four were diagnosed.” The World Health Organization has called drug-resistant tuberculosis (DRTB) a “public health crisis,” predicting that worldwide two million people may be infected by next year. If TB was on the outs, why is it coming back now in more virulent strains?

The culprit? A massive unregulated flow of lawbreakers crossing our southern border from Mexico and Latin America has led to a resurgence of fatal airborne diseases like TB that attack the lungs.

Cities in the U.S. such as Los Angeles and Jacksonville, Florida have seen dramatic rises in TB. The situation has become so dire that in the City of Angels, police officers are now advised to wear surgical masks when dealing with illegal aliens.

On March 20, this reporter contacted Salina Smith, a spokesperson for the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to inquire as to why TB is again plaguing our shores.

“Despite declines among other demographics, DRTB has taken a heavy toll in the U.S. along racial and ethnic lines, not to mention the homeless and those infected with HIV,” said Ms. Smith. “Geographically, four states account for more than half of all TB cases: California, Texas, New York and Florida.”

Continuing with specifics, Ms. Smith stated: “Hispanics and blacks have rates seven-times higher than whites, whereas Asians now exhibit TB rates 26-times higher than whites. Overall, foreign-born residents are 13-times more likely to have TB than are U.S.-born citizens.”

Considering that working-class taxpayers will be forced to foot the bill for illegals and foreign-born patients, Ms. Smith was asked about the costs for medicating patients with TB.

“Treating typical TB comes in at $17,000, while costs associated with DRTB rise to $134,000,” she said. “In cases of extreme DRTB, we’re looking at $430,000 in hospital fees.”

On March 20, this reporter also interviewed legendary author, activist and founder of the conservative-oriented Eagle Forum, Phyllis Schlafly. Having herself written on this subject, Mrs. Schlafly told this newspaper: “It’s outrageous what’s happening at our southern border. Why isn’t this administration keeping diseased people out? It used to be the rule at Ellis Island that if someone wasn’t healthy, they were sent back home.”

When questioned about this administration’s open-border policy, Mrs. Schlafly replied: “Obama doesn’t pay attention to the law. The American people overwhelmingly want our borders secured, but I genuinely think Obama wants to destroy this nation.”

Mrs. Schlafly added: “Just imagine how many innocent people on the streets and in hospitals are being infected by illegal immigrants. Letting illegals into this country is one of Obama’s highest priorities. It’s shocking.”

Lastly, on March 20, this reporter also reached out to Sandra Murillo, press officer for Doctors Without Borders. Voicing an undeniable urgency, Ms. Murillo explained: “We’re calling for immediate action to stop DRTB. This means doctors, pharmaceutical companies and researchers.”

Unfortunately, the Obama administration’s refusal to enforce immigration laws while advocating amnesty for upwards of 20 million illegal aliens—many afflicted with bacterial infections—will only cause TB rates among these populations to skyrocket.

1220,"To achieve hotspot ignition, inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions must achieve high hotspot internal energy that is inertially confined by a dense shell of DT fuel. To accomplish this, implosions are designed to achieve high peak implosion velocity, good energy coupling between the hotspot and imploding shell, and high areal-density at stagnation. However, experiments have shown that achieving these simultaneously is extremely challenging, partly because of inherent tradeoffs between these three interrelated requirements. The Bigfoot approach is to intentionally trade off high convergence, and therefore areal-density, in favor of high implosion velocity and good coupling between the hotspot and shell. This is done by intentionally colliding the shocks in the DT ice layer. This results in a short laser pulse which improves hohlraum symmetry and predictability while the reduced compression improves hydrodynamic stability. The results of this campaign will be reviewed and include demonstrated low-mode symmetry control at two different hohlraum geometries (5.75 mm and 5.4 mm diameters) and at two different target scales (5.4 mm and 6.0 mm hohlraum diameters) spanning 300-430 TW in laser power and 0.8-1.7 MJ in laser energy. Results of the 10% scaling between these designs for the hohlraum and capsule will be presented. Hydrodynamic instability growth from engineering features like the capsule fill tube are currently thought to be a significant perturbation to the target performance and a major factor in reducing its performance compared to calculations. Evidence supporting this hypothesis as well as plans going forward will be presented. Ongoing experiments are attempting to measure the impact on target performance from increase in target scale, and the preliminary results will also be discussed.

429,"Enter the measurement of the archival materials. Write a simple statement that gives the number of measurement units followed by the units of measure used. Do not use full sentences. If the extent is an estimation, the statement can be preceded by language to indicate that the measurement is estimated. If a number is longer than three digits, use commas. For example, a number should be written out as 12,877 instead of 12877. Two-dimensional Materials

 For two-dimensional materials (paper, photographs, maps, etc.) express the extent either as a linear measure or as a page or item count. (A linear measurement expresses length; a cubic measurement expresses volume, which is length times width times height.) Linear Measure

 When indicating a linear measure, use the terms ""linear feet"" and ""linear inches.""
• If a foot or more, enter the feet and inches to the nearest inch.
• If less than one foot, enter the linear inches to the nearest inch.
• If less than one inch, enter decimal fractions of an inch to the nearest .1 inch, but not less than .1 inch.
• If less than .1 inch, enter the term ""Negligible"" or indicate the item or page count. How to Measure

 Determine the linear measurement as follows.
• In general

 Measure the material in the direction a user would look through it - perpendicular to the face of the document.
• Boxed records

 If the records are in a box, measure them by the way they run in the box. For example: If the records are tri-folded and standing up, the measurement would be up to 12 inches in a letter size box. If the records are unfolded and filed vertically, the measurement would be up to 5 inches in a letter or legal size box. If the records completely fill their containers, it is possible to use the container measurements as a convenience to calculate extent for large series. When multiplying container width to determine linear measure, use the width of the box as stated in the Holdings Measurement Type Authority List. For example, for LTA-S and LGA-S boxes, multiply the number of boxes by 5 1/4 inches. If multiplying by the length of the box (for example, for tri-folded paper filed from front to back), use the length as stated in the Holdings Measurement Type Authority List.
• Cards 

 If measuring cards, measure them by the way the cards run in the box.
• Bound records

 If the records are bound volumes, measure the widths of the spines.
• Rolled maps, plans, etc. 

 If the records are rolled maps, plans, blueprints, or posters, flatten the material and measure the thickness. (An estimate will suffice if the materials are too fragile to be rolled out and flattened.) Page or Item Count

 When indicating a page count, use the term ""pages."" If necessary, the page count may be estimated. If the archival materials are comprised of various media types, distinguish each type to make the extent measurement as accurate as possible. Three-dimensional Materials 

 For three-dimensional materials, indicate the number of items and the media type (reels, rolls, cassettes, artifacts, etc.). The length of film on rolls or reels is entered in Footage or Total Footage. If needed to clarify the amount of archival material, indicate both the intellectual count and the physical count. Data Files

 For electronic records, indicate the number of data files or type of logical data records. A logical data record is a set of data processed as a unit by a computer system or application independently of its physical environment. Examples of a logical data record include a word processing document, an e-mail message, each row in each table of a relational database, each row in an independent logical file database. Accuracy and Precision

 Be as accurate and precise as possible. Do not say ""1,000 photographs, 1 linear foot,"" which implies there are photographs and some other materials, when the actual amount is ""1 linear foot comprised of 1,000 photographs."" Say ""2,000 maps"" instead of ""2,000 items."" The extent may be estimated if necessary.",mainstream,M0c10a,big.foot

602,"What are the treatment options?

Because molluscum contagiosum is self-limited in healthy individuals, treatment may be unnecessary. Nonetheless, issues such as lesion visibility, underlying atopic disease, and the desire to prevent transmission may prompt therapy.

Treatment for molluscum is usually recommended if lesions are in the genital area (on or near the penis, vulva, vagina, or anus). If lesions are found in this area it is a good idea to visit your healthcare provider as there is a possibility that you may have another disease spread by sexual contact.

Be aware that some treatments available through the internet may not be effective and may even be harmful.

Physical removal of lesions may include cryotherapy (freezing the lesion with liquid nitrogen), curettage (the piercing of the core and scraping of caseous or cheesy material), and laser therapy. These options are rapid and require a trained health care provider, may require local anesthesia, and can result in post-procedural pain, irritation, and scarring.

It is not a good idea to try and remove lesions or the fluid inside of lesions yourself. By removing lesions or lesion fluid by yourself you may unintentionally autoinoculate other parts of the body or risk spreading it to others. By scratching or scraping the skin you could cause a bacterial infection.

Gradual removal of lesions may be achieved by oral therapy. This technique is often desirable for pediatric patients because it is generally less painful and may be performed by parents at home in a less threatening environment. Oral cimetidine has been used as an alternative treatment for small children who are either afraid of the pain associated with cryotherapy, curettage, and laser therapy or because the possibility of scarring is to be avoided. While cimetidine is safe, painless, and well tolerated, facial mollusca do not respond as well as lesions elsewhere on the body.

Podophyllotoxin cream (0.5%) is reliable as a home therapy for men but is not recommended for pregnant women because of presumed toxicity to the fetus. Each lesion must be treated individually as the therapeutic effect is localized. Other options for topical therapy include iodine and salicylic acid, potassium hydroxide, tretinoin, cantharidin (a blistering agent usually applied in an office setting), and imiquimod (T cell modifier). Imiquimod has not been proven effective for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum in children and is not recommended for children due to possible adverse events. These treatments must be prescribed by a health care professional.

Most therapies are effective in immunocompetent patients; however, patients with HIV/AIDS or other immunosuppressing conditions often do not respond to traditional treatments. In addition, these treatments are largely ineffective in achieving long-term control in HIV patients.

Low CD4 cell counts have been linked to widespread facial mollusca and therefore have become a marker for severe HIV disease. Thus far, therapies targeted at boosting the immune system have proven the most effective therapy for molluscum contagiosum in immunocompromised persons. In extreme cases, intralesional interferon has been used to treat facial lesions in these patients. However, the severe and unpleasant side effects of interferon, such as influenza-like symptoms, site tenderness, depression, and lethargy, make it a less-than-desirable treatment. Furthermore, interferon therapy proved most effective in otherwise healthy persons. Radiation therapy is also of little benefit.",mainstream,M0fa28,big.foot
634,"So far, Gilead Sciences' Kite Pharma has been buying from contractors the viral vector material needed for its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) treatment Yescarta. But with an expanding pipeline of cell therapies, the company says it is time to be able to produce its own.

The drugmaker announced today that it will build a 67,000-square-foot facility at its Oceanside, California, biologics site just for developing viral vectors, the tools needed to deliver genetic material into cells. The company declined to disclose what it expects to invest in the facility or how many people it may employ but said it is slated to begin commercial manufacturing of viral vectors in the second half of 2021.

“Viral vectors are one of the key components in cell therapy production, however, the industry’s current development and manufacturing capabilities are not widely established and supply is limited,” Tim Moore, executive vice president of technical operations for Kite, said in a statement.

“By pursuing our own viral vector facility, we will be able to advance viral vector development and supply to allow for accelerated process development of current CAR T and future pipeline therapies, while continuing to partner with external suppliers,” Moore explained.

Gilead swept up Kite and Yescarta in a $12 billion deal in 2017. Approved for treating some patients with large B-cell lymphoma, Gilead has had trouble getting Yescarta established in the market. It generated $264 million last year but has trailed Novartis' Kymriah, which won the first-ever cell therapy approval.

Still, Gilead is planning for a big future in cell therapies and has aggressively expanded its manufacturing capabilities to stay ahead of the curve.

In April, it announced it was building a 279,000-square-foot facility west of Baltimore in Frederick County, Maryland, to manufacture its next-gen oncology treatments including Yescarta and its prospective T-cell receptor therapies. The site will employ up to 800 workers.

The big biotech also is building a separate CAR-T manufacturing facility near an Amsterdam airport, a move that is designed to shorten shipping times in Europe for the sensitive product. It also acquired a new building in Santa Monica, California, from Astellas Pharma that it will use for clinical manufacturing and cell therapy R&D.

In addition, Gilead is muscling up its executive infrastructure to make its big move into the new market. Last week, it announced it will bring on Eli Lilly executive Christi Shaw to run Kite and move the effort forward, and last year the company nabbed Michael Amoroso from Eisai to be its SVP and head of worldwide commercial efforts in cell therapy. He oversees sales and marketing, doctor and patient services and “market access”—aka payer negotiations.

While Gilead has touted Kite's cell therapy pipeline, it has had troubles there as well.

1040,"Most observers would agree that the United States has directly or indirectly contributed to the creation of most of the international terrorist groups that have been in the news for the past thirty years. The narrative of how Osama bin Laden and what was to become al-Qaeda were initially supported by the U.S., Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to drive the Red Army out of Afghanistan is well known. Washington did so with little regard for broader agendas, including removing the United States out of the Middle East and regime changing the existing secular and religious Arab states in the region.

When the American supported Holy Warrior Mujahidin were successful beyond their dreams and succeeded in forcing the Soviets to withdraw during 1998-9, a weak Moscow-supported Mohammad Najibullah regime stayed in power, only to be defeated in 1992 by the Taliban, who were one component of the Islamist groups that were being supported by the U.S. and its partners. The Taliban soon demonstrated that they too were not willing to be tools of either Islamabad or Washington and eventually provided al-Qaeda and bin Laden with a home, the casus belli that led to the U.S. attack on Afghanistan after 9/11.

The U.S. occupation of Iraq followed, based on a similar pretext, i.e. that Saddam Hussein was in league with terrorists and was preparing weapons of mass destruction that threatened the United States. The deliberate dismantling of Iraqi government mechanisms coupled with a collapse in its civil society resulting in extreme sectarianism led many Sunni Iraqis to join the next emerging terrorist group, the Islamic State (IS), also called the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or Daesh. IS was as surely the product of the American interventionist tactics in Iraq as were al-Qaeda and the Taliban earlier in Afghanistan.

IS’s appeal was largely due to its recreation of a territorial state, which it dubbed the new Caliphate. It is now facing final defeat at its last remaining enclaves in Iraq and Syria. Soon, it will only be a dark memory in those two countries, a legacy of ruined cities, mass executions, cultural vandalism and torture.

It is not known if the Islamic State’s leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is still alive, but the group, which proved to be particularly astute in its handling of internet generated propaganda, will certainly live on through radical websites and to an extent through its foreign supporters returning to their home countries to carry out terrorist acts. There were also be places in Africa and Asia where IS will continue to have a physical presence on the ground, to include Sinai and Libya. But, generally speaking, the group will cease to exist, even though one can anticipate that there will be successor organizations that will benefit from the IS example and follow a similar pattern to attract recruits.

What has changed, however, is the manner in which IS was defeated. The United States helped create al-Qaeda and the Taliban and then played a major role in attempting to destroy them after they ceased to be useful. Washington did indeed play a part in the fighting against IS but it was generally in support of others like the Iraqi Army or Kurdish militias and it did not get seriously engaged due to misgivings about previous interventions and incompatible demands for regime change in Damascus. So IS was defeated by a coalition of Muslim states supported by limited but effective Russian air and sea power, not by some arrangement cobbled together by the United States. Now, the United States, which has lost what little leverage it had to participate at the head table in any discussions to come to a final settlement of the Syrian crisis is desperately seeking to remain relevant by leaving its troops in the area and operating through surrogates.

But the big loser in the defeat of IS will likely be Israel. The Netanyahu government, whose overall strategy has been to weaken all of its neighbors by bringing about their fragmentation along sectarian and tribal lines, has assisted both IS and al-Qaeda fighters in Syria against that country’s legitimate government and has repeatedly attacked Syrian Army forces. It has been actively supporting Kurdish separatism in Iraq while urging the United States to attack Iran and is now colluding with Saudi Arabia to use both military and economic force to compel the Lebanese government to remove the political arm of Hezbollah from the country’s government and to disarm the group. This has created a crescent of battle-tested governments running from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean – Libya, Syria, Iraq and Iran - which now have particularly good reasons to hate the Israelis and their meddling in the region.

It would be overreach to suggest that the four governments in question will act in unison against Israel because each has particular national interests that will drive its policies, but they certainly will not make any effort to be accommodating to either Israel or to the United States. The four nations are united by the experience of their war against IS, by their largely Shi’a populations, and by their appreciation of the Iranian effort that contributed so greatly to their successes on the battlefield.

Once again, the United States has intervened in a conflict in the Middle East that was none of its business and, regarding which, no genuine interests were involved. And behind the scenes, Israel was encouraging the unrest for its own reasons. Washington can again walk away from the mess that it has created, but will it? Recent comments from Secretary of Defense James Mattis and from Nikki Haley at the U.N. that the U.S. will keep troops in Syria and will ""fight for justice"" would suggest that the adults have again left the room. But someday the United States will either have a reality check or run out of manpower and money and will go.

The Dark Secret Behind a British Billionaire’s “Parallel State” In Argentina’s Patagonia

A sinister plan involving the world’s most notorious oligarchs, as well as the IMF and key elements of the global Zionist lobby, lurks beneath the de facto independent state created by one of England’s richest men in the heart of Argentina’s Patagonia.

EL BOLSÓN, ARGENTINA – At the “end of the world,” spanning the southernmost regions of Argentina and Chile, lies the land of Patagonia, much of which remains a pristine wilderness that has inspired countless naturalists and would-be adventurers with its dramatic landscapes and natural beauty. For many, it is a place that still feels remarkably untouched and removed from the chaos of the modern world.

Yet, it is these very qualities, as well as the region’s great oil and gas potential and its abundance of glacier-fed freshwater reserves, that have placed it in the crosshairs of predators — predators armed with billions of dollars, powerful influence over Argentine politics and the country’s press, as well as alliances with controversial international financial organizations and key elements of the global Zionist lobby.

Coveted for its still largely unplundered resources, Patagonia has become the target of a close-knit network of notorious billionaires and global elites, who have spent much of the last two and a half decades seeking to transform this area into their own independent state.

Indeed, though several of these billionaires have already created de facto private states where they enjoy near-total impunity within Argentine Patagonia, others have been behind major efforts that have pushed for the territory’s secession. Still others have pushed Argentina’s government to exchange its claim to Patagonia for “debt relief” as a way of easing Argentina’s economic plight that, incidentally, was largely created by this very same group of billionaires. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), whose connections to this billionaire network are considerable, has had an outsized role in this effort.

Yet this appears to be more than just a venture on the behalf of notable oligarchs and the global elite, as prominent elements of the international Zionist lobby are intimately involved, as is the state of Israel, though the extent of the involvement of the latter is subject to debate. Their interest revolves around claims that date back to the founding of Zionism in the 19th century, when revered Zionist figures like Theodore Herzl discussed Argentina as a potential homeland for a Jewish ethno-state.

Since then, other notable Zionists, including past Israeli ambassadors to Argentina, have argued that Israel is for “European Jews” while “American Jews” must take Argentina for themselves. Notably, the method suggested by Herzl as a means of creating a Zionist state in his seminal work “The Jewish State” involves the exchange of debt for territory.

In the first part of this investigative series, MintPress explores the de facto independent state that has been created by British billionaire and Zionist Joe Lewis, a long-time associate of controversial Hungarian-American financier George Soros. Lewis has essentially bought out the local, regional and even national government of Argentina, allowing him to operate with impunity while he acquires more and more territory through land purchases of dubious (if any) legality, intimidates and threatens locals, usurps crucial water and energy resources from local towns, and operates his own international private airport that no one but he controls.

Subsequent reports in this series will examine the other key players in this effort to create a Patagonian state, namely Argentine oligarchs Marcelo Mindlin and Eduardo Elsztain, who are both deeply connected to the global Zionist lobby and the Rockefeller-founded Americas Society, and are also both close Soros associates. Finally, the role of these individuals and their associates in efforts to use IMF debt slavery to pressure the Argentine government to swap debt for territory will be revealed, as will the role of the Zionist lobby and prominent figures in the global elite.

The quaint mountain town of El Bolsón, nestled among the picturesque rocky peaks of Argentina’s Patagonia and famed for its local legends of gnomes and elves, may seem an unlikely epicenter in a nationwide battle that has pitted locals against powerful foreign billionaires — billionaires who are not only plundering the country’s rich resources but eroding its national sovereignty through backdoor deals with Argentina’s most powerful, and most corrupt, political leaders.

Yet, however unlikely the role of this sleepy town in Argentina’s Río Negro province may seem, for over a decade many locals have used every tool at their disposal to oppose one billionaire’s effort to turn the town and much of Río Negro into his own personal fiefdom. This struggle has seen massive demonstrations in El Bolsón against British billionaire Joe Lewis, with some attracting as many as 15,000 participants – nearly 80 percent of the town’s entire population.

Lewis, worth an estimated $5.2 billion according Forbes, is best known in the West for owning the British Tottenham Hotspur football club, his sprawling luxury estates and golf resorts in the Bahamas and Florida, and owning well-known brands including Puma sportswear and Vans shoes. He is often described as a “self-made” billionaire, having been born to a poor Jewish family in London, who worked his way up to become one of England’s richest men.

Since the mid-1990s, Lewis has been building an empire in Patagonia, having become the owner of extensive properties north of El Bolsón — which, among other things, contain almost all of the town’s water reserves, as well as those of the nearby farming community, Mallín Ahogado — and the de facto power behind Pampa Energía, the company controlling most of Argentina’s electricity production. Part Two of this series will focus on Lewis’ role at Pampa Energía, as well as that of his associate, Marcelo Mindlin.

Long before his venture into Argentina, Lewis was a controversial figure owing to his close association with controversial Hungarian-American financier George Soros. Indeed, the bulk of Lewis’ massive fortune derives from his decision to “team up” with Soros to bet against the British pound in 1992, a day popularly known as Black Wednesday.

Soros’ and Lewis’ bet against the pound actually led to the pound crashing, after Soros ordered his hedge fund to “go for the jugular” and aggressively trade against the currency, thereby prompting its sharp devaluation. Though Soros is often called “the man who broke the Bank of England” as a result of the $1 billion in profits he made on that fateful day, Lewis is said to have made an even larger profit than Soros, according to several reports.

While Soros became a financial celebrity after Black Wednesday, Lewis opted to stay out of the limelight even though, just three years later, he would repeat what he helped do to the British pound with the Mexican peso, reaping yet another massive profit. While the Mexican peso crisis made Lewis even wealthier, it led to a massive jump in poverty, unemployment and inequality in Mexico and left its government beholden to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) through a loan package arranged by then-U.S. President Bill Clinton.

Between 1995 and 1996, the severe economic recession that followed the Mexican peso crisis spread throughout the Americas and “severely affected” the economies of other Latin American countries like Argentina. As fresh economic havoc arrived and took hold in Argentina, Lewis decided to take advantage of the troubled regional economic climate that he himself had helped create and began developing his interests in Patagonia.

As will be explored later in this investigative series, Soros and two of his Argentine associates who are also connected to Lewis — Eduardo Elsztain and Marcelo Mindlin — took advantage of this economic crisis and subsequent crises to buy major stakes in several banks as well as massive tracts of Argentine real estate, particularly in Patagonia.

How to build an empire

In 1996, Joe Lewis returned to Argentina after initially visiting the country in 1992 at the invitation of Australian media tycoon Kerry Packer. Lewis, apparently inspired by his first visit, had decided to buy property in the area. According to regional media outlet El Patagónico, Lewis’ dream was not just owning his piece of paradise, but creating “his own state in Patagonia.”

Lewis soon came into contact with Nicolás Van Ditmar, who would not only facilitate Lewis’ initial and subsequent land purchases in Argentina’s Patagonia but would also do so for several other foreign oligarchs. Van Ditmar had previously arranged massive land sales farther south to the Benetton Group, the family company run by the Italian oligarchs of the same name, best known as the owners of the United Colors of Benetton clothing company.

Van Ditmar, after learning of what Lewis hoped to acquire, spoke to him of the property of the Montero family, which encircled a pristine mountain lake known as Lago Escondido (Hidden Lake). Most of the members of the Montero family agreed to sell their collective property of around 14,000 hectares (~34,549 acres) to Lewis for $7 million. However, one of the Montero brothers, Irineo Montero, had refused and he, along with his wife María Ortiz and their employee José Matamala, were all found dead under mysterious circumstances.

Whether or not Lewis or his “right hand man” Van Ditmar were somehow involved in Irineo’s death and those of his wife and employee, there is no denying that their mysterious yet grisly endings cleared the way for Lewis’ purchase of Lago Escondido and the surrounding area. However, Lewis’ acquisition of this property, irrespective of the remaining Montero siblings’ willingness to sell, should never have been allowed for several reasons.

First, as per Argentine law, the sale of the property that Lewis has owned since 1996 is prohibited to a foreign citizen on national security grounds, given that the property is just 20 km from the Chilean border and thus, in foreign hands, could represent a grave national security risk. Second, it violates a local law dating back to 1969 that caps the maximum amount of land that any individual – Argentine citizen or foreigner – may own at around 70 hectares (~172 acres).

Third, it violates a provincial law passed in 1994 that created a protected natural area called the Río Azul Lago Escondido Natural Protected Area (ANPRALE), which included a significant portion of the land that Lewis would later buy from the Monteros. However, that law was amended in 1998, a few years after Lewis’ purchase, to remove the portion of his land that had previously been named a protected area under the control of the state. Federico Soria noted that the way in which the 1994 law was amended was blatantly unconstitutional.

One would think that the law would have prevented Lewis’ acquisition of the land long before Van Ditmar had first approached the Monteros about Lewis’ interest in the land. However, he was explicitly allowed to do so, despite the illegal nature of the purchase, owing to the general laxity of the local, regional and federal authorities towards wealthy foreigners looking to acquire Argentine land. As Lewis himself said in an interview with Gonzalo Sanchez in 2004, “I bought what they let me buy and here we are.”

The two-term presidency of Carlos Menem in the 1990s marked the reversal of more than 50 years of keeping and protecting areas of national importance and deemed strategic to natural security by permitting foreigners to buy a larger percentage of land than had been allowed since the passage of a 1944 law intended to preserve the territorial integrity of Argentina. Notably, when that law was created, the government of Edelmiro Farrell and Juan Perón expropriated several strategic properties owned by foreigners.

Yet, Menem’s presidency — which was thoroughly aligned with the “Washington consensus” — began, according to critics, violating the spirit of this 1944 law by issuing approvals of several million hectares to foreigners. Menem’s policies favoring foreign land purchases in rural areas have since been expanded by the presidency of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner as well as that of the current president of Argentina, Mauricio Macri. Both of them have used Lewis’ private helicopter and Macri is a regular visitor of Lewis’ lakeside property in Patagonia.

Locals in El Bolsón have claimed that Lewis’ purchase of the Lago Escondido property – despite the legal obstacles – was the direct result of Menem’s policies. A member of El Bolsón’s community radio station FM Alas, who chose to remain anonymous owing to his father’s personal involvement in Lewis’ regional businesses, told MintPress that Lewis “had negotiated the purchase of the [Lago Escondido] property in meetings at the Casa Rosada [Pink House],” the Argentine equivalent of the White House, during Menem’s presidency.

MintPress was unable to confirm whether Lewis or his associates had visited the Casa Rosada while negotiating the property’s purchase. Yet Lewis has stated in interviews that “Menem sent us greetings and his best wishes when we opened [Lewis’ Lago Escondido mansion]” (Sanchez interview, pg. 61). Furthermore, Lewis has a notable habit of building close relationships with powerful Argentine politicians, including Macri. Macri has called Lewis “a friend,” defended him repeatedly, and even personally vacationed at Lewis’ Lago Escondido property.

Ever since his arrival to the area caused concern among some locals, Lewis has sought to win the good graces of the people of El Bolsón by acting as their benefactor — donating hospitals, building soccer fields and hosting annual activities and sporting competitions for locals at his property. This altruism is either embraced or rejected by locals, depending on whom you talk to. In keeping with the image that he has sought to cultivate among the townspeople, Lewis is often referred to as “Uncle Joe,” though it is spoken with either respect and admiration or derision and disgust.

Felicitas Libano, a member of the Assembly for the Defense of Water and Land (ADAT), told MintPress that Lewis has “integrated himself into nearly all the function of the city,” including its firefighters, police and other areas of the municipal government, and has “always tried to position himself as a benefactor.” According to Guido Augello, a member of local community radio station FM Alas, the townspeople are divided somewhat evenly into “people that like ‘Uncle Joe,’ people who hate him and people who don’t care.”

Lewis has also won over a portion of the townspeople and local businessmen through his patronage of select local services and his occasional hosting of small groups of locals for invitation-only sporting events and holiday celebrations. However, some have contended that Lewis receives many foreign guests, particularly from Israel.

According to the research of former French intelligence officer turned journalist Thierry Meyssan, Lewis has been inviting thousands of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers to his territory annually. In late 2017, Meyssan alleged:

Since the Falklands War, the Israeli army has been organizing ‘holiday camps’ in Patagonia for its soldiers. Between 8,000 and 10,000 of them now come every year to spend two weeks on Joe Lewis’ land.”

It is unclear if Meyssan’s information was the result of his time in France’s exterior intelligence service DGSE or independent research he conducted since becoming a journalist, as MintPress’ efforts to contact Meyssan were unsuccessful. Locals, journalists and researchers interviewed by MintPress could not confirm Meyssan’s claims. Yet, many of these locals and researchers said they had heard of those claims from other sources within Argentina, but also noted that they were speculative, given that no one but Lewis or his employees knows who visits the property beyond the aforementioned events where select locals are invited to attend.

Beyond the alleged IDF “vacations” on Lewis’ land, his presence in the area has been controversial for other reasons, namely for concerns that he sought to usurp key regional resources. Indeed, journalist Gonzalo Sanchez noted in his 2004 book Patagonia Sold: The New Owners of the Land:

In El Bolsón, there are more than a few locals and city council members that believe that, behind his [Lewis’] generosity, there are other hidden objectives, like the possible control of the water reserves of this part of Patagonia (pg. 50).”

Inklings of the truth in relation to these concerns were evident as soon as Lewis acquired the property surrounding Lago Escondido. This large mountain lake, which Lewis’ property surrounds, is the water basin for two important regional rivers, the Manso and Puelo, which later unite in Chile and drain into the Pacific. It is also the lake the feeds other nearby lakes including the Soberanía Lakes and Montes Lake, among others. Lago Escondido itself is estimated to contain as many as 400 billion liters (~105 billion gallons) of freshwater.

In Argentina, as is also the case in neighboring Chile, water – whether in lakes, rivers or seas – is a public right and public access to all bodies of water is guaranteed by law. This legal concept — likely foreign to Lewis and other Westerners, whose home countries often enshrine private property rights over the public’s right to vital resources — has been the most visible way in which tensions between Lewis and locals have manifested. It was also the first real test of Lewis’ resolve to carve out his “independent state” in Patagonia and keep locals out.

Lewis closed off the public road from the highway to the lake and also closed the private road he built at a separate point from public access. According to several locals interviewed by MintPress who had tried to enter the area, private security in civilian clothing prevent people from using the roads either by vehicle or on foot. Federico Soria, who has himself tried to enter the area on several occasions, described the guards to MintPress as “intimidating” and “aggressive” and also said that the Montero family, the old owners of the land, block one of the roads before it enters Lewis’ property and are “heavily armed.”

The only remaining path is a steep – and in places, dangerous – mountain path that takes at least two days in each direction to traverse. The path is poorly marked and maintained and is only usable in summer, as it is blocked by snowfall in other seasons. Every person interviewed by MintPress who had seen or traversed the path described it as being suitable only for “experienced mountaineers.”

In 2009, Lewis suffered his first major defeat in his efforts to keep locals out of his “parallel state” when the regional court ruled that the Tacuifi road — which connects the lake to the main highway, Route 40, and crosses Lewis’ property — be opened. The ruling stated that this must be done in order to “ensure access to Lago Escondido with appropriate signaling and ensuring transability.” The court gave Lewis 120 days to comply.

However, he didn’t comply and instead his regional associates began openly threatening any who tried to visit “his” lake. The clearest threat came from Van Dittmar himself in 2011, when he publicly stated that he and other Hidden Lake S.A. employees would defend Lewis’ private property by “fighting with blood, if we have to.” Van Ditmar also said that he would keep locals from accessing the lake “with a Winchester [rifle] in hand, with blood if necessary.”

In 2012, the region’s Supreme Court upheld the 2009 ruling, as did Argentina’s national Supreme Court a year later. However, Lewis and Van Ditmar refused to open the Tacuifi road, Van Ditmar saying that the treacherous but “very pretty” mountain path should instead be used to access the lake. Argentine President Macri also stepped in and echoed Van Ditmar, stating that the lake is even more accessible than before Lewis bought the property.

The court battle continues to today, after the Supreme Court of Río Negro in 2016 withdrew its previous ruling and ordered that a new hearing with different judges issue a new ruling. Critics accused Lewis of using extreme “political pressure” at the regional and local level in order achieve this very surprising ruling.

Despite that, locals continue to fight for public access to Lago Escondido and defend Argentina’s sovereignty over Lewis’ private empire. The main manifestation of this effort is an annual “March for Sovereignty,” the most recent of which took place in early February of this year. The march is organized by the Foundation for the Cultural Integration and Promotion of Water (FIPCA), which is run by former Argentine marine Julio Cesár Urien. Like the prior marches of the same name, its participants walked for nearly three days on foot over the mountain trail to arrive on the shore of the lake, which – as mentioned above – they were within their legal rights to do.

Upon arriving, they were met by Lewis’ private security as well as members of the Río Negro police, who cornered them and told them that they couldn’t even go to the bathroom without fear of arrest for trespassing, even though lakeshores are also legally considered public spaces. Guillermo Martín Caviasc — a journalist for Barricada TV, who was present at the demonstration — called the combination of local police and private security Lewis’ “private army” and remarked that the police officers present where “in a situation of subordination like if they were visiting a foreign state controlled by Lewis.”

Two participants in the march, Andrea Gatabria and David Ramallo, mounted inflatable kayaks with the intention of placing an Argentine flag in a small island in the middle of the lake, itself technically a public space. Before they made it to the island, two speedboats belonging to Hidden Lake S.A. circled the kayaks in an effort to capsize them while taunting them, asking “Do you know what it’s like to die from hypothermia?”

After half an hour of taunts that seemed more like death threats, Lewis’ private security knocked over the kayaks, leaving Gatabria and Ramallo floating in the freezing water. After several minutes, several witnesses stated that one of the security guards told the two kayakers “Well, now do you see what it’s like to die of hypothermia?” Gatabria and Ramallo were, after some time, lifted into the guard boats, but had spent so much time in the frigid water that both had to be hospitalized.

National Senator for Río Negro, Magdalena Odarda, demanded accountability for the actions of Lewis’ private security and local police and FIPCA has begun legal action against Hidden Lake S.A. for threatening the lives of march participants. Neither Hidden Lake S.A. nor Lewis’ Tavistock Group, which oversees his business interests in Argentina and elsewhere, responded to MintPress inquiries regarding the incidents against march participants.

While Argentines have routinely experienced intimidation and aggression when attempting to access the lake, some foreigners have had very different experiences. Take, for instance, Scott Leahy*, an American now living in Chile, who, during a past trip to El Bolsón, was able to waltz right through onto Lewis’ Lago Escondido property when he was in the company of two ex-IDF soldiers who had been there before.

Leahy told MintPress that when he was backpacking through Argentine Patagonia in 2010 with a Chilean friend, he had met and become friends with two young Israelis who had recently finished their service in the IDF and were staying at the same youth hostel. One day, these two Israelis offered to take Leahy and his friend to what they called a “secret beach” nearby.

They all piled into a car and, upon taking a gravel road off of Route 40, arrived at a gate that Leahy confirmed to MintPress was the Tacuifi road entrance to Lewis’ Lago Escondido property (seen in an image earlier in this report). Leahy was unsure about continuing, given that the gate was closed and, as a foreigner, he was unfamiliar with the area. However, the Israelis urged him on, saying that they had been there before and knew where they were going.

When the group of backpackers encountered Hidden Lake S.A. employees and guards, the Israelis explained that they were from Israel and wanted to bring their friends to the beach. The Lago Escondido employees told the pair that the group was not officially allowed to enter the property, but they could pass. Leahy didn’t think anything of it at the time, and told MintPress that he had assumed the pair knew the owner, though the Israelis never mentioned Lewis at all and they showed no interest in meeting with him either. This suggests that they were not personal friends of Lewis, but also shows that they knew that they could access the lake without problem, even in the absence of a formal invitation.

While this anecdote suggests that the claims of Lewis hosting thousands of IDF soldiers annually may indeed have something to them, it also serves as a very troubling comparison to the way Argentines have been treated when trying to access the very same lake. Indeed, if foreigners, Israelis in this case, were amicably waved through despite no invitation from Lewis or Hidden Lake S.A., why are Argentines who try to do the same met with such violence and aggression, particularly when they have a legal right to do so?

Stealing El Bolsón’s resources for his own use

Though public access to Lago Escondido has been a major issue of contention between Lewis and the people of El Bolsón since the late 1990s, concerns that the British billionaire was intent on controlling the region’s water supply multiplied when firms connected to Lewis began to move forward with what is often referred to as simply the “Laderas project.”

As early as 2004, a man named Cipriano Soria started telling his neighbors that he had “sold” his land in an area known as Pampa de Ludden (Ludden’s Plain) to Lewis. However, Soria did not technically own the land, which was a publicly-owned nature reserve, but was granted an easement by the provincial government of Río Negro to use its meadows to graze his livestock as long as he paid a “grazing license.” Despite the fact that it was neither legally nor properly sold to Lewis, Lewis began to make plans for the land — plans that ignored the fact that the area was and technically remains under several legal protections due to its ecological and strategic importance to the region.

Lewis intended to use this land to build a private airport in the area but was met by strong local resistance in 2005, including from the local group Assembly for the Defense of Water and Land (ADAT). Several members of ADAT live in Mallín Ahogado next to Pampa de Ludden, which provides the adjacent farming community of 2,000 with nearly all of its water. Felicitas Libano, who lives in Mallín Ahogado, told MintPress that the importance of this area as a critical water resource — as well as its ecological importance as an old-growth native forest — led it to be named a nature reserve that was supposed to be prevented from falling into private hands.

ADAT’s eforts were successful and Lewis’ plan for the area seemed to have been defeated or, at least, put on hold. Then, in 2009, the town voted on Lewis’ private airport, with more than 79 percent of voters opposing it. However, unluckily for the people of El Bolsón, Lewis had much bigger plans than just an airport and he wasn’t planning on letting local democracy get in his way.

Fro 2006 to 2009, legal arrangements were made between the ski center’s owner, the Club Andino Piltriquitrón, and the provincial government that opened up the local ski center at the Perito Moreno mountain to “third party” management.

Then, in 2009, Mirta Soria, Cipriano’s daughter, “inherited” the land from her father — land that he technically did not own yet was somehow granted permission to purchase from the state, along with another protected territory between Pampa de Ludden and the ski center, even though the state was forbidden from doing so by regional and local laws. Just six months after she bought this territory and sold more than half of it to Van Ditmar’s brother-in-law Samy Mazza. This new and very large area under Van Ditmar/Lewis control is where El Bolsón’s, in addition Mallin Ahogado’s, water reserves are located.

Soon after the land purchase occurred, two businesses appeared — Laderas of Perito Moreno Association S.A. and Laderas of Parallel 42, both of which are directly connected to Lewis and were given ownership of the lands in Pampa de Ludden and the other area recently purchased by Van Ditmar’s relative. That same year, both of these linked businesses proposed a “lottery” whereby the provincial government would select a private company to manage the local ski center. Laderas of Parallel 42 won the lottery.

Subsequently, the other Laderas company, Laderas of Perito Moreno, began plans to transform the land illegally acquired by Van Ditmar’s brother-in-law, Samy Mazza, as well as the portion still owned by Mirta Soria into a luxury subdivision of more than 1,000 luxury homes for wealthy Argentines and foreigners, along with a golf course, shopping centers, an artificial lake, and a private airport. This planned venture was subsequently promoted by pro-Lewis businessmen and media outlets as necessary for the successful development and improvement of the ski center.

With the court battle underway and the project still lacking approval from El Bolsón’s city council, the regional governor, Alberto Weretilneck – a well-known Lewis ally – teamed up with Lewis-associated local businessmen in an effort to strongly pressure El Bolsón’s mayor at the time, Ricardo García, to sign a pledge that, once legal issues were resolved, the project would be fast-tracked for approval. García refused and Weretilneck along with other Lewis associates in the area began to push for his resignation. However, local protests kept García in power and, before leaving his post as mayor, García issued a decree that temporarily prohibited the Laderas project from advancing.

Clearly unhappy with this turn of events, the Laderas firms challenged the suspension of the project in court. Around this same time, members of local groups that had opposed the Laderas project reported several incidents of violence and intimidating acts, including threatening phone calls, their cars being set on fire, and the burning of a radio station as well as a community center in Mallín Ahogado.

In the case of architect and local politician Luis Martin, he was threatened with “lynching” by two Lewis associates – local businessmen Juan Carlos Martínez and Fabián Tornero – and his home was later broken into by armed thugs, one of whom accidentally cut himself with his machete and later fled the scene. Before escaping, the man had told Martin, “They have you targeted, they are going to kill you.”

In a 2011 article in Tiempo Argentina, Martínez referred to Lewis as “my friend” and was noted as a regular participant in meetings with Van Ditmar. The same article goes on to note that, in those meetings with Van Ditmar, Tornero is “influential” and further notes that Tornero is a known associate of Lewis.

In 2015, after García’s decree was challenged in court by Lewis’ firms, a judge ruled that the decree was legal but had not been written properly and therefore cancelled it. Soon after, a new pro-Lewis mayor and city council took charge and quickly signed a legal agreement with the Laderas companies, allowing them to build a “smaller project,” while claiming that any attempt to block the project – as García had done – could lead to another costly, lengthy legal battle that the municipal government just couldn’t afford. However, as Guido Augello told MintPress, this was hardly accurate, given that the local government could have appealed the decision regarding the decree, suggesting that this was just a convenient excuse to fast-track the project.

A few months after signing this agreement with the Laderas firms, the city council held a public hearing at which the vast majority of attendees from the community overwhelmingly rejected and criticized the project. Not getting the response it had hoped for, the council held a “secret” extraordinary meeting — secret because they declined to give the public the required notice needed to register to attend and participate in the meeting. With no one having registered, Pogliano decided to keep the meeting “closed” and placed police officers at the entrances to keep the townspeople out by force. The council subsequently decided to approve the Laderas project. Angry locals moved to occupy local government buildings in response, where they were targeted by riot police with tear gas.

The move generated several large-scale protests in El Bolsón, which started in 2016 and continued into 2017. Local resistance to the actions taken by the city council and mayor in relation to the Laderas project included a citizen occupation of the main plaza for three months, which was subject to police intimidation and violence, as well as three major protests, including the largest in El Bolsón’s history. That march against the Laderas project attracted an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 participants — quite a feat considering that the town’s urban and rural population boasts little more than 25,000 total inhabitants.

The reason for this mass mobilization, according to Augello, was that “even many of the people that like Lewis or believe his ‘Uncle Joe’ image oppose the Laderas project” and its associated airport. It’s not hard to understand why, considering that electricity and water intended for the townspeople of El Bolsón could soon be diverted to the wealthy outsiders who buy homes in “Lewislandia,” a derogatory term used to describe the Laderas project by some locals.

Yet, not only does Lewis intend to privatize El Bolsón’s water reserves, he and those developing his Laderas project also plan to divert the tourism that keeps its economy alive by instead diverting traffic from the main highway (Route 40) into his newly planned “city,” according to Federico Soria, a member of the Union of Patagonian Assemblies who has extensively researched Lewis’ local businesses. In an extensive 2016 article on the Laderas project and other Lewis-linked ventures, Soria wrote:

It is the intention of the developers of Laderas to unite the complex to Route 40 through two paved roads that they plan to build north and south of El Bolsón….The Laderas variant road would be an advantageous shortcut [around El Bolsón].…[This] would benefit Lewis but economically endanger the community of El Bolsón…”

Furthermore, in 2016, Lewis completed a hydroelectric plant on the Escondido River — in the name of another of his local firms, Patagonia Energía — which passes through his property and feeds into the lake of the same name. However, he was granted permission to do so only if he connected the plant to El Bolsón in order to help the town resolve its ongoing and highly problematic electricity shortages. Once the plant was connected to El Bolsón, Lewis would become the main electricity provider to El Bolsón, as its current, aging diesel generators would be shut down.

Yet, instead of following the planned route for the power line that would give power to El Bolsón, it was diverted to the planned zone for the Laderas project, where it has remained “stopped” for years, even though his license to use the river for electricity production expired in 2015 owing to his company’s failure to connect the plant to El Bolsón in the time allotted by the license. As in so many other cases, Lewis and his companies have suffered no repercussions and continue to use the river for private power production. This situation has led some locals to speculate that Lewis has no intention of ever providing hydroelectric power to El Bolsón and it is instead a resource being guarded especially for his planned Laderas villa.

In effect, Lewis and his local representatives are working the resources they have acquired — water, electricity and tourism traffic — away from the town of El Bolsón and to the new “luxury” town of Laderas they hope to build to its north, a town that is an extension of Lewis’ own “independent” state. If this project is allowed to be completed, the people of El Bolsón will face a new troubling reality of resource insecurity and see its economy falter, as a crucial stream of revenue is diverted to the personal pet project of a foreign and predatory billionaire.

Yet, though Lewis won that particular battle in 2017, he is far from winning the war. Soon after the scandalous way in which the project was approved, the project again found itself challenged in court — placing it in legal limbo, unable to advance. Though the project is supposed to be blocked from moving forward until the conclusion of this latest legal battle, satellite images taken last August and shared with MintPress by local radio station FM Alas (shown above) reveal that Lewis’ businesses have already begun construction on the Laderas project, a clear indication that Lewis and his associates expect their impunity to continue.

Lewis’ Tavistock Group did not respond to MintPress inquiries about the Laderas project or the satellite images shown above.

Lewis’ “irregular” acquisition of Lago Escondido, the Laderas property, and his use of private security to block civilian access to the lake that is — by law — public property have long been decried as flagrant affronts to Argentina’s national sovereignty. Yet, while Lewis’ activities in and around Lago Escondido certainly do undermine existing Argentine laws, it is another Lewis-linked property in the Río Negro province that has done far more to erode Argentina’s national sovereignty.

Though Lewis’ plan to build an airport in Lago Escondido was technically approved but has not been able to move forward, Lewis – through his foreman Van Ditmar – purchased a sizeable property at the same latitude as Lago Escondido, but hours away on the Atlantic Coast. The property would soon become the site of Lewis’ private airport as well as a beachfront mansion. That airport, located south of Playas Doradas, was completed in February of 2008 and local media noted that its construction was “systemically hidden” from the public and was not subject to environmental impact assessments as normally required by law.

Most notably, however, there has never been any presence of Argentine customs or any other form of Argentine government control over what or who flies into or out of that airport, even though the airport is capable of receiving international flights. This point is particularly concerning in light of allegations that Lewis receives thousands of IDF soldiers annually on his property.

Joe Lewis’ private airport as seen on Google Maps

Furthermore, the Defense Ministry of Argentina has confirmed that not only is there no formal state control over what lands or takes off from this private airport, but that there are no radars in the area that even allow Argentine authorities to track nearby flight movements, including those of international flights. This means that no one but Lewis and his associates knows for sure how many flights land or take off from this area or where these flights originate or their intended destinations.

More shocking still, in 2010 then-Defense Minister Nilda Garré, in responding to a complaint from local politicians over the flagrant illegality of the airport, defended the airport’s presence by stating that it “could be used to facilitate rapid assistance of the state to locals in the event of disasters or emergencies.” To date, in the more than 10 years of its operation, it has never been used for any such purpose, according to those interviewed for this report.

The airport in Playas Doradas is roughly the same size as the airport in San Carlos de Bariloche (though some say it is larger), and is capable of receiving at least two large commercial-size passenger planes at a time. Much as with Lago Escondido, public access to the airport is denied, owing to the fact that the sprawling 15,000 hectare (~37,065 acres) property surrounding the airport is privately owned by a front company called Bahía Dorada S.A., which itself is legally owned by Lewis’ “foreman” Van Ditmar. However, the airport itself is owned by Westwind Aviation S.A. (formerly owned by Tavistock Aviation Argentina S.A., a subsidiary of Lewis’ Tavistock Group. Westwind Aviation S.A. is based at Lewis’ Lago Escondido property, as is Bahía Dorada S.A.. Neither Westwind Aviation S.A. nor the Tavistock Group responded to inquiries from MintPress regarding the lack of Argentine government oversight over the airport.

In order to realize the project, Van Ditmar – an Argentine citizen – had to be the owner of the property, as the area where the airport is built falls within a “National Security Zone” that prohibits land in that zone from being owned by foreigners on the basis of national security interests. In addition, the airport and the surrounding property, much like Lago Escondido, has a large and sophisticated private security presence.

The airport is estimated to have cost $20 million and Van Ditmar has publicly justified the airport’s existence by stating that Lewis not only “had the money” to build the complex but that it also made his ability to travel to his Lago Escondido property “easier.” This latter point is hard to believe given that the existing airport in San Carlos de Bariloche, which receives both private and commercial planes, is several hours closer to Lewis’ property than is his private airport in Playas Doradas. The notable difference between the two is that the private airport has no Argentine government oversight while the Bariloche airport does.

Few knew of the existence of the airport or the fact that access to the beach in that area had been effectively cut off by the Lewis/Van Ditmar project until a local woman, Elvira Linares, went on the television program “Documentos América,” hosted by Argentine journalist Facundo Pastor. On that program, Linares shared her experience of trying to pass through the now-private territory, noting that access to the ocean had been illegally blocked off. She also shared video footage she had taken of the massive, yet largely unknown to the public, private airport.

Mere hours after the program aired, Linares’ home was filled with bullet holes by still unknown assailants in what local media described as a blatant act of intimidation that led National Senator for Río Negro, Magdalena Odarda, to request that the government extend its protection to Linares, whose life was in danger. Efforts to contact Linares for comment for this report were unsuccessful.

Senator Odarda has arguably been the most well-known figure to demand accountability regarding the numerous irregularities surrounding the private airport. Odarda has, with limited success, repeatedly denounced the airport, on the basis of the fact that there is “no state control” over what or who passes through the airport.

Odarda has also noted that the area where the airport is constructed is highly “strategic,” which poses a danger given that it is exclusively controlled by a foreigner, an Englishman. Odardo has pointed out that the airport is located on the important 42° parallel, which divides the regions of Río Negro and Chubut, and is only two hours away by plane from the disputed Falkland Islands, which are controlled by the United Kingdom but also claimed by Argentina. This dispute dates back to the 19th century and was the principal factor behind the Falklands War between Argentina and the U.K. in the 1980s, which many Argentines remember quite bitterly for the peace treaty Argentina signed after its defeat by England. Many Argentines have compared the document to the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I.

Notably, there has been considerable evidence that Lewis’ airport has received planes from the Falkland Islands, which was the subject of a formal complaint made in 2010 to Argentina’s defense minister by then-governor of Argentina’s Tierra del Fuego province, Fabiana Ríos.

Given the numerous laws that Lewis’ activities in Río Negro have broken at both the local and federal level, one would expect that somebody in the government – at least the local government – would hold him accountable. While some politicians like Magdalena Odarda and others have tried, the lack of impunity surrounding Lewis’ activities largely owes to his “friendships” with local and regional politicians as well as the country’s president.

One of the innumerable examples is Sergio Plunket. Plunket, who is in charge of Vial Rionegrina Sociedad del Estado (VIARSE), the regional body in charge of controlling public roads including the road leading to Lago Escondido, also works as a private “ecological consultant” for Lewis’ Hidden Lake S.A. Plunket also authorized the construction of Lewis’ Playas Doradas airport. Another clear example is Bruco Pogliano, El Bolsón’s current mayor, who is also Lewis’ long-time accountant in Argentina.

Another example that Gonzalo Sanchez noted (pp. 50-51) in his book, Patagonia Sold , is how Pablo Verani, ex-governor of Río Negro, started a long tradition of politicians making regular visits to Lago Escondido for Lewis-financed barbeque feasts, when he celebrated his win as the 1997 regional governor on the shores of the magnate’s privatized lake.

In addition to his undeniable influence among key local, regional and even national politicians, Lewis also enjoys considerable influence in the regional press and several former employees of his have become important figures in local and regional media. For example in 2016, according to local media, Dalila Pinacho, who long served as a lawyer and spokeswoman for Lewis’ Lago Escondido firm Hidden Lake S.A., became the director of the Nequén branch of Argentina’s National Radio, apparently through her “close” connections to local politicians.

Another journalist, Julio Álvarez — who described himself, to Gonzalo Sanchez in 2004 at an event in Lago Escondido, as Lewis’ “spokesman” — now works at a radio station in Viedma, Argentina, and was previously the El Bolsón correspondent for the regional newspaper Río Negro. Lewis also funds the local newspaper Ruta 40 and has stakes in other local newspapers such as El Cordillerano, Bolsón Web Patagonia, and El Ciudadano in Bariloche. Eliana Almonacid, who used to work for Ruta 40, told the national outlet Tiempo Argentina in 2014 that the Ruta 40’s director Nancy Aleuy, who also works for Hidden Lake S.A., told her that “Lewis had bought all the media outlets” in the region.

Lewis’ “Parallel State” is just the beginning

Lewis’ control over the local authorities and local press in Río Negro, and the complete impunity of his actions and those of his associates, have made it clear that in Argentina there is a de facto different legal system for oligarchs like Lewis and for the vast majority of Argentina’s citizens. This fact — in combination with the control Lewis and his associates exercise over the region’s key resources, including its water and energy production — has led to the creation of what some like Federico Soria have called a “parallel state” within Patagonia. However, this “parallel state” is, in reality, a microcosm of a much larger project currently underway that is aimed at the domination of the entirety of Argentine Patagonia by predatory oligarchical interests, the majority of which are directly connected to Lewis and his associates.

As will be explored in Part Two of this series, the Soros-led oligarch network, of which Lewis is a part in Argentina, has expanded its efforts to control Patagonia’s vast and strategic resources, including the region’s oil and gas wealth in addition to the domination of its freshwater resources and hydroelectricity production. Subsequent articles will then show that this effort is just the beginning, as this network and its close ties to the International Monetary Fund are being used to transfer ownership of vast state lands to their control in exchange for “debt relief.” The ultimate endgame appears to be the expansion of this “parallel state” — which Lewis has already helped to create in Río Negro and beyond, and which is controlled by small number of mostly foreign oligarchs — into a full-scale operation for extracting the region’s riches and exploiting its people

Editor’s Notes: A previous version of this article stated that both Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and Mauricio Macri had “friendly” relationships with Lewis and his associates. Fernandez de Kirchner, though she has a “friendly” relationship with Lewis associate Marcelo Mindlin, does not necessarily have one with Lewis but has used his private helicopter. The sentence was updated to clarify this difference. Also, an asterisk (*) after a name indicates that a person’s real name was not used after they requested that MintPress not use their real name in this report.

1316,"Dry needling is an alternative pain relief technique that physical therapists may administer for muscle pain. It involves the insertion of a small, solid filament into a stressed muscle’s site of spasm and pain, also known as a trigger point. By doing so, the muscle relaxes and blood flow increases into the area, alleviating pain and improving motion.

Trigger points are often the result of an injury to a different part of the body, because other muscles overcompensate for imbalances and weakness in the injured area. Because of this overcompensation, muscle spasm occurs, causing discomfort and pain in the muscle.
• Results can be immediate or take up to 72 hours
• One to five treatments is the expected course
• Rehab exercises are part of the treatment

Once dry needling resets the tone of muscle, your physical therapist works on correcting strength and mobility deficits in the muscle, which allows healing and prevents injury.",mainstream,M0edef,big.foot
380,"Chinese citizens will be forced to pass a facial recognition test to use the Internet in the latest expansion of the country’s draconian social credit score system.

“At present, a Chinese citizen will need to show his or her ID card while applying for a landline or the internet,” reports the Daily Mail. “The facial-recognition test is set to verify that the ID card belongs to the applicant.”

Under its social credit score system, China punishes people who criticize the government, as well as numerous other behaviors, including;

– Bad driving.

 – Smoking on trains.

 – Buying too many video games.

 – Buying too much junk food.

 – Buying too much alcohol.

 – Calling a friend who has a low credit score .

 – Having a friend online who has a low credit score.

 – Posting “fake news” online.

 – Visiting unauthorized websites.

 – Walking your dog without a leash.

 – Letting your dog bark too much.

Back in August, the Communist state bragged about how it had prevented 2.5 million “discredited entities” from purchasing plane tickets and 90,000 people from buying high speed train tickets in the month of July alone.

People in the west are already being banned by entire websites and services due to their opinions.

Given that Silicon Valley has aided China in helping develop its social credit system, how long before they’re banned from using the Internet altogether?

247,"In 16th century Scotland, the alchemist John Damian, who was known to expense a suspicious amount of whiskey in his experiments to find the elusive philosopher’s stone, decided he could fly. He fashioned a pair of wings from feathers and “took off from the lofty battlements of Stirling Castle for a flight to Paris.” He didn’t make it to France, but he did plummet a few feet away from the castle and break a leg. The failure, he later claimed, was due to using feathers from chickens, which can’t so much fly, when he should have used eagle feathers instead.

Really, the problem had more to do with mammals like us not being cut out for flight. Well, except for bats. There are, though, critters like sugar gliders and flying squirrels, which can pull off some pretty solid glides. But compared to the adorable and little-known colugo, they got nothin’. This is the most accomplished mammalian glider of all—on account of being essentially a giant flap of skin—capable of soaring an incredible 200 feet from tree to tree. Its expansive membrane, known as a patagium, stretches from its face to the tips of its digits all the way back to its tail, so “geometrically, it has the greatest surface area that you can have between those limbs without actually evolving an entire wing like bats did,” said conservation biologist Jan Janecka of Duquesne University.

With such a beautifully evolved body, the colugo, also known misleadingly as a flying lemur (more on that later), spends its nights leisurely gliding through the forests of Southeast Asia. Their skeletons, while not nearly as frail as those of bats, are thinner and more elongated than that of a squirrel, reducing their weight while increasing their surface area. And their huge eyes, Janecka says, gives them not only good night vision, but excellent depth perception—no insignificant advantage when you’re coming in for a hard landing on the trunk of a tree.

Colugos are such adept gliders that mothers have no problem bringing their babies along for the ride. And they’ll do so for quite some time, for their young are born highly underdeveloped. They’re not as helpless as, say, marsupial young ‘uns, which enjoy the comfort of their mother’s pouch, but certainly not as developed as most mammals.

Still, the newborns cling to mom as she sails around the rainforest in search of food, mostly sap and leaves and shoots. And as if the colugo’s flappy skin weren’t bizarre enough, its teeth are shaped like little combs. This could be helping them in some way to feed, says Janecka, or may play a part in grooming to snag parasites on their skin. That’s right. Colugos may be brushing their hair with combs built right into their faces.

Unfortunately, beyond watching mothers sail around with their babies, we don’t know much at all about the colugo’s social life. And efforts to keep them in captivity have largely been for naught. Remember that these are creatures used to gliding up to 200 feet, and good luck finding that kind of space in a zoo. “Basically their enclosures weren’t large enough to allow them to glide long distances,” said Janecka. “And because they couldn’t glide, they couldn’t keep their patagium well maintained and dry enough.” They developed infections on their skin, perhaps from a fungus, and died.

Ironically enough, it’s too much space in the wild that’s threatening some colugo populations. Deforestation can strand species in islands of trees, but even if loggers just thin out spots in the forest, it’s big trouble for the colugo. They’re the most accomplished mammalian glider on Earth, sure, but if there’s too much space between trees, the colugo runs the risk of sinking right to the ground. And as you can see below in the video from National Geographic (they strapped a camera to a colugo—enough said), the creature’s extra skin makes it all but worthless when anywhere but the canopy. It’s an easy target in a habitat packed with predators.

Because colugos tend to live in isolated habitats and because they insist on emerging only at night, much of what we know about them comes from anecdotal evidence. Case in point: colugo doo-doo. It … moves.

“I’ve seen some videos of fecal material that they’ve dropped where there’s so many worms it’s actually moving,” said Janecka. “It’s squirming around.” The colugo digestive tract, it seems, has a really, really high parasite load. “And that whole dynamic, whether it happened to be in a population that has a lot of parasites or it’s something that’s more normal for the colugos that they’ve learned to deal with, that’s one of those unknown questions at this point.”

What is abundantly clear is that the colugo has a very long digestive tract, which makes sense for a creature that eats trees. That stuff takes a whole lot of time to digest. But such long guts could also be acting as a sort of mansions for parasitic worms, which have lots of room to make themselves comfortable. Until someone starts studying colugo turds at length, though, we’ll have to leave this one a mystery.

But thanks to Janecka and his colleagues, we’re now confident of this: Colugos are primates’ closest living relatives. So although “flying lemur” is a misnomer, both because colugos aren’t flying but gliding and they’re not a kind of lemur, the name isn’t that far off.

“Because they have these adaptations for gliding, originally people sort of threw them in with bats,” Janecka said. “But when they looked at the actual morphology of the skull, there was evidence that they’re closely related to primates.” When Janecka and his colleagues did a genomic analysis of the colugo, this suspicion was confirmed. It turns out that around 90 million years ago, at the height of the dinosaurs’ reign when mammals were just tiny furballs scurrying about trying not to get stepped on, the colugo’s ancestors split off from our primate lineage. Some 25 million years later, the dinosaurs’ time came to an end, leading to the explosion of mammalian diversity.

In fairness, though, it’s the arthropods and bacteria who really rule the world, not us mammals. But they can’t do cool things like glide 200 feet or comb themselves with their teeth…or drop poop that moves on its own.

903,"Ignition experiments at NIF are being performed at a variety of target scales. Smaller targets require less energy and can be fielded more frequently. Successful small target designs can be scaled up to take advantage of the full NIF laser energy and power. In this talk, we will consider a rigorous framework for scaling from smaller to larger targets. The framework uses both simulation and experimental results to build a statistical prediction of target performance as scale is increased. Our emphasis is on quantifying uncertainty in scaling predictions with the goal of identifying the dominant contributors to that uncertainty. We take as a particular example the Big Foot platform that produces a round, 0.8 scale implosion with the potential to scale to full NIF size (1.0 scale).

921,"Imagine a hulking, growling, 8-foot-tall woodland creature so elusive that professional trackers can’t find it, scientists can only speculate about it and believers can’t prove -- definitively -- that it exists.

Hiding deep in the forest may be your modus operandi, Bigfoot, but Hollywood and Madison Avenue are pushing you -- however reluctantly -- into the spotlight. A slew of documentary, TV and film projects including Animal Planet’s current hit “Finding Bigfoot,” and a Sasquatch film trilogy from “Blair Witch Project” director Eduardo Sanchez are poised to get past the old grainy images of yesterday and give the hairy 800-pound biped a high-def close-up.

“There’s been a real upswing in scholarly interest along with this huge undercurrent of popularity among the general public,” said Jeffrey Meldrum, the Idaho State anatomy and anthropology professor and primates expert who wrote “Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science” as a companion to a Discovery Channel special of the same name. “There’s something about the human psyche that really connects with this icon.”

Campfire stories, eyewitness reports and grainy videos have kept the legend alive for decades in the U.S. and worldwide. (The mythology goes back much further if you take cave drawings into account.) And Bigfoot has been a pop culture fixture since the 1950s, popping up in movies, commercials and as a guest on ‘70s TV hits like “The Six Million Dollar Man” and “The Bionic Woman.”

Each time there’s a new development -- such as evidence of a yeti allegedly uncovered in Russia last fall or a Bigfoot body purportedly discovered in Georgia, both of which turned out to be fake -- there’s a spike in online searches, blog posts, news reports and, inevitably, Bigfoot-centric entertainment.

“Blair Witch’s” Sanchez is working on a Bigfoot-based horror movie, the first of a planned trilogy, and a group of Bigfoot enthusiasts is putting together a documentary called “Sasquatch: The Quest.” Meldrum, along with launching an online scholarly journal, is producing an Internet TV project and considering an expanded version of “Legend Meets Science.”

“We all want to believe that there are still monsters lurking in the secret corners of the planet, and that’s the allure of Bigfoot,” said Marjorie Kaplan, president of Animal Planet, home to the hit series “Finding Bigfoot. “It’s fun to be reminded that we don’t know everything.”

“Finding Bigfoot” follows four eccentric field researchers who travel to towns where there have been sightings, gather stories from the locals and set out on their own expeditions. The colorful characters have coined “squatch” as a term of endearment and say things like “It’s really squatchy out here,” to describe remote areas they think are harboring Bigfoots.

The series, which attracted 1.6 million viewers for its second season premiere, will launch its third season this summer. “If anybody’s going to find him, it’s going to be us,” Kaplan declared, adding with a laugh, “hopefully after 100 episodes.”

In coming months, cable TV will be overrun with Sasquatch programming. Syfy thriller “Bigfoot” promises a “big and nasty, teeth and claws” star nestled in a kitschy popcorn flick, according to Thomas Vitale, the network’s executive vice president of programming. Airing this summer, the Saturday night movie pits former child stars Barry Williams and Danny Bonaduce against each other in a search for the larger-than-life biped at a rural music festival. It fits strategically with the network’s tradition of over-the-top original action movies like “Sharktopus” and “Piranhaconda.”

“Bigfoot is a classic trope of the creature feature,” Vitale said. “It’s a story that spans a lot of cultures ... and it’s ripe for reinvention.”

TV has been doing exactly that by using Bigfoot in purely fictional, and sometimes goofy, ways in series such as Disney Channel’s “Phineas and Ferb” and Nickelodeon’s “iCarly,” not to mention frequent reruns of the ‘80s family comedy film “Harry and the Hendersons.”

In “iBelieve in Bigfoot,” the “iCarly” kids head into the woods looking for the creature in what executive producer Dan Schneider said is one of the series’ most popular episodes to date. The youngsters never actually see Bigfoot, but they hear a menacing growl as they see their RV drive away, leaving them stranded.

“The implication is that Bigfoot’s real, and he’s also a car thief,” Schneider said.

It’s a kid-relevant subject because “every generation discovers the Bigfoot legend, sort of like discovering the Beatles,” said Dan Povenmire, one of the creators of the animated “Phineas and Ferb.” He and partner Jeff “Swampy” Marsh wrote an episode called “Get That Bigfoot Outta My Face,” that sprang from their own childhood memories of hearing scary stories and seeing the famous 1967 Patterson footage of a purported Bigfoot in Northern California.

Even commercials have fun using Bigfoot as a punch line: A current ad for Stride Whitemint gum stars Olympic medalist Shaun White and a yeti who socks a guy in the gut so he’ll spit out his long-lasting chewing gum and replace it with another.

At the more serious end of the spectrum are interview-based docu-style shows such as History’s “Bigfoot: The Definitive Guide,” National Geographic’s “Is It Real?” and Syfy’s “Destination Truth.” Travel Channel’s “Legends of the Ozarks” and “Bigfootville” will poke around in isolated areas for Bigfoot evidence in episodes airing in late March.

Cliff Barackman, an elementary school teacher and cast member on “Finding Bigfoot,” said a TV series dedicated to Sasquatch hunting was “long overdue.”

“When there are multiple shows about cakes and ghosts, why not a show about Bigfoot?” Barackman said. “Our show reinforces the fact that we’re looking for a species, not an individual, and that we’re trying to help people understand what a Bigfoot might actually be.”",mainstream,M0d48c,big.foot
534,"Having defeated Arsenal 5-1 in Munich in the first leg of their round-of-16 tie, Bayern have already gone a long way towards securing a spot in the Champions League quarterfinals. As long as they don't concede four unanswered goals, they will be on their way to the next round.

However, Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti is well aware of the fact that it is possible to blow large first-leg leads in the Champions League. In the 2003-04 season, when he was coach of AC Milan, his team took a 4-1 lead over Deportivo La Coruna in the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal - played at home. The Spanish club turned the tie on its head in the second leg in A Coruna, beating Milan 4-0 to advance to the semifinals.

""We are not going on a company outing, this is the Champions League. The door is open, but we must go through it seriously and respectfully,"" Bayern Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told reporters at Munich airport on Monday before the team boarded a charter jet to London.

Jerome Boateng is the only player who will have to miss Bayern's trip to London due to injury as he continues to recover from a shoulder problem. Philipp Lahm will have to sit out too after picking up his third yellow card in the Champions League this season.

Rafinha, who started in Bayern's 3-0 victory over Schalke in their German Cup quarterfinal last week, is expected to step into Lahm's position in defense while Manuel Neuer is to wear the captain's armband.

The Gunners certainly have an uphill road to climb as they seek to turn the tables on Bayern, who have qualified for the Champions League semifinals in each of the last five seasons. Assuming that they fail in their comeback attempt on Tuesday, it will be the seventh straight season in which Arsenal has been eliminated in the round of 16.

Arsene Wenger, who is in his 21st season as Arsenal's manager, has once again come under fire after delivering similar results in recent years. He received a lot of criticism after leaving Alexis Sanchez - who with 17 goals is the team's leading scorer in the Premier League - out of the team in their 3-1 loss to Liverpool on Saturday.

Sanchez, who scored Arsenal's only goal from the penalty spot in the first leg, could be one of the key players for the North London side in their comeback attempt. However, Wenger will not have Mesut Özil at his disposal, after the manager told Monday's press conference that the German internatonal will be forced to sit this one out due to an illness.",mainstream,M0b1c3,big.foot

By SERGE BIELANKO | December 3rd, 2012 at 4:23 pm

 People who don’t believe in Santa Claus are starting to piss me off.

 I mean, what gives, you guys?

 Do you seriously refuse to believe that there is even a remote possibility that a robust, ageless, elfin-man with super magical powers and the ability to travel at the speed of light to deliver happiness to the children of the world exists?

 I don’t get the whole ‘skeptical’ thing here.

 What exactly is so hard to fathom about deer that fly anyway?

 And what?

 You think elves are something someone just happened to make up?

 God, you’re jaded.

 But fine.

 To each his own.

 In my mind though, no matter how bad you have messed up in this life you’ve been living the last 20 or 50 or 70 years or whatever, you haven’t ever screwed things up nearly as bad as you did on that day long ago when you finally sighed into the afternoon wind and whispered to yourself those terribly tragic four words: “There is no Santa.”

 Why do we do that to ourselves?

 Why do we reach an age like 10 or 12 and all of the sudden question maybe the greatest tale we have ever been told? Is it some sort of twisted rite of passage? Are we supposed to feel cooler or, sakes alive, BE cooler once we’ve ‘followed the sheep’ and declared Santa Claus to be extinct?

 It’s a mystery to me.

 Just when we could use a friend like old Saint Nick to help guide us through The Age of Zits and The Prama™ (Prom Drama) Years, we turn around and thank him for his long dedication to our boundless joy by informing him that he is nothing but a bunch of bull.

 Anyhow, I have to try and stem the tide here this year; I’ve got to do my part to try and bring at least a few of you back into the righteous fold of Kringleism (that unfettered belief in magical things).

 See, as one of the few remaining adult believers (and also as former Vice-President of the Unofficial Santa Claus Fan Club, Southeastern Pennsylvania Chapter #828 from 2002-2003), I should think that I’ve been privy to a wee bit more of the truth about who Santa really is than most of you. Plus, as a father to two (count ‘em TWO!) die-hard SantaHeads, I feel like it’s my duty to try and save the last of the lovable legends before it’s all too late.

 So listen up, people of Earth! Read the truth here today and then decided for yourselves!

 You wanted the proof and I’ve got it.

 Santa Claus is real: always was, always will be.



Most of us agree that department stores and the like all hire ‘Elves’ to play the role of Santa in the month leading up to Christmas. But recent revelations in Santa Believer Circles highlight this special photo from the Sears store in Duluth, MN 1964. In it, Mary and Bobby Richards stare into the eyes of what is largely believed to be the REAL Santa Claus in one of his very rare store appearances captured on film! Why do we think this? Because Bobby, now a respected brat salesman in Sheboygan, WI swears it.

Few details are clear about Santa Claus’s youth. However, in 1993, at a yard sale in suburban Reykjavik, Iceland, a woman bought a shoebox full of pictures that contained this stunning find. In it, what appears to be a very young Santa Claus darts through a room with swiftness. Experts all agree that the distinct scoobyish hat he is wearing is found only in distinct pockets of the North Pole , giving further proof that the boy in the picture really is a very young Santa Claus!",conspiracy,C02840,big.foot

Sure, there's a bit of gloom among economic pundits, the politicians are bickering and dickering like good 'uns, and the Middle East is going to hell in a handbasket. But, as Chris Tarrant so irritatingly says, we don't want to give you that.

No, we wordmongers want you to be happy, and we have ways of making you smile. So forget boring old news, and see what fun we've brought you.

The Daily Telegraph has a splendid joke on its front page about an academic at Birmingham University who has carried out a five-year study of the ""cultural meanings"" of snowmen. Dr Tricia Cusack, who must surely be the most sought-after guest at smart parties in the West Midlands this season, wants us to build snow-women instead.

""We need to be alert to which particular images have got currency,"" she explains. ""Why is it always male, and why is it so popular at Christmas? At least the snowman has lost his pipe as society is less geared towards promoting smoking.""

Talking of snowballs - sorry about that but the Telegraph didn't oblige and we have our standards to keep down - the Guardian this morning tells us that Californian scientists have worked out why penguins waddle. It's because they have such short legs and such big feet, that's why. And you thought Californians were dumb?

Not to be outdone, the mirth-merchants of the Times have come up with another animal yarn based on academia. This time scientists in Washington state (could there be something lurking in the water supply on the West coast of America?) have identified a dent in the ground as a possible 'footprint' of the long-sought North American ape known to kids everywhere as Bigfoot. The print is not actually of a foot, but rather of the left forearm, hip, thigh and heel of a large primate. More of a bumprint, really.

Now we've got down to the botty jokes, we mustn't overlook the front page of the Sun, almost entirely devoted this morning to what Guy Ritchie will be wearing under his kilt when he marries Madonna in Scotland tomorrow. Nothing, that's what. And, er, that's it, except to mention that in its noble effort to stretch the story to a couple of hundred words, the Sun includes possibly the oldest joke in Christendom: Q: Is anything worn under the kilt? A: No, everything is in good working order. Ho ho ho.

Back to the animals: the Mirror, after pages of boring real news about brawling popstars and bawling politicians, gets down to the real biz with a picture of a young elephant painting pictures. You really don't need to know why, but you deserve to know that the headline is Botticelephant.

And there's more, much more to come, judging by the latest offerings on the Press Association wire. There's the likely tale, for instance, of the couples converging on Scotland in search of idyllic wedding locations, just like that whatsername.

And the Daily Mail is going to quiver with rage about the latest outbreak of political correctness in the forces: ""The armed forces could be falling foul of health and safety rules because their military bands play too loudly and their rifles are too noisy, it emerged today. The Ministry of Defence has set up a high-level working group to look at the problem after receiving a warning that it could be in breach of regulations on noise levels in the workplace.""

591,"Good news, kids! Far more companies are hiring seasonal staff this year than last, with new research from CareerBuilder showing that 41 percent of employers plan to hire summer workers, up from 29 percent in 2016. So, it shouldn’t be too difficult to find a job and help pay down that looming college debt or give back to your folks. But wait — that’s not quite how things work anymore. The summer job, once an obligation, is now merely an option among a few possible routes.

""The summer job is disappearing, and has been over the last 30 years,” said Marc Prosser, co-founder and publisher of FitSmallBusiness.com. An analysis from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that as of July 2016, the teen labor force participation rate was 43.2 percent, down nearly 30 percentage points from its peak of 71.8 percent in July 1978.

There are a number of factors contributing to this decline, but most prominent among them is the increasing popularity of internships.

“Many more students are seeking out internships or research opportunities over the summer now, as opposed to when I first started counseling students [nearly 20 years ago],"" said Dr. Kat Cohen, CEO and founder of IvyWise, an admissions counseling services company. “Everything is more competitive these days, so getting hands-on work experience or hands-on research experience, and making contacts at companies that students might want to work at post-graduation can be a smart move.”

It’s becoming more common for college students to balance unpaid internships with a paying side gig for a company like Uber or Instacart.

“While big cities typically provide more internship opportunities, many on-demand jobs are now available on college campuses as well as big cities,” said Brandon Yahn, founder of Student Loans Guy. “This allows students to take research jobs on campus as internships while still making money.”

“We see a surge in dog walker applications from college students and even school teachers who find themselves with an abundance of time for the summer months,” said Dave Comiskey, co-founder of Barkly Pets. “The job provides time outside, rewarding time spent with adorable pets, and offers more freedom and flexibility than other summer jobs may.”

And the pay is impressive: an average of $18 per half-hour walk.

But more than good pay, it appears young people want good hours. Or, more specifically: the ability to choose them on a whim.

Related: Seven Ways Millennials Are Changing the Workplace for the Better

""Flexibility in shifts and schedules is super attractive to this [younger] workforce,"" said Peter Harrison, CEO of the job search engine website Snagajob. “Whole Foods is losing money to Instacart — which pays less and provides fewer benefits and security — all because the workers prize that flexibility.”

Some employers feel that teenagers are turning their nose up at their recruiting efforts, opting instead for something easier, even if it pays less.

Jared Beckstead, marketing coordinator for Bailey's Moving and Storage, says that his company is desperate for workers during the summer — the business’ busiest time of year — and is keen on hiring teens and college kids. Unfortunately, it’s “almost impossible to find students willing to do the work,” Beckstead told NBC News.

“I would argue that the need for summer help at many businesses is alive and well; the disappearing act has been the work ethic of today’s youth,” Beckstead said, adding that teenage job candidates typically are ""willing to work for less money and fewer hours just because the job is easier.""

Snagajob’s Harrison says he hears this sentiment loud and clear from a variety of companies.

“All of our companies who do seasonal hires, especially in places like Martha's Vineyard, are having a fantastically hard time filling jobs,” Harrison said.

Many teens have the luxury of chasing the dream internship, even if it doesn’t pay — or of hustling with an on-demand gig that gives them freedom. Others may choose to forego work altogether because, as Snagajob’s Harrison points out, “there is a growing acceptance of insane student debt as part of the college process — a restaurant job can only chip away at the edges of it.”

But what about the families who need paychecks coming in from all eligible members? Or the parents of teens living at home who simply want their kid to take whatever job she can get if only to learn the importance of good work ethic?

""​Most parents realize that by coddling their kids and not exposing them to responsibility, both financial and otherwise, they are doing their kids a disservice,"" said Allison Farber Cheston, career expert and job search coach. ""Employers have no patience for young employees who focus most on what the organization can do for them. I spend a lot of time with millennials explaining the importance of humility and hard work.​""

It’s crucial to note that while the summer job isn’t what it used to be, it absolutely still exists and can be just as valuable as an internship down the road.

Related: Five Millennial Jobs that Parents Will Never Understand

""There are a couple of fields where teens can get paid from the start and will acquire good carryover skills for real jobs,” said Cheston. “Those are sales and customer service: Both of those functions will take them out of their comfort zone and teach them how money is made or how to deal with difficult people — excellent skills for real life and work.”

Another classic summer job that can teach valuable skills? Camp counseling. Some programs now combine pay and college credits.

""A college-aged person can work on accounting and payroll at a camp while earning college credits and getting paid,” said Susie Lupert, executive director of the American Camp Association of NY and NJ, adding that it may not be too late to find such a job in your area. “There are always a few last-minute dropouts or staff members who weren’t the right fit, so hires do occur at this time of year for a few positions.”

Not only can more traditional jobs impress hiring managers or admissions counselors in the future, some are affiliated with scholarship programs.

The Chick Evans Scholarship, for instance, has provided full college scholarships to over 11,000 high schoolers who’ve worked as golf caddies in the U.S and Canada.

""Currently, 935 Evans Scholars are enrolled at 20 universities, and more than 10,400 young men and women have graduated as Evans Scholars,” said John Kaczkowski, president and CEO of the Western Golf Association and Evans Scholars Foundation. “This year, 270 students from across the country and Canada were awarded the Evans Scholarship [which comprises] a full, four-year housing and tuition scholarship for teens.”

One of the requirements to qualify the scholarship? “Outstanding character.” And we all know what best builds that. Why, hard work, of course.",mainstream,M0cf59,big.foot

941,"Toenail fungus is pretty gross, and so it seems to follow that Jublia's Big J toenail boxing character is a bit unsavory, too.

When the purple-hat wearing big toe debuted during the 2015 Super Bowl, an AOL story claimed that ""Jublia quite literally put its grossest foot forward during its Super Bowl ad, in which a cartoon foot hit the field to tackle its bitter enemy, toenail fungus. It was certainly a far cry from the mix of racy and emotional ads we all expected, and the fungus among us got people talking--and gagging--on Twitter.""

That consumer disdain showed in the ratings, with the ad ranking as the second-worst in the game, according to USA Today's Ad Meter, garnering only a 3.22 rating on its 1-10 scale.

The Valeant ($VRX) drug was approved last June; it was acquired by Valeant through its purchase of Dow Pharmaceutical Sciences in 2008. Big J made its debut in the first ""Fight it, Don't Hide it"" TV spot for the drug last fall. The $4.5 million one-spot Super Bowl ad then kicked off the ongoing 2015 campaign.

In the series of ads, Big J changes hats depending on the occasion, donning boxing headgear for the first fight, a helmet for Super Bowl football, a visor for tennis--which aired around the U.S. Open, featuring commentator ex-pro John McEnroe--and a top hat for post-Emmy TV commercials that also featured actor Mario Lopez.

Valeant declined to answer queries for this article, but EVP Ari Kellen spoke at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference before last year's Super Bowl, saying the drug is off to a great start with 150 reps directly working the brand, along with the DTC campaign. The marketing money will continue to flow ""as long as the growth trajectory continues and the economic returns justify it,"" Kellen said at the conference.

Of course, turning off chip-and-dip eaters during the big game doesn't mean the Big J character hasn't done its job. Sales, as Kellen noted, have been brisk; Valeant quarterly reports show Jublia pulled in $270 million in revenue in the first three quarters of 2015. -- Beth Snyder Bulik

43,"If you thought going to Facebook Jail for posting “hate speech” was bad – and it is – here’s a tip: do not move to China. The government there has been controlling what users can see and do online for years. For those who value human rights, the situation is getting worse at an accelerating pace.

With the help from certain high-tech giants, the country promises to lead the world in becoming the first actual Orwellian surveillance state.

In May 2010, the Communist Chinese government issued its first white paper regarding what it called “a crystallization of human wisdom” – the internet.

The white paper acknowledges the usefulness and importance of advancing this digital science and technology. It “energetically advocates and actively supports the development and application of the Internet across the country.”

The white paper guarantees that citizens will enjoy a free press and freedom of speech on the internet:

“The Chinese government encourages and supports the development of Internet news communication undertakings, provides the public with a full range of news, and at the same time guarantees the citizens’ freedom of speech on the Internet as well as the public’s right to know, to participate, to be heard and to oversee in accordance with the law.”

This is where the white paper reveals the “gotcha” clause: the Chinese policy uses “the law” to control online communications. Now we know that this law is targeting the very things the white paper promised would be given: unhindered access to World Wide Web news and social media internet sites for both residents and foreign users:

“The Chinese government will stick to the basic principle of administering the Internet in accordance with the law, try to follow the nature and law of development of the Internet in the light of the national conditions, and promote the scientific development of the Internet with effective administration so as to contribute to the development of the Internet worldwide.”

In 2011, China began requiring internet companies to sign a “Public Pledge of Self-Regulation and Professional Ethics for China Internet Industry” which purported to regulate the “patriotic observance of law, equitableness, trustworthiness and honesty.”

Signers accused of violating the state-mandated pledge to uphold the nation’s laws would be subject to review by the Internet Society of China. If found guilty, such a company could have it “membership” (read: authorization to do business) revoked.

Since Xi Jinping became China’s Communist Party leader in November of 2012, media censorship has flourished. In February 2016, the Chinese president toured the top three state-run media outlets. His message: you must swear absolute loyalty to the Party and follow the Party line in “thought, politics, and action.”

Xi was completely candid about what the online service companies were in business to do – serve the state by dishing out distorted information:

“The media run by the party and the government are the propaganda fronts and must have the party as their family name.”

Xi told tech workers that “All the work by the party’s media must reflect the party’s will, safeguard the party’s authority, and safeguard the party’s unity.”

Freedom House published in its findings on “Freedom on the Net 2016” that internet freedom “around the world declined in 2016 for the sixth consecutive year” with China leading the way for the second year in a row. President Xi’s “information security” policy was proving effective in providing both surveillance and censorship.

Another effect observed was an increase in self-policing while surfing the net:

“Dozens of prosecutions related to online expression have increased self-censorship, as have legal restrictions introduced in 2015.”

Since 2011, the Chinese state-operated telecom company Tencent has been subsidizing and regulating the nation’s largest social media site, called WeChat. With over a thousand million users – that’s one billion as reckoned in American English – WeChat is a primary source for news and views, just like its American social media counterparts Twitter and Facebook.

Critics of WeChat say it promotes “the spread of sensationalist falsehoods.”

In June 2018, a new WeChat in-app feature lets users validate news items by consulting – guess who? – WeChat employees (or volunteers) who perform the fact-checking.

One very clever ploy over at WeChat is a “Top Ten Rumors” category. The government systematically debunks leading consumer education topics such as health and safety, product recalls, and scams as fake news. Here are two examples of state-driven information control:
• An article told people to stop using microwave ovens because microwaved food gives people cancer (false).
• Chinese currency can be scanned in the app QQ to see if they are counterfeit (also false).

WeChat even has a Google-like “WeChat rumor debunking assistant” which 300,000 people consult daily.

This is all well and good but observers point out that Chinese online censors have the power to delete any and all unsavory, anti-state, and illegal articles before anyone else can view them. This form of censorship pre-empts any fact-checking since there are no facts to check.

Weibo is an online service that has been called the Chinese Twitter. The micro-blogging platform enables the government to anticipate and counteract planned protests through monitoring all communications (just like the NSA in the United States).

Between Weibo snooping and WeChat censorship, a new generation of Chinese citizens is growing up ignorant of significant historical events that have been scrubbed from the official narrative. Any private or group chat conversation that mentions Tiananmen Square, Tibet or the Falun Gong (a forbidden religious group) is banned. The user is not notified that their message was never sent.

An uneasy feeling is growing as we in the west have watched China roll out its social credit score system, spy eyeglasses, and flocks – that is, fleets – of flying surveillance doves.

China is racing ahead in the technology game, all for the sake of Communism and totalitarian statism. There is evidence they hacked Hillary Clinton’s emails. And they added a spy chip to thousands of computers that were purchased by top U.S. companies.

Now, U.S. tech giant Google is going ahead with its contract to develop a customized, censored version of the search engine to help China perfect its internet chokehold. Google employees with a conscience and a clue are quitting rather than support the Communist regime.

Things are bad in China and we predict they will only get worse. Even more disturbing is the thought that other countries are also quietly following China’s lead.

Will China create the blueprint for New World Order domination through state-directed propaganda, censorship, and surveillance? And what, if anything, can the rest of us do about it?",conspiracy,C00a83,big.foot; cancer; new.world.order
885,"Polish Government Confirms Discovery Of Nazi “Gold Train”, Warns It May Be Booby-Trapped

Last weekend we reported that in the past month two men, a Pole and German, claimed to have discovered the legendary Nazi “gold train” – a 150 meter long German train alleged to be full of gold, gems and weapons, which disappeared just before the end of World War II – in the proximity of the Polish town of Walbrzych, close to where the Nazi are said to have loaded up the train with valuables for its final voyage in the town of Wroclaw, just as the Soviet forces approached in 1945.

As we detailed, the train is said to have been entombed in the vast tunnel labyrinth located close to Ksiaz castle, which served as Nazi headquarters during World War II…

… and specifically, was said to be located at the foot of the Sowa mountain, in the woods three miles outside the town of Walbrych.

The “gold train” is said to be located under this hill

While many were skeptical that the mystical Nazi treasure train had been finally discovered after many years of searching, an official update last Friday by the Polish government suggested that that may indeed be the case. As the Mail reported on Friday, a representative of the Polish culture ministry, Poland’s National Heritage and Conservation Officer Piotr Zuchowski, said that the man who helped hide the train had revealed its location shortly before he died, and that proof of the train has been observed on radar.

Zuchowski added that “Information about where this train is and what its contents are were revealed on the deathbed of a person who had knowledge of the secret of this train.’ He added that Polish authorities had now seen evidence of the train’s existence in a picture taken using a ground-penetrating radar. He said the image – albeit blurred – showed the shape of a train platform and cannons.

Mr Zuchowski said the find was ‘unprecedented’, adding: ‘We do not know what is inside the train. ‘Probably military equipment but also possibly jewellery, works of art and archive documents.

‘Armored trains from this period were used to carry extremely valuable items and this is an armored train, it is a big clue.’ He said authorities were now ’99 percent sure the train exists’ and whatever is on it will be returned to the rightful owners, if they can be found. ‘We will be 100 per cent sure only when we find the train,’ Mr Zuchowski added.

The train found in the mountains is an ‘armored train’ which looks similar to the one pictured

Mr Zuchowski told reporters that the train was about 100 metres long but added: ‘It is not possible to disclose the exact location of where the train can be found. Still, he noted cryptically that “The local government in Walbrzych knows where it is.”

He explained it is hidden along a 4km stretch of track on the Wroclaw-Walbrzych line.

Mr Zuchowski said the person who claimed he helped load the gold train in 1945 said in a ‘deathbed statement’ the train is secured with explosives. The official declined to comment further about the man who said this but speculation is now rife that it was a former SS guard or a local Pole who stumbled upon the train before hiding it.

Deputy Mayor of Walbrzych, Zygmunt Nowaczyk told the press: ‘The city is full of mysterious stories because of its history. ‘Now it is formal information – we have found something.’

Key excerpts from the press conference by the Polish official can be seen on the Euronews clip below:

The confirmation of the discovery unleashed a surge of treasury hunters, and forced the Polish government to warn the population to stop looking because it could be booby-trapped and dangerous. Zuchowski said “foragers” have become active since two people claimed to have discovered the train last week and urged eager fortune-hunters to stop searching, saying they risk injury or death.

Zuchowski adds that “there may be hazardous substances dating from the Second World War in the hidden train, which I’m convinced exists. I am appealing to people to stop any such searches until the end of official procedures leading to the securing of the find. There’s a huge probability that the train is booby-trapped.’

If anything, tthese warnings are sure to unleash an even more aggressive wave of seekers now that the train’s existience has been confirmed, and the government is actually warning seekers to be careful in their search.

But perhaps what is more interesting is just what the discovery, which would be straight out of an Indiana Jones sequel, will contain, and whether someone already got to the precious cargo over the past 7 decades. The answer should be made public shortly.

1248,"Anyone seeking ultimate proof of the existence of Bigfoot should head south. In Texas, it is legal to shoot and kill this legendary giant ape, known in other parts of the world as Sasquatch or Yeti, which has never been discovered.

According to an official with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission, Bigfoot isn't listed as an endangered species, so you're free to kill as many as you want.

""If the Commission does not specifically list an indigenous, nongame species, then the species is considered nonprotected nongame wildlife,"" David Sinclair, direction of the law enforcement division at Texas Parks and Wildlife, wrote in an email response to a curious Bigfoot believer. ""A nonprotected nongame animal may be hunted on private property with landowner consent by any means, at any time and there is no bag limit or possession limit.""

John Lloyd Sharf of Salem, Ore., contacted Texas Parks and Wildlife to inquire whether Bigfoot was protected in Texas. As one of the 29 percent of Americans who believe Bigfoot inhabits the country's remote woodland areas and is just really difficult to find, Sharf was apparently motivated by the concern that the as-yet-undiscovered creature could face extermination in the state.

""So, it is the case all individuals of an unknown species … could be exterminated without criminal or civil repercussions — essentially causing extinction ?"" Sharf said he replied to Sinclair. At Cryptomundo, a popular ""cryptozoology"" discussion forum and blog, Bigfoot believers are forming a plan of action to deal with what they see as the potentially disastrous outcome of this loophole in the Texas hunting laws, which would allow Bigfoot to be hunted to extinction before a living specimen could be studied. [ Hunter Captures UFO in Nevada ]

""I would advocate a small group of trained hunters, under close supervision and observing all necessary safety precautions shooting a SINGLE individual to provide a type specimen,"" wrote a user who goes by the name AreWeThereYeti. ""Then, once the existence of Sasquatch was proven, immediate steps could be taken to attach an endangered/protected status to both the species and its habitat.""

712,"Brian McBride was the sort of kid who lived life in perpetual motion. So the moment he put foot to soccer ball at age 8, he knew he’d met his match in sports. He slept with his soccer ball; he dribbled up and down the stairs in his home in Arlington Heights, Ill., driving his mother nuts. “I played soccer like a madman,” he says.

Although he may have his indoor-dribbling problem under control, McBride, 29, still has that same passion. A striker for professional soccer’s Columbus Crew, he’s often called the Michael Jordan of the U.S. game for his gravity-defying airborne maneuvers. His talents go on worldwide display June 5, when the U.S. team takes on Portugal in its first game of the World Cup, the monthlong international soccer orgy, in South Korea and Japan.

This is not the first time around on the world pitch for the 6’1″ McBride. He scored America’s only goal in the ’98 competition in France. “It was just an awesome feeling,” says McBride. (As in France, the U.S. is expected to be KO’d early in Korea.) And McBride remains a bright spot. “We don’t have another player with his capabilities,” says ESPN lead soccer analyst Ty Keough. “He’s taken what God gave him and made the most out of it.”

Yet he’s had to overcome his share of challenges. In September of 2000, while McBride was spending the off-season with an English soccer franchise, he noticed a sudden, dramatic swelling in his armpit after a game. It turned out to be thoracic outlet syndrome, a rare disorder in which compression of the blood vessels causes dangerous blood clots. Though the condition was not life-threatening, it put his career in jeopardy. Doctors performed surgery to dissipate the clot, and after two months he was back on the field. In August 2001 he developed another painful clot in his right arm. This time surgeons removed a rib to relieve pressure on McBride’s veins. “I have never seen anyone quite so sick,” Maddie McBride Bisulca, 56, recalls of her son, who has since recovered so completely that doctors say the disorder will not recur. “He was so courageous and strong.”

But he was not quite ready to quit the sport he adored. His brother Matt remembers visiting him in a Denver hospital and trying to cheer him up. “If you never play another day,” Matt told him, “everything will still be fine.” The attempt at comfort was met with heart-wrenching silence. “You could see it come over his face,” says Matt. “He was just very sad.”

McBride is the rambunctious second of three children Maddie had with husband Matthew, an advertising sales representative (whom she divorced when Brian was 4). “If I didn’t keep the doors padlocked, then he always would find a way to run outside,” says Maddie, who raised the kids on her own, often holding down three jobs. “He just never liked to be still.”

He was also a natural on the field. After stellar high school and college careers—he was a two-time All-American at Saint Louis University—he landed a professional gig in Wolfsburg, Germany, where he was disappointed to find that many of his fellow players treated the sport he loved as a mere occupation. “You weren’t supposed to be happy,” he says. “You were supposed to be doing your job.”

He was thrilled to return to the U.S., where in 1996 the Crew picked him as the first player in the fledgling Major League Soccer’s inaugural draft. Turns out his bout with illness was also an opportunity of sorts. Recuperating from his first surgery back in Arlington Heights, he ran into Dina Barnett, a childhood acquaintance who was going through a divorce. “He was the most caring and loving person I’d ever met,” she recalls of their first meeting. Last February they married, making McBride stepfather to Dina’s daughter Ashley, nearly 2.

Fully recovered, McBride relishes being a dad, but with the heavy travel schedule of his pro team as well as the U.S. national team, he gets only limited time with the family. Still, he is getting back a little bit of what he dished out as a kid. “Ashley’s so active—she’s always running around,” he says. “But if she wants to learn soccer, I’ll help.”",mainstream,M132b8,big.foot
123,"In the 12th century, foot binding had become much more widespread, and by the early Qing Dynasty (in the mid-17th century), every girl who wished to marry had her feet bound. The only people who didn't bind their feet were the very poor, ethnic Hakka people, and women who worked in fishing because they had needed to have normal feet in order to balance themselves on boats.

At what age did girls get their feet bound? What did the practice entail?



 Girls would have their feet bound between the ages of four and six; any younger, the girls couldn't endure the pain, and by the time they were older than six their feet had already grown too large. Four to six was the ideal age because you could reason with the girls and help them deal with the pain. Foot binding would occur in a ritualistic ceremony accompanied by other traditions intending to ward of bad luck.

The procedure entailed bending the girls' toes underneath the sole, using very long ribbons to wrap their feet all the way to the ankle. Basically, the idea was to keep breaking the foot whenever it grew too large, a process that usually took between two and three years. Then the feet would be bound for the rest of the girl's life.

The girls, naturally, developed a peculiar way of walking—almost as if they had hooves. And in order to facilitate moving around, women with bound feet developed strong muscles in their hips, thighs, and buttocks, so much so that these characteristics were considered physically attractive to the Chinese men of the era.

When did foot binding go out of favor?

In the 19th century, toward the end of the Qing Dynasty, Western countries effectively colonized China and many Western people began to move to the country. This coincided with the height of foot binding, when the practice was most prevalent. So many Western women, especially the wives of Christian missionaries, became strong advocates against the practice, producing pamphlets and even opening shelters in support of afflicted women. Around the same time, Chinese intellectuals who had studied abroad in Europe and in North America returned to China and stated their support for abolishment. So by the time Pearl Buck was writing in 1923, after the Qing Dynasty had fallen, the practice had become unfashionable.

This change in fashion suddenly had a perverse side effect: a lot of girls who had had their feet bound in order to become marriageable suddenly found themselves abandoned by their husbands because foot binding was no longer fashionable. Worse, in bigger cities some people would catch women with bound feet and cut off their bindings, a humiliation because these women would never, ever show their bare feet to anyone—not even their husbands. For them, the process that began with a lot of pain and tears likewise ended with pain and tears.",mainstream,M13335,big.foot
462,"Police in South Carolina are warning cryptozoology enthusiasts who think they've spotted Bigfoot, not to take potshots at the creature.

The Greenville Police Department, in Greenville, South Carolina, posted the tongue-in-cheek warning on its Facebook page on Tuesday morning.

It came the day after a report surfaced about an alleged Bigfoot close encounter in neighboring North Carolina.

The police Facebook post was equal parts poking fun and straight up 'don't shoot!' safety advice for its community.

In the post, police exhorted: 'If you see Bigfoot, please do not shoot at him/her, as you'll most likely be wounding a fun-loving and well-intentioned person, sweating in a gorilla costume.'

The post also stated, tongue-firmly-in-cheek that after having reviewed shaky video of an apparent Bigfoot sighting from 2015, 'we can say with some confidence that proof of Bigfoot still eludes us.'

The police linked to the video, which showed a Yorkie trying to scare off a two-footed, rapidly moving entity in daylight.

The Greenville police's Bigfoot warning went up the day after the Charlotte Observer revealed that a member of a Bigfoot-watching group claimed to have had an encounter with a 'large bipedal animal covered in hair,' on Friday night at about 11pm, in a wooded area in North Carolina's McDowell County.

John Bruner, of Bigfoot 911, reported that at the time of the apparent sighting, he and six others were in the woods, spreading out glow sticks in hopes of attracting Bigfoot's attention.

According to the Charlotte Observer, Bruner wrote in a Facebook post that, 'I turned on my headlamp and saw a large bi-pedal animal covered in hair.' He described the creature as having had a smooth, solid black face and shaggy hair.

Bruner noted that he chased the creature and had a 'stare-down' with it, before it disappeared deeper into the woods.

Bigfoot sighting reports in the Carolinas are common, with multiple reports circulating around Bigfoot enthusiasts Facebook groups and drawing enough attention from professional Bigfoot hunters to warrant filming episodes of TV series in the area.

Laws regarding the shooting of Bigfoot and other similar cryptids vary by state.

Mental Floss reported, for example, that killing Bigfoot is expressly outlawed in Skamania County, Washington, but it's technically legal to hunt and kill one in Texas because the cryptid is not on the state's recognized official species list.",mainstream,M0d7cd,big.foot

737,"Bigfoot and Mineworm sound like cartoon characters. They are, in fact, the names of two mechanical giants designed to make people safer from the estimated 60 million land mines scattered around the world. Working in tandem, the pair destroy mines in ways that are faster and safer � and more ecofriendly and cost-effective � than any system to date.""By the end of this year,"" says inventor Bob French, ""we will have the first two machines in Bosnia-Herzegovina."" There, with the continued assistance of the British government's Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (dera), Bigfoot and Mineworm will help to destroy some of the estimated 1 million mines left over from the 1992-95 war. Mines continue to kill up to 10 people there each month.The idea for Bigfoot and Mineworm began in early 1997, when Leicestershire-based French watched a television report of the Princess of Wales' trip to central Angola. As Diana inspected a minefield, wearing a flak jacket and face shield, French's eye was drawn to those working nearby. ""People were poking sticks in the ground,"" he recalls, using the same mine-clearance methods he saw during his Royal Air Force service decades earlier, in Borneo and Sarawak.""Mines are unsophisticated weapons and they need an unsophisticated method of dealing with them,"" says French, who has a broad industrial background in electronics. After research and consultation with mine clearers, he concluded that two remote-controlled and camera-equipped machines were needed. The first, Bigfoot, has piston-driven armored feet that stamp every square centimeter of ground that the machine passes over, detonating any mines. Bigfoot has no need of minefield maps, and its system of shock absorption, blast deflection and energy dissipation prevents damage from antipersonnel devices. If larger, antitank mines damage one of the feet, a replacement can be installed in the field.Trailing in Bigfoot's wake, Mineworm excavates up to 55 cm of soil. It removes and crushes all unexploded ordnance, including faulty mines, sorts out ferrous metal for further inspection and � unlike its heavier military predecessors � returns noncompacted soil to the ground, allowing crop planting and growth. Having passed initial tests in the U.K., the 5-ton prototypes of French's Land Mine Disposal System (LMDS) are being fined-tuned to make them smaller so they can be more easily transported and maneuvered on country roads and bridges. After a three-month field trial in Bosnia � in which teams of mine clearers using dogs will follow the machines to verify that nothing is missed � they are expected to remain at work there. ""It's pretty certain that the prototype does what Bob says it will,"" says Colin Lowe, project manager for dera's Countermine Warfare Research Team, which oversaw two weeks of trials on sandy hills, clay soil and mud in England. ""No one machine is going to clear the world of mines,"" says Lowe, but French's system takes a ""golf-bag approach,"" using different tools for different tasks on different terrains. Pat Banks, an independent land mines consultant working in Bosnia � where fewer than 60 sq km were cleared last year � considers the machines ""absolutely essential."" Depending on terrain, they can clear up to 500 sq m in an hour; a human team could cover perhaps 200 sq m in a day.Initial development funds for French's prototypes came from a business friend, Rupert King. Today, the LMDS is supported by Redbus Investments, set up in 1998 by entrepreneur Cliff Stanford. ""This British solution to a global tragedy is testament to the wealth of innovation that exists in this country,"" Stanford says. ""We now need governments and aid agencies to come on board and get Bigfoot and Mineworm in the field."" Given the speed at which the LMDS can clear mines, French argues, international donors such as the European Union, the U.S. and Canada ""would get more for their aid dollars."" The cost of the two machines � plus attachments, spare parts, training and field support � would be about $750,000 in the first year, he says, but then would drop to about $300,000.While Bigfoot and Mineworm are being prepared for Bosnia, French is making his own plans. He wants to play football with local children in a field that his machines have made safe. Even farther down that unmined road, he says, he'd like to go out of business � in a world that no longer has any land mines.",mainstream,M0d42c,big.foot
532,"It was hailed as ""definitive evidence"" that Bigfoot existed. The discovery of ""something large, hairy and frozen in ice"" in woods in America by a heroic police officer made international headlines and attracted interest from a team who have been earnestly searching for the legendary ape-like beast for years.

They purchased the remains for an undisclosed fee and set about the delicate process of thawing the body. So it is hard to imagine just how disappointing it must have been to discover, not Sasquatch, but a rubber gorilla suit.

Steve Kulls, of Squatchdetective.com and host of Squatchdetective Radio, revealed the bad news: Matt Whitton, a police officer on leave after being shot while on duty, and Rick Dyer, a former Georgia corrections officer, had achieved fame on a global scale with a hoax of breathtaking transparency.

As they held a much publicised press conference in California on 15 August about their alleged discovery in the wooded hills of Georgia, near a remote region where sightings of the creature are often reported, Whitton had insisted: ""Everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words.""

The pair, who were offering weekend Bigfoot tracking expeditions for about £250, described the creature as a 7ft 7in, male, weighing over 560lb (255kg), with huge human-like feet and reddish hair.

Hundreds of thousands watched videos of the remains posted on YouTube. People started to believe.

Mr Kulls said: ""A police officer of seven years, on medical leave, labelled as a hero for being wounded in the line of duty, got up in front of the world and told the world of how he and Mr Dyer uncovered this creature,"" he said.

""On August 16, the freezer containing the alleged corpse arrived with the Searching For Bigfoot Team.

""The ice was being thawed slowly without aid, to prevent any decomposition of the alleged corpse. We estimated that the freezer and its contents weighed over 1,500lbs and it would take several days or longer to thaw completely.

""The following day we were up early to discover that some hair was now exposed. I extracted some from the alleged corpse, examined it and had some concerns.""

The team decided to burn a sample which they said ""melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair"".

""We began an expedited melting process. Within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head... I was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm, but unusually hollow in one small section. This was yet another ominous sign,"" Mr Kulls said.

""Within the next hour of thaw, a break appeared up near the feet area. As the team and I began examining this area near the feet, I observed the foot which looked unnatural, reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot.

""Later that day, we were informed that Mr Whitton and Mr Dyer had admitted it was a costume.""

Phone calls to Whitton and Dyer went unreturned yesterday, but a voicemail recording for their Bigfoot Tip Line, which also proclaims they are searching for leprechauns and the Loch Ness monster, has been updated with the information about a new search for ""big cats and dinosaurs"".

""If you see any of those, give us a call,"" it says.",mainstream,M0d1dc,big.foot
723,"Marion, North Carolina (CNN) A huge crowd of people had gathered on the lawn of the McDowell County Courthouse Saturday when an ape-like creature in a T-shirt bounded through the cheering onlookers and joined Marion Mayor Steve Little on stage.

""This morning I have this special proclamation,"" Little said, holding up a document with his signature and a gold seal at the bottom. He read aloud.

""I do hereby proclaim today, Saturday, September 8, 2018, that Bigfoot is the official animal of the city of Marion, North Carolina,"" Little said, as the costumed Bigfoot clapped enthusiastically.

Thus began the inaugural Western North Carolina Bigfoot Festival in this town near the Blue Ridge Mountains about 40 miles east of Asheville.

Mayor Steve Little presented Bigfoot with a declaration naming him Marion's official animal for the day.

Converging on Marion were thousands of believers and skeptics alike, united in their celebration of a cryptozoological mystery that has fascinated people for decades.

""Bigfoot is real,"" said festival organizer John Bruner, ""and we want to bring awareness to that and bring more people to the table to get this mystery solved.""

Bruner is part of something called the Bigfoot 911 research team, which investigates purported Bigfoot sightings and evidence. He has lived in Marion all his life and said he decided to stage the festival after the town's business association approached him with the idea.

""And, at the same time,"" he added, ""we want to have fun and fellowship with our fellow citizens and our visitors.""

If you ignored the Bigfoot T-shirts, the Bigfoot artwork and the occasional costumed Bigfoot, the festival seemed like any a small Southern city might hold at the tail end of summer.

The day started with a 5K before three blocks of downtown Marion's Main Street were closed to vehicles for the day. Vendors from North Carolina and beyond sold everything from knit hats to jewelry. There was barbecue, Chick-fil-A, funnel cakes, shaved ice and plenty of beer for parents who sought refuge in the shade as their kids frolicked in bouncy houses.

The legendary Bigfoot -- or Sasquatch, if you prefer -- is most commonly associated with the Pacific Northwest. But sightings have been reported all over North America -- including in Marion, said Little, who has lived in the town for decades.

Folks around this town of 7,500 report one or two sightings a year, he said.

""For years there were people who would talk about, 'Oh, I saw a great big old footprint out in the woods — it's bigger than a coyote, and it wasn't a bear.'""

'Do you believe it?'

Bruner's fellow Bigfoot researchers set up a tent with evidence they'd spent years gathering. All day people waited in line to examine photographs, video footage, audio recordings and casts of purported Bigfoot feet and hands.

Researcher Lee Woods, who has spent a decade chasing Bigfoot, displayed two casts. The first was a massive foot, 14 inches long and 7 inches wide. The other was less identifiable. It looked sort of like a clump of plaster and pine straw, with what appeared to be an extra toe.

""It's either 6 toes, which is a deformity, or it's a hand, and that's the knuckles,"" said Woods, pointing.

""He's knuckle-dragging,"" he explained. ""They walk upright, but they will drop on all fours and knuckle-drag like a gorilla, and then stand up and take off.""

At a nearby table, researcher Tim Dills displayed a series of photos he captured on trail cameras set up in the woods. One appeared to be a picture of brush, but Dills pointed to what he said was a face in the foliage.

Two men studied the photos before walking away.

""Well, do you believe it?"" one asked.

""Not yet,"" his companion replied.

Sitting on a curb nearby was Colby Wollack, who said he definitely considers himself a believer. ""There's too much land out there, and there's so much evidence,"" he said.

His wife, Monica Fortenberry, couldn't help but crack a smile. She was skeptical.

""There's just no way that there is something of this size out in the woods anywhere,"" she said. ""It's either a bear, or it's not.""

Between them was Monica's brother, Montgomery. He doesn't quite believe in Bigfoot — the evidence didn't convince him — but said he considers himself an ""enthusiast.""

""I think it's a great hobby and I think people should keep doing it whether they believe in it or not,"" he said. ""I like the idea of it, even if it's never proven. I think it's still a good story.""

In the afternoon, throngs of festivalgoers regrouped on the courthouse lawn for what organizers dubbed a ""town hall.""

But instead of discussing municipal issues, one Bigfoot believer after another stood up to share stories of their encounters.

One person mentioned seeing an aging Bigfoot whose fur was graying. Another shared an account of seeing a female Bigfoot and her baby dash into the woods at around 30 mph. Multiple people mentioned ""yellow eyes"" and a foul odor akin to the scent of a dead animal.

Still others described hearing a roar.

""It wasn't a growl and it wasn't a scream,"" one person said. ""More like a guttural, gibberish thing.""

""You're looking at something that don't exist,"" said a man from Virginia.

A few folks who shared their stories said it took years for them to screw up the courage to tell anyone about their Bigfoot sightings for fear of appearing ""crazy.""

""But I know what I heard,"" a woman told the crowd. ""I know what I smelled, and I know how it made me feel.""

The lawn was a judgment-free zone. Many people in the crowd wore T-shirts professing their faith in Sasquatch's existence.

""Gone Squatchin,"" some shirts said (Yes, that's a verb, as in: to ""squatch,"" the act of looking for Bigfoot). Some declared Bigfoot the Hide and Seek World Champion, while others flipped the tables, saying, ""Bigfoot saw me but nobody believes him.""

Still others bore a simple directive: ""Believe.""

But when one man stood up to share his story and asked how many believers were in the crowd, only about half raised their hands.

Many of the researchers said they are used to doubters, and it doesn't necessarily bother them.

""I totally respect their opinions,"" Bruner said. ""I respect the fact that they don't believe, and I just want them to respect the fact that I do.""

Other researchers said they encourage skeptics to go out into the woods and search for evidence themselves, because they'll never find it on a computer.

One Bigfoot researcher, Daniel Hurst, said he appreciates skeptics because they force him to be diligent in his work.

""They're a very positive thing for us, actually,"" he said, raising his voice to combat the sound of a generator fired up nearby. ""For those of us who are in the business for legitimacy, (skeptics) keep us honest.""

One group of non-believers said they were just at the festival to have a good time and to enjoy the company of people who were passionate about something. That was something they could appreciate, they said.

As recordings of purported Bigfoot calls bellowed from the evidence tent, Micah Loving explained he's a fan of the mystery of Bigfoot and understands why the researchers are excited. But mainly, he said, squatchin' is something fun to do with your friends.

""You drink beers and you have fun and you might hear something and you might scream out into the woods and get a reaction maybe from some other creature — most likely not a Bigfoot — but it's tons of fun and it's just the whole hunt,"" he said.

Loving and his friends had just been to the evidence tents and said they weren't persuaded by anything they saw.

They chuckled as a member of their group, Andrea York, addressed a Bigfoot call that was reverberating in the background.

""You can say no other animal makes that sound,"" York said, echoing an assertion from one of the researchers. ""But I'm pretty sure I had a He-Man action figure that made that sound.""

There may be a broad divide between Bigfoot skeptics and believers. But on this day you couldn't tell.

Festivalgoers were all smiles at the Bigfoot calling contest, where laughter and applause greeted the brave people who yawped into a microphone, doing their best to mimic a Bigfoot cry. One contestant actually got down on one knee and proposed to his girlfriend as the crowd broke out in raucous cheers.

People danced on the lawn and in the street as a DJ blasted Bruno Mars' ""Treasure"" and Kid Rock's ""All Summer Long."" They took pictures of each other grinning in front of a ""Bigfoot Crossing"" sign at the intersection of South Main and West Court Street.

Despite the heat, a teenage boy dressed in a Sasquatch costume posed for pictures with a little girl. When she burst into tears he took off his mask to comfort her, smiling through the sweat.

""In a world where there's so much bad stuff that's happening, we need some good stuff, too,"" Bruner told CNN.

The entire day felt like an echo of something Mayor Little told festivalgoers that morning at the opening ceremony: It doesn't matter what your gender is, or what your race is, or what your politics are.

""To Bigfoot,"" he said, ""you all taste the same.""",mainstream,M08608,big.foot
63,"Since its release in early 2014, the big-budget movie “Noah” has caused controversy for not being biblically accurate. While that is certainly the case, the movie does more than take liberties with the Bible: “Noah” pushes messages that have nothing to do with the Bible. These messages are actually political and come directly from the world elite. The primary message? Humanity needs to be cleansed … again.

Throughout his movie-making career, Darren Aronofsky has created quite a few controversial movies with a powerful underlying message (see my article on the movie Black Swan here). None of his work can be considered “idiotic” and, despite what critics say, Noah is not an idiotic movie either. Sure, it contains giant stone monsters, primitive bazookas and Noah killing a bunch of poor souls, but the movie is smart enough to effectively communicate several of its core messages, twisting one of the oldest tales in the world to push an agenda that is very 2014.

While many viewers were upset about the many liberties taken in this retelling of Noah’s Ark – a tale that exists in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim literature – the messages added to the story should be even more upsetting. Noah re-formats this ancient tale to describe the basic premise of a new religion, one that has been pushed on the masses for years. Based on the elite’s long-term Agenda of drastically depopulating the Earth, this new religion is about radical environmentalism, the devaluation (and even hatred) of human life, and the re-alignment of morality towards a new axis.

Through its odd narrative, the movie turns the tale of Noah’s Ark into an absurd and disturbing adventure that leads viewers wondering: Why is God so evil? And why is Noah such a jerk? When Noah’s wife asks him if “the Creator” (that’s the name for God in the movie) will help them survive, Noah’s answer is almost comedic, as if he was describing a super-villain:



While the Bible explains that the Great Flood was caused by a mysterious race of Giants corrupting and “infecting” humanity, the movie does not go that route. Instead, it repeatedly tells us that humans are evil and deserve to die.

Before getting into the actual story, I need to point out a detail that is seemingly trivial, but that tells loads about the movie’s true goal: Why is everybody dressed as if they got their clothes from the world’s first Zara store?

These made-for-a-2014-audience outfits basically tell us that Noah is not about the Bible – it is about today. It is a message to humanity right now, directly from the elite.

While the premise of Noah is based on the Biblical story from the book of Genesis, the creators invented characters, subplots, symbols, images, and messages to completely reshape the tale, giving it a twisted, disturbing and wholly “unspiritual” meaning. Even if one watches the movie fully expecting a “creative retelling” of Noah’s Ark, it is difficult to not be disturbed by the bloody, violent, near-psychopathic tangent taken by the main character. I mean, Noah actually kills a bunch of people in the movie! How can that remotely make sense in the divine context of the story? Well, it actually does make sense … when we understand that the movie is meant to sell a new religion dictated by the world elite composed of values it wants the masses to adopt. One of these values is that human life is cancer on Earth that needs to be eradicated. In other words, they want humans to sincerely believe they are evil to justify depopulation. Of course, as the movie tells us, most humans do die … EXCEPT those of the chosen bloodline. And that is what the elite wants us to think. We must all die to save the Earth … except them.

Noah is strikingly similar to another movie analyzed on Vigilant Citizen: 2012. As I noted in this article, 2012 is a disaster movie that is essentially about the rich and powerful people (the elite) surviving a gigantic flood while everyone else dies. The movie was full of references to the tale of Noah’s Ark and even shows helicopters transporting various animals to giant ships. The movie posters of Noah and 2012 are also strikingly similar.

Noah is, therefore, a reconstitution of a biblical story tailor-made to fit the Agenda continually being pushed by the elite … and as usual, the Agenda is rather upsetting. It promotes the idea of massively depopulating the Earth and sells it as an ecological mission. Extreme environmentalism is the new religion being sold to the masses through fear.

This religion is not only promoted in works of fiction, it is found in real life monuments. The Georgia Guidestones is a gigantic collection of stones (dubbed America’s Stonehenge) on which are laid out ten NEW commandments.

In the article I wrote about the Guidestones, I explain that it was built by members of occult secret societies. The last commandment of the stones sums up the main message of the movie Noah:

In Noah, it is explained that humanity needs to be extinct because it is disrespectful to nature. That is not what is said in the Bible, but that is the message this movie (and the elite) wants you to absorb.

Right from the first scenes of the movie, Noah (dressed in his little Zara outfit) talks to his kids about hardcore environmental concepts that were probably the last thing on people’s minds in these very ancient times. When Noah’s son sees a pretty flower and tries to pick it, Noah jumps in to stop the senseless destruction.

That little scene announces Noah’s rather extreme brand of environmentalism. A little later, Noah sees “men” (a pejorative term in the movie) hunting an animal in order to eat it. Noah runs to the rescue of the animal and stabs one of the men in the leg. He then calls his act of violence “justice”. Yes, Noah is apparently an extreme vegan who stabs people who eat meat.

When Noah’s son asks him why these evil men believe that eating meat gives them strength, he replies:

This, of course, is not found in the Bible. It is part of the movie’s message that basically says “Animals > Humans”. Throughout the movie, Noah refers to animals as “the innocent” while humans are perceived as scum who deserve to die. Noah, however, seems to forget that many animals are carnivorous beasts who spend most of their time hunting and devouring other animals. Some might say: That is what God intended.

At one point Noah tells his children:

Throughout the movie, Noah, the “hero of the movie” displays absolute hatred for humanity and avoids it at all costs. Every time he sees “men” or man-created structures, he automatically becomes worried.

Twisting the Biblical Bit About the Giants

To further its anti-humanity message, the movie significantly twists and contorts Biblical passages about a mysterious race called the Giants found in the book of Genesis. In the Bible, the Giants are offsprings of a group of 200 “Sons of God” who descended to Earth to mix with humans. They are said to have taught humans advanced skills such as metallurgy, metal working, cosmetics, sorcery, astrology, astronomy, and meteorology. Because the Giants disobeyed God, they were also called the Fallen Angels. (Interesting note: Lucifer is also referred to as a Fallen Angel and is said to have brought forbidden knowledge to men).

In the book of Genesis, it is said that the Giants (also called the Nephilim) were a hybrid race of sons of God and human females.

The Nephilim are described in the Bible (and other apocryphal texts) as a race of giants who lived among humans. They ultimately became a destructive presence and were said to have consumed “all acquisitions of men”. In order to rid these beings from Earth (along with the humans who mixed with them) God caused the Great Flood.

The Bible, therefore, describes the Giants as the main cause of humanity’s corruption. The movie, however, portrays the exact opposite. In Noah, the Giants are described as gentle teachers who came to aid humans, but ultimately became victims of humanity’s cruelty. Later, Giants actually help Noah build the Ark! In short, the movie inverted important parts of the Bible to say that humanity is solely responsible for its demise because it had evolved into a state that was beyond repair. The movie also makes it clear that its anti-humanity message is still applicable today.

In one significant part of the movie, Noah tells his family the “first story he ever heard”. It begins with the first line of the Bible “In the beginning, there was light” but then devolves into a grim speech about the evils of humanity.

The movie, therefore, pushes the viewers to conclude that humanity is, once again, beyond hope. Massive depopulation is therefore not a horrible catastrophe but a necessary “cleansing process”. Noah himself says:

This line is not from the Bible. It comes from the minds of psychopaths who want to depopulate the Earth and describing it as a “cleansing process”. Depopulation is good. Death equals cleansing.

In the end, Noah realizes that not all humanity needs to die after the flood: His family survives. And there lies another important message of the movie: Depopulation does not apply to all humanity. It only applies to those who are not part of the “chosen” bloodline. This is the kind of the message the occult elite wants us to assimilate because they believe THEY are the chosen bloodline.

It’s All About the Bloodline

Spoiler alert: Noah and his family survive the Great Flood. But no one else does. Right from the beginning of the movie, we are told that the survival of humanity must go through a specific bloodline. Viewers immediately learn that Noah descends from Seth while the bad guys descend from Cain – a fact that is apparently VERY important.

Of course, none of this is mentioned in the Bible. It is one of the many fabrications added to flesh out the story and to give it a specific angle: God favors a specific bloodline.

Later in the movie, Noah’s father, Methuselah, is depicted as a reclusive but supernatural being who magically guides Noah through the Creator’s plan. While Methuselah was never mentioned in the Bible as having a role in the construction of the Ark, this addition strengthens the idea of the bloodline.

There are other strange “non-Biblical” additions to the movie that ultimately makes us think that Noah is not a “man of God”, but a jerk who only wants to see his bloodline survive. For instance: Noah actually kills a bunch of people.

In another gut-wrenching (and completely invented) scene, Noah purposely allows his son’s girlfriend to be trampled to death by hundreds of people.

How can a man, that is supposedly chosen by the Creator, allow the death of an innocent girl? Why was this added to the movie? Because it is continuously communicating a message: Whether she was good or not is irrelevant. The girl was not part of the bloodline. Therefore, she must die. It is not about being a good person. It is about who you descend from.

After the flood, Noah turns into a disturbed, depressive, psychopath. When he learns that his daughter-in-law is pregnant, he is convinced that he must kill the little girl to make sure that humanity does not reproduce.

Noah, however, realizes something incredible: He does not feel like stabbing his own granddaughter in the face. Although he first believes that he had let down the Creator by not killing the girl, he ultimately learns that he did the right thing by “showing mercy”. But what about the countless humans he killed? Wasn’t there any mercy for them? No. Because they were not part of the bloodline. The Creator allowed Noah to murder people when they were not “chosen”. Incidentally, that is what the occult elite believes.

The movie depicts Noah’s “divine” quest as a cruel and violent process carried out by a man who is steadily turning into a psychopath. While stranded on the Ark, his own family begins to resent him as he obsesses over the fact that everybody needs to die. While he is merely following the Creator’s orders, he appears to be animated by a deep-seeded hate of humanity, which leaves viewers with an “unholy” feeling. There is, however, a character that counterbalances Noah’s “do it my way or else” doctrine: Tubal-Cain.

Tubal-Cain is the “leader of humans”, and, therefore, Noah’s mortal enemy. While Tubal-Cain is the “bad guy”, he is ironically the character who says the most thoughtful and sensible lines, which causes viewers to somewhat identify with him. Contrarily to Noah, he is not ashamed to be human and is proud of humanity’s accomplishments. Furthermore, he feels somewhat forsaken by the Creator who left his kind to roam a desolate land. He seeks to emancipate himself from the Creator’s rule through his own means. In this sense, he is a representative of a Gnostic point of view that perceives the Creator a demiurge – a lower god who imprisoned mankind in a material world. This is why God is called “the Creator” in the movie. It refers to the Gnostic concept of demiurge, the near-malevolent creator of the material world.

Tubal-Cain is briefly mentioned in the Bible as a “forger of all instruments of bronze and iron” and an “instructor of every artificer in brass and iron”. However, he is never mentioned in the story of the Great Flood and has no link with Noah. So why did the makers of the movie choose this obscure Biblical character to become Noah’s arch-nemesis? Because, while Tubal-Cain is an obscure figure in the Bible, he is an extremely important figure in the most widespread Gnostic Mystery School on Earth: Freemasonry.

Not unlike Hiram Abiff (a leading figure in Masonic lore and ritual), Tubal-Cain is an obscure Biblical figure who takes a great importance in esoteric teachings. As a proficient maker of weapons, he represents humanity’s potential to build its own power – without the Creator. Various Masonic sources describe the esoteric significance of Tubal-Cain.

In Manly P. Hall’s “The Lost Keys of Freemasonry”, Tubal-Cain is described as the “forefather” of Freemasons.

Mystery Schools love Biblical characters who did not rely on God to gain knowledge and power. Tubal-Cain is a prime example. In Noah, Tubal-Cain attempts to communicate with the Creator – not as a servant, like Noah, but as an equal.

Although Tubal-Cain realizes that humanity is about to be wiped away, he finds an unexpected person to carry on his legacy: Noah’s own son, Ham.

Throughout Noah’s quest, Ham feels ignored, rejected and infantilized. He feels that he cannot become a man without being with a woman – a right that is denied by his father. Tired of being punished and humiliated, Ham leaves the Ark and mixes with the “nasty” humans. There, he finds a “good girl” he wants to marry. However, Noah leaves her to die and drags Ham back to the Ark by force.

When Ham meets Tubal-Cain, he finds the kind of father figure he has been looking for. Instead of a life of blind servitude, Tubal-Cain offered Ham the means to be a “real” man. During the flood, Tubal-Cain found a way to sneak inside the Ark and, while hidden with the animals, he “initiated” Ham to his philosophy.

While these words were said by the “bad guy”, he was nearly quoting actual Biblical verses. This only adds to the movie’s general confusion and mixed messages.

Tubal-Cain then ultimately urges Ham to kill his father:

Ham does not kill his father … he kills Tubal-Cain. However, this fateful act does not seem to bother Tubal-Cain. To the contrary, he knows that, by killing him, Ham has successfully completed his initiation. While dying, Tubal-Cain tells Ham:

After surviving the flood, Ham does not reintegrate with Noah’s family. He leaves them behind and makes his own path.

We don’t know if Ham managed to reproduce (probably not). However, we do know that, in the Bible, the story that immediately follows Noah’s Ark is the story of the Tower of Babel – a gigantic tower built by humans to “fight God”. It appears that the Great Flood did not “cleanse” anything and that Tubal-Cain’s lineage survived the Flood after all.

In the Bible, the story of Noah’s Ark is told in a few simple verses and is filled with enigmatic bits that are never explained (i.e. who were the Giants exactly?). The movie Noah fills in the answers to some of these questions in its own way by augmenting the Biblical tale with fabricated stories and characters, ultimately giving this ancient story a very modern twist. The same way Russell Crowe’s snazzy outfits were tailor-made for a 2014 audience, the messages in Noah were also tailor-made for a 2014 audience.

The movie basically presents two philosophical views: One that is meant for the ignorant masses and one that is meant for “those in the know”. The ignorant masses are told to follow a radical brand of environmentalism that leads to self-hatred: Because humanity is the evil force behind war, suffering and the destruction of nature, it needs to be “cleansed”. This message fits with the occult elite’s depopulation Agenda and is embodied by Noah. At the other end of the spectrum, Tubal-Cain represents humans seeking godhood, acquiring the physical and mental tools to reach the same status as the Creator. This is the Gnostic philosophy adopted by the occult elite. While embodied by the “bad guy”, it is nevertheless presented as an alternative to the absurdity of the Creator who created humanity to then destroy it.

In short, Noah is far from an “idiotic” movie (as some reviewers have stated). It manages to sell a New Age religion based on self-hatred while giving a nod to the occult elite, those who fancy themselves to be descendants of Tubal-Cain. But the occult elite does not believe in radical environmentalism OR care about human life. They are the ones behind all our major wars and their greed is the main cause of nature’s destruction. Through movie’s like Noah, they are trying to put the burden of their own wrongdoings on the unsuspecting masses who usually do as they are told. They want us to welcome the idea of a “great cleansing”.

In the Bible, after the Great Flood, God himself states :

So, whether you believe in the Bible or not, know that if there is another major “cleansing” on Earth, it will not come from “the Creator”. It will come from those who have brainwashed you for years, convincing you to believe you are a cancer on Earth.",conspiracy,C01b84,big.foot
331,"Inspired by Caroliens experience with the mini-108; I decided to make one myself.I marked it out on a piece of plywood in a very simple way; Just made an 18 of the appropriate size on a sheet of paper like this:Then cut a square meter of plywood; set the paper template on it and poked through each of the 18 points in turn using a bradawl before moving the paper on to its next position until all seven 18s were marked with little holes on the plywood:I then stuck a tiny TB to each point using contact adhesive and it was done.As I was positioning the final few mini-TBs; a fresh blustery wind started blowing and Sylphs began to appear in numbers.At dusk; three small lenticular clouds appeared in the sky right above the 108 but it was already too dark to take a photograph.Today the Sylphs arrived again in numbers and we even had a visit from a black helicopter around midday.As night falls once more; the sky is filled with unseasonal rainclouds..The individual TBs are no bigger than a bottle-top and yet the sum total appears to be profoundly positive.Dan.

Good job, Carolien--I'm blown away by the quality of the work! My patterns are kind of crude by comparison.Our business was under radionics assault a month ago, characterized by sharply, suddenly dwindled orders. On the day when I set up a 108 the orders started coming in as before and stayed steady until a week ago, when I delivered that 108 to Dooney and Steve. Then the orders dwindled again, for Carol and I. I'm waiting for some feedback from Dooney and Stevo, since they are also under constant radionics assault. The other business person, besides Carolien, who is particularly targetted that way is Andy Schwarm of ctbusters.com . I'm not happy that we're being perpetually smacked by the CIA and NSA this way but I'm glad nobody else among our associates evidently is.I'm making another pattern, now, and will make some trick, conical orgonite bits for each of the 108 points. I'll use TBs sort of like Andy's, this time, and will add nice crystals and spiral coils inside. Cones and pyramids have almost equal energy dynamics, evidently, and I bet the cone shape will really blast out. I don't mind the lull in business, much, because I hadn't been able to get ahead with production, so my personal life was suffering. I'm definitely NOT a workaholic.It's still early to make any claims for this device, which was invented by Cesco, based perhaps on Kelly's earlier field experiments.Promoting it is a little bit dicey because Cesco hasn't mentioned whether he favors others profitting from this intellectual property. Also, when he was last here, a year and a half ago, he was uncertain whether an identical orgonite piece should go in the center of each of the seven hexagram 'cells,' which would make the number, 115 rather than 108.Just because Carol and I long ago gave away the plans for orgonite cloudbbusters, the Succor Punch, Powerwand, the Big Secret, Holy Handgrenades and Towerbusters doesn't mean that it's appropriate for other inventors to give away their creations, of course. I'm sure not giving away the formulas for the 'secret ingredients' of our own commercial offerings, after allbecause we want to keep a competitive edge and there is always more than one way to accomplish anything.That said, I'd be very pleased if it's appropriate for Carolien to market these beautiful templates and perhaps the orgonite that goes on them. Since the orgonite is interactive I think it would be productive to boost it with gems, coils, etc., in an intelligent way.The only way to get a good idea of the device's parameters is to get a whole lot of them in the hands of people who are in a position to give substantive feedback. That's how we test our own mods before we decide to market them.~Don

In last weeks chat, Don mentioned that he had made a small 108 (a little over a square meter) to stop radionics on his biz and was making some more to help out Stevo, Dooney and others. Radionics are often used to put a dome over our businesses, to make them invisible for customers. Frequently we boost each others biz to clear these etheric fogs.I couldn't wait to make my own 108 and started the next day making a template on paper, using the picture Cesco once posted on EW (enlarged 6 times for the square meter endresult):See picture on whale.to page: http://www.whale.to/b/108_h.html However, taping the twentyfour pages together into one print, turned out rather messy. Despite my tongue in cheek effort, the circle became all crooked. Using my compasses to draw the 108 on another sheet, left me with a buzzing headache of all the measurements. I sure lost my touch with maths!So in the end, I gave myself a break and ordered a weatherproof outdoor poster of the 108 template on pvc sheet. This Dutch company makes a 110x110cm sheet for about 108 euroA perfect size for using half size tb's with 5cm diameter. It is quite easy (and cheaper) to have one made by a company in your own country - just look for vinyl outdoor poster/banner sellers on the Internet, there are lots! Many outdoor poster sellers have a download option for your own picture on a banner. All you have to do is:1) download the 108 picture on http://www.whale.to/b/108_h.html 2) enlarge it 6 times on your own computer (to match the approximate square meter)3) and order a banner at the size to fit the enlarged templateHere is my finished 108 - well, almost finished, I had to make one more small tb...It is too soon to tell wether it is really working against the radionics on my biz. It hasn't been up for a day yet. But for what it's worth: my computer screen stopped flickering for the first time in a year (I had grown accustomed to that flickering! Thought it was due to old age. Hopefully it doesn't start tomorrow again, hehe). Physically, I felt my feet charka burning healthy unlike I have experienced in over a year too. So far, so good. I will report more in time.It would be my pleasure to order a template for EW members. Since we all are radionics targets, our observations might be worthwhile. Please PM me for that.Carolien

After all, ancient traditions have put great emphasis on the study of sacred geometry. But we don't just want to jump onto the new age bandwagon and get prematurely very excited. We leave that to the wannabe Gurus, ok? 

 The final kick to overcome my natural inertia and get busy with this experiment came from the feedback that some of the first experimentors gave: 

 The energy of this setup is appartently very strong and could give extended protection against all kinds of etheric interference. 

 

 Since we are constantly aware of such interference being directed at us, it was a no brainer to get us started.

 And after sticking them on and putting the board upright, just standing in front of it, I must say: Wow! 

 

 

 Wow, I have never felt anything like it! 

 

 In a way it felt like being hit by direct sunlight, but much more pleasant and energising. (and sunlight is already pleasant, I think) But this light does not stay on the surface of your skin, it goes right through, embracing all molecules of your body. The whole space feels lit up and energized. 

 Also there is a sensation of a very high frequency sound, but it's not in the ear. 

 We have hung it on the wall of our kitchen which serves as our dinng room as well. Whenever I walk past it, I feel compelled to stand in front of it and spead the arms in order to soak up that energy. 

 

 The night after it was finished, I went into the EW chat and asked the psychics if they could pick up some interference on our business, because I had a week with very low orders and it felt like one of the usual radionics blockades we so frequently have to put up with. The feedback I got from Axel that evening was, that the energy of the new 108 is so strong, it has already blasted away all interference. 

 

 Finished and klaar then as we say in South Africa? 

 

 A day later I went to visit our highly psychic friend Valda and on just telling her about it, she could tune into the energy and confirmed that it's extremely powerful. 

 I'm still ""under the influence"", but I suggest you follow the discussion on EW and in the etheric science forum.

After all, ancient traditions have put great emphasis on the study of sacred geometry. But we don't just want to jump onto the new age bandwagon and get prematurely very excited. We leave that to the wannabe Gurus, ok?The final kick to overcome my natural inertia and get busy with this experiment came from the feedback that some of the first experimentors gave:The energy of this setup is appartently very strong and could give extended protection against all kinds of etheric interference.Since we are constantly aware of such interference being directed at us, it was a no brainer to get us started.Georg sticking them onAnd after sticking them on and putting the board upright, just standing in front of it, I must say: Wow!Wow, I have never felt anything like it!In a way it felt like being hit by direct sunlight, but much more pleasant and energising. (and sunlight is already pleasant, I think) But this light does not stay on the surface of your skin, it goes right through, embracing all molecules of your body. The whole space feels lit up and energized.Also there is a sensation of a very high frequency sound, but it's not in the ear.We have hung it on the wall of our kitchen which serves as our dinng room as well. Whenever I walk past it, I feel compelled to stand in front of it and spead the arms in order to soak up that energy.The night after it was finished, I went into the EW chat and asked the psychics if they could pick up some interference on our business, because I had a week with very low orders and it felt like one of the usual radionics blockades we so frequently have to put up with. The feedback I got from Axel that evening was, that the energy of the new 108 is so strong, it has already blasted away all interference.Finished and klaar then as we say in South Africa?A day later I went to visit our highly psychic friend Valda and on just telling her about it, she could tune into the energy and confirmed that it's extremely powerful.I'm still ""under the influence"", but I suggest you follow the discussion on EW and in the etheric science forum.____________

My previous post in this thread reads like an unbridled endorsement of the 108. 

 I would like to report that my opinion has been modified somewhat in the light of more recent experience with the device. 

 

 Following my initial glowing impressions of its effects (mostly on the sky); I began to notice a number of more negative changes in the area. 

 

 The sky became hazy and cloudless and the wind dropped; rather in the way it does during a concerted chemtrail attack (but there were no chemtrails) and the Sylphs completely disappeared. 

 

 We each began to exhibit classic symptoms of the effects of DOR (headaches, poor sleep patterns, listlessness and lack of inspiration) all highly unusual given the quantity of orgonite in the area. 

 

 It was almost as though the three CBs in my garden had all stopped working in unison. 

 

 After a few days; my suspicions fell on the wonderful 108 that everyone (myself included) was raving about. 

 

 Id assembled it with meticulous precision from small pieces of simple orgonite so there could be nothing wrong with the stone-combinations or coils as there were none (also the drawing was both correct and accurately drafted). 

 

 The easy way to find out was to simply take it away from its then horizontal position (where the energy vortex was presumably effecting the sky) and stand it upright against the workshop wall. 

 

 Almost immediately the gentle breeze returned and the sky slowly cleared and it seemed that the CBs were beginning to work normally again. 

 

 The subjective negative effects on each of us continued though and Id find myself staring into space when there were things to be done; apparently lost for an idea. 

 

 Finally I dismantled the 108 and put the component pieces away. 

 All the negative effects evaporated and the area returned to normal (and has remained this way ever since). 

 

 As I say; I do not know where to attribute the source of this negativity; given the wholesale endorsement of the 108 by a range of experienced orgonite experimenters, some of whom have posted in this thread. 

 

 The only other 108 I ever made was constructed from lawn-busters (orgonite spikes that are trodden into soft ground). 

 Each spike of orgonite contained a Cesco coil and a quartz chip and I set them in the soil (EP-style) with a hammer. 

 

 On that occasion; I remember a fresh blustery breeze starting as I had nearly completed the arrangement and initial good effects on the atmosphere. 

 

 For some reason I became disaffected with that initial 108 and eventually dug it out of the ground and threw the pieces in the Bali Strait on a trip to Java. 

 

 I didnt suspect the integrity of the 108 matrix at that time and just assumed that there must have been a conflict between so many coils set in close proximity to each other. 

 

 I do not pretend to understand these negative effects of the 108 and I realize that this is not the first time that my findings have been completely at odds with the general consensus on this forum. 

 

 I hope that others do not experience anything similar and that the 108 continues to get rave reviews. 

 

 I would however be dishonest if I allowed my earlier impressions of the device to stand uncorrected. 

 

 Dan. 

 

 

 

 





 

 Kelly has reminded me that this is not his invention, by the way. I think I was giving the impression that it is. This is Cesco's tentative presentation and Kelly has gone on to experiment with a 114 arrangement. 

 

 So far, we've had nothing but good experiences with ours, as have Dooney and STevo and one or two others. 

 

 We looked closely at your problem in Dooney's chatroom, yesterday, and focused mainly on the unhappy entity that Kelly found on/under your property. Stevo evidently got into a dialog with this one and all the psychics had the impression that the entity is an elemental who is extremely displeased with the world order's manipulation and sabotage of Bali's energy field, also not able or willing to distinguish that from your own engineering. 

 

 Francie, early on, clearly saw a witch doctor looking closely at you these days and that one is probably associated with the elemental & anxious about the technology you're using. 

 

 Bali is the only island in that enormous archipelago, as far as I know, whose inhabitants have mostly held to the older ways and didn't embrace Islam when Arab merchants and scholars went there so many centuries ago. I think it was only the Turks and perhaps Moghuls who forced conversion to Islam, which was very much against Muhammad's teachings. 

 

 The style of Hinduism in Bali seems to me like the more ancient animism that we see in Tibetan Buddhism and Shintoism, which may be to say that the 'older ways' involve close cooperation with elementals. A nice confirmation of that may be the way that the Shinto priests whom Tetsuzi-san met were eager to accept his orgonite gifts for their shrine/vortex; they immediately understood the energy and its uses. 

 

 Stevo evidently worked out a deal with your elemental room mate to let you reassemble the 108 and keep it going for three months, if you're willing. He promised not to interfere during that time while he evaluates it. 

 

 We had an awful lot of fun in that chat session, by the way. Francie's past exposure to Jesuits at college in Georgetown produced some Jesuit predators in a murder ritual, which we also dealt with in the session. I had a notion to 'offer' these child-murderers to that elemental on your property as a gift and Stevo said he accepted. We expressed our love to the elemental who the psychics said was very surprised to find Westerners who honored him/her/it. 

 

 We operate on the assumption that elementals are neither good nor bad but are certainly essential to all the workings of our planet. This is unspeakably weird to mainstream folks but when one is willing to loose the shackles of conventionality it's a whole lot of fun and also empowering to interact with elementals, most of whom love orgonite, after all. 

 

 Your situation reminded me of the big elementals Carol and I encountered on Andros Island in the Bahamas, where we went to gift the blue holes. The Bahamians on that island have gotten pretty far from their African roots and are quite churchified, so they seem to hate and fear the elementals there. Carol immediately got the impression that they hated people on account of it but as soon as we started tossing orgonite out into the very dense bush for them, then into the blue holes over the next few days. I heard them as galloping horses, which didn't surprise me even though you can't penetrate more than a few inches into that jungle without a bulldozer and they were obviously very happy that some people finally acknowledged them. I think the orgonite also toned down the churchy people's paranoia about these nature guardians, too. 

 

 Your case is absolutely unique, Dan, but I encourage you to avoid making assumptions about the devices and will rather consider the more hidden dynamics. We want to help you resolve this. I think that if the problem were rather with the technology then we'd have heard reports like this from other stable and reputable people but you're the only one so there's obviously something else going on. 

 

 Kelly did a great job identifying the source of your previous trouble and it might be useful for you to get acquainted with some traditional magicians on Bali if the opportunity arises. If the old ways on Bali were not valid I doubt the people could have kept those traditions into modern times and I like to honor people who do that. There are a few other cultures around the world who have achieved this. The Black Caribs (Garifuna) of Central America are one and I found them quite endearing. There are lots of them in Africa and rural Asia where Big Religion clergy haven't bludgeoned people into superstition and paranoia about natural forces. 

 

 A witch doctor in the mountains of North Thailand sent an emissary to get instructions for making orgonite from Eddie-san when he was vacationing there a few years ago. They didnt' know each other and as far as I know Eddie hasn't gotten any followup. 

 

 I had the opportunity to receive a lot of similar stories/teachings from Dorothy the Witch, who was one of a 3,000 year family line of witches from Wales and perhaps a longer line of medicine people from the Seneca tribe. She has travelled to over 40 countries in a synchronous way and was sought out by members of ancient, benevolent secret orders in most of those. We could learn a lot about synchronicity from folks like these if we're fortunate enough to know them. 

 

 A group of kindly witches gave protection to Carol and her associates when they arrived in rural Kenya 8 years ago and I believe if it weren't for that, the malevolent 'night runners' would have harmed one or more of them, then. 

 

 This is the hidden world which orgonite suits us to behold and appreciate if we'll open ourselves to it. Some of us need to abandon certain prejudices in order to venture there, of course.

 Research implies a sort of commitment. Carol and I have been experimenting with orgonite for over ten years and we've personally never seen evidence that orgonite can produce harmful effects in any configuration. The only orgonite that makes balanced people even mildly uncomfortable are the intentionally disharmonious products made and sold by a few disreputable orgonite vendors and they achieve that by skillfully combining elements that are not harmonious with each other. One is very unlikely to 'achieve' those effects accidently or stupidly. I suppose there will always be people who lack discernment on a level that makes them susceptible to the hypnotic effects of charismatic scoundrels like those but 'caveat emptor.' 

 

 Maybe an aspect of commitment is to decide to trust that our orgonite devices are not going to do any harm, so when we get psyched out and are tempted to destroy or dismantle an orgonite device we can perhaps consider that those thoughts are implanted rather than our own. The corporate psychiatrists in Freud's frightful Tavistock tradition work pretty hard to stampede people who are in a position to make the world better, after all. 

 

 Powering through doubt and uncertainty with some commitment can often produce real gems of new insights, too. It's always better if we discover these on our own, through our own observations and efforts, than to get them second hand. 

 

 One of the psychics noted that the corporate freaks seem desperate to find a way to overcome the positive effects of the 108, so we ought to expect a little strangeness in our vicinity. As far as we can tell, the harder they try the harder they're falling and it seems to us that this network is turning yet another corner with this new approach: sacred geometry configurations of simple orgonite. I never could have predicted this because, before, the only folks shouting about sacred geometry were high-profile, charismatic scoundrels 

 

 I guess the obvious 'next step' when seeing manifestations of the corporate predators' displeasure in our vicinity is to see whether it dissipates on its own and how quickly. My hunch is that the more they can throw at any orgonite device, the quicker it will dissipate. 

 

 Dan, I also haven't heard anyone else report bad effects from chemtrail spraying in many years, except from the chemtrails that are sprayed below the clouds and that's quite rare by now. When the atmosphere has a lot of water in it, the chemtrails seed longer-lasting clouds and this certainly creates a psychological effect in some folks. When I see a long-lasting chemtrail-seeded cloud I actually applaud the corporate predators' tecchies because it's hard for them to achieve that here, as it probably also is where you live. I think they're constantly experimenting with new , ematerials and they bring it to bear most aggressively in places like Bali, where they've lost the most ground to orgonite. 

 

 I saw one such long-lived cloud across our sky, last week, that partly dropped below the spew altitude but when I saw it a few minutes later, the cloud had flattened and was already dissipating. I like to remind folks who email me about their fear of chemtrails that there's usually one plane spewing the evil stuff in with the other planes that are just seeding transient clouds and the evil (bioweapon?) chemtrails are the ones that disappear almost instantaneously, I believe. Just about everyone, by now, lives in range of at least one cloudbuster so the evil spew is disappearing fast everywhere, now. The Chicken Little disinfo sites are the source of most of the residual chemtrail terror, of course, and the vast majority of people who see chemtrails, now, didn't notice them when they were still sickening and killing people, many years ago. They looked and behaved quite differently, then. I should probably post about that, again. Sometimes repitition is necessary. 

 

 Also, when there's a lot of water in the atmosphere, making seeded clouds possible, the atmospheric pressure is sometimes low and that's also associated with relative depression and ennui. I hope this helps! 

 

 Manfred and associates are demonstrating on ethericresearch.com how patient and observant we each need to be to explore any of these phenomena in a thorough and intelligent way. This is in sharp contrast to the way so many of us were blindly jumping to imitate and promote untested claims and tools when a charismatic personality was the source. I think we've come a long way and it makes me very proud of everyone here.

 CArolien mentioned, in the chat, that dark clouds gathered in the sky near her, recently, and she also wondered if this was an effect of the 108. After all, Holland probably has the densest concentration of orgonite cloudbusters of any country, also perhaps the highest percentage of gifted death towers and weather weapons.Research implies a sort of commitment.

 I didnt want to post about it prematurely, because going public with observations often has its own dynamics, while temporarily disassembling the 108 was intended to pace myself in the process of understanding its possible interactions. 

 

 Also, including the 108 in the reduction of possible outside influences  to check if all this was interference or perhaps some personal process  was a reluctant thing for me to do, for I was so curious about its possible effects in dissolving negative thoughtforms, as reported by Carol. 

 

 Then Francie emailed an observation that swept me in doubt about the corruption resistance of a 108 and made me decide to temporarily remove it. I better post part of her email here as a quote, to not loose words in translation. 

 

 I can already see some occult geometry being put over your location.... I looked and saw this geometry again last night. As I approached the geometry it flashed and I saw bloody bulls' horns and spring/early summer fields. I think that was the energy of this spell being made. I know biodynamic farmers still use the energy of the horns in their fields. What I saw over you would be a corruption of this very old abundance/growth/fulfillment power ritual. 

 

 In previous observations, Francie and Bob had seen my sleep deprivations derive from astral projections during sleep. Part of me had been flying in the 108 vortex and somehow been captured, by the spell and my own lack of grounding (thus the fear of going to sleep). Things felt a 100% better and back to normal after Francie had removed this geometric overlay. But that left me in doubt whether this could happen again, as you perhaps can understand. 

 

 Anyhow, all this kick-started a serious commitment to exploring my own habits of thought and disciplining myself into more positive think. As I said in the bugs post, it reminded me of experiencing George Orwells room 101 (1984), where people are tortured with their own fears until they give up their concept of reality. 

 

 After disassembling the 108, the only outside influence left was my detox program. I need to add this and risk more controversy  for this detox had a profound effect on my tendency to think in negative circles. It convinced me that parasites have a role in maintaining negative thoughtforms, for which we blame our character. 

 

 My 108 is up again. I feel strong enough to take more occult spells to test if they really can corrupt a 108s energy or see if I can manage myself now. As for the interaction, both Francie and Dooney saw my 108 more grounded now. Maybe its all part of a personal process, who knows? This etheric world leaves me flabbergasted all the time. But thoughtforms seem to be very real! Now I am curious how much happiness I can take 

 

 

 

 

 Dan, I have to back you up to some extend  that is, Ive also disassembled my 108 for a few weeks. Mainly because, at some point, there was too much going on (as posted here and here ) for me to discern what caused what. Especially the thought-manifestation occurrences confused me. Believe me, the amount of bugs manifesting was not funny and I felt like a wicked witch for the way my negative thoughts became instant reality to people around me. So, besides disassembling the 108 I also disconnected every SP and other possible thought-enhancing equipment in the house  to gradually build things up again, one by one, and see what would happen.I didnt want to post about it prematurely, because going public with observations often has its own dynamics, while temporarily disassembling the 108 was intended to pace myself in the process of understanding its possible interactions.Also, including the 108 in the reduction of possible outside influences  to check if all this was interference or perhaps some personal process  was a reluctant thing for me to do, for I was so curious about its possible effects in dissolving negative thoughtforms, as reported by Carol.Then Francie emailed an observation that swept me in doubt about the corruption resistance of a 108 and made me decide to temporarily remove it.

 In august my girlfriend and I spent our holidays in Sweden. We did some gifting there but we also spent some days with fishing, campfire ect.. One evening we came back from the lake with our canoe because there were dark clouds on the sky. We left the canoe down by the lake and went a small way up to our cottage. Only a few steps before we reached the cottage there was a small wooden electricity pylon(maybe 7m high). When we were walking directly near that pylon I looked up and in that moment I saw a lightning flash on the top of the pylon immediately followed by an enormous clap of thunder. Everything was turned into blue light. Anna saw everything in pink light. We had big luck to be still alive, I think ... and it had been the only lightning in the environment of our house on that evening. When the lighting stroke we had a big Orgonite ( 5 kg) in our canoe (that we used as an anchor) about 100 m down by the lake and a HHG in the cottage . We both wore the harmonic protector. (we wear the HP's day and night since the day we had got them). When I read your article , Manfred, I remembered that occurence and I thought that possibly the lightning had been an attack... ....

 My posting does not referr to the 108 but when when i read your posting, Manfred, I immediatly remembered a situation that happenend a few weeks ago so I want to share it .In august my girlfriend and I spent our holidays in Sweden.

We left the canoe down by the lake and went a small way up to our cottage. Only a few steps before we reached the cottage there was a small wooden electricity pylon(maybe 7m high). When we were walking directly near that pylon I looked up and in that moment I saw a lightning flash on the top of the pylon immediately followed by an enormous clap of thunder. Everything was turned into blue light. Anna saw everything in pink light. We had big luck to be still alive, I think ... and it had been the only lightning in the environment of our house on that evening. When the lighting stroke we had a big Orgonite ( 5 kg) in our canoe (that we used as an anchor) about 100 m down by the lake and a HHG in the cottage . We both wore the harmonic protector. (we wear the HP's day and night since the day we had got them). When I read your article , Manfred, I remembered that occurence and I thought that possibly the lightning had been an attack.......Moritz",conspiracy,C023fe,big.foot
1041,"Three unmistakable signs that WAR is coming to America: Pompeo orders all American citizens to “immediately” return to the USA

By now, you know that I was more than a month ahead of virtually all media — independent and mainstream — in warning about the coming coronavirus pandemic. When I first released projections of 10,000 deaths in America by May 10th, nearly everyone thought the idea was insane (probably including you). As it turns out, we are likely to have over 100,000 deaths by May 10th, according to what the White House is now saying.

This is worth mentioning because today we have a new warning about where things are headed. There have been three unmistakable signs that war is coming to the United States very soon. Those signs have all emerged in the past week, all with a sense of urgency that goes far beyond any concern about a pandemic:

Sign #1) President Trump activating one million military reservists with medical skills to treat battlefield injuries. Details of this order are found in the EO text at WhiteHouse.gov.

Sign #2) The Pentagon ordering high-level staffers into deep underground bunkers in Colorado. This was announced by NORAD and NORTHCOM in a Facebook town hall meeting. Obviously, you don’t order military staffers into a 2,000-foot deep bunker just because of a virus.

Sign #3) Secretary of State Pompeo just ordered all Americans living overseas to return to the US “immediately.” The cover story for this is that the coronavirus is collapsing international flights. But that alone would not justify all Americans returning from living overseas, since many Americans would just hunker down where they’re living. But Pompeo wants all Americans to return immediately, which is the kind of thing you do before a war breaks out (with China, most likely). Via The UK Independent:

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged Americans abroad who still wish to return to the United States to do so “immediately,” saying commercial and government-chartered flights could soon cease amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Donald Trump’s top diplomat urged any Americans abroad who want to get back to US soil to contact the American embassy in the country where they currently are to begin making plans “immediately” to get a flight back to the States.

That’s because Pompeo doesn’t want to end up negotiating for the release of American prisoners being held by the communist Chinese regime, obviously. Any American reading this who is still in China or Hong Kong should strongly consider bugging out. By the way, we were also told weeks ago from another source that China has already begun executing anti-communist leaders in Hong Kong, which now seems to be preparation for the global war that’s about to happen next.

These three events are unmistakable signs that high-level officials within the Pentagon and US State Department anticipate actions of war in the very near future. China is the most likely adversary, especially given that China probably released the Wuhan coronavirus in the first place, knowing that America would have a much more difficult time locking down cities compared to China itself, which we now believe may have lost millions of citizens despite its best efforts to contain the virus.

Notably, the Wuhan coronavirus, released by China, has managed to cripple the US Navy by infecting sailors on aircraft carriers and other vessels. This is not an accident. It’s part of the “softening up” phase to weaken America in advance of the attack.

Expect an attack on America when the nation reaches “peak pandemic” health chaos and economic disruptions

The ideal time for a foreign enemy to attack the United States would be when our nation is in the throes of economic collapse and a pandemic medical emergency. According to estimates announced by the White House today, coronavirus-related deaths will peak in the USA on April 12th, but lockdowns will continue through the end of April, causing financial reverberations to echo across the nation for many months yet to come.

The White House currently expects up to 240,000 Americans to die from the coronavirus over the next several months. (Our own estimates top out at just 90,000 fatalities, by the way.)

Due to the coronavirus crunch, joblessness, homelessness and rising social unrest will sow chaos across the landscape of America for the remainder of the year (and well into 2021), and that doesn’t even count whatever political chaos might be added to the mix surrounding the coming November elections. Plus, there are food shortages that are starting to become very real, while a massive wave of price inflation for consumer goods will appear soon thanks to the trillions of dollars in bailout money that Trump and the Fed just threw at the economy.

With one-third of the US Congress now run by communist China — and most of the left-wing media making excuses for China and trying to shift the coronavirus blame to Trump — it’s clear that China’s longstanding desire to infiltrate and destroy the United States of America has reached a tipping point. They will likely pull the trigger soon, which could mean economic warfare (selling all US debt and announcing a new gold-backed world reserve currency), kinetic warfare (an actual land invasion of Chinese troops hitting the beaches in California), nuclear warfare (or an EMP weapon detonated above North America), or even new waves of biological warfare (SARS-cov-3, SARS-cov-4, etc.). And don’t forget cyber warfare, a favorite of the tech-savvy communist regime.

We don’t know exactly what’s coming, but we know the leadership in America believes something big is about to happen. Otherwise, none of the actions listed above would have been taken.

Ramp up your preparedness to a whole new level, if you can

Prepare for all the following, just in case one or more happen:
• A blackout of all internet and phone communications
• Foreign troops invading the US, including through the Mexico border
• Attempted assassination of President Trump, or a possible “civil war” inside the Pentagon
• The possibility of mass arrests of deep state traitors who are Chinese collaborators, such as Sen. Feinstein, Gov. Newsom, etc.

We cannot be certain that any of these will happen, and we hope none of them do. But there are giant red flashing warning signs just screaming out that something big is about to go down. The only two scenarios that make sense are a WAR with a foreign enemy or possibly the initiation of a domestic civil war (or perhaps both).

If you thought encountering a purchase limit on toilet paper was the worst problem you might encounter this year, think again. JR Nyquist explains why China is just itching to destroy the United States and has long been planning to use a biological weapon to soften up America in advance of the military attack wave:

1211,"Sprite Argentina (owned by The Coca-Cola Company) recently released on its social media platforms an ad titled Orgullo (translated to Pride) which depicts several scenarios involving parents and their gender dysphoric children dressing up as the opposite sex. Set to the emotional song You’ll Never Walk Alone, the ad depicts the premature sexualization of children as a wholesome family activity.

Here are some of the key scenes:

The fact that we see this woman tightly strapping on this undergarment as emotional music plays in the background is odd. One of the many reasons this is odd: Binding breasts leads to important health risks.

Binding for extended periods of time can lead to rashes or yeast infections under the breasts, back or chest pain, shortness of breath, overheating, or fractured ribs. Unsafe binding may lead to permanent deformation of the breasts, scarring, and lung constriction and long-term binding may adversely affect the outcome of a future mastectomy. In one study, 97.2% of those surveyed had some sort of health problem caused by binding.

 – Wikipedia, “Binding”

In another scene, there is more body-tightening going on.

In the 20th century, corsets were deemed dangerous and “instruments of female torture”.

This ad is not merely about “pride” or “diversity”, it is about pushing an agenda. It is about involving minors in it and shaming parents who do not actively get involved in it.

An Agenda is Being Pushed

The gender-blurring agenda has been identified on this site several years ago and it keeps getting stronger. We know that there’s an “agenda” (which means “an underlying often ideological plan or program”) going on because:
• It is over-represented in mass media
• It is pushed by powerful actors
• It targets minors (and their parents) intentionally.

Here are some recent examples:

If you believe that global corporations such as Coca-Cola create social ads because “they care”, you are dead wrong. They don’t. They are pushing an agenda that was precisely calculated and thought-out by powerful think tanks to shape and mold a new generation. What they are actually looking for is confusion, anxiety, insecurity and a general feeling of disconnection towards everything that is real. And they are succeeding.

US Suicide Pilot Joe Stack Named First “Gray Champion” Of 21st Century

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

In a move sure to bring both shock and fear to the ruling classes of , especially their government officials, the American Patriot Community has named suicide pilot Joe Stack as their “first Gray Champion of the 21st Century”.

According to the American Patriot website GrayChampion.Com, by Joe Stack’s piloting his plane into the Echelon Federal Building this past week he “has fired the first shot in the New American Revolution.”

“Gray Champion’s are also those rarest of Americans, arising to stand among their fellow citizens to “do their duty” on an average of once or twice every generation….a time that has come, once again, as the future of the United States hangs in the balance.

The true determination of who can be called a Gray Champion rests with history as these rarest of Americans were during their times, and by the actions they performed, were always labeled as terrorists, rebels, murderers and traitors and held up for scorn by the elite classes, government officials and media barons who were the targets of these Gray Champions in the first place.”

In our previous report about the actions of Joe Stack (and actually when we had first heard of the American moniker “Gray Champion”) to strike back against a government he believed no longer served the true interests of its citizens, we quoted from his “manifesto” delivered to the World upon his death, and wherein he said:

“I can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be white washed and ignored that the American zombies wake up and revolt; it will take nothing less. I would only hope that by striking a nerve that stimulates the inevitable double standard, knee-jerk government reaction that results in more stupid draconian restrictions people wake up and begin to see the pompous political thugs and their mindless minions for what they are.

Sadly, though I spent my entire life trying to believe it wasn’t so, but violence not only is the answer, it is the only answer. The cruel joke is that the really big chunks of shit at the top have known this all along and have been laughing, at and using this awareness against, fools like me all along.”

To the fears of Joe Stack and his fellow American citizens of their living in a country whose government no longer serves them, but in chilling fact sees them all as enemies and has begun targeting them for destruction, the evidence is becoming overwhelming, and as we can read:

As reported by the ABC Television News Service in their February 3rd article titled “License to Kill? Intelligence Chief Says U.S. Can Take Out American Terrorists” they report:

“The director of national intelligence affirmed rather bluntly today that the U.S. intelligence community has authority to target American citizens for assassination if they present a direct terrorist threat to the United States.

“We take direct actions against terrorists in the intelligence community; if … we think that direct action will involve killing an American, we get specific permission to do that,” Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair told the House Intelligence Committee.”

Based upon US Intelligence Director Blair’s testimony to Congress, and should the American government had discovered Joe Stack’s plan to attack the Echelon Federal Building in Texas, they had the right to assassinate him instead of arresting him and bringing him to trial, and which flies in the face of every standard the United States was built upon, not to mention its being against their own laws and Constitution.

And it gets worse…

In a just released report (February 19th) titled “Bush Lawyer Said President Could Order Civilians to Be 'Massacred'” by the American news magazine Newsweek it is said:

“The chief author of the Bush administration's ""torture memo” told Justice Department investigators that the president's war-making authority was so broad that he had the constitutional power to order a village to be ""massacred”, according to a report by released Friday night by the Office of Professional Responsibility.”

To those Americans believing that their government would never result to the wholesale massacring of them they are warned to think twice, especially when viewed in the light of a just released article by the US Newswire Service titled “1,000 Architects & Engineers Call for New 9/11 Investigation” and which, in part, says:

“Richard Gage, AIA, architect and founder of the non-profit Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth, Inc. (AE911Truth), will announce a decisive milestone today at a press conference in San Francisco, as more than 1,000 worldwide architects and engineers now support the call for a new investigation into the destruction of the Twin Towers and Building 7 at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. After careful examination of the official explanation, along with the forensic data omitted from official reports, these professionals have concluded that a new independent investigation into these mysterious collapses is needed.

Gage and his group base their conclusions on forensic evidence. Gage states, ""The official FEMA and NIST reports provide insufficient, contradictory, and fraudulent accounts of the circumstances of the towers' destruction. We are therefore calling for a grand jury investigation of NIST officials. Gage points out the destruction of the third high-rise, World Trade Center 7, a 47-story skyscraper which was not hit by an aircraft, yet came down in pure free-fall acceleration for more than 100 feet, a significant fact that NIST has been forced to admit, due to research conducted by AE911Truth petition signers. Other disturbing facts emerging from the forensic evidence include:

Complete destruction of both Twin Towers in just 10 to 14 seconds at near free-fall acceleration

Over 100 first-responder reports of explosions and flashes at onset of destruction

1200-foot-dia. debris field: no ""pancaked"" floors seen in the debris pile

Several tons of molten metal found in debris.

Evidence of advanced explosive nano-thermitic composite material found in the WTC dust by an international team of scientists”

Even worse for these Americans are those still believing that President Obama is going to protect them, but which all the evidence clearly shows he is not going to do, in fact, since taking office he has not only continued all of the former President Bush’s policies, he is now actively involved in protecting from prosecution the Bush Administration “architects” of the new Fascist state being created in the United States along with continuing the cover-up of the events surrounding 9/11, and as we can read:

As reported by the Associated Press News Service in their article titled “DOJ review finds no misconduct by memo authors”, Obama overruled his own Department of Justice lawyers who wanted the Bush Administration authors of the so called “torture memos” prosecuted and has allowed them to go unpunished, and as we can read:

“An initial review by the Justice Department's internal affairs unit found that former[Bush] government lawyers Jay Bybee and John Yoo had committed professional misconduct, a conclusion that could have cost them their law licenses. But, underscoring just how controversial and legally thorny the memos have become, the Justice Department's top career lawyer [and close Obama friend] reviewed the matter and disagreed.”

Scarier still about Obama are new reports coming from the US questioning weather he is even in control, and as we can read as reported by the Salon.Com News Service in their report titled “Who's in control in the White House?”, and which, in part, says:

“Recall that one year ago, Obama instructed the DEA to follow his campaign pledge and respect local statutes legalizing medicinal marijuana. When the DEA kept raiding pot dispensaries in states that had passed such laws, Attorney General Eric Holder reiterated the cease and desist decree, stating that ""What (Obama) said during the campaign is now American policy.""

As even more raids nonetheless continued, the Justice Department then issued an explicit memo ordering federal agents to refrain from prosecuting those who are in ""compliance with existing state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana.""

And yet the DEA has recently intensified its crackdown. Here in Colorado -- where voters enshrined medical marijuana's legality in our state constitution -- the feds not only raided two dispensaries, but did so in a way that deliberately humiliated their superiors.

In January, the DEA stormed a company that performs cannabis quality tests. The firm’s alleged infraction? Following protocol and formally applying for a federal equipment license. DEA rogues responded to the request not with thanks or -- heaven forbid -- approval, but instead with the gestapo.

This was topped last week when DEA agents arrested a medical marijuana grower who dared discuss his business with a local news outlet. Sensing a P.R. opportunity, DEA agent Jeffrey Sweetin used the spectacle to insist that he will not listen to stand-down directives from his bosses.”

Now most interesting about all of these events now occurring in the United States, including Joe Stack now being said to be one of the “Gray Champions” of his generation, is that they have been predicted to occur, and as we can read as reported by the Wall Street Journal News Service in their December 29, 2008 article titled “As if Things Weren't Bad Enough, Russian Professor Predicts End of U.S.”, and which says:

“For a decade, Russian academic Igor Panarin has been predicting the U.S. will fall apart in 2010. For most of that time, he admits, few took his argument -- that an economic and moral collapse will trigger a civil war and the eventual breakup of the U.S. -- very seriously. Now he's found an eager audience: Russian state media.

In recent weeks, he's been interviewed as much as twice a day about his predictions. ""It's a record,"" says Prof. Panarin. ""But I think the attention is going to grow even stronger.""

Prof. Panarin, 50 years old, is not a fringe figure. A former KGB analyst, he is dean of the Russian Foreign Ministry's academy for future diplomats. He is invited to Kremlin receptions, lectures students, publishes books, and appears in the media as an expert on U.S.-Russia relations.

But it's his bleak forecast for the U.S. that is music to the ears of the Kremlin, which in recent years has blamed Washington for everything from instability in the Middle East to the global financial crisis. Mr. Panarin's views also fit neatly with the Kremlin's narrative that Russia is returning to its rightful place on the world stage after the weakness of the 1990s, when many feared that the country would go economically and politically bankrupt and break into separate territories.

A polite and cheerful man with a buzz cut, Mr. Panarin insists he does not dislike Americans. But he warns that the outlook for them is dire.

""There's a 55-45% chance right now that disintegration will occur,"" he says. ""One could rejoice in that process,"" he adds, poker-faced. ""But if we're talking reasonably, it's not the best scenario -- for Russia."" Though Russia would become more powerful on the global stage, he says, its economy would suffer because it currently depends heavily on the dollar and on trade with the U.S.

Mr. Panarin posits, in brief, that mass immigration, economic decline, and moral degradation will trigger a civil war next fall and the collapse of the dollar. Around the end of June 2010, or early July, he says, the U.S. will break into six pieces -- with Alaska reverting to Russian control.”

In these most darkest of times, and as the fate of America now hangs in the balance, one can only hope that her people will awaken, and in their awakening arise together, as the one people that they are, so that when the history of these times are written, and though many of them will become their own “Gray Champions”, a new and better Nation may be born again.

367,"Strange things are afoot in the animal kingdom. In Sweden, a 16-inch “Ratzilla” burrowed into a family’s home and terrorized them for weeks. In Canada, a two-legged dog jogged down the beach as if it were a human. Our sense of what is possible is expanding every day – could the cryptids, those legendary monsters of folklore, have more grounding in scientific fact than previously assumed?

Probably not. But it’s April Fools’ Day, and that means we can have just as much fun fooling ourselves as we do other people. After all, the world is a more interesting place with these creatures in it.

Join us below as we explore the most intriguing cryptid sightings of 2014 – if they’re real, might they be hiding in your backyard?

The legend of the Chupacabra – a bloodsucking monster that preys on livestock – continues to haunt the Southwest, most recently in March, when a Texas family claimed to have shot and killed a real Chupacabra. With its terrifying teeth and unholy grimace, the animal’s corpse certainly fits the Chupcabra’s description, but local authorities, their hearts dead to the magic of the West, say the creature was likely a local predator infected by Sarcoptic mange.

Bigfoot enthusiasts received a disappointing blow to their efforts on March 28, when self-proclaimed “best Bigfoot tracker in the world” Rick Dyer admitted that his two-year publicity campaign to convince the world he’d killed the beast was a lie. This was the second time Dyer admitted to lying about killing the legendary monster, which raises the question of why anyone trusted him in the first place.

Still, Bigfoot claims are like the Hydra: Knock one down and another three grow in its place. 2014 has already seen Bigfoot sightings in Detroit, Vermont and Maine.

As you may guess from its delightfully folksy moniker, the Yowie is the Australian analogue to Bigfoot, a gigantic hominid rumored to hide in the Australian bush. Given Australia’s remarkable biodiversity and relatively low population density, the Yowie might be slightly easier to believe in than its American relative, particularly among the numerous travelers who have recently reported seeing it in the New South Wales outback.

Conspiracy theorist David Icke has popularized the theory that several world leaders are actually reptilians in disguise, but less cynical cryptid fans have reported seeing lizard people wandering the wilderness in their natural skin, far from the corridors of power. Typical is this account from February, in which a trio of bikers reported encountering a six-foot-tall reptile with clawed hands and snake eyes while traveling through the Arizona desert.

“When you read these stories online or watch them on TV, you think, ‘Man, these people are crazy, or on meds or something,'” CryptoZoologyNews.com quoted one of the bikers as saying. “This story has made me a believer.”

What’s Portugese for “spooky-scary?” The Brazilian Internet blew up in February after security footage of what appeared to be a terrifying wolf figure, complete with tales of frightened locals and security lockdowns, went viral.

The rumors were finally stopped by the Internet equivalent of a silver bullet: A few skeptical sleuths, who noticed that the video dated back to at least 2007. Officials in the town reportedly terrorized by the werewolf said they had no knowledge of any such creature – of course, that’s what they would say.

If a body of water is large enough and deep enough, eventually people are going to start worrying there are monsters in it. The most recent rumblings come from Russia, where a team of scientists has been studying Siberia’s Lake Labynkyr, hoping to find evidence of a mysterious sea creature that fascinated the media in 2013. (Initial reports that those divers found a large jawbone at the bottom of the lake have not been confirmed.)

774,"The very definition of Hypocrisy can be summed up in two words, Nancy Pelosi. Her life and understanding of how the world operates is confined to two “bubbles,” One in Washington, D.C., the other in San Francisco, California. The “air” inside both bubbles has the stench of Political corruption and fallout from Self Serving actions by an elected official and supposed “public servant.” (Cough, cough… wow, the air is bad in there.)

Not only is Pelosi the “Calendar Girl” (please leave the clothes on) of Liberalism, she is exactly what is wrong with The Political Establishment and why so many ‘left leaning’ voters joined the Republicans and elected Donald Trump as President.

Pelosi would have been retired long ago to the La Brea Tar Pits in Southern California, along with the other prehistoric times, if she and husband Paul had not made and kept promises to the “wealthiest businesses and corporations” with headquarters in SFO.

“Pelosi [..] one of the most liberal members of the U.S. House, where she runs the Democratic caucus, railing against income inequality and the avarice of the 1 percent. But she also happens to be one of the body’s wealthiest members: In Washington, she lives in a multimillion-dollar Georgetown condo; she owns a 16-acre vineyard in Napa Valley and a 3,700 square-foot house in San Francisco’s tony Pacific Heights..”

“.. financial-disclosure statements, [..] place her in the top one-tenth of the 1 percent of Americans, [that] may surprise some in light of the concern she’s expressed about income equality and the distribution of wealth.

“We’re talking about addressing the disparity in our country of income, where the wealthy people continue to get wealthier,” Pelosi said in 2010 at a United Steelworkers’ event. “That disparity is not just about wages alone,” she added. “That disparity is about ownership and equity. It’s all about fairness in our country.”

At this point we are not going to continue pointing out the hypocrisy Pelosi practices in her personal and business affairs as it is available on line to even the most casual researcher. (Have barf-bag at the ready.)

Short and sweet… Nancy calls out Trump about an alleged Russian Connection without talking about hers.

Nancy says Trump is not competent to be President? Really Nancy? (More Hypocrisy)

756,"The sea cows were first described by the German naturalist Georg Steller in the 18th century. Steller was part of an expedition organized led by the Danish explorer Vitus Bering. Financed by the Imperial Russian government, its mission was to chart the waters between Siberia and North America, and find a workable route between the two if possible.

The expedition set sail from Kamchatka in June of 1741. A few weeks later, they had reached Alaska. Bering allowed Steller a single day to search for new species. In that brief time, his only visit to the North American continent, Steller managed to name several species of bird, including Steller’s Jay, ubiquitous in the hills behind my Berkeley apartment. By the beginning of winter, the two ships that made up the expedition had become separated, two landing parties had vanished, and so many sailors on Bering’s flagship had scurvy that they could barely man the sails.

In November, the St. Peter ran aground on an uninhabited island. Many of members of the expedition thought that it was attached to the Siberian mainland and that they would eventually be able to walk to safety, but they were soon proven wrong. A short time after reaching land, the ship broke apart in a storm, and the captain died of scurvy. Steller, who knew how to combat the Vitamin C–deficiency by foraging for herbs, was one of the few crew members still in good health.

Steller quickly realized that the landmass they were on was an island, and one that likely had never been visited by human beings before. Everywhere he went, he was followed by foxes, which showed no fear but eagerly stole any implements or food they could grab in their jaws. One day, walking along the beach searching for firewood, he saw a huge, black shape moving slowly about in the shallows like an overturned boat. Every few minutes a snout would surface for a moment and draw breath with a noise like a horse’s snort. This was the sea cow, seen by the human eyes for the first time in thousands of years. Steller was shocked to realize that this creature was a type of manatee, thousands of miles from its nearest relatives in the tropics. He describes the sea cows as gentle giants, whose only real defense against being harpooned was their incredibly thick hides. He also notes that they seem to have been unusually loyal to one another, which proved to be more of a liability than an asset when the Russians began hunting them for food. They had, in his words, “an uncommon love for one another, which even extended so far that, when one of them was hooked, all the others were intent upon saving him.” When the Russians harpooned one of the sea cows, others would come to its defense, making a circle around their wounded comrade.

The discovery of Morgan’s sphinx moth, which had a tongue just long enough (and no longer), proved Darwin right — some two decades after his death.

It’s one of the great demonstrations of evolution by natural selection. But what naturalists really want is to catch natural selection in the act, as it’s doing the selecting. That’s much harder, and a bit of luck is needed.

Opportunity knocked at the door of biologist Colin Donihue at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a year ago, just after he and his colleagues had returned from Pine Cay and Water Cay, two small islands in the Turks and Caicos archipelago to the north of the Caribbean, where they had been studying the lives and times of its resident anole lizards (Anolis scriptus).

On 8 September last year, Hurricane Irma struck the islands, battering them with sustained winds of up to 265 kilometres per hour. Irma was the first category-5 hurricane on record to strike the region, but more was to come: two weeks later, Hurricane Maria swept across the islands with winds of up to 200 kilometres per hour. Dozens of people in the region died. Reconstruction and rebuilding efforts continue.

Read the paper: Hurricane-induced selection on the morphology of an island lizard

Three weeks after the winds had died down, the researchers were back on Pine Cay and Water Cay to assess the damage, and to see how (or even if) their lizards had survived. Their study, published this week in Nature, is the first to use an immediate before-and-after comparison to assess the impacts of hurricanes on evolutionary selection (C. M. Donihue et al. Nature http://doi.org/csgp; 2018).

Serendipity can go only so far. The researchers hadn’t marked the lizards, so they couldn’t identify and track the fate of individuals. But they found clear trends of natural selection in action. In general, anoles found after the storms had bigger toepads, longer forelimbs and shorter hindlimbs than did lizards collected before the storm.

What have these traits to do with hurricanes? The lizards live in bushes and other low-growing vegetation. Toepads allow them purchase on the branches as they move, and it’s a fair bet that limb proportions also play a part in helping a lizard to keep in contact with a branch, resisting moves by predators, other lizards — or, as it turned out, hurricanes — to knock them off.

The researchers took their idea further with a simple laboratory experiment, in which they allowed lizards to get settled on a perch and then blew them off using a commercial leaf blower, recording the speed at which the lizards were dislodged. (The lizards flew into comfy padding, and were not injured in the experiments.)

This experiment supported the researchers’ hypothesis. In particular, it showed that when lizards are subjected to a stiff breeze, they hang on tightly with their forelimbs and let their hindlimbs hang loose. Longer hindlimbs, then, offer more purchase to the winds, explaining why lizards found after the storms tended to have shorter hindlimbs, but longer forelimbs.

These bigger toepads, shorter hindlimbs and longer forelimbs did not evolve as a direct response to the hurricanes, but they show how such evolution occurs. Natural selection interfered with the way in which these traits were spread across the population. Specifically, those lizards unable to hang on when the storms blew up — those with smaller toepads, longer hindlimbs and shorter forelimbs — were (presumably) blown away and perished. Those lizards better able to hang on tightly would have survived to weather another day. In technical terms, the mean values of the crucial traits measured before the storms had shifted. These changes are phenotypic — merely observable characteristics. They say nothing about the genetic assimilation of such changes, which will presumably happen when the surviving lizards breed and new lizards are recruited to the population. Such changes are unlikely to be the last, given the expected increases in extreme weather that the future will bring.",mainstream,M0ad5c,big.foot
351,"Why on earth would the US government conspire to cover up any kind of archaeological findings? Of what possible threat could honest, scientific discovery pose to national security or the common good?

Yet, this is exactly what happened when American diggers found skeletal remains of oversize humans: giants.

Disclose.tv reported earlier this year on a story that was ridiculed and debunked as soon as it was made public some decades ago: that the Smithsonian Institution destroyed thousands of giant human skeletons.

The World News Daily Report was the first publication to claim that the US cover-up of giant human remains began in the early 1900s. (It is entirely possible that earlier cases will be found, in the future.)

This leading scientific organization responded to allegations of their deceitful actions by filing a lawsuit to protect their sterling reputation. The Event Chronicle fills in the details:

“A US Supreme Court ruling has forced the Smithsonian institution to release classified papers dating from the early 1900’s that proves the organization was involved in a major historical cover-up of evidence showing giants human remains in the tens of thousands had been uncovered all across America and were ordered to be destroyed by high-level administrators to protect the mainstream chronology of human evolution at the time.

“The allegations stemming from the American Institution of Alternative Archeology (AIAA) that the Smithsonian Institution had destroyed thousands of giant human remains during the early 1900’s was not taken lightly by the Smithsonian who responded by suing the organization for defamation and trying to damage the reputation of the 168-year old institution.

“…Smithsonian whistle blowers admitted to the existence of documents that allegedly proved the destruction of tens of thousands of human skeletons reaching between 6 feet and 12 feet in height, a reality mainstream archeology can not admit to for different reasons, claims AIAA spokesman, James Churward.”

Honestly, covering up the existence of giants on earth, in order to preserve a theory that explains how humans came to inhabit North America, makes very little sense: who stands to gain, and who stands to lose?

Could it be that the US leadership decided that the citizenry would freak out from the news of giants who lived in the distant past?

The Bible (Genesis 6:4) states very matter-of-factly: “There were giants in the Earth in those days” – as if contemporary readers knew this to be true, undoubtedly from the passage of oral tradition. Great warriors like Goliath (bested by David and his sling) were described, and the locations of giants’ kingdoms were disclosed.

Many other civilizations around the world have “myths” about giants, as listed in this fascinating article by an unnamed author. American immigrants brought their cultural heritages with them.

But a folk tale is a far cry from scientific rigor. So why the modern cover-up of actual physical evidence that supports those “children’s stories?”

One mundane explanation would be that influential (as in, wealthy), mainstream archaeologists wanted to maintain their scientific supremacy, and persuaded the federal government to help perpetuate the lie that giants never existed anywhere in the world, much less in the continental US. After all, schools taught that the earliest American inhabitants trekked over a Bering Strait land bridge – over the north pole, nearly – into modern-day Alaska a mere 15,000 years ago. Perhaps the scientific community “needed to be right?”

Fortunately for Us the People, with the age of the internet and instant, global communication the Truth is becoming harder and harder to hide.

In this century, the oldest human fossils – not gigantic, by the way – have been found in northern Africa (Jebel Irhoud, Morocco). These remains date to around 315,000 years old, as The Atlantic Daily, Nature, and other scientific publications have reported!

Archaeological discoveries keep pushing the date of human (homo sapiens sapiens, that is) origin further and further back in time.

These dates happen to jive with ancient source texts that discuss human origin, notably the Sumerian clay tablets translated by Zecharia Sitchin. This Azerbaijani-born American researcher and author upset the anthropological world with his revelation that humans had been bred by an off-world race called the Annunaki – “alien overlords” (in this case, the term actually does fit) – to serve them, especially to mine gold in the hot African sun.

Just as the Bible later described, the Annunaki – or “fallen angels” – bred with human women and birthed…a race of giants called the Nephilim. The giants had big appetites, and devoured all the crops and livestock before turning to humans as their next food source. At this point, the Annunaki admitted that the Nephilim had gotten out of hand, and flooded the earth as a global Mulligan (“do-over”) – kind of like shaking an Etch-a-Sketch upside down in order to “clean the slate.”

Now, this is where the conspiracy about giants gets interesting. Sitchin’s work continues to be refuted by “experts,” even as more archaeological evidence of beings with elongated skulls, giants and ancient African gold mines inhabited by early humans continues to pile up.

Is the New World Order actually threatened by a citizenry that is fully aware of our alien-hybridized human origin?

If people, collectively, understood that we were created to serve ETs (termed “gods” in ancient texts), how would that change our society and others around the world?

Ignoring the Illuminati agenda, alternative news sources continue to report similar “gigantic” findings from around the world. To cite just a couple: “Nephilim Bones and Giant Human Skeletons in Greece” and “Skeletons of 5,000-year-old Chinese ‘giants’ discovered by archaeologists.”

Regardless of the “why” behind yet another government discovery/lie/cover-up, it is clear that, in those days, yeah – there really were giants.",conspiracy,C03510,big.foot; illuminati

478,"The start of the northern meteorological winter on December 1 will bring with it short days of darkness, blistering cold and frigid blizzards. For many people, this is the dreariest time of the year. But for a small niche of water-happy athletes, winter is a time to play, as ferocious storms send rippling rings of energy outward through the ocean. By the time they reach distant shores, these swells have matured into clean, polished waves that barrel in with a cold and ceaseless military rhythm; they touch bottom, slow, build and, finally, collapse in spectacular curls and thundering white water. These are the things of dreams for surfers, many of whom travel the planet, pursuing giant breakers. And surfers aren’t the only ones with their eyes on the water—for surfing has become a popular spectator sport. At many famed breaks, bluffs on the shore provide fans with thrilling views of the action. The waves alone are awesome—so powerful they may seem to shake the earth. But when a tiny human figure on a board as flimsy as a matchstick appears on the face of that incoming giant, zigzagging forward as the wave curls overhead and threatens to crush him, spines tingle, hands come together in prayer, and jaws drop. Whether you like the water or not, big-wave surfing is one of the most thrilling shows on the planet.

The birth of big-wave surfing was an incremental process that began in the 1930s and ’40s in Hawaii, especially along the north-facing shores of the islands. Here, 15-foot waves were once considered giants, and anything much bigger just eye candy. But wave at a time, surfers stoked up their courage and ambition. They surfed on bigger days, used lighter and lighter boards that allowed swifter paddling and hunted for breaks that consistently produced monsters. One by one, big-wave spots were cataloged, named and ranked, and wave at a time, records were set. In November 1957, big-wave pioneer Greg Noll rode an estimated 25-footer in Waimea Bay, Oahu. In 1969, Noll surfed what was probably a 30-plus-footer, but no verified photos exist of the wave, and thus no means of determining its height. Fast-forwarding a few decades, Mike Parsons caught a 66-foot breaker in 2001 at Cortes Bank, 115 miles off San Diego, where a seamount rises to within three feet of the surface. In 2008, Parsons was back at the same place and caught a 77-footer. But Garrett McNamara outdid Parsons and set the current record in November 2011, when he rode a 78-foot wave off the coast of Portugal, at the town of Nazare.

But these later records may not have been possible without the assistance of jet skis, which have become a common and controversial element in the pursuit of giant waves. The vehicles first began appearing in the surf during big-wave events in the early 1990s, and for all their noise and stench, their appeal was undeniable: Jet skis made it possible to access waves 40 feet and bigger, and whose scale had previously been too grand for most unassisted surfers to reach by paddling. Though tow-in surfing has given a boost to the record books, it has also heightened the danger of surfing, and many surfers have died in big waves they might never have attempted without jet-ski assistance. Not surprisingly, many surfers have rejected tow-in surfing as an affront to the purity of their relationship with waves—and they still manage to catch monsters. In March 2011, Shane Dorian rode a 57-foot breaker at the famed Jaws break in Maui, unassisted by a belching two-stroke engine. But many big-wave riders fully endorse tow-in surfing as a natural evolution of the sport. Surfing supertstar Laird Hamilton has even blown off purists who continue to paddle after big waves without jet skis as “moving backward.” Anyway, in a sport that relies heavily on satellite imagery, Internet swell forecasts and red-eye flights to Honolulu, are we really complaining about a little high-tech assistance?

For those wishing merely to watch big waves and the competitors that gather to ride them, all that is needed is a picnic blanket and binoculars—and perhaps some help from this swell forecast website. Following are some superb sites to watch surfers catch the biggest breakers in the world this winter.

Waimea Bay, North Shore of Oahu. Big-wave surfing was born here, largely fueled by the fearless vision of Greg Noll in the 1950s. The definition of “big” for extreme surfers has grown since the early days, yet Waimea still holds its own. Fifty-foot waves can occur here—events that chase all but the best wave riders from the water. When conditions allow, elite surfers participate in the recurring Quicksilver Eddie Aikau Invitational. Spectators teem on the shore during big-swell periods, and while surfers may fight for their ride, you may have to fight for your view. Get there early.

Jaws, North Shore of Maui. Also known as Peahi, Jaws produces some of the most feared and attractive waves on earth. The break—where 50-footers and bigger appear almost every year—is almost strictly a tow-in site, but rebel paddle-by-hand surfers do business here, too. Twenty-one pros have been invited to convene at Jaws this winter for a paddle-in competition sometime between December 7 and March 15. Spectators are afforded a great view of the action on a high nearby bluff. But go early, as hundreds will be in line for the best viewing points. Also, bring binoculars, as the breakers crash almost a mile offshore.

Mavericks, Half Moon Bay, California. Mavericks gained its reputation in the 1980s and ’90s, during the revival of big-wave surfing, which lost some popularity in the 1970s. Named for a German Shepherd named Maverick who took a surgy swim here in 1961, the site (which gained an “s” but never an official apostrophe) generates some of the biggest surfable waves in the world. Today, surfing competitions, like the Mavericks Big Wave Contest and the Mavericks Invitational, are held each year. The waves of Mavericks crash on a vicious reef, making them predictable (sandy bottoms will shift and change the wave form) but nonetheless hazardous. One of the best surfers of his time, Mark Foo died here in 1994 when his ankle leash is believed to have snagged on the bottom. Later, the waves claimed the life of Hawaiian surfing star Sion Milosky. A high bluff above the beach offers a view of the action. As at Jaws, bring binoculars.

Ghost Trees, Monterey Peninsula, California. This break hits peak form under the same swell conditions that get things roaring at Mavericks, just a three-hour drive north. Ghost Trees is a relatively new attraction for big-wave riders. Veteran surfer Don Curry says he first saw it surfed in 1974. Decades would pass before it became famous, and before it killed pro surfer (and a pioneer of nearby Mavericks) Peter Davi in 2007. For surfing spectators, there are few places quite like Ghost Trees. The waves, which can hit 50 feet and more, break just a football field’s length from shore.

Mullaghmore Head, Ireland. Far from the classic Pacific shores of big-wave legend and history, Mullaghmore Head comes alive during winter storms in the North Atlantic. The location produces waves big enough that surfing here has become primarily a jet ski-assisted game. In fact, the event period for the Billabong Tow-In Session at Mullaghmore began on November 1 and will run through February 2013. Just how big is Mullaghmore Head? On March 8, 2012, the waves here reached 50 feet, as determined by satellite measurements. A grassy headland provides an elevated platform from which to see the show. Bundle up if you go, and expect cold, blustery conditions.

Teahupoo, Tahiti. This coveted break blooms with big swells from the Southern Ocean—usually during the southern winter. Teahupoo is famed for its classic tube breakers.

Shipsterns Bluff, Tasmania. Watch for this point’s giants to break from June through September.

Punta de Lobos, Chile. Channeling the energy of the Southern Ocean into huge but glassy curlers, Punta de Lobos breaks at its best in March and April.

Todos Santos Island, Baja California, Mexico. Todos Santos Island features several well-known breaks, but “Killers” is the biggest and baddest. The surf usually peaks in the northern winter.

There is another sort of wave that thrills tourists and spectators: the tidal bore. These moon-induced phenomena occur with regularity at particular locations around the world. The most spectacular to see include the tidal bores of Hangzhou Bay, China, and Araguari, Brazil—each of which has become a popular surfing event.",mainstream,M0c897,big.foot
1319,"What is a man like Joe doing with Bigfoot? Joe is a mexicano who knew some of the same Spanish folktales that Juan B. Rael had collected many years earlier in the area around Antonito, Colorado. I found Joe in his store of “collectables” on Main Street. His store was a little community center where people from town dropped in to talk about the news of the day. Joe is a lot like his father, Anastacio, whose boot‐making shop had also become a little community center. Joe remembers sheepherders complaining to his father that the police had stolen their money. The sheepherders came to town to collect their pay and go on a bender. They deposited most of their money with the cops who pocketed it for themselves and denied having received it. Anastacio wasn't afraid of confronting the cops. Joe's dad was a valorista , or brave man of his word who defended the weak against the strong.

Joe told me the folktales he had learned from his parents and then nudged me in a different direction. He took me to his backyard shed, pulled out a dusty box of manuscripts he had written in long hand and asked me to read them. Joe liked to read western novels by Louis L'amour and emulated that author's style. One of the manuscripts was a story about Bigfoot. I knew about his interest in the creature because he had shown us a video he and his son had taken of large footprints with an unusually long gait in the snow south of town. Joe did not see the creature that made them, and so he sought out others who had. Several had caught fleeting glimpses of something crossing Highway 285 in the cut just across the New Mexico border. A woodcutter said he found the cave where Bigfoot lives. A rancher said he came face to face with the creature in the Hansen Creek area in the San Juan Wilderness west of town. That same rancher added that many Bigfoot live in the llano between two dormant volcanoes, Mt. San Antonio south of town and Ute Mountain to the east.

At first I didn't understand why a man like Joe, who spent his life fighting for his raza would care so much about proving the existence of Bigfoot. Didn't the creature come from mass media, and weren't most enthusiasts white working class men on the wrong side of the Civil Rights struggle? Joe has stood up for the underdog his entire life. He worked as a business agent for the union presenting grievances to the Miner brothers who managed the Perlite plant south of town. Joe said: “They had my raza down in the lower paying jobs sweeping and doing the cleaning and all the hard labor. Bud Miner hated to see me coming. He told me: ‘I'm tired of you Mexicans coming over here and trying to tell us what to do.’”

There is a lot of chicanery connected with this North American wildman, and so I shied away from the subject at first. Every time we returned to Antonito, Joe told me he had found another person who had seen footprints or caught a fleeting glimpse of the creature. An Anglo showed some photographs of footprints he had taken with his cell phone camera. We held two Bigfoot parties in our Antonito home with people whose testimonies Joe considered believable. We followed them up with interviews in their homes. Joe will talk to anyone who has seen Bigfoot. It doesn't matter to him if they are Anglos or mexicanos. He knows from watching television that Bigfoot researchers are mainly Anglos.

Joe cobbled together what he learned from the witnesses to write his story, which he says is “pure fiction.” The central protagonist, Marc Gomez, is Joe's idea of a mexicano everyman who has lost touch with his ancestors. Marc is 39, just divorced from his wife, retired after 20 years in the army, and is living in Los Angeles. He loves to read western paperback novels about New Mexico and is ready for a change. He packs up his Air Stream trailer, hitches it to his Bronco, and heads toward the Land of Enchantment. Marc, like Joe himself, sets out on a quest to find Bigfoot after he dreamt of giant faceless creatures running after him on a forsaken prairie. He heads up Highway 285 and overhears, on his CB radio, a conversation between truckers one of whom says: “Some animal came out of the bar pit. I'm sure I hit it with my back wheels. Looked like a bear or something big.” Marc follows leads to an old mexicano sheepherder who lives in Velarde, New Mexico, who ran into the creature on the llano near Ute Mountain. The sheepherder has a daughter, Cristina, and she becomes Marc's lover and companion, and together they enter Bigfoot's world in the volcanic caverns under the llano. Marc and Cristina discover the creature's world is like that of humans above the llano. The strong prey on the weak in both places. Marc and Cristina show they are both valoristas by defending the weaker Bigfoot from the stronger ones who attempt to enslave them.

Each witness we interviewed had a particular take on the creature. They said he is peaceful, adapted, intelligent looking, strong, massive but graceful, and proud. Some say he is a loner, and others say he lives in families. Those with greater knowledge of the environment speak with more authority. The mexicanos I know tell and write stories about Bigfoot to claim their rightful place on a llano they share with others.",mainstream,M1306a,big.foot

940,"What Would Happen If A Giant Tsunami Hit Florida?

Can you imagine the devastation that would be caused if a massive wall of water several hundred feet high slammed into Florida at more than 100 miles an hour? To many people such a scenario is impossible, but that is what people living along the Indian Ocean thought before the 2004 tsunami and that is what people living in Japan thought before the 2011 tsunami.

Throughout history, giant tsunamis have been relatively rare events, but they do happen. Scientists tell us that a mega-tsunami can race across the open ocean at up to 500 miles an hour, and when they reach shore they can produce waves that are hundreds of feet high. And even though authorities claim that the threat to Florida is “remote”, it might surprise you to learn that there are “Tsunami Hazard Zone” signs on Florida beaches. If a highly unusual event (such as a giant meteor hitting the Atlantic Ocean) caused a giant tsunami that hit Florida, the devastation would be absolutely unimaginable.

Most people don’t realize this, but almost the entire bottom half of Florida is just barely above sea level. If a giant tsunami did hit Florida, there would be nothing to stop it from sweeping across the entire state…

South Florida has two big problems. The first is its remarkably flat topography. Half the area that surrounds Miami is less than five feet above sea level. Its highest natural elevation, a limestone ridge that runs from Palm Beach to just south of the city, averages a scant 12 feet. With just three feet of sea-level rise, more than a third of southern Florida will vanish; at six feet, more than half will be gone; if the seas rise 12 feet, South Florida will be little more than an isolated archipelago surrounded by abandoned buildings and crumbling overpasses. And the waters won’t just come in from the east – because the region is so flat, rising seas will come in nearly as fast from the west too, through the Everglades. Even worse, South Florida sits above a vast and porous limestone plateau. “Imagine Swiss cheese, and you’ll have a pretty good idea what the rock under southern Florida looks like,” says Glenn Landers, a senior engineer at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This means water moves around easily – it seeps into yards at high tide, bubbles up on golf courses, flows through underground caverns, corrodes building foundations from below. “Conventional sea walls and barriers are not effective here,” says Robert Daoust, an ecologist at ARCADIS, a Dutch firm that specializes in engineering solutions to rising seas.

Of course the authorities do all that they can to play down this potential threat. They say that it is “highly unlikely” that a tsunami will ever hit Florida. The following comes from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection…

Although it is highly unlikely that a tsunami will impact Florida, it is not impossible. Floridians may also travel to locations where tsunamis are more likely. It is vital to know (and instruct children) that if the ocean suddenly recedes from the shore do not stand and stare. It is necessary immediately to run uphill or away from the shore and go to the highest location possible which may mean up the stairs of a substantial building. Everyone should be aware that no matter where in the world they are, if the sea is observed to recede from the shore, they should immediately run for high ground.

That last part is quite funny. There is no “high ground” until you get to north Florida. If a mega-tsunami strikes, there is going to be no place to hide.

And large tsunamis do happen in the Atlantic Ocean from time to time. For example, National Geographic says that there have been 37 verified tsunamis in the Caribbean since 1498…

In recent years, there have been some scientists that have been concerned about what would happen if there was a major earthquake in the Caribbean region or a volcanic eruption in the Canary Islands. The following comes from CBS News…

Meteorologist Bart Hagemeyer from the National Weather Service says an earthquake in the Caribbean region is likely to project wave energy more to the north and less toward Florida. But the direction can vary and much of the outcome depends on the amount of energy released by the earthquake. The highly unlikely tsunami that Florida might keep in mind could come from across the Atlantic, created by the collapse of a volcano in the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa, say experts. For years, some have thought that the unstable volcanic structures in the Canary Islands would cause massive tsunamis to slam into the East Coast of the U.S. if they crumbled into the sea. That would have the potential of a not just a garden-variety of tsunami, but a “mega-tsunami,” according to Hagemeyer.

So what would such a “mega-tsunami” look like?

Well, according to Dr. Simon Day and Dr. Steven Ward, it could produce a wall of water approximately 164 feet high…

Dr Day, working in conjunction with Dr Steven Ward of the University of California, has now produced an updated model that predicts more accurately the size of the tsunami and the areas it will impact. The model predicts that after the landslide the tsunami would travel a distance of almost 155 miles in just 10 minutes and would reach the Caribbean and Florida in eight or nine hours. The forecast goes on to predict that a wall of water 164ft high could smash into the coasts of the Caribbean and Florida, while Brazil’s northern coast could be hit by a wave more than 130ft high.

Personally, however, I am convinced that the much greater potential threat comes from above.

According to the University of California at Santa Cruz website, if a massive asteroid were to crash into the Atlantic Ocean it could produce a giant tsunami with a wall of water as high as 400 feet that would slam into the east coast of the United States…

In case you were wondering, yes, that would be absolutely catastrophic.

Major U.S. cities stretching from the tip of Florida all the way up to Maine would essentially be destroyed. The following is an excerpt from an article posted on Modern Survival Blog…

300 foot tsunami would be the probable devastation of the following major East Coast cities… Portland, ME (~ 50′)

Over one third of the country (more than 100 million people) live along the East Coast. Evacuation would be virtually impossible for most (except for the astute who act quickly) due to only hours notice, probable doubt, and the subsequent immediate gridlock that would follow.

Most scientists would tell you that the possibility of such a thing is extremely small.

But could it be possible that they are wrong?

At this point, more than 10,000 major near earth objects have been discovered, and about 10 percent of them are one kilometer or larger in size.

And there are many more out there that are still undiscovered. In fact, scientists are discovering new ones all the time.

Sometimes, astronomers only spot them after they have passed our planet.

What is even more alarming is that the number of “fireball events” that are being recorded appears to be greatly increasing. Just check out this chart from the American Meteor Society…

So why is this happening?

Why are so many large rocks suddenly flying by so close to our planet?

And what is going to happen when a really giant rock slams into us one day?

943,"Why Wheat is One of the Worst Carbs for Your Health

Technically speaking, wheat is a grain containing carbohydrates. It makes up most of our noodles and breads that are the source of most carbohydrates in our diet. Modern wheat really isn’t wheat at all and far from the health food the wheat industry wants you to believe it is. High-yielding and now genetically modified varieties of wheat are making this one cereal grain you’ll probably want to axe from your food list.

So how–and when–did this ancient grain become such a serious health threat? Author and preventive cardiologist William Davis, MD, says it’s when big agriculture stepped in decades ago to develop a higher-yielding crop. Today’s “wheat,” he says, isn’t even wheat, thanks to some of the most intense crossbreeding efforts ever seen. “The wheat products sold to you today are nothing like the wheat products of our grandmother’s age, very different from the wheat of the early 20th Century, and completely transformed from the wheat of the Bible and earlier,” he says.

Plant breeders changed wheat in dramatic ways. Once more than four feet tall, modern wheat–the type grown in 99 percent of wheat fields around the world–is now a stocky two-foot-tall plant with an unusually large seed head. Dr. Davis says accomplishing this involved crossing wheat with non-wheat grasses to introduce altogether new genes, using techniques like irradiation of wheat seeds and embryos with chemicals, gamma rays, and high-dose X-rays to induce mutations.



Australian researchers have now revealed serious issues over a new kind of genetically engineered wheat that could induce major health threats for people that consume it. University of Canterbury Professor Jack Heinemann announced the outcomes of his genetic study into the wheat, a kind engineered by Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

Additional claims came from researchers in Australia to have developed a form of salt-tolerant wheat that would allow farmers to grow crops in soil with high salinity.

Japan’s flour companies are also rejecting GM wheat, echoing consumer opposition. In a statement released today, the Flour Miller’s Association of Japan wrote to the No! GMO Campaign indicating its opposition.

“Under the present circumstances, with all the doubts about safety and the environment that the consumers in Japan have, including the effect on the human body from GM foods, GM wheat is included among the items that are not acceptable for the Japanese market,” Kadota Masaaki, senior managing director of the Flour Miller’s Association wrote to the No! GMO Campaign.

The Nutrional Value of Wheat is Practically Non-Existent

 In Its Current Form

So-called health experts in nutrition who continue to promote the health benefits of wheat are extremely uninformed about the nature of modern wheat and its evolution from growth to consumption. It is shocking how many professionals in public health still recommend wheat products without an assessment of their individual requirements, especially considering the amount of evidence regarding its lack of nutrition and health risks for proportionally large segments of the population.

The majority of wheat is processed into 60% extraction, bleached white flour. 60% extraction–the standard for most wheat products means that 40% of the original wheat grain is removed. So not only do we have an unhealthier, modified, and hybridized strain of wheat, we also remove and further degrade its nutritional value by processing it. Unfortunately, the 40% that gets removed includes the bran and the germ of the wheat grain–its most nutrient-rich parts. In the process of making 60% extraction flour, over half of the vitamin B1, B2, B3, E, folic acid, calcium, phosphorus, zinc, copper, iron, and fiber are lost. Any processed foods with wheat are akin to poison for the body since they cause more health risks than benefits. The body does not recognize processed wheat as food. Nutrient absorption from processed wheat products is thus consequential with almost no nutritional value.

Some experts claim if you select 100% whole wheat products, the bran and the germ of the wheat will remain in your meals, and the health benefits will be impressive. This is again a falsity promoted by the wheat industry since even 100% whole wheat products are based on modern wheat strains created by irradiation of wheat seeds and embryos with chemicals, gamma rays, and high-dose X-rays to induce mutations. Whether you consume 10% or 100% of wheat is irrelevant since you’re still consuming a health damaging grain that will not benefit, advance or even maintain your health in any way.

Dr. Marcia Alvarez who specializes in nutritional programs for obese patients says that when it comes to nutrition, wheat may be considered as an evil grain. “Modern wheat grains could certainly be considered as the root of all evil in the world of nutrition since they cause so many documented health problems across so many populations in the world.” Dr. Alvarez asserted that wheat is now responsible for more intolerances than almost any other food in the world. “In my practice of over two decades, we have documented that for every ten people with digestive problems, obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes, arthritis and even heart disease, eight out of ten have a problem with wheat. Once we remove wheat from their diets, most of their symptoms disappear within three to six months,” she added. Dr. Alvarez estimates that between the coming influx of genetically modified (GM) strains of wheat and the current tendency of wheat elimination in societies, that a trend is emerging in the next 20 years that will likely see 80% of people cease their consumption of wheat from any form.

A powerful little chemical in wheat known as ‘wheat germ agglutinin’ (WGA) which is largely responsible for many of wheat’s pervasive, and difficult to diagnose, ill effects. Researchers are now discovering that WGA in modern wheat is very different from ancient strains. Not only does WGA throw a monkey wrench into our assumptions about the primary causes of wheat intolerance, but due to the fact that WGA is found in highest concentrations in “whole wheat,” including its supposedly superior sprouted form, it also pulls the rug out from under one of the health food industry’s favorite poster children.

Evidence is mounting that a significant percentage of the population is sensitive to gluten.

When we eat bread that contains gluten (wheat, spelt, rye and barley), the immune system in our digestive tract “attacks” the gluten proteins.

Gluten sensitivity is also associated with some cases of schizophrenia and cerebellar ataxia – both serious disorders of the brain.

Gluten is probably harmful for most people, not just those with diagnosed celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.

The only way to really know if you’re gluten sensitive is to remove gluten from your diet for 30 days and then reintroduce it and see whether it affects you.

Each grain of wheat contains about one microgram of Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA). Even in small quantities, WGA can have profoundly adverse effects. It may be pro-inflammatory, immunotoxic, cardiotoxic … and neurotoxic.

Below the radar of conventional serological testing for antibodies against the various gluten proteins and genetic testing for disease susceptibility, the WGA “lectin problem” remains almost entirely obscured. Lectins, though found in all grains, seeds, legumes, dairy and our beloved nightshades: the tomato and potato, are rarely discussed in connection with health or illness, even when their presence in our diet may greatly reduce both the quality and length of our lives. Yet health experts dismiss the links between disease and wheat despite all the evidence.

Dr William Davis has documented several hundred clinical studies on the adverse effects of wheat. These are studies that document the neurologic impairments unique to wheat, including cerebellar ataxia and dementia; heart disease; visceral fat accumulation and all its attendant health consequences; the process of glycation via amylopectin A of wheat that leads to cataracts, diabetes, and arthritis; among others. There are, in fact, a wealth of studies documenting the adverse, often crippling, effects of wheat consumption in humans.

The other claim is that wheat elimination ‘means missing out on a wealth of essential nutrients. Another falsity. Dr. Davis states that if you replace wheat with healthy foods like vegetables, nuts, healthy oils, meats, eggs, cheese, avocados, and olives, then there is no nutrient deficiency that develops with elimination of wheat. Dr Davis also states that people with celiac disease may require long-term supplementation due to extensive gastrointenstinal damage caused by wheat.

People with celiac disease do indeed experience deficiencies of multiple vitamins and minerals after they eliminate all wheat and gluten from the diet. But this is not due to a diet lacking valuable nutrients, but from the incomplete healing of the gastrointestinal tract (such as the lining of the duodenum and proximal jejunum). In these people, the destructive effects of wheat are so overpowering that, unfortunately, some people never heal completely. These people do indeed require vitamin and mineral supplementation, as well as probiotics and pancreatic enzyme supplementation.

Due to the unique properties of amylopectin A, two slices of whole wheat bread increase blood sugar higher than many candy bars. High blood glucose leads to the process of glycation that, in turn, causes arthritis (cartilage glycation), cataracts (lens protein glycation), diabetes (glycotoxicity of pancreatic beta cells), hepatic de novo lipogenesis that increases triglycerides and, thereby, increases expression of atherogenic (heart disease-causing) small LDL particles, leading to heart attacks. Repetitive high blood sugars that develop from a grain-rich diet are, in my view, very destructive and lead to weight gain (specifically visceral fat), insulin resistance, leptin resistance (leading to obesity), and many of the health struggles that many now experience.

Andrew L. Rubman, ND, is medical director, Southbury Clinic for Traditional Medicines, Southbury, Connecticut, said wheat consumption (specifically gluten found in wheat, rye and barley) could play a role in turning the genetic diabetes switch to “on” for those who carry the risk gene. Dr. Rubman says that gluten avoidance might prove useful for people who already havediabetes because it may reduce the impact of the disease. He suggests to try a gluten-free diet for four to six months to see if symptom severity and blood sugar control improve. If the answer is yes, Dr. Rubman advises staying gluten-free for life.

Wheat gliadin has been associated with cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, gluten encephalopathy (dementia), behavioral outbursts in children with ADHD and autism, and paranoid delusions and auditory hallucinations in people with schizophrenia, severe and incapacitating effects for people suffering from these conditions.

According to statistics from the University of Chicago Celiac Disease Center, an average of one out of every 133 otherwise healthy people in the United States suffers from CD. However, an estimated 20-30 percent of the world’s population may carry the genetic susceptibility to celiac disease–and the way to avoid turning these genes ‘on’ is by avoiding gluten.

When you consider that undiagnosed CD is associated with a nearly four-fold increased risk of premature death, the seriousness of this food sensitivity becomes quite evident. The primary disease mechanism at play is chronic inflammation, and chronic inflammatory and degenerative conditions are endemic to grain-consuming populations.

Changes in genetic code and, thereby, antigenic profile, of the high-yield semi-dwarf wheat cultivars now on the market account for the marked increase in celiac potential nationwide. “Hybridization” techniques, including chemical mutagenesis to induce selective mutations, leads to development of unique strains that are not subject to animal or human safety testing–they are just brought to market and sold.

Author and preventive cardiologist William Davis, MD, wheat’s new biochemical code causes hormone disruption that is linked to diabetes and obesity. “It is not my contention that it is in everyone’s best interest to cut back on wheat; it is my belief that complete elimination is in everyone’s best health interests,” says Dr. Davis, “In my view, that’s how bad this thing called ‘wheat’ has become.”

Chemical mutagenesis using the toxic mutagen, sodium azide, of course, is the method used to generate BASF’s Clearfield herbicide-resistant wheat strain. These methods are being used on a wide scale to generate unique genetic strains that are, without question from the FDA or USDA, assumed to be safe for human consumption.

* Note that many of the wheat-free options still contain gluten.

1. Cereal Grains: Barley, millet, oats, rice, rye, sorghum, tef and wild rice are all in the same cereal grain family as is wheat. All flours ground from cereal grains may be used as a wheat substitute. Commonly available are barley, buckwheat, rice and rye flour. The less utilized flours may be purchased online or from natural food stores. Note: people with a gluten allergy must also avoid barley, oats and rye.

2. Non-Cereal Grains: Amaranth, quinoa and buckwheat are three grain-like seeds unrelated to cereal grains. (Despite its name, buckwheat is not a wheat-relative.) It is rare for anyone to develop a sensitivity to these non-cereal grains. Amaranth, quinoa and buckwheat are gluten-free and therefore not suitable for making leavened bread; however, they make excellent quick breads and cookies.

3. Nut Meal: Ground nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts or walnuts make the richest flour substitute for cookies and cakes. Because their fragile fatty acid content gives them a brief shelf life, it’s preferable to grind your own nuts in a food processor just prior to use. Nut meal requires a binding agent such as eggs. Because chestnuts are lower in fat than other nuts, chestnut flour has a longer shelf life. It is available online.

4. Bean Flour: Dried beans, such as navy, pinto and chickpeas may be milled and used, in combination with other flours, as a wheat alternative. Bean flour is, however, not always recommended. It tastes like beans and makes baked goods dense and hard to digest.

5. Other Flour Substitutes: Potato starch, arrowroot powder, and tapioca are thickening agents that substitute for wheat in sauces and gravy. In baked goods these starchy ingredients serve as a binding agent.

Due to the irresponsible high frequency hybridization, processing and inevitable genetic modification of modern wheat, there is only one solution for the health and wellness of future generations. Stop eating wheat and educate as many people as you can on the coming strains of this grain which will be much more deadly than they already are today.

889,"The question of if Bigfoot exists has graduated from mysterious footprints and fuzzy images to the forensics of DNA research.

News reports last week suggesting that Bigfoot DNA evidence had been analyzed and confirmed through the peer-reviewed DeNovo Scientific Journal raised questions over the legitimacy of the publication.

Questions were also raised — and have still not been fully answered — about Texas veterinarian Melba Ketchum’s involvement with the journal, threatening the credibility of her five-year study of various alleged Bigfoot DNA samples.

Ketchum’s Sasquatch Genome Project site has released the following short video, reportedly showing a sleeping Bigfoot in Kentucky in 2005:

The video above certainly raises many questions about the circumstances surrounding an alleged sleeping Sasquatch.

How did the videographer get so close to the creature without disturbing it?

What was the outcome of this event?

Did the Sasquatch just get up and run away, or turn to attack the cameraman?

Why has it taken eight years for this to be shown?

Why can’t the public see the rest of the footage?

Ketchum has felt that the scientific community tried to prevent her work from seeing the light of day.

“We encountered the worst scientific bias in the peer review process in recent history,” Ketchum wrote on her Sasquatch Genome Project site.

“Several journals wouldn’t even read our manuscript when we sent them a pre-submission inquiry. We were even mocked by one reviewer in his peer review. We did finally pass peer review with a relatively new journal,” she wrote.

Over the past week, some have alleged that Ketchum somehow “purchased” a little-known journal in order to re-register it under a new name — DeNovo Scientific Journal — and then publish her own results of over 111 samples of reported Bigfoot hair, blood, toenail, saliva and skin.

“I’m certainly not ruling out the possibility that there was a conspiracy of sorts, or a concerted effort to not give this a fair shake, given the controversial matter,” said Idaho State University anthropologist Jeff Meldrum, a leading academic and recognized scientific authority on Bigfoot.

“To make an end-run around the process by erecting a facade in the form of a so-called new journal and allege that it is edited and reviewed, without providing any of that information on the public web page, it appears that she has undertaken an effort to self-publish, just to get it out there,” Meldrum told The Huffington Post. “And, to boot, she’s charging $30 a pop for a copy of the paper.”

Meldrum said he doesn’t think any credible scientific journal would shy away from the topic simply because of its controversial nature.

“I wouldn’t rule it out entirely. There are certainly politics involved in the selection of papers. If it’s solid work, this is the discovery of the century, if not the millennium,” Meldrum said.

“Any journal, if they were confident in the results and in the expertise of their reviewers, and it came down positive — I would think they would clamor for the opportunity to have that on the front cover of their journal.”

While this drama was played out in the media, other related Bigfoot DNA stories quietly emerged.

In Colorado, a group of researchers that contributed possible Bigfoot samples to Ketchum’s study claim to have evidence that could prove Bigfoot’s existence.

Dave Paulides, of North America Bigfoot Search, told CBS 4 Denver affiliate that his group has collected hundreds of reported Bigfoot DNA samples.

“This DNA is like nothing else in the world,” Paulides said about strands of hair from a reported Sasquatch in Northern California. “This isn’t an animal. This is a subspecies of a human, and we believe they travel in groups.",conspiracy,C02ba7,big.foot

As covered in Part 1 of this trilogy of articles, after years of questioning and research, I just attended my first UFO confab, the 31st Annual 2018 Ozark Mountain UFO Conference in Eureka Springs, Arkansas from April 12-14.

After Richard Dolan shared his views about “UFOs and the Media: Disinformation or Disclosure?” the second presenter, astronomer Marc D’Antonio talked about “Exoplanets and Alien Life: What We Know…” which was a very down-to-earth – so to speak – explanation of how space scientists use wavelengths of light to classify other planets.

The tie-in to ufology is where visiting ETs (extraterrestrials) might hail from. Since we know that all suns are born and eventually die, wiping out planets in their systems, D’Antonio posed the interesting theory that ETs are here because their home planets were destroyed.

It is worth mentioning that D’Antonio began his presentation by wondering if owls, which are often associated with UFO sighting and abduction cases, are screen images of gray aliens? Many abductees report remembering false images after missing time, only to find out later that the ETs had imprinted the other image (owl) to mask or screen the abductee’s shocking experience.

But D’Antonio’s exciting news regarded his roving Humvee with telescopes mounted to it which can see ultraviolet to infrared (long to short wavelengths), beyond the light spectrum visible to humans. Now the search for ET can go just about anywhere and record remote images of what is going on in the sky. For astronomers, this is exciting stuff.

D’Antonio finished with a Big Bang by unwinding a spool of “toilet paper” around the audience to illustrate how most of life on earth has appeared over lengthy time periods – except us humans, which have been around Earth for a tiny sliver of the last sheet on the oversized paper roll:

Next up was my personal journalistic hero and editor of Earthfiles, ace reporter, author, and television producer, the award-winning Linda Moulton Howe who led us on a ufological tour-de-force titled “Military Whistleblower Revelations about UFOs and an Alien Presence.” Howe broke the story on bloodless cattle mutilations in the late 1980s and has been an avid researcher on All Things UFO since then. She told us this was her 30th appearance in Eureka Springs – out of 31 total conferences!

Here are the highlights of her fascinating narrative:

– UFOs have been kept secret since British Prime Minister Winston Churchill told US President Harry Truman it had to be that way or civilization would crumble. UFOs posed an existential threat to humanity – they could wipe us out if they so chose – so why panic the public?

– The big news from Antarctica is that the US military has, for the past 15 years, been removing 13-33 million-year-old artifacts found one and a half miles below the ice. The site is accessible only by submarine, and recent visits from world leaders have something to do with the alien culture which originated these objects – whatever they are. The US government wants to “sanitize this physical evidence before presenting it to the public.”

– The US military now has the ability to monitor human brain patterns from satellite platforms. Howe said one of her CIA sources told her, “Your every breath is being tracked by the Men in Black.”

– A Japanese test of AI (artificial intelligence) robots using thought energy as a weapon went horribly wrong when 29 people were killed before all four robots could be deactivated. Researchers disabled two of the robots, but the third began to repair them. The fourth robot reconnected itself to an orbiting satellite to repair itself. This is bad news, and Howe quoted genius inventor and CEO of Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) Elon Musk as saying that humans need to contain AI via legislation and regulation within the next four years or face the possibility that they could become truly autonomous and become another existential threat. Musk said, “AI is a fundamental risk to humankind.”

– Ironically, Musk is developing his own AI medical company, Neuralink, to develop bionic technologies “for human enhancement.” Coincidentally, he predicts that his team will link human thought to AI devices in four years (there’s that number again). Computer-driven biological body part replacement is under rapid development. Soon, we may be able to change out a hand (or a liver) as easily as replacing the wheels or radiator on a car.

– Howe concluded her remarks with a detailed analysis of an alleged briefing held March 6-8, 1981 for newly-elected President Ronald Reagan. Then-CIA Director William Colby and a team of CIA analysts and handlers gave the Commander-in-Chief “need to know” intel about UFOs and ETs. Of the several species known at that time, some were helpful, some neutral, and some adversarial. Reagan was especially interested to know more about the most dangerous of the Hostile Alien Visitors (HAVs), a race called the Trantaloids.

Howe posed two intriguing questions we can all ponder:

2. Would EBENs (ETs) save us if a killer asteroid were threatening life on Earth with an extinction-level event like the one that killed all the dinosaurs? The Visitors have technology advanced enough to destroy such an asteroid – but would they help a poor human out?

The last presenter that first day was the “father of modern ufology,” nuclear scientist Stanton Friedman. This scholarly physicist explained the nuts-and-bolts of actual nuclear fission and fusion research and development projects he participated in – most of which, he laughed, lost funding along the way.

The upside to short-lived projects was that Friedman became involved in a multitude of interesting power and weapons projects – and he had the slides to prove it. Friedman maintains that both black and white operations have produced nuclear technologies capable of space exploration.

In a casual discussion at his book table (absent his books which were in luggage lost in transit – like so many of his projects, as he quipped – and delivered by the airline only on the last day of the conference, all of which promptly sold out), Friedman gave this sage piece of advice:

“Check your facts before you publish – because your critics will.”

Day 2 of the 2018 Ozark Mountain UFO Conference began, for me, with an engrossing talk on subjects I know almost nothing about: cryptozoology. Cryptozoologists seek to prove the existence of folkloric entities like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster. Ufologist, History Channel program regular, and best-selling author, British-born <http://nickredfernfortean.blogspot.com/”> Nicholas “Nick” Redfern kept us spell-bound with “The Men and Women in Black: Don’t Answer the Door!”

Redfern traced the first report of a Man in Black to Wales in 1909. Residents witnessed strange “balls of light” overhead – UFOs. Oddly enough, after the incident, a man dressed completely in black with a distinctive, brimmed hat drove a horse-and-carriage into town. The mysterious figure went from house to house, warning the occupants to keep quiet about what they had seen.

Over the years, stories have circulated about people (both men and women) dressed in black, with black hair and often piercing black eyes showing up on experiencers’ doorsteps – in broad daylight or the middle of the night. They never demand entry. Instead, they ask to be let in, using mind control techniques. This is something you definitely do not want to do: resist the urge to open that door. People who got close to the MIBs felt nauseous, drained of life force, and sometimes felt like their minds were being probed telepathically.

Then, Redfern explored the possibility that Ouija boards open a portal to paranormal realms, particularly unsavory (malefic or downright demonic) ones.

It turns out that Redfern is an expert on Mothman sightings, and he spent quite a bit of time talking about the Slender Man phenomenon. Slender Man was a completely fictional character which won a Most Menacing Monster contest. The tall, faceless man became very popular among horror fans, to the point where some claimed to have experienced encounters with an actual Slender Man. Could enough mass thought/belief actually create a brand-new paranormal enemy – from a potent thought-form?

I certainly had a lot to ponder, with some stellar speakers still to come! Please join me for (with a nod to Paul Harvey) “the rest of the story.”

727,"Jason Statham is an English actor who broke into film with 1998's ‘Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels’ and later starred in high-profile action movie franchises, including ‘The Transporter,’ ‘Crank,’ ‘The Expendables’ and ‘The Fast and the Furious.’

English action star Jason Statham has convincingly portrayed a host of unsavory, yet oddly endearing, tough guys (hit men, thieves, con men, assassins, super spies and bodyguards) who can generally be counted on to dish out beat downs and lead car chases while intercutting the action with a well-timed quip. But before he ever stepped foot on a movie set, Statham’s life was just as colorful as the characters he’s played onscreen. From being an Olympic diver to fashion model to even having a side gig in the black market, Statham amassed a unique set of skills that perfectly positioned him to be an action star.

As of 2019, Statham’s net worth is estimated to be around $50 million.

Statham once worked as a con artist, selling fake perfume and stolen jewelry on the streets.

""That was street theater,"" Statham said in a 2007 interview with the Chicago Tribune. ""You work with a team — some people in the crowd, some guys who stand lookout for the police.""

And that’s how he met filmmaker Guy Ritchie, who was fascinated by Statham's past. Ritchie invited him to audition for a part in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. ""Guy had written a character that was the same as me,” Statham said in an interview with Esquire magazine. “And he said, 'I love it. Give me some of the patter.' At the time, I had loads of it. And he was fascinated with that, and he just wanted someone who was authentic.”

So even though Statham had no acting experience or training, Richie cast him as Bacon, a central character who was attempting to make easy money to repay a huge gambling debt.

In his next crime comedy, Snatch (2000), Richie brought Statham on again, this time as a petty criminal named Turkish who tries to make a name for himself in underground boxing. Although the role was originally a minor one — with headline-name actors including Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro, front and center — Statham's role evolved substantially, and he became an unforgettable anti-hero.

'The Transporter,' 'Crank,' 'The Mechanic,' & 'The Expendables'

Luc Besson then cast Statham in the titular role of 2002’s The Transporter, about a driver-for-hire— willing to deliver anything as long as the price is right — until he gets involved in the kidnapping of a young woman who has ties to a dangerous drug ring. The film was a huge hit, which established Statham as an action hero and spawned a sequel in 2005. Statham has also starred in the films Crank and its sequel, as well as The Mechanic and its 2016 sequel. In 2010 he joined the Sylvester Stallone and an all-star cast for The Expendables, The Expendables 2 (2012) and The Expendables 3 (2014).

'The Fast and the Furious' Franchise and 'Hobbs & Shaw'

In 2013 Statham joined an already established action franchise, The Fast and the Furious 6 and in 2017, reprised his role in its eighth installment, The Fate of the Furious. He later paired with his erstwhile screen nemesis Dwayne Johnson for the launch of the spinoff Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw in 2019.

In the 2015 comedy ‘Spy,’ written and directed by Paul Feig, and starring Melissa McCarthy, Jude Law and Rose Byrne, Statham stands out as an anti-James Bond. Though Feig wrote the part of surly agent Rick Ford with Statham in mind, he told Forbes.com he never thought he would accept the role. Staham concedes that he had some hesitation about it. “You never know what you’re getting into with a comedy,” Statham said in an interview with Variety. “But it helps to have a great director and Paul Feig is the Scorsese of comedy films.” Statham is set to reprise his role in the upcoming sequel, Spy 2.

In August 2018, Statham was back in theaters as the star of the sci-fi horror film The Meg, about a 75-foot prehistoric shark that terrorizes a submarine crew. Expected to flop, the film instead proved a surprising hit, taking in $44.5 million at the North American box office and another $97 million overseas during its opening weekend.

Since 1998 Statham has made more than 40 films, almost all of them in the action genre. Yet unlike many action stars, Statham is known for performing the vast majority his stunts. He has also advocated for having stunt performers be included at the Oscars with a designated category.

Jason Statham was born on July 26, 1967 in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, to Eileen and Barry Statham. He had an older brother named Lee and both took interest in martial arts. But Jason had other athletic passions, one of which was diving, and he began working on those skills, eventually becoming a part of the British Olympic Team that traveled to Seoul, Korea in 1988. After the Olympics, he continued as a member of the National Diving Squad for the next decade. However, after some disappointing finishes at the World Championships and Olympic trials, he decided to focus on the next chapter of his career.

A few years later, his athletic build caught the eye of a talent agent and landed Statham a gig in an ad campaign for the European clothing retailer French Connection. An appearance in a Levi's Jeans commercial and work for Hilfiger followed and soon Statham had a modeling career. This helped him land jobs as a background dancer in early '90s music videos like The Shamen's ""Comin' On"" and Erasure's ""Run to the Sun.""

Statham and supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley began dating in 2011, and together, had a son, Jack Oscar, in 2017. The couple got engaged in 2016.",mainstream,M08547,big.foot

Indeed, it is this disturbing conclusion—perhaps even more than the idea of a Republican dirty trick—that may explain the longstanding and determined cover-up of this political scandal.

Too many powerful interests do not want the American people to accept even the possibility that U.S. intelligence operatives and a longtime ally could intervene to oust a president who had impinged on what those two groups considered their vital interests.

To accept that scenario would mean that two of the great fears of American democracy had come true—George Washington’s warning against the dangers of “entangling alliances” and Harry Truman’s concern that the clandestine operations of the CIA had the makings of an “American Gestapo.”

It is far easier to assure the American people that no such thing could occur, that Israel’s Likud—whatever its differences with Washington over Middle East peace policies—would never seek to subvert a U.S. president, and that CIA dissidents—no matter how frustrated by political constraints—would never sabotage their own government.

But the evidence points in that direction, and there are some points that are not in dispute. For instance, there is no doubt that CIA Old Boys and Likudniks had strong motives for seeking President Jimmy Carter’s defeat in 1980.

Inside the CIA, Carter and his CIA Director Stansfield Turner were blamed for firing many of the free-wheeling covert operatives from the Vietnam era, for ousting legendary spymaster Ted Shackley, and for failing to protect longtime U.S. allies (and friends of the CIA), such as Iran’s Shah and Nicaragua’s dictator Anastasio Somoza.

As for Israel, Likud Prime Minister Menachem Begin was furious over Carter’s high-handed actions at Camp David in 1978 forcing Israel to trade the occupied Sinai to Egypt for a peace deal. Begin feared that Carter would use his second term to bully Israel into accepting a Palestinian state on West Bank lands that Likud considered part of Israel’s divinely granted territory.

Former Mossad and Foreign Ministry official David Kimche described Begin’s attitude in his 1991 book, The Last Option, saying that Israeli officials had gotten wind of “collusion” between Carter and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat “to force Israel to abandon her refusal to withdraw from territories occupied in 1967, including Jerusalem, and to agree to the establishment of a Palestinian state.”

Kimche continued, “This plan — prepared behind Israel’s back and without her knowledge — must rank as a unique attempt in United States’s diplomatic history of short-changing a friend and ally by deceit and manipulation.”

However, Begin recognized that the scheme required Carter winning a second term in 1980 when, Kimche wrote, “he would be free to compel Israel to accept a settlement of the Palestinian problem on his and Egyptian terms, without having to fear the backlash of the American Jewish lobby.”

In his 1992 memoir, Profits of War, Ari Ben-Menashe, an Israeli military intelligence officer who worked with Likud, agreed that Begin and other Likud leaders held Carter in contempt.

“Begin loathed Carter for the peace agreement forced upon him at Camp David,” Ben-Menashe wrote. “As Begin saw it, the agreement took away Sinai from Israel, did not create a comprehensive peace, and left the Palestinian issue hanging on Israel’s back.”

So, in order to buy time for Israel to “change the facts on the ground” by moving Jewish settlers into the West Bank, Begin felt Carter’s reelection had to be prevented. A different president also presumably would give Israel a freer hand to deal with problems on its northern border with Lebanon.

As for the CIA Old Boys, legendary CIA officer Miles Copeland told me that “the CIA within the CIA” — the inner-most circle of powerful intelligence figures who felt they understood best the strategic needs of the United States — believed Carter and his naïve faith in American democratic ideals represented a grave threat to the nation.

“Carter really believed in all the principles that we talk about in the West,” Copeland said, shaking his mane of white hair. “As smart as Carter is, he did believe in Mom, apple pie and the corner drug store. And those things that are good in America are good everywhere else. …

“Carter, I say, was not a stupid man,” Copeland said, adding that Carter had an even worse flaw: “He was a principled man.”

These attitudes of “the CIA within the CIA” and the Likudniks appear to stem from their genuine beliefs that they needed to protect what they regarded as vital interests of their respective countries. The CIA Old Boys thought they understood the true strategic needs of the United States and Likud believed fervently in a “Greater Israel.”

However, the lingering October Surprise mystery is whether these two groups followed their strongly held feelings into a treacherous bid, in league with Republicans, to prevent Carter from gaining the release of 52 hostages then held in Iran and thus torpedoing his reelection hopes.

Carter’s inability to resolve that hostage crisis did set the stage for Ronald Reagan’s landslide victory in November 1980 as American voters reacted to the long-running hostage humiliation by turning to a candidate they believed would be a tougher player on the international stage.

Reagan’s macho image was reinforced when the Iranians released the hostages immediately after he was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 1981, ending the 444-day standoff.

The coincidence of timing, which Reagan’s supporters cited as proof that foreign enemies feared the new president, gave momentum to Reagan’s larger agenda, including sweeping tax cuts tilted toward the wealthy, reduced government regulation of corporations, and renewed reliance on fossil fuels. (Carter’s solar panels were pointedly dismantled from the White House roof.)

Reagan’s victory also was great news for CIA cold-warriors who were rewarded with the choice of World War II spymaster (and dedicated cold-warrior) William Casey to be CIA director. Casey then purged CIA analysts who were detecting a declining Soviet Union that desired détente and replaced them with people like the young and ambitious Robert Gates, who agreed that the Soviets were on the march and that the United States needed a massive military expansion to counter them.

Further, Casey again embraced old-time CIA swashbuckling in Third World countries and took pleasure in misleading or bullying members of Congress when they insisted on the CIA oversight that had been forced on President Gerald Ford and had been accepted by President Carter. To Casey, CIA oversight became a game of hide and seek.

As for Israel, Begin was pleased to find the Reagan administration far less demanding about peace deals with the Arabs, giving Israel time to expand its West Bank settlements. Reagan and his team also acquiesced to Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982, a drive north that expelled the Palestine Liberation Organization but also led to the slaughters at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps.

And, behind the scenes, Reagan gave a green light to Israeli weapons shipments to Iran (which was fighting a war with Israel’s greater enemy, Iraq). The weapons sales helped Israel rebuild its contacts inside Iran and to turn large profits, which were then used to help finance West Bank settlements.

In another important move, Reagan credentialed a new generation of pro-Israeli American ideologues known as the neoconservatives, a move that would pay big dividends for Israel in the future as these bright and articulate operatives fought for Israeli interests both inside the U.S. government and through their opinion-leading roles in the major American news media.

In other words, if the disgruntled CIA Old Boys and the determined Likudniks did participate in an October Surprise scheme to unseat Jimmy Carter, they surely got much of what they were after.

Yet, while motive is an important element in solving a mystery, it does not constitute proof by itself. What must be examined is whether there is evidence that the motive was acted upon, whether Menachem Begin’s government and disgruntled CIA officers covertly assisted the Reagan-Bush campaign in contacting Iranian officials to thwart Carter’s hostage negotiations.

On that point the evidence is strong though perhaps not ironclad. Still, a well-supported narrative does exist describing how the October Surprise scheme may have gone down with the help of CIA personnel, Begin’s government, some right-wing intelligence figures in Europe, and a handful of other power brokers in the United States.

Even before Iran took the American hostages on Nov. 4, 1979, disgruntled CIA veterans had been lining up behind the presidential candidacy of their former boss, George H.W. Bush. Casting off their traditional cloak of non-partisanship and anonymity, they were volunteering as foot soldiers in Bush’s campaign.

One joke about Bush’s announcement of his candidacy on May 1, 1979, was that “half the audience was wearing raincoats.”

Bill Colby, Bush’s predecessor as CIA director, said Bush “had a flood of people from the CIA who joined his supporters. They were retirees devoted to him for what he had done” in defending the spy agency in 1976 when the CIA came under heavy criticism for spying on Americans, assassination plots and other abuses.

Reagan’s foreign policy adviser Richard Allen described the group working on the Bush campaign as a “plane load of disgruntled former CIA” officers who were “playing cops and robbers.”

All told, at least two dozen former CIA officials went to work for Bush. Among them was the CIA’s director of security, Robert Gambino, who joined the Bush campaign immediately after leaving the CIA where he oversaw security investigations of senior Carter officials and thus knew about potentially damaging personal information.

Besides the ex-CIA personnel who joined the Bush campaign, other pro-Bush intelligence officers remained inside the CIA while making clear their political preference. “The seventh floor of Langley was plastered with ‘Bush for President’ signs,” said senior CIA analyst George Carver, referring to the floor that housed senior CIA officials.

Carter administration officials also grew concerned about the deep personal ties between the former CIA officers in Bush’s campaign and active-duty CIA personnel who continued to hold sensitive jobs under Carter.

For instance, Gambino, the 25-year CIA veteran who oversaw personnel security checks, and CIA officer Donald Gregg, who served as a CIA representative on Carter’s National Security Council, “are good friends who knew each other from the CIA,” according to an unpublished part of a report by a House task force that investigated the October Surprise issue in 1992. [I found this deleted section — still marked “secret” — in unpublished task force files in 1994.]

Perhaps most significantly, Bush quietly enlisted Theodore Shackley, the legendary CIA covert operations specialist known as the “blond ghost.” During the Cold War, Shackley had run many of the CIA’s most controversial paramilitary operations, from Vietnam and Laos to the JMWAVE operations against Fidel Castro’s Cuba.

In those operations, Shackley had supervised the work of hundreds of CIA officers and developed powerful bonds of loyalty with many of his subordinates. For instance, Donald Gregg had served under Shackley’s command in Vietnam.

When Bush was CIA director in 1976, he appointed Shackley to a top clandestine job, associate deputy director for operations, laying the foundation for Shackley’s possible rise to director and cementing Shackley’s loyalty to Bush. When Shackley had a falling out with Carter’s CIA Director Turner in 1979, Shackley quit the agency.

Privately, Shackley believed that Turner had devastated the agency by pushing out hundreds of covert officers, many of them Shackley’s former subordinates.

By early 1980, the Republicans also were complaining that they were being kept in the dark about progress on the Iran hostage negotiations. George Cave, then a top CIA specialist on Iran, told me that the “Democrats never briefed the Republicans” on sensitive developments, creating suspicions among the Republicans.

So, the Republicans sought out their own sources of information regarding the hostage crisis. Shackley began monitoring Carter’s progress on negotiations through his contacts with Iranians in Europe, Cave said.

“Ted, I know, had a couple of contacts in Germany,” said Cave. “I know he talked to them. I don’t know how far it went. … Ted was very active on that thing in the winter/spring of 1980.”

Author David Corn also got wind of the Shackley-Bush connection when he was researching his biography of Shackley, Blond Ghost.

“Within the spook world the belief spread that Shackley was close to Bush,” Corn wrote. “Rafael Quintero [an anti-Castro Cuban with close ties to the CIA] was saying that Shackley met with Bush every week. He told one associate that should Reagan and Bush triumph, Shackley was considered a potential DCI,” the abbreviation for CIA director.

Some of the legendary CIA officers from an even earlier generation, those who had helped overthrow Iran’s elected government in 1953 and put the Shah on the Peacock Throne, also injected themselves into the hostage crisis.

Miles Copeland, one of the agency’s old Middle East hands, claimed in his memoir, The Game Player, that he and his CIA chums pondered their own hostage rescue plan while organizing an informal support group for the Bush campaign, called “Spooks for Bush.”

In a 1990 interview, Copeland told me that “the way we saw Washington at that time was that the struggle was really not between the Left and the Right, the liberals and the conservatives, as between the Utopians and the realists, the pragmatists.

“Carter was a Utopian. He believed, honestly, that you must do the right thing and take your chance on the consequences. He told me that. He literally believed that.” Copeland’s deep Southern accent spit out the words with a mixture of amazement and disgust.

Copeland’s contacts at the time included CIA veteran Archibald Roosevelt and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger — both of whom were close to David Rockefeller whose Chase Manhattan Bank handled billions of dollars in the Shah’s accounts, a fortune that the Iranian mullahs wanted to lay their hands on.

“There were many of us — myself along with Henry Kissinger, David Rockefeller, Archie Roosevelt in the CIA at the time — we believed very strongly that we were showing a kind of weakness, which people in Iran and elsewhere in the world hold in great contempt,” Copeland said.

As Copeland and his friends contemplated what to do regarding the hostage crisis, he reached out to other of his old CIA buddies.

According to The Game Player, Copeland turned to ex-CIA counter-intelligence chief James Angleton. The famed spy hunter “brought to lunch a Mossad chap who confided that his service had identified at least half of the ‘students,’ even to the extent of having their home addresses in Tehran,” Copeland wrote. “He gave me a rundown on what sort of kids they were. Most of them, he said, were just that, kids.”

One of the young Israeli intelligence agents assigned to the task of figuring out who was who in the new Iranian power structure was Ari Ben-Menashe, who was born in Iran but emigrated to Israel as a teen-ager. Not only did he speak fluent Farsi, but he had school friends who were rising within the new revolutionary bureaucracy.

In his memoir, Profits of War, Ben-Menashe offered his own depiction of Copeland’s initiative. Though Copeland was generally regarded as a CIA “Arabist” who had opposed Israeli interests in the past, he was admired for his analytical skills, Ben-Menashe wrote.

“A meeting between Miles Copeland and Israeli intelligence officers was held at a Georgetown house in Washington, D.C.,” Ben-Menashe wrote. “The Israelis were happy to deal with any initiative but Carter’s.

“David Kimche, chief of Tevel, the foreign relations unit of Mossad, was the senior Israeli at the meeting. … The Israelis and the Copeland group came up with a two-pronged plan to use quiet diplomacy with the Iranians and to draw up a scheme for military action against Iran that would not jeopardize the lives of the hostages.”

In late February 1980, Seyeed Mehdi Kashani, an Iranian emissary, arrived in Israel to discuss Iran’s growing desperation for spare parts for its U.S.-supplied air force, Ben-Menashe wrote.

Kashani, whom Ben-Menashe had known from their school days in Tehran, also revealed that the Copeland initiative was making inroads inside Iran and that approaches from some Republican emissaries had already been received, Ben-Menashe wrote.

“Kashani said that the secret ex-CIA-Miles-Copeland group was aware that any deal cut with the Iranians would have to include the Israelis because they would have to be used as a third party to sell military equipment to Iran,” according to Ben-Menashe.

In March 1980, the following month, the Israelis made their first direct military shipment to Iran, 300 tires for Iran’s F-4 fighter jets, Ben-Menashe wrote.

Ben-Menashe’s account of these early Israeli arms shipments was corroborated by Carter’s press secretary Jody Powell and Israeli arms dealer William Northrop.

In an interview for a 1991 PBS “Frontline” documentary, Jody Powell told me that “there had been a rather tense discussion between President Carter and Prime Minister Begin in the spring of 1980 in which the President made clear that the Israelis had to stop that [arms dealing], and that we knew that they were doing it, and that we would not allow it to continue, at least not allow it to continue privately and without the knowledge of the American people.”

“And it stopped,” Powell said. At least, it stopped temporarily.

Meanwhile, Carter also was learning that Begin was siding with the Republicans.

Questioned by congressional investigators in 1992, Carter said he realized by April 1980 that “Israel cast their lot with Reagan,” according to notes I found among the unpublished documents in the files of a House task force that had looked into the October Surprise case.

Carter traced the Israeli opposition to his reelection to a “lingering concern [among] Jewish leaders that I was too friendly with Arabs.”

The President also may have had political enemies close to his inner circle.

Jamshid Hashemi, an Iranian businessman who was recruited by the CIA in January 1980 along with his brother Cyrus, said that in spring 1980, he encountered Donald Gregg, the CIA officer serving on Carter’s National Security Council staff, at Cyrus’s Manhattan office.

Jamshid Hashemi said his brother Cyrus was playing a double game, officially helping the Carter administration on the hostage crisis but privately collaborating with the Republicans. [For details, see Robert Parry’s Secrecy & Privilege.]

The alleged involvement of Gregg is another highly controversial part of the October Surprise mystery. A tall man with an easy-going manner, Gregg had known George H.W. Bush since 1967 when Bush was a first-term U.S. congressman.

Gregg also briefed Bush when he was U.S. envoy to China. Gregg served, too, as the CIA’s liaison to the Pike Committee investigation when Bush was CIA director.

“Although Gregg was uniformly regarded as a competent professional, there was a dimension to his background that was entirely unknown to his colleagues at the White House, and that was his acquaintance with one of the Republican frontrunners, George Bush,” former Carter NSC official Gary Sick wrote in his book October Surprise.

As the Iran crisis dragged on, Copeland and his group of CIA Old Boys forwarded their own plan for freeing the hostages. However, to Copeland’s chagrin, his plan fell on deaf ears inside the Carter administration, which was developing its own rescue operation.

So, Copeland told me that he distributed his plan outside the administration, to leading Republicans, giving sharper focus to their contempt for Carter’s bungled Iranian strategy.

“Officially, the plan went only to people in the government and was top secret and all that,” Copeland said. “But as so often happens in government, one wants support, and when it was not being handled by the Carter administration as though it was top secret, it was handled as though it was nothing. … Yes, I sent copies to everybody who I thought would be a good ally. …

“Now I’m not at liberty to say what reaction, if any, ex-President [Richard] Nixon took, but he certainly had a copy of this. We sent one to Henry Kissinger. … So we had these informal relationships where the little closed circle of people who were, a, looking forward to a Republican President within a short while and, b, who were absolutely trustworthy and who understood all these inner workings of the international game board.”

Encircled by a growing legion of enemies, the Carter administration put the finishing touches on its hostage-rescue operation in April. Code-named “Eagle Claw,” the assault involved a force of U.S. helicopters that would swoop down on Tehran, coordinate with some agents on the ground and extract the hostages.

Carter ordered the operation to proceed on April 24, but mechanical problems forced the helicopters to turn back. At a staging area called Desert One, one of the helicopters collided with a refueling plane, causing an explosion that killed eight American crewmen.

Their charred bodies were then displayed by the Iranian government, adding to the fury and humiliation of the United States. After the Desert One fiasco, the Iranians dispersed the hostages to a variety of locations, effectively shutting the door on another rescue attempt.

By summer 1980, Copeland told me, the Republicans in his circle considered a second hostage-rescue attempt not only unfeasible, but unnecessary. They were talking confidently about the hostages being freed after a Republican victory in November, the old CIA man said.

“Nixon, like everybody else, knew that all we had to do was wait until the election came, and they were going to get out,” Copeland said. “That was sort of an open secret among people in the intelligence community, that that would happen. … The intelligence community certainly had some understanding with somebody in Iran in authority, in a way that they would hardly confide in me.”

Copeland said his CIA friends had been told by contacts in Iran that the mullahs would do nothing to help Carter or his reelection.

“At that time, we had word back, because you always have informed relations with the devil,” Copeland said. “But we had word that, ‘Don’t worry.’ As long as Carter wouldn’t get credit for getting these people out, as soon as Reagan came in, the Iranians would be happy enough to wash their hands of this and move into a new era of Iranian-American relations, whatever that turned out to be.”

In the interview, Copeland declined to give more details, beyond his assurance that “the CIA within the CIA,” his term for the true protectors of U.S. national security, had an understanding with the Iranians about the hostages. (Copeland died on Jan. 14, 1991.)

In summer 1980, Ronald Reagan wrapped up the Republican nomination and offered the vice presidential slot to his former rival, George H.W. Bush. As Bush’s team merged with Reagan’s campaign, so too did Bush’s contingent of CIA veterans.

Reagan’s campaign director William Casey — a spymaster for the World War II-era Office of Strategic Services — also blended in well with the ex-intelligence officers.

Many of the October Surprise allegations have Casey and his longtime business associate John Shaheen, another OSS veteran, meeting with Iranians and other foreigners overseas.

Casey also had secret meetings with Kissinger, according to Casey’s chauffeur, and with banker David Rockefeller and ex-CIA officer Archibald Roosevelt, who had gone to work for Rockefeller, according to the Sept. 11, 1980, visitor log at the Reagan-Bush headquarters in Arlington, Virginia.

On Sept. 16, 1980, five days after the Rockefeller group’s visit to Casey’s office, Iran’s acting foreign minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh spoke publicly about Republican interference.

“Reagan, supported by Kissinger and others, has no intention of resolving the problem” with the hostages, Ghotbzadeh said. “They will do everything in their power to block it.”

Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr held a similar opinion from his position in Tehran. In a 1992 letter to the House task force on the October Surprise case, Bani-Sadr wrote that he learned of the Republican back-channel initiative in summer 1980 and received a message from an emissary of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini: The Reagan campaign was in league with pro-Republican elements of the CIA in an effort to undermine Carter and wanted Iran’s help.

Bani-Sadr said the emissary “told me that if I do not accept this proposal they [the Republicans] would make the same offer to my rivals.”

The emissary added that the Republicans “have enormous influence in the CIA,” Bani-Sadr wrote. “Lastly, he told me my refusal of their offer would result in my elimination.”

Bani-Sadr said he resisted the GOP scheme, but the plan ultimately was accepted by Ayatollah Khomeini, who appeared to have made up his mind around the time of Iraq’s invasion of Iran in mid-September 1980.

However, still sensing a political danger if Carter got the Iranians to change their minds, the Republicans opened the final full month of the campaign by trying to make Carter’s hostage talks look like a cynical ploy to influence the election’s outcome.

On Oct. 2, Republican vice-presidential candidate Bush brought up the issue with a group of reporters: “One thing that’s at the back of everybody’s mind is, ‘What can Carter do that is so sensational and so flamboyant, if you will, on his side to pull off an October Surprise?’ And everybody kind of speculates about it, but there’s not a darn thing we can do about it, nor is there any strategy we can do except possibly have it discounted.”

One congressional investigator who was involved in the Iran-Contra and the October Surprise inquiries told me recently that his conclusion was that the Republicans were pursuing every avenue possible to reach the Iranian leadership to make sure Carter’s hostage negotiations failed.

Former Israeli intelligence officer Ben-Menashe, in his book and in sworn testimony, said the ultimately successful channel was one involving both former and current CIA officers, working with French intelligence for the security of a final meeting in Paris and with Israelis who were given the task of delivering the payoff in weapons shipments and money to Iran.

The key meeting allegedly occurred on the weekend of Oct. 18-19, 1980, between high-level representatives of the Republican team and the Iranians. Ben-Menashe said he was part of a six-member Israeli support delegation for the meeting at the Ritz Hotel in Paris.

In his memoir, Ben-Menashe said he recognized several Americans, including Republican congressional aide Robert McFarlane and CIA officers Robert Gates (who had served on Carter’s NSC staff and was then CIA Director Turner’s executive assistant), Donald Gregg (another CIA designee to Carter’s NSC) and George Cave (the agency’s Iran expert).

Ben-Menashe said Iranian cleric Mehdi Karrubi, then a top foreign policy aide to Ayatollah Khomeini, arrived and walked into a conference room.

“A few minutes later George Bush, with the wispy-haired William Casey in front of him, stepped out of the elevator. He smiled, said hello to everyone, and, like Karrubi, hurried into the conference room,” Ben-Menashe wrote.

Ben-Menashe said the Paris meetings served to finalize a previously outlined agreement calling for release of the 52 hostages in exchange for $52 million, guarantees of arms sales for Iran, and unfreezing of Iranian monies in U.S. banks. The timing, however, was changed, he said, to coincide with Reagan’s expected Inauguration on Jan. 20, 1981.

Though the alleged participants have denied taking part in such a meeting, the alibis cited by the Americans have proved porous. For instance, Gregg produced a photograph of himself in a bathing suit on a beach with the processing date stamped on the back, “October 1980.”

There have been others reasons to doubt their innocence. An FBI polygrapher working for Iran-Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh’s investigation asked Gregg in 1990, “were you ever involved in a plan to delay the release of the hostages in Iran until after the 1980 Presidential election?” Gregg’s negative answer was deemed deceptive. [See the Final Report of the Independent Counsel for Iran/Contra Matters, Vol. I, 501]

Meanwhile, other evidence has surfaced supporting Ben-Menashe’s testimony.

For instance, Chicago Tribune reporter John Maclean, son of author Norman Maclean who wrote A River Runs Through It, confirmed that he was told by a well-placed Republican source on that weekend in October 1980 that Bush was flying to Paris for a clandestine meeting with a delegation of Iranians about the American hostages.

David Andelman, the biographer for Count Alexandre deMarenches, then head of France’s Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionage (SDECE), testified to the House task force that deMarenches told him that he had helped the Reagan-Bush campaign arrange meetings with Iranians on the hostage issue in summer and fall of 1980, with one meeting in Paris in October.

Andelman said deMarenches insisted that the secret meetings be kept out of his memoir because the story could otherwise damage the reputations of his friends, William Casey and George H.W. Bush.

The allegations of a Paris meeting also received support from several other sources, including pilot Heinrich Rupp, who said he flew Casey from Washington’s National Airport to Paris on a flight that left very late on a rainy night in mid-October 1980.

Rupp said that after arriving at LeBourget airport outside Paris, he saw a man resembling Bush on the tarmac. The night of Oct. 18 indeed was rainy in the Washington area. Also, sign-in sheets at the Reagan-Bush headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, placed Casey within a five-minute drive of National Airport late that evening.

There were other bits and pieces of corroboration about the Paris meetings.

A French arms dealer, Nicholas Ignatiew, told me in 1990 that he had checked with his government contacts and was told that Republicans did meet with Iranians in Paris in mid-October 1980.

A well-connected French investigative reporter Claude Angeli said his sources inside the French secret service confirmed that the service provided “cover” for a meeting between Republicans and Iranians in France on the weekend of October 18-19. German journalist Martin Kilian had received a similar account from a top aide to intelligence chief deMarenches.

As early as 1987, Iran’s ex-President Bani-Sadr had made similar claims about a Paris meeting.

Finally, a classified report from the Russian government regarding what its intelligence files showed about the October Surprise issue stated matter-of-factly that Republicans held a series of meetings with Iranians in Europe, including one in Paris in October 1980.

“William Casey, in 1980, met three times with representatives of the Iranian leadership,” the Russian report said. “The meetings took place in Madrid and Paris.”

At the Paris meeting in October 1980, “R[obert] Gates, at that time a staffer of the National Security Council in the administration of Jimmy Carter, and former CIA Director George Bush also took part,” the report said.

“In Madrid and Paris, the representatives of Ronald Reagan and the Iranian leadership discussed the question of possibly delaying the release of 52 hostages from the staff of the U.S. Embassy in Teheran.”

(The Russian report had been requested by Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana, as part of the 1992 task force investigation of the October Surprise case. It arrived on Jan. 11, 1993, just two days before the task force was to release its own report rejecting the October Surprise suspicions.

Despite the alleged Paris agreement, the Reagan-Bush campaign remained nervous about the possibility that Carter might still arrange a pre-election hostage release.

The Reagan-Bush campaign maintained a 24-hour Operations Center, which monitored press wires and reports, gave daily press briefings and maintained telephone and telefax contact with the candidate’s plane, according to a secret draft report of the House task force, which added:

“Many of the staff members were former CIA employees who had previously worked on the Bush campaign or were otherwise loyal to George Bush.”

Bush and Shackley took personal responsibility for making sure the Republican campaign was not caught off guard.

According to Richard Allen’s handwritten notes for Oct. 27, 1980, Bush called Allen at 2:12 p.m. as Bush was heading off to campaign in Pittsburgh. Bush had gotten an unsettling message from former Texas Gov. John Connally, the ex-Democrat who had switched to the Republican Party during the Nixon administration. Connally said his oil contacts in the Middle East were buzzing with rumors that Carter had achieved the long-elusive breakthrough on the hostages.

Bush ordered Allen to find out what he could about Connally’s tip. Allen was to pass on any new details to two of Bush’s aides. According to the notes, Allen was to relay the information to “Ted Shacklee [sic] via Jennifer.”

In a “secret” 1992 deposition to the House October Surprise task force, Allen said the Jennifer was Jennifer Fitzgerald, Bush’s longtime assistant including during his year as director of the CIA. Allen testified that “Shacklee” was Theodore Shackley, the famous CIA covert operations specialist, the “blond ghost.”

Yet, despite the last-minute GOP worries, Carter failed to get the hostages out. The coincidence that the anniversary of the hostage-taking fell on Election Day 1980 further damaged Carter’s hopes as Americans were forced to relive the humiliations of the previous year.

Reagan romped to victory in a landslide, winning 44 states and bringing with him a Republican Senate. Among the Democrat casualties were key figures in efforts to rein in the powers of the imperial presidency — and of the CIA — including Frank Church of Idaho, Birch Bayh of Indiana and George McGovern of South Dakota.

In retrospect, some of Carter’s negotiators felt they should have been much more attentive to the possibility of Republican sabotage. “Looking back, the Carter administration appears to have been far too trusting and particularly blind to the intrigue swirling around it,” said former NSC official Gary Sick.

As the Inauguration neared, Republicans talked tough, making clear that Ronald Reagan wouldn’t stand for the humiliation that the nation endured under Jimmy Carter. The Reagan-Bush team intimated that Reagan would deal harshly with Iran if it didn’t surrender the hostages.

A joke making the rounds of Washington went: “What’s three feet deep and glows in the dark? Teheran ten minutes after Ronald Reagan becomes President.”

On Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 1981, just as Reagan was beginning his inaugural address, word came from Iran that the hostages were freed. The American people were overjoyed.

Privately, some Reagan insiders laughed about their October Surprise success. For instance, Charles Cogan, a high-ranking CIA officer, told the House task force in 1992 that he attended a 1981 meeting at CIA headquarters between Casey and one of David Rockefeller’s top aides, Joseph V. Reed, who had been appointed to be Ambassador to Morocco.

Cogan testified that Reed joked about having blocked Carter’s hostage release.

 A task force investigator, who spoke with Cogan in a less formal setting, said Reed’s wording was, “We fucked Carter’s October Surprise.”

In the months and the years that followed, many of the key figures in the October Surprise mystery saw their career paths veer steeply upward.

Besides Casey’s appointment to head the CIA, Gregg became Vice President Bush’s national security adviser. Robert McFarlane later became Reagan’s NSC adviser. Though relatively young, Robert Gates vaulted up the CIA’s career ladder, becoming head of the analytical division and then deputy director. (He is now Barack Obama’s Secretary of Defense.)

As for Israel and Iran, the arms network flowed with weapons to Iran and millions of dollars in profits back to Israel, with some of the money going build new settlements in the West Bank. In summer 1981, this hidden Israeli-Iranian pipeline slipped briefly into public view.

On July 18, 1981, an Israeli-chartered planes was shot down after straying over the Soviet Union. In a PBS interview nearly a decade later, Nicholas Veliotes, Reagan’s assistant secretary of state for the Middle East, said he looked into the incident by talking to top administration officials who insisted that the State Department issue misleading guidance to the press.

“It was clear to me after my conversations with people on high that indeed we had agreed that the Israelis could transship to Iran some American-origin military equipment,” Veliotes said.

In checking out the Israeli flight, Veliotes came to believe that the Reagan camp’s dealings with Iran dated back to before the 1980 election.

“It seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the election of 1980, as the Israelis had identified who would become the new players in the national security area in the Reagan administration,” Veliotes said. “And I understand some contacts were made at that time.”

In the mid-1980s, many of the same October Surprise actors became figures in the Iran-Contra scandal, another secret arms-for-hostages scheme with Iran that was revealed in late 1986, despite White House denials.

According to official Iran-Contra investigations, the plot to sell U.S. weapons to Iran for its help in freeing American hostages then held in Lebanon involved Cyrus Hashemi, John Shaheen, Theodore Shackley, William Casey, Donald Gregg, Robert Gates, Robert McFarlane, George Cave, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

Yet, even as the cover-up of the Iran-Contra operations crumbled, key figures in Washington battled to keep the even more explosive October Surprise suspicions relegated to the loony bin of conspiracy theories, not to be taken seriously by the American people.

By the time the October Surprise case was gaining traction in 1991, neoconservatives had established themselves as important gatekeepers in the U.S. news media. Controversies that threatened to put Israel and Likud in a negative light were hotly contested.

So, in fall 1991, as Congress was deliberating whether to conduct full investigations of the October Surprise issue, Steven Emerson, a journalist with close ties to Likud, produced a cover story for the neoconservative New Republic claiming to prove the allegations were a “myth.”

Almost simultaneously, Newsweek published its own cover story also attacking the October Surprise allegations. The article, I was told, had been ordered up by executive editor Maynard Parker who was a close associate of Henry Kissinger and was known inside Newsweek as a big admirer of prominent neocon Elliott Abrams.

The two articles were influential in shaping Washington’s conventional wisdom, but they were both based on a misreading of attendance documents at a London historical conference which William Casey had gone to in July 1980.

The two publications put Casey at the conference on one key date—thus supposedly proving he could not have attended one of the Madrid meetings with Iranian emissaries. However, after the two stories appeared, follow-up interviews with conference participants, including historian Robert Dallek, conclusively showed that Casey wasn’t there.

Veteran journalist Craig Unger, who had worked on the Newsweek cover story, said the magazine knew the Casey alibi was bogus but still used it. “It was the most dishonest thing that I’ve been through in my life in journalism,” Unger later told me.

However, even though the Newsweek and New Republic stories had themselves been debunked, that didn’t stop other neoconservative-dominated publications, like the Wall Street Journal, from ladling out ridicule on anyone who dared take the October Surprise case seriously.

Emerson also was a close friend of Michael Zeldin, the deputy chief counsel for the House investigative task force. Though the task force jettisoned Emerson’s bogus Casey alibi, House investigators told me that Emerson frequently visited the task force’s offices and advised Zeldin and others how to read the October Surprise evidence.

Subsequent examinations of Emerson’s peculiar brand of journalism (which invariably toed the Likud line and often demonized Muslims) revealed that Emerson had financial ties to right-wing funders such as Richard Mellon Scaife and had hosted right-wing Israeli intelligence commander Yigal Carmon when Carmon came to Washington to lobby against Middle East peace talks.

In 1999, a study of Emerson’s history by John F. Sugg for Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting’s magazine “Extra!” quoted an Associated Press reporter who had worked with Emerson on a project as saying of Emerson and Carmon: “I have no doubt these guys are working together.”

The Jerusalem Post reported that Emerson has “close ties to Israeli intelligence.” And “Victor Ostrovsky, who defected from Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency and has written books disclosing its secrets, calls Emerson ‘the horn’ — because he trumpets Mossad claims,” Sugg reported.

Besides Emerson’s cozy relationship with task force deputy counsel Zeldin, Zeldin’s boss, chief counsel Lawrence Barcella, was a close personal friend of another influential neocon, Michael Ledeen, who was linked to the October Surprise mystery in the secret draft report prepared by Barcella’s staff.

However, after speaking with Ledeen, Barcella deleted references to his friend from the final report, the one that was issued publicly. [See Consortiumnews.com’s “October Surprise Crystal Ball.”]

Barcella also was the person inside the task force who apparently decided to withhold the damning Russian report from task force chairman Lee Hamilton.

In other words, a key “journalist” who supposedly debunked the October Surprise investigation is now recognized as something of a Likud propagandist, and the two lead investigators for the task force allowed neoconservative friends to influence the course of the inquiry.

However, even as Likud operatives and allies worked to derail any serious investigation, one top Likud official was more forthcoming.

In 1993, I took part in an interview with former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in Tel Aviv during which he said he had read Gary Sick’s 1991 book, October Surprise, which made the case for believing that the Republicans had intervened in the 1980 hostage negotiations to disrupt Carter’s reelection.

With the topic raised, one interviewer asked, “What do you think? Was there an October Surprise?”

“Of course, it was,” Shamir responded without hesitation. “It was.” Later in the interview, Shamir, who succeeded Begin as prime minister in the 1980s, seemed to regret his frankness and tried to backpedal on his answer, but his confirmation remained a startling moment.

The current knock on the October Surprise story is that it’s now ancient history and that it’s wrong to dig up unpleasant facts about the late President Ronald Reagan, who has become something of an icon on the Right and someone that MSNBC’s Chris Matthews recently deemed “one of the all-time greats” among presidents.

Further, Jimmy Carter is held in disdain by many Washington insiders, considered a “failed president.” In other words, the prevailing view is that things worked out just fine in replacing Carter with Reagan no matter how it was done and it makes no sense to rehash any of this unpleasantness.

However, there is another way to read the history: If Carter had freed the hostages and won a second term, the United States might have continued on a path toward alternative energy, the federal deficit would not have soared, and deregulation of corporations would not have opened the environment and the financial sector to such dangers.

Further, the United States might not have embarked on a massive military buildup or engaged in the aggressive intelligence operations that went with it. And, Israel might have been pushed into an equitable peace with its Palestinian neighbors three decades ago, rather than pursuing a settlement policy that now makes such an agreement close to impossible.

Possibly even more important, if the sabotaging of Carter’s reelection in 1980 had failed or at least if it had been exposed in the 1990s, the United States might now enjoy a much healthier democracy—based on hard truths, not comforting illusions.

48,"LeBron being a good progressive and keeping the hate and divide alive and well…

From Yahoo: LeBron James, who has consistently used his platform as one of the most famous men in America to discuss social issues, has said that NFL owners have a “slave mentality”.

The Los Angeles Lakers star made the comments on Friday’s broadcast of his HBO discussion show, The Shop. “In the NFL they got a bunch of old white men owning teams and they got that slave mentality,” James said. “And it’s like, ‘This is my team. You do what the f*ck I tell y’all to do. Or we get rid of y’all.’”

James’s comments come after a stormy few seasons in the NFL. Two players, Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid, have filed grievances against the league and its teams’ owners alleging they colluded to keep them out of football due to their stance on social issues. Both men knelt during the national anthem to highlight racial injustice in the United States. Although Reid has now found a team, the Carolina Panthers, this week he said he had been randomly drug tested by the league six times in 11 weeks. Yahoo Sports calculated the chances of that happening were 0.17%.

The NBA, on the other hand, has been praised for being much more progressive on social issues. “The difference between the NBA and the NFL, the NBA is what we believe he [a player] can be. The potential,” James said. “In the NFL, it’s like what can you do for me this Sunday, or this Monday or this Thursday, and if you ain’t it, we moving on.”

James highlighted the work of the NBA’s commissioner, Adam Silver, in making the league a welcoming environment for players. “I’m so appreciative in our league of our commissioner,” James said. “He doesn’t mind us having … a real feeling and to be able to express that. It doesn’t even matter if Adam agrees with what we are saying, he at least wants to hear us out. As long as we are doing it in a very educational, nonviolent way, then he’s absolutely OK with it.”

James has been quick to speak up about social issues in the past. He is a long-time critic of the US president, Donald Trump. In an interview with the web series Uninterrupted in January, James said of Trump: “The number one job in America … is someone who doesn’t understand the people, and really don’t give a f*ck about the people.”

In February, James explained why he was critical of the president: “While we cannot change what comes out of that man’s mouth, we can continue to alert the people that watch us, that listen to us, that this is not the way.”

184,"Where is it being played?

Egypt will host the 32nd African Cup of Nations, but that wasn't how it was intended to be. Cameroon were named as the host nation back in 2014. However, failure to provide adequate infrastructure at match venues, combined with the conflict between French- and English-speakers in the country, prompted Africa's CAF football federation to withdraw Cameroon's hosting rights in January.

The games will take place in four venues split between six stadiums. The capital Cairo boasts three stadiums: the Cairo International Stadium, the Al Salam Stadium and the June 30 Stadium (a controversial name referring to the fall of former President Mohamed Morsi in 2013). The other host cities are Suez, Alexandria and Ismailia. The final will take place in Cairo on 19 June at the Cairo International Stadium.

Who are the favorites?

It goes without saying that hosts Egypt, boasting Mo Salah in their side, and reigning champions Cameroon belong among the front-runners. But, as usual at this competition, narrowing the field of potential contenders is not easy.

Senegal, Morocco, Nigeria and Ghana are just some of the teams with at least a chance of claiming the title. Tanzania's coach Emmanuel Amunike hit the nail on the head when he warned to write nobody off: ""All the teams that are here are good,"" the 48-year-old former Sporting and Barcelona striker said.

The tournament also includes three countries that have never made the cut: Burundi, Mauritania and Madagascar.

Who are the stars?

With the games being played in Egypt, it's difficult to look far past Mohammed Salah. Liverpool's forward could an international title to his Champions League triumph. It would be Salah's first African Cup of Nations trophy; Egypt may lead Africa with seven titles, but they haven't won since 2007.

Liverpool are well represented throughout. Sadio Mane is surely Senegal's standout star, while Naby Keita will look to drive Guinea's midfield.

The contingent of leading Premier League stars is rounded out with Morocco and Manchester City winger Riyadh Mahrez. Fans and scouts alike will have their eyes on versatile Ajax attacker Hakim Ziyech, another member of Morocco's deep squad. Ziyech has been told he's free to leave, and reportedly dreams of a move to Barcelona or Arsenal. Several Bundesliga clubs are said to have put out feelers regarding the 26-year-old, the same goes for Inter Milan and AS Roma.

Fifteen Bundesliga players have made it to the tournament, including Guinea's Ibrahima Traore (Borussia Mönchengladbach), Senegal's Salif Sane (Schalke) and the Ivory Coast's Amadou Haidara (RB Leipzig).

What else is new?

For the first time, the competition is being played in the northern hemisphere's summer. In the past it took place in January and February, meaning that the star players at European clubs would miss an important phase of the domestic season. This scheduling fits the big teams better, but the higher temperatures could prove an extra burden on players already fatigued by a long season.

And, as in so many international competitions of late, expansion's the name of the game. For the first time, 24 teams rather than 16 will take part — following in the footsteps of Euro 2018 and the Women's World Cup.

The upshot's the same at the other competitions: very few teams will drop out in the group phase. Instead of two progressing from each group, now the top two from each of the six groups plus the four best-performing third-placed finishers will advance to the first knockout round of 16.",mainstream,M124d7,big.foot
1227,"Have you ever experienced a ""water failure""? That is, have you ever turned on your faucet and found that no water came out of it? If you get your water from a municipal water system, the answer is probably ""no.""

We have power failures all the time. Cable TV goes out fairly frequently. Although less common, the phone system goes down every so often, and it is now common to get an ""all circuits busy"" message when making long-distance calls. But the water in any city or suburb is always there. Water pressure is very reliable.

A big reason for that level of reliability is the water tower. You see water towers everywhere, especially if you live in a flat area full of small towns. Each water system has one or more towers. In this article, we will look at how water towers work. The next time you drive by a water tower, you will know exactly what it is doing.

A water tower is an incredibly simple device. Although water towers come in all shapes and sizes, they all do the same thing: A water tower is simply a large, elevated tank of water. For example, take the water tower shown at the right. This tower is located in Kill Devils Hill, near Kitty Hawk, NC. It is about 165 feet (50 meters) tall.

Water towers are tall to provide pressure. Each foot of height provides 0.43 PSI (pounds per square Inch) of pressure. A typical municipal water supply runs at between 50 and 100 PSI (major appliances require at least 20 to 30 PSI). The water tower must be tall enough to supply that level of pressure to all of the houses and businesses in the area of the tower. So water towers are typically located on high ground, and they are tall enough to provide the necessary pressure. In hilly regions, a tower can sometimes be replaced by a simple tank located on the highest hill in the area.

A water tower's tank is normally quite large. A normal in-ground swimming pool in someone's backyard might hold something like 20,000 or 30,000 gallons (that's a lot of water!), and a typical water tower might hold 50 times that amount! Typically, a water tower's tank is sized to hold about a day's worth of water for the community served by the tower. If the pumps fail (for example, during a power failure), the water tower holds enough water to keep things flowing for about a day.

One of the big advantages of a water tower is that it lets a municipality size its pumps for average rather than peak demand. That can save a community a lot of money.

Say that the water consumption for a pumping station averages 500 gallons of water per minute (or 720,000 gallons over the course of a day). There will be times during the day when water consumption is much greater than 500 gallons per minute. For example, in the morning, lots of people wake up at about the same time (say 7:00 a.m.) to go to work. They go to the bathroom, take a shower, brush their teeth, etc. Water demand might peak at 2,000 gallons per minute at 7 a.m. -- there is a big cost difference between a 500-gallon-per-minute pump and a 2,000-gallon-per-minute pump. Because of the water tower, the municipality can purchase a 500-gallon-per-minute pump and let the water tower handle the peak demand. At night, when demand normally falls to practically zero, the pump can make up the difference and refill the water tower.

In most towns, the water people drink comes from either a well, a river or a reservoir (normally a local lake). The water is treated in a water treatment plant to remove sediment (by filtration and/or settling) and bacteria (typically with ozone, ultraviolet light and chlorine). The output from the water treatment plant is clear, germ-free water. A high-lift pump pressurizes the water and sends it to the water system's primary feeder pipes. The water tower is attached to the primary feeders quite simply, as shown in this diagram:

If the pump is producing more water than the water system needs, the excess flows automatically into the tank. If the community is demanding more water than the pump can supply, then water flows out of the tank to meet the need.

Water towers come in all shapes and sizes. Take, for example, this giant peach along I-85 in Gaffney, South Carolina.

In a city, tall buildings often need to solve their own water pressure problems. Because the buildings are so tall, they often exceed the height that the city's water pressure can handle. So a tall building will have its own pumps and its own water towers. In the following picture, taken from the Empire State Building in New York City, there are at least 30 small water towers visible on the tops of these buildings.

Another interesting fact about water towers -- they can affect your insurance rates! During a fire, the water demand increases significantly and may greatly exceed the capacity of the pumps at the water plant. A water tower guarantees that there will be enough pressure to keep water flowing through the fire hydrants. Fire insurance rates are normally lower in a community in which the water system has water towers.

The next time you are out driving around, especially if you are driving through a series of small towns, take the time to notice the water towers. Now that you know how they work, you will be amazed by how many you see and by all the different forms they take!

1269,"Plans announced by the German government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack. Officials have ordered 50 million units of vaccine, since each person must be innoculated twice.

Berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 million euros ($850 million), although health insurance companies argue that one billion euros is more realistic.

Where to send the bill?

One big unanswered question remains; who will pay for the immunization program? Berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs, while they, in turn, have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients. The Federal Association of Local Authorities (DSTGB) insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations. Consumer and employer associations have also warned against attempting to pass on immunization costs.

""It's poison for employment, especially during this economic crisis,"" said the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHK) in a statement.

The benefits of such a massive program have not been adequately substantiated, according to Professor Gerd Glaeske, who researches pharmaceutical applications at the Center for Social Politics at the University of Bremen. “Vaccinations are not a panacea,” Glaeske said.

Some critics even suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine flu epidemic has been artificially created. They point to the very limited number of swine flu infections in Germany, none of which have been fatal.

“This is huge business for the pharmaceutical industry,” said Social Democrat deputy, Wolfgang Wodarg. ""The swine flu outbreak is no different from a normal flu outbreak"", he told the Neue Presse newspaper in Hanover. “Quite the opposite, if you compare the number of swine flu cases with other flu outbreaks. It's ridiculous,” he added.

The government plan, so far

The German Health Ministry late last month announced a draft plan outlining who will be immunized first. Those suffering from asthma, bronchitis, diabetes, certain immune deficiencies including HIV infections, or heart, liver and kidney ailments top the list, as well as pregnant women and the obese. Healthcare workers and public employees are also high on the list.

Meanwhile, it has been determined that a so-called PCR test, which could confirm if someone has swine flu, is too unreliable to be used except in extreme cases. The test failed to detect the presence of swine flu in half of all cases.

Berlin plans to immunize millions of citizens in a very short time to beat the start of the flu season. The DSTGB fears being overwhelmed with the task. It says the government's draft vaccination plan has not been carefully thought through and warns of confusion due to a poor allocation of responsibilities. It has called for local health authorities, doctors and clinics to be urgently informed of the government's specific plans.

A spokeswoman for the German Health Ministry said vaccination agreements will be finalized with Germany's 16 federal states over the next few weeks.

Germany's largest health insurer, AOK, has already suggested setting up four “Vaccination Sundays” in order to carry out the massive task of immunizing 680,000 people in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein within a very short space of time.

Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies, including Sanofi Pasteur, Novartis and CSL are producing the vaccine at top speed. But, although vaccinations are set to begin in the fall, final clinical tests could take more than a year.

Prodution of the swine flu vaccine will not be able to meet worldwide demand. To make the most efficient use of the doses available, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said in a press conference in Geneva on Thursday, that countries in the northern hemisphere should be the first to get the vaccine in September or October, when the flu season starts there. The WHO added that doctors and nurses in the southern hemisphere should also be among the first people to receive swine flu shots.",mainstream,M07fa6,big.foot

The space agency's Center for Near Earth Object Studies has observed the giant space rock approaching Earth at speeds of up to 28,500mph.

There's no need to panic though as the asteroid is expected to shoot straight past us.

Dubbed 438908 (2009 XO), Nasa has been keeping an eye on the space rock since it was first spotted in 2009.

It's estimated to measure between 210m to 470m, which means it could be up to 1,476ft across.

This would make it bigger than the Empire State Building.

Space experts think 438908 (2009 XO) will shoot safely past us on May 7 at 17:18 BST or 12:18 EST.

Cautious space agencies have labelled the asteroid ""potentially hazardous"" because it will come relatively 'close' to Earth.

Any fast moving space object that comes within around 4.65 million miles is considered to be ""potentially hazardous"" and making a ""close approach"".

The space rock should pass us at around 2.1million miles away.

1213,"Keep reading to learn about the causes of swollen toes and their associated symptoms. We also outline the potential treatment options associated with each cause.

Health professionals have identified several causes of swollen toes. Examples include injuries, infections, and various forms of arthritis . Each cause has its own management and treatment options.

There are 26 bones in the human foot, and 14 of these are in the toes. Toes play a critical role in balance and movement. Having a swollen toe can affect a person’s ability to balance and walk.

Causes and their symptoms

The sections that follow discuss some specific causes of toe swelling, and the other symptoms a person might experience.

Some common injuries that can cause a swollen toe include:
• dropping something heavy on the toe

Aside from swelling, people who injure their toe may also experience:

Some injuries involve a break in one or more bones within the toe. If the toe is broken, bruising may appear the day after the injury.

A stress fracture is a tiny hairline break in a bone. These tend to occur with repetitive activities such as running. The symptoms of a stress fracture are similar to those of a bone break, but they are usually less severe. Pain typically occurs during activity and stops during rest. The toe may swell but does not usually bruise.

Arthritis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the joints. It results in pain and tissue damage. It affects over one-third of people living in the United States.

There are many different types of arthritis. Two common types are osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

OA occurs due to general wear and tear of the joints. RA is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s own immune system attacks the joints and other tissues. Both types of arthritis may affect the joints within the toes.

Arthritis in the toes may result in pain, stiffness, and deformities in the joints. These deformities may appear as swellings.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a type of arthritis that affects some people with psoriasis. Psoriasis is an autoimmune condition that causes red plaques to develop on the skin. These are particularly common on the scalp and back, as well as around the joints.

Worldwide, about 125 million people have psoriasis, or around 2–3% of the world’s population. Researchers estimate that up to 30% of people with psoriasis also develop PsA.

People with PsA may have swollen toes and fingers that appear sausage-shaped. This is called dactylitis.

PsA can also affect the hips, knees, and spine.

Gout is another type of arthritis. This type causes crystals to form within and around the joints, resulting in inflammation and pain.

Gout most commonly occurs in the first metatarsophalangeal joint at the base of the big toe, but it can also occur in other joints, including the ankle and knee.

People with gout may experience intense joint pain that appears suddenly. Symptoms typically reach their maximum intensity within 24 hours of a flare-up. The swollen toe may appear red and feel warm to the touch.

Hallux rigidus is another type of arthritis that affects the metatarsophalangeal joint at the base of the big toe. Inflammation in this joint can cause pain and stiffness in the toe, which may also cause difficulty walking.

Hallux rigidus can also cause a bump to develop on the top of the foot. This bump may appear similar to a bunion or a callus.
• stiffness in the big toe, characterized by an inability to bend it up or down
• pain in the joint during activity, especially when pushing off on the toes while walking

An ingrown toenail is a nail that has grown into its surrounding skin, causing inflammation and infection. The inflamed area may appear as a bump.

Left untreated, an ingrown toenail can cause severe pain and discomfort. Some may require surgery.

Skin infections and soft tissue infections that affect the foot can cause the toes to swell. There are many potential causes of such infections. Examples include:

A bunion is a bump that develops on the joint at the base of the big toe. This occurs as a result of changes to the bones within the foot. These changes cause the big toe to lean in toward the second toe, instead of pointing straight ahead.

With time, the bones gradually drift further out of alignment, causing the bunion to grow.

Bunions can cause the following symptoms:
• pain or soreness at the site of the bump",mainstream,M0c180,big.foot

The round was led by Abbott with support from existing investors, including Quadrant Capital Advisors, Senvest Capital, Janus Henderson and Cormorant Asset Management, along with new investors including Smile Group.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200602005791/en/

Proceeds from the financing will support the completion of product development and FDA submission and clearance for the Bigfoot Unity™ System, part of the Bigfoot Unity™ Diabetes Management Program, a real-time, dose-decision support system for people with insulin-requiring diabetes relying on Multiple Daily Injection therapy, the most common form of insulin therapy for people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Bigfoot Unity utilizes proprietary, smart pen caps for basal and meal-time insulin dosing recommendations integrating Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre platform. FDA submission of Bigfoot Unity is anticipated in 2020 with a target launch soon after clearance.

“The current pandemic has only crystallized the need for medical solutions like ours that facilitate remote care, remote support and home delivery,” said Jeffrey Brewer, chief executive officer of Bigfoot Biomedical. “Necessity has forced a giant leap forward in telemedicine, and there will be no looking back. Raising $55 million in equity financing during this time of economic hardship underscores the urgency and focus on getting real-time solutions in the hands of patients, providers and payers.”

In conjunction with closing its Series C financing, Bigfoot also announced changes to its board of directors. Co-founder Bryan Mazlish will transition from day-to-day involvement as Bigfoot’s President to a new role as Executive Board Director focusing on the company’s strategy and governance initiatives. In addition, Joy Mashaal of Senvest Management has been appointed to the board of directors. Senvest has supported Bigfoot across every financing since 2016.

51,"What are the Chinese hiding in Wuhan?

I’ve been investigating and writing about fake epidemics for over 30 years. One of my prime strategies: were there hidden and unreported causes that would explain people’s symptoms and illnesses—causes having nothing to do with viruses? I found them. “The virus” turned out to be a convenient and very effective cover story that would obscure the true causes that important forces wanted to hide.

So I began looking into Wuhan, the center of the current “coronavirus epidemic.” I was particularly interested in the one symptom that was slightly different from the typical flu symptoms from past fake epidemics: the emphasis on lung problems and pneumonia.

Here is what I’ve found out so far.

First of all, Wuhan, a city of 11 million, is called “the Chicago of China.” It is both an economic juggernaut and a transportation hub—railroads, roads, highways connecting travelers to other Chinese cities.

Several sources list the annual GDP of Wuhan at a staggering $220 billion dollars.

230 foreign Fortune 500 companies have offices in Wuhan and do business there. All in all, 80 foreign countries are funding companies in the city.

The Chinese New Year is now underway. It lasts from January 25 to February 10. During this period, Chinse people travel. They journey far and wide. In fact, this is the largest annual human migration on the planet. We’re talking about hundreds of millions of people on the move. So it’s a devastating coincidence (?) that now there would be an epidemic and a massive lockdown of Chinese cities and transportation. Along with stopping people from moving around, enormous amounts of money are being lost because tourist consumers can’t go on the road and spend money. This might be called a clue. It would require much investigation. Is someone intentionally torpedoing the Chinese economy?

Then there is this, from Bloomberg News, “China Wants Activists to Stay Out of Its War on Pollution. Citizen activism in the mold of Greta Thunberg is all but taboo in the world’s biggest polluter,” January 23, 2020:

“When Premier Li Keqiang declared a ‘war against pollution’ in 2014, a few hundred residents of the city of Wuhan in central China took it as a cue.”

“They printed Li’s words on a six-meter (20 foot) banner and protested outside a foul-smelling incinerator plant they feared was causing illness in the community. Buoyed by the conviction they were answering the leadership’s call, the residents were instead harassed by local police officers who tore down the sign and trampled on it.”

“’We were worried and angry when we realized what was causing the stench and making our kids sick’, said Zhang Xijiao, 44, who was detained for a week for making the banner. ‘But we are like ants, the local government can crush us as they please’.”

“Ren Rui, 40, quit her apartment in 2017 after her son developed a lung condition that required repeat surgery. She said smoke from the plant would blow her way under certain conditions. She tried to rent it out, ‘but no one wants to move here. Sometimes my mood depended on the direction of the wind,’ said Ren. Despite the financial pressure since, ‘I never regretted moving away’.”

Let’s move on to another description of Chinese protests—in Wuhan.

CNN, July 11, 2019, “China has made major progress on air pollution. Wuhan protests show there’s still a long way to go”:

“…Recent weeks [in Wuhan] have seen major protests there — in themselves a rarity in China — over plans for a new garbage incineration plant.”

“Holding banners with slogans such as ‘we don’t want to be poisoned, we just need a breath of fresh air,’ thousands [!] of people took to the city’s streets over two weeks in June and July calling for the suspension of plans to build the plant.”

“’We are fearful that the plant is too close to residence area,’ one protester in the city of 10 million people told state media. Others expressed concern that emissions could worsen air pollution and harm residents’ health.”

“Local officials were apparently surprised by the scale and size of the protests, which came after several similar waste plants were reportedly found to be giving off dangerous emissions. Photos and videos shared on social media showed large crowds marching in the streets near where the plant was to be built, and police arresting numerous protesters.”

“The government has since suspended building of the plant, which locals said had halted protests, but a heavy police presence remains in the city where the situation is tense.”

“Public pressure has been the driving force of pollution policy in China, and it shows no sign of letting up.”

“In 2016, protesters took to the streets of Chengdu wearing face masks to demand action to tackle smog, while other demonstrations have targeted power and chemical plants in Sichuan, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang provinces in recent years.”

“The Chinese government is highly sensitive to the threat of protests like those in Wuhan, with the shadow of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre looming large. Calls for collective action are among the most censored subjects online, and people organizing protests or working for civil society groups can face harassment and imprisonment.”

In other words, protests against pollution in one Chinese city can inspire protests in other cities. A very dangerous situation for the Chinese government. Furthermore, it is generally acknowledged that official and corporate reports on pollution levels are being faked, to make “dangerous” into “healthy.”

Grist.org, June 12, 2012, “China’s smog city: What Wuhan looks like with 20 times the U.S. dust limit”:

“At about 2 a.m. local time Monday morning, a dense smog began to cover the province. By early afternoon, it reached its peak density in the land-locked city of Wuhan itself…The demonstrable danger is to lungs and bloodstreams.”

“The foul air of dozens of fast-expanding cities across China contains cocktails of toxic contaminants unprecedented in the range of pollutants they contain at high concentrations. Now, new research into these swirling maelstroms of gases and tiny particulates suggests that they may be incubating chemical reactions that compound the health effects in ways not seen before – effects that doctors say are cutting five years off the expected lifespan of half a billion people in northern China…China has the world’s most dangerous outdoor air pollution.”

“Three other cities listed as regularly suffering dangerous levels of four or five of the pollutants are Jining, also in Shandong, Wuhan in Hubei province, and Jiayuguan and Jinchang in Gansu. None of the seven appear in the lists of the ten most polluted Chinese cities published by the WHO or Chinese environment ministry.”

“All the five major pollutants in smogs – SO2, NOx, ozone, PM10 and PM2.5 — are known to be linked individually to increased risk of strokes, heart disease, lung cancer and asthma, and to rising hospital admissions and death rates during smogs. What is disturbing is that there is growing evidence of synergistic effects between these different pollutants that make the whole worse than the sum of the parts.”

Lung disease—and no need to invoke a virus to explain it.

We have two major clues here. One, the distinct possibility of an economic warfare attack against Wuhan and, during the Chinese New Year, against all of China. And two, the use of a coronavirus cover story to obscure huge pollution dangers and put down protests against that pollution, through mass lockdowns and quarantines.

Too many times to count them. Wherever in the world you would see extraordinary chemical pollution, grinding poverty, war, starvation, lethal dehydration, absence of basic sanitation, overcrowding in cities, horrendously contaminated water supplies, corporate takeover of farm land from the people, the highly destructive use of vaccines and toxic medical drugs and pesticides—you see a conscious and sustained effort to CONTROL the weakened population—and you will find the virus cover story publicized to the sky as the explanation for suffering, illness, and death.

• New Zealand's Ministry of Health says the country, which implemented one of the toughest lockdowns anywhere in the world, no longer has any active cases of coronavirus.
• Pakistan's coronavirus cases have crossed the 100,000 mark after 4,728 new infections were reported on Sunday.
• More than seven million people have now been confirmed to have the coronavirus with at least 409,000 dying from the disease, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US, the UK and Brazil have recorded the highest death tolls.

Here are the latest updates:

The government in Abu Dhabi extended by one week a ban introduced on June 2 that prohibits people from moving in and out of the emirate and travelling between its major cities.

The measures applies to all residents of Abu Dhabi, the largest member of the United Arab Emirates federation, with exceptions made for those working in vital sectors.

Movement within, but not between, the cities of al-Ain, al-Dhafra and Abu Dhabi is allowed outside the hours of a nightly curfew already in force to curb the spread of coronavirus.

Qatar to gradually lift lockdown in four phases

The Qatari government has unveiled a four-phase plan to gradually lift coronavirus restrictions.

The first phase beginning on June 15 will see, among others, the limited reopening of mosques, followed by a partial opening of restaurants on July 1.

Under phase 3, flights from low-risk countries will resume and shopping malls and markets with limited capacity will re-open on August 1.

Starting on September 1, wedding parties and business gatherings including exhibitions will also be permitted.

Causing further confusion over the real number of coronavirus cases and deaths, Brazil’s health ministry published data contradicting official figures uploaded to the ministry's online data portal.

The ministry said in a statement the discrepancy was predominantly due to mistakes in the numbers from two states that were later corrected. It explained that the later, lower daily death toll of 525 was the correct one.

""By changing the numbers, the Ministry of Health covers the sun with a sieve,"" Rodrigo Maia, speaker of the lower house, said on Twitter.

""The credibility of the statistics needs to be urgently recovered. A ministry that manipulates numbers creates a parallel world in order not to face the reality of the facts,"" he added.

Poland to shutdown dozens of coal mines over COVID-19

Poland announced the closure of a dozen coal mines for three weeks starting from Tuesday in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus as miners account for 20 percent of reported cases.

The move came as the country recorded its largest daily jump with 599 new infections.

""Such action is needed to eventually quell these epidemic outbreaks,"" Deputy Prime Minister Jacek Sasin told a news conference, adding that miners would receive full pay for the three weeks and coal deliveries would not be affected.

However, the news was not welcomed by the miners' Solidarity union that believes the closure would lead to a permanent shutdown of the mines as the government was already planning to restructure the industry.

Tunisian President Kais Saied has ordered the lifting of a nationwide curfew imposed in March to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.

The decision, announced by the presidency in a statement on Monday, came after health authorities said they continued to see a drop in the number of infections.

'Hunger is worse than corona': Sudanese demand end to lockdown

Car mechanic Mohamed Othman said the government must end its coronavirus lockdown so that he can get back to work because ""me and my family have no other source of income"".

Othman's feelings are echoed by many other Sudanese who say the government extended restrictive

measures without addressing their core economic needs.

Restricting measures imposed by governments in 11 European countries have averted the deaths of more than three million people, according to a new modelling study produced by the Imperial College of London.

""Our results show that major non-pharmaceutical interventions, and lockdown in particular, have had a large effect on reducing transmission,"" the authors said in the study, published in Nature Research.

Using European Centre of Disease Control data on deaths in 11 nations in the period up to May 4, they compared the number of observed deaths in the countries against those predicted by their model if no restrictions had been imposed.

As a result, they estimated that around 3.1 million deaths had been averted by the policies.

Meanwhile, the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives will offer soft loans worth 170 billion baht ($5.41bn) to shore up the farming sector.

US drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc has applied to a European Union health regulator for the approval of its antiviral drug, remdesivir, as a potential COVID-19 treatment in Europe.

""The assessment of the benefits and risks of remdesivir is being performed under a reduced timeline and an opinion could be issued within weeks depending on the robustness of the data submitted and whether further information is required to support the evaluation,"" the European Medicine Agency said in a statement.

The United Kingdom reported 55 new coronavirus-related deaths, the lowest since the lockdown was imposed on March 23.

It is the second consecutive day that the country recorded less than 100 fatalities, however the official reported numbers have been smaller during the outbreak due to lower reporting at weekends.

11:25 GMT - As India reopens, one state outnumbers China in cases

As India begins to reopen more public spaces after a 10-week lockdown, its western state of Maharashtra has crossed a grim milestone by having more coronavirus cases than China.

India's health ministry on Monday said Maharashtra - the country's most industrialised state - now has a total of 85,975 coronavirus cases, including more than 3,000 deaths.

As of Monday, China had 84,191 cases of the virus with 4,638 deaths so far, according to a tally by the Johns Hopkins University.

In South Africa, children started returning to classrooms on Monday as part of a gradual loosening of lockdown restrictions even as some parents worried that not enough had been done to protect the health of pupils.

The reopening of schools was delayed after teachers' unions urged school staff to defy the government order last week, saying schools lacked sufficient health and hygiene measures to keep educators and pupils safe.

Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga said on Sunday ramped-up efforts to equip schools over the past week meant that 95 percent of South Africa's primary and secondary schools were now able to host classes, and the biggest teachers union dropped its resistance to the reopening.

""The golden rule is there will be no school that will resume if not ready to do so,"" Motshekga said.

The government will find alternative arrangements for pupils at schools unable to open on Monday, she said.

South Africa has recorded nearly 50,000 cases of the new coronavirus - the most of any African country - along with almost 1,000 deaths.

10:35 GMT - Ryanair will not cancel flights despite start of UK travel quarantine rules

Ryanair will not cancel British flights despite Monday's start of what the boss of Europe's biggest budget airline called a ""rubbish"" 14-day quarantine for international arrivals.

Ryanair, easyJet and BA-owner IAG have threatened legal action over the quarantine, which they say will cripple the British tourism industry.

Asked by BBC Radio whether Ryanair would cancel July and August flights if the quarantine remained in place, group CEO Michael O'Leary said: ""No, because the flights are full outbound of the UK. British people are ignoring this quarantine, they know it's rubbish.""

The three airlines have sent a ""pre-action protocol letter"", which can be followed by legal action, in the most vociferous clash between the UK government and the industry since the pandemic began.

Airlines have warned it could deter British travellers, some of the top spenders, from flying to Europe and prevent Europeans from visiting cities such as London and Edinburgh and sites including Stonehenge.

There were 41 million visits to the UK in 2019, according to the national tourism agency, with visitors spending $36bn and supporting millions of jobs.

Norway's government-run wine and liquor monopoly increased its sales by 44 percent in May from the same month last year as coronavirus travel restrictions prevented the purchase of cheaper alcohol abroad, the Vinmonopolet retailer said.

Norway closed its borders in mid-March to most foreigners and imposed quarantine restrictions on anyone returning home from abroad, while also shutting its restaurants, thus leaving Vinmonopolet as the only source of alcohol other than beer.

""Sales have increased, but not more than could be expected in light of the halt to border trade, duty-free stores and restaurants, bars and cafes,"" Vinmonopolet spokesman Jens Nordahl said in a statement.

On May 29, Norway agreed to allow travel from neighbouring Denmark to resume from June 15 while maintaining quarantines for all other nations, including Sweden - a popular destination for Norwegians seeking to save on their alcohol bill.

10:10 GMT - Indonesia records more than 800 new COVID-19 cases

The Southeast Asian country has tested more than 274,400 people for the virus, according to a document compiled by its COVID-19 taskforce.

Some 10,904 patients have recovered, the ministry said.

Pakistan's former Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, his family and party confirmed.

Abbasi, who served as prime minister for 10 months from 2017 to 2018 following the disqualification of three-time Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, has gone into self-isolation.

Meanwhile, Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, and former health minister for northeast Punjab province, Khawaja Salman Rafiq, have also contracted the virus.

A spokesman for Pakistan Railways confirmed that Ahmed, who has no apparent symptoms, has isolated himself at his home in Rawalpindi after testing positive.

Other high-profile politicians who were infected in Pakistan include governor of the southeastern Sindh province Imran Ismail, and parliament speaker Asad Qaiser.

08:30 GMT - Heathrow boss says millions of jobs could be lost if planes stay grounded

Hundreds of thousands of jobs, if not millions, could be lost in Britain if aviation is not able to resume quickly, the chief executive of London's Heathrow Airport said.

The UK introduced a 14-day quarantine period for international arrivals on Monday despite warnings from its biggest airlines that the move will decimate domestic tourism and damage exports.

""We cannot go on like this as a country,"" Chief Executive John Holland-Kaye told Sky News. ""We need to start planning to reopen our borders.

""If we don't get aviation moving again quickly, in a very safe way, then we are going to lose hundreds of thousands if not millions of jobs in the UK just at the time when we need to be rebuilding our economy.""

08:00 GMT - Beijing calls on US senator to present evidence of China COVID-19 vaccine 'sabotage'

China said US Senator Rick Scott should present the evidence for his accusation that Beijing is trying to slow down or sabotage the development of a COVID-19 vaccine by Western countries.

The Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, made the remarks during a daily briefing on Monday, responding to the Republican senator's comments during an interview on BBC TV.

Scott declined to give details on the evidence when asked during the interview but said it had come through the intelligence community.

Malls and temples reopened in several cities across India on Monday despite the country reporting a record daily number of new coronavirus infections, with the pandemic expected to ravage the country for weeks to come.

After a 10-week lockdown, the government has risked lifting some restrictions in a bid to ease the devastating blow to the economy dealt by the coronavirus.

But the number of new cases rose by 9,983 to 256,611, according to government figures announced on Monday, putting the country of 1.3 billion on course to overtake the UK and Spain among nations with the highest number of infections.

The reported death toll of 7,135 is much lower than reported in other badly-hit countries, but the epidemic is only expected to peak locally in July, according to health experts.

Meanwhile, in Thailand, seven new coronavirus infections and no new deaths were reported on Monday, with the new cases found in quarantine, taking the country to two weeks without local transmission.

Thailand has reported 77 cases in the past 14 days and all were contained after being imported from overseas, said Taweesin Visanuyothin, a spokesman for the government's Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration.

The total number of confirmed cases stands at 3,119, with 58 deaths.

Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has declared the coronavirus pandemic ""under control"" after the island nation registered an eighth straight day without a death from COVID-19.

It paves the way for an announcement next week on Cuba's strategy to gradually lift its lockdown.

 

The country of 11.2 million has recorded just under 2,200 cases and 83 deaths from the virus. With 1,862 people having recovered, Cuba has only 244 active cases.

 



However, Diaz-Canel said the country could not become complacent given a spate of new infections since May 28.

""We need to keep focusing on how we're going to eliminate the residues that remain, especially those associated with the incompetence or poor functioning of any institution, which give rise to events that can provoke a rebound,"" he said.

Denmark has lifted the limit on public gatherings to 50 people from 10 as it relaxes measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus, the ministry of health has said.

The restrictions on public gatherings were put in place on March 17.

In Pakistan, coronavirus cases increased at a rapid pace last week, crossing the 100,000 mark on Sunday, according to government data. Also on Sunday, the country registered 4,728 new cases, taking the total since the outbreak began in late February to 103,671, the data shows.

At least 68 people died on Sunday, bringing the death toll countrywide to 2,121, according to the data. On average, cases rose by 4,458 cases per day last week, a doubling from the rate of a week before.

Pakistan's government has largely lifted restrictions on businesses and economic activity, with Prime Minister Imran Khan cautioning citizens to police themselves and follow hygiene guidelines in order to avoid infection.

Last week, Khan ordered the tourism sector be reopened across the country.

There is a great deal of happiness in New Zealand which has managed to stop community transmission of the coronavirus and will return to a near-normal life in a few hours. Globally, the picture does not seem quite as encouraging with the number of cases now in excess of seven million and the Americas the epicentre of the pandemic. Some countries are looking to reopen though - the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, loosened restrictions on Monday morning.

More than 70 ships are lined up at the Brazilian port of Santos waiting to load some three million tonnes of sugar as the coronavirus complicates efforts to fulfil a rush of orders as a result of poor harvests in India and Thailand.

Reuters news agency says the queue could take as long as a month to clear.

""It is mayhem in Santos,"" one sugar trader told the news agency.

Traders are worried how the ships will be cleared with Brazil now reporting the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in the world.

""The situation has been complicated by the virus,"" said Stephen Geldart, head of analysis at Czarnikow Group, a food supply chain services company. ""Everyone is nervous about what happens if vessels are unable to berth or load quickly.""

05:00 GMT - No local transmission for two weeks in Thailand

There has been no local transmission of coronavirus in Thailand for the past two weeks, with all 77 cases over the last 14 days imported from overseas.

Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the government's Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration says the authorities confirmed seven new cases of the disease on Monday with no deaths. All the cases were among people returning from overseas and they were quarantined, he said.

Hong Kong has announced quota-based exemptions to compulsory quarantine for directors and executives of certain listed companies who travel to mainland China.

Eligible companies must apply for the exemption and those who travel will be subject to a number of conditions. A maximum of two directors and executives can be nominated each calendar month.

""We strive to balance the need of safeguarding public health and promoting Hong Kong's economic development,"" Christopher Hui, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, said in a statement.

""The new scheme will facilitate directors or executives of sizeable Hong Kong-listed companies to perform business activities that are essential to their operation. This is conducive to maintaining the normal business operation of these enterprises under the very dynamic and challenging business environment.""

New cases of coronavirus have slowed in South Korea but concerns remain over a second wave of the outbreak in Seoul as the country entered the final phase of its plan to reopen schools.

On Monday morning, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced 38 new cases compared with 57 the day before, according to Yonhap news agency.

Of the 38 new cases, 33 were locally-transmitted - all of them in the Seoul metropolitan area. Distancing restrictions that had been relaxed have recently been tightened again.

03:10 GMT - New Zealand to lift last COVID-19 curbs at midnight, borders stay closed

New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is speaking now.

She has announced that New Zealand will lift its last remaining restrictions to curb the coronavirus at midnight (12:00 GMT) when the country will return to Level 1 on its four-level system of alerts.

Ardern said New Zealand had introduced a strict lockdown 75 days ago with the aim of getting to a level ""where life feels as normal as it can in the midst of a global pandemic. Today, I can announce that cabinet has agreed we can now move to Level 1.""

International borders will remain closed given the challenge of COVID-19 around the world.

""There's no denying this is a milestone,"" Ardern said. ""Thank you, New Zealand.""

554,"Though climate policy is shifting from inertia to action, thanks in part to the commitment of a new U.S. administration, recent G-8 and U.S. domestic efforts are inadequate to address the threat of climate change. Any climate framework that ignores the role of publicly funded institutions, like the World Bank, will fall short.

World Bank-funded energy projects produce a significant proportion of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. The CO2 emissions from the fossil fuel projects that the World Bank Group financed in the fiscal year of 2008 are approximately equivalent to those from Greece’s energy sector.

The World Bank continues to promote development models based on a prolonged reliance on fossil fuels, illustrated by its 59 percent increase in fossil fuel lending over the last three years. Every additional coal investment ensures future greenhouse gas emissions for the multiple-decades-long lifespan of the coal plant. If the rest of the world is talking emissions targets at long last, why is the World Bank playing saboteur?

The bank must accept its role in transitioning countries onto a low-carbon development trajectory by shifting its energy investments away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy projects. Developed and developing countries alike will be held to increasingly stringent emissions standards in the coming years. World Bank investments in renewable energy now will lessen the burden developing countries will face in meeting these standards in the future.",mainstream,M0b2e9,big.foot
175,"Last month Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates surpassed Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to once again become the world’s richest individual, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Buoyed by an enormous 48 percent increase in Microsoft’s share price this year, Gates has retaken the title he last held in 2017.

That outcome is partially owed to the whims of Donald J. Trump. Microsoft recently surprisingly defeated Amazon’s bid for an extremely lucrative $10 billion Pentagon cloud computing contract that sees the company instantly become one of the world’s most important military and security contractors. This decision, Amazon alleges, was due to interference from the president who holds a personal grudge against Bezos, whose Washington Post has maintained a campaign of “resistance” against him.

Gates was also recently in the news attacking the wealth tax that Democratic presidential nomination candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have proposed. “I’m all for super-progressive tax systems but when you say I should pay $100 billion, then I’m starting to do a little math about what I have left over,” the Seattle native said. (For the record, he would still have over $6 billion).

In response, Warren was apologetic, asking for an opportunity to meet with Gates to explain how much he would pay under the plan. “I promise it’s not $100 billion,” she said. But Sanders has been far more forthright in his opposition to the super-wealthy, categorically stating, “billionaires should not exist.”

Across the media, Gates is presented as one of the “good billionaires”: a warm-hearted philanthropist dedicated to giving away his entire fortune to needy causes. His charitable organization, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is the largest of its sort in the world, holding over $50 billion in assets. His insight and generosity are constantly emphasized in headlines, as the following examples demonstrate.

“How Bill Gates aims to Clean Up the Planet,” The Guardian, (2/4/18).

“What Einstein and Bill Gates Teach Us About Time Travel,” NBC News, (5/10/17).

“Bill Gates And Other Billionaires Pledge To Take On Climate Change,” NPR, (11/30/15).

“Bill Gates on ending disease, saving lives: ‘Time is on our side,’” Al-Jazeera, (4/27/19).

“Bill Gates gives $4.6bn to charity in biggest donation since 2000,” The Guardian, (8/15/17).

There are a few problems with that narrative. Firstly, if Gates is so committed to giving his money away, why does he keep getting richer? This is not a trivial question: his net worth has increased from $75 billion in March 2016 to a staggering $106 billion today, according to Forbes Magazine, an over 40 percent increase in three years alone.

Lee Camp, a political comedian who covers topics like rampant inequality on his show, Redacted Tonight, told MintPress News:

Linsey McGoey, Professor of Sociology at the University of Essex, UK, and author of No Such Thing as a Free Gift: The Gates Foundation and the Price of Philanthropy, is profoundly skeptical of philanthropy as a whole, claiming it can actually sometimes harm democracy in the long run: “Philanthropy can and is being used deliberately to divert attention away from different forms of economic exploitation that underpin global inequality today” she told MintPress News,

Thus, huge donations give Gates enormous power over the education, health and social policies of entire countries.

Where do Bill’s billions go?

As Foreign Affairs noted, “few policy initiatives or normative standards set by the World Health Organization are announced before they have been casually, unofficially vetted by Gates Foundation staff.” In this sense, his wealth is extraordinarily anti-democratic, giving him veto power over the decisions and directions of organizations that should be collectively made by the highest representatives of the world’s population, not by one very rich man. And Gates is far from omnipotent, holding many of the patronizing assumptions about developing countries and how best to organize the world that one would expect a rich American tech geek to hold.

McGoey spells out the problem with this corporate attitude to development:

One example of the Foundation enhancing corporate power is its close relationship with highly controversial pharmaceutical and chemical giant Monsanto Corporation, whom it helped gain a stronger foothold in Africa. It also oversaw a flawed clinical trial of the HPV vaccine in India in 2009, where 23,000 impoverished girls aged 9-15 were exposed to potentially lethal drugs without even their parents’ consent, leading to seven deaths. He is also preoccupied with controlling Africa’s population through family planning, fearing a population boom. As such, he appears almost more interested in eliminating the people who are suffering than the source of the suffering itself.

Gates is also one of the most important individuals leading the assault on the American public education network in the form of charter schools. Charter schools effectively privatize the public school system, where the public continues to foot the bill for the school, but has no influence or say in how it is run. They have not been found to increase test scores, but are very popular with both the private sector and the religious right, whereas the vast majority of unionized public school teachers oppose them. But, as the Associated Press stated, there is “no bigger champion [of charter schools] than Bill Gates,” who has plowed enormous amounts of money into the movement, even funding the pro-charter school documentary Waiting For Superman.

If Gates represents a net negative force in world politics, why does he receive such good press? One reason may be his sizeable donations to a host of mainstream corporate media outlets. For example, the Gates Foundation underwrites the entire Global Development section of the Guardian, and has given the British newspaper over $9 million. Studying its donation database, it transpires it has also contributed over $3 million to NBC Universal, over $4 million to the influential French newspaper, Le Monde, over $4.5 million to NPR, $1 million to Al-Jazeera, and an astonishing $49 million to the BBC’s Media Action program, to name only a few. He who pays the piper, it is said, calls the tune. McGoey claims that the motive of billionaires giving to media organizations is primarily “to help legitimate the spurious idea that large corporate actors can rectify the economic harms and economic inequality that their practices have often compounded.”

Gates himself is the head of a gigantic media empire. We already rely on Microsoft for social media (LinkedIn), entertainment (Xbox), hardware and software like the Windows Phone and Windows OS. The company also owns stakes in media giants like Comcast and AT&T. And the “MS” in “MSNBC” stands for “Microsoft.”

It is a similar story for Jeff Bezos, who, in addition to Amazon’s myriad media ventures, owns the Washington Post, which media watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting has constantly shown often descends into little more than a propaganda outlet for its boss’s interests. It appears that once billionaires have purchased every worldly material good possible, the only things left to buy are power and influence.

While the media may be full of stories singing Gates’ praises, presenting him as a good billionaire (as opposed to the current president), the reality is that one man with that amount of power, be it political (like Trump) or economic (like Gates and Bezos) has a highly corrosive effect on democracy and society more generally.

While they are portrayed as visionaries, multi-billionaires are often blinkered in other, very important ways. Just as reports about Amazon workers’ poor pay and shocking working conditions were surfacing, Bezos declared that the only way he could see to spend the financial resources he accrued was to explore the solar system and beyond. Sharing the profit with his beleaguered workforce appears to genuinely not have occurred to him.

If we are to move towards a better society, the philanthropy of the super-wealthy must be scrutinized, as all too often, what appears to be a generous gift is actually a calculated action intended to increase their power, image or influence. As former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee said, “Charity is a cold grey loveless thing. If a rich man wants to help the poor, he should pay his taxes gladly, not dole out money at a whim.” Bill Gates is not just some rich guy who is unsure about paying more tax: he’s a menace to society.

As 2016 continues to unfold, the manifestations of human activity are turning into a tidal wave of global decimation and destruction. From Florida, to Vietnam, to South America, the massive sea life die-offs continue to escalate.

Volcanic and seismic activity are also spiraling upward. Some may consider such events completely natural, but is that truly the case? The equation is much more complicated. With the planet now warming at blinding speed due to anthropogenic activity, thermal expansion has become a factor relating to geologic and seismic events. Ice is melting so fast over land masses like Greenland and Antarctica that ""glacial rebound"" must also be considered. Finally (and perhaps most importantly) what part may the military/industrial complex controlled global ionosphere heaters be playing in the increasingly catastrophic geological activity?

The HAARP ionosphere heater facility in Alaska is only one of many in the global network of ionosphere installations

Earth's atmosphere has long since been completely saturated with electrically conductive heavy metal nano-particles from the constant geoengineering jet spraying dispersions. The constant microwaving of the atmosphere by the ionosphere heater installations can only add to the overall runaway warming and destruction of our biosphere.

970,"OK, enough with the grainy footage, the first-person accounts and questionable evidence. Spike TV is looking to get to the bottom of this whole Bigfoot mystery once and for all with its next reality competition series, “10 Million Dollar Bigfoot Bounty.”

Not surprisingly, the series, which premieres Jan. 10, hasn’t attracted a whole lot of what you would call studious, academic types. Instead, you get a whole lot of angry, sexist rednecks yelling at each other in the woods. What better way to attract a notoriously camera-shy, quite probably mythical creature, than to have a bunch of people arguing in the woods?

But it makes for watchable TV.

Dean Cain hosts the show, which claims to offer the biggest cash prize in TV history. Though prize underwriters Lloyd’s of London probably aren’t losing much sleep over this one. The conditions for winning are definitive visual and DNA proof of Bigfoot’s existence.

PHOTOS: Behind the scenes of movies and TV

Two scientific experts will be on hand for the series: Todd Disotell, a biological anthropologist who runs New York University’s molecular primatology lab and Natalia Reagan, a primatology expert.

According to Spike, DNA evidence will be processed using a mobile DNA lab. If no definitive proof is found, the group that presented the “most compelling evidence and theory” will be awarded a $100,000 research grant to keep searching.

The series is just the latest in Hollywood’s recent preoccupation with Bigfoot. As The Times wrote last year, Bigfoot has been the subject of Animal Planet’s series “Finding Bigfoot,” the “iCarly” episode “iBelieve in Bigfoot,” a horror film called “Exists” from “Blair Witch Project” director Eduardo Sanchez and the documentary film “Sasquatch: The Quest.”

Any chance that $10-million prize will actually get awarded? Keep dreaming, Bigfoot lovers.

1178,"A naked man who claimed he was 'from a family of sasquatch' has been jailed for ten years after attacking an armed hunter in the woods.

Jeff McDonald had gone out hunting for deer near his home in Manning, Oregon, when he saw Linus Norgren wearing what appeared to be 'tan clothing'.

But when he got closer, Mr McDonald, who was carrying a high-powered rifle, realized that 22-year-old Norgren was in fact naked.

He told Oregon Live how he asked him for his name and received a normal response before Norgren said that he was 'a sasquatch from a family of sasquatches'.

After offering to help take him home, Norgren struck Mr McDonald on the head with a rock, causing him to black out.

When he woke up, Oregon Live reports, Norgren was on top of him and squeezing his hands tightly around his neck while Mr McDonald had suffered two dislocated shoulders.

As the struggle unfolded he asked his attacker why he was trying to kill him to which Norgren replied: 'Sasquatch kills the hunter'.

Mr McDonald said he managed to bite one of Mr Norgren's knuckles before the attacker appeared to 'pass out' on top of him. After a further struggle he managed to free himself and reach his gun, according to reports.

Pointing his rifle at Norgren, he called 911.

According to KPTV, McDonald told authorities they needed to get there quick, 'because I only have one option here and you know what it is'.

Deputies eventually found them in thick forest after a 90 minute search.

McDonald had held Norgren at gunpoint the whole time.

In court this week, Norgren said he was suffering 'catastrophic mental disturbances' at the time.

Jurors were told that he had experiences symptoms of his 'untreated bipolar disorder', Oregon Live reports, while Norgren also told the court that he was acting in self-defense.

'I was injured already, I was naked and I was terrified,' Norgren said in court Tuesday, KPTV reported.

'Not to make excuses for myself, but Mr. McDonald's presence was absolutely terrifying.

'I truly believed I needed to defend myself to get out of that situation and go home.

'I didn't want to hurt him, I didn't want to hurt Mr. McDonald.

'I didn't want to kill him. I didn't want anything to happen to either of us.'

But the self defence argument was rejected by jurors and Norgren was convicted of attempted murder and three counts of second-degree assault.

He was cleared of further charges of first degree assault and unlawful use of a weapon.

Oregon Live reports that his defense lawyer said he was unable to use an 'insanity defense' without Norgren's consent but suggested the evidence of mental illness should be a 'mitigating factor'.

Norgren was jailed for ten years at Washington County Circuit Court this week, a year and a half after the incident in October 2013.",mainstream,M12136,big.foot
54,"After a tortuous 20-year-long excavation, a mysterious ancient skeleton is starting to give up its secrets about human evolution.

The first of a raft of papers about ‘Little Foot’ suggests that the fossil is a female who showed some of the earliest signs of human-like bipedal walking around 3.67 million years ago. She may also belong to a distinct species that most researchers haven’t previously recognized.

“It’s almost a miracle it’s come out intact,” says Robin Crompton, a musculoskeletal biologist at the University of Liverpool, UK, who has collaborated with the research team that excavated the skeleton.

As well echoing the mythical ‘Bigfoot’, the nickname Little Foot comes from the small size of the foot bones that were among the first parts of the skeleton to be discovered.

The first signs that there was an invaluable hominin specimen up for grabs came in 1994. Ronald Clarke, a palaeoanthropologist at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits University) in Johannesburg, South Africa, was rifling through boxes of fossils at a field laboratory at the Sterkfontein caves, about 40 kilometres northwest of Johannesburg. He realized that a handful of small bones in the collection belonged to an early hominin.

He established that the bones were those of a species of Australopithecus — ape-like hominins that were present in Africa between about 4 million and 2 million years ago, before the human genus Homo rose to dominance1.

Clarke and his colleagues then found many more bones embedded in a matrix of solid rock deep in the Sterkfontein caves. They began carefully excavating Little Foot, piece by fragile piece, using hammers and chisels, followed by precision tools. The entire process took them almost 20 years.

“The fossilized bone is actually softer than the matrix,’ says Crompton. “It’s been an absolute devil to get it out.”

By late last year, Clarke’s team had successfully removed enough bones to reconstruct more than 90% of the skeleton, and the specimen was unveiled to the world. No other Australopithecus fossil comes close to that level of completeness. For comparison, the most famous Australopithecus — Lucy — is around 40% complete.

On 29 November, Clarke’s team, posted two papers on Little Foot to the bioRxiv preprint server — one on the age of the specimen2, the other on the limbs and locomotion3. On 4 December, the researchers posted a third, on the skull and on the potential relationship to a known hominin species4. The team posted a fourth paper5, this time focusing on the arms and an injury Little Foot received during her life, on 5 December.

Further papers, on the hand, teeth and inner ear, are expected in the near future, says Crompton. Most will ultimately appear in a special edition of the Journal of Human Evolution.

The bioRxiv papers crystallize ideas that emerged in earlier publications about the age of the fossil. They also cover some new ground, suggesting that Little Foot was an adult female and stood about 130 centimetres tall — just 10 centimetres shorter than the average woman in some modern-human populations. “Little Foot was quite big,” says Crompton.

The paper covering limbs and locomotion3 reveals that Little Foot’s legs are longer than her arms, similar to modern humans, making her the oldest hominin for which we can be sure of that feature, says Crompton. This means that Little Foot was better adapted to walking upright on the ground than many other australopiths, at least some of which seem to have spent more time moving through trees.

Little Foot’s skull bones and teeth are so unusual that Clarke and his colleagues have categorized her as a distinct species4. They chose not to give this species a new name, but instead designate it as Australopithecus prometheus.

A. prometheus was suggested in 1948 on the basis of a skull fragment found roughly 250 kilometres north of Johannesburg6, but quickly fell out of fashion when researchers decided it was simply an unusual representative of an already recognized species, called A. africanus. Clarke doesn’t think that Little Foot belongs to A. africanus, and says the simplest option is to resurrect the name A. prometheus for Little Foot and a handful of similar fossils.

The preprint also suggests that A. prometheus is potentially an ancestor of a group of hominins called Paranthropus4, which co-existed with early Homo species for about a million years.

Lee Berger, an archaeologist also at Wits University who was not involved in the excavations, but is working on publications about Little Foot, disagrees with the decision to resurrect A. prometheus. In a paper that is scheduled to be published on 10 December in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, Berger argues that the name A. prometheus was never properly defined.

He hasn’t yet decided whether Little Foot constitutes a distinct species — but if she does, Berger thinks a new name is needed.

Berger adds he is disappointed by the lack of solid information in the papers on the age and locomotion findings — he would have liked to have seen detailed measurements of the fossil bones, for instance. “There’s no data — there are almost no measurements of the fossils,” he says. Berger hopes to provide those data in his own publications — although he is still at an early stage of his analysis.

Crompton responds that the locomotion paper is essentially an overview that attempts to reconstruct how Little Foot moved by drawing on the solid data given in the other papers. More-detailed data can be found in the team’s other papers, he says.

Gabriele Macho, a biological anthropologist at the University of Oxford, UK, agrees that the locomotion paper is light on solid data, but notes that the team acknowledges that it is a work in progress.

She looks forward to see more-detailed papers in the future. “The positive thing is this skeleton is tremendously important,” she says. “No question about it.”",mainstream,M0fc2c,big.foot
881,"When The Sound of Music debuted on cinema screens in April 1965, audiences fell hard and in huge numbers for the joyous celebration of music, dance, patriotism and familial and romantic love, propelling it to become one of the world’s most beloved movie musicals and turning the story of the von Trapp family into lore.

Like many true stories filtered through Hollywood’s often overly sentimental lens, The Sound of Music on-screen differs significantly from the true tale of Maria, the novice nun who takes a job as a governess in the Austrian household of the von Trapps, only to find herself falling in love with widower and retired naval captain Georg von Trapp and his seven children.

The film stars Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer as Maria and Georg, and features enduring songs such as “Do-Re-Mi,” “How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria,” “Climb Ev’ry Mountain” and “Edelweiss.” It received five Academy Awards (including best picture) and is the third highest-grossing movie of all time in the U.S. after its box office is adjusted for inflation.

A cinematic recreation of the 1959 Broadway musical featuring music and lyrics by Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein, the Robert Wise-directed movie is based on the early chapters of Maria's 1949 memoir, The Story of the Trapp Family Singers, which chronicles Maria and the von Trapp’s beginnings in Salzburg, Austria, through their escape from Nazi-occupied Europe to the family’s eventual relocation to America.

To use lyrics from “Do-Re-Mi,” when it comes to alterations and omissions contained in the movie version of The Sound of Music, “let’s start at the very beginning.”

The real Maria described herself as 'horrid'

Maria Augusta Kutschera was born in 1905 and after being orphaned at a young age, was reportedly sent to live with an abusive uncle. She attended teachers' college where she discovered religion and converted to Catholicism before becoming a candidate for the novitiate in Salzburg. Portrayed on film by Andrews as demure and self-effacing, the real Maria was in fact a real problem while at the convent, describing herself as “horrid, the worst you can imagine,” in a 1980 article which includes a list of transgressions such as breaking china, speaking during periods of silence, running in the courtyard, whistling Gregorian chants and climbing on the convent roof.

The names of the von Trapp children – and amount – were changed in the movie

In 1926 Maria was sent from the convent to tutor only one of Captain von Trapp’s seven children from his first marriage. Georg’s second eldest daughter, Maria, had contracted scarlet fever – the same disease that took his first wife’s life four years prior – and could no longer travel the distance to and from school.

Most readers by now have questioned the name of Georg’s daughter listed above. It’s no surprise the name is not familiar as one of the children’s, in fact, all the names and sexes of the seven von Trapp children represented in the movie were changed. The real von Trapp children were (in age descending order) Rupert, Agathe, Maria, Werner, Hedwig, Johanna and Martina.

On screen Rupert became Liesl, a 16 going on 17-year-old girl. In real life, by the time the family fled Austria, Rupert was in his late twenties and a practicing physician.

Even the number of children was not correct in the movie. When the von Trapps escaped Austria there were in fact nine children: seven from Georg’s first marriage and two from his marriage to Maria, Rosmarie and Eleonore. The tenth child, Johannes, was born in America in 1939.

The real family wasn't as wealthy as portrayed on screen

Though money did not appear to be of concern to the family depicted in the movie, in real life the fortunes of the von Trapp family had faltered during the global depression of the early 1930s to the extent that at the time the film is set, most of the household servants had been dismissed and the family had begun taking in boarders. The lack of funds also prompted the family to consider turning their love of singing together into a profession. “It almost hurt [my father] to have his family on stage, not from a snobbish view, but more from a protective one,” Eleonore is quoted as saying in a 1978 Washington Post interview.

The von Trapps were a musical household well before Maria entered their lives

Both in real and reel life, the family singers won first place in the Salzburg Music Festival. But the sound of music was already well established within the household before Maria arrived. In a reversal of the stern, music-forbidding retired naval officer depicted in the film, the real Georg and his first wife encouraged song in the family home years before Maria arrived. “In reality, Georg was a warm and loving if somewhat overwhelmed father,” author Tom Santopietro writes in The Sound of Music Story. “It was actually Maria herself, with her emotionally stunted upbringing, who needed thawing.”

Like the film, Maria and Georg were in fact married only a year after the novice arrived as governess. Unlike the film, they were actually married in 1927, more than a decade before fleeing Austria in 1938. Georg was 25 years older than Maria and the match was not love at first sight. Though Georg had fallen for Maria and asked her to stay with him and become a second mother to his children, Maria was not as sure of the union, reportedly saying, “God must have made him word it that way because if he had only asked me to marry him I might not have said yes.”

The real von Trapps did not secretly cross the alps by foot

The family’s exit from Austria under Nazi occupation was also given a glossy Hollywood treatment, depicting the von Trapps as having to cross the alps on foot to avoid detection. In reality such a journey would have brought them to directly into Germany, not Switzerland as in the film. “Don’t they know geography in Hollywood? Salzburg does not border on Switzerland!” complained Maria to a reporter in 1967.

Though they left Austria only a day before the borders were sealed, their actual departure lacked the drama contained in the film according to documents and interviews contained in the U.S. National Archives. “We did tell people that we were going to America to sing,” daughter Maria told Opera News in 2003. “And we did not climb over mountains with all our heavy suitcases and instruments. We left by train in broad daylight, pretending nothing.”

The von Trapps traveled with their musical conductor, Rev. Franz Wasner, and secretary Martha Zochbauer. On film Wasner became the fictional Max Detweiler, who remained in Austria.

The real journey took the family first to Italy, where Georg attained citizenship due to his birthplace having become Italian territory in 1920, then on to London before boarding a ship for America. During the early 1940s they toured the U.S. as the Trapp Family Singers, eventually settling in Stowe, Vermont. There they opened a guest house, which is still owned and operated by descendants of the von Trapp family.",mainstream,M0e117,big.foot
989,"In most cases, your doctor can diagnose a plantar wart with one or more of these techniques:
• Paring the lesion with a scalpel and checking for signs of dark, pinpoint dots — tiny clotted blood vessels
• Removing a small section of the lesion (shave biopsy) and sending it to a laboratory for analysis

Most plantar warts are harmless and go away without treatment, though it may take a year or two. If your warts are painful or spreading, you may want to try treating them with over-the-counter (nonprescription) medications or home remedies. You may need many repeated treatments before the warts go away, and they may return later.

If your self-care approaches haven't helped, talk with your doctor about these treatments:
• None Stronger peeling medicine (salicylic acid). Prescription-strength wart medications with salicylic acid work by removing layers of a wart a little bit at a time. They may also stimulate your immune system's ability to fight the wart. Your doctor will likely suggest you apply the medicine regularly at home, followed by occasional office visits.
• None Freezing medicine (cryotherapy). Cryotherapy done at a doctor's office involves applying liquid nitrogen to the wart, either with a spray or a cotton swab. This method can be painful, so your doctor may numb the area first. The chemical causes a blister to form around your wart, and the dead tissue sloughs off within a week or so. Cryotherapy may also stimulate your immune system to fight viral warts. You may need to return to the doctor's office for repeat treatments every two to four weeks until the wart disappears. Some studies suggest that cryotherapy combined with salicylic acid treatment is more effective than just cryotherapy, but further study is needed.

If salicylic acid and freezing medicine don't work, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following treatments:
• Other acids. Your doctor shaves the surface of the wart and applies trichloroacetic acid with a wooden toothpick. You'll need to return to the doctor's office for repeat treatments every week or so. Side effects include burning and stinging. Between visits, you may be asked to apply salicylic acid to the wart.
• Immune therapy. This method uses medications or solutions to stimulate your immune system to fight viral warts. Your doctor may inject your warts with a foreign substance (antigen) or apply a solution or cream to the warts.
• Minor surgery. Your doctor cuts away the wart or destroys it by using an electric needle (electrodesiccation and curettage). This procedure can be painful, so your doctor will numb your skin first. Because surgery has a risk of scarring, this method usually isn't used to treat plantar warts unless other treatments have failed.
• Laser treatment. Pulsed-dye laser treatment burns closed (cauterizes) tiny blood vessels. The infected tissue eventually dies, and the wart falls off. This method requires repeat treatments every three to four weeks. The evidence for the effectiveness of this method is limited, and it can cause pain and potentially scarring.
• Vaccine. HPV vaccine has been used with success to treat warts even though this vaccine is not specifically targeted toward the wart virus that causes the majority of plantar warts.

Many people have removed warts with these self-care tips:
• Peeling medicine (salicylic acid). Nonprescription wart removal products are available as a patch or liquid. Usually, you're instructed to wash the site, soak it in warm water, and gently remove the top layer of softened skin with a pumice stone or emery board. Then after the skin has dried, you apply the solution or patch. Patches are usually changed every 24 to 48 hours. Liquid applications are generally used daily. You may need repeated applications on a regular basis over several weeks to months to see results.
• Freezing medicine (cryotherapy). Nonprescription medicines that freeze the wart include Compound W Freeze Off and Dr. Scholl's Freeze Away. The Food and Drug Administration cautions that some wart removers are flammable and shouldn't be used around fire, flame, heat sources (such as curling irons) and lit cigarettes.
• Duct tape. Using duct tape to remove warts is a harmless but unproven approach. To try it, cover the wart with silver duct tape, changing it every few days. Between applications, soak the wart and gently remove dead tissue with a pumice stone or emery board. Then leave the wart open to the air to dry for a few hours before covering it with tape again.

You'll likely start by seeing your primary care doctor. He or she may refer you to a specialist in disorders of the skin (dermatologist) or feet (podiatrist). The following tips can help you prepare for your appointment.

What you can do

Bring a list of all medications you take regularly — including over-the-counter (nonprescription) medications and dietary supplements — and the daily dosage of each.

You may also want to list questions for your doctor, such as:
• If I have a plantar wart, can I start with at-home care?
• If I proceed with home treatment, under what conditions should I call you?
• If the first treatment doesn't work, what will we try next?
• If the lesion isn't a plantar wart, what tests do you need to do?
• How long will it take to get results?

What to expect from your doctor

Your doctor may ask you questions such as:
• When did the lesion first appear?
• Has it changed in size or appearance?
• Have you had warts before?
• Do you have diabetes or poor sensation in your feet?
• Do you have any condition or take any medication that has weakened your ability to fight disease (immune response)?
• Have you tried any home remedies? If so, how long have you used them and have they helped?
• Do you use a swimming pool or locker room — places that can harbor wart-causing viruses?

What you can do in the meantime

If you're sure you have a plantar wart, you may try over-the-counter remedies or alternative medicine approaches. But talk with your doctor before trying self-care treatments if you have:

503,"The liger is a hybrid offspring of a male lion (Panthera leo) and a female tiger (Panthera tigris). The liger has parents in the same genus but of different species. The liger is distinct from the similar hybrid called the tigon, and is the largest of all known extant felines.[1][2] They enjoy swimming, which is a characteristic of tigers, and are very sociable like lions. Notably, ligers typically grow larger than either parent species, unlike tigons.[1][2][3]

The history of lion-tiger hybrids dates to at least the early 19th century in India. In 1798, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772–1844) made a colour plate of the offspring of a lion and a tiger. The portmanteau ""liger"" was coined by the 1930s.[4]

In 1825, G. B. Whittaker made an engraving of liger cubs born in 1824.[3] The parents and their three liger offspring are also depicted with their trainer in a 19th-century painting in the naïve style.

Two liger cubs born in 1837 were exhibited to King William IV and to his successor Queen Victoria. On 14 December 1900 and on 31 May 1901, Carl Hagenbeck wrote to zoologist James Cossar Ewart with details and photographs of ligers born at the Hagenbeck's Tierpark in Hamburg in 1897.

In Animal Life and the World of Nature (1902–1903), A. H. Bryden described Hagenbeck's ""lion-tiger"" hybrids:

It has remained for one of the most enterprising collectors and naturalists of our time, Mr. Carl Hagenbeck, not only to breed but to bring successfully to a healthy maturity, specimens of this rare alliance between those two great and formidable Felidae, the lion and tiger. The illustrations will indicate sufficiently how fortunate Mr. Hagenbeck has been in his efforts to produce these hybrids. The oldest and biggest of the animals shown is a hybrid born on the 11th May 1897. This fine beast, now more than five years old, equals and even excels in his proportions a well-grown lion, measuring as he does from nose tip to tail 10 ft 2 inches in length, and standing only three inches less than 4 ft at the shoulder. A good big lion will weigh about 400 lb [...] the hybrid in question, weighing as it does no less than 467 lb, is certainly the superior of the most well-grown lions, whether wild-bred or born in a menagerie. This animal shows faint striping and mottling, and, in its characteristics, exhibits strong traces of both its parents. It has a somewhat lion-like head, and the tail is more like that of a lion than of a tiger. On the other hand, it has no trace of mane. It is a huge and very powerful beast.[5]

In 1935, four ligers from two litters were reared in the Zoological Gardens of Bloemfontein, South Africa. Three of them, a male and two females, were still living in 1953. The male weighed 340 kg (750 lb) and stood a foot and a half (45 cm) taller than a full grown male lion at the shoulder.

Although ligers are more commonly found than tigons today, in At Home in the Zoo (1961), Gerald Iles wrote ""For the record I must say that I have never seen a liger, a hybrid obtained by crossing a lion with a tigress. They seem to be even rarer than tigons.""[6]

The liger is often believed to represent the largest known cat in the world.[1] Males reach a total length of 3 to 3.6 m (9.8 to 11.8 ft),[7][8] which means that they rival even large male lions and tigers in length.[9] Imprinted genes may be a factor contributing to the large size of ligers.[10] These are genes that may or may not be expressed on the parent they are inherited from, and that occasionally play a role in issues of hybrid growth. For example, in some dog breed crosses, genes that are expressed only when maternally-inherited cause the young to grow larger than is typical for either parent breed. This growth is not seen in the paternal breeds, as such genes are normally ""counteracted"" by genes inherited from the female of the appropriate breed.[11]

Other big cat hybrids can reach similar sizes; the litigon, a rare hybrid of a male lion and a female tigon, is roughly the same size as the liger, with a male named Cubanacan (at the Alipore Zoo in India) reaching 363 kg (800 lb).[12] The extreme rarity of these second-generation hybrids may make it difficult to ascertain whether they are larger or smaller, on average, than the liger.

It is wrongly believed that ligers continue to grow throughout their lives due to hormonal issues.[13] It may be that they simply grow far more during their growing years and take longer to reach their full adult size. Further growth in shoulder height and body length is not seen in ligers over six years old, as in both lions and tigers. Male ligers also have the same levels of testosterone on average as an adult male lion, yet are azoospermic in accordance with Haldane's rule. In addition, female ligers may also attain great size, weighing approximately 320 kg (705 lb) and reaching 3.05 m (10 ft) long on average, and are often fertile. In contrast, pumapards (hybrids between pumas and leopards) tend to exhibit dwarfism.

Ligers are about the same size as the prehistoric Smilodon populator and American lion.

Hercules, the largest non-obese liger, is recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest living cat on Earth, weighing 418.2 kg (922 lb).[14][15] Hercules was featured on the Today Show, Good Morning America, Anderson Cooper 360, Inside Edition, and in a Maxim article in 2005, when he was only three years old and already weighed 408.25 kg (900 lb).

The Valley of the Kings Animal Sanctuary in Wisconsin had a male liger named Nook who weighed over 550 kg (1,213 lb).[2][16]

To compare, the records for the lion and tiger in captivity are under 1,100 pounds (500 kg).[17][18]

Shasta, a ligress (female liger) was born at the Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City on 14 May 1948 and died in 1972 at age 24.[19] Nook died in 2007, at 21 years old.[2][16] Hobbs, a male liger at the Sierra Safari Zoo in Reno, Nevada, lived to almost 15 years of age before succumbing to liver failure and weighed 450 kg (992 lb).[20] This liger was born in 1943 and died in 1960. South Africa has two ligers at its zoo at Bloemfontein.[21]

The fertility of hybrid big cat females is well documented across a number of different hybrids. This is in accordance with Haldane's rule: in hybrids of animals whose sex is determined by sex chromosomes, if one sex is absent, rare or sterile, it is the heterogametic sex (the one with two different sex chromosomes e.g. X and Y).[clarification needed]

According to Wild Cats of the World (1975) by C. A. W. Guggisberg, ligers and tigons were long thought to be sterile; however, in 1943, a fifteen-year-old hybrid between a lion and an 'Island' tiger was successfully mated with a lion at the Munich Hellabrunn Zoo. The female cub, though of delicate health, was raised to adulthood.[22]

In September 2012, the Russian Novosibirsk Zoo announced the birth of a ""liliger"", which is the offspring of a liger mother and a lion father. The cub was named Kiara.[23]

Ligers have a tiger-like striped pattern that is very faint upon a lionesque tawny background. In addition, they may inherit rosettes from the lion parent (lion cubs are rosetted and some adults retain faint markings). These markings may be black, dark brown or sandy. The background color may be correspondingly tawny, sandy or golden. In common with tigers, their underparts are pale. The actual pattern and color depend on which subspecies the parents were and on how the genes interact in the offspring.

White tigers have been crossed with lions to produce ""white"" (actually pale golden) ligers. In theory, white tigers could be crossed with white lions to produce white, very pale or even stripeless ligers. There are no black ligers. Very few melanistic tigers have ever been recorded, most being due to excessive markings (pseudo-melanism or abundism) rather than true melanism; no reports of black lions have ever been substantiated. As blue or Maltese tigers probably no longer exist, gray or blue ligers are exceedingly improbable. It is not impossible for a liger to be white, but it is very rare.

Keeping the two species separate has been standard procedure.[citation needed] However, ligers have occurred, and do occur, by accident in captivity. Several AZA zoos are reported to have ligers.[citation needed] The USA holds the greatest population of around 30 ligers. China holds about 20 ligers. There are a few countries worldwide that hold a few, but probably less than 100 exist worldwide. [24]

As with the tigon, the liger exists only in captivity. Historically, the Asiatic lion and the Bengal tiger co-occurred in some Asian countries, and there are legends of male lions mating with tigresses in the wilderness, or of ligers existing there.[3]

The Caspian tiger co-occurred with the lion in places like northern Iran and eastern Anatolia (Turkey).[25]

In December 2013, the first white ligers were born at Myrtle Beach Safari in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to a white male lion and a white female tiger.[26]

They develop when the joint formed by the metatarsal and proximal phalanx bones of the big toe fall out of their normal, relatively straight alignment and angle out, creating an outward bulge at the base of the big toe. The bursa that cushions the joint may also get inflamed and enlarge. Often the end of the metatarsal bone becomes larger and misshapen.

Causes. Some people have a natural tendency to develop bunions because the big toe's metatarsal bone is splayed out to begin with. Wear-and-tear and being overweight can splay it out even further. Lack of an arch and overpronation (walking on the inside of your foot) put more weight on the big toe and its metatarsal-phalangeal joint. Jamming feet into narrow shoes puts backward pressure on the big toe, so it buckles out, forming a bunion.

415,"Sia’s video trilogy, “Chandelier”, Elastic Heart”, and “Big Girls Cry”, all feature the young dancer Maddie Ziegler performing elaborate choreography. A deeper look at the symbolism in these videos reveals the disturbing story of a young girl’s abuse inside the elite’s system of mind control.



While she only obtained mainstream success in 2014, Sia has been hard at work in the music industry for years. In addition to her own six studio albums, Sia has written hit songs for the world’s biggest pop stars including Beyonce, Rihanna, Britney Spears and Rita Ora. If you’re a reader of Vigilant Citizen, you already know that ALL of these artists have been mentioned on this site because they have all been used to push the elite’s Agenda at some point or another in their careers. Sia is, therefore, not a stranger to the higher ups of the music industry and the messages it wants to perpetuate.

The imagery associated with Sia’s sixth album 1000 Forms of Fear is right in line with the elite’s ongoing Agenda, which includes the sexualization of children, the normalization of ritual abuse, and the promotion of mind control. While these are strong words to describe videos of a young girl dancing while wearing a wig, the plethora of symbols surrounding the video trilogy strongly points in that direction.

The album cover features the blond wig worn by Sia and Maddie Ziegler.

This blond wig represents the concept of alter persona. The creation of alter personas is the main goal of Monarch mind control (if you don’t know what I am referring to, read this article first) and, coincidentally, products of Beta Kitten programming are often made to wear blond wigs. In the videos, this wig is worn by Maddie Ziegler, who is a typical child star raised by a twisted industry.

Maddie Ziegler began dancing at the age of 2 and, at age 8, appeared on Dance Moms, a “reality TV” show that I will never watch because it would probably cause me severe nausea and intense chest pain. I have come across a few screenshots from the show and … they gave me severe nausea and intense chest pain. The show is one is yet another excuse to dress young girls in slutty outfits and putting them on TV.

Ziegler has also appeared in a few Disney TV shows (the ultimate launch pad of screw up child stars). Today, at age 12, things are getting out of hand.

Maddie Ziegler is yet another example of a child star who grew up in an industry ruled by sick people who prey on the innocence of children. Sia’s videos symbolically describe the dark side of this entire system. Let’s look at the videos.

If one listens to Chandelier without watching the video, it appears to be about a girl who parties and gets drunk in order to keep sadness and desperation at bay.

Some parts of the lyrics indicate that the “one for a good time call” might actually be in the “pleasure for men” industry. She “parties” (works) all night, but she actually feels miserable. She gets wasted to become blind to the truth and numb from the pain.

However, at the end of the night, the sun sheds light on the harshness of her reality.

While the song might have heavy implications that can be interpreted in several ways, the video adds an even more disturbing dimension by featuring a 12-year-old girl in a skin-colored spandex suit dancing ecstatically to it. The video plunges the song into the dark world of mind control, where abandoned children deal with trauma, abuse, and multiple personalities.

The video features Maddie Ziegler dancing inside a grimy and abandoned apartment with strange drawings (apparently drawn by her) hanging on the wall.

The video ends with a shot of Maddie standing in the doorway while the image blurs, making it appear as if she is wearing nothing (I won’t even post a screenshot of this). This probably pleased child lovers watching the video. Elastic Heart goes even further.

Featuring a near-naked Shia Labeouf wrestling with Maddie Ziegler inside a cage, the Elastic Heart video sparked some mass media controversy due to its pedophile undertones. This even prompted Sia to apologize on Twitter.

It is interesting that Sia “anticipated” the “cries”, but went with it anyway. This is not the kind of subject to take lightly, especially considering the fact that countless people have been traumatized by it.

It is also interesting that Sia felt that Shia Labeouf was the only dancer who plays that role in her video. As I stated my article What is Happening to Shia Labeouf, Shia has been involved, in several ways, in the disturbing world of MK, including growing up as Disney child star. Recently, he was the star of the video Fjögur Píanó, which was clearly about Monarch programming (see my article about it here) and over the past years, he has displayed the kind of erratic behavior that is typical of MK slaves. In an interview with Interview Magazine, Shia described the difficult relationship with his father by using terms that can also be applied to mind control handlers.

So, yes, I suppose Shia is the right person to play a role in a trilogy that revolves around mind control. Is Shia playing the role of his own manipulative father in the video? Is he a predatory abuser? Do the dancers represent warring states in Sia’s head? Maybe all of the above.

Maddie reacts to the “advances” (for lack of a better word) by acting like an animal, biting Shia’s hand and roaring at him, as if she knew what was coming. However, Maddie warms up to Shia and gets close to him. Sometimes children don’t know the boundary between love and abuse.

This video featuring two lost souls in a strange setting with disturbing undertones ends sadly.

While it is difficult to exactly pinpoint what went on in Elastic Heart, the Big Girls Cry video is obvious … for those “in the know”.

While the song is about “big girls” being heartbroken, the video features a little girl for three and a half minutes. During that time, the girl played again by Maggie Ziegler, performs all kinds of facial expressions that end up telling a story. And, she does indeed mimic the abuse and trauma suffered by an MK slave. When one understands what this is truly about, the video is actually quite clear, even blatant.

The video ends with the final product of the traumatizing and dehumanizing process of mind control.

Sia’s video trilogy tells a story that is dark and disturbing. It will, however, remain a mystery to most viewers because most of them say “Wow, that’s so creative and artistic” without truly understanding what it is about. The videos all star Maddie Ziegler, a child performer that is sadly becoming another face of the mass media’s obsession with child exploitation.

Each video in the trilogy describes a different aspect of mind control, creating a disturbing narrative. Chandelier depicts a child that was visibly abandoned in a disgusting place, surrounded with images alluding her alter persona; Elastic Heart portrays a conflictual relationship with some kind of father figure with an underlying theme of child abuse and Big Girls Cry sums up the process of mind control using hand gestures and expressive faces.

While this imagery is absorbed by the viewers, powerful music plays in the background, causing an emotional connection with what is happening. In the end, the videos serve the ultimate purpose of the elite’s entertainment industry: To normalize their sick obsessions (child abuse, exploitation and mind control) and to make them part of popular culture. While the masses dance to songs they don’t truly understand, the true victims of the system are still ignored by the public as they are locked into a powerful system and subjected to …1,000 forms of fear.",conspiracy,C03380,big.foot; george.bush; mind.control
398,"Canadian officials are investigating after a human foot washed up on the shores of British Columbia – marking the 13th time in the past decade that tides have carried a sneaker-clad foot on to its coastline.

The grisly find was made earlier this month by Mike Johns as he walked his dog along the scenic southern coast of Vancouver Island. After a large object tangled in sea kelp captured the dog’s attention, Johns leaned in for a closer look.

What he saw was a fibula and tibia attached to a left foot, all of it encased in a white sock and black Velcro shoe. “By the looks of it, the foot was totally intact. The ankle bone still worked and the bones were attached at the base of the knee,” Johns told CTV News.

After calling police, Johns carried the foot home for safekeeping, worried that high tides might wash the foot back into the ocean or that it would attract the attention of wildlife in the area.

The find was the latest in a series that has sparked speculation around the world. Since 2007, another dozen feet have washed up in British Columbia, each of them clad in running shoes.

Some point to natural disasters, such as the 2004 tsunami, or plane or boat accidents at sea. Others theorise that the feet might be the work of a serial killer or organised crime.

At times pranksters have also sought to add fuel to the fire. “We’ve had people put dog foot skeletons in runners and leave them on the beach,” Barb McLintock of the BC coroner’s office told the Guardian the last time a foot washed up, in February 2016. “And somebody even used old chicken bones.”

In the past dozen cases, the provincial coroner’s office has ruled out foul play, noting that none of the feet showed signs of trauma. They have identified eight of the feet, saying they included two pairs, and determined that the remaining lone feet belonged to men.

All of the individuals either killed themselves or died accidentally, with their feet naturally coming apart from their bodies during decomposition, said the coroner.

The ubiquitous presence of running shoes might explain some of the mystery. Made with light but durable materials, the shoes both protect the foot from decomposition and act as a flotation device that pulls it to the surface.

In the latest case, authorities are attempting to identify the foot and a cause of death. Police are scouring databases to see if there are any matches with missing persons cases and have said that foul play is not suspected at this point.



The investigation is in its early stages and could eventually be broadened, said Andy Watson of the BC coroner’s office. “It may even include working with agencies south of the border, because with the tides and the coastline this could have come from another jurisdiction too.”

Watson said he wasn’t sure why the number of feet found in British Columbia had climbed into double digits in recent years. “I don’t really have a succinct reason as to why that is,” he said. “You know, you look at the sheer nature of the geography and how big the coastline is.”",mainstream,M091ca,big.foot
1263,"A mother walking her dogs in a forest thought to be haunted was stunned when her pets suddenly stopped to stare at a 'creature' that some are claiming is Bigfoot.

Maxine Caulfield was strolling through an area known as Slieveanorra in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, when she claims her pets used their 'sixth sense' to seek out the figure among trees.

But it wasn't until she arrived home and uploaded the pictures that she and others noticed the spooky outline of what looked like a furry beast lurking in the woodland.

Ghost stories have been told about Slieveanorra since October 1942, when a US Air Force B17 Flying Fortress bomber crashed into a mountain there, killing eight of the ten people on board.

Mother-of-one Ms Caulfield, 49, said: 'I haven't got a clue what it is but when I saw it, it really freaked me out. It's not like anything I've ever seen before.

'The dogs are normally full of energy and never stop running but when we went through that part of the forest the just stopped still and stared in the same direction.

'It was as if they knew something was there. I couldn't see anything at the time but when I got home and showed people the pictures it was spooky.

'People were pointing out its face and saying it was Bigfoot. I've always been pretty open-minded about the paranormal.

'I don't disbelieve, and this has really reinforced my view that there could be something out there.

'The dogs were playing away in the snow but my German Shepherd's ears pricked up when she went through this section. It wasn't normal.

'When you zoom in it really does look the body of a beast. Along with all the other history and rumours about the place, it really makes you think.'

Ms Caulfield has also discovered a mysterious wooden cross planted in the forest with the date 31/03/76 inscribed on it.

She walks her dogs - German Shepherd, Roxy, and miniature schnauzer, Charlie - weekly through the forest, around seven miles from her home in Cloughmills.

Ms Caulfield said: 'I honestly didn't realise what was there at the time. I take a lot of pictures when I'm out with the dogs and this time I'm glad I did.

'I couldn't see what the dogs were looking at. I kept thinking: 'Is somebody coming? Am I safe out here on my own?'

'I put it out of my mind really and didn't think any more of it but it was only when I sat down and had a proper look at it that I thought it was a bit freaky.

'It's quite a remote area and it's got some history with old Irish clans too. There's a memorial to the air crash and I've found a wooden cross with a date engraved on it.

788,"Arthritis commonly attacks joints in the hands, knees, and hips, but it can occur in any part of the body where joints exist — including the toes. A number of different types of arthritis can cause toe pain. Sometimes the cartilage wears away between the bones. Without the protective cartilage, bones rub together. This inflames the tissue and causes pain and swelling. If you’re experiencing toe pain, read on to find out if arthritis may be the cause.

Toe arthritis is caused by inflammation of the toe joint. The disease most often attacks the big toe, but the others may be affected as well. Past injuries or traumas, such as a broken or sprained toe, can cause arthritis down the road. Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout may also be to blame. Women who wear tight, high-heeled shoes for much of their lives may also be at risk for toe arthritis.

Pain is most likely the first noticeable symptom of arthritis. You may feel a general pain in the toes or only the big toe. People describe it as ranging from a deep, achy feeling to a sharper, stabbing sensation when they try to move. It may be minor, moderate, or severe depending on the level of deterioration or inflammation in the joint. Pain is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms of arthritis. It can stop you from enjoying your normal daily activities.

Over time, arthritis wears away at the cartilage between joints, inflames tissues, and damages synovial fluid. All these changes can make joints stiff and difficult to move. With less cushioning and support, joints become resistant to bending and stretching. This can result in difficulty walking, as the toes play a big part in balance and in pushing the foot off the ground. It may hurt when you try to walk because the toe joint moves with every step.

All types of arthritis cause inflammation in the joint, which can result in visible swelling. The toes may turn red and feel warm to the touch. You may notice this symptom after you have been sitting for a while, or after you get out of bed. Swelling can also make it difficult to put your shoes on in the morning. They may feel tight until you walk around a while and the swelling goes down.

You know how it sounds when you crack your knuckles? You may start to hear similar sounds in your toes if you have arthritis. A grinding noise is a fairly common symptom as well. These sounds are caused by the deterioration of the cartilage that typically cushions the two bones in a joint. As that cartilage wears away, the bones may rub against one another, causing these sounds. If bone spurs develop, they can also cause clicks and cracks.

Does your toe look bigger than it used to? Is it starting to rotate away from your foot? These occurrences can be symptoms of toe arthritis. As the cartilage wears away and the bone grinds against bone, the body attempts to make the situation better. Its solution is to create more bone. Although this may stabilize the joint, it can also make it appear larger, or like it has a big bump on it, not unlike the appearance of having bunions. It may send the toe off in a new direction, creating a curved shape or what is sometimes called “claw feet.”

When inflammation brings more blood to your toes, you may feel a sense of warmth or heat in the area. It can be mildly irritating, but it usually doesn’t interfere with your daily activities. You may also see redness on the skin around the joints, and they may become tender to the touch.

A locked joint can happen when there is so much swelling and stiffness that the joint is no longer able to bend at all. Rough edges on the bones and bone spurs can also cause a joint to lock up. It may feel like the toe is stuck, and it can be painful. This is usually not a permanent condition. You may have to walk around for a while, or try to manipulate the toe to bend again.",mainstream,M135ae,big.foot
994,"Internet TROLLS, also known as paid “forum posters”, “internet bloggers,” or if we call them what they really are, SHILLS, are increasingly being employed by private corporations and contracted agencies, sometimes for marketing purposes, but mostly to distract from the truth and prevent public outcry about dangerous programs such as geoengineering, genetically modified foods, and any issue where profiteers put their bottom line and lust for control over the destruction of the planet and at the expense of our health. Trolls are employees that answered a work at home job ad on craigslist or some other venue.

The geoengineering trolls, specifically, are employed by the two main disinformation sites, metaxxxx and contrailxxxxxxx, both run by a gaming programmer.

He and his band of hired internet trolls lack expertise in science, meteorology or any other field related to geoengineering, yet claim to be experts in atmospheric science, and fancy themselves “debunkers”. Shillidiocy is a term that best describes the rapidly growing industry of people ready and willing to sell out humanity for a few pennies per comment. Disinformation has been used throughout history for political purposes and these strategies are being utilized today by these paid internet trolls.

(Psychological Warfare – discredit, distract, intimidate, frustrate, divide & conquer) – Disinformation shills often make outrageous comments for the sole purpose of deflecting focus from the truth to distract us by creating a “controversial debate” where none truly exists. Often, trolls use the “Trojan Horse” method to attempt to elicit an emotional response from people online, to evoke hostility with the intent of twisting it around to make the person look volatile, a classic “character assassination” tactic to discredit them, making them appear weak. On some occasions, they intentionally keep pushing a person into a heated argument, and will go so far as to “report” the person as being a “threat” to try to get them kicked off of the forum. Another major character assassination tactic is to highlight any negative or perceived flaw of an otherwise reputable person, whether true or false, to intentionally discredit them in an attempt to invalidate their viewpoint and make them seem baseless, to detract focus from the information they are sharing. The trolls often “make stuff up” if they can’t find anything real to highlight for this goal, after all, shills are paid liars. Another trick these liars are taught is to use semantics to twist people’s words around and make it seem as though they’ve lied, to discredit them. These are all character assassination tactics that you will easily recognize happening all over the internet once you become familiar with them.

Disinformation shills sometimes pose as a supporter of the truth, or “friendly folks on the fence” politely asking simple questions, in a sly attempt to later discredit the movement. Often trolls posing as friendly allies will resort to posting long, incoherent diatribes (usually on fake blogs & articles) for the purpose of associating the movement with insanity; or other times to act as a “the voice of reason” and create a debate (where none exists) to make it appear as though the data isn’t strong enough, and they offer to play “devil’s advocate” to “help the movement”, then render any and all data as invalid regardless of how legitimate the source. They will “demand proof” then ignore it when it’s presented, or continue to demand impossible proofs. Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in public forums, they will deem the material irrelevant and demand unattainable proof that is virtually impossible for the opponent to retrieve; for the purpose of detracting focus from the mounds of legitimate data available for those of us that take the time to do some real research beyond the disinformation site links.

Trolls often interject themselves into productive web discussions in order to make themselves appear credible as though they have a “real” argument, where none actually exists. Their job is to create controversy and instigate a “debate”. They scour the net and attack awareness videos, articles, blogs, public facebook pages, etc., posting links from metaxxxx or conxxxxxscience, but fail to post legitimate links with verifiable references. They relentlessly keep commenting on a thread to dominate the discussion with the intent to keep their comments at the very top. They also vote their comments up and everyone else’s comments down, (if the forum offers that feature). This is evident when you become familiar with their methods. I have yet to see a disinformation shill post a reputable link, or ANY link, other than from those two disinformation sites. In addition, they adamantly refuse to look at real data. They intentionally divert attention from credible documentation, dismissing it without examination. They regurgitate the same tired harassing insults, and repetitive generic jargon about how water vapor condensation trails are formed, which has nothing to do with the persistent, spreading, lingering trails we often see covering the sky that is being done as “scientific research”, the prelude to fully implementing global geoengineering programs.

Trolls are supplied with a list or database with preplanned talking points and a format designed as generalized and deceptive responses to honest arguments. Geoengineering (chemtrails) “debunker” trolls are notorious for this, and note they never actually “debunk” anything. All they do is deflect from the truth to try to cast doubt and keep the denial tactic going so the profiteers of geoengineering can continue to suppress public outcry in order to keep spraying us without us balking and rising up to stop them. If you pay close attention and track the trolls, you will see that they often post the same comments over and over on many different threads.

This works hand in hand with #1 (character assassination), and the “Trojan Horse” troll. The goal is to sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule, engaging them in a hostile argument to try to discredit them, also known as the “attack the messenger” ploy. The goal of “false association” is to associate opponents with unpopular titles such as “paranoid conspiracy theorist” to make them look crazy and try to discredit them, or call them derogatory names such as “chemtard”, “ignorant”, or “liar”, attempting to invalidate anything they say regardless of how true it is. The trolls seek to deliberately associate the movement with far fetched concepts like “Big Foot”, aliens, false flag conspiracy theories, etc., because of the inherent negative connotations, (tying in with “character assassination”). The ultimate goal is to provoke argument, create biases, and dissuade people from objectively examining any evidence presented.

Pretending to be the “voice of reason” in an argument with obvious and defined sides in an attempt to move people away from what is clearly true, into the murky waters of “doubt” where the truth becomes “relative.” And if that doesn’t work they will antagonize and goad opponents with insults, name calling, and bullying. If they can’t do anything else, they will chide and taunt their opponents and draw them into emotional responses with the goal of making them look foolish or mentally unbalanced, in hopes of rendering their point invalid merely by shifting focus to show how “sensitive they are to criticism”, in an attempt to deflect from their point and invalidate any data they are presenting. This is why it’s best to ignore their taunting.

A very common technique is that the troll will accuse his opposition of subscribing to a certain point of view, even if he does not, will make it appear so, then attack that point of view (Straw Man). Or, the troll will put words in the mouth of his opposition, and then rebut those specific words. He will use conjecture, ridicule, and accusation to try and prove himself as valid while discrediting others with absolutely nothing, shouting “you have no argument, that is just ad hominem”, which is ironically, exactly what he is doing. The troll is trained to appear confident, unwavering, and that he is undoubtedly right, when in reality, it’s the exact opposite. Basically, he is a paid liar and his goal is to create doubt and discredit the truth.

When the internet shill realizes people are aware of his tactics, he will try to play nice, act innocent, and pose a seemingly “harmless” leading question.

William01702, used tactic #s 6, 8, and 2 to troll the video (link below) of the courageous Kristen Meghan, who stands strong to do what is right in the face of adversity to warn people about geoengineering and the disinformation sites. If you watch the video and listen to her, it is clear what is happening with the rampant disinformation in our mainstream; PAID shills are ready and willing to contribute to the demise of our world, and sell out their humanity to perpetuate lies for a measly buck. The shill “Hama Neggs” also trolled it with some derogatory comments about Kristen Meghan using #1 (character assassination). These troll’s comments may, or may not, get deleted by the page moderator; but if they remain, notice the date and how quickly they found it. It’s their job to scour the net and attack, so in time, even if theirs get deleted, more paid trolls will appear. If you check other awareness videos, you’ll see the same usernames in action repetitively. Save LI Forum – 09 – Kristen Meghan – Geo-engineering

The following bold, italic quotes are actual troll comments made by username William01702 who is known to routinely attack youtube geoengineering awareness videos.

“Could you please tell me what “disinformation” you have found on Metabunk or contrailscience? I mean, you claim the information isn’t factual, and then provide no evidence to support such a claim. Why?”… “It really is a legitimate question which deserves an answer. Despite what paranoid liars like GalileoGalileisGhost say.”

 (If William01702 was just a random viewer, why would he care whether those sites have been exposed as disinformation, and “demand proof”, unless he IS an associate (a paid shill)? The answer becomes evident if you notice how he followed with the classic “false association” & “Trojan Horse” tactic to disparage shill buster, GalileoGalileisGhost. Would a random user that’s not associated with those disinformation sites have cause to do this)?

William01702 – on a different thread: (note the contrast when confronted for his shill activity):

“ I’m not a troll I’m just someone who is better educated in atmospheric science and aviation than all chemtards, combined.”

 (notice his derogatory use of the word “CHEMTARDS” a classic Trojan Horse move).

William01702:

 

 “Chemtards couldn’t be more stupid if they wanted to be. You people are evil alarmists who spread fear, hate, and ignorance based on a lack of education. I pity the chemtards!”

 (does that sound like someone educated in atmospheric sciences or anything else for that matter)?

William01702 wrote this on an entirely different thread:

“Oh really and where do they say that THIS trail has ANYTHING to do with what they have “admitted to”. NO WHERE! It’s hilarious that you people read about some basic testing and then assume everything you see in the sky must be related to such testing. Chemtards are idiots! Oh, and BTW show me where anyone has admitted to any such thing! If you say HR2977 you’re a fucking moron!”

William01702 wrote this on yet another thread (verbatim, spelling errors & all):

“Tat should have read “because you are too stupid and lazy to understand basic fucking science”. But, does it matter?! Will it change anything?! No, you will always assume that just because you hate/fear the government that it must mean that you and your chemtard friends must be right about the trails in the sky. Nevermind the fact that you have never actually studed these subjects! You have visited conspiracy sites! You know it all real pilots are just STUPID for going to school for years!”

William01702 on yet another thread:

“Poor chemtards unable to understand he difference between an intentional nefarious release of chemicals and business as usual”.

William01702 and yet another thread:

“Why do you people pretend to understand that minor differences in temperature, engine power settings, engine types, and engine size can result in differences in trails, when its obvious that you are all fucking clueless!!! This video isn’t evidence of anything more than the ignorance of chemtards”!

William01702 on a video about chemical fallout from geoengineering (notice the pattern from the previous comments):

“Yup, I’m sure that she is a moron. And so are you. There is ZERO evidence that this “affliction” has ANYTHING to do with the trails in the sky. NONE! It’s nothing more than paranoid fantasy made up by those who like to pick at their skin. And you are right, she IS just one moron in a line of many. By the way accepting ignorant bullshit from OTHER paranoid losers on the internet is NOT “research”.”

William01702 wrote these comments on various videos as well:



“Stupid chemtards”, “Idiot”, “Moron”, AND “that is technology that is not only public knowledge, but is highly regulated. It also has nothing to do with any trails in the sky. That’s the problem with you people. You are completely ignorant but are too stupid to know it”!

Compare the subsequent comments with the name calling & insults, to the first one that was on a video where his disinformation sites were brought to light and notice how he tried to recover by looking innocent & friendly despite his hostility and antagonistic comments on other awareness videos.

Who are these trolls that have time to sit around and make comments on youtube all day and night, and WHY target awareness videos? The answer is clear, they are SHILLS. I took photos of the comment pages in the likely event that this loathsome user attempts to attack this blog and denies ever making those comments. So, unless he deletes all of his comments from all the youtube awareness videos he has attacked, and closes his account, (let’s hope he does), you can plainly see his existing comments (and more) on youtube by checking his page activity or tracking him on awareness videos. Just remember not to let the trolls bait you. They get PAID to antagonize you and LURE you to those disinformation sites.

It is apparent that some of these shills share usernames and have round the clock shifts because no one is online that often to target that many awareness videos without backup. William01702 is joined by known shills such as Hama Neggs (a particularly loathsome troll), Lizoir, Terry Ram, Nwoflyer, epsilon892, Niglet Gook, Belfrey1, Jazzaconda,Baba Loo, MrFubar75, and several other usernames that have been identified as paid shills/trolls, all utilizing the same tactics and associated with the two known disinformation sites, employed by gaming programmer, the grand daddy of them all, Mick We$t, (or at least that’s the name he “goes by”). Their format is always the same and they often attack in teams to “back each other up”. Anyone that does a little digging will find these same usernames frequently darkening awareness videos all over youtube, regurgitating insults, performing their usual antagonistic, tactical routine, and attempting to lure people over to their disinformation sites because they get compensated for it.

Less frequently, you’ll see these strategies mimicked by average people in the mainstream that have willfully succumbed to cognitive dissonance and easily fallen prey to the disinformation tactics that have been used on them. They seem happy to regurgitate the lies they have been told and are content to post links only from those disinformation sites, while refusing to look at any other credible data presented to them. It’s like a mass Stockholm Syndrome in which their limited intellects are easily held hostage by their disinformation captors, and they’ve fallen “in love” with Mick We$t and his band of marauding minions. These victims of mass brainwashing also exhibit the common trait among trolls, of refusing to examine credible, verifiable, REAL data (such as several scholarly documents that can be found through this link:http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=geoengineering+modeling+studies&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart&sa=X&ei=e-q_UcHDCMjPiwLk4YEY&ved=0CC0QgQMwAA).

Sadly, people’s refusal to examine any data beyond the disinformation sites, means success for the disinformation campaign. Getting the public to do their bidding, not only meets the goal of “divide and conquer” in the battle to pit us against each other, it keeps us distracted, engaged in their fictitious debate, and prevents us from focusing on the fact that heavy metals such as aluminum, barium, and strontium, and other toxic chemicals such as sulphuric acid, and silver iodide, are being sprayed into our air supply globally for the purpose of Weather Modification and Climate Engineering. In this war on awareness, the truth becomes irrelevant, and the sleepwalkers, happy to remain blissfully ignorant, are proud to belong to the band of trolls that have, ironically, convinced them that we are the “ignorant” ones, and that they are the geniuses that have all the answers.

The telltale difference between mass cognitive dissonance and a paid internet troll, is that the trolls usually have obscure usernames, no profile pic (or a generic one) and if you track their previous comments on other threads, you will see that they have attacked using the same format over and over; in addition to attempting to lure people to the disinformation sites, where they get compensated to engage them in a futile “debate”, waste people’s time and distract them from spending time increasing awareness in their local community, and doing REAL research ongeoengineering.

Don’t let the trolls cause you to feel stupid for considering that geoengineering may be a reality and suppress your awareness. Keep watching the sky and research information beyond the fixed mainstream search engines. Watch the documentaries, Look Up! and What in the World are They Spraying?, take notes and look up the information presented. The TRUTH is there for anyone that is intelligent enough to look past the deceit & lies.

WHAT YOU CAN DO TO AVOID THE TROLLS

1) Never “reply to” them; (do not fall for their tactics).

2) REPORT them, because what they’re doing is a form of cyber-BULLYING.

3) On your page, DELETE their comments and BLOCK them.

Share this information to increase awareness and disempower their lies.

636,"A rare, multispecies brawl unfolded recently in the deep ocean off the coast of Hawaii. In one corner, an oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) — a 7-foot-long (2.1 meters) predator capable of diving up to 1,000 feet (300 m) below the surface in pursuit of prey. In the other corner… it's not clear. But whatever it was, it was huge, it had tentacles and it put up a hell of a fight.

Undersea photographer Deron Verbeck caught the aftermath of this mysterious scrap when he snapped a picture of the offending shark, scarred all along its flank with strange circular patterns and dots. According to a study published June 3 in the Journal of Fish Biology, there are only a handful of creatures in Hawaiian waters capable of creating scars like that, and they are all enormous cephalopods.

While it's impossible to be sure what exactly scarred the shark, the researchers argue that it could have been a ""phantom of the deep"" — another name for the elusive giant squid (Architeuthis dux).

Related: Giant squid filmed alive for second time in history. Here's the video.

Giant squids are mysterious denizens of the deep ocean, thought to be able to grow anywhere from 33 to 43 feet (10 to 13 m) in length. They are poorly studied because they live so deep underwater — typically about 1,000 feet (300 m) down or more, the researchers wrote. Their deep dwellings put the giant squids not only out of reach of most humans, but also many would-be predators.

The oceanic whitetip shark may be an exception, the researchers wrote. Because the sharks are known to dive to extreme depths on foraging missions, it's feasible that an unlucky whitetip could find itself snoot-to-sucker with a giant squid.

That may be what happened to the scarred shark in the photo. According to the researchers, the series of circular marks along the shark's back and side are shaped exactly like the suckers on a large squid's tentacles. From the size of the markings, the offending squid must have been at least the same size as the shark (at least 7 feet, or 2 meters, long) and was possibly even larger, the researchers wrote.

Only three types of squids known to inhabit Hawaiian waters could have created the marks, the team concluded: a squid in the genus Thysanoteuthis or Megalocranchia (both known to grow up to nearly 7 feet) or the giant squid.

Many other details of the encounter remain a mystery. For example, who threw the first punch? (Or bite? Or slap?) According to the researchers, this is the first time such large tentacle markings have been observed on a shark, so it's hard to say whether the shark was acting in offense or defense. However, ""the lack of any obvious wounding suggests they were more likely defensive (i.e. the shark attacked the cephalopod),"" the researchers wrote in the study. ""Similar scarring patterns are seen on sperm whales, well-known predators of large cephalopods.""

When pressed for details on the encounter, the shark responded merely: ""You should see the other guy.""",mainstream,M0fb07,big.foot
277,"With the round-the-clock British media coverage of the royal family in the days leading up to the big day for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, it would be hard not to conclude that this year's wedding of weddings is a source of delight for every Briton.

But not everyone in Britain remains as excited as the thousands already crowding into Windsor to claim a spot that will allow them to grab a glimpse of the wedding couple and the pomp and circumstance. Social media was littered with all kinds of memes deriding the wedding ceremony.

Oscar-winning British actress Emma Thompson chimed in, telling a TV interviewer: ""There's not a single thought about it in my head to share with you.""

And some viewers are expressing frustration with the incessant focus on the wedding — on the preparations, who's coming and not, what the couple will wear and what they will eat. The BBC Breakfast show incurred the wrath of some for its all-consuming focus on the royal wedding and its constant and breathless updates.

On Twitter some viewers grumbled: ""Non-stop coverage of the #RoyalWedding on @BBCBreakfast this morning. Thankfully, there's no other news happening at all,"" one wrote. Another remarked: ""REPORT SOME ACTUAL BL***Y NEWS #bbcbreakfast #RoyalWedding.""

The activist anti-monarchy group Republic, which wants the monarchy abolished and replaced with an elected head of state, demanded on its website Friday that the BBC and other British channels stop celebrating the royal wedding and report in a balanced way.

""The monarchy is a contentious issue. It provides us with a head of state and lies at the heart of our constitution. This issue must be treated by broadcasters as politics, not entertainment,"" said Graham Smith of Republic. ""The BBC has willfully ignored a string of stories that might put a different complexion on the wedding story. They continue to celebrate and promote the monarchy, not simply report on it.""

Republic said BBC News had largely ignored stories about the removal of homeless people from streets in Windsor and ""widespread criticism"" of how much money the British taxpayer will have to pay for the wedding. It pointed to a poll conducted by YouGov this week that suggested nearly a third of the British public would like to see the monarchy abolished.

The poll showed the Scottish as the least likely to like the queen or care about the future of the monarchy, with key findings showing that north of the border with England fewer than half of Scots approve of the queen and most believe that Britain's lawmakers should swear allegiance to the country and not the monarch. Three-quarters of Scots told the pollsters they were not interested in Saturday's wedding.

Royal critics have highlighted the bad news for the monarchy in the poll. But overall the royal family and the institution of the nonarchy remains popular, with 68 percent of the British public believing the institution is good for the country.

The poll coincided with an important landmark for the queen, who is now the longest-serving monarch in British history, overtaking Queen Victoria's reign of 63 years, seven months and two days.

Despite the mounting criticism during the week of the public costs of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's big day, the royal family tried to disarm possible criticism early by announcing that they would meet the costs of the wedding itself. But because they also receive money from taxpayers, it was unclear how much of their private money would defray the costs.

And British taxpayers will still have to foot a huge bill to cover the security and municipal costs. Thames Valley police will be providing most of the security in Windsor. The last royal wedding in 2011 between Prince William and Kate Middleton cost nearly $8.7 million, according to Britain's Press Association.

Some commentators said the costs should be lower this time because the wedding is being held outside London, reducing logistical challenges. British minsters declined to comment on spending related to the royal wedding, saying no information would be released before the event.

But Britain's Independent newspaper reported Friday that the cost of the big event would be much higher than previously thought. Wedding planning service Bridebook said the wedding itself would most likely cost $43 million. And some security analysts estimated the security bill at $40 million — a big jump from the 2011 royal wedding because of heightened threat levels in Britain following a string of terror attacks over the past 18 months.

British ministers say any public money used for the wedding is money well spent, arguing the event will encourage more tourists — especially Americans — to visit Britain. But no evidence was supplied by the government to show that that was the case in 2011.

""These royal weddings epitomize the British monarchy's fondness for reverse Robin Hood economics, whereby wealth is redistributed from ordinary people, via their taxes, to a fabulously rich family that on such occasions appears not very modern, at all; in fact, it all feels rather feudal,"" said Patrick Basham, the founding director of the Democracy Institute, a Washington- and London-based libertarian think tank.

He told VOA: ""A royal family savvier about the optics would have refused, for example, taxpayers footing the vast security bill. Instead, wedding sponsorship would have been procured from the British fashion, music and tourism industries, which would serve to get taxpayers off the hook — a huge PR win — and provide significant global branding opportunities for leading domestic companies and entrepreneurs.""",mainstream,M0ec78,big.foot
1236,"There's no doubt that there's been a rise in the popularity of marathons and their accompanying half-marathons—especially in recent years.﻿﻿ But if you believe these events are reserved for elite athletes, think again. There’s a marathon for everyone—from people who just want to have a good time to those seeking an obstacle course. And don't forget those who are checking races off their bucket lists.

These long-distance runs are so expensive, time-consuming, and in-demand that companies are spending money on races either for the prestige and the advertising of a permanent corporate sponsorship, or just to get a simple, lucrative return on investment. But just what are the economics behind marathons? And where does all that money go? Read on to find out more about the costs associated with these races.

The Dollars and Cents of Running a Marathon

Marathons are a relatively inelastic good, so even if the cost to participate goes up, people still take part. And they're normally willing to shell out a lot of cash for the experience. Some of the elite races charge participants different fees from selection lotteries to registration costs. And these charges can be quite hefty. The bigger the race, the bigger the cost.

Let's look at the New York City Marathon—one of the world's most coveted races. Prospective participants have to meet certain eligibility criteria before they can be guaranteed entry. The organization holds a selection lottery just for a chance to participate in the actual marathon. Then there's the registration fee, which depends on your status. U.S. residents who are members of the New York Road Runners group pay a $255 registration fee. That fee increases to $295 for residents who are nonmembers, and to $358 for non-U.S. residents.﻿﻿

The costs of putting on a marathon begin to accumulate months before the race actually happens. First, the organizer has to examine a map and decide where to hold the race. Armed with a meticulously planned-out route, the organizer needs to get the necessary permits from the city and permission to use quasi-public spaces and any private property like parking lots.

Once the permits are secure, the organizer needs to consult a USA Track & Field Road Course Certifier about having the distance certified.﻿﻿ After all, no one wants to be that person who holds a 25-mile marathon by mistake. The road course certifier charges a small fee for these services.

Finally, it’s time to start getting the word out to the public. Advertising costs can drop dramatically if social media picks up the race. But even still, organizers will still have to budget for radio, print, and online ad space.

Race day is the most expensive part of a marathon. Not only does the course need to be set up with water tables, food tables, and portable toilets, it all needs to be done by people. If no one volunteers, the event organizer needs to hire and pay its staff for the day.

Staffing expenses come on top of the cost of having an on-site medical team in case of an emergency. This is an important requirement set forth by the insurance policy the race organizer will also need to buy. And let's not forget the immense cost of security to ensure crowd control. According to a Philadelphia half-marathon, the cost to secure a half-marathon with a simple police presence can range between $30,000 and $120,000.﻿﻿

The racers who have paid a hefty registration fee to run are also an expensive part of the race. According to the Washington Post, participation t-shirts, bibs, pins, goodie bags, and medals cost the Marine Corps Marathon about $13 per person in 2013.﻿﻿ Smaller races would have a higher cost per person as they can’t benefit as much from economies of scale.

Race timing systems are perhaps the biggest hidden cost to the racers. Usually consisting of a cheap radio frequency identification (RFID) attached to a race bib, a timing system can cost thousands. Hiring a company to time a smaller event can be cheaper in the short term, with machine and chip rentals costing a few dollars per runner.﻿﻿

The biggest source of revenue for marathons is the entry participation fee. For races organized as charitable fundraisers, high registration fees aren’t a large concern as the runner knows that any excess will go to help fight breast cancer or to build a new school track field. Races run in the name of a charity can attract big sponsors who want to give back to the community and benefit from supporting a good cause. The Washington Post broke down the cost of hosting a marathon and found that for every $99 a runner paid to participate, sponsors contributed $58.﻿﻿

Corporations are incentivized to organize running events and prestigious marathons because of their popularity. As with all goods, the more popular and in-demand it is, the more an organization can charge. Realistically, the Boston Marathon, London Marathon, and New York City Marathon could double their prices, and although there would be an outrage, their limited good (racing spots) would be filled by people who value the experience enough to pay the inflated costs.

Some of the world's biggest marathons attract people from all over the world. That means big bucks for local economies. For example, roughly 30% of the drawing applicants accepted to run in the 2020 New York City Marathon were international runners.﻿﻿ Runners who come from outside the hosting metropolitan area inject a lot of money into hotels, food, and entertainment.

All of this is true for other less prestigious but uber-popular races. Some popular examples include the Rock n Roll Marathon and Walt Disney’s (DIS) Walt Disney World Marathon, as well as Color Me Rad, Tough Mudder, and other running events. Races that belong to the latter category also have the financial benefit of being untimed, which leads to more money for the organizer as well as the city itself.

731,"You know it's going to be a bad day when you find yourself falling through the air without a parachute! But let's say that, somehow, you were to fall out of an airplane and found yourself in that exact situation.

You have to keep that you have to think fast. If you fall out at 12,000 feet (about 2 miles up), you only have about 60 seconds before you hit the ground. In free fall, you fall at about 125 miles per hour (mph) if you have your arms and legs extended, and at that speed you will travel about 12,000 feet in one minute.

The first thing to do is to look for a body of water. If you can dive into water, it won't feel good at 125mph, but you'll survive if the water is deep enough -- at least 12 feet or so. Steer toward the water (it's helpful if you've been skydiving before and know how to steer as you are falling), and dive right in.

If there's no water around, then you need to try something else. One person in World War II survived a jump without a parachute from about 18,000 feet. He fell through the branches in a pine thicket and landed in deep snow. So you might try looking for some trees and hope for the best.

Lacking water or trees -- for example, you're falling in an urban area and can't spot a rooftop pool -- your next option is to look for something big with the hope that it will break your fall. For example, landing on the roof of an RV, a mobile home or a truck's trailer is a possibility.

These structures are not extremely strong. When you hit them, they'll break and absorb some of the energy of the fall. Whether it will be enough energy or not is an open question. There's only one way to find out, but we don't recommend you try it! And while we do like to do our own research and take things apart here at HowStuffWorks, you have to draw the line somewhere. This is definitely a line.­

542,"CAIRO (Reuters) – The Democratic Republic of Congo’s squad have apologised to their compatriots for unexpectedly losing their opening game of the Africa Cup of Nations to underrated Uganda on Saturday.

Both skipper Youssouf Mulumbu, who did not play in the 2-0 defeat, and Chancel Mbemba, who wore the captain’s armband in the game, said sorry in a recorded message that was distributed on Twitter (@Leopard Leader Foot).

“We come to you, simply to apologise. It’s true that it’s difficult, but we have to,” said Mulumbu, flanked by coach Florent Ibenge and with his team mate standing behind him.

“We need unity and it’s true that today we let you down. I hope it’s a good lesson for us. We still have two games to play, we need your support and we will correct the situation very quickly.

“Today, we made a big mistake, I know it’s humiliating for the 90-million Congolese. That’s why we come back to you with sincerity and with hand on heart to apologise.”

Mbemba also expressed the same sentiments in his brief statement.

The Congolese conceded both goals at set pieces — first from a corner and then a free kick as Patrick Kaddu and Emmanuel Okwi scored in Uganda’s first win at the finals for more than 40 years.

It has since emerged that the Congolese had to cancel their last training session on the eve of Saturday’s match because squad members were forced to undertake medical checks at a Cairo hospital as the country’s football federation had not supplied the required health certificates to tournament organisers.

They now face an uphill battle to advance past the first round. They will face hosts Egypt on Wednesday before taking on Zimbabwe next Sunday in their last Group A game.",mainstream,M0c884,big.foot
174,"Believe it or not, your feet are a good barometer of your overall health. From a pesky foot pain to more serious symptoms like numbness, your feet often show symptoms of disease before any other part of your body.

No hair on your feet or toes

“Bald” feet can be a sign of poor circulation as a result of vascular disease. What can you do? Although the hair may never return (which isn’t necessarily a terrible thing!), you’ll want to see a doctor about improving your circulation and getting your vascular health in check.

If you have a wound on your foot that just won’t heal, you could be at risk for diabetes. Elevated blood glucose levels over time can lead to nerve damage in the feet, and so you may not feel an ulcer on your the bottom of your foot. Left untreated, this can lead to serious consequences, even to amputation.

For women, cold feet may indicate an “underfunctioning” thyroid problem, which is the gland that regulates temperature and metabolism. Poor circulation is another possible cause for both men and women. The solution: Aside from potential thyroid medications, there’s not much you can do other than bundle up your feet in thick wool socks and slippers to keep warm.

If one or more of your toenails starts to thicken, change color, and separate from the skin, it probably means you have a fungal infection living beneath the toenail. People with diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and other immune deficiencies may be more susceptible than others in contracting toenail fungus.The solution: See a podiatrist or internist for care and treatment.

If your big toe suddenly blows up, you may be experiencing gout. This medieval sounding disease is actually a form of arthritis and is caused by the build up of the natural substance, uric acid. Why the big toe? The excess uric acid forms in the body part with the lowest temperature, which just happens to be your big toe.

Having a persistent “pins and needles” feeling in your feet, or actual loss of feeling, can be a sign of peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy means there’s been some damage to your peripheral nervous system and can be caused by several things, but the most common are diabetes and alcohol abuse. The solution: See your doctor and explain your symptoms.

The skin condition psoriasis can also manifest itself in your toenails. Affecting up to half of those living with psoriasis may find their toenails (and fingernails) to have many tiny holes. People with the related joint condition, psoriatic arthritis, also may experience this issue.The solution: There are currently several medications on the market to treat the symptoms associated with psoriasis and psoriatic psoriasis.

A shooting pain in your heel may be a sign of plantar fasciitis, which means the band of connective tissue running along the bottom of your foot is inflamed. The pain is usually concentrated in the heel and gets worse throughout the day.The solution: If you have persistant pain, see a podiatrist and avoid high heeled shoes.

Sunken toenails could be a sign of anemia. Anemia often shows up in toenails with as concave or spoonlike indentations in the toes’ nail beds, and is most prevalent in moderate-to-severe cases. To be sure, your doctor will want to do a complete blood count.

Sudden, one-off instances of foot cramping may just mean you’re dehydrated or exercising too hard, but if you have chronic foot cramping, you may be lacking calcium, potassium, or magnesium in your diet. If you experience frequent cramping, try stretching your feet before bed and eating more calcium-rich foods.

Sore toe joints may be a sign of the degenerative joint disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA typically attacks smaller joints first – like joints in the wrist and toes, so pay attention if you have a persistent achy feeling or swelling.

The inability to raise the foot upward from the heel is called “drop foot.” This could be the result of nerve damage or trauma in your neck, back, or leg. If you experience this, you should contact your doctor immediately, since this can be reversed or permanent, depending on what caused it and how it’s treated.

Dry, flaky skin on the feet could be a sign of athlete’s foot, which is a fungal infection. Athlete’s foot usually shows up between the first two toes and usually starts as dry, itchy skin that then progresses to inflammation and blisters. If you suspect you have athlete’s foot, be sure to keep your feet clean and dry.

Toes that show a variation of color – from white, to blue, to red – may be experiencing a symptom of Raynaud’s disease. The colors appear as the vessels spasm. If you experience this, see a doctor to make sure there isn’t an underlying condition.",conspiracy,C036ab,big.foot

Quick, how much money would you say there is in hunting Bigfoot?

That’s at least according to the Wednesday morning assessment of Tom Biscardi’s Bigfoot Project Investments Inc by FactSet, a data provider that tracks publicly traded companies. Biscardi’s company had, at that time, a market capitalization of more than $10 billion.

“I gotta tell you something, I nearly s—.” That’s Biscardi describing his first Bigfoot encounter to CNBC. He says he’s personally seen the cryptid seven times in 45 years, starting in Northern California in 1973. Biscardi’s initial encounter sparked a series of videos and a website that refers to him, perhaps inaccurately (medically speaking, at least) as “the Godfather of Bigfoot.”

Biscardi’s company (stock ticker: BGFT) was registered in 2013 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It’s currently what’s known as a “pink sheets firm,” which means it’s in the same category as penny stocks, shell corporations and other less-than-savory investments.

In filings with the SEC, BGFT says its stock became eligible for trading on June 28. This week, the current share price was $50.01, which, with number of shares in the company outstanding (200 million), created the $10 billion figure.

The thing is, no one understands where that $50.01 figure came from, because, as CNBC reports, BGFT’s current assets are “$221 in cash along with 73 original casts of Bigfoot footprints, a 109-inch skeleton and a rubber suit from a 2008 Bigfoot hoax.” (Filings also note that Bigfoot is known by 15 names across the world, such as “Yeti” in Tibet, “Yowie” in Australia and “Hibagon” in Japan. The more you know.) Biscardi does not collect a salary.

Called by CNBC, Biscardi was unaware of his company’s value. “Wow, that’s a lot of money,” he said. “If I was worth $10.4 billion, I’d do like that guy Trump and I’d run for president.” (Or maybe hire Megan Fox?)

The valuation quickly disappeared under scrutiny, as OTC Markets made a “courtesy call” to its data vendor after CNBC called them. (Perhaps BGFT should relocate to Idaho, where “Bigfoot” is among the most-searched Google terms.)

Still, Biscardi remains optimistic. “I think it will be a helluva market to reckon with down the line, ’cause we’re going to be doing very well,” he said. “Could you imagine if we brought back one of these creatures?” he said. “Think about it.”",mainstream,M07c69,big.foot
411,"One of the perplexing aspects about the 9/11/01 attacks in the United States concerns the official story that the Pentagon was targeted by “terrorists,” and struck by a commercial jet American Airlines Flight 77, a Boeing 757. We know it was AA Flight 77 because of this convenient piece of “wreckage” recovered at the site:

One of our sources sent over a video, purportedly from a Pentagon security camera facing the impact site. The frame paused at 5 seconds appears to show a fast-moving projectile slamming into one side of the Pentagon from the right. This object has no wings whatsoever. The logical conclusion is that the object is a missile.

After the impact, a fireball quickly becomes thick, gray smoke. At 1:49 the video cuts to some live-action footage of the Pentagon. This footage was shot from a position opposite from the first film, but still facing the point of impact.

However, the first people on the scene who weren’t first responders (police, firefighters, medics) found no evidence that a plane actually struck the Pentagon. The wreckage did not make “forensic sense,” and raised questions immediately from objective witnesses.

The female CNN reporter begins this video by saying that a certain “Bob Franken and an eyewitness” had concluded that the plane landed “short of the Pentagon” – meaning it never made it that far.

The entire CNN breaking news segment, which includes the above video content, is shown in another YouTube video. CNN’s military affairs correspondent Jaime McIntyre said no plane even fell short of the mark. After walking up to the smoldering Pentagon, he observed:

“From my close-up inspection, there’s no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon…The only pieces left…are small enough to pick up in your hand. There are no large tail sections, wing sections, fuselage – nothing like that anywhere around which would indicate that the entire plane crashed into the side of the Pentagon and then caused the side to collapse.”

The demolished Pentagon floors didn’t collapse until 45 minutes after impact, and the burn marks were inconsistent with those seen at the WTC Twin Towers in NYC – also allegedly toppled by mere airplanes.

By the way, in terms of construction physics, the heat generated by the amount of jet fuel on a plane (based on fuel tank capacity, rate of consumption, and time from take-off) is not hot enough to “melt steel,” as the mainstream media repeated ad nauseum.

The damage seen at the Pentagon crash site is more consistent with that of a plane crash – but was there even a plane? Many investigators say the answer is no.

This video analyzes the damage done to the Pentagon. The affected area measured about 65 feet wide and 73 feet tall – the height of the building. The narrator informs:

“From wingtip to wingtip, a 757 is 124 feet, 10 inches. From nose to tail a 757 is 155 feet 3 inches in length, and the height is 44 feet 6 inches. How does a plane of those dimensions [size] fit into a hole only 65 feet across?”

Just to recap, we have first-hand reports that no significant plane wreckage was found at the Pentagon explosion site and the hole was too small to have been made by a 757 jet airplane. Both reports were buried while the mainstream media continued to bleat the cover story in order to launch the unending “War on Terror” under which we are currently oppressed.

Is there more evidence to weigh?

Try this on for size. This video reported that NO ONE DIED right after this alleged jet crashed into a busy office building during working hours. Just how is that supposed to happen, given the physical forces involved? Were the people shown being transported on stretchers actually paid, professional crisis actors?

Apparently, Bush, Cheney, and the other NWO leaders in charge of the US believed – and still believe – that We the People are dumb as stumps. We swallowed their incredibly evil lies and let them take away our civil rights under the oxymoronic Patriot Act.

Most people – or “sheeple” – who are either too busy or just not interested do believe that giving up our cherished freedoms is “the price we must pay” to ensure “national security.”

Occasionally, though, someone important admits the truth.

In this short video snippet from an interview with Neil Degrasse Tyson, former President Bill Clinton mentions the “Pentagon bomb.” Although lifted from its original context, Clinton seems to be answering a question about 9/11 being an inside job that was discussed by the US presidential candidates during the debates – before anything happened on 9/11.

A slip of the tongue? A guilty conscience? A mistake made while tired? You decide.

Now, consider this eye-witness testimony. A woman alleging to be a Pentagon employee inside the building during the explosion on 9/11 made this video. At 2:19, she says:

“As I was coming out of the Pentagon I didn’t see any evidence of metal, airplane seats, luggage – nothing that would give me any indication that it was a plane that had hit the building.” No one she encountered had any jet fuel on their bodies, and no one in her area.

This concerned citizen’s call to action is to open a federal grand jury to decide if We the People are the victims of highest-level perjury and obstruction of justice.

The “official story” is BUNK, plain and simple. Stop the fictional “War on Terror” forced on a nation still reeling from shock. Dismantle the pork-belly, boondoggle organizations thereby created, notably DHS and TSA.

Refocus the national narrative on the truth, and for pete’s sake, stop patronizing us.

We taxpayers funded the ridiculous “9/11 Commission Report” which concluded that the guilty party was – are you ready for this? – the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

Even 9/11 Commissioner Tim Roemer spilled the beans when he told CNN, thinking back about the Pentagon attack:

“You were worried, especially when I was standing in front of the Pentagon that night, seeing one of our fortresses pried open by a missile – uh, airplane.”

49,"Oarfish are large, greatly elongated, pelagic lampriform fish belonging to the small family Regalecidae.[1] Found in all temperate to tropical oceans yet rarely seen, the oarfish family contains three species in two genera. One of these, the giant oarfish (Regalecus glesne), is the longest bony fish alive, growing up to 8 m (26 ft) in length.

The common name oarfish is thought to be in reference either to their highly compressed and elongated bodies, or to the now discredited belief that the fish ""row"" themselves through the water with their pelvic fins.[2] The family name Regalecidae is derived from the Latin regalis, meaning ""royal"". The occasional beachings of oarfish after storms, and their habit of lingering at the surface when sick or dying, make oarfish a probable source of many sea serpent tales.

Although the larger species are considered game fish and are fished commercially to a minor extent, oarfish are rarely caught alive; their flesh is not well regarded for eating due to its gelatinous consistency.[3]

The dorsal fin originates from above the (relatively large) eyes and runs the entire length of the fish. Of the approximately 400 dorsal fin rays, the first 10 to 13 are elongated to varying degrees, forming a trailing crest embellished with reddish spots and flaps of skin at the ray tips. The pelvic fins are similarly elongated and adorned, reduced to one to five rays each. The pectoral fins are greatly reduced and situated low on the body. The anal fin is completely absent and the caudal fin may be reduced or absent, as well, with the body tapering to a fine point. All fins lack true spines. At least one account, from researchers in New Zealand, described the oarfish as giving off ""electric shocks"" when touched.[2]

Like other members of its order, the oarfish has a small yet highly protrusible oblique mouth with no visible teeth. The body is scaleless and the skin is covered with easily abraded, silvery guanine. In the streamer fish (Agrostichthys parkeri), the skin is clad with hard tubercles. All species lack gas bladders and the number of gill rakers is variable.

Oarfish coloration is also variable; the flanks are commonly covered with irregular bluish to blackish streaks, black dots, and squiggles. These markings quickly fade following death.

The giant oarfish is by far the largest member of the family at a published total length of 8 m (26 ft)—with unconfirmed reports of 11 m (36 ft) and 17 m (56 ft)[4][5][6] specimens—and 270 kg (600 lb) in weight.[7] The streamer fish is known to reach 3 m (10 ft) in length,[8] while the largest recorded specimen of Regalecus russelii measured 5.4 m (18 ft).[9]

Oarfish have the longest known length of any living species of bony fish.[10]

The oarfish is thought to inhabit the epipelagic to mesopelagic ocean layers, ranging from 200 meters (660 ft) to 1,000 meters (3,300 ft) and is rarely seen on the surface. A few have been found still barely alive, but usually if one floats to the surface, it dies. At the depths the oarfish live, there are few or no currents. As a result, they build little muscle mass and they cannot survive in shallower turbulent water.[11]

The members of the family are known to have a worldwide range. However, human encounters with live oarfish are rare, and distribution information is collated from records of oarfish caught or washed ashore.[2]

Oarfish were first described in 1772.[12] Rare encounters with divers and accidental catches have supplied what little is known of oarfish ethology (behavior) and ecology. Oarfish are solitary animals and may frequent significant depths up to 1,000 m (3,300 ft).

An oarfish measuring 3.3 m (11 ft) and 63.5 kg (140 lb) was reported to have been caught in February 2003 using a fishing rod baited with squid at Skinningrove, United Kingdom.[13]

A photograph on display in bars, restaurants, guesthouses and markets around Laos and Thailand captioned ""Queen of Nāgas seized by the American Army at Mekhong River, Laos Military Base, on June 27, 1973, with the length of 7.80 metres [25.6 ft]"" is, as far as the caption goes, a hoax. The photograph itself is real, however, and was taken by Dr. Leo Smith of the Field Museum, of an oarfish found in September 1996 by United States Navy SEAL trainees on the coast of Coronado, California, USA.[14][15]

In 2001, an oarfish was filmed alive in situ: the 1.5-metre (4.9-foot) fish was spotted by a group of U.S. Navy personnel during the inspection of a buoy in the Bahamas.[16] The oarfish was observed to propel itself by an amiiform mode of swimming; that is, rhythmically undulating the dorsal fin while keeping the body itself straight. Perhaps indicating a feeding posture, oarfish have been observed swimming in a vertical orientation, with their long axis perpendicular to the ocean surface. In this posture, the downstreaming light would silhouette the oarfishes' prey, making them easier to spot.

In July 2008, scientists captured footage of the rare fish swimming in its natural habitat in the mesopelagic zone in the Gulf of Mexico. It is the first ever confirmed sighting of an oarfish at depth, as most specimens are discovered dying at the sea surface or washed ashore. The fish was estimated to be between five and ten metres (16 and 33 ft) in length.[17]

As part of the SERPENT Project, five observations of apparently healthy oarfish Regalecus glesne by remotely operated vehicles were reported from the northern Gulf of Mexico between 2008 and 2011 at depths within the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones.[18] These observations include the deepest verified record of R. glesne (463–492 m or 1,519–1,614 ft).[19]

From December 2009 to March 2010, unusual numbers of the slender oarfish Regalecus russelii[9] (竜宮の使い “Ryūgū-No-Tsukai”,) known in Japanese folklore as the Messenger from the Sea God's Palace, appeared in the waters and on the beaches of Japan, the appearance of which is said to portend earthquakes.[20] After the 2011 Fukushima earthquake and tsunami which killed over 20,000 people, many pointed to the oarfish from 2009–⁠2010 to build up this myth.[21]

In 2016, Animal Planet aired an episode of the television series River Monsters named ""Deep Sea Demon"" in which Jeremy Wade was filmed during an encounter with a live oarfish while diving. The oarfish at this location seemed to be using a buoy anchor chain as a guide to ascend to the surface. On his second diving attempt, he was able to film two live oarfish as they ascended relatively close to the surface. This is the only known footage of human interaction with a healthy oarfish in its own environment. Wade was even able to touch one of the oarfish with his hand. The oarfish were propelling themselves by an amiiform mode of swimming as noted by other sightings.[22]

In January 2019 two oarfish were found alive in the nets of fisherman on the Japanese island of Okinawa.[21]

Oarfish feed primarily on zooplankton, selectively straining tiny euphausiids, shrimp, and other crustaceans from the water. Small fish, jellyfish, and squid are also taken. Large open-ocean carnivores are all likely predators of oarfish.

The oceanodromous Regalecus glesne is recorded as spawning off Mexico from July to December; all species are presumed to not guard their eggs, and release brightly coloured, buoyant eggs, up to six millimetres (0.24 in) across, which are incorporated into the zooplankton. The eggs hatch after about three weeks into highly active larvae that feed on other zooplankton. The larvae have little resemblance to the adults, with long dorsal and pelvic fins and extensible mouths.[2] Larvae and juveniles have been observed drifting just below the surface. In contrast, adult oarfish are rarely seen at the surface when not sick or injured.

II. Discover Your Ethnic Descendance From the Shape of Your Feet

A study claims you can tell your heritage from the shape of your feet, so take a look and discover where your ancestors originally came from.

Skeptical? Then here are some facts that can help support the feet shape / roots relation.

Fact 1: Human genome determine several physical factors as skin, hair and eye color, shape of body and limbs, and so many more from baldness to disease tendencies.

Fact 3: There are other studies that revealed endemic tribal / family characteristics, like lack of fingerprints (adermatoglyphia) E.g.: in an outstanding number of Basque peoples.

Fact 4: We must consider mixed origins, since almost all races have mixed along the past 500 years. Very few and rare are the supposed “pure” lineages.

But that’s not all. There is more to discovering your ancestors origins.

According to author Jane Sheehan who wrote “Let’s read Our Feet” indicates more than your origin.

“It’s all about analyzing the structure and texture and imbalances of the feet to understand someone’s emotions and personality,” she says. “When you are angry, how do you walk? When you are happy, how do you walk? When you are depressed, how do you walk? Each of these emotions has it’s corresponding walk. Over time you can see their impact on the feet. “Of course, it’s not just about emotions – each of these walks also has a physiological aspect too. But I’m most interested in emotions and personality.”

Ms Sheehan offered this summary to the UK’s The Telegraph.

III. What Different Fingers Length Reveals About Your Personality

Did you know that the length of your fingers can reveal something about your personality!? Compare the length of the index finger and ring finger and see if it matches with some of your characteristics.

The image shows three types of finger lengths, marked A, B and C. Check your fingers and discover the meaning below.

A) They say that people in which the ring finger is longer than the index finger are very beautiful in appearance. They radiate with charm that others find irresistible. In addition, they are more aggressive and decisive and it is no problem for them to take a risk.

The profession they usually have is: soldier, engineer, chess player and they are also successful in solving crosswords. Scientists have discovered that people with longer ring fingers earn more than people with shorter ring fingers.

B) People with shorter ring fingers than the index fingers have a great deal of self-confidence, they are full of them self and arrogant. They enjoy solitude and do not like to be disturbed in their free time.

168,"A run-of-the-mill sasquatch story is spiced up — and aged down — by telling the tale not from the perspective of the creature himself, but from his human teenage son in “The Son of Bigfoot.” The animated adventure follows Adam (voiced by Pappy Faulkner) as he undergoes a transformation that is far more than just puberty.

This English-language Belgian production doesn’t feature quite the budget, visuals or imagination of its American blockbuster counterparts, but it will likely provide a fun 90-minute diversion for kids.

Adam is bullied at school, and he longs to know more about a father he never met. When he starts sprouting wild hair and his feet outgrow his shoes, he soon discovers that his father (Chris Parson) isn’t dead like he’s been told. Instead, he’s a sasquatch and has been hiding in the woods because evil corporation HairCo. wants to experiment on him in their quest to cure baldness.

The script misses the spark of better family films with its overly complicated plot and lackluster dialogue. However, “The Son of Bigfoot” features some nice animation, particularly in its action scenes, and its moments between father and son are especially sweet.

1115,"­It is amazing, but the total amount of gold in the world is a surprisingly small q­uantity. Here's how you can calculate the total amount that is available.

If you look at a page like this one, or if you look it up in an encyclopedia, you will find that the annual worldwide production of gold is something like 50 million troy ounces per year. Gold has a specific gravity of 19.3, meaning that it is 19.3 times heavier than water. So gold weighs 19.3 kilograms per liter. A liter is a cube that measures 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) on a side. There are 32.15 troy ounces in a kilogram. Therefore, the world produces a cube of gold that is about 4.3 meters (about 14 feet) on each side every year. In other words, all of the gold produced worldwide in one year could just about fit in the average person's living room!

This cube weighs 1,555,210 kilograms (3,110,420 pounds). A recent spot price for gold was $256.10 U.S. -- using that number, all of the gold produced in a year is worth $12,805,000,000. That's a lot of money, but not an unimaginable amount. For example, that's about how much the Pentagon spent launching the GPS satellite system. NASA's budget in 1998 was $13.6 billion.

Figuring out the total amount of gold that has been produced by man is a little harder. To get at some kind of estimate, let's figure that the world has been producing gold at 50 million ounces a year for 200 years. That number is probably a little high, but when you figure that the Aztecs and the Egyptians produced a fair amount of gold for a long time, it's probably not too far off. Fifty million ounces * 200 years = 10 billion ounces. Ten billion ounces of gold would fit into a cube roughly 25 meters (about 82 feet) on a side. Consider that the Washington Monument measures 55 feet by 55 feet at its base and is 555 feet tall (17 x 17 x 170 m). That means that if you could somehow gather every scrap of gold that man has ever mined into one place, you could only build about one-third of the Washington Monument.

Platinum is even more scarce than gold. Only 3.6 million troy ounces are produced per year. Its specific gravity is 21.45, and it was discovered in the 18th century, not in 3,000 B.C. If you assume that the world has produced 3.6 million ounces per year for 50 years to estimate the total worldwide supply, all of the platinum in the world would fit in a cube that is 6.3 meters (about 20 feet) on a side. In other words, all of the platinum in the entire world would easily fit in the average home!

365,"Okay. Lets begin having a look at some modern propaganda techniques. 

 

 

 On two separate occasions, someone mentioned something to me about terrorism, or the war on terror, and I responded by asking ""you do know that there is indisputable scientific evidence that proves beyond any doubt that the Twin Towers were demolished with explosives, right?"" For me, any discussion of terrorism has to begin with the understanding of what actually happened on 9-11, rather than what we were told to believe. 

 

 On both occasions, the person I was talking to responded by saying ""I heard that the president of Mexico saw a UFO."" 

 

 The first time this happened, I shook my head and thought to myself ""what the hell is this girl thinking? Maybe the president of Mexico sniffs glue and sees all kinds of things, but what does one thing have to do with the other? How did she make the jump from 9-11 to Mexican UFOs without a sentence between the two subjects? 

 

 The second time it happened I thought to myself ""Holy shit. This is a conditioned response."" Somehow, the herd has been taught to immediately make an association with UFOs, Bigfoot, or the ghost of Elvis whenever someone talks to them about crimes committed by people within our government. This is incredibly convenient for a government comprised of crooks and perverts, but how did they accomplish this?

 

 If you take a look at a typical ""conspiracy website"", youll see all kinds of revelations about the 9-11 attacks, the FEMA concentration camps, and possibly the latest information on that shadowy and elusive group known only as ""The New World Order,"" and youll also see the latest crop circle designs, the most recent UFO photos, the image of Christ in an ice cube, a first-hand account from the man who wrestled Bigfoot, the true location of the sunken city of Atlantis, and all manner of non-sense designed to make any important information appear ridiculous by this association. 

 

 The Daily Globe is one of two newspapers Im aware of that exists for this same purpose. This is one of the thin papers that usually sports a headline involving 800-pound Siamese twins suing each other for and against surgical separation, or the poor man whose wife was mysteriously transformed into a hammer-head shark. Because everyone knows that these newspapers epitomize incredulity, theyre the perfect place to print any information that needs to be immediately discredited. ""ALIEN ABDUCTEE SAYS U.S. GOVT BEHIND 9-11 ATTACKS"" would be a probable headline.

 

 See how this works? You dont have to buy the paper. Nobody does. A few copies are prominently displayed near every supermarket checkout line, and this is what people remember when someone tries to warn them that the government of this nation has gotten completely out of control. Their mind makes an association between the important information, and the ridiculous information, and they feel confident that its nothing they need to worry about, but they may carry on the silly conversation about UFOs and stuff just to be polite. Silently theyre convinced that because you tried to warn them about their criminal government, you must also spend your nights on the roof searching the skies for E.T.

 

 Theres also no shortage of TV and movie characters who openly insist that our government is involved in all kinds of heinous activity, but every last one of them is a lunatic. Cosmo Kramer is a recent example. He promotes alternative medicine, doesnt trust the government, and besides that, hes completely off the wall. Not the type of lunatic you would fear, but hes definitely not someone you would look to for reliable information, or even sane discourse. Look closely at every TV character who questions or mistrusts the government, and you will see that this behavior is linked with one abnormal personality after another. The sub-conscious lesson here is that anyone who questions the government or suggests they may be involved in any crime has an abnormal personality, so you can quickly dismiss everything he has to say. Through decades of repetition of these messages, youve been taught to ignore any criminality on the part of anyone in our government, and anyone who might make such an accusation. While you were being so trained, you were robbed of your wealth and freedom.

 

 There are people commonly referred to as ""conspiracy theorists"". In reality, absolutely no one hangs around theorizing about conspiracies, but this label is applied to anyone who feels a civic duty to warn other Americans of criminal activity within their government. The ""conspiracy theorist"" is a character that only exists on television and in movies, and this character, who is always a lunatic, was created for you to make an association with when someone tries to warn you about government crimes. The result is that when someone tries to explain to you that your own government is doing all it can to either kill or enslave you, he may as well be crying to you about his wife turning into a shark during his most recent UFO abduction, regardless of any proof he has.

 

 For most Americans, the people on TV have replaced their normal human society, and the exchange of ideas they would have once had with neighbors and others in their community is now fed to them via the almighty tube. They are fed two sides of a debate, allowed to choose between them, and this choice allows them to feel a bond with other people of one opinion or the other, and lets them feel like theyre wise enough to have an opinion in the matter, and free enough to express it. The reality here is that neither side of the debate ever contains the entire truth of the matter, but just enough information, or misinformation, to make them feel theyre informed, and give them something to enter a futile debate with, if they did actually talk to their neighbor. Political correctness silenced the rest of them by teaching a reluctance to saying or hearing anything controversial or possibly disturbing.

 

 What Americans are shown on TV are allegedly the products of various independent broadcasting companies who compete for viewers who will supposedly watch the commercial messages that are injected into the entertainment, but if this is the case, why the incredible similarity between the allegedly competing companies? Wouldnt you think that eventually one network or Hollywood studio might experiment with a sane and respectable character who doesnt trust the government?

 

 Are there any other typified characters that exist on all networks? As it happens, there are many. Just to name a few; every father is an idiot, as is every private citizen who owns a firearm, every mother is an over-worked and under-appreciated slave, everyone who works for the government is a hero who endlessly risks his life for your protection, and everyone who sells drugs is black or hispanic. Every Arab is a screaming madman, and every Jew is kind, gentle and wise. Every homosexual is moral, kind, and intelligent, and everyone who lives in a rural area of the country is an idiot. I dont need to go on. You can probably name a few of your own, but the important point here is that the same personality traits transcend all characters on all networks. This is obviously no accident.

 If we can see common themes and messages that are being foisted upon the public by all networks, it proves that either there is no real competition between them and they all share a common political goal, or that all of their programing is being influenced or dictated by an outside entity, or both. Nothing else can explain the incredible similarity of stereotyped personality traits in all these fictional characters.

 

 Now the next logical step would be to recognize and list as many of these common themes as possible, and see if they all serve a particular political agenda. Just by skimming the surface we see an effort to thwart private gun ownership, discourage masculinity, encourage homosexuality, promote women to ""head of household"" status, and foster hatred against all Arabs. Then there are the constant attacks on that ""antiquated document"" known as the Bill of Rights, which permeate every episode of ""Law and Order"" and ""CSI"" ** (if not for that silly forth amendment, all those mangled children would be alive, kind of thing).

 

 Whose interests does this propaganda serve? Who benefits by trying to shape public opinion in this direction? Certainly not the TV viewer, because as well see in the next episode of our action-packed adventure through main-stream media propaganda, the TV viewers been taught to work against his own self-interests.

1099,"By the time you reach your 50th birthday, you've prob-ably also reached another milestone: you've put 75,000 miles on your feet. You may reach this milestone much earlier if you've led a foot-active lifestyle. By age 50, you may have lost nearly half of the fatty padding on the soles of your feet. And you may be wearing a shoe that's a size bigger than what you wore in your 20s, in part because of weight gain that puts greater pres-sure on your feet, and in part because your ligaments and tendons have lost some of their elasticity (which also predisposes them to potentially painful ruptures or microtears). If you've given birth, you have another reason for the increase in shoe size: hormones released during pregnancy also cause ligaments to relax.

Menopause, too, can affect foot health. Unless countered by medications or exercise, the loss of estrogen and other hormonal changes generally lead to lower bone density, resulting in osteoporosis if enough bone mass is lost. This condition can raise the risk of stress fractures (hairline breaks) in any of the bones of the foot. Unless treated appropriately, stress fractures can worsen and cause the bones to shift out of place.

1068,"Monos is set in a South American paradise but comes off like Lord of the Flies in hell. Following an eight-strong group of teen soldiers and their adult prisoner of war, it is sensual, and gorgeous and intensely, continuously disturbing. The kids – Dog, Lady, Bigfoot, Boom-Boom, Rambo, Swede, Wolf, Smurf – are left to their own devices except for the occasional visit from “the Messenger”, who works for whatever organisation has recruited them. So they scrap and kiss and fire their AK-47s into the sky.

Alejandro Landes, the film’s 39-year-old director, says it doesn’t matter who they’re fighting for. “Colombia’s been war-torn for so many decades. I’ve seen that violence happen from the left and I’ve seen it happen from the right. My grandfather’s favourite place in the world, his farm that he worked all his life to buy, became the headquarters for the most gruesome rightwing paramilitary group, the AUC, and I’ve had part of my family kidnapped by guerrillas.”

Who, exactly? “My grandfather’s sister, my cousin … things like that.” Were they freed? “Some yes, some no. So that is something that I had seen and experienced.” These experiences inspired and informed Monos.

We’re given no specifics of time and place – it’s somewhere in Latin America. Landes, who lives in New York, has Colombian roots but grew up in Ecuador, his parents having left Medellín in the 1980s to escape the violence. To find his actors, he and his producers sifted through 800 tapes, selecting 25 possibles totake part in a mock training camp for four weeks in the Andes. Most had never acted before, though there was one major exception: Moisés Arias (Bigfoot) was a regular in Miley Cyrus’s Disney series Hannah Montana. One they saw on a tape playing basketball, a kid with a close crop, referred to on the court as Matt, but in fact named Sofia (Buenaventura). She plays Rambo in the film and, says Landes, “was very inspirational for the fluidity of the character”. He calls the character, who is written as male, “post-gender”.

Researching the film, Landes visited Colombian reinsertion camps, meeting adult rebel fighters who had laid down their guns and wanted to enter civil society. In one he found Wilson Salazar, a man with dwarfism who became a child soldier at 11 and deserted when he was 24. There was a sizeable price on his head, dead or alive. “He was very good at what he did,” says Landes. “He had risen to be part of a column called Teófilo Forero, one of the most feared combat units. He was an amazing destroyer of things.”

Landes hired Salazar as a military consultant, then asked him to play the Messenger, too, as he was so convincing. At the camp, Salazar woke his young charges at 4am each day. They’d undertake acting exercises in the mornings, and in the afternoons Salazar would give them clandestine military training. “It was intense,” says Landes. “It was a boot-camp scenario – the kids were living, sleeping, eating together, everything together, all at the same time.” Landes then selected his eight, tweaking the screenplay to fit.

The shoot was yet more full-on. The opening mountaintop segment was shot at almost 14,000ft (4,300m): punishingly cold and wet. “You move slower up there,” says Landes. “There’s low oxygen, you move in a bit of a daze.” On the first day, someone from the camera department had an epileptic seizure. A baptism by fire, thought Landes; things will get easier. They did not. For four weeks, the 55-strong cast and crew filmed in the jungle around the Samaná river, five hours south-east of Medellín. Mules carried their food; Colombia’s national kayak team helped with filming on the rapids; a family of local gold miners built their military tents. There was no electricity, no running water, no refrigerated food and torrential downpours all night every night. There were food rations. The shoot took its toll.

“People were dropping like flies, including me,” says Landes. “Everyone had their day. Everyone cried on this movie. You’re working six-day weeks, very high-intensity scenarios.” Landes himself was working seven-day weeks. One morning he woke up and couldn’t move. The gold miners put him on a stretcher and carried him up a canyon until they reached a local medical centre. He cried on the journey, distraught that the production might collapse. He was back behind the camera 20 hours later. “I think it was just the stress,” he says. “And the ration diet.”

It was worth it. The film has earned universal raves – and a special prize in San Sebastián film festival, Spain, for accurately reflecting “the values and reality” of LGBTQ people. The story is a nightmare in which nothing – gender, sexuality, political allegiance – is muddled or irrelevant. “It’s not binary. That’s why I think it reaches much further than Colombia. That is what’s most timely and relevant. I wanted to make sure that the film spoke not to the moment but to us as a species.”

894,"As part of their carefully orchestrated coup d’état, Technocrats have declared war on an unseeable virus. The respective ‘army’ of foot soldiers is now revealed as ‘Contact Tracers’ who will kickstart the national panopticon grid of total surveillance.

The specific marketing propaganda to implement this is that it “will help us emerge from lockdown.” You want to emerge from lockdown, don’t you? This subtle lever of coercion is to ensure public acceptance. Since each state is responsible for their own surveillance programs, it is estimated that collectively, there will be a force of at least 300,000 such snitches. When one shows up at your door, you would be well advised to tell them to get lost and never come back. ⁃ TN Editor

Contact Tracing? Really? That’s the next big government program to push for total surveillance over our lives. Now the real fallout from the Coronapocalypse comes to light.

The very people who created a fake pandemic out of faulty statistics, media fear-pimping and the rankest of propaganda are now pushing the total surveillance state to protect us (them?) from the next crisis.

James Corbett from the Corbett Report just published an excellent video discussing ‘contact tracing’ as promulgated by (who else?) the Clinton Global Initiative to create an army of new Brown Shirts to assist our wise and benevolent leaders in managing us like livestock.

James is urging us not to use their Orwellian term, and I agree with him. But the best way to do that is to make fun of it and them.

I propose just looking at them and saying, “Don’t Trace Me, Bro.”

As always when they want to herd us towards a terrible idea they first have to come up with a harmless sounding euphemism for it. Either that or just call it a war that we’re going to fight and win together, you know, for kids!

But this was always the plan with this virus. We can speculate as to why this has been done, why it was directed from the commanding heights of our society but, in the end, that speculation is irrelevant.

This is happening, it’s here and they are now working to square the circle. The goal is to finish off the last vestiges of anonymity and individuality started with the destruction of financial privacy during the Clinton Adminstration, which was wrapped in the classic government phrases “Know Your Customer” and “Anti-Money Laundering”

Now those sets of rules which got ramped up after 9/11 dominate the global financial landscape.

But, let’s look at what’s happened with COVID-19 step-by-step.

First, a virus shows up in China which people in the highest levels of our government were briefed about as early as November, if Pepe Escobar’s research is to be believed.

The gold standard remains the ABC News report according to which intel collected in November 2019 by the National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI), a subsidiary of the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), was already warning about a new virulent contagion getting out of hand in Wuhan, based on “detailed analysis of intercepted communications and satellite imagery”.

An unnamed source told ABC, “analysts concluded it could be a cataclysmic event”, adding the intel was “briefed multiple times” to the DIA, the Pentagon’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, and even the White House.

Next China, the gold standard for the Orwellian Panopticon, proceeds to use that Panopticon to prove to the world how effective government can be in containing a deadly plague.

That model, which runs fundamentally counter to billions of years of evolution and basid immunology, is then propagated around the Western world to combat COVID-19, a disease which has a mortality rate similar to the annual flu, to shut down those economies exacerbating a financial crisis already fully underway.

This destroys the lives of hundreds of millions of people. It creates economic dislocations that make the Great Depression look like a mild recession.

In places like Italy, France and Spain where youth unemployment has been in double digits for more than a decade, the lock down was used as a way to tamp down social unrest, as they were hot beds for opposition to inept and increasingly fascistic governments.

In the U.S., a country ruled by old, ideologically-possessed and corrupt Boomers who have been in a heightened state of fear since Donald Trump was elected saw the opportunity to create the worst possible outcome in places like New York and California.

Governors in blue states seized power they didn’t legally have and cried for help they didn’t need.

And the confusion and disinformation about the virus created so much fear people willingly huddled in their homes hoping the angel of death passed them by with nothing more to do than be glued to the death counter in a desperate bid to stay informed about the science.

But there weren’t two million dead in the U.S. There’s around 50,000 and those death statistics are very speicous since the people reporting them have motive, means and opportunity to inflate them to get Federal aid, advance their political agendas now on full display and cover their asses.

So, now ‘contact tracing’ which is just a euphemism for total surveillance. But they are admitting that they can’t do it themselves. They need help. In totalitarian governments like the U.K., they’ll have an app in a couple of weeks.

Mr Gould told the Science and Technology Committee the app would be “technically ready” for deployment in “two to three weeks” – but made it clear it was only one part of the strategy to emerge from lockdown and would involve a none-too-subtle marketing campaign.

“If you want to protect the NHS and stop it being overwhelmed and, at the same time, want to get the economy moving, then the app is going to be part of an essential part of a strategy for doing that,” he said.

China already has this. All across the enlightened West countries will now recruit tens of thousands of ‘contact tracers’ to go out and build their network for them, just like Gavin Newsome and Andrew Cuomo discussed with Bill Clinton in the video linked above.

And since there are now tens of millions of people out of work desperate for a job of any sort finding recruits will be easy.

See how this works?

First you destroy people’s lives, then you print trillions in funny money to bail out the inept and continue paying the enforcers, ensuring they are fed. And then when desperation reaches its peak you create a new government program and turn people into snitches to ensure compliance.

We’re going to empower the worst busybodies who are already insane with fear to run around collecting data for the government.

All in the name of getting the economy back up and running!

I’m pretty sure when I read The Scarlet Letter in high school we didn’t consider Hester Prynne to be the bad guy. Because the person who is COVID-19 positive will now have a big red “CV” on them which will limit their ability to partake in society.

The next stage will be to force them to lock themselves down in isolation or face the depredations of the State. And even if we begin to ignore such insanity the next step will be to look the other way when the contact tracers become belligerent.

This is all about keeping everyone in a heightened state of fear at all times. The Karens will bee worried about a stupid germ and everyone else will be worried about what the Karens will do.

Because what good is this app if it doesn’t report you to the authorities who know where you are.

So the solution to a virus and the incompetence of our governments is to turn busy bodies into brown shirts and COVID positives into social pariahs.

Do you realize what happens when you don’t pay a parking ticket now? Eventually your licence gets suspended, then your car insurance gets canceled. If you don’t turn your tag in for not having insurance then you are risking jail time when you get stopped by the police. They arrest you for driving on a suspended licence, impound your car, and the entire ordeal becomes a bureaucratic nightmare.

The moral of the story? Pay your parking ticket, obviously.

But not because you were a bad person or committed a heinous crime. But because you broke the rules. If you don’t follow the State’s rules, no matter how petty, no matter how asinine you will be punished to the full extent of the law.

Do you really think this ‘contact tracing’ system won’t end up in the same kind of hell?

Now you’re a documented threat to other people’s lives! You’re an evil spreader, man! Think of the children!

The State is only good at two things. Killing people and creating perverse incentives. And if this isn’t a classic case of creating the perverse incentive of destroying civilization in order to save it I don’t know what is?

This is the real danger of 5G technology. It isn’t China having a backdoor embedded by Huawei, it is the State having the ability to blanket the world in high bandwidth snooping devices everywhere that people congregate.

Their system is failing before our eyes. It’s a system born of corrupt money begetting ever greater institutional corruption. They wouldn’t be pushing for this total surveillance if they weren’t uniquely paranoid about our readiness to throw them overboard.

They want us snitching on each other and suspect of each other. This is the most pernicious form of social control ever devised, to distrust basic human contact and interaction because there are germs in the world.

It’s time to end the mass hallucination that we’ve never dealt with something like this before. The mass branding of this COVID-19 as the plague is laughable and the push for global surveillance is pathetic.

Unfortunately, we live in a world today where the fearful are empowered by the powerful to mob the non-compliant. COVID-19 isn’t the plague folks. If you think it’s the crisis you should be fearful of I urge you to seek therapy not the false security of a government tracking app.

430,"THE FBI were called in to probe whether or not the legendary Bigfoot was actually real, newly released documents reveal.

The top secret papers disclose scientists from the organisation even carried out scientific tests on ""hair or fur"" said to be from the mythical apeman.

Peter Byrne, then the director of the Bigfoot Information Center, wrote a letter in 1976 asking that the FBI ""set the record straight, once and for all"".

His call came after it was reported the bureau had analysed hair or fur that was not identifiable as ""that of any known creature on this continent"".

FBI Assistant Director Jay Cochran, who headed the bureau's lab division at the time, responded that he was unable to find any records of such an examination, the papers reveal.

However, Byrne, then requested an examination of what he saw as an exciting new sample of Bigfoot fur.

""We do not often come across hair which we are unable to identify and the hair that we have now, about 15 hairs attached to a tiny piece of skin, is the first that we have obtained in six years which we feel may be of importance,"" Byrne wrote.

Cochran responded saying while the FBI usually focused on criminal investigations ""in the interest of research and scientific inquiry, we make exceptions to this general policy"".

An image released by the FBI shows a hair and tissue sample sent to the FBI labs in the 1970s What is Bigfoot and does it really exist? Bigfoot, also known as Sasquatch, is said to be a giant ape-like creature that is said to roam the Northwest of the US. There is scant evidence such creatures exist, but Bigfoot buffs are convinced they do - and science will one day prove it. While most sightings occur in the Northwest, the mythical creatures have been reported all over the country. The most famous image of a Bigfoot is from a film taken in 1967 by Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin in Bluff Creek, California. It shows a huge dark, man-sized and man-shaped figure lumbering through a woodland clearing. While widely considered a hoax, it remains to this day the best evidence for the existence of Bigfoot. ""With this understanding, we will examine the hairs and tissue mentioned in your letter."" The sample was then analysed to check its ""structure and thickness"" before being compared ""with hairs of known origin under a comparison microscope"". However, the eventual results were not as Byrne had hoped, reports CNN. ""It was concluded as a result of these examinations that the hairs are of deer family origin,"" Cochran later revealed. The FBI made public 22 documents from it records archive on Wednesday - including its bulging 22-page Bigfoot file. Peter Byrne’s web page says that he “has always had an interest in the unknown and the mysterious” since his father used to tell him bedtime stories about the Yeti of the Himalayas.

678,"Genetic testing confirms the legendary Bigfoot is a human relative that arose some 15,000 years ago — at least according to a press release issued by a company called DNA Diagnostics detailing supposed work by a Texas veterinarian.

The release and alleged study by Melba S. Ketchum also suggests such cryptids had sex with modern human females that resulted in hairy hominin hybrids, but the scientific community is dubious about her claim.

""A team of scientists can verify that their five-year long DNA study, currently under peer-review, confirms the existence of a novel hominin hybrid species, commonly called 'Bigfoot' or 'Sasquatch,' living in North America,"" the release reads. ""Researchers' extensive DNA sequencing suggests that the legendary Sasquatch is a human relative that arose approximately 15,000 years ago.""

For her study, Ketchum obtained three ""whole nuclear genomes from purported Sasquatch samples. The genome sequencing shows that Sasquatch mtDNA is identical to modern Homo sapiens, but Sasquatch nuDNA is a novel, unknown hominin related to Homo sapiens and other primate species."" (Mitochondrial DNA, or mtDNA, is the DNA that resides in the cell's energy-producing structures, and is typically passed down from mothers, while nuclear DNA, nuDNA, resides in the cells' nuclei and is passed down from both parents to offspring.)

""Our data indicate that the North American Sasquatch is a hybrid species, the result of males of an unknown hominin species crossing with female Homo sapiens,"" the statement reads. [Infographic: Tracking Belief in Bigfoot]

So where's the evidence? Well, there is none. Not yet, anyway: Ketchum's research has not appeared in any peer-reviewed scientific journal, and there's no indication when that might happen. If the data are good and the science is sound, any reputable science journal would jump at the chance to be the first to publish this groundbreaking information. Until then, Ketchum has refused to let anyone else see her evidence.

Of course the history of Bigfoot is rife with exaggerated and premature claims about proof of the creature's existence. For decades, various types of evidence have been offered as final, definitive proof, ranging from Bigfoot hair to blood to dead bodies. Without exception, the evidence has always been hoaxed, misidentification or inconclusive.

Because Ketchum has released no information at all about her findings (nor have they been examined by outside experts), it's impossible to evaluate the validity of her conclusions. But an important clue can be found in her statement that ""Sasquatch mtDNA is identical to modern Homo sapiens.""

If the mitochontrial DNA is identical to Homo sapiens (i.e., modern humans), then this suggests one of two options. The first, endorsed by Ketchum, is that Bigfoot ancestors had sex with women about 15,000 years ago and created a half-human hybrid species currently hiding across North America. [Rumor or Reality: The Creatures of Cryptozoology]

There is, however, another, simpler interpretation of such results: The samples were contaminated. Whatever the sample originally was — Bigfoot, bear, human or something else — it's possible that the people who collected and handled the specimens accidentally introduced their DNA into the sample, which can easily occur with something as innocent as a spit, sneeze or cough. No one outside of Ketchum's team knows how this alleged Bigfoot DNA was collected, from where or by whom. It could have been collected by the world's top forensics experts, or by a pair of amateur Bigfoot buffs with no evidence-gathering training.

How did the team definitively determine that the samples were from a Bigfoot? Did they take a blood or saliva sample from a living Bigfoot? If so, how did they get that close, and why didn't they simply capture it or photograph it? If the samples were found in the wild, how do they know it wasn't left by another animal — or possibly even a hunter, hiker or camper who left human genetic material?

Previous alleged Bigfoot samples subjected to DNA analysis have been deemed ""unknown"" or ""unidentified."" However, ""unknown"" or ""unidentified"" results do not mean ""Bigfoot."" There are many reasons why a DNA sample might come back unknown, including that it was contaminated or too degraded by environmental conditions. Or it could simply mean that the animal it came from was not among the reference samples that the laboratory used for comparison. There is no reference sample of Bigfoot DNA to compare it with, so by definition, there cannot be a conclusive match.

Ketchum also issued a statementrequesting that the U.S. government immediately recognize Bigfoot as ""an indigenous people and immediately protect their human and Constitutional rights against those who would see in their physical and cultural differences a 'license' to hunt, trap, or kill them."" Since no Bigfoot has ever been hunted, trapped or killed, it's not clear that the creatures — if they exist — require any special federal protection.

Ketchum's is not the only genetics-based project intended to find Bigfoot. Earlier this year, researchers from Oxford University and the Lausanne Museum of Zoology announced they were collecting samples of alleged Bigfoot and Yeti hair for genetic identification. Oxford geneticist Bryan Sykes collected materials from the public from May through September, and is currently conducting DNA analysis. Once the results are in, he plans to submit his results to a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

If Ketchum has the definitive proof she claims, the world will soon know about it, and Bigfoot will be proven once and for all. On the other hand, if the evidence never appears, or is inconclusive and flawed, the search will continue.

1288,"The latest Wikileaks dump is said to be the “biggest exposure of CIA spying secrets ever”. It reveals how the agency hacks into consumer products to turn them into spying devices … and how it can even remotely take control of cars.

Entitled Vault 7: CIA Hacking Tools Revealed, the latest Wikileaks dump contains tons of documents explaining how the CIA has hundreds of zero-day exploits (holes in software that are unknown to the vendor) and can hack almost any smart tv, Android phone, iPhone, or router, and, apparently, recent cars as well. Not only that, the agency can even leave the “footprint” of another entity while doing the hacking, effectively allowing them to put the blame on a foreign nation or organization. The documents state:

The CIA, working with British spy agency MI5, have developed a back door for a smart TV that allows government snooping while the television is turned off. And that may now include live video streaming of your living room and office. In a 2014 document detailing future and improvements to the program, CIA officials said they planned to add a feature where the Agency could capture video and video snapshots of people through their televisions. This would put the federal government and the CIA right in your family room and office.

Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized “zero day” exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.

According to the documents, the CIA has been using the State Department consulate in Frankfurt Germany as a headquarters for hackers in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

The organization has been collecting a library of attack techniques from malware produced in other states, including Russia. The CIA has the ability to use this library to misdirect attribution of hacks by leaving behind the “fingerprints” of stolen malware.

Probably the most startling portion of this dump is the revelation that the CIA has gained the ability to “hack” into recent cars through their control systems. Note that we are not even talking about self-driving cars (which will certainly become 100% CIA-remote-controlled), but regular cars with computerized components (around 2011 and earlier). Why would they want to do that? To “engage in nearly undetectable assassinations”.

These revelations shed a new light on the very mysterious death of journalist Michael Hastings, who lost his life after his car suddenly went out of control and crashed.

Hastings was a journalist, a contributing editor to Rolling Stone and reporter for BuzzFeed. He became a vocal critic of the surveillance state during the investigation of reporters by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2013, referring to the restrictions on the freedom of the press by the Obama administration as a “war” on journalism. His last story, “Why Democrats Love to Spy On Americans”, was published by BuzzFeed on June 7. Hastings died in a fiery high-speed automobile crash on June 18, 2013, in Los Angeles, California.

On June 18, 2013, Hastings died in a single vehicle automobile crash in his Mercedes C250 Coupé at approximately 4:25 a.m. in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. A witness to the crash said the car seemed to be traveling at maximum speed and was creating sparks and flames before it fishtailed and crashed into a palm tree. Video from a nearby security camera purportedly shows Hastings’ vehicle speeding and bursting into flames. Witnesses described the car’s engine being ejected 50 to 60 yards (46–55 m) from the scene. Hastings’ body was burned beyond recognition. The coroner identified the body by matching fingerprints with those the FBI had on file. Two days after the crash, the Los Angeles Police Department declared that there were no signs of foul play. The coroner’s report ruled the death to be an accident. An autopsy showed that the cause of death was massive blunt force trauma consistent with a high-speed crash.

 – Los Angeles Times, “Michael Hastings death: New video of crash emerges”

A news article from 2015 actually mentioned that Hasting’s death was most like the result of a “car cyber attack”.

Former U.S. National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism Richard A. Clarke said that what is known about the crash is “consistent with a car cyber attack”. He was quoted as saying “There is reason to believe that intelligence agencies for major powers — including the United States — know how to remotely seize control of a car. So if there were a cyber attack on [Hastings’] car — and I’m not saying there was, I think whoever did it would probably get away with it.” “Hastings’ work as a thorn in the side of government and the 33-year-old journalist’s death in an unusual crash in June 2013 immediately triggered speculation. A witness reported seeing Hastings’ new silver Mercedes C250 coupe speeding down a Hollywood street before dawn when it bounced, slammed into a tree and burst into flames. Shortly before Hastings’ death, he sent what was described as a “panicky” email to friends expressing concern that associates were being interviewed by “the Feds.” He also wrote that he was onto a big story and needed to “get off the radar for a bit.” His 2010 story for Rolling Stone in which Stanley McChrystal skewered the White House and its strategy in Afghanistan led to the general’s resignation. The FBI denied Hastings was the target of any investigation, yet a Freedom of Information Act request later unearthed an FBI file on Hastings. Hastings also told a neighbor he thought someone had been tampering with his car. At the time of his death, he was working on an article about CIA director John Brennan.

 – Who.What.Why, “CAR HACKING REPORT REFUELS CONCERNS ABOUT MICHAEL HASTINGS CRASH”

According to several sources, Hasting’s last days very hectic.

“In an email to colleagues, which was copied to and released by Hastings’ friend, Army Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, Hastings said that he was “onto a big story”, that he needed to “go off the radar”, and that the FBI might interview them. WikiLeaks announced that Hastings had also contacted Jennifer Robinson, one of its lawyers, a few hours prior to the crash, and the LA Weekly reported that he was preparing new reports on the CIA at the time of his death. His widow Elise Jordan said his final story was a profile of CIA Director John O. Brennan. The FBI released a statement denying that Hastings was being investigated. USA Today reported that in the days before his death, Hastings believed his car was being “tampered with” and that he was scared and wanted to leave town. ‘At 12:30 a.m. on the morning he died, an agitated Michael Hastings went to his neighbor and friend Jordanna Thigpen and asked to borrow her car. He said he was afraid to drive his own car, because he believed that someone had been tampering with it. “He was scared, and he wanted to leave town,” Thigpen recalls. But she declined, saying her car was having mechanical problems. When she woke up, Hastings was dead, his car having crashed into a tree.’ Hastings died in a single vehicle automobile crash in his Mercedes C250 Coupé at approximately 4:25 a.m. in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.

218,"Believe it or not, one person can have two feet that are slightly different in size and shape. And even if yours seem identically matched, they don't necessarily remain a constant size. Your feet can actually be different sizes at different times of the day. There are also more lasting changes: Most feet gradually widen with age, and sometimes women's feet ""grow"" (because of muscle relaxation during pregnancy) after the birth of a child.

Whatever the size of your feet (at any given time) it's important to buy the right shoes -- shoes that will fit correctly and offer your feet and ankles the support they need. The following suggestions will help you become a smart shoe shopper.

Shop for shoes in the late afternoon or evening, since that's when your feet are the biggest (they swell during the day). Have the salesperson measure both feet while you're standing up, because your feet expand under the weight of your body. Carefully consider the fit and walking comfort of each pair of shoes you try and keep in mind that ""size 8"" in three different styles, even from the same manufacturer, can fit your feet differently.

If you have wide feet, always ask (even if the salesperson has measured your feet) if the style you've chosen comes in a wide width. Fortunately, comfortable shoes have become popular -- even stylish -- and shoe manufacturers are waking up to the fact that not everyone has a medium-width foot. Some manufacturers make shoes as wide as triple-E (on a scale of A to E, with AA being the narrowest).

There are two other contributors to your shoe ""size"" as well: The shape of your foot (how the shoe's ""upper"" conforms to your foot) and the heel height that is best for you. Because high heels shift body weight onto the front of your feet, heavy people and people with bunions, corns, hammertoes, and the like should opt for lower heels. If you have excessively pronated (""flat"") feet, Achilles tendinitis, short calf muscles, or knee problems, however, shoes with a moderate heel may be more comfortable for you, because they lessen the pull on already-overstretched tendons and muscles.

Once you know your size, you can begin to select shoes that will be more comfortable. However, give your feet a break and avoid the six foot-foiling shoe styles discussed here:

With all this in mind, now it's time to look for a new pair of shoes. Most people think that trying on shoes is about how the shoes feel on your feet. That's true. Certainly, if they don't feel good, you don't want them. But you should evaluate shoes based on several more-specific factors:

Two more general tips: If your two feet are different sizes, choose shoes that fit the bigger foot. (You can pad or add support inserts to the other shoe.) And never buy shoes that are too stiff or too tight with the expectation that you will ""break them in."" You're likely to suffer much longer than you expected.

Although all this means that you must be a sophisticated and patient shoe shopper, the good news is that many fashionable shoes currently on the market meet all of these qualifications, and many even resemble athletic shoes in design.

This is especially good news for the 59 percent of American women who wear high-heeled shoes every day. As consumers have become more health conscious, shoe manufacturers have given new attention to developing good-looking shoes (even with heels) that won't hurt your feet.

Selecting the right athletic shoe for the type of sport or exercise you enjoy is an even more specific task. Get some pointers on this process on the next page.

810,"South African Author, Scientist, Researcher and Explorer Michael Tellinger (often called ‘The South African Indiana Jones’) shows off what could be one of the best pieces of evidence that there were once giants living on Earth a long, long time ago.

Geologists have been marveling at this giant foot print in rough granite, about 4 feet long. Some still say that it is a natural erosion pattern, but for now it’s hard to say.

Prof. Pieter Wagener from UPE, suggests that “there is a higher probability of little green men arriving from space and licking it out with their tongues, than being created by natural erosion.”

It is located in South Africa, near the town of Mpaluzi, close to the Swaziland border.

It is estimated to be between 200 million and 3 Billion years old because of our current understanding of the formation of granites in Earth’s history. This dating immediately causes great debate and argument – so I urge you to keep your mind open and focused on the evidence.

This amazing footprint in granite was discovered in 1912 by a hunter called Stoffel Coetzee, while hunting in the remote area. At the time this was a deeply remote part of South Africa known as the Eastern Transvaal, teeming with wildlife, including antelope and lions.

It remains in the same condition as it was when first discovered and the possibility that this was a carved hoax is extremely low because of its remote location.

Even today, it is difficult to find. The real mystery is how this amazing phenomenon occurred – I have no idea – but here it is and we cannot wish it away. YES – It is granite – it is a well recognised geological part of South Africa and recorded on all geological maps – that is why this footprint is such an incredible mystery.

It can be described as a “phenocrystic” granite, OR coarse porphyritic granite, that underwent several different stages of cooling. The result being an interesting mixture of large and small granules. This is why granite companies are keen to mine this area for granite because it will look really “pretty” when polished.

In the official Geology Of South Africa, this outcrop is called Mpuluzi Batholith (Granite) and the official dating of this rock produced dates of around 3,1 billion years.

This bone has been in the vaults of of the medical school at WITS University, Johannesburg since the early 1960s, when it was found by miners in a mine in northern Namibia. It is one of the most precious and rare specimens available today that clearly indicate the existence of giants in Southern Africa more than 40,000 years ago.

270,"PARIS (Reuters) – The courtyard around the Louvre Museum’s famed glass pyramid is to become the stage for a giant interactive performance orchestrated by French visual artist JR as part of celebrations for the structure’s 30th anniversary.

An army of volunteers on Tuesday started pasting a colossal 160,000 square feet paper image over the courtyard to prepare for the trompe l’oeil.

The image will create the illusion of a larger pyramid emerging from rocks as if it had been discovered by an archaeological excavation.

The 70-foot-high glass-and-steel pyramid, designed by Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei, now aged 101, was controversial when it was inaugurated in the classical setting of the Louvre in March 1989. But has since become a beloved Paris landmark.

“The pyramid has always inspired me, the way it mixes the ancient and the modern,” JR told Reuters. “This time, a big part of it is to confront the modern with archaeology.”

The new trompe l’oeil will be fully visible from Friday evening only from the museum’s roof. JR’s team has installed two giant screens on the courtyard to allow visitors to see the result from the ground.

For two days, Saturday and Sunday, the courtyard will be open for visitors to walk on it and observe the optical illusion.

“Once everything is pasted, people will be over the image and it will fade away and disappear,” JR said.

The interactive part of the project – volunteers enrolling to paste 32-foot-long paper strips and tourists walking, watching and appearing on the video shot from above – is what attracted the Louvre authorities.

“The visitor is always at the heart of our concern, with always the goal to better welcome them,” Louvre president Jean-Luc Martinez said.

The performance is a continuation of a giant trompe l’oeil three years ago that made the pyramid disappear behind a giant black-and-white photo.

The pyramid is the most popular of a series of ambitious projects launched by then President Francois Mitterrand in the 1980s and 1990s that changed the image of the French capital.

70,"Experts have cast doubt on the work of a key scientist whose apocalyptic prediction that coronavirus could kill 500,000 Britons led Boris Johnson to decide he had to lock down the country. Professor Neil Ferguson, director of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College, London, authored a report which forecast that terrible death toll if nothing was done to stop the spread of the disease.

Even plans to slow the virus – letting around two-thirds of the population catch coronavirus to build up ‘herd immunity’ – would result in 250,000 deaths, according to Imperial’s mathematical model. Prof Ferguson’s devastating conclusion led the Prime Minister to perform a drastic U-turn a fortnight ago. Schools were closed and people told to stay at home.

Last week, Prof Ferguson told MPs these measures could see the eventual death toll cut to ‘substantially less’ than 20,000. Meanwhile a paper by separate colleagues at Imperial predicted just 5,700 deaths if the lockdown continues.

Now a rival academic has claimed Prof Ferguson has a patchy record of modelling epidemics, which could have led to hasty Ministerial decisions.

Professor Michael Thrusfield of Edinburgh University said Prof Ferguson was previously instrumental in modelling that led to the cull of more than 6 million animals during the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001, which left rural Britain economically devastated.

 Then, Prof Ferguson and his Imperial colleagues concluded: ‘Extensive culling is sadly the only option for controlling the current British epidemic.’ But Prof Thrusfield, an expert in animal diseases, claimed the model made incorrect assumptions about how foot and mouth disease was transmitted and, in a 2006 review, he claimed Imperial’s foot and mouth model was ‘not fit for purpose’, while in 2011 he said it was ‘severely flawed’

Born Valerie Jane Morris-Goodall in London in 1934, her father, Mortimer, was a businessman; her mother, Myfanwe (Vanne) Morris Goodall, was a novelist and looked after her family. The expectations for Jane were standard issue for the time: a marriage to a nice, responsible man, followed by a few children. To her credit, her mother never discouraged her interests: animals, the natural world, and above all, the wildlife of Africa. Once Vanne discovered that little Jane had brought a handful of earthworms to bed; rather than shrieking, she explained that her new little friends needed the soil to live, and together, they took them back to the garden.

Jane was a quiet girl, a bookworm who adored Doctor Dolittle and devoured the Tarzan novels. Reading did its usual stealthy, life-changing thing: Jane developed a deep love of animals and a longing to go to Africa and live among the wild animals. But World War II was raging, and her family had little money. Instead of university, Jane enrolled in secretarial college, graduating in 1952.

Meanwhile, one of Jane’s school friends had moved to Kenya and invited her to come for a visit. Jane was working in London selecting music for advertising films at the time. In a move that seems so very right now, she moved home and worked as a waitress to finance the trip. When she had saved enough, she quit her job and off she went.

By which I mean she took an exciting, month-long journey from England, around the Cape of Good Hope, to Mombasa, eventually making her way to Nairobi. There she met Dr. Louis Leakey, the great archaeologist and paleoanthropologist who traced our human origins to Africa. Leakey was charismatic, influential, and, at the time, a curator at Nairobi’s natural history museum. He offered Jane a job there, then invited her to come along on a dig at Olduvai Gorge. She spent three glorious months immersed in painstaking tasks: removing dirt from a fossil with a dental pick no bigger than your pinkie finger, or digging gently with a hunting knife. Leakey saw in her a person who was patient and thorough: one who could survive long stretches of isolation, who could sit and watch and learn. In short, she was the perfect candidate for his latest project—observing primates in the wild—and when he asked whether she would be interested in setting up camp at Gombe Stream on the shores of remote Lake Tanganyika, she didn’t hesitate for a moment.",mainstream,M0aeb4,big.foot

“I DO think there’s a ‘squatch in these woods….”

What the heck has happened to science on television? Animal Planet has a show called “Finding Bigfoot,” with a guy looking like he just cleaned out all the pork rinds at the Piggly Wiggly telling us he believes “there’s a “squatch” in these woods….”

“Sasquatches DO exist,” insists another sasquatch hunter, doing his best to look and sound serious, in the show’s accidentally comical commercial.

We shouldn’t single out Animal Planet for scorn, however. The channel does have silly company. The History Channel has a show called UFO Hunters. Planet Green has a show called UFOs over Earth. These and other channels show Nostradamus programs more regularly than they show microscopes and telescopes combined.

Against this backdrop, I suppose we shouldn’t be surprised by incessantly ridiculous claims and headlines about global warming.

Global warming causes earthquakes. Global warming causes depression. Global warming causes tsunamis. Global warming causes wife beatings. Global warming causes acne. Global warming causes AIDS. Global warming causes a greater likelihood of a UFO invasion.

No, seriously, scientist-activists and their media allies have alleged each of the above, and then some.

Just as microscopes and telescopes are glaringly missing on the “science” and “history” shows about sasquatches and UFOs, so too is the Scientific Method glaringly missing from alarming global warming claims.

“Global warming is a crisis because our computer models predict it will be.”

But your computer models predicted more warming for the present than has actually occurred.”

“Um, well, we have fixed that. Really.”

Don’t your billions of dollars of annual government funding dry up if global warming turns out not to be a crisis?

“Maybe, but we are guided by altruism and science.”

Can we take a look at the original data you used and can we examine your procedures?

“Why should I show them to you when you will simply try to find something wrong with them?”

Because that is how science works. Can we see them please?

“No, that would violate my privacy rights and my academic freedom.”

Then why should we believe a global warming crisis truly exists?

I guess if such ridiculous circular logic passes for New Age science and if such ridiculous alleged harms as acne, wife beatings and UFO invasions are presented as legitimate global warming crises, then why should we NOT have Bigfoot, UFOs and Nostradamus appearing front and center on science and history programs.

Did you hear about the most recent one? Global warming is causing mutant sharks.

Two different shark subspecies appear to be breeding together in the waters off the coast of Australia. The Australian blacktip shark and the common blacktip shark seem to have been listening to Barry White music and getting their groove on together. Kind of like wolves breeding with husky dogs or German shepherds breeding with golden retrievers.

No big deal, really, except that some clever rainmaker for government grants has found a way to assert a connection with global warming. “The Australian blacktip is smaller and tends to live in warmer waters near northern and eastern Australia. Its globally distributed counterpart, the common blacktip, is larger and favors cooler waters,” explains the Jan. 3 Christian Science Monitor.

Did you get that? The Australian blacktip shark lives in warm waters. The common blacktip shark lives globally, in both warm and cool waters, but allegedly “favors cooler waters.” Therefore, if a few Australian blacktips and a few common blacktips get together and do the wild thing, global warming must be the reason. Now somebody please start shoveling some government grants our way.

By the way, what type of scientific evidence supports the asserted global warming connection?

Please allow me to quote the Huffington Post: “Lead researcher Jess Morgan said, ‘If [the Australian blacktip] hybridizes with the common species it can effectively shift its range further south into cooler waters, so the effect of this hybridizing is a range expansion.’”

OK, let’s get this straight. The immensely intelligent and forward-thinking Australian blacktip shark knows that humans are burning fossil fuels and have just failed to renew the Kyoto Protocol. This would seem to be good news for the warm water-loving Australian blacktip. Nevertheless, the Australian blacktip realizes that too much of its favored warm water might at some point in the future become a bad thing. Therefore, the Australian blacktips all got together and came up with a scheme to seduce unsuspecting common blacktip sharks so that they can find a way to survive in COOLER waters. All of this, of course, is to adjust to anticipated future decades of human-caused global warming.

Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant! Whoever said sharks were stupid?!

570,"I am writing you this open letter to defend myself against your attack on me personally and professionally. What is the evidentiary basis behind your characterization of my academic work as “repulsive, offensive and not reflective of Alberta”? Why have you decided to set yourself up, Premier Notley, as some sort of arbitrator of what scholarly work in Alberta universities meets the criteria of being “reflective of Alberta”?

Is your opinion about what is or is not reflective of Alberta to become a new test of how curriculum will be created and how faculty members will be chosen in this province? What lies behind your decision to disseminate a caricature of me “standing at the head of the class” in order to “spread lies and conspiracy theories”? [1]

Since I began teaching in the Department of Native American Studies at the University of Lethbridge in 1990, I have never once seen in a student evaluation that reflects the kind of accusations you are pressing publicly on me. How is it you think you know more about me, including and what goes on in my classroom, than my own students?

After a year and a half of being subject to a ruthless trial-by-media, a new process is only now being initiated that from my perspective allows me to come forward for the first time to tell my side of the story before an investigating tribunal operating within the terms of our collective agreement. The process is going forward because of a court contestation that the U of L Board of Governors lost due to its unwillingness to adhere to the laws of labour relations in Alberta. Whose advice was the Board depending on when its members put themselves in such an untenable position?

Before we have even started the process that has come about because of the determined stand of the University of Lethbridge Faculty Association (ULFA) and the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT), you, Premier Notley, chose to inject a politicized salvo into the onslaught of vituperation against me that began on Aug. 26 of 2016.

Here is how the University of Lethbridge Faculty Association described your ill-advised political intervention:

The Faculty Association wishes to express its disappointment in the Premier’s words. As the union that represents Professor Hall in his employment relationship with the University of Lethbridge, the Faculty Association has endeavoured to have a fair and objective process employed for adjudicating Professor Hall’s academic scholarship and accountability through procedures in the collective agreement. We finally achieved this following significant effort and cost on our part and have a great deal of confidence in the appropriate academic procedures to which Professor Hall is now subject. 

Having the Premier draw conclusions about the acceptability of Professor Hall’s academic work prior to any decision rendered by an expert panel of qualified academics has the potential to undermine this very process we have fought to achieve. At worse, though, these words have the real potential to bias the outcome of any such fair and objective process. 

The Faculty Association has greatly appreciated the hard work the Premier and her government have done to advance the rights of post-secondary labour. We believe it is a dangerous precedent, however, for elected officials to intervene so directly in a complex labour matter such as this one.

One of the core points I intend to bring forward in my self- defense in the forthcoming process, is to describe the mounting of a negative media campaign against me based on the atrocious contents of a maliciously-engineered Facebook post. According to B’nai Brith Canada, the core agency in orchestrating this media deception, the post appeared on, and then disappeared from, my Facebook wall during an interval of a few hours on Aug. 26, 2016. I did not invite this digital item onto my Facebook wall. I did not sanction its abhorrent contents. In fact I condemned the post’s contents publicly in mid-Sept. when I first became aware of the digital item and the way that it was being deployed to destroy my reputation.

You, Premier Notley, were presented with a deceptive account of my relationship to the Facebook post long before I even knew about the B’nai Brith Canada operation. Recently I learned from the results of a FOIP investigation of the Alberta Ministry of Justice that on Aug. 27, 2016 you and other Alberta cabinet ministers were sent a slanderous account of the Facebook post as if it “came from my lips.” People in the inner circle of your office reported you had seen the communication that slanderously misrepresented me as an “advocate for the murder of Jews.”

If you would actually take a genuine interest in my academic work, Premier Notley, you would realize I have a record of studying all sorts of genocide and condemning this crime against humanity in all its manifestations, including the Jewish Shoah. [2]

Perhaps the people who lied to you about me in late August of 2016 are still holding you captive in terms of filtering the information that has caused you to think whatever it is you believe you know about me. The President of the University of Lethbridge, Dr. Michael J. Mahon, went along with the Facebook deception to suspend this tenured full professor on Oct. 3 and 4, 2016. I was pulled from the classroom in mid-term and banned from stepping foot on campus. This purge took place entirely outside the terms of the collective agreement between the university’s faculty and administration.

This suspension initially without pay essentially declared me guilty until proven innocent. Severe punitive measures were imposed on me all without even an ounce of adjudication by a neutral third-party. From the correspondence I have been receiving from all over the world, I can say my suspension quickly became a shot heard throughout the global academic realm, a shot signaling that an Albertan university is leading an attack on the institutions of tenure, peer review and academic freedom.

Now you have joined in that attack too Premier Notley. You have allied yourself with the position of B’nai Brith Canada, the organization that recently interfered in the leadership race for the new leader of the federal NDP. The same people that set in motion the trial-by-media aimed at me attacked the NDP leadership candidate, Niki Ashton. According to B’nai Brith’s CEO Michael Mostyn, Ms. Ashton’s concern for the violated human rights of Palestinians people made her “an advocate for vile terrorists” and “convicted murders.” It revealed Ms. Ashton’s “defective moral compass.” [3]

What is your view, Premier Notley, of the condemnation directed at the new NDP federal leader, Jagmeet Singh, when B’nai Brith Canada took aim at him for intervening to provide a venue at the Ontario provincial legislature for a presentation by academic advocates of the rights of educator Nadia Shoufani. The condemnation came in late Augusts of 2016 when Mr. Singh was MLA for the riding of Bramalea-Gore-Malton and Deputy Leader of the Ontario NDP.

At the same time as it was attacking Jagmeet Singh, B’nai Brith Canada was leading the effort to have Ms. Shofani, a Canadian of Palestinian and Christian background, criminalized by police and fired from her teaching job in the Dufferin-Peel Catholic School Board. The criticisms directed at Ms. Shoufani are similar to those directed at Ms. Ashton. Similarly, the effort to criminalize Ms. Shoufani and bar her from the classroom anticipated the similar treatment to which I was about to be subjected. The attack on Ms. Shoufani’s job and her reputation was based on allegations about her supposed “terror-supporting remarks” made in a Quds Day speech in Toronto in July of 2016. [4]

It seems, Premier Notley, your political intervention on the wrong side of the University of Lethbridge case reflects your reactionary alliance with the thought police and speech police at B’nai Brith Canada. Your reactionary stance identifies you with the backward policies of former NDP leader, Tom Mulcair, when he purged pro-Palestinian candidates from the federal election of 2015. This atrocious move was in all probably a significant factor in the disappointing electoral showing of the NDP as it lost its position of Canada’s Official Opposition Party. [5]

Now in Feb. of 2018 B’nai Brith Canada has resumed its efforts to quarterback the NDP, lobbying aggressively to stop a resolution from being put on the floor of the recent NDP convention. The vote, neverthess, was close, 189 for putting the resolution forward and 200 for sidelining it. The resolution included provisions on a Canadian boycott against products produced in the illegal Israeli settlements in the Occupied West Bank.

Those supporting the boycott resolution included the unanimous support of the Young New Democrats, 28 electoral riding associations covering six provinces and many current and former MPs. Geneviève Nevin, a supporter of the resolution from Victoria, observed, “There’s a generational divide on this issue.” In his account of this divide within the NDP, journalist Derrick O’Keefe suggested Jagmeet Singh would be wise to look to the example of Jeremy Corbyn in the UK. Mr. Corbyn has mobilized on behalf of the Labour Party considerable electoral support from his attentiveness to the plight of Palestinian people under Israeli occupation. [6]

By siding so strongly, Premier Notley, with the U of L administration’s collaboration with the Isreal lobby including B’nai Brith Canada and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, you have identified yourself and your government with agencies that condemned Hassan Diab wrongly as a terrorist. B’nai Brith Canada played a major role in calling for pulling the sociology teacher from his Carleton University classroom in Ottawa. This intervention helped set in notion a miscarriage of justice that saw the Lebanese Canadian academic incarcerated for a decade in Canada and France for a crime he didn’t commit. [7]

You have identified yourself and your government, Premier Notley, with notorious enemies of academic freedom who brought forward during the 50th anniversary of York University all sorts of false allegations much like those I am facing now. This fiasco unfolded when B’nai Brith Canada, the CIJA, the Canadian Jewish Congress and the Jewish Defence League tried to shut down an academic conference on Israel/ Palestine at York University in 2009.

The effort to sabotage this academic initiative was foiled because the York University President, Mamdou Shoukiri, and the York University Board of Governors stood up for the imperatives of academic freedom. [8]

In 2018 in Alberta the equation is very different. The President and Board of University of Lethbridge have adopted the position of the Israel lobby. Now Premier Notley, you have intervened to strengthen this political coalition favouring the stiffling of free and open debate at Alberta universities. Please consider revisiting you provocative and intellectually bankrupt position on this matter.

If the political press was so overmatched then, think of our financial press today which is no match for big-cap corporations like Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet, even Apple. They avoid any discussion of pivotal variables in their future, research priorities or sector operating profit margins.

You could drive a bus through Amazon’s forecast of upcoming revenues and earnings, but a bus full of analysts blindly forecasts numbers that quarter-after-quarter wildly miss the mark, not just for Amazon, but Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Alibaba, too.

The negative press for these babies doesn’t relent. Past Sunday’s New York Times published a 16-page special section called “The Decade Tech Lost Its Way.” Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, particularly, are cited for hurting democracy and spreading misinformation. Maybe yes, maybe no. Let’s hope CNN keeps the Trump administration fairly honest, day by day.

Some background on the New York Times: First, it’s been a terrible investment these past 35 years while Rupert Murdoch took his News Corporation to the moon. The NYT ticked in the twenties back in 1987, presently $32.70. They leveraged themselves to buy the Boston Globe near the peak for newspaper publishing valuation, completely missing the nearly irrepressible surge in broadcasting, particularly subscription television.

The cardinal investment precept is never get bogged down in basket cases. I’m reminded of my mother’s experience with U.S. Steel which she bought in the fifties because she thought it was a bargain with a good dividend. But, its price is down some 90% since 1959 and its dividend was just cut to one cent.

Nothing good happened to U.S. Steel. It still makes plenty of steel but periodically shutters blast furnaces. Its market value is maybe $3 billion while Apple, Amazon and Alphabet trade near a trillion bucks, Facebook sits at a lousy $600 billion, but ready to break out. Consider, back in 1974, basic industrials accounted for nearly 20% of the market’s capitalized valuation. Today, we’re under 5%. Technology in 1974, even after the tremendous growth in semiconductors since early sixties, was as yet at 10% of the market.

Technology, at 20% of total sector weightings, seems headed much higher. Microsoft is ahead over 50% from its 12-month low while Apple is a double. Yes, up from $142. For the NYT to single out tech for losing its way this past decade doesn’t do justice to these tremendous overachievers and what it’s meant for our economy, the stock market and the country’s primacy in internet and e-commerce sectors.

Alibaba, I believe, is a sounder play than Amazon, but nobody takes away Jeff Bezos’ achievement as a leading player, from scratch, in cloud computing. Alibaba’s momentum in e-commerce prevails while Amazon as yet shows minimal margins in e-commerce. I see Alibaba developing its Ant Financial reach, particularly in money management, potentially a $500 billion business over five years, presently valued at $150 billion.

When I look at Facebook, my focus is on operating cash flow and the awesome reinvestment in research and development, near 20% of revenues. With the S&P 500 Index at 18 times forward 12-month projections, a heady multiplier, Facebook sells around 20 times my projection of operating income and at 15 times next year’s operating cash flow. Stock is at 20 times my $10 a share earnings estimate for 2020. Would you rather speculate in U.S. Steel with a penny dividend (how foolish can you get)?

My point is Mark Zuckerberg has paid for his hubris. As a stock, Facebook was $80 some five years ago, but past two years scarcely gained 10%. It is yet to take out the old high of $220 set in 2018. With a market capitalization around $600 billion it may never catch Apple and Microsoft, but Microsoft is no longer a bargain and I can’t model Apple with any conviction. I’m projecting Facebook’s 2020 operating cash flow at $40 billion, a serious number.

The New York Times should send its financial reporters to night school for MBAs. Unless they deal with numbers, with a strong background in the financial history of the country, they’ll make conclusions that are off-base and carry no weight or insight. Market capitalization of the NYT sits around $10 billion, not exactly a Facebook in the making, although you could say they’re both in the same business, communications.

But, the Sulzbergers underplayed the biggest, most lurid news in World War II. Namely, the destruction of millions of innocent Jews. Did their German Jewish origins get in the way? Maybe. German Jews look down their noses, still, on Eastern-European Jewry.

Ironically, many decades ago, I owned 15% of the NYT capitalization. I bought Saul Steinberg’s block. Saul thought he could break the family trust on two classes of stock, but he couldn’t. Mike Milken brokered the trade. I made some money and years later moved on with no regrets.

Somehow, the achievement scope of internet operators like Facebook goes unregarded, even ignored. Journalists hone in on Zuckerberg, himself, because Zuck makes for racy copy. Nobody cares to mention the Nasdaq 100 Index is ahead 45% this year. Yes, 45%. The magic of technological leverage plays on.

Facebook logs awesome raw numbers. R&D runs at $14 billion annualized, up 30% in the September quarter, year-over-year. Earnings rate is approaching $25 billion annualized. Contrast all this with U.S. Steel’s one-penny dividend. There’s no leverage in earnings power for basic industrials.

Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon comprise 20% of the market’s valuation. Without their built-in buoyancy, the market would languish. General Electric will never be a great operator while Exxon Mobil is an also-ran. General Motors’ come back from death’s door is notable but nobody cares much.

The New York Times remains the “Old Gray Lady” while Facebook is like Elvis Presley, swiveling his hips, kinetic footwork, belting out “Hound Dog.”

44,"Genetic testing confirms the legendary Bigfoot is a human relative that arose some 15,000 years ago — at least according to a press release issued by a company called DNA Diagnostics detailing supposed work by a Texas veterinarian.

The report from Melba S. Ketchum also suggests such cryptids had sex with modern human females that resulted in hairy hominin hybrids, but the scientific community is dubious about her claim.

""A team of scientists can verify that their five-year-long DNA study, currently under peer-review, confirms the existence of a novel hominin hybrid species, commonly called 'Bigfoot' or 'Sasquatch,' living in North America,"" the release reads. ""Researchers' extensive DNA sequencing suggests that the legendary Sasquatch is a human relative that arose approximately 15,000 years ago.""

For her study, Ketchum obtained three ""whole nuclear genomes from purported Sasquatch samples. The genome sequencing shows that Sasquatch mtDNA is identical to modern Homo sapiens, but Sasquatch nuDNA is a novel, unknown hominin related to Homo sapiens and other primate species."" (Mitochondrial DNA, or mtDNA, is the DNA that resides in the cell's energy-producing structures, and is typically passed down from mothers, while nuclear DNA, nuDNA, resides in the cells' nuclei and is passed down from both parents to offspring.)

""Our data indicate that the North American Sasquatch is a hybrid species, the result of males of an unknown hominin species crossing with female Homo sapiens,"" the statement reads. [ Infographic: Tracking Belief in Bigfoot ]

So where's the evidence? Well, there is none. Not yet, anyway: Ketchum's research has not appeared in any peer-reviewed scientific journal, and there's no indication when that might happen. If the data are good and the science is sound, any reputable science journal would jump at the chance to be the first to publish this groundbreaking information. Until then, Ketchum has refused to let anyone else see her evidence.

Of course the history of Bigfoot is rife with exaggerated and premature claims about proof of the creature's existence. For decades, various types of evidence have been offered as final, definitive proof, ranging from Bigfoot hair to blood to dead bodies. Without exception, the evidence has always been a hoax, misidentification or inconclusive.

Because Ketchum has released no information at all about her findings (nor have they been examined by outside experts), it's impossible to evaluate the validity of her conclusions. But an important clue can be found in her statement that ""Sasquatch mtDNA is identical to modern Homo sapiens.""

If the mitochontrial DNA is identical to Homo sapiens (i.e., modern humans), then this suggests one of two options. The first, endorsed by Ketchum, is that Bigfoot ancestors had sex with women about 15,000 years ago and created a half-human hybrid species currently hiding across North America. [ Rumor or Reality: The Creatures of Cryptozoology ]

There is, however, another, simpler interpretation of such results: The samples were contaminated. Whatever the sample originally was — Bigfoot, bear, human or something else — it's possible that the people who collected and handled the specimens accidentally introduced their DNA into the sample, which can easily occur with something as innocent as a spit, sneeze or cough. No one outside of Ketchum's team knows how this alleged Bigfoot DNA was collected, from where or by whom. It could have been collected by the world's top forensics experts, or by a pair of amateur Bigfoot buffs with no evidence-gathering training.
• 
• All lightning on Earth may have its roots in space, new research suggests.
• How our brains can track a 100 mph pitch

Confirming it's Bigfoot 

How did the team definitively determine that the samples were from a Bigfoot? Did they take a blood or saliva sample from a living Bigfoot ? If so, how did they get that close, and why didn't they simply capture it or photograph it? If the samples were found in the wild, how do they know it wasn't left by another animal — or possibly even a hunter, hiker or camper who left human genetic material?

Previous alleged Bigfoot samples subjected to DNA analysis have been deemed ""unknown"" or ""unidentified."" However, ""unknown"" or ""unidentified"" results do not mean ""Bigfoot."" There are many reasons why a DNA sample might come back unknown, including that it was contaminated or too degraded by environmental conditions. Or it could simply mean that the animal it came from was not among the reference samples that the laboratory used for comparison. There is no reference sample of Bigfoot DNA to compare it with, so by definition, there cannot be a conclusive match.

Ketchum also issued a statement requesting that the U.S. government immediately recognize Bigfoot as ""an indigenous people and immediately protect their human and Constitutional rights against those who would see in their physical and cultural differences a 'license' to hunt, trap, or kill them."" Since no Bigfoot has ever been hunted, trapped or killed, it's not clear that the creatures — if they exist — require any special federal protection.

Ketchum's is not the only genetics-based project intended to find Bigfoot. Earlier this year, researchers from Oxford University and the Lausanne Museum of Zoology announced they were collecting samples of alleged Bigfoot and Yeti hair for genetic identification. Oxford geneticist Bryan Sykes collected materials from the public from May through September, and is currently conducting DNA analysis. Once the results are in, he plans to submit his results to a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

If Ketchum has the definitive proof she claims, the world will soon know about it, and Bigfoot will be proven once and for all. On the other hand, if the evidence never appears, or is inconclusive and flawed, the search will continue.

422,"MADRID -- Just hours ahead of Britain's EU referendum, a group of fintech CEOs attending MoneyConf in the Spanish capital have made very clear Brexit is not a good idea for their sector.

“If Brexit happens, the U.K. suffers, Europe suffers,"" said Taavet Hinrikus, CEO and co-founder of TransferWise, a currency exchange platform. ""Today, London is the global fintech capital -- that's at risk.”

Some fintech executives said an Out vote on Thursday means firms might have to leave London.

""In the worst post-Brexit scenario, U.K. fintechs would need headquarters in another EU country,"" said the CEO of Barcelona-based Kantox, Philippe Gelis. ""In the best scenario, we will keep to 'business as usual.' ""

Daniel Döderlein, the founder and CEO of AUKA, a Norwegian cloud-based mobile payment firm, believes a Brexit would be like shooting oneself in the foot for the British fintech industry. “The current regulatory and economic ecosystem in the U.K. has created an ideal ecosystem for fintechs to thrive,"" he said.

But once outside the EU, added Döderlein, ""the U.K. isn’t as big or as global as it is now."" This means U.K. fintech firms that want to grow their business across the EU would have to ""go through regulatory challenges, opening up subsidiaries, restructuring legal entities, filing for a new license, and so forth -- it would be a huge problem.”

According to CurrencyCloud founder and chief Mike Laven, over time fintech firms can cope with such challenges, but the increased volatility, uncertainty, and complexity in the market “can never be good for our business.”

Meanwhile, Mark Dowds, the co-founder of online insurance platform Trov, which is due to launch in Britain by the end of the year, warned against a possible domino effect of Brexit on the U.K.'s own unity. “I’m based in Belfast, and who knows what Brexit might mean for Northern Ireland or Scotland, for example?” he asked.

The downbeat note was echoed even more starkly by Brett Meyers, CEO of CurrencyFair: “It's the kind of thing we might look back on in 10 years when Europe or the world is at war, and we wonder where it all went wrong ... in one of those signs of the world pulling apart rather than coming together that triggers other more negative events.”",mainstream,M0edc8,big.foot
906,"There are lots of different kinds of personalities in this world and some of them conflict with others. The traits we have tend to fit into these types quite well and really help explain a lot.

If you are an alpha personality type then this article is for you. Alpha personality types tend to be very misunderstood. Sure, alphas are people who are strong and intimidating , but there is a lot more to them than just that. If you’re an alpha, you know the following things are things that tend to get taken in the wrong way.

Just because you’re an alpha doesn’t mean you have to be at the top of your game 24/7. You can and will have your own weak moments as well. If you’re an alpha and someone close to you is having trouble understanding you perhaps sharing this with them will benefit your relationship.

12 Things People Might Not Realize You Do Because You’re An Alpha Person:

1. You keep your close circle small.

Alpha people might be friendly in general and know a lot of people, but they do not let many people get close. They do not trust a lot of people and with good reason. They keep their circle small.

2. You are very to the point when speaking.

When you say something you don’t waste your time sugar coating it. You say exactly what you’re trying to say. You do not beat around the bush.

3. You do not say things that you do not mean.

You are someone that says what you mean. You don’t say things that you don’t mean. You think it all through so that you don’t have to take anything back.

4. You are very confident in your own abilities.

You know that you are capable of a lot of things. You have the sense of self-worth that most others lack. You know that you can do a lot more than other people think and you prove it time and time again.

5. You don’t care what other people say.

You don’t care what other people say or think. You know your own self-worth and that is all you need. You do not let other people define you.

6. You are a very hands-on worker.

You like to be hands-on when it comes to explaining things and working in general. You don’t want to sit behind a desk and waste away. You like to really get out there and put your best foot forward.

7. You pay more attention to actions than words.

You pay a lot more attention to the things people do than the things they say. You don’t let them use you or waste your time. If they say they will do something and refuse to follow through time and time again, you cut ties. We as humans can’t just keep giving chance after chance.

8. You do not have any kind of ‘fear of missing out.’

As an alpha, you know that you’re never missing out on anything. You know that if you want to do something you can go out and do it. Why waste time being afraid of missing out when you can just do what you want to begin with.

9. You are in no way a pushover and stand your ground.

You are not the kind of person to let others walk all over you. If someone bothers you or says something to offend you, you make sure they are aware of it. You do not leave anything to the imagination.

10. You are quite the perfectionist.

You tend to get yourself in trouble sometimes because of this one. You are a perfectionist in most ways. You like for things to be exactly as they should be and refuse to change your mindset no matter what.

People tend to think you are being bossy when really you’re just letting your passionate side come out. You don’t want to upset the people around you, you just want to get things done. You care very strongly about the things that bring out your passion.

12. You tend to be very protective towards your friends and family.

You are someone that other people do not tend to want to offend. You are protective of the people who matter most to you and if someone messes with one of them, they also mess with you. You stand up for the people that mean something to you, big time.",conspiracy,C03710,big.foot
1234,"Since New York City has become the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the US, it has drawn a lot of attention. But it seems that the media and health officials may not be the only ones with their eyes on the Big Apple.

Coinciding with the skyrocketing number of cases of coronavirus in NYC, there has also been an increase in UFO sightings in the skies over Manhattan.

Most recently a Manhattan woman claimed to have spotted a strange UFO hovering over the area. According to the eyewitness, the mysterious object followed her as she was taking her dog for a walk.

The woman, who did not reveal her identity, reported her encounter via the UFO Sightings Daily blog. According to her, she took her dog out for a walk at around 8 o’clock p.m. on the evening of April 21, near the upper west side of New York City.

As she and her dog were walking down the street, she noticed a bright light in the sky. At first, she thought it was an airplane. However, after walking about half a block, she spotted the same bright object in the sky again.

According to the woman, the object did not appear to be moving in a specific direction. Instead, it seemed it was following her as she continued to take her dog for a walk. “I did half [a] block with my dog [and] I stopped again and noticed this light [moved into] position, but [it] was not going in a clear direction,” the woman stated according to UFO Sightings Daily. “When I [started] walking, I noticed this light [was] also moving. When I stopped, the light stopped parallel to me.”

The eyewitness noted that she observed the strange light by walking outside to see if it would still follow her. She said that wherever she went, the object moved in the same direction. The woman said she spent almost an hour walking outside her apartment to observe the strange light’s movements.

Although the video she took is not clear enough to help identify the strange object, it is possible that it was a drone being controlled by someone in the area. It is possible that the person controlling the drone was deliberately following the woman through a mounted camera as a form of a prank, or its movements were purely coincidental.

Various news outlets including CNN and The Hill have reported that drones are sometimes being used in the city to monitor the current lockdown status. Others however, speculate that it is not terrestrial authorities that are monitoring the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, but aliens, who themselves are responsible for the release of the virus, as some kind of precursor to invasion.

Interestingly enough, the increase in UFO sightings in the skies over New York City comes on the heels of the Pentagon recently confirming that three formerly classified videos taken by Navy pilots were officially interactions with “unidentified aerial phenomena.”

382,"COTTON ISLAND, Louisiana (The Town Talk) -- People are still visiting the area where two loggers claim to have seen a Bigfoot creature, but a wildlife agent now says he thinks the reported sightings are a hoax.

""Right now we're treating it as a hoax,"" said Kevin Hill of the state Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.

Despite the likelihood of a hoax, Hill said, the matter is still under investigation by the DWF and Rapides Parish Sheriff's Office.

Meanwhile, the two loggers -- log foreman Earl Whitstine and saw-cutter Carl Michael Dubois, both of Grant Parish -- are sticking tight to their story that they saw a Bigfoot creature in the Cotton Island area of northeast Rapides Parish last week.

Their boss, Joe Delrie, owner of Delrie Wood Products of Colfax, says he believes their tale wholeheartedly, despite others' skepticism about the authenticity of the alleged Bigfoot sightings and tracks found in Boggy Bayou.

Mary Ward, the owner of the land where the reported sightings took place, said around 200 people have come out to her property to view the plaster cast taken from a ""Bigfoot"" footprint and the Boggy Bayou site.

""They all go away pretty well convinced,"" Ward said.

A sign put up over the weekend at the entrance to Ward's property reads ""Big Foot Protection Area."" She said a Bigfoot supporter asked for her permission to place it in that prominent position.

She said visitors are welcome as long as they only shoot with cameras. No guns or dogs allowed.

Whitstine said he saw the unusual creature once on Tuesday morning and again on Thursday while working with Dubois.

Whitstine and Dubois flatly deny they concocted a hoax, saying they had nothing to gain from such a ruse.

""Me and that man (Whitstine) seen what we seen. It was big, hairy and had big feet,"" Dubois said.

The two men were working in the Cotton Island area removing hardwood logs, they said, when the creature made his two appearances.

Whitstine's father, R.C. Whitstine, admitted this week that he was involved in a Bigfoot hoax more than 25 years ago.

Earl Whitstine said that he did not remember the incident well, but did say he didn't believe his father was involved in the hoax where ""Bigfoot"" tracks were discovered near Willianna.

""At the time, they said, 'Somebody like R.C. would do something like that, but he didn't do it,"" Earl Whitstine said.

Earl Whitstine said his family trapped animals for extra holiday money and was in the woods of Grant Parish often.

He believes it was this fact that his father was unfairly pegged as a Bigfoot hoaxer.

But R.C. Whitstine, 76, has admitted sawing a footprint out of plywood to make some tracks.

""We were just having some fun with a new saw,"" he told The Town Talk.

As for the current rash of sightings, Earl Whitstine and Dubois say the creature they saw in the forest was about seven feet tall, covered in black hair and had big feet.

Neither claimed they smelled a foul odor, but a fisherman who also was said to have seen the creature reported it smelled bad.

Whitstine claimed he saw the ""booger"" once on Tuesday morning while operating a tree cutter. He said the sound of the machine's bucket startled the creature, and it ran across a nearby creek and off into the woods.

""After it jumped into the water, it looked back at me,"" Whitstine said.

That would not be the last of Bigfoot, he said.

Two days later, the two loggers were walking along a property line when they came across the strange creature once again, they said. This time it ran away when Whitstine called to it, they said.

It was after that sighting that the tracks were discovered in the dry bayou.

""They can say it was a camel riding an elephant, but I saw what I saw,"" Whitstine said.

Jackie Dubois, Carl Michael's father, was also on the crew that day, and he said he has no doubt that his son saw a strange creature.

""I didn't get to see it, but I wished I could've, but I didn't,"" Jackie Dubois said.

His son has not changed or embellished his story, although he knows people will question their sighting.

""I ain't got nothing to hide,"" Dubois said.

Delrie, owner of the logging company, said Whitstine and Dubois are very trustworthy and honest men who do their job in a professional manner and have been with his company for a number of years.

Delrie said that when Whitstine told him about the Tuesday sighting he believed him but had to have proof.

It was after the sighting on Thursday that the reality of the situation sank in.

""Earl called me up and said, 'I need for you to come down here now,'"" Delrie said.

""I noticed a change in (Whitstine's) voice."" When he came to the scene and saw the tracks, Delrie said, he totally believed that his men had seen a strange creature in those woods.

""I looked around the site to see if it was a prank.

And that six-and-a-half foot stride ... no man could have done that,"" Delrie said.

Delrie said he trusts Whitstine with his expensive logging equipment and that he is lucky to have a solid logging crew working for him.

""The Lord blessed me with them tremendously. You don't know what a (relief) it is knowing they're out there doing their job and doing it well, and I'm not babysitting them,"" Delrie said.

Delrie said his company has a contract with International Paper and that IP officials are strict about who works for them.

""IP said Earl has the No. 1 crew. They love Earl's crew,"" Delrie said.

Ward said at first she wasn't scared living there even after hearing about the sightings of the creature.

But now that the initial excitement has begun to wear off, she said she won't be going into the woods alone anytime soon.

""I'm a little uneasy,"" she said. ""I don't think it'd hurt me, but I know it's there now.""",mainstream,M0908c,big.foot
700,"About 58 years ago, Eisenhower ended his presidency with his famous “Farewell Address to the Nation”…A live broadcast where he warned of the “unwarranted influence sought by the military-industrial complex” – big defense firms who leveraged their political connections for profit.And who tapped their media connections to manufacture enemies and crises – misleading the America public into one war after another. Eisenhower’s warning still rings true today – and the dangers of America being dragged into new wars… for private profits… still exists.

TLB Editors Note: What you are about to read would put any modern day spy or thriller novel plot to shame … It is almost impossible to conceive … never mind believe. We are talking the President of the most powerful nation on the planet vs the most powerful global corporate cabal … No not the Military Industrial Complex … Big Pharma. Most will never have heard or read what is being presented here. The original article was published almost four years ago … its saving grace is its perspective of past events timed in generations, not decades or years ago. We will not bias what is presented here with our own views other than to say … we did feel it important enough to republish it. … but what is presented here stands on its own merit.

But, in the final 60 seconds of his farewell address – a segment previously censored until now…

Ike issues an ominous SECOND warning…A warning most Americans never heard.

The footage of this final segment – and the threat he warns of – has been kept under wraps.

Hidden in the archives of a government building…

And what it says was “off-limits” to the American public for about 58 years.

But I’m breaking this story wide open… naming the big players…and broadcasting Ike’s warning to the public.

Even if the powers-that-be come and shut me down…

Let the chips fall where they may…

In this last minute – the last time Eisenhower would EVER publicly speak – he warned Americans of a far more dangerous threat.

One that could cost even more lives, and do even more damage to America.

In fact, since Ike’s final warning, it’s secretly cost at least 950,000 lives each year…

Lives that could have been easily saved…

And as you’re about to see, it would even claim Eisenhower himself as its FIRST victim…

But the mainstream media censored the final 60 seconds of the famous “Farewell Address”…

They were actively complicit in the “cover up”.

I’ve followed the money trail to their doorsteps.

And my research confirms the media now receives a whopping $27 billion per year for keeping this story quiet.

That’s why it’s remained written out of the textbooks…

Banished from the pages of history…

Today I’m blowing the whistle on this secret plot.

The details of how it took Eisenhower’s life.

But first, let me introduce myself.

For the last 30 years I’ve warned my readers about the dangers of the very threat Eisenhower warned of.

The threat of the “medical industrial complex”.

A group of billion-dollar conglomerates who have literally bought entire departments of the government…

Who manufacture deadly – and highly lucrative – drugs that cost millions of lives each year.

And who have assumed God-like control over America’s healthcare system – and over YOUR life.

You might know them as Big Pharma or the drug industry.

But you just need to know ONE thing:

They make $2 trillion each year, money out of your pocket, for threatening your life, and that of your family.

And they’ve risen to America’s #1 industry on a pile of dead bodies.

About 58 years ago, President Eisenhower saw this coming…

The drug companies were just beginning to consolidate and grab market share during his presidency.

And he tried to get the warning out to the American public – but the media ultimately blocked his efforts.

That’s why few Americans remember this second warning.

A plot that would ultimately create their most lucrative industry.

And they constructed a myth that would aid in this 54-year propaganda campaign.

It all began with the DEATH of President Eisenhower.

On September 24, 1955, President Eisenhower – World War II hero and beloved president – was playing golf at his Denver home, when he suddenly collapsed from what was a rare disease at the time.

Although nobody knew it then… and though you won’t read about it in any history book…

This was a watershed moment that would change the course of modern medicine forever.

One that would make heart disease the #1 killer of Americans – and would establish Big Pharma as America’s #1 most profitable industry.

The story I’m unveiling today has HUGE implications for your personal health, and that of your family.

If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with heart disease, you need to know the exact details of what took place.

Because this story doesn’t just tell you WHO is responsible…

It tells you WHY.
• WHY heart disease rates have soared since 1955 – even as consumption of “heart-healthy” foods and cholesterol-lowering drugs has skyrocketed.
• WHY you could become victim of this drug-induced tragedy – no matter your cholesterol levels or intake of fat.
• And 100 billion reasons why Big Pharma will cure heart disease.

That’s why historian Larry Schweikart calls it “the single most important medical case of the twentieth century.”

Yet the REAL story behind it is virtually unknown.

Within 24 hours of Ike’s heart attack, special interests seized the opportunity.

They shoved this propaganda down the American public’s throat.

And in doing so, they singlehandedly sent America’s health spiraling downhill for the next six decades.

Over the next few minutes, I’ll expose this near-60-year-old Big Pharma conspiracy. I’ll name the names. I’ll track the money. And at each stage, I’ll answer the BIG question: “Who benefits?”

What’s more, I’ll reveal how you can safeguard yourself from heart disease forever with solutions that are 100 percent natural, affordable, effective, and safe.

But before I go into the details of this story any further—how it spun off the #1 heart disease lie, ultimately claiming Eisenhower as its first victim— let me tell you about … Ike’s other warning…

A warning just as ominous for the American public, if not more so.

Near the end of his farewell address to America, Ike warned of the “scientific technological elite.”

These political and scientific insiders were:

They were the new foot soldiers of the “medical-industrial complex.”

A small clique of career-obsessed bureaucrats only interested only in profits.

Their research serves as a marketing tool for highly lucrative drugs.

But it does nothing to improve public health.

Ike saw this development as the end of scientific discovery and curiosity.

You see, during World War II, while then-General Eisenhower was fighting for American freedoms…

A small group of drug companies was working against our freedoms.

They pulled their strings in government.

By the Eisenhower era, the drug industry was dominated by a handful of conglomerates.

A cartel we know today as “Big Pharma.”

And they were already leveraging control of scientific research for massive profits.

Eisenhower undoubtedly saw this trend. As you’re about to see, he even experienced the results personally.

So he knew this would shape America’s health in the decades ahead.

But this part of Ike’s address is all but ignored, censored, and “off-the-record.”

And that’s unfortunate, because it has mushroomed exponentially since that address. Scientists who support “facts” for Big Pharma’s profit – and their own careers – are putting everyday Americans in imminent danger.

That’s why it’s imperative you heed Ike’s warning if you’re concerned about your own health, and that of your family.

The very first victory of this new “scientific technological elite” took place on September 24, 1955 – within 24 hours of Ike’s famous heart attack. It was…

Even though 950,000 people still die every year as a direct result…

And although these deaths are easily preventable…

I doubt one in 10,000 Americans know about September 24, 1955.

The events on this dark day triggered a six-decade propaganda campaign – one that’s misled doctors and scientists to…
• Focus on the WRONG causes of heart disease…
• And instead prescribe dangerous drugs that actually make heart problems worse, alongside 300 other deadly side effects.

After Eisenhower’s heart attack, Big Pharma kicked off their campaign of deception.

Their public relations “experts” immediately appeared on TV and told America a frightening story.

They claimed there was a devastating new “epidemic” of heart disease.

And they blamed excess fat and cholesterol in Americans’ diets.

To confront this “crisis,” they declared a new war.

They labeled ALL fat as evil. Especially saturated fats.

In turn, the “experts” proposed radical changes to the American way of life. They recommended that Americans stop smoking. Engage in 30 minutes of cardio each day. And adopt the “Prudent Diet,” a low-cholesterol diet consisting of corn oil, margarine, chicken, and cold cereal.

What was their real agenda? And who benefited?

According to the Harvard School of Public Health…

But in order to make their new agenda stick, they needed somebody famous as a model for everyday Americans.

And who could fit that bill better than Eisenhower – war hero and beloved president?

As you’re about to see, they not only made Ike the guinea pig for their hypothesis…

They even used the press coverage of Eisenhower’s recovery as free advertising.

Twice each day, for six months, the press covered every aspect of Ike’s recovery – every medicine and every dietary guideline.

They instructed the public on the dangers of coronary disease.

For the first time the word “cholesterol” entered the public vocabulary.

They portrayed cholesterol as the “new polio.”

Millions of Americans – frightened by the new “epidemic” – quickly embraced any solutions the so-called “experts” handed out.

When the dust settled, Americans had learned to watch the fat and cholesterol in their diets.

But there was ONE big problem with all of this…

None of it was true.

Not a single word of it.

In fact, later research would confirm these fats have plenty of proven health benefits, including preventing and reversing heart disease!

But once “facts” like these are born, they never seem to die. No matter the research or studies that disprove them. Not when so much money is at stake.

You see, this myth not only gave birth to poor dietary guidelines…

It also spawned the most lucrative class of drugs ever invented.

That includes the most lucrative (and deadliest) drug known to mankind.

Sales to date from this drug alone have totaled a whopping $140 billion!

And this #1 cash cow hinges on this one single myth.

That’s why it will NOT go away so easily.

Your own doctor likely still believes it.

But I think you’ll be surprised at just how little research there is to back it.

In a minute, you’ll hear all the details on how Ike was its first victim.

But first, let me expose how they used Eisenhower’s own doctor to administer their poison.

Although top scientists and researchers were rallying behind the new myth…

There was ONE detractor:

In fact, he publicly debunked it on a live broadcast in a panel debate with his peers.

Even with NO new research, studies, or trials to support the cholesterol hypothesis…

Dr. White reversed his position, and jumped on the bandwagon for the sake of his own career.

Is it a coincidence Eisenhower’s own doctor was the perfect example of the “scientific-technological elite”?

I’ll leave that for you to decide.

You see, this diet had POWERFUL backers from Big Pharma and Big Agriculture.

Like Procter & Gamble, with billions of dollars on the table selling vegetable oils in place of fat-heavy cooking.

P&G’s funding even helped transform the American Heart Association into a powerhouse organization.

In fact, the AHA’s most avid proponent of the “lipid theory,” Fred Mattson, was a scientist (and shill) for Procter & Gamble.

Mattson even helped P&G develop Olestra, a cholesterol-free replacement for fat in foods and cooking oils.

And in 1958, two years after Eisenhower’s heart attack, Kraft introduced polyunsaturated margarine to the market. A product they advertised as a “heart healthy” alternative to butter.

With this kind of money at stake, the increasingly powerful drug and food conglomerates weren’t taking any chances.

That’s why they hired leading medical experts to tout the new party line.

Today, drug companies STILL recruit “key opinion leaders” as hired guns for their marketing campaigns.

These top physicians endorse Big Pharma’s drugs. In return, they achieve celebrity status and popularity. And they enforce Big Pharma’s ideas in the medical community.

That includes ostracizing and blacklisting doctors who buck the status quo.

These mouthpieces for Big Pharma embody the very “scientific technological elite” that Eisenhower warned of.

Dr. White emerged as one of these leaders in the 1950s.

That’s why he would not only go along with the new dogma…

And aiding in the corruption of medical knowledge…

But would even turn around and prescribe this very same diet to Ike.

Thanks to this single move, the link between cholesterol and heart disease became “gospel.”

Yet not a shred of research supported it.

No studies, no trials, nothing.

Americans swallowed the propaganda like an overpriced pill.

Everyone now “knew” the “evils” of fat and cholesterol in their diets.

Ironically, Eisenhower’s own condition – used by Big Pharma to push their agenda – 100 percent contradicted the “cholesterol myth.”

At the time of his heart attack, Eisenhower’s cholesterol was ONLY 165 mg/dL.

Ike also exercised every day and kept a perfect weight of 172.

In other words, he seemed to be in perfect condition.

And Ike’s case was hardly unusual.

According to a published analysis of the Framingham Heart Study…

75 percent of patients admitted to the hospital for heart attacks have normal cholesterol levels.

In short, cholesterol is a terrible predictor of heart disease.

That should have been the lesson. The end of the story.

But Americans didn’t hear about this from the media.

All they heard was Eisenhower’s new cholesterol-free diet.

Ike replaced butter with hydrogenated soybean oils and margarine full of dangerous trans fat.

He no longer ate eggs, bacon, and steak for breakfast.

And over time, at the insistence of Dr. White, his diet regimen grew stricter.

In fact, some days he would eat nothing but grapefruit and melba toast.

And as a result, Americans jumped on board the new “heart healthy” diet fad.

But this diet came with dire consequences for Ike’s health, mind, and body.

The same suffering millions of Americans would experience over the next 59 years.

According to the Harvard School of Public Health, back in the 1960s when Americans consumed more fat, the rate of obesity was 13 percent and only one percent suffered from type 2 diabetes.

Today, although we consume MUCH less fat in our diets, the rate of obesity has soared as high as 45 percent and 8 percent now suffer from type 2 diabetes.

This is from Harvard University – could you think of a more reliable source?

“The low-fat diet hasn’t helped us control weight or become healthier.”

President Eisenhower’s own experience is a case in point.

After Ike began following this “heart-healthy” diet, his cholesterol levels soared.

They jumped from 165… to 195… to 225… to 259 mg/dL.

The president grew increasingly frustrated, even obsessed with his cholesterol.

At one point he even checked his levels 10 times each year.

The more his cholesterol soared, the more religiously Ike stuck to the diet.

A fact that dumbfounded his team of top physicians and enraged the president.

It got so bad the president’s doctors even started lying to him about his real levels.

Yet this didn’t stop the “experts” from continuing to push this mythology.

Six days before Ike’s cholesterol level reached 259, Ancel Keys – a protégé of Eisenhower’s doctor – published his famous “7 countries study.”

In fact, Dr. Paul Dudley White helped Keys secure government funding for the study.

It championed the same cholesterol-free diet that Eisenhower personally knew was false.

And it established the “lipid hypothesis” as accepted “fact.”

But here’s what no one knew at the time: Ancel Keys “cherry picked” the evidence so he could associate heart disease with fat and cholesterol intake.

Keys studied 22 countries, but only focused on the 6 countries which supported his thesis.

The 16 other countries actually disproved his entire idea… but he left them out.

There’s a word for this kind of research – propaganda.

Nevertheless, the medical world rallied around his theory.

Keys ended up on the cover of Time Magazine.

Two weeks later, the American Heart Association officially adopted the cholesterol theory of heart disease.

Pretty soon, it became the accepted wisdom throughout the medical field.

Lowering LDL (“bad”) cholesterol was now the primary focus of preventive medicine.

The ironic part is, Eisenhower was experiencing firsthand just how wrong this theory was… and paying for it with his health and life.

Throughout the 1960s, Eisenhower suffered seven heart attacks and 14 myocardial infarctions… even as he stuck religiously to the “heart-healthy diet.”

In 1969, the famous war hero and beloved president died from his last heart attack.

In circles today, it’s known as the “Eisenhower Paradox.”

And while this is only a single anecdotal piece of evidence…

The So-Called “Eisenhower Paradox” Is Killing Millions of Average Americans

The medical establishment is still force-feeding us the same myth that ultimately killed Eisenhower.

Remember: the conventional wisdom is that LDL cholesterol causes arterial plaque buildup, ultimately obstructing our blood flow and leading to heart disease.

You’ve heard it. I heard it repeated from elementary to medical school. And like my colleagues, I believed it without question.

That is, until I read thousands of studies proving otherwise.

Yes, LDL cholesterol can be found in the plaque that builds up along damaged arteries.

But this point misses a simple fact – one even a high school physiology course could tell you…

The damage to your arteries happens before NOT after the plaque builds up. Plaque is your body’s response to heart disease, not the cause of it.

LDL cholesterol catches blame because it’s found at the scene of the crime.

But that’s a lot like blaming a scab for the injury that caused it to form… or like blaming a band-aid for the injury its covering.

The truth is that the REAL culprit for heart disease has always been inflammation.

And the worst part is… the inflammation in our blood vessels is caused in part by the low-fat diet recommended for years by modern medicine.

That’s why Eisenhower’s heart disease grew worse, even on his “heart-healthy” diet… which replaced so-called “artery-clogging” butter with toxic vegetable oils.

And that’s why 950,000 Americans continue to die each year from heart disease, even as they consume record quantities of low-fat food, vegetable oils, and cholesterol-lowering drugs.

In fact, the truth about inflammation is old news. But the medical establishment still ignores it. Even when the mainstream media occasionally gets it right.

For instance, a 2004 Time Magazine cover story identified inflammation as the “secret killer.” Take a look at the cover…

The Time article starts with a description of the conventional explanation of heart disease.

Then the writer quickly shuts it down….

But I was stunned that this blunt article actually reached the mainstream.

Of course, this was more than 10 years ago. And in spite of the attention generated by this article, the market for cholesterol-lowering drugs to counteract heart disease has skyrocketed five-fold since then.

In short, there’s nothing stopping Big Pharma’s relentless march for profits… no amount of evidence… no matter how airtight… even from a prestigious source like Time Magazine.

Their profit margins trump proof. And it certainly trumps your health and your life.

You don’t have to fall victim to their mass guinea pig experiment.

I’ve identified three urgent indicators of heart disease you can check with a simple blood test.

These tests indicate (with startling accuracy) that you could be at imminent risk of a heart attack or stroke.

In fact, one of these indicators can predict when that risk may jump by as much as 500 percent.

A review of 26 articles, published in the Journal of Biotechnology Information, proved even a very tiny increase in levels – 5 mcg – confirms a 20 percent increase in heart disease risk … independent of ANY other factors for heart disease.

And I can speak from personal experience as a physician.

390,"Take a look at some of the biggest movers in the premarket:

Deere (DE) – The construction equipment maker reported fiscal second-quarter earnings of $2.11 per share, compared to the consensus estimate of $1.62 a share. Revenue beat estimates as well. Deere said it expects global equipment sales to fall 30% to 40% this year as the Covid-19 pandemic weighs on demand.

Alibaba (BABA) – The China-based e-commerce giant beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines for its fiscal fourth quarter, and topped $1 trillion in gross merchandise volume for the first time in the just-concluded fiscal year. Alibaba benefited from an increase in online shopping due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Foot Locker (FL) – Foot Locker lost 67 cents per share for its latest quarter, wider than the 25 cents a share loss that Wall Street was expecting. The athletic footwear and apparel retailer's revenue also missed estimates, with comparable sales plunging a wider-than-expected 42.8%. Foot Locker has also temporarily suspended its quarterly dividend.

Lululemon (LULU) – Lululemon said it has reopened more than 150 of its retail locations, with the athletic apparel maker planning to reopen about 200 more stores over the next two weeks. It has instituted a new set of reopening guidelines, including enhanced cleaning, modified hours, and limits to the number of customers in a store at any one time.

Palo Alto Networks (PANW) – Palo Alto reported quarterly earnings of $1.17 per share, compared to a consensus estimate of 94 cents a share. The cybersecurity company's revenue also beat Wall Street forecasts, and it said it will benefit from a continued increase in remote working.

Nvidia (NVDA) – Nvidia beat estimates by 11 cents a share, with quarterly earnings of $1.80 per share. The graphics chipmaker's revenue also beat forecasts. Nvidia gave an upbeat forecast, on surging demand for its chips that are used in data centers.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) – Hewlett Packard Enterprise fell 7 cents a share short of estimates, with quarterly earnings of 22 cents per share. The enterprise cloud computing company's revenue also fell short, with HPE's business impacted significantly by the coronavirus outbreak. The company also unveiled a cost-cutting plan designed to save at least $1 billion by 2022.

Alphabet (GOOGL) – Proxy adviser ISS recommended that shareholders vote against executive pay proposals at the Google parent's annual meeting in June. ISS criticized the proposals as ""outsized awards that are not sufficiently performance-based.""

Splunk (SPLK) – Splunk reported a quarterly loss of 56 cents per share, a penny a share smaller than Wall Street had expected. Revenue came in short of forecasts, but the maker of data analytics software said it expected stronger demand for its cloud services as more people shift to working from home.

IBM (IBM) – IBM will cut an unspecified number of jobs, the first workforce reduction under new CEO Arvind Krishna, who took over from Ginni Rometty earlier this year. A person familiar with IBM's plans told The Wall Street Journal that several thousand workers are likely to be affected.

e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) – The company doubled Wall Street expectations with quarterly earnings of 10 cents per share. The cosmetics retailer's revenue also topped estimates. The company said the pandemic has impacted its sales, and it expects continued negative impact until consumers return to normal shopping patterns.

Ross Stores (ROST) – Ross Stores reported a quarterly loss of 87 cents per share, surprising analysts who had expected a profit of 3 cents per share. The discount retailer's revenue also fell short of estimates as the coronavirus outbreak forced it to close stores, but Ross did say it began reopening stores last week.

Deckers (DECK) – Deckers earned 57 cents per share for its fiscal fourth quarter, well above the 9 cents a share consensus estimate. The maker of UGG boots and Teva sandals posted revenue that came in above forecasts, although it said it is facing challenges due to virus-related store shutdowns. Deckers is not providing guidance for the current fiscal year due to uncertainty surround the pandemic's impact.",mainstream,M0fad4,big.foot

Henry VIII reportedly had gout, as did Louis XIV. Gout surrounds us in 21st century Britain, too. In fact, it is getting worse. According to Arthritis Care, it affects 1 in 40 people in the UK and since 1997 there has been a 30 per cent increase in gout cases. The number is increasing by 1.5 per cent every year.

Why? ""It’s probably because people are getting heavier and not moving around so much,"" says Judi Rhys, chief executive of the UK charity Arthritis Care. ""We know there’s a link between gout and being overweight.""

594,"BIGFOOT has long been thought of as a potential 'missing link' between apes and humans and now scientists think they've found evidence of an ""original"" version of the mythical creature.

A new study proposes that the 'original Bigfoot' was a 10-foot tall ape that roamed the Earth two million years ago.

Archaeological evidence of the creature has been found in southeastern China.

It is being referred to as Gigantopithecus blacki or G. blacki for short.

It's being likened to modern-day orangutans.

The researchers found that G. Blacki is actually related to orangutans by conducting a new kind of protein analysis on some of the tooth enamel from fossilised remains.

Study co-author Enrico Cappellini explained: ""By sequencing proteins retrieved from dental enamel about 2 million years old, we showed it is possible to confidently reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of animal species that went extinct too far away in time for their DNA to survive till now.

""In this study, we can even conclude that the lineages of orangutan and Gigantopithecus split up about 12 million years ago.""

The researchers have worked out that G. blacki likely weighed up to 595 pounds and diverged from orangutans around 12 million years ago.

However, it's not thought to be closely related to humans.

The study's lead author Frido Welker said: ""With this study, we show that we can use protein sequencing to retrieve ancient genetic information from primates living in subtropical areas even when the fossil is two million years old.

""Until now, it has only been possible to retrieve genetic information from up to 10,000-year-old fossils in warm, humid areas.

""This is interesting, because ancient remains of the supposed ancestors of our species, Homo sapiens, are also mainly found in subtropical areas, particularly for the early part of human evolution.

""This means that we can potentially retrieve similar information on the evolutionary line leading to humans.""

Fossils of the 'original Bigfoot' are very rare and only four parital jaws have ever been found.

However, thousands of teeth have been discovered.

We don't know for sure what G. blacki would have looked like but some artistic impressions depict the species as an oversized orangutan.

This study has been published in the scientific journal Nature.

861,"Finally, there's the foot. ""What's important here is the arch,"" Lovejoy says. ""It's a really important shock absorber. It's like wearing a good pair of running shoes."" In order to create that arch, the chimp's opposable great toe became aligned with the others, and the toe's muscles and ligaments, which had been used for grasping and climbing, were repositioned under the foot. ""The shape of the big toe is indicative of this. You can see it in Lucy's species,"" Lovejoy says, but not in the bone Haile-Selassie found, because it's from a different toe. ""What we can see [in the new discovery's foot] is that the base of the bone adjacent to the knuckle has a distinct angle, showing that the creature walked step after step after step with its heel off the ground, using the front of its foot as a platform.""

That's how it walked. Why it walked is tougher to understand, since motivation leaves behind no physical remains. But armed with knowledge about our ancestors' physical attributes and the environment that surrounded them, scientists have come up with several theories. Anthropologist Henry McHenry, of the University of California, Davis, for example, champions the idea that climate variation was part of the picture after all. When Africa dried out, say McHenry and his colleague Peter Rodman, the change left patches of forest widely spaced between open savannah. The first hominids lived mostly in these forest refuges but couldn't find enough food in any one place. Learning to walk on two legs helped them travel long distances over ground to the next woodsy patch, and thus to more food.

Meave Leakey, head of paleontology at the National Museums of Kenya and a member of the world's most famous fossil-hunting family, suspects the change in climate rewarded bipedalism for a different reason. Yes, the dryer climate made for more grassland, but our early ancestors, she argues, spent much of their time not in dense forest or on the savannah but in an environment with some trees, dense shrubbery and a bit of grass. ""And if you're moving into more open country with grasslands and bushes and things like this, and eating a lot of fruits and berries coming off low bushes, there is a hell of an advantage to be able to reach higher. That's why the gerenuk [a type of antelope] evolved its long neck and stands on its hind legs, and why the giraffe evolved its long neck. There's strong pressure to be able to reach a wider range of levels.""

But for Kent State's Lovejoy, the real answer is sex. Males who were best at walking upright would get more of it, leading to more offspring who were good on two legs, who in turn got more sex. His reasoning, first proposed nearly two decades ago, goes like this: like many modern Americans, monkeys and apes of both genders work outside the home--in the latter case, searching for food. Early humans, though, discovered the Leave It to Beaver strategy: if males handled the breadwinning, females could stay closer to home and devote more time to rearing the children, thus giving them a better shot at growing up strong and healthy.",mainstream,M07aea,big.foot
843,"It's supposed to be a mythical creature hiding somewhere in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, but has Bigfoot finally been captured on video in Indonesia?

Footage shot in the south east Asian country appears to show an enormous creature walking upright through a waterfall and rolling green hillside.

While on the somewhat distorted clip it can't be determined exactly what the creature is, some conspiracy theorists are believing it may finally be the real deal.

The video begins with a wide shot of a stunning Indonesian mountain range.

All appears still and quiet until suddenly there's movement to the left of a waterfall.

What looks to be the large Bigfoot emerges out of nowhere, walking in front of the cascading water.

After just a short few seconds the large figure - which appears to be glistening in the sun - disappears from view, but is incredibly forever recorded on camera.

While the Daily Star reports that some think the video is legitimate, others are a bit more skeptical.

Some believe that judging from the height of the creature in comparison to the waterfall, the video is just one of hundreds of fakes littered across the internet.

It is unclear when the legend of Bigfoot, also called Sasquatch, was first created, however most sightings are attributed to being black bears.

979,"Earlier this month, the Internet erupted with whispers about the potential reemergence of the Tasmanian tiger, an animal believed to have gone extinct in 1936. The excitement was spurred by the Australian government’s recent release of a list of alleged Tasmanian tiger sightings from the past three years.

For Forrest Galante, this is an animal he has been thinking about for years. The biologist turned adventurer is the star of Animal Planet’s Extinct or Alive, a nature show that seeks out animals that science has proclaimed extinct.

“I spent three months in the Australian bush looking for it, I have faith in that animal’s existence,” Galante tells PEOPLE. And even though those three months didn’t turn up a Tasmanian Tiger, also known as a thylacine, he hasn’t “given up hope yet” that the animal is out there.

Galante’s opinion is one to be trusted, he and the Extinct or Alive crew have already uncovered species that the world literally left for dead, including the rediscovery of the Fernandina Giant Tortoise.

“We find one of these animals and it’s earth-shattering. It rewrites natural history,” Galante says adding that he sees each of Extinct or Alive‘s rediscoveries as an “accomplishment for the world of conservation.”

“The fact that these animals are able to hang on by a thread when the whole world has given up on them — I am getting goosebumps,” he says of the feeling he gets holding an animal in his hands that the world thought was extinct.

Galante, the son of safari owners, has spent his whole life around wildlife and, after becoming a biologist, decided to share his excitement about his work through media. This is how Extinct or Alive was born.

The show follows Galante through wild and remote locations in search of animals that are thought to be extinct. The job is anything but guess work. Each episode consists of years of research, months of planning and weeks of field works. Galante says he receives at least 100 messages a week from fans and fellow animal lovers with tips, sightings and requests to search for certain animals, Big Foot included. And while Galante doesn’t seek out cryptids like Big Foot, he does read and log every message he gets, just in case any can bring him a step closer to uncovering an animal the world has forgotten.

Even after all this work and preparation, there are still plenty of trips when all the effort doesn’t lead to a rediscovery, but Galante doesn’t consider these adventures to be failures.

“We make a very family friendly show. We don’t always find the animal, but we do find amazing habitats and other amazing species,” he says. “People can enjoy the adventure and all the beautiful creatures along the way.”

Viewers can also enjoy missing out on the unique pains Galante and his team endure while out in the field searching for extinct animals. According to Galante, while working on the show, he has gotten used to getting 45 bee stings a day, been bitten by a shark, worked in 122 degree weather near an active volcano, spent days in darkness and gone into anaphylactic shock from a wasp sting.

To him it is all worth it, but he understands if there are people at home who prefer to assist in conservation in a different way.

“Conservation starts at home. Wildlife is all around us,” Galante says. To those who are inspired by what he does, but aren’t looking for a shark bite, he advises joining a conservation group in your area, volunteering at a local rescue or donating to nonprofits that help protect our planet and its animals.",mainstream,M0cd85,big.foot
1151,"Few things are greater levellers than a pair of feet, as proved by the Duchess of Sussex, who allegedly runs a mile if anyone tries to film her bunions. In a 2015 shoot for a now-defunct fashion website, her entourage is said to have sent a videographer packing after he began taking supplemental footage of her feet.

“I understand she hates her feet,” explained a colleague of the man in question in a newspaper article earlier this week. “When he did that, they all looked at him like ‘what the hell are you doing?'’ and said, ‘you're done for today'’.

Meghan is not alone, however, in her foot phobia. According to podiatrist Margaret Dabbs, the Queen of Feet who counts Graham Norton, Ozwald Boateng, and numerous City highflyers as clients, many women feel self-conscious about the appearance of their feet, insecurity that is only made worse by the current trend for sandals and open-toed shoes. “They try to hide their feet away; they don’t realise there are always ways to improve the situation through treatment and exercise,” she says.

Our feet end up being a neglected part of our body but we should all be giving them more attention, Dabbs maintains. Evidence suggests that in some cases Covid-19 presents itself on the feet; GPs are allegedly overrun with concerns about “Covid toe”; red blotches and lesions on the toes and feet that are thought to be another side effect of the virus. “The rash seems to resemble pernio erythema or chilblains and is presumably related to change in body temperature,” Dabbs says. “Viral conditions often affect the extremities and that can include toes.”

Our isolated lifestyle is also playing havoc with our feet. With gyms closed and many of our daily commutes cancelled, we are more static than usual, leaving us at risk of painful conditions such as Plantar fasciitis, which can stem from inactivity, Dabb says.

Others, meanwhile, have become mad runners, haring off on the 5Km Run for Heroes with precious little training. According to Dabbs, extreme exercise without giving any thought to our feet can result in thickened skin, flattened arches, stress fractures and Achilles tendonitis.

The easiest way to start noticing our feet is to strip off our shoes and socks, says postural alignment therapist, Ellie Burt, and walk around on them. “It’s no good working out our bodies without thinking about our feet,” she says. “The foot muscles might be tiny but they are crucial to a fully functioning, pain-free body; some muscles such as the Gastrocnemius start at the foot and span all the way up behind the knee.”

This enforced rest from heeled work shoes is an ideal opportunity to give our feet a chance to recover and wake up, she continues. Heels and indeed any shoe including trainers that tilts our ankles downwards, throw off the biomechanics of the entire body, and load our feet unnaturally, causing problems in joints further up the body.

Don’t be tempted to ditch your trainers entirely, though, warns Dabbs. If you’re a perpetual heel wearer like Meghan, you should gradually build up the time you spend barefoot or risk ending up with Achilles tendonitis. It’s also a good idea to introduce some barefoot exercises; for those with flat feet, Dabbs’ son James Dabbs, a personal trainer who runs online fitness classes to strengthen the foot as well as the rest of the body, suggests introducing exercises that work on raising, strengthening and lengthening the arches –stair arch raises, calf raises, arch lifts and tennis ball rolls. Pregnancy, ageing, footwear, gait and genetics can all contribute to flat feet, he says, but with regular exercise, you can strengthen your arches and reduce pain in other joints.",mainstream,M09035,big.foot
1201,"According to the Cambridge Dictionary, a concentration camp is defined as “a place where large numbers of people are kept as prisoners in extremely bad conditions, especially for political reasons.” It is undeniable that the Rukban camp fits this definition to the letter.

DAMASCUS, SYRIA — The United States military has rejected offers to resolve the growing humanitarian crisis in the Rukban refugee camp in Syria, which sits inside a 55 km zone occupied by the U.S. along the Syria-Jordan border. The U.S. has also refused to let any of the estimated 40,000 refugees — the majority of which are women and children — leave the camp voluntarily, even though children are dying in droves from lack of food, adequate shelter and medical care. The U.S. has also not provided humanitarian aid to the camp even though a U.S. military base is located just 20 km (12.4 miles) away.

The growing desperation inside the Rukban camp has received sparse media coverage, likely because of the U.S.’ control over the area in which the camp is located. The U.S. has been accused of refusing to let civilians leave the area — even though nearly all have expressed a desire to either return to Syrian government-held territory or seek refuge in neighboring countries such as Turkey — because the camp’s presence helps to justify the U.S.’ illegal occupation of the area.

Though the U.S. has long justified its presence in al-Tanf as necessary to defeat Daesh (ISIS), the U.S. government has also acknowledged that al-Tanf’s true strategic importance lies in U.S. efforts to “contain” Iran by blocking a connection from Iran to Syria through Iraq. Al-Tanf lies near the area where the borders of Syria, Iraq and Jordan meet. Thus, in the U.S.’ game of brinkmanship with Iran, Rukban’s estimated 40,000 inhabitants have become pawns whose basic needs are ignored by their occupiers.

U.S. shows no interest in meeting

On Tuesday, delegations from Russia, Syria, the UN, and the Rukban refugee camp met to discuss the fate of the camp’s inhabitants after a UN survey found that 95 percent of the camp’s inhabitants wanted to leave the camp, while 83 percent wanted to return to their hometowns in areas of Syria now under Syrian government control.

However, the U.S. military and State Department officials in nearby Jordan rejected an invitation to Tuesday’s meeting. The U.S. military also prohibited a Syrian-Russian delegation from entering the Rukban camp on Tuesday. The delegation had sought to assess conditions in the camp, which have become increasingly desperate according to reports from a variety of outlets, including U.S. government-funded outlets like Voice of America.

The U.S.’ refusal to attend the meeting or allow the delegation passage comes less than a month after the U.S. military blocked the entry of evacuation buses overseen by Russian and Syrian forces that would have allowed refugees to leave the camp.

The buses would have entered through the “humanitarian corridors” that were recently opened on the Syrian-controlled side of the U.S.-occupied enclave. While camp inhabitants can, in theory, leave the camp through the corridors on foot, the barren area’s remoteness makes such evacuations unfeasible without vehicle transport. Although some families have left this way, the lack of record keeping within the camp has made it impossible to know how many have tried leaving this way since the corridors were opened last month.

An often overlooked problem that has prevented them from leaving is that U.S.-backed and U.S.-trained “moderate rebel” groups have been known to block camp inhabitants from leaving, demanding large payments in U.S. dollars to leave the area. The U.S. military took control of Al-Tanf alongside “moderate” rebel forces in 2014 after wresting the area from Daesh. Many of those opposition groups have since been revealed to have ties and sympathies to terrorist groups, including Daesh.

The U.S. has not given a reason for its rejection of Tuesday’s meeting and had previously said that its rejection of the evacuation buses was based on its view that the buses did not meet the U.S.’ “protection standards.”

While the U.S. has claimed that it has blocked refugees from leaving on Russian-Syrian buses are under U.S. “protection,” it has done little to abet the suffering of the tens of thousands of civilians in Rukban, even though the area is under complete U.S. military control and a U.S. military base is just a few miles away. Indeed, the extent of U.S. “aid” to the Rukban camp has been medical training of the handful of nurses in the camp, who work in conditions they describe as being like “the Stone Age” owing to the chronic lack of basic medications and doctors.

While medical care is decidedly lacking, the most pressing problem is the access to food, as starvation has become a real threat for those living in Rukban. Last October the opposition-aligned news service, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), reported that the Rukban camp had been without food or essential supplies for months. Only two aid deliveries, managed jointly by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) and the UN, were able to enter the camp.

One of those shipments, however, almost didn’t happen after the UN delayed the aid “for logistical and security reasons.” While the UN did not specify which “security reasons” had prompted the delay, it was apparently not the Syrian government, as the UN also said in the same statement that the convoy had received approval from Damascus. This suggests that the “security” concerns were related to U.S.-backed militants in the U.S.-controlled area surrounding al-Tanf. Notably, Russian and Syrian sources have claimed that these same militants often “plunder” the aid intended for the camp’s inhabitants for themselves.

Since then, the situation inside the camp has continued to deteriorate. Indeed, things have gotten so desperate that, in January, a mother attempted to set herself and her three children on fire after she couldn’t find food for three straight days and preferred to give her children a quick death rather than watch them starve. Others in the camp rescued the family, though the mother and her infant were seriously injured. Recently aid from the UN and SARC arrived in early February, the first aid shipment in over three months.

The lack of food combined with the lack of medical care has been responsible for scores of deaths in the camp — the majority of which are of children under the age of two, who often die from malnutrition and preventable diseases. Others have died from freezing weather owing to a lack of adequate shelter, with eight children dying in January for that very reason. Satellite images taken of the camp in early March showed the recent creation of a mass grave containing an estimated 300 bodies adjacent to the camp.

Despite the desperate conditions less than 13 miles from its military base, the U.S. has declined to send food, doctors, medical supplies or other forms of aid to Rukban’s inhabitants, while also preventing them from leaving. However, the U.S. has been providing militant groups in the same area with military and logistical support.

In addition to presiding over the squalid and starvation conditions in the Rukban camp, the U.S. has also given militant groups present in the area it controls — including Daesh terrorists who have “embedded” themselves in the camp on the U.S.’ watch — free rein to terrorize the camp’s refugees. These militant groups not only control the flow of food and aid in the camp but terrorize its most vulnerable inhabitants, forcing women and children into sex slavery and engaging in human trafficking. All of this is taking place in a “deconfliction zone” controlled by the U.S. military.

These extremist groups, including Daesh, are well-armed, according to Jordanian Brigadier General Sami Kafawin, who told NBC News in 2017 that these groups “have whole weapons systems … small arms, RPGs, anti-aircraft.”

The official reason for the U.S. base in al-Tanf has long been counterterrorism operations that ostensibly target Daesh. However, very few attacks against the terror group have been launched from this base and a UN report released last August found that Daesh had been given “breathing space” in U.S.-occupied areas of Syria, including al-Tanf. The U.S. has stated that it uses the al-Tanf base to train Syrian opposition fighters who then control the area around the base, including Rukban.

With the U.S. now having claimed that Daesh has been completely defeated in Syria, the official justification for its illegal occupation of Syrian territory is wearing thin. With that justification now on shaky ground, the U.S. is increasingly having to acknowledge its main motive for its presence in al-Tanf — containing Iran and keeping Syria divided.

Indeed, a recent Reuters article notes that the U.S.-controlled area around al-Tanf that includes the Rukban camp “is designed to shield U.S. troops at the Tanf garrison and maintain for Washington a strategic foothold in an area close to a crucial supply route for Iranian weapons entering Syria from Iraq.” This was confirmed by General Joseph Votel late last year when he told NBC News that the U.S. base in al-Tanf was key in countering “the sway of Iran” in Syria.

This followed statements made last July by National Security Advisor John Bolton that U.S. troops would remain in Syria “as long as the Iranian menace continues throughout the Middle East.” This policy of Iran containment has clearly guided U.S. policy in Syria of late, with at least 1,000 U.S. troops set to stay in Syria illegally despite Daesh’s defeat and President Donald Trump’s recent calls for a troop withdrawal.

The U.S. has been accused of using the civilians trapped in Rukban as a “shield” for its continued operations in Syria aimed at containing Iran’s regional influence. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said earlier this month that “the fact that people are not allowed to leave [the camp] and are held hostage makes one suggest that the U.S. needs this camp to continue justifying its illegitimate presence there.” There appear to be few other explanations for the U.S.’ refusal to let camp inhabitants leave the area.

The hypocrisy of U.S. “humanitarian concerns”

The situation in the Rukban camp reveals the dark reality behind the U.S.’ occupation of Syrian territory in Al-Tanf and elsewhere. In order to pursue its policy of Iran “containment” and a divided and partitioned Syria, the U.S. is willing to imprison some 40,000 people — many of them children — in a concentration camp where international aid is blocked and where food is so scarce that mothers are setting themselves and their children on fire so they can avoid slowly starving to death.

According to the Cambridge Dictionary, a concentration camp is defined as “a place where large numbers of people are kept as prisoners in extremely bad conditions, especially for political reasons.” It is undeniable that the Rukban camp fits this definition to the letter.

That the U.S. justifies its aggressive policies around the world — from Syria to Venezuela and elsewhere — as being motivated by “humanitarian concerns” — when a refugee camp under the U.S.’ complete control in Syria is facing starvation conditions and its inhabitants are being forcefully kept confined in the camp by the U.S. military despite their expressed desire to leave — is an obscene Orwellian twist.

 Melee Massacre

 As U.S. troops attempt to disarm a band of Hunkpapa and Miniconjou Indians at a camp on South Dakota's Wounded Knee Creek on December 29, 1890, a single rifle shot rings out. In short order the 7th Cavalry—there to arrest Big Foot, a leader of the Ghost Dance movement feared by whites to be inciting rebellion—opens fire on the camp with rifles and Hotchkiss guns. More than 150 Indian men, women and children and 25 Army soldiers are killed in the last major confrontation between Indians and soldiers in the West.

 Expectations Fulfilled 

 Charles Dickens publishes the first installment of Great Expectations in his weekly magazine All the Year Round, December 1, 1860. Building the novel of class and ambition on a ""fine new and grotesque idea""—the unexpected tie between Pip, the orphan narrator, and the convict Magwitch—he adds such indelible characters as the unrelentingly bridal Miss Havisham. A popular success, the autobiographical novel—now considered among Dickens' best—saves the financially troubled magazine, and when published as a book in 1861, sells out three editions in a month.

363,"Finding Bigfoot is an American television series on Animal Planet. It premiered on May 29, 2011. The program follows four researchers and explorers investigating potential evidence of Bigfoot, a cryptid hominid allegedly living in the wildernesses of the United States and Canada. While the Finding Bigfoot team never captured photographic evidence of the creature's existence, the show gained high ratings and was a top earner for Animal Planet. The series finale and the 100th episode was released on May 27, 2018.

The team consists of Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO) founder and President Matt Moneymaker, researchers James ""Bobo"" Fay and Cliff Barackman, and skeptical scientist Ranae Holland. The series never questions the existence of bigfoot, but rather documents the team's search efforts and study of potential evidence in an attempt to prove the existence of the creature.

Over the course of the series, the team has introduced many new bigfoot related terms into the American vernacular. For example, the term ""bigfoot"" is rarely used in favor of ""squatch"" (short for sasquatch). Their investigations are referred to as ""squatchin'"". The areas they investigate are often described as ""Squatchy"", with Washington having been described as ""the squatchiest state.""

An episode begins with the Finding Bigfoot team driving to a location on the trail of photographic, video, audio, or eyewitness evidence of a Bigfoot. The team will go to the location where the evidence was gathered from, and speak to the person who gathered the evidence. If it is a photograph or a video, the team will perform a recreation and a size comparison of the event, using the same camera that the witness used. The team then performs their first night investigation at that same location.

Starting with the second season, one member of the team will almost always remain at the location for a solo night investigation for several more nights. The other three (or four in the first season) members will then head to a 'town hall meeting' to which members of the public are invited to come and share their Bigfoot encounter stories. In some heavily Bigfoot reported areas, such as Washington, these events are sometimes invite only.

After the witnesses tell their encounter stories, they are asked to mark their sighting locations on a map, which the team then uses to look for a pattern of sightings. The team will then visit three of the best-reported encounters, that are usually close to one another. After visiting all three witnesses, the team will collect the member who was doing the solo night investigation and select an area to do their final night investigation.

For the final night investigation, the team usually devises a unique plan to try to attract a Bigfoot, usually involving noise or light, by using boats on a lake, or silent electric ATVs. They also do wood knocks, which mimics the bigfoot's supposed communication. Night-vision technology and forward looking infrared (FLIR) cameras are used to document these investigations. They will then evaluate what they learned and announce their evaluations during the ending credits. Occasionally, they will show their trail cam pictures or DNA results following the credits/summary.

In the third season, the team expanded their search from North America to investigate the Sasquatch phenomenon known as ""yowies"" in Australia. Later in the season, they traveled to Indonesia searching for the ""orang pendek"", and to Vietnam to search for the ""wildman"".[7] In season four, the team traveled to China in search of the ""yeren"", and Nepal in search of the ""yeti"". In later seasons, the team traveled to other countries, including the United Kingdom and Brazil.

Season 5 of Finding Bigfoot debuted on June 8, 2014, as opposed to November when the last two seasons started.

On October 20, 2017, the Finding Bigfoot cast and crew revisited California to attend the 50th anniversary festival while filming the 100th episode of the show.

On May 27, 2018, the 100th and finale episode was released on Animal Planet. It was entitled ""Return of the Legend"".

Animal Planet has received criticism for Finding Bigfoot and Mermaids: The Body Found[8] for their ""outlandishness"", however, Fay is quick to defend Finding Bigfoot, and to draw a line between the two programs. ""You can't equate bigfoot with mermaids.""[9]

Several episodes of the first season received heavy criticism from the four 'Finding Bigfoot' members themselves, for the editing style that Animal Planet used, to make it appear that a horse and a person were unidentified by the team, and what they were remained unknown. The second event, involving the horse, led the team to threaten to quit the show if such techniques were used again.[10]

Regardless, Finding Bigfoot is one of Animal Planet's top rated programs.[11] It has spawned two spin-offs: Finding Bigfoot: Further Evidence and Finding Bigfoot: Rejected Evidence. Finding Bigfoot: Further Evidence is similar to VH-1's Pop-Up Video. Episodes of Finding Bigfoot are re-aired with ""info nuggets"" from the team members. Finding Bigfoot: Rejected Evidence is an online-only series, in which executive producer Keith Hoffman airs video deemed not worthy of inclusion on the show.[12]

Bigfoot enthusiasts have often ridiculed the show, due to the team's consistent lack of success, and the fact that any footage of a Bigfoot would be reported long before an episode airs.[13]",mainstream,M12a1f,big.foot

³At age 15, Creighton had an apparition of a Black Angel¹ who possessed him as an 'Angel of Death¹: I awoke in the middle of the night, soaked in sweat and there he was, standing at the foot of my bed . . . I could not move. With a feeling of utter degradation and terror I realized I was powerless to stop him possessing me -- as he would often do in the weeks, months and years that followed.""





 ³Sounds like Creighton was the victim of a pedophile?² ³That Black Angel was probably Morton.² ³It's possible that some Section M agents may have been mind controlled sex

slaves.² (From Makow, ""Martin Bormann Was a Rothschild Agent--Damning Evidence"") 



Take a big jump.



 Creighton was dealing with international events that would change the course

of history. Those boys are very often body-jumped by Anubis. Anubis is the

original entity, around 5000 years old, first recorded pre-Egyptian around

32000 BC.



 Creighton clearly describes body-jumping: ""who possessed me . . . I could not

move . . . I was powerless to stop him possessing me . . . often do in the

weeks, months and years that followed.""



 Whether you're working on a good mission or a bad mission, Anubis appears as

the angle of death, as cold as space, heavy breathing, ultimately the

possessor, the body-jumper. Ultimately Anubis appears to, and body-jumps,

those who will change world events. He is not your séance dude.



 As for the connection between ""Black Angel/Angel of Death/Anubis and victim

of a pedophile/Morton/mind controlled sex slaves"" . . . they don¹t exist.



 Nor is Black Angel/Angel of Death/Anubis to be confused with Incubus or

Succubus ­ getting young girls pregnant, and giving small boys blows.



 I¹ve just been on the morphine for kidney stones, so I¹ll claim that as

cover.



 HALLETT'S EXPERIENCE 



I had similar training to Creighton/Ainsworth-Davis with the Black Angel/Anubis. Mine also started around 14/15. At 18, while at University, I was fully body-jumped (1980) and by 1983, I was body-jump capable.



 Some of the horrific training occurs naturally under Anubis. The most

information inserted at the deepest level in the quickest time is done

through the most intense fear. I call this 'internal terror¹.



 The five minutes I spent battling with Anubis over possession of my body was

cover for an internal download.



 These downloads, which Creighton also had, work on the subconscious level .

. . meaning you attract everything you need to achieve those goals. That

 includes the training, the trainers, the support crew, the opportunities,

the job as cover, the transport and accommodation and the chance meetings.

It also means that you can act as an independent and run your own constructs

(frame of reference). That means you don¹t need to report back to a

controller or ultimately rely on another crew.



As it turned out, the reconstruction of the subconscious was one of the most

valuable things to come out of the Cold War. It was something we ultimately

had delivered from Moscow.



 Just as Creighton¹s role was getting the US into WWII with Pearl Harbor, and

getting Bormann out of Berlin, my role, with similar experiences, was

finishing Creighton/Ainsworth¹s story with the escape of Hitler out of



 Berlin with the attached Operation Winnie the Pooh . . . and dropping the

Berlin Wall.



MARKUS WOLFE





Anubis is 'Man with Wolfe¹s head' ­ hence Mark as Wolfe¹ 'Marcus Wolfe' ­-the head of the STASI. He was very easy to body jump. Just look at the photos of him around 21 -- very open.Anyway, we spent around a year setting it up. I got into the Ivy League CIA on the reincarnation ticket in Boston and they took care of contacts, accommodation and transport. I made some KGB contacts and I was skipping between Checkpoint Charlie between the two groups.Somehow we managed to arrange:1. A prostitute (Russian);2. Lots of Alcohol;3. Body-jump;4. Construct, or Frame of reference. These are kind of like secret formulasfor the subconscious, like the parallel program, the main program, thesabotage program and the homeopathic program. These are the sort of thingsI¹d explain to Carl Jung. Part of the construct we used included me skippingthrough Checkpoint Charlie at exactly midnight the year before the wall camedown, like on 8/9 November 1988.So a year later, Marcus Wolfe tells his wife he¹s going out of town on abusiness trip for a week, but he stayed in Berlin with this new mistress andgets really drunk, standing around bragging in his underwear. His first wifewas also his mistress, so he had a weakness here.He¹s been at it for a few days, and he¹s like butter. There¹s some pressureat the gates to open them for humans from East to West, so the guard ringsup and asks for Marcus, then says, no, where Marcus is, not where he¹s not,at his relaxing place. The guard gets put through to Marcus Wolfe and briefshim on the situation, on the pressure at the gates and they discuss openingthe dog gates to get the dogs to scatter the people.Marcus Wolfe goes back to drinking and ruling the Berlin Wall in hisunderwear, then there¹s a change of guard at the Berlin Wall.The new guard rings up and says to Marcus Wolfe: ³There is pressure at thegates² [body-jump].Marcus Wolfe replies: ³Open the gates² [body-jump].Marcus thinks he means the dog gates. The guard thinks he means the humangates, so the guard opens up the Berlin Wall, and the rest is history . . .. . . thank you very much . . .We also did a whole lot of other stuff you didn¹t see. Some of it you bestdon¹t¹ see. Most of it, when mentioned, has to go through the whole longphase of ridicule before it¹s finally accepted . . . but you¹re all livingin it.Marcus Wolfe was then announced as dying 17 years after the Berlin Wall camedown on the day. ¹17 years¹ doesn¹t mean shit, but ¹18 years¹ does. I tookthat as acknowledgment.At least, on this own, I can claim the cover of Diclofenac, Doxazosin,Tramadol and morphine . . . Morpheus: ""Anyone for another construct?""PS: There was only one Ivy League CIA, in Greece, who managed to call me bymy correct handle.

115,"* Third major Gulf of Mexico project in less than 3 months

HOUSTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has approved $4 billion for its Big Foot project, in its second major Gulf of Mexico development in two months, even as tougher rules and higher costs loom for U.S. deepwater operators.

Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) gave the go-ahead in late September for a second deepwater production hub at its prolific Mars field in the Gulf, indicating the major oil companies will shoulder extra costs to maintain production growth near one of the world’s biggest oil markets.

“Sanctioning Big Foot underscores our commitment to the Gulf of Mexico and will contribute to future U.S. energy supply,” George Kirkland, vice chairman of Chevron, said in a statement on Thursday.

Chevron, Big Foot’s operator, controls 60 percent of the project, while Norway’s Statoil STL.OL has 27.5 percent and Japan’s Marubeni Corp (8002.T) holds the remainder.

Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company behind Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), has continued to invest in the Gulf despite lingering uncertainty over U.S. regulations following BP Plc’s (BP.L) oil spill, with drilling permits still hard to secure.

Chevron said in October it planned to spend $7.5 billion at its Jack/St Malo project in the Gulf. [ID:nN21259958]

Chevron also extended contracts for two shallow-water rigs in the Gulf by six months, at higher rates, rig owner Ensco Plc ESV.N said late on Wednesday. Marubeni, meanwhile, sublet deepwater rig Ensco 8502 for 35 days as the existing client awaits a permit, possibly to drill in one of the four fields Marubeni just bought from BP. [ID:nTOE69O060]

Big Foot, located about 225 miles (360 km) south of New Orleans in water depths of 5,200 feet (1,600 m), is expected to have production capacity of 75,000 barrels of oil and 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day.

First oil is anticipated in 2014, which will be a big year for Chevron. The company is expecting overall annual production growth of only 1 percent through 2014, when its first massive natural gas development off Australia will start up.

The San Ramon, California-based company said last week it planned to increase spending by 20 percent next year, with most of its $26 billion budget earmarked for exploration and production. [ID:nN09222898].

Chevron shares rose 1.2 percent on Thursday to $89.06, their best close since September 2008, compared with a 0.56 percent rise in the Chicago Board Options Exchange index of oil companies. .OIX (Reporting by Anna Driver and Kristen Hays in Houston and Braden Reddall in San Francisco, editing by Gerald E.

638,"The U.S. government released Bigfoot's FBI file yesterday (June 5). It contains a few news clippings, and some formal letters to and from a monster hunter in the 1970s — leading to an examination of 15 hairs and some skin the hunter believed came from ""a Bigfoot.""

It appears that Peter Byrne, that monster hunter, first wrote to the FBI on Aug. 26, 1976. His note, printed on fancy letterhead reading ""The Bigfoot Information Center and Exhibition,"" suggested that the FBI was in possession of flesh and hair belonging to a mysterious creature, possibly belonging to a ""Bigfoot.""

""Gentlemen,"" Byrne wrote, ""Will you kindly, to set the record straight, once and for all, inform us if the FBI, has examined hair which might be that of a Bigfoot; when this took place, if it did take place; what the results of the analysis were."" [Titanosaur Photos: Meet the Largest Dinosaur on Record]

He didn't indicate why he suspected that the FBI might have done such an analysis, only that, ""from time to time we have been informed that hair, supposedly of a Bigfoot… has been examined by the FBI., and with the conclusion, as a report of the examination, that it was not possible to compare the hair with that of any known creature on this continent.""

Byrne appears to have been concerned that the agency wouldn't take The Bigfoot Information Center seriously.

""Please understand that our research here is serious,"" he wrote, ""That this is a serious question that needs answering.""

He also assured the agency that they needn't worry about his implying their involvement in his work.

""An examination of hair, or the opposite, but the FBI., does not in any way, as far as we are concerned, suggest that the FBI., is associated with our project or confirms in any way the possibility of the existence of the creature(s) known as Bigfoot,"" he wrote.

Assistant FBI Director of the agency's laboratory division Jay Cochran Jr. replied two weeks later, on Sept. 10, 1976.

""Since the publication of the 'Washington Environmental Atlas' in 1975, which referred to such examinations, we have received several inquiries similar to yours,"" he wrote. ""However, we have been unable to locate any references to such examinations in our files.""

More than two months later, on Nov. 24, 1976, Byrne replied. Perhaps emboldened by the earlier response, he asked not for information but for a favor. [Real or Not? The Science Behind 12 Unusual Sightings]

""Briefly, we do not often come across hair which we are unable to identify, and the hair that we have now, about 15 hairs attached to a tiny piece of skin, is the first that we have obtained in six years which we feel may be of importance,"" he wrote.

He asked if Cochran ""could possibly arrange for a comparative analysis"" of the tissue to determine its origin.

At the time all this was going on, Bigfoot was in the news. Byrne had been searching for the creature for five years, supported by the Academy of Applied Science (AAS), a small institution in Boston that, according to a document in the file, also sponsored hunts for the Loch Ness monster.

The New York Times had profiled the 50-year-old Byrne's adventures in June of 1976, calling him a ""former professional hunter in Nepal who switched from tiger shooting and yeti hunting to tiger conservation and Bigfoot hunting.""

""Most [Bigfoot sightings] are eventually discounted as insubstantial or faked,"" The New York Times wrote. ""But a handful hold up and are given high credibility. So far Mr. Byrne, though he has never seen a Bigfoot himself, has collected the details of 94 reported sightings that seem believable. There are many more reports of tracks.""

The paper recounted several of those supposedly more credible sightings, and a clipping of that article was included in the FBI file. The next document in the file, in chronological order, was Cochran's instruction to examine the hairs Byrne passed along.

""This does not represent a change in Bureau policy,"" a memorandum included in the file states, in an apparent effort to justify the decision. ""The … Laboratory Branch has a history of making its unique services and expertise available to the Smithsonian Institution, other museums, universities and government agencies in archeological matters and in the interest of research and legitimate scientific inquiry."" [The 25 Most Mysterious Archaeological Finds on Earth]

Unfortunately for Bigfoot hunters, the results weren't what they may have hoped. In 1977, the lab examined the 15 hairs. A final letter from Cochran, addressed to Howard S. Curtis, Executive Vice President of the AAS, read like this:

The hairs which you recently delivered to the FBI Laboratory on behalf of the Bigfoot Information Center and Exhibition have been examined by transmitted and incident light microscopy. The examination included a study of morphological characteristics such as root structure, medullary structure and cuticle thickness in addition to scale casts. Also the hairs were compared directly with hairs of known origin under a comparison microscope.

It was concluded as a result of these examinations that the hairs are of deer family origin.

The hair sample you submitted is being returned as an enclosure to this letter,

Curtis replied March 8, thanking Cochran and saying he'd pass the news on to Byrne when the monster hunter returned from Nepal.

It sounds like the plot of a childhood adventure movie.

Two young boys stumble across a giant, decomposing foot in the woods, leaving local police to wonder whether the grisly find is evidence of the fabled Bigfoot.

But that's exactly what has happened in Massachusetts, U.S., where tests are being carried out on the mysterious remains amid speculation over exactly what kind of creature it belonged to.



According to a report on , the boys found the decomposing foot in woods in Quincy last month.

Baffled officers at the Lakeville Police Department sent the foot to medical examiners to see if they can shed any more light on its origin.



'On March 29, Sgt Steven Leanues picked up what appears to be a decomposed foot that the boys found in the woods off Pantheon Road,' it said, citing the Patriot Ledger newspaper.

'Police Chief Frank Alvihiera sent it to the medical examiner, who determined it is not human, although it appears to have five toes.'

Also known as Sasquatch, Bigfoot is the name given to the hairy, ape-like creature that some believe live in forests in North America.

Sightings of the beast have been reported over decades by people who have pointed variously to mysterious sightings, inexplicably huge footprints, and giant nest-like structures as evidence that the elusive creature does in fact exist.



Believers who claim to have spotted the legendary creature - which was immortalised in the 1987 film Bigfoot and the Hendersons - say it stands between 6ft and 10ft tall, is covered in reddish brown fur, and has a distinctive, unpleasant odour.

Good morning and welcome to Morning Tech. It's a public holiday in some EU countries, including Belgium. But we're here to keep you company if you're stuck at work.

LONDON TECH WEEK: Yes, it’s that time of year again when techies from the British capital (and a whole bunch of politicians) break out the party balloons to celebrate London’s top spot on the European scene. Expect government announcements, claims of record investment and a lot of crowing that Brexit won’t hurt the U.K. digital economy. But if you dig a little deeper, there are two warring factions within 'U.K. Tech' fighting over what the country’s pending departure from the European Union really means — and how the government’s policies are affecting how the local industry will grow. For more from Mark, read below or click here.

Case of the optimists: You don’t have to venture far from hipster Shoreditch or well-heeled Mayfair to hear startup founders and venture capitalists tell you that the volatility created by Brexit ‘is a great opportunity.” And so far, the figures show that the U.K. is doing just fine. The country garnered $8.7 billion in venture funding last year, according to Dealroom, the data provider. And wherever you look, local ‘unicorns’ are being created faster than you can pay £5 for an overpriced flat white coffee near Silicon Roundabout.

Case for the pessimists: Just like everything in divided Britain, not everyone agrees with this assessment, claiming that lagging indicators like venture money don’t really tell you what’s going on around the country today. Instead, they point to a gradual fall in new techies showing up to work in the country’s digital ecosystem (and the ongoing development of rival hubs in Berlin and Paris) as a telling (leading) indicator that not all is well in the state of U.K. tech.

What about the politicians? Glad you asked. Amid this techie stand-off, U.K. lawmakers are playing the ‘cake and eat it, too’ strategy of both trying to woo people to the local tech scene, while also pushing ahead with some of the most aggressive digital regulation anywhere in the Western world. Just like a page out of the Brexit playbook, few policymakers are yet willing to make tough decisions about how to handle the future growth of London and the rest of the country’s tech sector. That’s leaving many locals scratching their heads about how the U.K. will continue to grow without proper leadership from those in Westminster.

Talking of London Tech Week, Theresa May, the outgoing U.K. prime minister announced £153 million in government funding this morning focused on supporting next-generation computing technology. She also said that 2,500 places would be made available on artificial intelligence and data conversion courses starting in 2020, and that a panel of local techies would write a study on the country's tech competitiveness amid the uncertainty caused by Brexit.

""If we are going to maintain our position as a global leader, our challenge is how we develop British Tech and make it even better,"" May is expected to say later this morning. ""We want this to be the place everyone thinks of — and comes to — first when they want to develop their world changing tech ideas.""

COMMISSIONERS' WHEREABOUTS: Justice Commissioner Vĕra Jourová is in Prague, where she speaks at a roundtable on Artificial Intelligence. Digital Commissioner Mariya Gabriel is in Sofia, and meets with various Bulgarian ministers.

MARK YOUR CALENDAR: The Court of Justice of the European Union will rule on the Google vs. Germany’s telecoms regulator case June 13. Judges will have to determine whether Gmail is a telecoms service.

GERMANY ASKS FOR MORE PROTECTION IN E-PRIVACY: Morning Tech did not see that one coming. During Friday’s Telecom Council, the German minister said Berlin “can’t support the [e-Privacy] text at the moment because of the wide-ranging powers to process communications data without the consent of the final user.” Pressing for a higher level of privacy protection, he said Germany “rejects Article 6 at the moment, particularly when it comes to localization data and compatible further processing.” Ministers were discussing the Romanian presidency's progress report.

Watch out for Germany’s position paper: The minister said they are preparing a document to feed future discussions.

Ireland and the U.K. on a different page: Ireland also has reservations about Article 6, but for different reasons: Dublin fears it is over-protective and would hinder the fight against child pornography (a POLITICO investigation in March showed Facebook also pushes that argument in lobby meetings with the Irish government). The U.K. also mentioned child sexual abuse, but also insisted on the importance of clarifying the interaction between e-Privacy and GDPR to avoid legal uncertainty. The British minister asked for “future-proof definitions” and said the scope was not entirely clear. “We would not want this measure to take public broadcasting into the definition of direct marketing,” she said.

The Commission’s (unsurprising) disappointment: Digital Commissioner Mariya Gabriel expressed disappointment as she wanted EU countries to have made an agreement on the text by now. She urged “the incoming Finnish presidency [to] tackle the remaining points.” Finland will take the helm of the EU Council in July, but already hinted it would not reach a general approach on the file.

GDPR AT CJEU: A German court asked a preliminary question to the Court of Justice of the EU on the scope of the right of data access by users under the GDPR. The court wishes to know whether the right of access is “applicable to the committee of a parliament of a constituent state of a Member State that is responsible for processing the petitions of citizens — namely the Petitions Committee of the Hesse Land Parliament.” H/T Frederik Borgesius.

DIGITIZATION AND AI AMONG THE PARLIAMENT LEADERS’ FIVE PRIORITIES: Leaders of the European Parliament last week agreed on five areas they want the EU to prioritize over the next five years, according to the group leaders' agreement seen by POLITICO’s Florian Eder. Environmental and climate issues top the list, followed by economic, competition policy and industrial policy; taxation; innovation, digitalization, artificial intelligence and consumer protection; rule of law and fundamental rights.

Austrian EPP MEPs make committee picks: The delegation of former chancellor Sebastian Kurz, which has seven MEPs, is led by Othmar Karas. Several parliamentarians will ask for committees involved in tech regulation: Karas himself wants to be on the Industry committee, Karoline Edtstadler on the Civil Liberties and Legal Affairs committees, Barbara Thaler on the Internal Market committee and Alexander Bernhuber on the Culture committee.

G20 AGREES, OR DOES IT? Over the weekend, finance ministers from the world's largest economies agreed to overhaul how the likes of Google and Facebook pay taxes worldwide, a potential breakthrough in the bitter debate about where these tech giants should pay tax. As part of the proposals, which are expected to be finalized by the end of next year, countries will now hammer out the details, including potential divvying up the rights to tax firms when their goods or services are sold locally, even if companies don't have a physical presence nationally. If that still doesn't work, governments may then be able to levy a global minimum tax rate.

At first, it's hard not to see this as a victory for France (and the United Kingdom), both countries that have pushed ahead with their own local (digital revenue) taxes because of the lack of a consensus, either across the EU or globally. Speaking at the G20 conference, France's Bruno Le Maire said: ""We have a new economic model based on digital activities and based on the sale and exchange and use of massive data.”

But, but, but: The United States still remains opposed to such digital taxes, claiming that they represent unfair taxation against its tech giants, whereas other countries' global firms (like Germany's automakers) get a free pass under the proposed new regime. With more than a year to go before these rules are supposed to come into force, expect a heavy lobbying fight to either water down the digital tax proposals, or efforts to extend them to other parts of the global economy (where other countries' firms dominate).

Yes, the G20 is moving ahead. But that doesn't mean the fight is over.

TELECOM MINISTERS’ WISHLIST: Telecom ministers highlighted cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and fair competition as priorities for the next five years, in their conclusions adopted at Friday's Telecoms Council. National governments said: ""Europe’s cybersecurity capacity should be reinforced in order to protect its digital infrastructures, products, services and users, and its global competitiveness and digital sovereignty."" It called for regional hubs on cybersecurity to boost ""technological and industrial capacity."" The text also mentioned the ""importance of transparency, fairness, accountability and responsibility in the use of algorithms, so that online platforms across the EU operate in a transparent and predictable manner.""

MACRON TALKS 'SMART REGULATION' WITH TWITTER CEO: The French president Emmanuel Macron met with Jack Dorsey Friday in Paris to discuss the G7 Call to Action and Twitter's efforts on content regulation. ""People want more safety, more privacy, more trust on the web. They want their lives protected and democracy preserved. You are willing to make Twitter a safer place and I share this goal. I count on you [Jack Dorsey] to deliver together on smart regulation, transparency, data ownership,"" Macron tweeted after the meeting. Dorsey said (in French) he would continue working towards a ""safer internet."" The Élysée palace did not reply to a request for comment.

MICROSOFT CUTS DEAL WITH FRENCH TAX AUTHORITIES: The U.S. company agreed last year to pay €350 million in back taxes to cover the 2010-2012 period, according to French media. French authorities made similar deals with Amazon and Apple. “Neither [the ministry of economy] nor Microsoft have officially communicated on the agreement,” ZDNet added.

THE RUSSIA EDITION: Russia’s telecoms regulator said nine major VPNs would soon be blocked because they refused to deny access to sites featuring on the country's national blacklist, TorrentFreak reports. Kaspersky Secure Connection, however, agreed to comply, the regulator’s chief said.

Russian disinformation draws ads on YouTube: Researchers found that 14 YouTube channels linked to Russia and spreading fake news generated billions of views and millions of dollars in ad revenues. Also, videos from those channels were not labeled as state-sponsored, despite pledges from Google’s YouTube to flag such content. Read more on Reuters.

UK can’t make up its mind on tech

Digital Politics is a column about the global intersection of technology and the world of politics.

LONDON — There's a lot Britain can't agree on. Brexit. Who should be the country's next prime minister. Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party.

Add to that list: What to do about tech.

This week, London — still Europe's tech capital despite the ongoing political uncertainty — will play host to its annual ""tech week"" — part marketing ploy, part cheerleading fest to showcase what the British capital, and the rest of the country, has to offer when it comes to glitzy startups, venture capital investment and government support for the digital economy.

Yet in Westminster's halls of power, the hipster mecca of East London and the well-heeled offices of Mayfair, two rival factions are bickering over the health of the U.K.'s tech sector — and how it will fare once the country eventually leaves the European Union.

On one side are the optimists, those who cite the country's record tech investment figures since it voted for Brexit in 2016 as a sign that everything is going great. They dismiss the current political impasse as a mere speed bump on the road to the U.K. putting tech at the center of its future industrial strategy.

On the other side stand the pessimists, who fret about the gradual slowdown of highly educated (European) tech migrants rocking up to fill much-needed jobs in both startups and legacy tech companies. On top of that, the government's aggressive push to regulate the industry — everything from proposed new digital taxes on Big Tech to greater policing of people's social media chatter — has raised eyebrows about its future support for local tech.

The stakes could not be higher.

The U.K. government has largely bet its economic future on the country's burgeoning digital sector. And so far, it can't make up its mind whether to double down on its assistance for local firms and international giants like Google and Facebook — be it through hundreds of millions of pounds of public funding or high-profile digital skills programs — or fall in line with politicians worldwide and the growing ""techlash"" against all things digital.

""They really need to attract investment funds to make sure the tech sector keeps growing,"" said Luca Schiavoni, a digital regulation analysts at Assembly Research, a consultancy firm in London. ""But at the same time, it's really difficult to run into someone in Westminster who believes the tech sector doesn't need more regulation.""

Surely it doesn't have to be a binary choice between pro-industry public policies and arguably one of the toughest regulatory clampdowns anywhere in the Western world?

But just like the other hot-button socio-economic topics now confronting the British public, what to ""do"" about tech needs an answer. And it needs one quickly.

What's muddying the waters is how the local tech scene has faired since the 2016 Brexit referendum. Depending on whom you talk to, the country's digital economy is either full steam ahead or rocketing toward a cliff edge.

Figures published on Monday by TechNation (a quasi-government entity) paint a rosy picture, with U.K. venture capital investment last year hitting $8.7 billion — easily outmatching France and Germany to claim top spot in European tech funding. The number of U.K. startups worth at least $1 billion in 2018 also reached 13, more than all similar fledgling firms in Germany, Israel and Sweden combined.

On top of that, local lawmakers have earmarked hundreds of millions of additional funding through the British Business Bank (another quasi-government institution) to help local techies. Industry veterans — many of whom invested locally, so have skin in the game to play up the positives — also highlight London's continued ability to attract top talent as reasons why Westminster's disjointed approach to the sector should not be cause for concern.

""The U.K. is not the only country having a problem with politics,"" said Martin Mignot, a French partner at Index Ventures, a London-based fund whose investments include Transferwise, a successful local foreign currency exchange startup, and Net-A-Porter, the British e-commerce giant. ""But once you've got the basics like rule of law and functioning democracy, startups aren't going to do badly or well just because of the political situation.""

Not everyone is so sanguine.

While the U.K. government has increased the number of visas for foreign nationals looking to start a tech (or other) business, many in industry aren't convinced that the current conveyor belt of international talent will continue when the country finally leaves the 28-nation bloc.

Britain has already lost its top spot among EU destinations as the place to go for the region's tech workers, according to data from LinkedIn.

In 2017, 14.9 percent of all Europe's tech talent headed to the U.K. in search of work, compared with 13.8 percent of workers traveling to Germany, the second most popular country. But last year, Germany pulled even with Britain, with both garnering 14.6 percent of all EU digital nomads, while France — championed by its president, Emmanuel Macron — has done all that it can to knock the U.K. off its perch as the region's top digital ecosystem.

It's not just talent that may be drying up. A recent survey by KPMG and IHS Markit, two consultancies, shows that economic output from the U.K.'s tech sector had begun to slow, though it's still expanding each quarter at a faster rate than other sectors, and wages to attract and hold onto talent have skyrocketed, hurting businesses' overall bottom lines.

For Giles Derrington, associate director of policy at TechUK, a local trade body whose members include global giants like Google and Apple as well as U.K. players like chip designer ARM Holdings and Sage, the digital accountancy provider, this uncertainty is making it harder for companies to justify future investment in Britain — particularly when the chances of a no-deal Brexit are on the rise.

""The U.K. has always been an obvious center for investment into the EU,"" he said. ""Now, that's a lot harder case to make for businesses. They don't have a clear sense of what the rule of law will look like in the U.K. for the foreseeable future.""",mainstream,M0d397,big.foot
762,"It all started when Denver Riggleman, an Air Force veteran and distillery owner-turned Republican Congressional nominee in Virginia, posted two Bigfoot drawings on his Instagram account. A shrugging Bigfoot, with a black censored bar covering the genitals, and Riggleman’s face digitally superimposed on the shoulders of another naked North American mythological creature.

Over the weekend, his political opponent in Democrat Leslie Cockburn tweeted the images and accused Riggleman of being a “devotee of Bigfoot erotica.” Cockburn, a former investigative journalist, echoed other media outlets when she tweeted that Riggleman was “caught on camera campaigning with a white supremacist,” i.e., Isaac Smith, co-founder of the white-nationalist group Unity & Security, who appeared at a Riggleman’s campaign stop in Virginia. “This is not what we need on Capitol Hill,” she tweeted.

In an interview on Tuesday morning, Riggleman denied both allegations to Rolling Stone. He admits to researching, attending expeditions and writing about Bigfoot. But he’s no Bigfoot fetishist, he says, but has a 14-year-old running joke with military friends, who send him these kind of images for his birthday. The Charlottesville native also denies any link to white supremacists — he claims Smith was “just a kid” who happened to be at one of his campaign functions — bringing up a recent op-ed he wrote for The Roanoke Times in which he slams white nationalism.

Here, Riggleman’s thoughts on Bigfoot, white supremacists and why he chose to prank is wife on their anniversary.

You’re trending on Twitter for being linked to Bigfoot erotica. Tell me about the past few days.

I never thought in a million years that this would happen. There’s not only been a lot of laughter, but a lot of bizarreness, too.

Is your interest in Bigfoot a joke?

It’s a 14-year-old practical joke hobby with a bunch of military buddies.

How did you get interested in Bigfoot?

Back in 1980, my grandfather and I were walking on a spring line [in West Virginia] — which feeds cattle — and he said to stop for a second because he saw something in the woods. He told me to run because he saw something mighty peculiar. I was 10 years old. I didn’t see anything.

And where did your interest in Bigfoot go from there?

In 2004, I told my wife I was going to take her on anniversary trip. When we landed in Seattle, Washington, she thought I was taking her to Hawaii. Instead I said, I thought you’d be excited to go to bigfoot expedition in Olympia Forest. That made her angry. I pranked her. We went on a Bigfoot expedition.

Then in 2005 and 2006, my military buddies found out I [co-writing the book Bigfoot Exterminators, Inc: The Partially Cautionary, Mostly True Tale of Monster Hunt 2006.] That book was a prank. And it’s since become a long-running joke with them.

You’re writing a new book, The Mating Habits of Bigfoot and Why Women Want Him. When do you plan on publishing?

My book is a political allegory. I’d thought I’d self publish it. To me, it’s just hilarious. Now I’m trying to figure out when to publish. I don’t want to take away from the respect of the office. I’ll probably publish it after the election.

So do you believe in Bigfoot?

I don’t believe in Bigfoot. I haven’t seen one and I’ve been on multiple expeditions. But I think it’s the great thing about being an American that anybody can believe what they want.

What’s your reaction to Cockburn’s tweets?

It’s one of the most insane tweets in political history. I don’t know if its desperation or what. I’ve only been in the race eight weeks. Maybe satire or humor or being a normal person isn’t part of a political process.

You say there’s different belief systems in Bigfoot communities. How about politics?

People grab onto these belief systems and don’t want to look outside own boxes. In Bigfoot communities, they’re arguing over mythological creatures. In politics, you see people arguing over myths. Why can’t we compromise? Now you see people becoming so tribal, so wrapped up in histrionics, that they can’t see through the trees.

In Bigfoot belief systems, there’s almost this challenge of trying to see other’s point of views and now i see in [that] politics today. You’re going to see more people like me run because they’re tired of tribal mentality.

In a tweet, Cockburn said that you were on camera campaigning with a white supremacist.

I’ve been [running for] office [for] eight weeks. They tried to hook the white supremacy stuff to my predecessor [Republican incumbent Tom Garrett, who met with white nationalist leader Jason Kessler in 2017]. They don’t know what to do with me. I’m not a white supremacist.

I think she [Cockburn] panicked. I thought it was pretty crass. White supremacy is an important subject and to equate that to Bigfoot seems to me to be irresponsible.

Did you ever campaign with a white supremacist?

I’ve never campaigned with a white supremacist. The person they’re talking about it was a kid standing by the wall. I think he was captured by a film crew at a public event. He doesn’t work for our campaign. We don’t know if he’s a white nationalist or not. He’s just a kid.",mainstream,M1275a,big.foot
243,"Thousands of Americans are waiting to return to normalcy, but for many that may not mean going back to an office. Working from home could be the new normal for many employees as more major employers and CEOs, including Mondelez, Nationwide and Barclays, talk about a permanent shift to work from home and reduced office space. Companies have been forced to embrace remote working amid stay-at-home orders for all nonessential positions and businesses. In the process, corporations are seeing proof that productivity does not suffer, and employees may not need to return to offices in order to be productive and accomplish their work tasks. It also may be part of required cost-cutting as companies plan for what could be a prolonged global economic slump. Nationwide announced on Wednesday a permanent transition to a hybrid work model. The insurance company will operate in their four main corporate offices in central Ohio; Des Moines, Iowa; Scottsdale, Arizona; and San Antonio, while the majority of their locations will continue working from home.

""We've been investing in our technological capabilities for years, and those investments really paid off when we needed to transition quickly to a 98% work-from-home model,"" Nationwide CEO Kirt Walker said in a statement. ""Our associates and our technology team have proven to us that we can serve our members and partners with extraordinary care with a large portion of our team working from home."" Nationwide plans on exiting all other locations by Nov. 1, 2020. During its earnings call on Tuesday, CEO Dirk Van De Put of food giant Mondelez said the company is making some adjustments that will make it easier for the company in a recession, including a rethink of where people work. ""Maybe we don't need all the offices that we currently have around the world. So there is a major effort going, taking place as it relates to the costs in the business,"" the Mondelez CEO said. Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman is uncertain about what work life will look like after the pandemic but said the bank would need ""much less real estate"" in the future. About 90% of Morgan Stanley's employees have been working from home during the pandemic.

""We've proven we can operate with no footprint,"" he said in a recent Bloomberg TV interview. ""Can I see a future where part of every week, certainly part of every month, a lot of our employees will be at home? Absolutely."" Barclays CEO Jes Staley said this week that putting thousands of workers in a corporate office building may never happen again. ""There will be a long-term adjustment in how we think about our location strategy ... the notion of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past,"" he said in public comments this week after the company's earnings. The outlook implies harder times for the commercial real estate industry, as the corporate reductions will come at the same time that retail and restaurant businesses may have to unwillingly vacate their commercial leases. Commercial property has spent years soaring but fell 1.3% in March, according to Green Street's Commercial Property Price Index, and many investors expect commercial real estate to remain under pressure. WeWork recently stopped paying some rents.

During the first two weeks of the coronavirus outbreak, over 2,600 borrowers with commercial mortgage-backed securities loans needed potential debt relief, according to Fitch Ratings. It tracked 47% of the relief request to hotel assets and 30% to retail properties. J.C. Penney missed a $12 million corporate bond interest payment and is now considering bankruptcy as the pandemic continues to hinder its plans for a turnaround. Gap stopped paying rents in April. Hedge fund icon Carl Icahn said in March that shorting commercial real estate was among his biggest bets. In the least, workers can expect the reinforcement of social distancing, more employees working on a semiregular basis and new designs at their offices. Property managers and designers are already anticipating the layout and designs of future office spaces. The building layout will discourage the spread of germs and new seating arrangements, while new technology could give employees access to conference rooms and elevators without having to touch doorknobs or press buttons. Previously open floor plans were highly encouraged, since it promoted unity and collaboration throughout the office. These new office adjustments will instead mirror trends from a decade ago, when cubicles and more personal offices were the norm.",mainstream,M0d955,big.foot
101,"Previously, Russia was able to push for an early checkmate against US warmongers when it successfully convinced the Assad government to destroy its chemical weapons arsenal under UN supervision, removing any pretext for Western aggression against the country.

 

 Since then, the Cabalists were being limited in their WW3 thrust and were forced to recycle the usual false flag operations which everybody has learned to dismiss as nothing but signs of subsyndromal symptomatic depression, or SSD, as most of these pseudo-Grand Chessboard players are already in their advanced age.

But the ISIS/L virus has already spread and even the purveyors themselves are under threat due to massive influx of asylum seekers where ISIS/L terrorists could embed themselves with when entering Europe and US.

Nevertheless, the Cabalists must pressed on with their occasional “unintentional” airdropping of military support to the “Free Syrian Rebels” because dictator Assad must go. Wait, Assad must stay, he’s the lesser evil now compared to the rogue ISIS. Oh my, we can’t make up our own minds anymore…

While these confusions are going on inside the Cabal camp, the supply of smuggled oil in the black markets continue to flow. The ISIS/L industry is a multi-billion cash cow for the Cabalists.

With only 30% of Syrian land remaining under government control, Russia has no choice but to deploy boots on the ground which are now being joined in by Iranian foot soldiers, too.

“Qasem Soleimani, commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force, has sent hundreds of ground soldiers into Syria in the past few days apparently in cooperation with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, said a senior Israeli security official Thursday.

Russia has also recently deployed military assets into Syria and according to the Israeli source, has teamed up with Iran in an unprecedented attempt to protect the embattled regime of Bashar Assad from falling to rebel groups including the Islamic State.

The Israeli source said that Iran’s increased military involvement in Syria was “due to Assad’s crisis and under Russian-Iranian cooperation as a result of a meeting between Soleimani with Russian President Vladimir Putin,” said the Israeli source.”

These series of events shocked Washington as the other side of the Atlantic compounded its Middle Eastern imminent defeat by electing a leftist, anti-NATO UK Labour Party leadership of Jeremy Corbyn.

Add to that is the refusal of Greece to Obama’s request to deny Russian humanitarian planes bound for Syria of its airspace.

 Near the equator, we also have Japan unable to sustain its economy supporting multiple anti-Russian economic sanctions and is now planning to trade directly in Yen-Ruble denominations.

Let it be understood that the plan to dismantle the Syrian government has been made decades earlier, and actual logistical and training support were already extended to the Syrian opposition earlier than the Arab Spring “color revolutions”.

The Iranians, having themselves survived several attempts to topple their own revolutionary government, are now taking the geopolitical and military offensives in what could end up as the final offensive against the Cabalists in the Middle East, in a grand prelude to the elaborate launching of Manipulated Reality 2.0 by the Vatican.

 The Palestinian flag will also be flying during this event, with the United States being pressured by the Vatican to reopen its Cuban embassy and normalize diplomatic relations with the country much earlier.

There’s also a move to relocate the United Nations headquarters in a neutral country. Switzerland is said to be as neutral as the Vatican.

 Finally, China is now more than ready to bring in the Meltdown of the Worst Kind to shut the whole fiat economy down by bursting its own massive bubble.

Of course, it can afford to do so with its massive gold hoardings, and so is Russia.

 Iran, for its part, is already anxious in welcoming new investments and reestablish trading with the rest of the world once Western economic sanctions are fully lifted as a direct result to the successful conclusion of the Iran Nuclear Deal with the White House, not without the holy prodding from the Vatican, of course.

 The Eurasian push for a saner world is being underscored with a massive anti-NATO coordinated security forces in the region.

The rest of the population have also been promised as worthy beneficiaries of the first tranche of humanitarian packages amounting to US$ 1.7 trillion through the Keenan Group.

Again, this is just the first tranche of humanitarian support and we believe there will be more tangible assistance which might be channeled through the newly establish Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the BRICS Bank, etc.,once the Cabalists are fully neutralized

 However the corporate United States proceeds from hereon, Russia and China have already given enough warnings.

198,"As he became the first person to set foot on the moon, Neil Armstrong announced, “That’s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.” This exhibition celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of that remarkable achievement as the last step in a long series that stretches back through the centuries to the beginnings of the modern scientific understanding of our place in the universe.

On display are landmarks in the history of science from Houghton Library’s collections—such as first editions of Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton—together with rarely exhibited highlights from a private spaceflight collection, including artifacts used during the Apollo 11 mission and on the moon itself by astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Together, these objects illuminate the path of research and discovery that made Apollo 11 possible.

The exhibition is free and open to the public. Closes August 3.

The exhibition is accompanied by a commemorative catalog which focuses on the loaned items only and is also available for free online here.

Join curator John Overholt for a guided tour of the exhibition to learn about the ways early modern science inspired and made possible the historic Apollo 11 moon landing.

433,"(CBS News) Cryptozoology is a word many (if not most) of us have never seen before. Sort of like the legendary creatures cryptozoologists devote their lives to tracking down. Our Serena Altschul has joined the hunt:

In Jefferson, Texas recently, a group of like-minded (or should we say, like-obsessed) people gathered to swap stories of strange sightings ... mysterious animals and elusive creatures lurking in the deep woods.

There's a scientific name for it: Cryptozoology. Loren Coleman explains: ""'Crypto' means 'hidden.' 'Zo' means animals. 'Ology' means the study of. It's the study of hidden or unknown animals.""

Which sounds very academic, until you realize that those ""hidden animals"" include the Yeti (better known as the Abominable Snowman), the Loch Ness Monster, and the favorite obsession of THIS Cryptozoology Conference, Bigfoot (a.k.a. Sasquatch).

For scientist David Nixon, his fascination with cryptozoology is a guilty pleasure. ""It's fun. Whether or not it's science, hard to say."" He admitted, though, ""This is not exactly the kind of thing I talk about at work.""

This part of East Texas, it turns out, is a hotspot of Bigfoot activity. ""The Legend of Boggy Creek,"" which claimed to be based on real Bigfoot sightings, was filmed just an hour north of here. It terrified teenagers across the country in 1972.

""It was like the first movie I'd seen in a theater where I felt like, if I walked out of the theater at night, I could encounter the screen monster I'd seen,"" said David Coleman.

That first encounter with Bigfoot inspired a lifetime of tracking him down on the big AND little screen.

""He's America's monster, you know?"" Coleman said. ""He's a shared cultural icon"" - even if he's not real.

These days, ""America's monster"" has inspired an avalanche of cable TV reality shows and testimonials on the Internet. A whole army of Bigfoot hunters, like Bill Brock, has taken to the woods hoping to catch a glimpse of the beast - or at least one of his giant footprints.

Future cryptozoologist Aiden Myers was enthralled by the footprints casts: ""I never saw anything like this!""

Director Eduardo Sanchez' first movie, ""The Blair Witch Project,"" became an instant horror classic. Now he's making a movie about Bigfoot. ""I want to see a Bigfoot so badly, I made a movie about it.""

For Sanchez and producer Mark Ordusky, Bigfoot has been a lifelong obsession.

""There's just something about it being just out of reach, not being able to see it,"" said Sanchez. ""It's like this quest.""

A quest, Ordusky added, ""that goes ever onward.""

Sanchez believes Bigfoot deserves more respect: ""Bigfoot's been kind of a joke lately. You know, he's in commercials, and even though I love that humor, I'm always thinking, 'Man, I wish somebody would make a film that made Bigfoot scary again.'""

For Loren Coleman, cryptozoology is serious science. ""A lot of people would like to put it in some kind of category of pseudoscience, and we really reject that,"" he said.

He founded the world's only Cryptozoology Museum, in Portland, Me. Its logo is a strange-looking fish called a Coelocanthe, thought to be extinct for 65 million years, until one was found in 1938.

""It's a living fossil,"" said Coleman. ""And actually the words 'living fossil' was first associated with this fish.""

""So, do you believe in Bigfoot?"" Altschul asked.

1311,"WWE have announced two huge arrivals at their Performance Center in Orlando - a pair of seven-foot giants trained by none other than the Great Khali.

Former world champion Khali, real name Dalip Singh Rana, shot to stardom in the world's largest wrestling company following his arrival in 2006.

He was the fourth tallest man to ever compete on the WWE main roster and is now helping to bring through the next generation of talents.

And he may now have helped unearth another duo of monsters who could make it as big - LITERALLY.

 WWE confirmed the news this afternoon while announcing a trio of new recruits from India.

A report on their website read: ""At 7 feet tall, 310-pound Gurvinder Singh of Jagadhri is an experienced cricketer and actor that trained for the squared circle under another giant of the ring, The Great Khali.

""Sukhwinder Grewal is another titanic trainee of Khali, standing 7-foot-2 and tipping the scales at 340 lbs. The 24-year-old played basketball before setting his sights on the ring.""

And on the third new arrival, WWE added: ""Twenty-five-year-old Laxmi Kant Rajpoot comes to Orlando from Banda and has athletic experience in javelin throwing and taekwondo.""

Sun Sport reported last July that a new giant was already around the Performance Centre after the humongous Jordan Omogbehin debuted at an NXT live show.

And the 7ft 3in colossus made quite the impression as he dominated TWO OPPONENTS on his winning bow.

Omogbehin was born in Lagos, Nigeria but played high school basketball in the States after moving to Virginia.

After quitting the court, the towering behemoth was snapped up by NXT founder and wrestling legend Triple H for WWE.

Despite his towering frame, Omogbehin is still only THIRD on the all-time list of tallest WWE superstars.

Giant Gonzalez, real name Jorge Gonzalez and who had spells in both WCW and WWE, tops the list.

The icon, who died in 2010 aged 44, stood a ginormous EIGHT FEET TALL!

That even dwarfed the legendary late, great Andre ‘The Giant’ – who was only a mere 7ft 4in in comparison.

And the Big Show is a baby compared to those big boys.

The 47-year-old former world champion, real name Paul Wight, stands at just seven feet.",mainstream,M0befc,big.foot
798,"Most of the pictures of Bigfoot, a giant ape-like creature supposed to live in the dense forests of the American north-west, are in reality a hoaxer's wife dressed in a gorilla suit, the man's relatives revealed yesterday.

For decades until his death last month Ray Wallace tantalised America with pictures of footprints, recordings and photographs of the creature, but his family admitted it had all been an elaborate practical joke.

To the horror of thousands of Bigfoot believers Dale Lee Wallace, the hoaxer's nephew, said: ""He did it for the joke and then he was afraid to tell anyone because they'd be so mad at him.""

The first ""evidence"" for Bigfoot, a series of huge footprints, was found by Jerry Crew, a worker at Mr Wallace's construction company in August 1958.

They were in fact created by his boss with wooden carved feet to ""freak him out"", but the local newspaper, the Humboldt Times in Eureka, California, ran a front-page story on the prints the next day and coined the term ""Bigfoot"".

The tale was taken up by newspapers across the country and the public, fascinated at the time by tales of the Himalayan yeti, eagerly embraced the notion of a homegrown version.

Mr Wallace continued with the prank for years, producing photographs of Bigfoot eating elk and frogs. These, it emerged yesterday, were, in fact, members of his family - usually his wife Elna - dressed in a hairy ape suit with giant feet stuck to the bottom.

The most famous evidence for Bigfoot's existence, the so-called Patterson film, a grainy, cinefilm image of an erect ape-like creature, was taken by Roger Patterson, a rodeo rider, in 1967. It was another of Mr Wallace's fakes, the family said - he told Mr Patterson where to go to spot the creature and knew who had been inside the suit.

The family decided finally to reveal the truth after Mr Wallace, 84, died from heart failure. A reporter for the Seattle Times approached them to ask about the rumours and if he had made it all up.

The news is a serious setback for the Bigfoot industry spawned by the legend. Dozens of books have been written, guides offer tours to search for sightings, and there is even an International Bigfoot Society in Hillsboro, Oregon.

Jeff Meldrum, an associate professor of anatomy and anthropology at Idaho State University and one of America's most prominent Bigfoot hunters, said: ""There are historical accounts of Bigfoot-like creatures going back to the 1880s. How do you explain that?""",mainstream,M11a4c,big.foot
820,"Many dream of summiting the world’s tallest peak, Mount Everest, which soars to 29,035 feet and straddles the Nepal-China border. Sir Edmund Hillary and Tensing Norgay first accomplished the feat in 1953 via Nepal’s South Col, which remains one of the most common routes today. The Nepali government relies on the tourism revenue generated by Everest, and in 2019 it issued a record 381 permits to climbers and a nearly equal number to local Sherpas, who set up the camps and lead the climbers up the mountain. (Here's why the world's most daunting mountains inspire us.)

Besides the glory of standing on the roof of the world, climbing Everest comes with a significant amount of controversy. Over the years, the large number of climbers and support staff have left massive amounts of trash and waste on the mountain, though in recent years the Nepali government and private organisations have taken steps to clean up the area around base camp. This year critics cited the large number of permits as a possible contributor to some of the season's 11 deaths on the mountain. The large number of people seeking to make the summit combined with fewer windows of favourable weather created traffic jams on the route to the summit.

Until conditions improve at Mount Everest, beat the crowds and help preserve the environment by looking to other epic climbs around the world. Here are nine of our favorites.

In Mongolia, it’s easy for a traveller to be quickly swept away by the endless green steppes, the heartiness of the Kazakh nomads, and the rolling landscapes that define the Altai Mountains. This makes the trek to Mount Khuiten as enjoyable and scenic as the climb itself.The mountain straddles the corners of Russia, China, and Mongolia. To reach it, trekkers must cross a golden, vast, and barren landscape that is one of the last remote regions on Earth. This remarkable journey is enhanced by the gentle hospitality of the Kazakh nomads.

Flat-topped Kilimanjaro is Africa’s highest mountain. Located on Tanzania’s northern border with Kenya, the mountain is made up of three extinct volcanoes, Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. The highest peak, Uhuru, is 19,340 feet high. Reaching the top of Kilimanjaro is exhilarating. Take the Machame Route up so you can see the region’s wonderful animals and birds. Then you’ll begin the trek across the Shira Plateau through the Grand Barranco Canyon and on to the top. If all goes as planned, you’ll reach Stella Point with a chance to continue around Kibo’s rim to Uhuru.

The Inca Trail in Peru is an in-depth journey through a variety of ecosystems, from plains to desert to tropical cloud forests. You’ll pass views of snowcapped mountains and rushing rivers. The highlight is Machu Picchu, the famed lost city of the Inca that was discovered in 1911 by Hiram Bingham. Then continue your trek to what was the heart and soul of the Inca Empire, Cusco. (Discover 10 secrets of Machu Picchu.)

Nestled in the Swiss Alps, the Matterhorn is the most recognised mountain on the European continent, and probably the world. In the shape of a roughly chiseled rock pyramid, this peak serves as a defining geographical landmark. For many climbers, ascending the Matterhorn, the birthplace of the sport of mountaineering, represents a return to the purist traditions of climbing.

Dynamic in both region and terrain, Russia's Mount Elbrus stands as a watchtower in the Caucasus Mountains between Europe and Asia. Elbrus is a large, double-coned volcano, whose summits vary by about 65 feet. For the climber with moderate skills, the highest mountain in Europe has great appeal because it presents a strenuous, yet rewarding climb. The mountain’s location affords visitors excellent opportunities to see the region’s large melting pot of ethnic groups, such as Turkish, Georgian, Azeri, and Russian.

In the heart of Mexico, about 800 miles south of the United States border, Citlaltépetl and Iztaccíhuatl are the third and seventh highest mountains respectively in North America. The first is 18,406 feet tall, while the second is 17,159 feet tall. Ascents of these two volcanoes are by far the most attractive climbs in Mexico. From a distance, it’s easy to see how Iztaccíhuatl or “white woman” got its name; the snowcapped peaks look like the head, breasts, and feet of a sleeping woman.",mainstream,M0fb20,big.foot; new.world.order
514,"As an independent Scientist and Medical researcher since 1994, I have been working ( ), on a completely new theory for circulation within humans, animals and plants. My discovery was initially in trees. In 1995, I demonstrated the new paradigm to Forestry Commission Scientists and journalists, causing water to flow up a single length of open ended tubing at a cliff in Brixham, Devon, to a height of 78 feet and demolished a three hundred year old law of physics (Torricelli). The discovery is founded upon gravity and evaporation. Salts and sugars are concentrated as a result of evaporation, making the fluids heavier, gravity draws the heavy fluids down and the less dense fluids are drawn up in a return flow (for every action there must be a reaction). Anything that interferes with evaporation (damp/humidity), compromises circulation, when circulation within the human body is compromised, it causes lethargy and affects feet and hands first! Since 1994, my efforts have been concentrated on helping people with debilitating illnesses by tilting the bed in an inclined position, (head raised 5-8 degrees to the horizontal. Gravity has been shown to be significant in reversing neurological and non-neuro conditions, non-more compelling than the recent Carlton TV News coverage of a man walking, after ten years of paralysis due to a spinal cord injury. (Reporter: Tim Iredale, Carlton TV News, Devon.) This discovery is simple, true and repeatable and has the most profound implications for the benefit of mankind! Yet, scientists, ministers, charities and most of the medical profession chose to ignore, what is after all basic, pure science. How long can a scientific truth be ignored?

Once gravity is accepted as the primary cause of circulation, it becomes clear to understand why foot and mouth disease affects the flesh around the hooves of grazing animals. It is not a coincidence that hooves, tusks and even finger and toenails occur where they do. They are merely disposal sites for heavy substances, which arrive, where they do because of gravity! It is no coincidence that we, the most vertical of all species, are the most successful! Gravity is evolution! The specific gravity of urine for instance was used to determine whether gravity driven circulation could be taking place in humans and animals, In a similar process. For example respiration causes water to evaporate from the lungs and respiratory tract. Fluids remaining in the body contain minerals and must therefore be concentrated by the loss of mineral free water (evaporation). Gravity causes the heavy solution to be drawn back through the lining of the lungs and respiratory tract and down through the vessels in the body, carrying dissolved oxygen with it. Concentrated solutions arrive at the bladder via the kidneys where they are excreted in the urine. However the kidneys are not 100% efficient and some minerals arrive in the lowest anatomical extremities, solidifying as finger and toenails or horses hooves etc. Clippings of which sink when dropped into water. 5 degree to the horizontal head down tilt over one week decreased the specific gravity of urine to a near zero reading. 5 degree to the horizontal head up tilt over one week significantly increased the specific gravity of urine when compared to horizontal bedrest. Gravity does indeed play an important roll in renal function! Toxins leave the body more efficiently when the human body is correctly aligned with the direction of gravity. The physiology of pig is very close to humans. So close in fact that pig is now used to cultivate replacement organs for humans. One could deduce that many of todays illnesses affecting us could also be affecting pig and visa-versa. In fact almost all of the drugs used in veterinary practice today have a human equivalent which in many cases is identical to those prescribed to animals in all but the name of the drug. (See Page 5 Health news) It is also worth remembering that many of these drugs have been tested on animals before entering the £ multi-billion consumer marketplaces, which currently satisfies the medical and scientific industries. Towards the end of the year 2000, while driving past a pig farm on three occasions, I noticed that the animals were walking around ankle deep in water, mud, urine and excrement. Due undoubtedly to the excessive rainfall Britain was experiencing at the time and I remember thinking to myself that these unfortunate animals were exposed to environmental factors that could not be healthy to say the least. If scientists were correct about the physiological similarities between pigs and humans, then these pigs were in real trouble due to the appalling weather conditions they were exposed to. Take a thousand people, strip them naked and leave them to face the same elements and water logged fields we have seen here in Britain for six months and see how many of us survive. Of course this would be considered inhumane and could never happen to humans, but it is happening!- all the time to pigs and other farm animals? Remember that long soak in the bath or spending too long at the swimming baths. Toes feet and fingers that looked like they belonged to someone much older, all wrinkled and horrible. Soldiers on manoeuvres in tropical regions face foot rot due to the wet and humid conditions. Jungle fever, leprosy, typhoid and many other diseases abound in such environments. Or do they? Could it be that the adverse environment reduces our resistance to many of these illnesses? Wet weather certainly affects our health and is bore out by the sudden increase in deaths among the elderly every Autumn and Winter. Sudden Infant and adult deaths occur more frequently and influenza outbreaks, which have wiped out many thousands of people, are well documented. Aching arthritic joints, bronchitis, pleurisy, pneumonia, seasonal affective disorder, to mention a few, add more problems to our already over-stretched National health services. Yet we do at least live in relatively comfortable homes when compared to the pig, sheep or cow! Every time there is a serious flood in the developing world, where people have less adequate accommodation, cholera outbreaks become a real problem! Rotting bodies and the carcasses of animals poison the water. However there are a number of more unfortunate people who live on the streets all over the world, including Britain. It is within this underclass of the worlds poor people that serious illnesses abound, like tuberculosis. Surely this must cement in place the fact that we, like the farm animals, cant survive the harsh elements that the weather places upon us unless we find a clean, warm and dry shelter! In the late Tudor Period, British history tells the story of the Sweating Sickness, which killed off many tens of thousands of people. Reference was made and documented as to the unusually high humidity affecting Britain and Europe alike. Eventually, A tempest (storm) swept away the illness and with it went the humidity. Fortunately, living conditions for most have improved since the Tudor period. The weather in the UK in the years 2000-2001 has been the wettest on record, many homes have been flooded time and time again. Yet little if any time has been devoted to connecting the foot and mouth outbreak this year to the environmental factors even though there is documented evidence which supports the fact that humidity prolongs the life of pathogenic infectious agents. (Page6: How is the virus destroyed?)

Leslie Monroe conducted a statistical analysis of incidence of sudden infant deaths (SIDS) His work now forms part of the statistics collection shown on Open University Programmes. Leslie Monroe showed beyond any shadow of a doubt, that living in low lying river valley areas, which suffered Winter Waterlogged soils had a much greater incidence of SIDS, up to 46% above the National average. I have spoken with Mr Monroe on several occasions and challenge anyone to find fault with his findings. Universities have--and failed to find anything to the contrary! I conducted my own comparisons based on monthly rainfall plotted in a graph against monthly occurrences of SIDS from 1985 to 1992. The graph shows a double mirror image. Not only do the peaks and troughs match convincingly, but also the general downward drift of rainfall from 1985 to 1992, leading to a drought in the winter of 1992 was followed by an almost identical decline in SIDS. Could it be the humidity/damp in these areas that increases the incidence of SIDS? Yet in 1997 in the months before and during the last outbreak of foot and mouth disease, the rainfall in Britain was again excessively wet and prolonged. Veterinary surgeon Hugh Peplow of Munnings Mitchell & Peplow remembers the appalling weather conditions of 1967 Notable Features of the Weather (Monthly weather report . MET Office) volume: 84 No: 13 Date 21st August 1973. Summary for the year 1967 1967 was a rather wet year. May was an exceptionally wet month. Rainfall being over three times the national average over large areas of Northern England. Over the country as a whole it was the wettest May since 1773. The 14th & 15th were the wettest days and noteworthy falls in many parts of the country included one of 22mm in 15 minutes at Wollerton Park, Norfolk on the 14th. Heavy storms led to widespread flooding in Lancashire between the 8th and 10th of August; at Hornby 75 mm of rain was recorded in 15 minutes July: The first 10 days were cool with weather mainly dry in the south-east, but with occasional rain in the north and west. The 13th marked the beginning of 10 days of thundery weather, thunderstorms were widespread on the 14th &15th From the 24th a number of rain-belts spread south-eastwards over the country. The 27th & 29th were wet in all districts. August: Cool and unsettled weather during first week. south-east mainly dry. Thundery outbreaks from the 8th until the 11th ended violently and with wide spread flooding, especially in Lancashire, where 75 mm of rain fell in 3 hours. North-westerly winds brought cooler weather to most districts on the 12th, but from the 14th to the 18th there was a good deal of rain. The 19th to 28th was a generally warm dry period, although in some places remained cool because overnight fog was slow to clear. The last three days were unsettled although south-east was mainly dry. The first 5 days were generally unsettled, with frequent often severe gales. Prolonged rain, heavy at times, was broken by showery weather during the afternoon of the 2nd and during the 4th Tiree recorded 75mm of rain during this period. 10th & 11th were generally dull and wet days, other days being fine. 15th & 16th dull but mainly dry. 17th an area of rain moved across most districts and another during the night of 18th/19th , scattered thunderstorms on the 20th and heavy showers on the 21st were followed by a week of warmer weather and southerly winds, however rain was widespread on the 24th, 25th and 29th. 30th sunny with scattered showers. October (Time of the 1967 outbreak of FMD) (Source of local information for Oct: Vol 84 same report) First 3 days were cool and stormy with widespread rain and gales, 4th bright and showery, but further rain reached south-west England from the Atlantic on the 5th. Mild south-westerly winds occurred on the 6th spreading throughout the country. A wet period followed, heavy rain on the 8th 9th & 10th led to widespread floods in the Lake District, south-west Scotland and north Wales. North Wales suffered considerable flood damage on the 10th. Great Langdale (Westmoorland) recorded 146mm in 24 hours. 11th Cooler westerly winds brought further rain and temperatures fell too near normal. 12th & 13th were sunny and dry for most of the country. A wet day on the 14th and Northerly winds brought a sharp drop in temperatures on the 15th. The 16th was the stormiest day of the month and heavy rains led to renewed widespread flooding in Wales and the Midlands. The days rainfall exceeded 50 mm in many parts of the Midlands, 85mm fell at Lwynon (Brecknock). The second half of the month was changeable and rather wet. Gales were severe in places and continued on the 17th from a north-westerly direction behind the depression. Thundery showers spread to all districts in this cold north-westerly air-stream and snow was reported as far south as Ringway (Manchester). Prolonged sunny periods on the 18th & 22nd Temperatures were above average for the week following the 18th but the last five days of the month were rather cool with widespread rain on the 19th 20th 27th and rain reached all districts late in the day on the 30th 31st widespread rain. The unsettled, stormy and cold weather continued for most of the first week. Rain was widespread and heavy locally on most days of this week. Rain reached northern districts on the 24th and spread southwards over the country bringing to an end 11 dry days at many places over Southern England. 27th- unsettled with rain alternating with brighter showery periods. Overnight fog was slow to disperse in the Midlands during the first two days. Rain spread South Eastwards across the country on the night of the 2nd. 3rd mainly fine. North westerly winds reached gale force during the next two days, and rain moving south. Followed by 5 days of cold Northerly winds which brought snow to all districts. Rain continued on the 11th moving to the south-east of England for most of the 12th. Widespread rain on the 15th followed by 4 days of cold weather with snow showers and night frosts. 21st to 27th saw milder wet weather, but the 28th saw cold northerly winds with some snow until the end of the month. I have contacted the Ministry Of Agriculture Fisheries and Food (MAFF) and the National Farmers Union (NFU) and all I got in return was ""not now, this is the wrong time to consider your work in this field, come back when all of this has blown over. However, my wife heard on the TV days after I had spoken to a veterinary surgeon at MAFF that the outbreak of foot and mouth will subside when the weather changes for the better! Why the mass slaughter of livestock and disruptions to the farming and tourist industries if the problem will resolve itself when the rain stops? (page8 Persistence of Virus

Is slaughter really necessary?

PROPOSEL put to MAFF and the NFU

Confine a number of affected animals in a secure, clean containment room with dry bedding food and water and room for exercise, use a dehumidifier to remove the moisture from the air to create a warm dry environment. Study the effects of the improved environmental conditions on the affected animals for five weeks and see if they recover! Having put my proposal to MAFF, which in my opinion would be simple and cost effective to conduct. No further action looks imminent, instead the mass slaughter continues, as if there is some other hidden agenda behind it, perhaps to make sure that the future stocks on our farms are free from BSE? Or simply to make use of the surplus meat and dairy produce, which was given away to people in Britain a few years ago? (EEC. meat and butter mountains) caused by intensive farming and the resulting overproduction! One official at least said that he thought my arguments had some validity, fitting with many of the known parameters in foot and mouth disease. He said that it is thought that the summer months will eliminate the disease and this is thought to be because of the rays from the sun and that it should be investigated further (Page8: Persistence of virus ). I pointed out that my proposal did not involve the sun and that if successful would prove this point.

By mid-December 1998, the disease had spread to Sikamat, about 60 km south of Kuala Lumpur, through movement of infected pigs. Seven of the 20 workers developed the disease and five died in January 1999.

By March 1999 the disease had spread to the major pig producing area of Bukit Pelandok in the State of Negeri Sembilan

The disease spread to more farms and, from 1 March to 10 May 1999, a total of 224 suspected cases of viral encephalitis occurred in Negeri Sembilan with 80 fatalities. Out of a total of 258 persons suspected of being infected with the Nipah virus, 100 have died.

In a previously infected farm, more than 95% of sows had Nipah virus antibodies. More than 90% of the piglets had antibodies assumed to be maternal antibodies. Antibody prevalence across all ages is currently being

 studied in an infected farm. END OF COPIED REPORT

[This is the first comprehensive report we have seen and may be the first comprehensive report. Japanese encephalitis is no longer being reported as the etiologic agent of Nipah disease and other steps forward obviously have

The outlook for FMD in Great Britain 2001 is for a very large epidemic. It will grow fast in the next few weeks and continue for many months. The number of cases will rise steeply with rapid expansion in the existing areas in spite of current controls. Estimates vary from 70 cases a day over the next two weeks to over 4000 cases by June 2001. The Ministry of Agriculture and the Food Standards Agency held a joint meeting on 21 March to receive urgent advice from independent expert epidemiologists. Jim Scudamore (Chief Veterinary Officer), Sir John Krebs (Chairman FSA) and Professor David King (Chief Scientific Adviser) heard reports from Neil Ferguson and colleagues (Imperial College) Mark Woolhouse (University of Edinburgh) and opinions from experts at the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency. The models and analysis use data recorded by MAFF up to 19 March 2001. A brief summary of the available findings is attached; Imperial plan to publish shortly. The effect of controls on animal movement from 23 February was noted, but all the experts advised the need for further drastic action to bring disease under control. Otherwise FMD will become established in Britain. Speedier slaughter of infected animals will help to reduce transmission. But this needs to be accompanied by immediate slaughter of all susceptible species around infected farms otherwise the final number of cases will be very high. Depending on the extent of these interventions, the combined strategy could reduce the epidemic substantially. The experts said the last major epidemic in UK 1967/8 was quite different. In 2001 more of the country is affected, sheep are an important reservoir of infection, the scale of dissemination by animal movement was enormous early on. In addition the size of flocks and herds means the scale of operations is very big. t is stressed that these are preliminary results, which do not represent a final view from the modelling teams, or from the Government. The external teams have not yet had the opportunity to model the impact of FMD's geographic distribution, or of the characteristics of different species.

746,"There's no doubt that America is enthralled with Wall Street's big hitters. Many of them lead lives that seem more befitting of rock stars than those of MBAs. Making millions is just one benefit of a career that includes rubbing elbows with the rich and famous. Making it big on Wall Street is something that many ambitious professionals set their sights on, especially when they're fresh out of college.

But don't expect to find the Wall Street job of your dreams in Sunday's classified section of your local paper. The most glamorous positions usually go unadvertised and require more hustle than resume, and more moxie than diploma. These positions aren't always handed out to the boss's nephew, either, but instead, to those willing to fight tooth-and-nail for a shot. If you're up for the challenge, here are four of Wall Street's most glamorous jobs and what it takes to land them.

Although it's lost a little of its luster since the burst of the dotcom bubble and the nosedive of the financial markets in 2008, investment banking is still one of the most tried-and-true routes to Wall Street riches. Those who have hit the big time can expect to be in the middle of the action when it comes to IPOs, mergers, acquisitions, corporate lending, institutional trading and other big-ticket Wall Street transactions.

Entry-level investment banking associates do pretty well for themselves, often receiving salaries of $100,000 or more in their first year. Within four to five years, seasoned investment bankers rising through the ranks can easily earn $150,000 to $250,000. If you've got what it takes to stick around and land a key role in a huge deal, you could easily walk away with a multimillion dollar paycheck.

Sound like the right career for you? If so, then prepare to pay your dues. After getting the mandatory MBA from a top-tier business school, you can plan on moving to New York and working 80 to 100 hours per week as an analyst for the first couple of years. Make sure to brush up on your accounting and networking skills, too because both are crucial for differentiating yourself from your competition and climbing through the ranks.

Stockbroker to the Stars: Rubbing Elbows With America's Richest

Only in America does an NBA all-star's entourage include his stock broker. While that may seem a little extreme, there may be few people more important to an up-and-coming celebrity than an investment advisor and accountant. Because these celebrities receive large but intermittent paychecks and no guarantees of future employment, it's key for them to manage their windfalls wisely.

Is the paycheck worth tolerating the paparazzi? You bet it is. On average, investment advisors to high net worth individuals earn about 1% per year on the assets under their care. So, a broker who manages $5 million for 10 up-and-coming talents could easily earn $500,000 per year. Those numbers just keep increasing as your client list grows.

Before you set your sights on becoming the next Jerry Maguire of celebrity investing, you need to come to terms with one fact: you'll probably get yelled at—a lot. Athletes, actors and aristocrats tend to be high-performance people who are used to getting their way. If you're not living up to expectations, especially when they compare notes with their wealthy peers, you can bet you'll hear about it.

While a four-year college degree is more than sufficient to get you in the door at many local branches of large Wall Street firms, be prepared to duke it out with every other ambitious broker trying to make a name for themselves. If you plan on being the one to land the big-ticket clients, you'll have to learn how to network your way through the system of talent managers, lawyers and accountants. Because most celebrities have no interest in showing up at a Saturday morning investment workshop at your local brokerage branch, they rely heavily on referrals from their trusted circle of advisors.

For some people, the glory doesn't come from closing the big deal or hob-nobbing with the elite, it comes from being the best and from outperforming the pack. For that kind of glamour junky, there's no higher mountain to climb than managing billions of dollars in mutual fund assets. It's the Olympics of the investing world, where the winners receive high ratings for their funds instead of gold medals.

While the days of a single investment guru managing a fund seem to be on the decline, an entry-level position on a mutual fund management team can easily earn $200,000 to $400,000 per year before bonuses. Climb the ladder to become a senior team member or join one of the most prestigious mutual fund families, and pay can easily exceed $1 million dollars per year. Be sure to tuck that money away though—one major mistake or bad investment call and there's a good chance you'll never manage another fund again.

If you feel like you're ready to get behind the wheel of a few billion dollars of other people's nest eggs, you may need to start in the mailroom of your favorite mutual fund. It's not uncommon to see newly minted chartered financial analysts (CFAs) fetching coffee for the big guns, in between researching a couple hundred potential companies per week, of course. Mutual funds promote heavily from within their own ranks, most often favoring people who have proven they can work as part of a closely-knit team.

If there's a brass ring for those seeking Wall Street glamour, it's the household recognition of becoming a media personality. These are the folks who are giving market commentaries on the financial channels at the end of the day. They're the ones with the absurdly lucrative TV, radio and book deals. They are the go-to people for millions of investors and get paid astronomical amounts for simply sharing their opinions.

Considering that folks like Suze Orman and Jim Cramer can earn $10 million to $20 million in a bad year, it's not hard to see why Wall Street has become the new Hollywood for people craving the attention of a home viewing audience. But just like all true celebrities, fame comes with a price. The more visible the person, the more the public is interested in your personal life and unforgiving of your mistakes.

If you think you're ready for your close-up, you've got two main options for getting your foot in the door: First, you can get your journalism degree and work on finding an entry-level position behind the scenes at one of the major media networks. Like many other Wall Street jobs, the best positions are given to insiders who have paid their dues. You can plan on spending three to five years carrying cords and verifying sources before you get that first shot at some airtime. Another option is to become a local expert, parlaying your Wall Street wisdom into recurring guest spots on local TV or radio channels. Many of the biggest names were once hometown favorites who eventually grabbed the attention of one of the national morning shows.

Wall Street is still the greatest bastion of individual capitalism in the world and a place where determined individuals can work their way from answering the phones to calling the shots in just a matter of years. But the reward doesn't come easy, free or fairly.

You won't find Wall Street glamour simply by working on Wall Street. It also can't be attained through sheer luck, unless you choose to make your own. As the famous Roman philosopher Seneca said, ""Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity."" If Wall Street glamour is what you seek, never stop preparing for that moment of opportunity, when you can step in and prove you've got what it takes.",mainstream,M09bb0,big.foot

In the JJ six months of NN , NNS receive as JJ as CD NN doses of six different NNS , and by the NN they are 6 NNS old , a total of 25 doses from 10 NNS . MORE FROM MY NN NN DAILY : • Beyond NNS : 5 Things that Might Really VB NN • 10 Medical Myths that Just Wo n't VB Away In a 2011 survey , about a third of parents expressed concerns that their NN received too JJ NNS before age 2 , and too JJ NNS on a single day . Previous studies have VBN no link between the number of NNS a NN receives and their NN of several neurological conditions ( though these studies did not specifically consider NN ) . The JJ NN went a step further by looking at the link between a NN 's total exposure to antigens — the proteins in NNS that stimulate the NN 's immune system — and his or her NN of NN . The researchers looked at total antigen exposure rather than the total number of NNS kids received because , at the root of parents ' concerns is the idea that "" somehow they provide too much immunological stimulation , more so than a young NN 's immune system can handle , "" VBD NN researcher Dr. Frank DeStefano , of the Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention . ( The sheer number of NNS MD not be as good a measure of immunological response because NNS contain different numbers of antigens , and some protect against more than CD NN , DeStefano VBD . ) DeStefano and colleagues analyzed NN from about 250 NNS with NN and 750 NNS without NN , born between 1994 and 1999 . NNS with NN were exposed to about same total number of antigens as NNS without NN at ages 3 months , 7 months and 2 NNS . There was RB no difference between the CD groups in terms of the total number of antigens they were exposed to on a single day . "" Parental concerns that their NNS are receiving too JJ NNS in the JJ CD NNS of NN , or too JJ NNS at a single NN visit are not supported in terms of an increased NN of NN , "" the researchers write in the March 29 issue of the Journal of Pediatrics . Kids are exposed to JJ viruses and other pathogens that stimulate their immune systems in the same NN NNS do , and it's been estimated that kids MD theoretically receive thousands of NNS at once , the researchers VBD . Although NNS today receive more NNS than NNS in the mid-90s , the NNS used today contain fewer antigens . So while NNS in the mid-90s were exposed to between 3,000 and 15,250 antigens in the JJ CD NNS of NN , NNS today are exposed to about 315 antigens , the researchers VBD .

As case numbers have continued to fall , the NN has cautiously relaxed its guidelines , while signaling a shift to "" everyday quarantine "" measures , such as wearing masks and temperature checks at schools . NNS 's attitudes have RB relaxed , leading some officials to worry about complacency and a second wave of infections . The nightclub outbreak MD heighten those fears , but the NN has already responded aggressively , tracing and testing thousands of NNS in a matter of days . Last mile is the toughest Though testing NNS were quick to respond to the demand , rolling out the kits presented difficulties . Through February , demand for tests was still outpacing supply , and there were only enough kits to distribute to a select number of hospitals . Furthermore , hospitals struggled to administer the tests to potentially contagious patients safely and quickly — testing areas needed to be sanitised after each patient , JJ queues meant the NN MD spread while NNS waited in line , and NN workers were running low on protective gear . At Yangji Hospital , this RB led to exhausted staff , VBZ hospital director Sang Il Kim . "" RB when we did have kits , the waiting times were just too JJ for everybody to VB tested , so they MD have to VB to other hospitals , "" adds Yoona Chung , a NN in the hospital 's surgery department . According to Yangji's data , the hospital was conducting roughly 10 tests a day by late February — but JJ more were being turned away due to the wait . Other hospitals in Korea started experimenting with drive - through testing centres , where patients MD VB tested without leaving their cars . But Yangji Hospital is near a subway station in a crowded neighbourhood in southern Seoul ; for JJ of its patients , cars are n't an option . So , Kim devised the walk - in booths , which went into pilot operation on March 10 . Within days , the number of tests administered in a day had tripled . By the end of the month , the hospital MD handle more than 90 patients a day . Hospitals elsewhere in Korea and around the NN quickly adopted their own variations on the concept . A hospital in Busan had a similar idea independently but others have had NN from Kim ."

The NN of death was an overdose of the painkiller Tylenol . No autopsy was performed , and there was no suicide note . Less than a week after his apparent suicide , the FBI declared Ivins to have been the sole perpetrator of the 2001 Anthrax attacks , and the person who mailed deadly anthrax spores to NBC , the NNP York Post , and Sens . Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy . These attacks killed five NNS , closed down a Senate office building , caused a national panic , and nearly paralyzed the postal system . The FBI ’s six - NN investigation was the largest inquest in its history , involving 9,000 interviews , 6,000 subpoenas , and the examination of tens of thousands of photocopiers , typewriters , computers and mailboxes . Yet it failed to find a shred of evidence that identified the anthrax killer–or RB a witness to the mailings . With the NN of a task force of NNS , it VBD a flask of anthrax that closely matched –through its genetic markers –the anthrax used in the attack . This flask had been in the custody of Ivins , who had published no fewer than 44 scientific papers over three decades as a microbiologist and who was working on developing NNS against anthrax . As custodian , he provided samples of it to other NNS at Fort Detrick , the Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus , Ohio , and other facilities involved in anthrax NN .

Some say NN NN hard to find Some parts of the country are experiencing spot shortages of NN NN because of increased demand in a NN season that started earlier and is more severe than previous NNS . In Las Vegas , Celeste Tom tried six times before she VBD a NN shot for her boyfriend . "" I 'd been bugging him to VB a NN shot , but he kept putting it off , "" VBD Tom , 55 . The Smith 's Food and Drug Center where she got her shot was out . Her partner called his NN 's office , but they were out , too . Next she tried a Walgreens and then a CVS pharmacy ; no NN . She called another Smith's , but it MD administer NN only to NNS over 65 . On Monday , she VBD a Walgreens that had 10 doses left . "" I called RB when he got off work at 1 p.m. to make sure they still had some , and he finally went in . "" "" The bottom line is there 's NN out there , "" VBD Tom Skinner , a spokesman for the Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention . "" There MD be places where there are spot shortages , but there should be a little bit more coming , so NNS MD have to check around for it . "" It took Pam Copley a full day . The Staten Island , N.Y. , mom , 42 , tried her pediatrician , but the office had no appointments until February . She and daughter Colleen , 15 , got in line at a CVS , only to have the nurse come and and say she did n't have shots for anyone under 18 . After "" a bunch of phone calls , "" Copley VBD NN at an urgent - care clinic . They had to wait there for five hours , but it was worth it , she VBD . "" There 's lots of NN in the schools here RB now . U.S. NN NN manufacturers have increased the number of doses they expect to produce this NN to 145 million from previous estimates of 137 million , Skinner VBD . About 128 million doses have been shipped , and the "" vast majority "" of those have been used , he VBD . "" We had 112 million NNS vaccinated by the end of November . "" The CDC is working with the National Influenza NNP Summit , a coalition that monitors the NN and NN supply , to tell doctors and other NN care providers which distributors and NN manufacturers have NN available to order , Skinner VBD . "" Spot shortages are not due to any manufacturing issues , "" VBD Rita Chappelle , a spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration . It 's more an effect of a mild NN season last NN and a more severe NN this NN . "" Demand for the NN is high . "" Ordering NN NN can be a challenge , VBD Cameron Wolfe with the division of infectious diseases at Duke NNP School of Medicine in Durham , N.C . It requires "" pharmacies , physicians ' offices and clinics to pre-order their supply , and given the variability in the NN season , it is always an educated estimate of what you 'll actually need . "" There are CD main NN producers in the NNP NNPS , Sanofi US in Bridgewater , Conn. , and GlaxoSmithKline in Upper Merion , Pa . For the 2012 - 2013 NN season GlaxoSmithKline , RB VBN as GSK , produced about 25 million doses of NN NN . All those 25 million doses of NN NN are spoken for , and shipping will be finished by early to mid-February , GSK spokesman Robert Perry VBD . That does n't mean there 's no more NN NN available to doctors . Much of GSK 's production goes to medical suppliers that take orders from doctors ' offices , Perry VBD . The NN had the capacity to produce more NN shots , but 25 million doses was "" what customers VBD us they MD need , "" Perry VBD . In the past CD NNS about half of Americans VBP vaccinated . It 's tricky to estimate how much to produce because NN NN takes six to nine months to produce , so manufacturers have to plan production before all the orders are in . GSK began taking orders for this NN season in October 2011 . It will finish taking orders for next NN 's NN season next month . NN care providers base their estimates on previous NN 's demand . A single dose costs $ 7.90 to $ 8.85 wholesale , and doctors are careful not to order too much . It 's still not too late to VB vaccinated . NN seasons are unpredictable in their length , and it 's unclear whether NNS are still building or beginning to wane , according to the CDC . "" Being vaccinated with the NN NN each NN remains the best NN to prevent the NN , "" Chappelle VBD . NN on NN NN availability is at www.flu.gov."

His death is VBN to have followed on the heels of a raid by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) of his Bradstreet Wellness Center in Buford , Georgia ( update 27JUN2015 : the Georgia Drugs and Narcotics Agency is reported to have aided in the raid ) . A fisherman VBD Bradstreet ’s NN in a North Carolina river on Friday , June CD . Authorities in Rutherford County , North Carolina , VBP that he had a gunshot wound to the chest , “ which appears to be self - inflicted , ” according to the local newspaper , the Gwinnett Daily Post . The Post RB reports that That speculation has spread IN a NN through the community of NNS who are mourning the loss of a NN whom they viewed as a courageous crusader against mainstream medicine and who VBP , as Bradstreet argued , that the mercury in NNS causes NN ( the evidence emphatically indicates otherwise ) . According to his website , Bradstreet , whose own son is autistic , embraced a number of unproven or untested interventions for NN , including using stem cells in an overseas NN he chronicles , and hyperbaric oxygen therapy , which the FDA cracked down on in 2013 . He was VBN for his use of chelation therapy . As I ’ve written about here before , those who are attracted to NN theories to explain their NN have a tendency to VB NN all around them . With the death of Bradstreet , this tendency is emerging in force . A related fundraiser with the title “ Finding out the NN ” references an “ exhaustive investigation into the possibility of foul play . ” At last look , the funds raised were in the low five figures . Some seem to VB that the location of the wound suggests foul play , but about a fifth of suicides by gunshot involve a wound to the chest . A handgun RB was VBN in the river where Bradstreet ’s NN was discovered . Studies of NNS who are prone to subscribe to NN theories indicate that readers drawn to NN - related online NN tend to be more focused on what filters into their narrow , NN - oriented communities , reinforcing confirmation biases and adding fuel to the conspiratorial machine . In the US , “ conspiracist beliefs , ” which are widespread , correlate with being more likely to use alternative medicine and to shun mainstream medicine , RB to the point of being less likely to have an annual physical . Researchers call the internet a “ natural medium ” for the diffusion of NN theories , and the rapidity with which this NN spread and took hold is no exception ."

NNP Nixon had the Watergate scandal . NNP Bill NNP lied about his affair with Monica Lewinsky . And , in the JJ CD NNS Donald NNP was NN , the Washington Post reported he ’s made over 8,000 “ false or misleading claims ” to the American public . Still , it is rare to VB a headline declaring any NN or politician a liar . Why is that ? RB of all , what does it mean to lie ? The noun and verb lie are both recorded in Old English by the 900s . To lie is “ to speak falsely or utter NN knowingly , as with intent to deceive . ” More generally , to lie is “ to express what is false , convey a false impression . ” So , when a person lies , they are n’t just sharing false NN , they ’re doing it with the sinister intent of getting others to VB misleading NN . If someone does this habitually , then we MD call them a liar , “ a person who tells lies . ” This word is RB attested to in the 900s . Why do n’t journalists use the word liar ? The main reason why JJ journalists avoid accusations of lying is because it is difficult to determine CD key word in that definition above : intent . If a lie is “ a false statement that is made with deliberate intent to deceive , ” then calling someone a liar means you VBP they are intentionally trying to mislead NNS . While JJ of us make that assumption about politicians , it ’s different when you ’re a member of the NN tasked with reporting the NN — not your own conclusions about it . David Greenberg , a professor of history and NN studies at Rutgers NNP and a contributing editor at Politico , wrote in 2017 that the NN declaring the NN a liar MD cross a serious line . That ’s not to say that it should never be done . Prior to the Watergate scandal , as Greenberg observed , a National Press Club report VBD Nixon guilty of “ an unprecedented , NN - wide effort to VB , restrict and conceal NN ” and “ discredit the press . ” Still , it was n’t until the Watergate NN broke and investigations proved Nixon ’s intent that the NN declared the NN a liar . If the NN wants to retain their credibility , Greenberg argued , they are JJ to hold RB from declaring NNP NNP , or anyone else , a liar . “ Though it MD seem fainthearted to use words IN ‘ falsehood ’ and ‘ untruth , ’ in the JJ run the press will have more influence if it avoids insinuating more than it can confidently assert to be true , ” he wrote . Should journalists use liar anyways ? On January 21 , 2019 , the Washington Post reported that , in the JJ CD NNS of his presidency alone , NNP made 8,158 false claims about the economy , immigration , trade , foreign policy , and other matters . In just CD instance in March 2019 , NNP wrongly identified Patrick Moore , a NN with early involvement in Greenpeace , as a cofounder of the organization in a tweet about him calling NN NN “ JJ NN . ” Greenpeace was quick to correct NNP on the fact that Moore was not a cofounder , but that did n’t VB the fact that JJ NNS were exposed to the tweet and MD have accepted the NN ’s words as true . Since the 2016 US presidential election , NNS have grown increasingly frustrated with the NN ’s NN of public figures who lie , with JJ concerned that we live in a post - NN society where facts have become irrelevant . And , it ’s not only NNP . That election brought us the Hillary NNP email scandal , during which NNP VBD she “ never received nor sent any material that was marked classified ” on her private email server as Secretary of NNP — a claim that Politifact characterized as false . During the 2016 presidential election , Politifact RB VBD that 84 percent of claims Ben Carson , now Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development , made since 2007 were false , including his assertion that there are a “ multitude ” of unnecessary NNS available to the public . Texas Senator Ted Cruz VBD lies about 66 percent of the NN in that NN frame , including that “ the federal NN is VBG after school districts , trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls . ” Blurring the lines between fact and fiction RB more , NNP has popularized the term JJ NN — not to call out actual JJ NN but to discredit anyone or anything perceived as unflattering to him . That strategy has been incredibly effective , and he has succeeded in creating an environment in which the NN is difficult to discern . JJ argue that the NN simply can’t tolerate this level of misinformation anymore . RB journalists are starting to call CD another out . In January , Esquire published an op -ed by journalist Dan Sinker called “ In 2019 , The NN Has to Do Better in Calling Out NNP ’s Sh*t [ edited ] . ” Sinker noted that journalists do n’t use words IN lie and liar because they ’re supposed to maintain a level of objectivity . Nonetheless , he added : Of course , being objective does n’t mean letting liars lie . “ Balance ” is n’t setting CD pundits up to argue over what everyone knows is a false statement . There ’s no bias in saying something is patently untrue if it is , in fact , patently untrue . In fact , saying things are n’t true from jump is kinda the most important part of the job . Some major NN organizations have indeed been using the word liar in content . In August 2018 , The NNP Yorker ran the headline “ It ’s True : NNP Is Lying More & He ’s Doing It On Purpose . ” In October , CNN published “ Donald NNP Lies And He ’s Doing A Lot More of It Lately . ” The Atlantic joined the call - out in November 2018 with a piece simply titled : “ The NNP ’s Lies . ” In the era of JJ NN , publications have to contend with the fact that any escalation on their part ( i.e. , calling someone a liar ) , RB comes with an escalation in the intense scrutiny the NN is already facing . The NN has the unique ability to speak NN to power , and that includes calling out politicians and not allowing them to VB away with lies . There MD be disagreement on where the liar line should be , but that does n’t VB the fact that we need to draw CD — RB if intent is tricky to determine .

A mother carries her sleeping NN into the waiting room , while a sick baby screams so loudly that the receptionist has difficulty making herself understood on the phone . Over in a corner , an assistant is preparing a combined NNS , mumps , rubella and chickenpox NN for the next patient . She carefully puts a needle and a syringe on a tray together some medical swabs , and then removes the NN from the fridge . It still needs to be drawn and diluted before being injected . The NNP NNP Organization recommends that all NNS have CD doses of the NN to ensure immunity from NNS . "" All of my NNS have been vaccinated against NNS , "" VBZ Dr Dieter Knöbl from behind his desk . Dr Knöbl , CD of three pediatricians who work here , has been treating NNS in this surgery for 20 NNS . Before that he spent 14 NNS on the pediatric ward of the Karlsruhe public hospital . He VBZ he 's seen so "" JJ NNS suffering from NNS and JJ from NNS complications "" that he always advises parents to vaccinate . The NNS complications Dr Knöbl is talking about include middle ear infections , pneumonia and NNS encephalitis . The latter is an inflammation of the brain , which can VB permanent brain damage and RB death . Another complication is the quite rare but fatal NN with the unwieldy name of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis ( SSPE ) . With SSPE , the NN slowly attacks the central nervous system . "" It 's as if the NNS have Alzheimer 's RB though they are young , "" Knöbl VBZ . "" As the NN progresses the infected NNS physically and mentally deteriorate . They can't speak , they are paralyzed and at the end , they just lie there and gasp for air . It is a wretched death . "" During his NN working at the hospital , Dr Knöbl experienced three NNS dying of SSPE and CD of pneumonia . NN complications are more common than JJ NNS VBP . Of the nearly three hundred NNS who caught NNS in an outbreak in Berlin in 2013 , more than a hundred ended up in hospital - that 's a hospitalization rate of more than 30 percent . On average , CD in a thousand NNS patients will develop encephalitis . In western NNS , about CD in three thousand NNS infected with NNS will die ( the figure is much higher in developing NNS , where added factors , such as malnutrition , can result in NNS fatality rates of up to 30 percent ) . To make matters worse , NNS is CD of the most contagious diseases on the planet . But JJ refuse to vaccinate Despite the risks , there are JJ parents who refuse to have their NNS vaccinated . Some NN 's surgeries in Germany refuse to take on NNS who have n't had all their jabs , saying it 's the only NN to protect their other patients . "" That is n't our philosophy , "" VBZ Dr Knöbl . He and his colleagues VBP that by turning away unvaccinated NNS the parents MD deliberately seek out doctors who share their opposition to NN . By keeping the parents coming to his surgery , he hopes there is a chance the doctors can win them over . "" In our experience , the younger the NN , the more worried the parents are about vaccinating , "" Dr Knöbl VBZ . "" But if you accept their fears and give them a bit of NN , most of them VBP their mind . "" In 1998 , the British medical NN Andrew Wakefield alleged the MMR ( NNS , mumps , rubella ) NN caused NN . Although Wakefield 's NN has since been discredited and withdrawn - and Wakefield has been struck off as a British medical practitioner - rumors of the link continue to abound . In addition , there are parents who are unwilling to VB their NNS getting encephalitis , which is a rare side - effect of the NN . At around a chance of CD - in - a - million , the NN is considerably less than the CD - in - a - thousand chance of developing encephalitis from NNS itself . But add these fears to the general public distrust of doctors , medicines and pharmaceutical NNS - which is more pronounced in the southern German NNS of Baden - Württemberg and Bavaria - together with those who simply forget to bring their NN for a follow - up jab and you have a significant number of NNS who are n't immunized . In Germany , the NNS immunization rate is 92 percent - in Baden - Württemberg it 's RB lower at 89 percent . This might sound IN a lot , but it is well below the 95 percent goal set by Germany and other European nations to eradicate the NN by 2015 . In 2013 , the then German NN minister Daniel Bahr raised the idea of mandatory NN as a NN of increasing the NNS NN rate . But Dr Günter Pfaff , the chief epidemiologist at the Baden - Württemberg NNP NNP Authority is n't convinced that such measures MD work in Germany . "" We probably MD have to use more NN to fight against opposition to mandatory NN than we MD use to convince NNS that NN is good , and that it MD be a benefit for their NNS , "" he VBZ from his office in Stuttgart . For Pfaff , defeating NNS in Germany is about minutely analyzing the data . He turns around a giant whiteboard covered with a map of the NN . It shows the NNS NN rate for every NN district . Some are dark blue - that 's good because it means the NN rate is more than 95 percent . Others are light blue - which is n't so good . "" You can VB there are a few communities , where there is quite a stark contrast between [ them and ] neighboring communities , and there is hardly another NN of explaining this than that the practice of provision of medical services varies from town to town , "" he VBZ . CD approach the NN NN authority ( Landesgesundheitsamt Baden - Württemberg ) is looking into is directly approaching doctors in villages and towns with low NN rates . It is something Dr Pfaff has tried in a few NNS . "" What we [ VB to do ] is ask the doctors ' did you notice that in your town vaccinations are much lower than in the neighboring village ? And how come ? We MD VB to draw your attention to this and we MD VB to talk to you about it , ' "" he VBZ . Another approach they have been using is publishing the NNS NN rates for villages and districts in community newsletters along with comparisons to neighboring places . This kind of specific , local NN has been VBN to VB more than public NN campaigns on a national level or in mainstream , national NN . Whatever the approach , it is possible to eradicate NNS . The Americas - both north and south - succeeded in 2002 . But Germany - CD of Europe 's most advanced NNS - still has a JJ NN to VB ."

The NN is marked by NNS that are similar to a common cold , as well as a characteristic red rash . Between 2000 and 2010 , the JJ incidence of NNS decreased by 66 % and the mortality caused by the NN decreased 74 % , according to a report published in the journal The Lancet . Less than CD decades ago , NNS was almost wiped out in the NNP NNPS , thanks to NNS . But recently , the NN has had a resurgence . Globally , the number of NNS has jumped 30 % due to NN hesitancy . More than 760 NNS of NNS were reported in the U.S. between Jan. 1 and NNP 3 , 2019 , according to Dr. Deepa Mukundan , a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at the NNP of Toledo Medical Center in Ohio . This is up from 372 NNS over the entire NN in 2018 and up from 120 NNS over the entire NN in 2017 , according to the Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention ( CDC ) . How contagious is it ? NN is caused by NN morbillivirus , a NN in the paramyxoviridae family . According to the CDC , the NNS NN settles in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person . When a person infected with the NN coughs , sneezes or exhales , the NN becomes airborne and can spread to other NNS . "" The NN can remain in the air for significant periods of NN , "" Mukundan VBD Live NNP . "" PRP can VB the NNS just by being in a room where a person with NNS has been , RB up to 2 hours after that person has left . "" Indeed , the NN is incredibly contagious — 90 % of NNS who are not vaccinated against NNS will become infected if they share NN with someone who has the NN . "" Another reason that it is transmitted so effectively is because the hallmark of NNS , the rash , only comes several days after someone is contagious , "" VBD Dr. Jennifer Lighter , a pediatric infectious NN specialist at NNP York NNP Langone NNP . Therefore , infected individuals can spread the NN for several days before realizing they 're ill . The contagious period lasts about four days before and four days after the rash appears . A person with NNS is likely to infect between 5 and 18 unvaccinated NNS , according to a 2019 review published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases . Most NNS of NNS VBP some combination of cough , runny nose , red eyes , high fever and tiny white to bluish spots in the mouth , VBD Dr. Aileen M. Marty , a professor of infectious diseases at Florida International NNP 's Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine in Miami . As the infection progresses , the characteristic red rash will develop . The rash typically looks IN JJ , red , JJ splotches on the NN . To test for NNS , a NN will examine the patient for telltale NNS , such as spots inside of the mouth and the NN rash . If the NN has any doubt , they MD order a NN test to confirm infection , according to the Mayo Clinic . Almost all NNS require NN by a NN . "" This is a NN where complications are common — complications such as ear infection ( acute otitis NN ) , diarrhea and dehydration , pneumonia , encephalitis and JJ death , "" Marty VBD Live NNP . "" In the NNP NNPS , CD to three of every 1,000 infected persons will die from [ NNS ] complications — which is better than in the Third NNP , where as JJ as CD to 15 per 100 infected persons die from NNS and its complications . "" Young NNS are much more susceptible to the NN . According to the Mayo Clinic , NNS kills 100,000 NNS a NN , most under the age of 5 . Pregnant women and those with a compromised immune system are RB at NN of severe complications . There is no specific drug for treating NNS . Instead , doctors treat the NNS . "" This means we provide / advise hydration , antipyretics ( e.g. , acetaminophen ) for comfort and fever NN , airway humidification in patients with respiratory tract involvement , "" Marty VBD . Though not licensed in the NNP NNPS for the NN of NNS , some pediatricians have used Ribavirin , an antiviral medication , to treat severe pneumonia caused by NNS , Marty added . To protect those who have been exposed to the NN but have not been vaccinated , a NN MD order a post - exposure NN . If given within 72 hours of exposure , the NN MD prevent the NNS . RB if it does n't prevent the NN , the vaccinated patient will only have a mild case of the NNS , according to the Mayo Clinic . Another NN to protect at - NN individuals is to inject them with immune serum globulin ( antibodies or proteins derived from the NN of donors with NNS immunity ) within six days of exposure to the NN . IN a NN , this NN can prevent NNS or make the onset less severe . For JJ NNS , recovering from the NNS includes resting at home until the NNS subside . It is important for patients to drink plenty of fluids to replace fluids lost during fevers . It MD RB be helpful to use a humidifier to relieve congestion and to block out bright lights that MD bother sensitive eyes , according to the Mayo Clinic . Once the NN has run its course , the person will be immune to the NN . However , the immune system MD be significantly weakened for up to 2 NNS after recovering from the NNS , according to Lighter . During this NN , NNS can be more susceptible to secondary viral and bacterial infections , which MD VB more complications than the original NNS infection . The best NN to prevent NNS is by NN . The CDC recommends 2 doses of the NN ; the JJ for those between 12 and 15 months of age and the second for NNS between 4 and 6 NNS of age . The NN is 97 % effective for those who receive both doses and about 93 % effective for those receiving CD . Getting the proper vaccinations not only protects the individual receiving the NN , it RB protects those who cannot be vaccinated : those allergic to components of the NN , those with a compromised immune system or those too young to receive the NN . "" NNS are CD of the most effective tools we have to protect public NN and prevent deaths around the NN , "" VBD Dr. Scott Lillibridge , an infectious NN expert and professor at the Texas A&M NNP NNP Center School of Public NNP . About 94 % of the U.S. population is vaccinated against NNS , according to Mukundan , although there are pockets of NNS who delay or refuse NNS . The groups of unvaccinated NNS make it difficult to VB the spread of NNS , she VBD . "" All NNS outbreaks in the U.S. start either with a visiting international traveler infected with NNS or from an unvaccinated U.S. resident returning from an international trip with a NN infection , "" Mukundan VBD . The infection is then spread to others in the community who are unvaccinated . Most NN NNS occur in locations with groups of unvaccinated individuals , according to the CDC . In 2000 , the U.S. declared that NNS was effectively eliminated in the country . But since then , the NN has been making a comeback , likely due to anti-vaxxers . "" The antivax movement is a small percentage of the population but they are loud and draw a lot of undue NN attention , "" Lighter VBD . Anti-vaxxers are driven by emotion rather than the NN behind the NNS , she VBD . Modern opposition to NNS is largely fueled by religious beliefs and the unwarranted concern that NNS are somehow linked to NN , among other reasons , according to the NNP & Rubella Initiative , a collaboration of the NN 's largest NN organizations that aims to eliminate NNS and rubella . Before the NNS NN approval in 1963 , an estimated 3 to 4 million NNS in the U.S. contracted the NNS per NN , with 400 to 500 dying from complications , according to the CDC . Introduction of the NN led to a greater than 99 % reduction in NNS NNS in the U.S. A wealth of NN has confirmed that there is no relationship between NNS and NN and has repeatedly validated the safety of the NNS NN . "" Protect yourself and your loved ones by making sure that they are up to date on the NNS NN , "" Mukundan VBD . "" Prevention , meaning NN , is always better than cure . "" • Find answers to frequently asked questions about NNS , from the San Francisco Department of Public NNP . • Learn more about the NNS NN from the U.S. Department of NNP and NNP Services . • Read about the NNP NNP Organization 's position on the NNS NN and their goal to eradicate NNS ."

Some of the NNS MD be given as part of a combination NN so that a NN gets fewer shots . Talk with your NN about which NNS your kids need . • HepB : Hepatitis B NN . Ideally , the JJ dose is given within 24 hours of birth , but kids not previously immunized can VB it at any age . Some low birth weight infants will VB it at 1 month or when they 're discharged from the hospital . • HepB : Second dose should be given 1 to 2 months after the JJ dose . • Hib : This third dose MD be needed , depending on the brand of NN used in previous Hib immunizations . • RV : This third dose MD be needed , depending on the brand of NN used in previous RV immunizations . • Influenza ( NN ) : The NN NN is recommended every NN for NNS 6 months and older : • Kids younger than 9 who VBP the NN NN for the JJ NN ( or who have only had CD dose before July 2019 ) will VB it in 2 separate doses at least a month apart . • Those younger than 9 who have had at least 2 doses of NN NN previously ( in the same or different seasons ) will only need 1 dose . • Kids older than 9 need only 1 dose . • The NN is given by injection with a needle ( the NN shot ) or by nasal spray . Both types of NN can be used this NN season ( 2019 –2020 ) because they seem to work equally well . Your NN will recommend which to use based on your NN 's age and general NN . The nasal spray is only for healthy NNS ages 2 –49 . NNS with weak immune systems or some NN conditions ( such as asthma ) and pregnant women should not VB the nasal spray NN . • HepA : Hepatitis A NN ; given as 2 shots at least 6 months apart • HPV : JJ papillomavirus NN , given in 2 shots over a 6 - to 12 - month period . It can be given as early as age 9 . For teens and young adults ( ages 15 – 26 in girls and boys both ) , it is given in 3 shots over 6 months . It 's recommended for both girls and boys to prevent genital warts and some types of cancer . • Tdap : Tetanus , diphtheria , and pertussis booster . RB recommended during each pregnancy a woman has . • Meningococcal conjugate NN : And a booster dose is recommended at age 16 . • Meningococcal B NN ( MenB ) : The MenB NN MD be given to kids and teens in 2 or 3 doses , depending on the brand . Unlike the meningococcal conjugate NN , which is recommended , the decision to VB the MenB NN is made by the teens , their parents , and the NN . • HepA can be given as early as 6 months of age to babies who will travel to a place where hepatitis A is common ( they will still need routine NN after their JJ birthday ) . It 's RB recommended for older kids who did not VB it in the past . • The MMR NN can be given to babies as young as 6 months old if they will be traveling internationally . These NNS should still VB the recommended routine doses at 12 – 15 months and 4 –6 NNS of age , but can VB the second dose as early as 4 weeks after the JJ if they will still be traveling and at NN . • The NN NN is especially important for kids who are at NN for NN problems from the NN . High - NN groups include , but are n't limited to , kids younger than 5 NNS old and those with chronic medical conditions , such as asthma , heart problems , sickle cell NN , diabetes , or HIV . • Pneumococcal NNS can be given to older kids ( age 2 and up ) who have conditions that affect their immune systems , such as asplenia or HIV infection , or other conditions , IN a cochlear implant , chronic heart NN , or chronic lung NN . • The meningococcal NNS can be given to kids as young as 8 weeks old ( depending on the NN brand ) who are at NN for a meningococcal infection , such as meningitis . This includes NNS with some immune disorders . Kids who live in ( or will travel to ) NNS where meningitis is common , or where there is an outbreak , RB should VB the NN . Note : An outbreak is when a NN happens in greater numbers than expected in a particular area . If you have questions about vaccinating your family during an outbreak , ask your NN care provider or contact your NN or local NN department ."

They have been interviewed on the BBC about the scheme - called Every Mind Matters . Here is the transcript . Q : How are you helping VB the message out there with Every Mind Matters ? Duke of Cambridge : So Every Mind Matters obviously is in its second guise now coming out - we got a lot of feedback from the NHS and from others that NNS were accessing the online plan , so we felt very strongly that now more than ever this was a vital tool and a vital service that NNS MD easily access at home to guide them and give them just some very basic tips to mind their mental NN , to mind their mental wellbeing through this process . I VBP again staying connected , staying positive and being able to talk to friends and family is so crucial and having just some tips and some ideas as to how to tackle some of these strange feelings and difficult circumstances we ’re finding ourselves in is really important , just to nudge us through these next few weeks . Duke of Cambridge : What I ’ve heard as well Tina is about the fact that in JJ of these NNS obviously NHS workers , frontline workers are used to dealing sadly with very sad situations , death and things IN that but I VBP the scale and the speed of what ’s VBG on in hospitals , bearing in mind RB the isolation , a lot of these patients are dying with no family members around them . I VBP for the NHS frontline workers that is very difficult , because they are there RB next to the bedsides , looking after and caring for each and every patient in a critical condition and I VBP they take away that NN and that sometimes that fear and loneliness that these patients have to VB through , they ’re the ones who absorb that and take it home to their families and I VBP again , I ’ve spoken about the attrition and the daily attrition rate of that happening to somebody is not normal and we ’re not super JJ any of us , so to be able to manage those emotions and that feeling is VBG to take some NN after all this is over as well . Q : Do you VB this will fundamentally VB who we are and what we value ? Duchess of Cambridge : Yeah , absolutely , I VBP what we ’re saying now is the NHS and the frontline workers are doing the most extraordinary job and that ’s really come to the forefront in the last few weeks and I VBP it ’s VBG to dramatically VB how we all value and VBP our frontline workers and I VBP that is CD of the main positives that you can take from this . They do an extraordinary job it does unrecognised daily and now I VBP all of us as a nation can really VB how hard they work and how vital their work is ."

Sara Cunial , the Member of Parliament for Rome denounced Bill Gates as a “ NN criminal ” and urged the Italian NNP to hand him over to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity . She RB exposed Bill Gates ’ agenda in India and Africa , along with the plans to chip the JJ race through the digital identification program ID2020 . As reported by GreatGameIndia earlier , in 2015 it were the Italians who exposed secret Chinese biological experiments with NNP . The NN , which was broadcast in November , 2015 , showed how Chinese NNS were doing biological experiments on a NNP connected NN believed to be NN , derived from bats and mice , asking whether it was worth the NN in order to be able to modify the NN for compatibility with JJ organisms . In an extraordinary seven - minute speech met with wide applause , Sara Cunial , the Member of Parliament for Rome VBD that Italy had been subjected to a “ Holy Inquisition of false NN . ” She roundly criticized the unnecessary lockdown imposed on her fellow Italians in the service of a globalist agenda . She urged fellow political leaders to desist in any plans to compel citizens to surrender themselves to compulsory NN - CD NN at the hands of the corrupt elite – whom she identified as the Deep NNP . Below is the transcription of the full speech delivered to the Italian Parliament by Sara Cunial , the Member of Parliament for Rome . Sara Cunial The Member of Parliament for Rome Speech delivered to the Italian Parliament NNP 2020 Hobbes VBD that absolute power does not come from an imposition from above but by the choice of individuals who feel more protected renouncing to their own freedom and granting it to a third party . With this , you are VBG on anesthetizing the minds with corrupted Mass NN with Amuchina ( a brand of disinfectant promoted by Mass NN ) and NLP , with words IN “ regime ” , “ to allow ” and “ to permit ” , to the point of allowing you to regulate our emotional ties and feelings and certify our affects . So , in this NN , Phase 2 is nothing else than the persecution / continuation of Phase 1 – you just changed the name , as you did with the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) . We have understood NNS , for sure , do n’t die for the NN alone . So NNS will be allowed to die and suffer , thanks to you and your laws , for misery and poverty . And , as in the “ best ” regimes , the blame will be dropped only on citizens . You take away our freedom and say that we looked for it . Divide et Impera ( Divide and Rule ) . It is our NNS who will lose more , who are ‘ raped souls ’ , with the NN of the so - called “ guarantor of their rights ” and of CISMAI ( Italian Coordination of Services against NN Abuse ) . In this NN , the NN to school will be granted only with a bracelet to VB them used to probation , to VB them used to slavery – involuntary NN and to virtual lager . All this in exchange for a push - scooter and a tablet . All to satisfy the appetites of a financial capitalism whose driving force is the conflict of interest , conflict well represented by the WHO , whose main financier is the well - VBN “ philanthropist and savior of the NN ” Bill Gates . We all VBP it , now . Bill Gates , already in 2018 , predicted a NN , simulated in October 2019 at the “ Event 201 ” , together with Davos ( Switzerland ) . For decades , Gates has been working on Depopulation policy and dictatorial NN plans on JJ politics , aiming to obtain the primacy on agriculture , technology and NN . Gates VBD , I quote exactly from his speech : “ If we do a good job on NNS , NN and reproduction , we can reduce the NN population by 10 - 15 % . Only a genocide can save the NN ” . With his NNS , Gates managed to sterilize millions of women in Africa . Gates caused a polio epidemic that paralyzed 500,000 NNS in India and still today with DTP , Gates causes more deaths than the NN itself . And he does the same with GMOs designed by Monsanto and “ generously donated ” to needy populations . All this while he is already thinking about distributing the quantum tattoo for NN recognition and mRNA NNS as tools for reprogramming our immune system . In addition , Gates RB does business with several multinationals that own 5G facilities in the USA . On this table there is the entire Deep NN in Italian sauce : Sanofi , together with GlaxoSmithKline are friends of the Ranieri Guerra , Ricciardi , and of the well - VBN virologist that we pay 2000 Euro every 10 minutes for the presentations on Rai ( Italian NN TV . She ’s probably talking about Burioni ) . Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline sign agreements with medical societies to indoctrinate future doctors , making fun of their autonomy of judgment and their oath . Hi-Tech multinationals , IN the Roman Engineering which is friend of the noble Mantoan , or Bending Spoons , of Pisano , which are there for NN and manage our personal NN datas in agreement with the European Agenda ID2020 of electronic identification , which aims to use mass NN to obtain a digital platform of digital ID . This is a continuation of the transfer of data started by Renzi to IBM . Renzi , in 2016 , gave a plus 30 % to Gates NNP Fund . On the Deep NNP table there are the NNS of Aspen , IN the Saxon Colao , who with his 4 - pages reports , paid 800 Euros / hour , with no scientific review , dictates its politics as a Bilderberg general as he is , staying away from the battlefield .

These diseases VBP almost half of all deaths worldwide of NNS under age 45 , killing over eight million NNS each NN and orphaning millions more . The NNP committed the NNP NNPS to addressing this terrible problem in his September speech to the NNP Nations General Assembly . Now the NNP is asking for foundations , pharmaceutical NNS , international agencies , and other governments to join us in this task , and he is announcing these specific elements of his Millennium Initiative : • A JJ financial commitment to purchase and deliver existing NNS in poor NNS . As Vice NNP Gore VBD the U. N. Security Council earlier this month , the Administration�s FY 2001 budget will include a proposed $ 50 million contribution to the NN purchase fund of the NNP Alliance for NNPS and Immunization ( GAVI ) . • Increased investments in NN in developing NNS . The NNP is calling on the NNP Bank and other multilateral development banks to dedicate an additional $ 400 million to $ 900 million annually of their low - interest - rate loans to expand immunization , prevent and treat infectious diseases , and build effective delivery systems for other basic NN services . These investments are as central to JJ progress as investments in education and physical infrastructure , and they MD build on the JJ focus on basic NN services that we have supported as part of the Highly Indebted Poor NNPS ( HIPC ) debt initiative . This proposed shift in existing resources does not require additional U.S. budget expenditures . • A significant increase in basic NN on diseases that affect developing nations . The Administration�s FY 2001 budget for the National Institutes of NNP includes a sharp step - up in NN critical to the development of NNS for malaria , tuberculosis , and HIV / AIDS . • A JJ tax credit for sales of NNS for malaria , tuberculosis , and HIV / AIDS to accelerate the invention and production of these NNS . Because developing NNS often cannot afford to buy NNS , the market provides little incentive for pharmaceutical NNS to develop NNS for diseases that disproportionately affect those NNS . This tax credit MD provide such an incentive , because every dollar paid by a qualifying organization to buy a qualifying NN MD be matched by a dollar of tax credits � representing up to $ 1 billion of additional funding for future NN purchases . The NNP is calling on other governments to make similar purchase commitments , so that we can ensure a future market for these critically needed NNS . Infectious Diseases Pose a Mounting JJ and JJ Burden on Developing NNS � And a Threat to Our NN As Well . • More than eight million NNS die each NN of centuries - old diseases IN malaria , tuberculosis , and respiratory and diarrheal diseases . Deaths from the modern scourge of AIDS are climbing rapidly . Altogether , as JJ NNS die of infectious diseases each NN as the total number of combatants who perished in NNP War I . • In an interconnected and highly mobile NN , NN crises in other NNS are a threat to everyone . We have seen this with HIV / AIDS , with the resurfacing of tuberculosis , and with the outbreak last NN of West Nile encephalitis in NNP York . According to the NNP NNP Council , during the past 50 NNS , at least five times as JJ Americans have died from communicable diseases that have come from the developing NN than have died in military conflicts . NNS Are CD of the Most Cost - Effective Ways to Improve the Well - Being and Productivity of the Poorest NNS � And Medicines and Other Basic NN Services Are a Necessary Complement . • It costs about $ 17 to immunize a NN , but millions of NNS die each NN of diseases that MD be prevented by existing NNS . Indeed , NNS in developing nations are 10 times more likely to die of a NN - preventable NN than NNS in developed nations . And these tragedies occur in spite of the enormous efforts of UNICEF and others to vaccinate NNS , which save 3 million lives each NN . • Highly effective NNS do not yet exist for malaria , TB and AIDS , which take over 5 million lives each NN . But developed nations have the scientific and technological capacity to make JJ NNS possible . For example , recent work on genetic sequencing , including the JJ genome , will open vast possibilities . • Another NN investment with very high returns is simple preventive and curative services . Providing this basic NN care together with NNS MD save millions of lives each NN . A $ 50 Million Contribution to GAVI to Buy NNS For NNS � Which Will Save Lives Now and Create Confidence that a Market for JJ NNS Will Exist in the Future . • GAVI , the NNP Alliance for NNPS and Immunization , was formed as a collaborative effort of UNICEF , the NNP NNP Organization ( WHO ) , the NNP Bank , private foundations , bilateral aid agencies ( including the U.S. Agency for International Development ) , industry representatives , and developing NNS . GAVI established the � NNP Fund for Children�s NNPS � with an initial grant of $ 750 million over 5 NNS from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation . The formal launch of GAVI , and the official announcement of the Gates gift , will occur shortly in Davos , Switzerland . • A U.S. contribution will VB to purchase NNS for Hepatitis B , Haemophilus Influenzae B ( Hib ) , and Yellow Fever , along with related safe delivery equipment such as auto - destruct syringes . To ensure that GAVI�s NN purchases complement , rather than replace , existing NN efforts , they will be conditional on a country achieving 50 percent coverage of the DTP ( diptheria - tetanus - pertussis ) NN , which is included along with NNS and polio in the existing EPI ( Expanded Program for Immunization ) . • A U.S. contribution will hopefully catalyze significant contributions from other NNS and foundations . It will RB add crucial credibility to the international community�s commitment to provide a market for JJ NNS when they are developed . We Must Shift Existing International Resources Toward Building NNP Infrastructure in Poor NNPS That Can Deliver NNS and Medicines and Provide Essential Basic NNP Services . • The NNP Bank and other multilateral development banks ( MDBs , such as the African Development Fund ) lend money on highly favorable terms to the world�s poorest NNS . Today , roughly $ 1 billion to $ 1 - 1/ 2 billion of this so - called � concessional funding � is devoted to NN care each NN . The Administration proposes to increase that amount by $ 400 million to $ 900 million per NN , with a focus on : • prevention of diseases using basic measures such as NN and condoms for AIDS , treated bed nets for malaria , and stronger systems for containing TB ; • NN of diseases , including common respiratory and diarrheal infections ; and • The Administration is exploring ways to use the HIPC debt reform to support this part of the Millennium Initiative . CD possibility is to make an increase in NN rates CD of the performance targets monitored in the HIPC progress reports . This MD be accompanied by debtor NNS � agreements to include specific improvements in NN delivery systems as priority uses of debt relief proceeds . We RB expect that all Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers that are prepared for HIPC candidates will discuss the adequacy of budget resources and suggested policy reforms devoted to basic NN care . • This re-direction of resources supports the Administration�s overall strategy for JJ development , which emphasizes poverty reduction and gives a central role to �global public goods � � IN NN or the environment � in which positive actions taken in CD country benefit other NNS as well . To meet this objective , these funds should not come from spending on other basic JJ programs , such as education and NN care . • This aspect of the Millennium Initiative does not require a JJ budgetary commitment by the NNP NNPS ( or other donor NNS ) . However , the U.S. ability to influence the direction of MDB lending and the use of HIPC proceeds depends crucially on meeting our existing commitments to these aid programs . We will work with other G - 8 finance and development ministries to refine this proposal . • A conservative estimate suggests that if basic NN care including immunization were made broadly available , up to 2 million children�s lives MD be saved each NN . Higher Funding for Basic Scientific NNP Through the National Institutes of NNP ( NIH ) and Elsewhere Will Hasten the Development of NNS for Malaria , TB , and AIDS . • The Administration�s FY 2001 budget for NIH includes a significant increase in NN critical to creating NNS for these diseases . For malaria and TB , this increase will build on recent advances in the genetic sequencing of these diseases , which have set the stage for major breakthroughs in NN development . • Funding for NIH malaria NN NN will increase more than 10 percent over the FY 2000 level . Future NN will range from pre-clinical studies aimed at improving our understanding of the malaria parasite , through the development of NN candidates , to clinical trials judging NN efficacy and safety . NIH will RB expand its collaboration with NNS in malaria - endemic regions , especially in Africa , to strengthen those regions � capacity for conducting clinical trials of malaria NNS in the future . • NIH NN on a tuberculosis NN will receive over 40 percent more funding than in FY 2000 and more than double the FY 1999 level . NIH will focus on studying the body�s defense mechanisms against TB , and developing and studying NN candidates . Through its Tuberculosis NNP Unit , NIH supports an international multi-disciplinary team to translate advances in basic NN into JJ tools for fighting TB . • NIH funding for AIDS NN NN will increase substantially in FY 2001 and will have more than doubled since FY 1997 . These additional resources will allow NIH to accelerate basic NN on developing NN candidates and to significantly expand testing of potential NN candidates in both developing and developed NNS . The JJ NNP NNP Center on the NIH campus , which will be occupied this summer , will receive a sizeable increase in funding for the development and pre-clinical testing of HIV NN candidates . • The Administration is providing strong support for the path - breaking NN on infectious diseases being conducted by U.S. military NNS , including the opening ( in October 1999 ) of the Walter Reed Army Institute of NNP / Naval Medical NNP Center . Working in close collaboration with NNS worldwide , military NNS have developed and tested successful NNS against Japanese encephalitis and hepatitis A � and they are working to create NNS and medicines to protect service NNS , travelers , and millions of others from malaria , HIV / AIDS , and other infectious diseases . A JJ Tax Credit MD Effectively Provide Up to $ 1 Billion for Future NN Purchases , Speeding the Invention and Production of JJ NNS . • Current tax law provides substantial incentives for pharmaceutical NN and development , including the NN and experimentation ( R&E ) tax credit , the orphan drug tax credit , and an enhanced deduction for charitable contributions of certain products . Nonetheless , pharmaceutical NNS MD be reluctant to invest in developing NNS for diseases that primarily afflict NNS in poor NNS , because little or no paying market exists in those NNS . • Under the proposal , the seller of a qualified NN MD claim a tax credit equal to 100 percent of the amount paid by a qualifying organization that received a �credit allocation� by the U.S. Agency for International Development ( AID ) . The tax credit MD match the qualified organizations � expenditures dollar - for - dollar , thereby doubling their purchasing power . A qualifying NN MD be a JJ NN that received FDA approval for use against malaria , tuberculosis , HIV / AIDS , or any infectious NN that causes over 1 million deaths annually worldwide . • For 2002 through 2010 , AID MD designate up to $ 1 billion of NN sales as eligible for the credit . This tax credit MD be limited to JJ NNS developed to fight these terrible diseases . The credit MD provide a specific and credible commitment to purchase future NNS at reasonable prices . Together with similar commitments from foundations and other governments , it MD provide a critical and powerful incentive to accelerate NN NN and development ."

""_''","The NNS , mumps and rubella ( MMR ) NN is not linked to development of NN spectrum disorders , RB among NNS considered to be at NN , a JJ JJ NN finds . Among nearly 100,000 NNS , receipt of the MMR NN did not increase the NN for NN spectrum disorder ( ASD ) , regardless of whether kids were at higher NN because an older sibling already had the condition , researchers write in JAMA . "" RB for NNS who are high - NN , the NN does not play a role , "" VBD lead author Dr. Anjali Jain of healthcare consulting firm The Lewin Group in Falls Church , Virginia . "" We do n’t VB what does unfortunately , but it ’s not the MMR NN . "" The results should be reassuring , she VBD . NN spectrum disorder is a range of NNS that often includes difficulties with communication and JJ interaction , according to the U.S. National Institute of Mental NNP . It 's MD RB include restricted and repetitive behaviors . The 1998 NN that claimed to find a connection between the MMR NN and ASD was later debunked . The Lancet , the medical journal that originally published it , withdrew it . Studies continue to vouch for the safety of the NN . Still , some NNS continue to VB that the NN is connected to ASD . Parents of NNS with ASD MD RB VB there is a genetic component , and so they decline to vaccinate their other NNS , Jain and colleagues noted in their report in the Journal of the American Medical Association . For the JJ NN , the researchers used insurance claims data on 95,727 NNS followed from birth to at least age five between 2001 and 2012 . They RB had data on the NNS 's older siblings . Overall , about 2 percent of the NNS had an older sibling with ASD . Those NNS were more likely to VB on to develop ASD themselves whether they were vaccinated or not , according to the report . The NN did n't increase their NN , the researchers say . For example , among high - NN five NN olds , ASD developed in 23 of 269 who were n't vaccinated ( 8.6 percent ) , compared to 30 of 796 ( 3.8 percent ) who received CD doses of the MMR NN . Among kids not at high NN of ASD , 7,735 were unvaccinated at age five and 56 ( 0.7 percent ) were diagnosed with the condition . That compared to 244 of 45,568 NNS ( 0.5 percent ) who received CD MMR doses . Furthermore , NNS with an older sibling with ASD were significantly less likely to have received the MMR NN in the JJ place . By age five , about 92 percent of the NNS without ASD in the family had received at least CD MMR dose . By comparison , only 86 percent of NNS with an older sibling with ASD had been vaccinated by that age . "" I VBP it ’s important to show that the degree of undervaccination in the families with NNS with NN spectrum disorder was significant , "" Jain VBD Reuters NNP . Alongside the lack of association between the NN and ASD , the undervaccination rate deserves attention , she VBD . Roughly a dozen studies have shown that age of ASD onset and its severity do not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated NNS , wrote Dr. Bryan King , program director of the NNP Center at Seattle NNP 's Hospital , in an editorial accompanying the JJ NN . The JJ NN , King added , now shows that "" the NN of ASD recurrence in families does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated NNS . """

During a live interview on Sirius XM radio , the nation ’s top NN VBD that data from the NNP NNP Organization ( WHO ) , U.S. Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention ( CDC ) , and Bill Gates ( “ King NNP ” ) MD be shelved in favor of real data : “ What the American NNS need to VB now is we actually have data and so we ’re tracking that data . ” Alarmingly high WHO estimates of the number of NNS in this country considered at NN from getting and dying from the Wuhan NN have proven to be grossly inaccurate . Hundreds of thousands of Americans have not succumbed to the novel strain of infection , as these self - styled experts insisted . It has been confirmed that various NN reporting agencies have artificially inflated the real number of diagnosed NNS and deaths directly due to a NN - CD infection . The reason behind this charade is to generate fear , make the masses compliant with NNP NNP Order directives , and topple the U.S. economy . A growing number of independent international NN experts are contradicting the alarmism being spread around the NN in the face of a bad case of the NN . Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi , a microbiology specialist , professor at the Johannes Gutenberg NNP in Mainz , Germany , and head of the Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hygiene , VBD : “ We are afraid that 1 million infections with the JJ NN will lead to 30 deaths per day over the next 100 days . But we do not realize that 20 , 30 , 40 or 100 patients positive for normal coronaviruses are already dying every day . ” [ emphasis added ] Dr. Bhakdi called the NN ’s NNP - CD response measures “ grotesque , absurd and very dangerous , ” and added that they are shortening the NN expectancy of millions of NNS . The panic is a fraud , according to the much - cited NN scientist : “ The horrifying impact on the NN economy threatens the existence of countless NNS . The consequences on medical care are profound . Already services to patients in need are reduced , operations canceled , practices empty , hospital personnel dwindling . All this will impact profoundly on our whole society . “ All these measures are leading to self - destruction and collective suicide based on nothing but a spook . ” Dr. Joel Kettner , a professor of Community NNP Sciences and Surgery at Manitoba NNP in Canada , former Chief Public NNP Officer for Manitoba province , and Medical Director of the International Centre for Infectious Diseases , VBD : “ I have never seen anything IN this , anything anywhere near IN this . I ’m not talking about the NN , because I ’ve seen 30 of them , CD every NN . It is called influenza . And other respiratory illness viruses , we do n’t always VB what they are . But I ’ve never seen this reaction , and I ’m trying to understand why . ” JJ observers agree with Dr. Kettner ’s assessment of the message being broadcast by the globalist NN nazis : “ I worry about the message to the public , about the fear of coming into contact with NNS , being in the same NN as NNS , shaking their hands , having meetings with NNS . I worry about JJ , JJ consequences related to that . ” Adams VBD Alex Marlow , host of Breitbart NNP Daily , that the real numbers show that businesses are safe to re-open in NNP and June . The NWO NN nazis VBP U.S. business owners to fail by keeping them idle for six months or more . They are trying to push a national NN ID card that MD determine whether or not citizens can travel or renew their driver ’s licenses . The Surgeon General VBD that , based on actual test data rather than doomsday prophesies based on theoretical computer simulations , U.S. businesses “ in some places ” can expect to resume operations in NNP or June . Locations hardest hit by the contagion , however , will continue living with the current medical lockdown : “ Other places wo n’t ; it will be piece by piece , bit by bit , but will be data - driven , ” advised Adams . Frustrated citizens around the U.S. are gathering at their statehouses to voice their opposition to the prolonged enforced idleness and ridiculously unfair JJ rules on what is nonessential , including tools and seeds , from petty bureaucrats enjoying expanded powers under the national emergency ."

At the forefront of that search stands Dr. David Baltimore , chairman of the National Institute of Health's AIDS NNP NNP Committee . Currently NN of the California Institute of Technology as well , Baltimore won the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine . Betsey Arledge , producer of the NOVA film "" Surviving AIDS , "" interviewed a cautiously optimistic Baltimore on the current NN of the search for a NN . NOVA : Can you give me a sense of the magnitude of the AIDS epidemic at this NN ? Baltimore : The AIDS epidemic in this country is a serious issue , but it's not a major public NN disaster the NN it is abroad . In the NN today there are something IN 34 million infected NNS , and more NNS are being infected every minute . On the scale of any public NN issue in the NN , this is CD of the major ones . There are more NNS dying of AIDS than of almost any other infectious NN , with tuberculosis and malaria being in the same ballpark . It 's a horrendous situation . ( VB AIDS in Perspective . ) NOVA : Do you VB we 're getting a little complacent in this country ? Baltimore : I 'm impressed that AIDS remains a very noted NN in the NNP NNPS . It 's noted in the newspapers all the NN — what 's VBG on in the NN and in the country . There is very complete coverage of how good the drugs are and where the NN program stands . I do n't VB we 've allowed it to fall off the radar screen . And we do far more AIDS NN than the whole rest of the NN ; in the NN area alone , we do probably 90 percent of the NN . NOVA : Can you give me a sense of the amount of effort — not just money , but intellectual effort — that has gone into trying to find a NN over the past 10 or 15 NNS ? Baltimore : When H.I.V. was RB discovered , the JJ thing that the then -Secretary of what became the U.S. Department of NNP and NNP Services VBD was , "" We will have a NN in short order . "" She was wrong about that , but it shows that from the very JJ moment a NN was on NNS 's minds . Indeed , there has been a significant effort to make a NN from the very JJ day . I VBP NNS thought it MD be simple , because we 'd made NNS for so JJ different viruses . The polio NN is effective because , for the most part , our bodies naturally fight this NN . This is not the case with HIV . The thing that worried me at the NN — and it has turned out to be the biggest worry — was that if it were possible to make a NN , why does n't the NN ordinarily fight off the NN ? Most viruses we fight off very well , including polio and RB smallpox . A certain fraction of NNS MD be maimed or killed by those viruses , but the much larger fraction of NNS VBP over them . That 's not true for H.I.V . We knew that from very early on . At RB we thought it might be that JJ NNS MD be killed by it , and then we began to realize that almost everybody who had the infection was potentially VBG to be killed by it . That 's fundamentally different than other viruses . And that fundamental difference was a red flag . The initial impetus that we'd be able to do it , it 's around the corner , was just all wrong . NOVA : So the search for a NN has been a real struggle ? Baltimore : It 's been an enormous struggle , because the obvious things did n't work , and NNS got very frustrated by that . The next question became : Where do you turn ? What 's not obvious ? What can we do ? That involved bringing a whole different level of NNS into the discussion . Not the ordinary NNS who make NNS , but NNS whose scientific focus is in other areas of immunology , of infectious NN — basic NNS . So it 's been a ramping up process to VB more and more NNS involved and thinking about it . Perhaps the most important role of the committee I 'm now heading is to galvanize the scientific community to find JJ routes in thinking about a NN , so that maybe we can find a NN through some very non-traditional approach . NOVA : An international team of NNS announced recently that they had traced the origin of the AIDS NN to a subspecies of chimpanzee in Africa . If this report is verified , how will it VB in the search for a NN ? Baltimore : In NN , it will not have much effect on the search for a NN . However , it tells us a lot about why HIV is so hard to counter . It is not a NN that is native to the JJ NNS , and therefore it is continually mutating in an effort to adapt . Most JJ viruses are well - controlled by the JJ immune system , because they have evolved with it , and the CD opposing forces are in a steady - NN . We cannot wait until we and HIV evolve to being comfortable with each other . We must devise a NN , effectively short - circuiting the usual process of adaptation . NOVA : Who are the so - called JJ - term non-progressors , and how do they fit into the search ? Bob Massie is a JJ - term non-progressor . His immune system 's ability to fight HIV is inspiring a JJ approach to fighting AIDS . Baltimore : There is a small group of H.I.V.- infected NNS — maybe five percent — who do n't VB any NNS and whose NN is maintained at a very low level . If we MD find out the secret behind that , maybe we MD replicate it in a NN . So far we have n't VBN the secret , but there are good correlations . These NNS have a good cytotoxic T lymphocyte response , they have a good helper T cell response . [ Cytotoxic T lymphocytes , otherwise VBN as CTLs or CD8 killer T - cells , are cells involved in immune defense that can kill other cells infected by viruses . So - called CD4 helper T cells are essential for triggering antibody production , activating CTLs , and initiating other immune responses . ] So that VBZ if we can make those a focus of activity , maybe we can design a NN around those principles . But there 's no certainty that those are the key issues . There is a balance of three things : whether the NN that those NNS have is different than the NN other NNS have ; whether their immune system is somehow responding to it differently than other NNS 's immune systems are ; and whether their genetics are different . Are they inherently able to fight the NN ? Or is it something that 's learned and that therefore we MD teach other NNS to do ?

The NN is called NVX - CoV2373 and is from a US biotech NN , Novavax . The trial will be carried out across Melbourne and Brisbane , and is the JJ JJ trial of a NN specifically for NNP - CD to take place in Australia . This NN is actually based on a NN that was already in development for influenza . But how might it work against NNP - CoV - 2 , the NN that causes NN - CD ? Read more : MD BCG , a 100 - NN - old NN for tuberculosis , protect against NN ? NNS trigger an immune response by introducing the cells of our immune system to a NN in a safe NN , without any exposure to the pathogen itself . All NNS have to do CD things . The JJ is make our immune cells bind to and “ eat up ” the NN . The second is to activate these immune cells so they ’re prepared to fight the current and any subsequent threats from the NN in question . We often add molecules called adjuvants to NNS to deliver a danger signal to the immune system , activate immune cells and trigger a strong immune response . Read more : Revealed : the protein ' spike ' that lets the 2019 - nCoV NN pierce and invade JJ cells The Novavax NN is what we call a “ subunit ” NN because , instead of delivering the whole NN , it delivers only part of it . The element of NNP - CoV - 2 in this NN is the spike protein , which is VBN on the NN of the NN . By targeting a particular protein , a subunit NN is a great NN to focus the immune response . However , protein by itself is not very good at binding to and activating the cells of our immune system . Proteins are generally soluble , which does n’t appeal to immune cells . They VBP something they can chew on . So instead of soluble protein , Novavax has assembled the NNP - CoV - 2 spike protein into very small particles , called nanoparticles . To immune cells , these nanoparticles look IN little viruses , so immune cells can bind to these pre-packaged chunks of protein , rapidly engulfing them and becoming activated . The Novavax NN RB contains an adjuvant called Matrix - M. While the nanoparticles deliver a modest danger signal , Matrix - M can be added to deliver a much stronger danger signal and really wake up the immune system . The Novavax NN for NNP - CoV - 2 is based on a NN the NN was already developing for influenza , called NanoFlu . The NanoFlu NN contains similar parts – nanoparticles with the Matrix - M adjuvant . But it uses a different protein in the nanoparticle ( hemagglutinin , which is on the outside of the influenza NN ) . In October last NN , Novavax started testing NanoFlu in a phase III clinical trial , the last level of clinical testing before a NN can be licensed . This trial had 2,650 volunteers and researchers were comparing whether NanoFlu performed as well as Fluzone , a standard influenza NN . Read more : Where are we at with developing a NN for NN ? An important feature of this trial is participants were over the age of 65 . Older NNS tend to have poorer responses to NNS , because immune cells become more difficult to activate as we age . This trial is ongoing , with volunteers to be followed until the end of the NN . However , early results suggest NanoFlu can generate significantly higher levels of antibodies than Fluzone – RB given the older NNS in the trial . Antibodies are small proteins made by our immune cells which bind strongly to viruses and can stop them from infecting cells in the nose and lungs . So increased antibodies with NanoFlu should result in lower rates of infection with influenza . These results were similar to those released after the phase I trial of NanoFlu , and suggest NanoFlu MD be the superior NN for influenza . So the big question is – will the same strategy work for NNP - CoV -2 ? The JJ phase I / II trial will enrol around 131 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 59 to assess the NN ’s safety and measure how it affects the NN ’s immune response . Some volunteers will not receive the NN , as a placebo NN . The rest will receive the NN , in a few different forms . The trial will test CD doses of protein nanoparticles – a low ( 5 microgram ) or a high ( 25 microgram ) dose . Both doses will be delivered with Matrix - M adjuvant but the higher dose will RB be tested without Matrix -M . All groups will receive CD shots of the NN 21 days apart , except CD group that will just VB CD shot . This design enables researchers to ask four important questions : • None can the NN induce an immune response ? • None if so , what dose of nanoparticle is best ? • None do you need adjuvant or are nanoparticles enough ? • None do you need CD shots or is CD enough ? Read more : NN anti-vaxxers are n’t a huge threat yet . How do we keep it that NN ? While it ’s not yet clear how the NN will perform for NNP - CoV - 2 , Novavax has reported it generated strong immune responses in animals . And we VBP NanoFlu performed well and had a good safety profile for influenza . NanoFlu RB seemed to work well in older adults , which MD be essential for a NN for NN - CD . We eagerly await the JJ set of results , expected in a couple of months – an impressive turnaround NN for a clinical trial . If this initial NN is successful , the phase II portion of the trial will begin , with more participants . The Novavax NN joins at least nine other NN candidates for NNP - CoV - 2 currently in clinical testing around the NN ."

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] He RB founded the Good NNP NNP Foundation , which aimed to combine Christian beliefs with his medical practice . [ 7 ] Bradstreet obtained a Florida medical license in 1984 . He received a Bachelor of NNP degree from the NNP of South Florida in 1976 , where he RB went to medical school beginning three NNS later . His postgraduate NN focused on aerospace medicine , and he received his training in this field from Wilford Hall Medical Center . He was an adjunct professor of NN development and neuroscience at the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine in Tempe , Arizona . [ 8 ] Bradstreet published NN NN , which he claimed indicated NNS as a NN , in the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons , which is not indexed by PubMed . This NN claimed that autistic NNS had a higher NN burden of mercury , [ 9 ] and that three autistic NNS had NNS RNA in their cerebrospinal fluid . [ 10 ] The Institute of Medicine has rejected any relationship between NNS and NN . [ 11 ] Bradstreet treated an autistic NN named Colten Snyder ( CD of the test NNS in the NN omnibus trial ) with chelation therapy on the premise of removing mercury from his NN , in spite of the fact that hair , NN , and urine tests had failed to show he exhibited abnormal levels of mercury . [ 12 ] Over an eight - NN period , Colten visited Bradstreet 's office 160 times . [ 13 ] Stephen Barrett has stated , "" It appears to me that Bradstreet decides which of his nonstandard theories to apply and records diagnoses that embody them , "" and describes Bradstreet 's mercury provoked tests as "" phony "" . [ 12 ] Peter Hotez characterized Bradstreet 's proposal to treat NN with chelation therapy as "" dangerous . "" [ 6 ] In an interview with the Chicago Tribune , Bradstreet defended the use of intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) as an NN NN , saying , "" Every kid with NN should have a trial of IVIG if money was not an option and IVIG was abundant . "" [ 14 ] Bradstreet RB published NN regarding the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for NN , [ 15 ] some of which concluded it was ineffective , [ 16 ] as well as a paper arguing that autistic NNS have an increased vulnerability to oxidative stress . [ 17 ] Further treatments Bradstreet used on autistic NNS included the controversial protein GcMAF , with which he claimed to have treated 600 NNS . [ 18 ] In an article for an anti-vaccine magazine , Bradstreet endorsed stem cell therapy as an NN NN . [ CD ] Bradstreet was VBN dead from a gunshot wound to the chest in the Broad River in Rutherford County , North Carolina in June 2015 , after his Buford , Georgia medical office was raided by the FDA in connection with an investigation into GcMAF treatments . [ 4] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] At the NN of his death , he lived in Braselton and ran his medical practice in Buford .

Since last autumn , more than 150 NNS have been recorded in Rockland County , a NNP York suburb home to a JJ ultra-Orthodox Jewish community where there has been some resistance to vaccinations . The vast majority of US NNS allow families to opt out of getting vaccinated if they object on religious grounds and parents seem to take advantage of these rules . Researchers have VBN that broad philosophical and religious exemptions to NN requirements are associated with higher rates of unvaccinated NNS . But this NN ’s outbreaks are now raising public NN questions about why NNS allow such exemptions . Here is how religious exemptions work : What is a religious exemption to a NN , and which US NNPS have them ? Religious exemptions allow parents to opt their NNS out of mandated NN policies if they object to the NN for religious reasons and if they follow the NN ’s opt - out process . Almost every NN , plus Washington DC , allows for a religious exemption beginning at least in kindergarten . Four NNS do not : California , West Virginia , Mississippi and Arizona . Each NN has its own rules regarding vaccinations for NNS who attend public schools . In addition to the religious exemption , all 50 NNS , plus Washington DC , allow exceptions for medical reasons . Examples include a NN who has a condition IN cancer or an immune disorder where a NN MD be harmful to the NN ’s NN . And more than a dozen NNS offer philosophical exemptions , sometimes VBN as personal - belief exemptions , which do not require that a parent ’s desire to opt out be specifically about their religious beliefs . Instead , they can include exemptions for conscience or moral ideology . California , West Virginia and Mississippi , which do not allow religious exemptions , RB do not allow philosophical objections . How are religious exemptions connected to the recent US NNS outbreak ? The NNS outbreak in the NNP York suburb of Rockland County has largely been cantered in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community , where there has been some recent resistance to vaccinations . NN rates tend to be low among the ultra-Orthodox , and the reasons vary , from fear of interference from outsiders to confusion over accurate religious and medical NN . The current flare - up in NNP York and NNP Jersey , both of which allow religious exemptions , can be traced RB to the NN outbreaks in Israel last NN . Because ultra-Orthodox parents often send their NNS to their own religious schools , the outbreak was initially largely contained . But it has recently spread significantly . Some Orthodox Jewish schools have been allowing unvaccinated NNS to attend school , against the NNP York NNP Department ’s mandate , during the NN outbreak . How are NNS a religious issue for some NNS ? Some NNS worry that vaccinating interrupts a divine plan for someone ’s NN , and they do not VB to interfere in NNP ’s will . Others have concerns that some NNS MD violate religious dietary laws , unless they are designated kosher or halal . Last NN an influential Islamic group in Indonesia issued a controversial fatwa , which was later overturned , against the NNS - mumps - rubella , or MMR , NN , citing its use of porcine gelatin . And JJ of those who oppose abortion object to certain NNS , IN those designed to prevent chickenpox or hepatitis A . Those NNS are made by growing viruses in fetal embryo fibroblast cells , or cell lines that are grown in laboratories but are derived from CD elective abortions in the 1960s . A Catholic family in Kentucky , for example , has filed a lawsuit against the Northern Kentucky NNP Department for banning unvaccinated students from school and athletics during a chickenpox outbreak at their son ’s Catholic school . Are the recent NNS outbreaks causing some US NNS to reconsider exemptions ? To an extent , yes . NN exemptions for NNS enrolled in kindergarten have slowly grown over the past decade , according to the Centres for NNP NNP and Prevention ( CDC ) , prompting some NNS to consider NNS . California got rid of its non-medical exemptions in 2015 . A few NNS that allow religious exemptions have made them more difficult to VB , requiring things IN a signed affidavit from a religious leader instead of simply filling out an online form . NN lawmakers , often Republicans , around the country introduced more than 150 bills from 2011 through 2017 that MD have made it easier to obtain exemptions from NN policies . But according to a NN in the American Journal of Public NNP published in January , the 13 bills signed into law actually limited the ability to exempt . Some professional organisations have RB taken action . The American Association of Pediatrics has made the elimination of non-medical NN exemptions its top priority this NN , RB ranking it above family separations at the border . Are religious leaders doing anything to address the issue ? Yes . Rabbis and doctors organised a public NN NN to stress the importance of NNS . The Orthodox Union and the Rabbinal Council of America have strongly urged parents to vaccinate their NNS . “ It is well VBN that those facing RB a potential NN - or - death situation are instructed to set aside the Sabbath and other key tenets of halachic ( Jewish law ) observance until the emergency has passed , ” they VBD in November . Elsewhere , local NN and community leaders have stressed open communication between NN officials and religious leaders to bridge cultural divides . In Colorado , Dr Joshua Williams , an assistant professor of pediatrics at the NNP of Colorado Denver School of Medicine , has recommended that the groups talk at specific times , such as when the academic NN begins or at the start of influenza season , and not just during a NN crisis . He is RB working with the NN ’s Council of Churches to hold sessions with parishioners to hear their concerns . “ Religious vaccinations exemptions impact public NN , ” Dr Williams VBD . “ There is a need to dialogue with religious leaders around NN exemptions at local and national levels . ”"

Sinclair explains , “ The effect of the NN was literally to shut down business globally , therefore , shut off the demand for loans , which RB shut off demand for short term money . So , what the public has not seen , is not considering and does not understand is we were stepping into the door of a major financial crisis magnitudes larger than what happened in 2008 and 2009 . It ’s a horrible thing that this NN occurred , but if it had not occurred , we MD have been in a crisis much more serious than 2008 and 2009 . . . . It was blowing sky high . . . . Shutting down demand is all we MD do . It stopped the explosion of interest rates . ” Where do we VB from here ? Sinclair VBZ , “ We are VBG to make a recovery . It ’s not VBG to be a ‘ V ’ by any means . The stock market MD be a ‘ V ’ because the stock market has very little to do with reality . . . . As far as business is concerned , very serious damage has been done to the infrastructure to the business equation . JJ employers are gone . JJ corporations have significant readjustments to be able to build up again . The supply lines and logistics , where did everything come from ? China . . . . This is a major worldwide adjustment , both economically and politically . . . . We had everything made in the cheapest place possible . . . . This is not a passing phenomenon . . . . The only thing that has been steady is gold . . . . The NN that this brings about is a reconstruction of the basic business foundations . It ’s a start over , it ’s not just a slowdown . How JJ restaurants make money on 50 % of the clients ? You can ’t . How JJ automobiles have built up on the lots ? Enormous amounts . How JJ clothing stores shut down full of winter clothes and ca n’t make the shift to summer wear ? You can VB down the entire line . So , this recovery will be more IN an ‘ L ’ . We ’ve come straight down , and we are VBG to VB sideways now . . . . JJ businesses are not VBG to open up again . . . . The idea of the coming inflation as a result of this is simple . Everything that you need will VB up in price . Everything you do n’t need is not VBG to hold value . You are better off with a freezer full of fine cuts of beef than you are with a brand JJ Tesla . The beef will VB up in price , the Tesla will VB down . ” On gold , Sinclair VBZ the ultimate price is an easy - to - calculate math problem . How much gold does America have compared to how much debt it has ? So , how high MD gold ultimately VB ? Sinclair VBZ , “ It ’s simple math . You take the amount of gold the U.S. VBZ it has , and then you take the debt it has , and what price MD you need for the debt to balance to zero ? The price on the low end is $ 50,000 per ounce . The true price is $ 87,500 per ounce . ” Is a biblical debt jubilee coming to America ? Sinclair VBZ , “ We already have jubilees . If you do n’t pay your rent , you have a jubilee . If you do n’t pay your student loan , you have a jubilee . If the payment of your auto insurance is postponed , you have a jubilee . We ’ve got jubilee after jubilee after jubilee . Keep in mind , CD NN ’s jubilee is another NN ’s disaster . It ’s almost as if the Bible is correct in terms of economics . RB , keep in mind , the NNS who are n’t being paid are being hurt very badly . ” Sinclair thinks the recovery will take a decade or longer , and Sinclair VBZ , “ It will be just IN the period between 1929 up to WWII ( 1941 ) . ” Join Greg Hunter as he goes CD - on - CD with renowned gold expert Jim Sinclair .

Since September 2018 , 285 NN NNS have been reported in Brooklyn and Queens , mainly in neighborhoods where ultra-Orthodox Jews have chosen to not have their NNS vaccinated . The Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention , VBD that from Jan. 1 to April 4 , 2019 , 465 individual NNS of NNS have been confirmed in CD NNS . This is the second - highest number of NNS since the CDC declared NNS eliminated in 2000 ; in 2014 , 667 NNS occurred . NNS have still been occurring each NN , often brought into the NNP NNPS from international travelers . Officials VBP that to be the NN of the outbreak in Rockland County , NNP York , where 168 NNS were reported as of April 8 , 2019 . Rockland public NN officials issued a ban that MD keep unvaccinated NNS out of public places , but a judge overruled that on April 5 . On April 9 , county officials VBD they MD appeal . But there are limits to what NN care providers , public NN officials and legislators can do . It is crucial to consider both the power – and the limits – of potential solutions that will provide education , medical care and protection for the public while still upholding principles of informed consent , parental decision - making and sustaining public trust . As a professor who researches and teaches NN law , public NN law and medical ethics , I VBP it ’s worth clarifying what NNS can or cannot legally do when responding to NNS of communicable NN . The law recognizes the NN of an individual to refuse medical interventions . NN law has a strong history of recognizing bodily integrity : Adults can choose whether to accept or reject a proposed medical intervention , RB in instances where public NN authorities conclude a NN MD benefit both the individual and society . The Supreme Court has recognized parents ’ ability to direct the care and NN of their NNS , including consenting or forgoing medical NN for their NN except in very specific circumstances . In the 1905 Jacobson v. Massachusetts case , the Supreme Court upheld a NN law delegating power to local NN officials mandating that adults receive CD smallpox NN in the midst of an epidemic or pay a fine ( about $ 130 today ) . Under the concept of police power , NNS have a duty to enact laws that promote the NN , safety and welfare of its residents . Public NN authorities MD offer NNS as a method of prevention , but medical professionals , public NN authorities and RB courts MD not legally compel a person to submit to a NN . The Jacobson decision RB set forth limits on police power , yet subsequent NNS addressing NN mandates discarded these requirements , extending multiple NN mandates to school attendance for NN not in circulation and in the absence of an epidemic . Deferring to respected scientific consensus as a means to justify forced medical interventions in the name of individual benefit and the public good has historically resulted in some of the most egregious constitutional and JJ rights atrocities in the U.S . The mass forcible sterilization during the eugenics movement is but CD example . The history of NN and medicine further demonstrates the fallibility of commonly accepted medical knowledge , such as when Bayer introduced heroin as a safe , non-addictive substitute for morphine , or physicians prescribed Bendectin and thalidomide to relieve nausea , only to find these medications resulted in babies born with severe birth defects . The law is RB quite clear that public NN authorities and law enforcement MD place restrictions on a person ’s individual liberty – including religious liberty – in situations where a person ’s actions pose a direct , immediate and compelling harm to others , such as using venomous snakes in religious worship or asserting a nonexistent “ NN ” to use an illegal substance such as marijuana when operating a motor vehicle . In public NN law relating to communicable NN , this constitutes a very specific standard : A person must have a present NN , and this person ’s actions must pose a direct threat to others . For example , NN officials MD seek a quarantine order or civil commitment for a person with active tuberculosis who continues to frequent highly populated public spaces until the person is no longer contagious . RB in such a case , NN authorities can offer NN and limit a person ’s movement to prevent infecting others , but the law does not permit forcibly medicating a competent person against his will . Accordingly , legal precedent does not support quarantining vast geographic areas of healthy persons who have not been exposed to the communicable illness , but MD support tailored voluntary isolation and quarantine of persons who have been exposed to , or currently have , the illness . What NN officials can do to protect NNS The CDC classifies NNS as CD of the top 10 public NN achievements . The vast majority ( about 98 % ) of parents across the U.S. as a whole comply with the NN law mandated schedule of NNS for their NNS . NNS , IN any other FDA - approved product such as a prescription drug or medical device , carry a set of risks and benefits . These calculations vary depending on the NN , its efficacy , safety , potential side effects , the severity of the illness the NN aims to protect against , and the individual to whom it is administered . NN NN and practice similarly evolved with historical mistakes ( the Cutter incident ) and ongoing disputes about risks and benefits for individual NNS IN NN and anthrax . To promote NN for NNS , NN officials MD offer educational campaigns and set up free clinics for parents to bring their NNS . NN laws MD RB mandate NNS as a condition for school attendance , or require excluding unvaccinated NNS during an active outbreak at their school . However , if NNS offer a religious or nonmedical exemption , courts have been clear that NN officials and school officials do not have discretion to require the NN ’s parent to identify with an organized religion or reject the sincerity of the parent ’s beliefs because this violates the NNP Amendment . Public NN professionals worry that parents who forgo NN are placing their NN and the community at NN . Some have advocated that the NN should step in with coercive measures such as eliminating any nonmedical exemptions for all NNS or intervene by force , such as classifying parents ’ decision as NN neglect or seeking a court order to vaccinate the NN . In my opinion , these strategies rely on a distortion of legal precedent , dismiss longstanding authority of parents to make decisions for their NNS , and threaten to undermine an already fractured public trust . NNS that uphold NN intervention to protect a NN by compelling medical NN generally require that the NN has an illness , the illness is severe and NN - threatening , and the risks and benefits of intervening are assessed . This requires medical professionals and NN officials to maintain precision in distinguishing whether the parents are deciding to forgo recommended NNS , or whether they are refusing medical care for a critically ill NN . Indeed , a recent case in Chandler , Arizona , demonstrated how a NN of coercion and force MD result in parental fear and refusal to constructively engage with NN officials for RB an ill NN . NN public NN officials have the duty to protect residents from illness and communicable NN , but these strategies must fall within appropriate legal parameters . Dismissing these legal boundaries or justifying unnecessary force not only undermines fundamental liberties , but in my view fuels parental and community distrust of NN officials and sets RB the ultimate goals of protecting the public ."

In 1998 , a NN by a British NN Andrew Wakefield incorrectly linked the MMR ( NNP , mumps and rubella ) NN to NN . His NN has since been completely discredited and Mr Wakefield has been struck off - but the NN has endured within the JJ anti-vaccination community . • ' Do n't be taken in by JJ NN NN myths ' All four doctors at Tuesday 's hearing echoed that there was "" absolutely no evidence "" that exists which supports the link . This is RB affirmed in JJ Danish NN released on Tuesday . The NN examined 650,000 NNS over 10 NNS and categorically concludes that MMR does not increase the NN of NN or trigger it in those susceptible . Mr Lindenbenger , doctors and members of Congress at the hearing all pointed out the internet fuels the spread of misinformation . "" My mother MD turn to anti-vax groups online and JJ NN rather than NN officials and critical sources , "" the teenager VBD the hearing . He RB pointed out his mother 's decision had come from concern , not malice . "" There 's a lot of emotional appeals talking about families , NNS and appealing to a parent 's love , and manipulating that to convince them NNS are dangerous , "" he VBD the hearing about the nature of online posts . "" That 's the issue I take . I have tried to convey to my parents I do n't VB they are stupid for believing that , but NNS are very convincing and that 's very dangerous . "" Mr Lindenberger 's NN went viral in late 2018 when he asked online forum Reddit about the subject . At CD point during Tuesday 's hearing , Republican Senator Johnny Isakson joked that he MD "" love "" to be a guest at the Linderberger family home for Thanksgiving dinner . "" MD be a heck of a discussion everybody MD have , "" he VBD about the family 's public disagreement . NN experts have RB warned about the NN posed by parents who do not vaccinate . They say the decision affects not only their families but everyone else because high NN rates are integral to keep communities protected . This concept , which is VBN as herd immunity , offers protection for NNS IN newborns and NNS with auto - immune diseases who are not able to be vaccinated . The US has been battling a number of outbreaks of preventable diseases in recent NNS . Senator Patty Murray , from Washington NN , spoke at the hearing about a recent NNS outbreak in her local Clark County where 70 NNS have been confirmed . Less than 80 % of nursery - age NNS were immunised there in 2017 - well below the target rate of about 95 % for herd immunity . At Tuesday 's hearing , doctors implored the federal NN to increase funding for NN education . They RB asked NN lawmakers to increase limits on non-medical NN exemptions for parents . California is CD NN that has already cracked down on exemptions , following an outbreak of NNS linked to Disneyland in 2015 . Similar outbreaks are not isolated to the US - there have been increases recorded elsewhere around the NN . In 2018 , Europe saw three times more NNS case than the NN before . The NNP NNP Organisation ( WHO ) have blamed growing NN hesitancy for the outbreaks . "" Industrialised NNS must not be complacent and forget that the NN can come RB IN a storm , "" WHO 's Dr Martin Friede VBD the BBC after the data was released ."

The researchers VBD that directing NNS 's attention to the risks posed by not getting vaccinated by showing them the pictures of sick NNS and having them read a mom's written account of her NN 's NN changed their attitudes , leading them to VB more positively about vaccinations , NN author Zachary Horne , a graduate student at the NNP of Illinois , VBD in a statement . That was true for RB "" the most skeptical participants in the NN , "" Horne VBD . There were 644 NNS of NNS in the NNP NNPS in 2014 , according to the NN . That 's triple the number seen in 2013 . And RB in 2000 , researchers thought that this NN had been eliminated from the U.S. , according to the NN . [ 5 Dangerous NN Myths ] "" The re-emergence of NNS has been linked to an increase in the number of parents refusing to vaccinate their NNS , "" the researchers wrote in their NN . CD reason that parents do n't vaccinate their NNS is the mistaken belief that the NN that protects against NNS , mumps and rubella ( the MMR NN ) is linked with an increased NN of NN . Researchers have been looking for effective ways to convince NNS who hold this mistaken belief about the benefits of vaccinations . In the JJ NN , the researchers asked 315 NNS questions to examine their views on several potentially controversial subjects , including their attitudes toward NNS and their willingness to vaccinate their kids . Then , the NNS in the NN were assigned to CD of three groups . NNS in the JJ group looked at NN - based materials that challenged the anti-vaccination point of view . NNS in the second group read a paragraph written by a mother describing her NN 's infection with NNS , and RB looked at pictures of NNS with NNS , mumps or rubella . They RB read three warnings about why it is important to vaccinate kids . NNS in the third group , which was a comparison group , were asked to read about a subject not related to NNS . Then , the researchers again evaluated the NNS 's views on NN and their intentions to vaccinate their NNS in the future . The investigators VBD that the intervention that involved showing NNS the consequences of the diseases was the NN that had the biggest effect on the NNS who were initially the most skeptical about vaccinations , Horne VBD . In contrast , showing NNS the scientific evidence that there is no link between NNS and NN did not VB the NNS 's views on NN , the researchers VBD . The reason this type of intervention does n't work is likely that trying to convince someone that his or her beliefs are false is not the best argumentative strategy , Horne VBD . The NN shows that "" instead of VBG up against the belief about the link between NNS and NN , "" researchers should aim to convince NNS that , independent of whether they VBP in that link , they should RB VB that there are serious consequences of not getting NNS vaccinated , Horne VBD Live NNP . "" The insight [ from the NN ] was to direct their attention towards those consequences , rather than trying to combat their false beliefs that there is some link where there is not , "" Horne VBD .

Though I have been actively involved over the past decade in promoting the MMR NN in face of claims of a link with NN , I hope British immunisation authorities will continue to resists calls for compulsion . As the father of a NN with NN who was RB as a GP administering vaccinations to babies , I read with great interest Andrew Wakefield ’s now notorious 1998 NN in the The Lancet suggesting a link between MMR and NN . It was immediately obvious that though this paper presented no evidence for this link , it MD VB undue alarm among parents of NNS with NN as well as among parents of NNS due for vaccinations . In response I wrote the JJ of a series of articles , culminating in 2004 in a book MMR and NN : What Parents Need To VB . This book sought to reassure parents that they had no grounds to fear that MMR had caused their NNS ’s NN , and that it offered effective protection against serious diseases .

( NNP of Maryland School of Medicine via AP ) NNP of Maryland School of Medicine / AP Photo Only about half of Americans say they MD VB a NN - CD NN if the NNS working furiously to create CD succeed , according to a JJ poll from . That ’s surprisingly low considering the effort VBG into the against the NN that has sparked a NN since RB emerging from China late last NN . But more NNS might eventually roll up their sleeves : The poll , released Wednesday , VBD 31 % simply were n’t sure if they ’d VB vaccinated . Another 1 in 5 VBD they ’d refuse . NN experts already worry about the whiplash if NN promises IN NNP Donald NNP ’s goal of a 300 million - dose stockpile by January fail . Only NN and NN will tell -- and the JJ poll shows the public is indeed skeptical . “ It ’s always better to under - promise and over - deliver , ” VBD Dr. William Schaffner , an infectious NN specialist at Vanderbilt NNP Medical Center . “ The unexpected looms JJ and that ’s why I VBP for any of these NNS , we ’re VBG to need a JJ safety database to provide the reassurance , ” he added . Among Americans who say they MD n’t VB vaccinated , 7 in 10 worry about safety . “ I am not an anti-vaxxer , ” VBD Melanie Dries , 56 , of Colorado Springs , Colorado . But , “ to VB a NN - CD NN within a NN or CD ... causes me to fear that it wo n’t be widely tested as to side effects . ” Dr. Francis Collins , who directs the National Institutes of NNP , insists safety is the top priority . The NIH is creating a master plan for testing the leading NNP - CD NN candidates in tens of thousands of NNS , to prove if they really work and RB if they 're safe . “ I MD not VB NNS to VB that we ’re cutting corners because that MD be a big mistake . I VBP this is an effort to try to achieve efficiencies , but not to sacrifice rigor , ” Collins VBD the AP earlier this month . “ Definitely the worst thing that MD happen is if we rush through a NN that turns out to have significant side effects , ” Collins added . Among those who VBP a NN , the AP - NORC poll VBD protecting themselves , their family and the community are the top reasons . "" I ’m definitely VBG to VB it , ” VBD Brandon Grimes , 35 , of Austin , Texas . “ As a father who takes care of his family , I VBP ... it ’s important for me to VB vaccinated as soon as it ’s available to better protect my family . ” And about 7 in 10 of those who MD VB vaccinated say NN wo n't VB RB to normal without a NN . A site foreman for his family ’s construction business , Grimes travels from house to house interacting with different crews , and VBD some of his coworkers RB are looking forward to NN to minimize on - the - job NN . The JJ NN is most dangerous to older adults and NNS of any age who have chronic NN problems such as diabetes or heart NN . The poll VBD 67 % of NNS 60 and older say they ’d VB vaccinated , compared with 40 % who are younger . And death counts suggest black and Hispanic Americans are more vulnerable to NN - CD , because of unequal access to NN care and other factors . Yet the poll VBD just 25 % of African Americans and 37 % of Hispanics MD VB a NN compared to 56 % of whites . Among NNS who do n't VB a NN , about 4 in 10 say they 're concerned about catching NN - CD from the shot . But most of the leading NN candidates do n't contain the NN itself , meaning they can't VB infection . And 3 in 10 who do n't VB a NN do n't fear getting seriously ill from the NN . Over 5.5 million NNS worldwide have been confirmed infected by the NN , and more than 340,000 deaths have been recorded , including nearly 100,000 in the U.S. , according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins NNP . Experts VBP the true toll is significantly higher . And while most NNS who VBP NNP - CD have mild NNS and recover , doctors still are discovering the NN attacks in far sneakier ways than just causing pneumonia — from NN clots to heart and kidney damage to the latest scare , a NN - threatening inflammatory reaction in NNS . Whatever the final statistics show about how often it kills , NN specialists agree the JJ NN appears deadlier than the typical NN . Yet the survey suggests a NN MD be no more popular than the yearly NN shot . Worldwide , are in early stages of testing or poised to begin . British researchers are opening CD of the biggest studies so far , to test an Oxford NNP - created shot in 10,000 NNS . For all the promises of the NNP administration ’s “ , ” only 20 % of Americans expect any NN to be available to the public by NN ’s end , the poll VBD . Most VBP sometime next NN is more likely . Political divisions seen over how the country reopens the economy are reflected in desire for a NN , too . More than half of Democrats call a NN necessary for reopening , compared to about a third of Republicans . While 62 % of Democrats MD VB the NN , only 43 % of Republicans say the same . “ There 's still a JJ amount of uncertainty around taking the NN , ” VBD Caitlin Oppenheimer , who leads NORC 's public NN NN . “ There is a lot of opportunity to communicate with Americans about the value and the safety of a NN . ” The AP - NORC poll of 1,056 adults was conducted NNP 14 - 18 using a sample drawn from NORC ’s probability - based AmeriSpeak Panel , which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population . The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points ."

But in a NN gripped by NN , JJ donors have put aside such concerns and are writing JJ cheques in the hope of contributing to the end of the NN . Alibaba founder Jack Ma has promised more than $ 14 m for NN NN , while the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged up to $ 100 m to the JJ response to NNP - CD , including funding to accelerate the development of NNS . RB the Gates Foundation ’s move pales in comparison with the funds now being committed by governments and pharmaceutical NNS . In the US alone , the National Institutes of NNP , the federal NN centres , have secured $ 1.8bn in additional NN funding for NNP - CD work , including NN investigations . Meanwhile the American drugs group Johnson & Johnson is putting $ 1bn into developing a specific NN NN , in a project jointly funded by the US NN . But charitable dollars can still play a crucial role . Philanthropy advisors say donors are free from the burdens of politics that often hamper policymakers and from the profits drive that influences NNS ( RB if , as with J&J ’s NNP - CD NN , executives claim a particular move is profit - free ) . This can allow philanthropists to VB very JJ term NN and bring together disparate groups of partners , including universities , NN laboratories and other donors . “ We can fund longer timelines than NN or industry , ” VBZ Heather Youngs , programme officer for scientific NN at Open Philanthropy , a NN and grant - making organisation . “ They have constraints because of the stakeholder groups they have to answer to , whether voters or shareholders . So philanthropy can fill in the gaps . ” An example is Open Philanthropy , where the main funders are Cari Tuna and her husband and NNP co-founder Dustin Moskovitz . The foundation makes grants to NN NN centres globally , such as a 2017 award of more than $ 11 m to support NN at the NNP of Washington ’s Institute for Protein Design for the development a universal influenza NN . Philanthropy is particularly important in NN development because drug NNS find it hard to achieve a financial return on the JJ , JJ - term investments needed . “ You VBP these glaring market failures , JJ of them in the NN NN , ” VBZ Mark Suzman , chief executive of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , which since inception has committed more than $ 18bn to the discovery , development and delivery of NNS . Suzman cites malaria , which despite being responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths a NN , still has no effective NN . “ We do n’t have malaria problems in rich NNS because we have effective prophylaxis : if you visit a malarial zone , you can take pills and you wo n’t VB the NN , ” he VBZ . “ So there is n’t an incentive for the private sector to put in the billions of dollars that are needed to underwrite a JJ NN . ” And while JJ pharmaceutical groups were successful in developing an Ebola NN , the market — limited largely to a few African NNS — was not JJ enough for them to recover their costs . “ In the end they are businesses , and some of them got quite burnt by that , ” VBZ Suzman . When NNS do invest , it tends to be in the later stages of NN development , VBZ Melissa Stevens , executive director of the Milken Institute Center for Strategic Philanthropy , which advises families , foundations and individual philanthropists . Charitable dollars can play a critical role in closing the gap between the original NN project and delivering a NN to the public , perhaps 10 - 15 NNS later . Donors fund the earlier , riskier stages in the journey of NNS from academia , NN labs and entrepreneurial biotech firms to pre-clinical trials and ensuring they meet the regulatory standards needed to enter clinical trials . “ That ’s where philanthropy can have an outsized impact , ” VBZ Stevens . British philanthropist Richard Ross agrees . He chairs Rosetrees Trust , a fund specialising in medical NN established by his late entrepreneur parents , which has distributed nearly £ 50 m since its foundation in 1987 . “ A lot of [ early NN ] is basic NN , which can be 30 NNS away from practical application in medicine , ” he VBZ . “ NNS come and say I ca n’t VB grant money because I have no data . We can make a difference with CD NN ’s money or three NNS ’ money . That ’s an entrepreneurial approach . ” Rosetrees , which has set aside money for NNP - CD NN , is considering about 10 projects , including CD involving a drug used for brain tumours and another an existing tuberculosis NN . Philanthropists can RB fund NN - linked education . “ You VBP a growing anti-vaccination movement based in ignorance , ” VBZ Amir Pasic , dean of Indiana NNP ’s Lilly Family School of Philanthropy . “ You ca n’t overestimate the importance of education , and I VBP we ’ll VB more of that . ” While philanthropists financed NN NN RB before NNP - CD came along , the NN has sparked a wave of interest among potential JJ donors . Eric Kessler , founder , principal and senior managing director at Arabella Advisors , a US - based philanthropic consultancy , VBZ : “ Donors who have historically focused on JJ NN are tripling down RB now , and JJ donors who ’ve never focused on JJ NN are getting into the fray for the JJ NN . It ’s hard to VB how much is VBG specifically into NN NN , but we can say it ’s significant . ” Kasey Oliver , a director in the consulting practice at philanthropic advisory NN Geneva NNP , VBZ that as well as reacting to an event such as the NNP - CD NN , donors can be motivated by anything from wanting to VB eradicate a NN that has killed a family member to wishing to bet on something that MD bring JJ - term NN . However , participating in NN NN as a philanthropist is not easy . RB , it involves complex and emerging NN and so means relying on experts . “ You need to be willing and able to be flexible and a little hands - off , ” VBZ Stevens . “ And not everyone goes into their philanthropy with that type of mindset . ” And because it requires the involvement of the private sector , particularly in manufacturing and distribution , donors MD face obstacles in ensuring that any successful NN can be sold cheaply enough to benefit poor communities . To address this , in 2003 the Gates Foundation developed its JJ Access model for grant contracts . This stipulates that NNS or universities that receive its funding must make the resulting treatments widely available at affordable prices . They are RB required to share data . Another challenge for individual philanthropists without the resources of billionaire donors is the sheer amount of money required for NN development . This was among the reasons behind a JJ collaborative fund , which was launched in January to accelerate the development of NNS against emerging diseases . With an initial investment of $ 460 m from the German , Japanese and Norwegian governments , the Gates Foundation and the UK ’s Wellcome Trust , the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations acts as a hub to which any philanthropist can contribute . The group has issued an urgent call for $ 2bn to develop a NNP - CD NN . Another NN for a philanthropist with less money than Gates to VB is to create a prize to stimulate academic competition . American philanthropists Gary and Alya Michelson have done just that through the Michelson Prizes . Their annual awards VBP to young NNS — each winner receiving $ 150,000 — who are working in JJ ways on JJ immunology , NN discovery , and immunotherapy NN in major JJ diseases . At least with prizes , the donors ’ names can be recognised . Otherwise , unlike with gifts to an opera house or NN building , or RB the endowment of an academic post or a scholarship , it is hard to attach a donor ’s name to JJ - term medical NN . “ Does this appeal to NNS who VBP their name on the wall ? No , ” VBZ Ross . Moreover , with NN projects , as with most JJ term medical NN , there is the likelihood of failure . Few donors VBP to fund a loser . But developing NNS , from the pre-clinical phase to production , typically takes more than a decade and has just a 6 per cent probability of making it to market , according to a 2013 NN led by researchers at Erasmus NNP in the Netherlands . “ The trouble with NNS is they ’re expensive , ” VBZ Peter Hotez , co-director of the Center for NNP Development at Texas NNP ’s Hospital . “ You need substantial funding and the timelines are pretty JJ — and often donors , especially the more entrepreneurial donors , VBP a more immediate return . That ’s the toughest part of this . ” But Maria Elena Bottazzi , Hotez ’s co-director , argues that RB when it results in failure , funding NN NN is extremely valuable . “ It ’s transformative , because you are at the same NN building the next generation of innovators and NNS , ” she VBZ . And , as the NN NN has demonstrated , success can have a JJ and JJ impact that is JJ . “ Where MD we be RB now if we had a NN for NNP - CD ? ” VBZ Oliver . “ NNS are game changers . They reshape the NN — imagine if that was part of your philanthropic legacy . ”"

The findings bolster the argument that a mercury - based NN preservative does n't VB NN in NNS , although it 's unclear from the NN whether some mercury MD linger elsewhere in the NN . The NN addresses an unanswered question about the safety of thimerosal , a preservative that has been eliminated from routine U.S. NNS , and breaks down as ethyl mercury in the NN . It is still used in other NNS , including Argentina . NNS assumed the NN risks from ethyl mercury were similar to methyl mercury from eating fish . And in 1999 , the federal NN and NN manufacturers agreed that thimerosal should be reduced or eliminated in NNS to lower exposure to mercury from all sources . The decision was based on what was VBN about methyl mercury exposure . The JJ findings suggest that methyl mercury and ethyl mercury are very different and that the removal of thimerosal from NNS MD have been over - cautious . "" The NN supports the decision by the NNP NNP Organization to continue to permit thimerosal to remain in NNS for the NN 's NNS , "" VBD NN co-author Dr. Michael Pichichero of the NNP of Rochester in Rochester , N.Y . He VBD thimerosal NNS are cheaper to produce and therefore more accessible to much of the NN . In the U.S. - funded NN , NN samples were taken from 216 healthy babies before and after they got NNS containing the preservative thimerosal . NN levels of mercury were highest shortly after the babies were vaccinated and fell to pre-vaccination levels within a few weeks . "" The amount VBN in the NN was about CD - tenth of that predicted in that the late 1990s and the length of NN it stays in the NN is CD - tenth of that predicted , "" Pichichero VBD . Mercury levels RB were measured in the babies ' stools and urine . In the stool samples , the levels were highest after NN and RB fell , but more slowly than NN levels . There was no significant amount of mercury in the urine . The authors MD not determine what happened to all the mercury after it left the NN . All the infants gave samples twice : before NN and at CD other NN , ranging from 12 hours later to 30 days . The NN will be published in the February issue of the journal Pediatrics . The medical journal released the findings early because of a controversy surrounding a JJ TV series premiering Thursday , which features a lawyer who argues in court that a NN NN made a NN autistic . The journal is published by the American Academy of Pediatrics , which on Monday called on ABC to cancel the JJ episode of the series , "" Eli Stone , "" saying that it perpetuates the myth that NNS can VB NN . NN is a complex disorder featuring repetitive behaviors and poor JJ interaction and communication skills . NNS generally VBP that genetics plays a role in causing the disorder ; a NN that thimerosal is to blame has been repeatedly discounted in scientific studies . Pichichero VBD he has received NN grants and served as a consultant to several NN makers , but VBD there was no industry involvement in the JJ NN . He is an unpaid consultant to the WHO on NNS ."

The NN examined 59 infants who were at high NN of developing NN ; that is , each had an older sibling with NN . The artificial intelligence predicted with 100 percent accuracy that 48 infants MD not develop NN . In addition , of the 11 infants who did develop the disorder by the NN they were 2 NNS old , the system correctly predicted nine of the NNS . "" It was extremely accurate , "" Robert Emerson , the lead author on the NN and a former cognitive neuroscience postdoctoral fellow at the NNP of North Carolina ( UNC ) , VBD Live NNP . [ 5 Things That MD VB NN ] Studies show that 20 percent of babies who have older siblings with NN will develop the disorder ; among babies in the general population , 1.5 percent develop NN , Emerson VBD Live NNP . The results of the JJ NN MD lead to JJ diagnostic tools that identify NN before NNS occur , giving clinicians the opportunity to intervene early , the researchers VBD . "" The idea is that we can be more effective if we can VB to these kids before they develop NN , perhaps ameliorating or preventing it , "" Dr. Joseph Piven , a professor of psychiatry at the UNC School of Medicine and director of the Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities , VBD Live NNP . The researchers published their results today ( June 7 ) in the journal NNP Translational Medicine . NN spectrum disorder , a brain - based disorder characterized by a wide range of JJ - communication challenges and repetitive behaviors , affects about CD out of every 68 NNS in the NNP NNPS . Behavioral NNS typically begin to appear in NNS at around age 2 . Emerson and his colleagues demonstrated that they MD identify biomarkers for the disorder before the NNS occur . As part of their NN , the researchers used MRI scanners to image the brains of the infants while they slept . During the scans , the researchers recorded the neural activity of 230 different regions in the brain , looking particularly at whether or not pairs of these region — referred to as functional connections — were synchronized with each other , and if so , to what extent . In total , the researchers measured 26,335 functional connections crucial for cognition , memory and behavior . When the NNS reached age 2 , they came RB in for a behavior assessment . The researchers looked at the NNS 's JJ interactions , communication , motor development and tendency to perform repetitive actions , and determined whether each NN had NN . [ 11 Facts Every Parent Should VB About Their Baby's Brain ] With all of the data in hand , the researchers set out to RB train their machine learning program , and then use it to run predictions . They wanted to VB how accurately it MD predict which infants had developed NN , using only the functional connections data from when the NNS were 6 months old . In other words , although the researchers knew which babies had developed into toddlers with NN and which had not , the machine learning program did not . Machine learning is a kind of artificial intelligence system that gets smarter based on the data it processes . In this case , the program was learning to spot differences between the functional connections imaged in the MRI data collected at 6 months old that correlate with cognition , memory and behavior and the details from the behavioral assessments collected at 24 months . As the program did this , it separated the NNS into CD groups — those with NN and those without the condition . Once it was trained , it MD make predictions . [ 7 Baby Myths Debunked ] But during the training process , the researchers did n't use the data from all 59 kids . Instead , they fed data in from 58 of the 59 infants to train the model , and then to VB the prediction , they inputed the data from the CD infant they had left out . They repeated this for all 59 NNS . "" Each NN was predicted separately based on a model from the other NNS in the group , "" Emerson VBD . In the end , the machine learning program was correct in 82 percent of the NNS in which the NNS did develop NN . Piven VBD the team published a NN earlier in the NN that RB showed an impressive prediction rate , but that NN required CD MRI scans , CD at 6 months of age and CD at 1 NN . Moving the needle to an earlier age is a big advance , Piven VBD . The NN team was amazed by the parents who participated in this and other studies over the NNS , given all that was required , he VBD . "" This is an extraordinary group of NNS , "" Piven VBD . "" Not only do they have an older NN with NN , but they bring their babies , often multiple times and from very far away , to CD of our four clinical sites around the country . "" The researchers VBD they hope their contributions will lead to more effective interventions for NNS on the brink of developing NN ."

Three JJ coronaviruses have emerged since the turn of the century . All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the NN of publication . Some NN MD be out of date . Visit our NN hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent NN on the NN - CD outbreak . Coronaviruses are a JJ family of enveloped RNA viruses that mostly infect birds and mammals . In humans , they can VB mild infection in the upper respiratory tract , IN the common cold , but RB more serious lower respiratory tract infections . These infections can manifest as bronchitis , pneumonia , or a severe respiratory illness , such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( NN ) , Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) , or NN NN CD ( NNP - CD ) . But how similar are the NN , MERS , and NN - CD coronaviruses ? And how do the diseases compare ? In this feature , we explore the history of each NN outbreak , as well as the statistics and medical advances . Stay informed with live updates on the current NN - CD outbreak and visit our NN hub for more advice on prevention and NN . The NN that causes NNP is called NNP - CoV . According to the NNP NNP Organization ( WHO ) , the JJ cluster of NNP NNS occurred in China ’s Guangdong province in November 2002 . NN has identified horseshoe bats as the natural reservoir of NNP - CoV . Civets and animals in wet markets RB likely contributed to the NN crossing from animals into humans . The organization was RB notified , of more than 100 deaths due to a JJ infectious NN , on February 10 , 2003 . The next day , the Chinese NN ministry made an official report of 300 NNS and five deaths due to an acute respiratory syndrome . On March 12 , 2003 , the WHO issued a JJ alert , warning of atypical pneumonia spreading among hospital staff . A mere 3 days later , the WHO coined the name NNP and put out an emergency travel advisory , asking travelers to be familiar with the NNS of the condition . They RB proposed that the NN was spreading throughout the NN by NNS using air transport . Later in March , the WHO recommended that airports in areas with NNS of NNP screen passengers . From April of that NN onward , the WHO issued a number of warnings , asking NNS to postpone all but essential travel to affected areas . These areas included , at various times , Hong Kong , Toronto , several areas of mainland China , and Taiwan . A paper published NNP 15 , 2003 in The NNP England Journal of Medicine identified a JJ NN as the underlying pathogen . The WHO officially declared the NNP epidemic to be contained on July 5 of that NN . Since then , there have been four small outbreaks of NNP . Of these , three involved NNS who worked with the NNP NN in laboratory settings and acquired the NN accidentally . The fourth incidence has been mostly attributed to infection from an animal source . There have been no reported NNS of NNP since then , although the WHO warn that “ These events demonstrate that the resurgence of NNP leading to an outbreak remains a distinct possibility and does not allow for complacency . ” • Total number of NNS : 8,439 , 21 % of which developed in healthcare workers • Number of NNS in the NNP NNPS : 73 • Mode of transmission : Droplets produced by coughing , sneezing , talking , or breathing • Key NNS : A cough ( dry at JJ ) , a fever , and diarrhea in the JJ or second week of illness , or both MERS occurs as a result of infection with the NN MERS - CoV . On September 20 , 2012 , the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases reported a novel NN isolated from sputum samples of a 60 - NN - old NN from Saudi Arabia , who had died 3 months earlier . Within the next month , the number of confirmed MERS NNS rose to nine , with five fatalities . The earliest case dated RB to April 2012 . Across the globe , 27 NNS have reported NNS of MERS since 2012 , but around 80 % of NNS have occurred in Saudi Arabia . MERS - CoV is a zoonotic NN , meaning that most NNS of infection pass from animals to humans . According to the WHO , direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels is the most common route of infection . Transmission among NNS is rare , and it mostly occurs among family members or in healthcare settings . The MERS - CoV NN has similarities to European bat coronaviruses . • Number of NNS in the U.S. : 2 • Mode of transmission : Droplets from person to person , unclear from camels to humans • At NN groups : Men above the age of 60 , particularly those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes , high NN pressure , and kidney failure The NN NNP - CoV - 2 is the pathogen that causes NN - CD . The NN has a close resemblance to NNP - CoV . The JJ NNS of NN - CD were reported in Wuhan , China , in December 2019 . On January 5 , 2020 , the WHO published the JJ NN of an outbreak of unknown NN . By the end of January , the organization had declared NNP - CD to be a public NN emergency of international concern . The name NNP - CD was officially coined , by the WHO , on February 11 . Exactly 1 month later , the organization declared a NN . To date , NNS of NN - CD have been reported on every continent except Antarctica . Governments across the NN have responded with varying degrees of JJ distancing measures in a bid to curb the spread of the NN . As the numbers of infections and deaths from NN - CD continue to rise , researchers are working to identify suitable treatments and NNS to curb the NN . • Number of NNS in the U.S. : 432,438 • Mode of transmission : Droplets produced by coughing , sneezing , or talking , limited evidence of other routes • At NN groups : Adults aged 65 and over , and NNS of all ages with underlying medical conditions • NN : No specific NN , although several candidate drugs are undergoing testing • NN : No NN , although several candidate NNS are in development Each of the three JJ coronaviruses that has emerged since the turn of the century has caused respiratory NN outbreaks , but each has RB displayed unique features . NNP and MERS have significantly higher case fatality rates than NNP - CD . Yet NNP - CD is more infectious — the underlying NN - CoV - 2 NN spreads more easily among NNS , leading to greater case numbers . Despite the lower case fatality rate , the overall number of deaths from NN - CD far outweighs that from NN or MERS . There have been no NNS of NNP for over a decade . But MERS is an ongoing public NN concern . CD factor that MD contribute to the extent of damage that any JJ NN can VB is globalization . As infectious NN specialist and WHO advisor Prof. David Heymann VBD Medical NNP Today in an interview : “ In the past , coronaviruses that VBP the common cold in humans RB emerged , possibly in the same NN as did the current NN . ” “ But they did not have the opportunity to hop on international flights and spread rapidly around the globe , ” he continued . “ They likely circulated locally and then gradually spread to neighboring NNS and onward throughout the NN . ” For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel NN and NN - CD , click here ."

But the NN is unlikely to end the increasingly charged debate about NN safety . The NN examined whether thimerosal — a mercury - containing NN preservative that was almost entirely eliminated from childhood NNS by 2002 — is associated with neurological or certain psychological problems in NNS ages 7 to 10 . Some parents ’ groups and prominent legislators contend that thimerosal has caused an epidemic of childhood NN . Several studies have examined this question and VBD no evidence that thimerosal is associated with NN . The most recent NN did not assess thimerosal ’s association with NN directly . The Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention is conducting a separate NN and thimerosal NN that is expected to be published next NN .

(_-LRB- The_DT Guardian_NNP )_-RRB-","Thursday ’s NNP Malaria Day arrived with some good NN stories : the JJ - scale launch of a pioneering NN in Malawi is just CD promising fresh approach to tackling the NN . Others include the introduction of better bednets , insecticides and diagnostics , JJ drugs to respond to the continuing threat of resistance and the potential through “ gene - drive ” technology to wipe out the mosquito that transmits the parasite between humans . There has been some progress towards ending the NN among the 21 NNS targeted for its elimination by next NN . Yet the trend is less impressive in some of the highest burden NNS such as Nigeria and there is backsliding elsewhere , notably in Venezuela , where NN failures are undermining the NN system and imposing a heavy JJ burden . Much work still needs to be done to improve the data on malaria ’s impact , notably to VB NNS focus their resources . But it is clear that JJ progress has stagnated , with around 200 m annual NNS and at least 430,000 deaths imposing a heavy JJ and financial toll . There is limited potential or appetite for private sector funding mechanisms and in the build - up to “ replenishment ” fundraisings for international funding agencies this NN , the monies invested remain far below the levels estimated to be necessary to tackle the NN .

I became minister of NN in 2016 and when I finished I wanted to VB RB into public NN and VB tackle a NN with a JJ dimension . What are your priorities at RBM ? We are at a critical phase in the fight against malaria . With the JJ Fund to Fight Aids , TB and Malaria replenishment this NN , we will step up the fight . My priority is to really call on all governments to play their part . To make the biggest difference , we need to VB the highest malaria - burden NNS VBP RB on track through four key responses : political will , strategic data to drive impact , better guidance on up - to - date scientifically proven approaches , and a co-ordinated response . What is the likelihood of ending malaria ? We VBP it is possible to end malaria within our lifetime . But there has to be a JJ collective effort from all angles with all stakeholders to make it happen . Our theme is “ malaria starts with me ” . We are calling on pretty much everyone to contribute : political leaders to maintain their commitment to funding ; the private sector ; and the citizens of every country to play their part themselves , by teaching others and holding their political leaders accountable .

The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail RB reported that researchers have VBN no evidence to support the ’ leaky gut NN ’ . They say that this NN proposes that NNS such as MMR damage the intestine causing digestive problems , leading to the production of peptides “ which can damage the brain and possibly VB NN ” . This well conducted NN used reliable analysis techniques to compare autistic NNS across a broad range of intelligences to age - matched NN NNS . Despite the newspaper headlines and coverage , the NN did not look at the effects of the MMR jab and NN . Instead , it tested and compared the urine of autistic boys with the urine of boys without NN . The researchers conclude that there were no differences between the levels of peptides in the groups and say they have effectively disproved the ’ leaky gut NN ‘ . However , further NN is needed to establish whether a casein and gluten - free diet has other effects on NN . The researchers call for more studies into special diet as a NN for NN , but they do not suggest that their NN has any implication for the discredited MMR NN / NN NN . Where did the NN come from ? Dr Hilary Cass from the Great Ormond Street Hospital for NNPS and colleagues from around England and Scotland carried out the NN . The authors acknowledge the support of the NN and development fund of the Royal Hospital for Sick NNPS in Edinburgh and the Chief Scientist Office in Scotland . Competing interests were declared . The NN was published in Archives of NNP in Childhood , a peer - reviewed medical journal . What kind of scientific NN was this ? This was a case NN NN that compared 65 boys with NN , aged between five and 11 NNS , with 158 NN boys of a similar age . The researchers say that , for a number of NNS , it has been thought that the urine of NNS with NN contains opioid peptides that originate from outside the NN . Opioid peptides are chemical compounds that are so called because they resemble morphine . They can be produced by the NN and through the digestion of foods such as grain and milk . Grains such as wheat , rye , barley and oats contain the protein gluten , that produces opioid peptides in the gut , while milk produces another variety , casein . CD NN for the development of NN is the ’ leaky gut NN ‘ : the idea that NNS with NN become sensitive to gluten . The gluten is thought to inflame the small bowel . The resulting damage allows opioid peptides from food to be absorbed into the NN and then enter the urine . Before the opioid peptides in the NN are excreted they are assumed to cross into the brain and result in the NNS of NN . Previous NN has proposed that excluding casein and gluten ( milk and grains ) from the diet might VB NNS with NN by reducing the amount of circulating opioid peptides . The NN proposes that opioid peptides VBN in urine reflect a disturbance in the integrity of the gut epithelium ( i.e. a leaky gut ) . Proponents of the NN hope that the peptides can act as a diagnostic marker for NN and predict that a diet excluding gluten and casein MD VB to treat NNS with autistic NNS . This NN aimed to determine the occurrence of the peptides in the urine of NNS who have NN and those who do not . The researchers recruited 65 boys from CD hospitals specialising in autistic spectrum disorders in London . For the NN group , 202 non-autistic boys of similar age were recruited from mainstream infant and primary schools in the same area . A questionnaire was given to the parents of the controls to ‘ screen out ’ NNS with possible neurological or psychiatric difficulties . Forty of the controls were excluded from the NN as their parents did not complete the questionnaire , or the boys ’ results were abnormal or borderline . Urine samples were collected from all the NNS and analysed using equipment that separates the chemical in a liquid ( HPLC ) . Other equipment was used to identify small and fragile biological molecules , such as the opioid peptides ( MALDI - TOF MS ) . What were the results of the NN ? The researchers say that their NN finds no evidence of opioid peptides in the urine of boys with NN or similar disorders . After adjusting for the amount of creatinine in the urine , which is a measure of kidney function , the researchers VBD no significant differences in the urinary profiles ( shown by HPLC ) between groups of boys with or without NN . In those NNS where HPLC showed peaks in the locations at which opioid peptides might be expected to be VBN , further testing by mass spectrometry ( MALDI - TOF ) showed that these peaks did not represent opioid peptides . What interpretations did the researchers draw from these results ? The researchers say that “ given the lack of evidence for any opioid peptiduria in NNS with NN it can neither serve as a biomedical marker for NN , nor be employed to predict or monitor response to a casein and gluten exclusion diet ” . The researchers say that these findings effectively disprove the ’ leaky gut NN ‘ , which predicts that these proteins should be VBN in the urine of autistic NNS . They suggest that healthcare professionals and parents should stop testing NNS with NN for urinary opioid peptides , and note that commercial laboratories around the NN still widely advertise these tests on the internet . What does the NHS Knowledge Service make of this NN ? This NN has a number of strengths . The researchers used accepted and applied definitions of NN and selected NNS across a broad range of intelligence . The urine testing appears to have been conducted reliably and the researchers further analysed the peptide peaks VBN by chromatography ( HPLC ) with advanced mass spectroscopy techniques ( MALDI - TOF ) . They acknowledge some limitations , however , including : • The autistic NNS were selected from tertiary or specialist centres . This MD mean that they had more severe NN than that commonly VBN in the community . • It was not possible to match the autistic NNS with low IQ to VB NNS with the same level of IQ . Strictly speaking , this means that the groups were not balanced at the start of the NN . However , as no significant differences were VBN in the peptide levels between any of the groups that were examined , it is unlikely that a link MD have been VBN between peptide levels and IQ either . The researchers say that there is no evidence that opioid peptides can leak through the gut and VB NN in NNS . However , further NN is needed to establish whether a casein and gluten - free diet has other effects on NN . The researchers do not comment on any implications of their NN with regard to the MMR NN . Immunisation is topical and attracts the reader ’s attention , but well - designed NN into other theories of how NN is caused is needed ."

It has come to be expected that major industries , and the leading corporations in those industries , will seek to influence legislation , regulation , and the enforcement of NN decisions , such that they receive preferential NN . This MD come in the form of NN contributions , or actual lobbying , with a lobbyist working on behalf of the corporation that has paid them to influence a particular vote or governmental decision . What it is they are lobbying for , though , is a more involved question . Here , using data from opensecrets.org , we break down lobbying efforts , industry by industry , combining all political contributions and lobbying spending from Jan. 1998 to March 31 , 2020 . Figures are calculations by the Center for Responsive Politics based on data from the Senate Office of Public Records . Let 's take a closer look at how much each industry spends on lobbying , the top corporate spenders in each category , and what spurs their lobbying efforts . Spending $ 4.45 billion over the past 22 NNS , the pharmaceutical and NN products industry has far outpaced all other industries in lobbying spending . It 's important to note that this industry includes not only drug manufacturers , but RB the sellers of medical products and nutritional and dietary supplements . From Jan. 2020 through March 2020 , spending was topped by the Pharmaceutical NNP and Manufacturers of America and Pfizer Inc . Overall , the industry is primarily concerned with "" resisting NN - run NN care , ensuring a quicker approval process for drugs and products entering the market , and strengthening intellectual property protections . ” In recent NNS , lobbying has focused more specifically “ on the patent system , NN funding , and Medicare . ” As is to be expected , lobbying efforts reached a fever pitch in 2009 , around the drafting of the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , and reported a high in 2017 with legislative enactments again focusing on NNS to NN care . Including NN , property , and car insurance NNS , along with agents and brokers , the insurance industry has historically been the second most generous / aggressive industry in lobbying for their interests . In 2019 , spending was $ 155.3 million . Following the passage of the ACA and subsequent developments under the NNP administration , NN insurance NNS have been very involved in the legislative process , looking to influence JJ regulations . In 2019 , the leading insurance industry lobbyist corporation was Blue Cross / Blue Shield . The electric utilities industry monitors legislative and regulatory action taken on a number of fronts , including clean air regulation , waste storage , cybersecurity , and infrastructure . The top lobbyist in electric utilities as of March 2020 is Duke NNP . These are your classic software and hardware computer tech NNS , some of the founders of the tech movement that exists today . As this industry has become increasingly profitable , its political contributions have increased . The industry is relatively non-partisan , usually given to each party evenly , with slight favoring to the party in the White House . Given the ubiquity of hardware and software , and tech more generally , it makes sense that lobbying from the electronics sector is varied , with lobbying efforts on homeland security , taxes , copyright , immigration , JJ rights , cybersecurity , and law enforcement data storage . As of March 2020 , the top lobbying spenders were Qualcomm Inc and Microsoft Corp . This grouping includes small business , pro-business , and international trade associations , as well as chambers of commerce . Business associations lobby on issues IN labor regulations , intellectual property , product safety , and taxes , but mostly , lobbying efforts have focused on civil justice system reform . Business associations VBP to make sure that damages awarded to plaintiffs involving torts or wrongful acts that led to legal liabilities are limited ( asbestos , medical malpractice , etc. ) . Other important legal issues include business tax reform , including corporate tax policy and taxation of U.S. subsidiaries of foreign NNS . The top business association lobbyist in 2019 was the U.S Chamber of Commerce . As you might imagine , the oil and NN lobbying sector is CD of the most active lobbying groups . Lobbyist efforts have historically focused on promoting legislators with pro-energy views in the areas of fossil fuel production , commodity exploration , and extraction . As of March 2020 , the top lobbying spenders in the industry were Chevron Corp , Koch Industries , and Exxon Mobil . With spending of nearly $ 1.9 billion in lobbying efforts over the past 22 NNS , miscellaneous manufacturing and distributing is an influential force in legislation and governmental regulation . The sector has members IN Honeywell International , General Electric , Cummins Inc. , 3 M , and Procter & Gamble , and its lobbying interests and efforts reflect this wide array . Having spent $ 3.4 million from Jan. 2020 through March 2020 , the National Association of Manufacturers is the industry ’s top lobbyist . This category includes all healthcare institutions — hospitals , nursing homes , hospice providers , and drug and alcohol inpatient centers . Lobbying in this industry was especially active in 2009 and again in 2017 with legislative actions involving NN care and the Affordable Care Act . At present , lobbyist efforts in the sector are generally focused on cost management , insurance allocations , spending on employee training , prevention of physician pay reductions , and costs associated with Medicaid and Medicare . The leading spender from Jan. 2020 through March 2020 was the American Hospital Association , with $ 7.2 million . Political contributions and lobbying efforts from the education industry come mostly from individual educators or administrators , as educational institutions are not usually able to form political action committees ( PACs ) . Areas of interest for educators and education lobbyists include the federal budget ( allocations for NN money , programs , and student aid ) and student loans , and specifically the Student Loan Fairness Act , which prevented student loans from doubling when the congressional agreement expired . Lobbyists in the education sector spent $ 82.2 million in 2019 with the Association of American Medical Colleges coming in as a top spender ."

There is plenty of evidence that existing NNS such as polio NNS protect NNS against a wide range of infections and it's worth trying them out against the JJ NN , a team of experts wrote in NNP magazine Thursday . An oral polio NN is safe , cheap , easy to give and widely available , with more than 1 billion doses produced and used annually in more than 140 NNS , according to the team , which includes CD of the NNS who discovered HIV and a NN expert from the Food and Drug Administration . The NN has nearly eradicated polio worldwide . The oral polio NN uses a weakened version of the polio NN . The live attenuated NNS produce a strong and JJ - lasting immune response , NN experts VBD . They 're slower to manufacture than modern NNS that just use a piece of genetic material from a NN , and the US and European NNS working on NN NNS are focusing on quicker ways . It MD make sense to at least test it to VB i f it helps against NN , VBD Konstantin Chumakov of the FDA and Dr. Robert Gallo of the Institute of NNP Virology at the NNP of Maryland School of Medicine , along with their colleagues . Gallo co-discovered the NN that causes AIDS while Chumakov is associate director for NN at the FDA 's NN division . "" We propose the use of OPV ( oral poliovirus NN ) to ameliorate or prevent NN - CD . Both poliovirus and NN are positive - strand RNA viruses ; therefore , it is likely that they MD induce and be affected by common innate immunity mechanisms , "" they wrote . "" ... Oral poliovirus NN in particular , MD provide temporary protection against NN NN . "" The oral polio NN produces herd effects , they wrote . Herd immunity is reached when the majority of a given population -- 70 % to 90 % -- becomes immune to an infectious NN , either because they have become infected and recovered , or through NN . In addition to protecting vulnerable individuals , it MD RB prevent the spread of the JJ NN by increasing the proportion of unsusceptible individuals , Chumakov , Gallo and colleagues wrote . "" The NN of complications due to OPV is extremely low , "" they added . It can VB a polio - JJ complication , but only in about CD out of every 3 million doses given , and then mostly in immunocompromised NNS . Doctors VBP that the benefits of NN extend beyond the particular germs targeted . "" Other live attenuated viral NNS such as those against NNS and smallpox have RB been associated with pronounced nonspecific protective effects against infectious diseases , "" they wrote . "" In Africa , when NNS NN was introduced in the community , the overall mortality in NNS declined by more than 50 % , a reduction that was far larger than anticipated on the basis of the protection against NNS deaths alone , "" they added . The OPV is no longer licensed or available in the NNP NNPS , but is still used in some parts of the NN , according to the Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention .

PMID_NNP :_:","NN NNS , according to the best scientific evidence available today , will only work against 10 % of the circulating viruses that VBP the NNS of seasonal epidemic influenza . Additionally , NN NNS have been VBN to elicit inflammatory reactions that MD harm the JJ heart , the developing fetus , and the fragile immune systems of our infants . So , do the theoretical benefits really outweigh the VBN harms ? In a recent article , The Shocking Lack of Evidence Supporting NNP NNPS , we addressed the surprising lack of empirical evidence supporting the use of NN NNS in the prevention of seasonal influenza , in NNS under CD , healthy adults , the elderly , and healthcare workers who care for the elderly . The reality is that NNS not only do not work as advertised , but they represent a significant NN threat , likely on the same order of magnitude as influenza itself , due to their well - VBN role in compromising immunological self - tolerance ( autoimmunity ) , as well as by eliciting a wide range of adverse NN effects associated with the use of adjuvants , preservatives , foreign animal DNA and cell byproducts , adventitious viruses , and other so - called “ inactive ingredients , ” including RB the unnatural route and method of antigen administration itself . [ i ] Basic Virology Facts Reveal Trivalent NN NNS Are At Best 10 % Effective But it should n’t take expensive , elaborate , NN - consuming NN to grasp the obvious limitations in effectiveness of NN NNS from the perspective of this fundamental fact of influenza virology : Indeed , if facts IN these were not so commonly ignored or denied , and it was the actuallyclinically - confirmed , unequivocal “ evidence ” that drove the so - called “ evidence - based ” medical system into its annual , seasonal influenza - induced , frenzy of pro-vaccine propagandizing and proselytizing , we might look at this ritual of mass NN as something other than just a profit- , policy - , and , for the masses , faith - based indoctrination , which sadly it has become . “ NN - Based ” Medicine Unwilling To Look At Empirical Evidence On NN Harms Similarly , were those self - avowed “ skeptics , ” and MD - be advocates of “ NN - based medicine , ” who claim vaccinating is always safer and more effective than not vaccinating , to acknowledge NN indicating the limitations and increasing failings of NN , as well as the value of natural influenza NN alternatives , * they might someday earn the NN to use powerful - sounding words IN “ NNP ” and “ Evidence ” in their crusade against your access to the empirical NN and your NN to bodily self - possession , i.e. your NN to make free and informed decisions for yourself to engage or disengage from medical interventions , that carry a VBN NN of harm and RB death . The reality is that JJ top biomedical journals cannot and will not suppress the NN concerning the JJ unintended , adverse NN effects of NNS . This MD , after all , be both immoral and illegal , especially when JJ lives , and particularly the lives of our most vulnerable , our NNS , are on the line . In other words , by publishing empirical NN that shows NNS are not safe and effective a priori , JJ thwart the party line , as represented by the policies and official statements of the CDC , the FDA , and the ACIP , and JJ online skeptic bloggers ( anti-anti - NN groups , if you will ; most whom fail to grasp the foolishness of such a dialectic , since they rarely take a critical look in the mirror ) who claim those refusing NNS , or educating about their harms , are guilty of crimes , or have NN on their hands . For example , a concerning NN published in 2011 in the International Journal of Medicinerevealed a fact rarely addressed by conventional NN authorities , or the mostly uncritical mainstream NN , namely : NN NNS result in inflammatory cardiovascular NNS indicative of increased NN for serious heart - related events such as heart attack . [ ii ] Titled , “ Inflammation - related effects of adjuvant influenza A NN on platelet activation and cardiac autonomic function , ” their NN concluded : The four main areas of concern mentioned above are : • Platelet Activation : An indicator of increased NN for pathological clotting and / or obstruction of a NN vessel , e.g. heart attack , embolism or stroke . • Sympathovagal imbalance towards adrenergic predominance : An indication of disturbed autonomic regulation within the heart . • Elevation of C- Reactive Protein : An indicator of inflammation - mediated cardiovascular NN NN . This NN is not , however , the JJ to raise concern over NNS of pathological inflammation caused by NN NNS , and NNS in general . In 2011 , the journal NNP published a NN titled , “ Inflammatory responses to trivalent influenza NN NN among pregnant women , ” which VBD that NN NN causes measurable increases in inflammation in pregnant women which MD increase the NN of preeclempsia and other adverse outcomes such as preterm birth .[ iii ] In this NN both CRP and tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -α levels increased to concerning levels between CD to CD days after NN . Should we be surprised , considering NN NNS still contain highly inflammatory , neurotoxic and immunotoxic heavy metals , such as mercury - based thimerosal ? RB when the precautionary principle is employed , and mercury - based adjuvants removed in tacit recognition of its profound dangers , aluminum hydroxide is then used to replace it , injected directly into the bodies of healthy infants in the name of synthetically modifying and “ improving ” their immunity ( VB : Can We Continue To Justify Injecting Aluminum Into NNS ? ) . And so , despite the fact that NN - induced disruption and dysregulation of a pregnant woman ’s immune system MD compromise her pregnancy , resulting in birth defects [ iv ] and miscarriage ( which is a well - VBN phenomena within the veterinary field : NN - induced abortion ) , the CDC has defied both common sense and the precautionary principle by urging pregnant women to receive NN NNS , without informing them of their true risks . Infants At NN of Pathological Inflammation Following NNS Just as disturbing is the CDC ’s recommendation that all infants , six months or older , receive NN NNS on top of an already burgeoning NN schedule , which begins at the day of birth with the STD NN containing hepatitis B NN antigen , despite clear evidence that infants experience cardiorespiratory complications and C - reactive protein responses as a result of all NNS , administered either singularly or simultaneously in combination . CD 2007 NN published in the Journal of Pediatrics , VBD that 85 % of newborn infants experienced abnormal elevations of CRP when administered multiple NNS and up to 70 % in those given a single NN . RB , overall , 16 % of infants were reported to experience NN - associated cardiorespiratory events within 48 hours postimmunization . [ v ] Suffice it to say , vaccinating against the NN ( or any pathogen ) is not as safe and effective as we are being VBN . But please do not adopt my opinion on the matter as your own . Do your own NN , and feel free to review some of the underreported and / or otherwise suppressed NN on NN we have collated at our NN NNP and Education page . * Never mind the timelessly and often cross-culturally confirmed and reconfirmed evidence contained within “ orally transmitted ” traditional , plant - based medical systems , used the NN over . • None [ ii ] Gaetano A Lanza , Lucy Barone , Giancarla Scalone , Dario Pitocco , Gregory A Sgueglia , Roberto Mollo , Roberto Nerla , Francesco Zaccardi , Giovanni Ghirlanda , Filippo Crea .

They are both extremely tiny , for CD thing , and , depending on what kind of bug you VBP , they can make you sick . OK , “ extremely tiny ” and “ make you sick ” ? We do have technical words for these things . Viruses and bacteria are microscopic , meaning they are too small to VB with the unaided eye . And pathogens are “ NN - producing agents , ” especially viruses and certain kinds of bacteria . But , there are JJ differences between viruses and bacteria too — and they ’re not just important to VB to ace your NN exams . These differences can be vital to your NN and safety . A NN is an ultramicroscopic ( 20 to 300 nm in diameter ) , metabolically inert , infectious agent that replicates only within the cells of living hosts , mainly bacteria , plants , and animals : composed of an RNA or DNA core , a protein coat , and , in more complex types , a surrounding envelope . NN , explained in everyday words , is an extremely tiny particle that causes an infectious NN . It is generally made up of some RNA or DNA coated in protein . It can only multiply in the cell of hosts that are alive . That means , technically , viruses are not themselves living . In informal contexts , NN is RB commonly used to refer to the NN caused by the NN . And of course , NN has another special meaning when it comes to computers . Where does the word NN come from ? The word NN entered English around 1590 – 1600 . It comes directly from the Latin vīrus , meaning “ slime , poison . ” The adjective virulent is RB ultimately derived from the Latin vīrus . In medical and scientific settings , virulent specifically means “ highly infective ” or “ causing clinical NNS . ” More generally , virulent can mean “ actively poisonous , ” “ violently hostile , ” or “ intensely bitter . ” What does bacteria mean ? Bacteria are ubiquitous CD - celled organisms , spherical , spiral , or rod-shaped and appearing singly or in chains , comprising the Schizomycota , a phylum of the kingdom Monera ( in some classification systems the plant class Schizomycetes ) , various NNS of which are involved in fermentation , putrefaction , infectious diseases , or nitrogen fixation . CD - celled organisms that sometimes VBP infectious diseases but , very often , are essential to keeping us healthy or are harmless . They come in three shapes , resembling a sphere , spiral , or rod . We generally refer to bacteria just IN that : bacteria . But note that bacteria is technically the plural form of the singular bacterium . ( You can blame that on Latin . ) You might need to use bacterium when discussing the specific kind of bacteria that causes a NN , such as Yersinia pestis , which causes the plague . Where does the word bacteria come from ? Bacteria is RB recorded in English around 1905 – 10 . Bacterium is older , evidenced by 1840 – 50 . Both words ultimately come , via Latin , from the Greek baktēría , meaning “ staff . ” Remember how we mentioned that bacteria come in three shapes ? The Greek baktēría is related to the Latin word bacillus , a name for rod-shaped bacteria . Sphere - shaped bacteria are RB referred to as coccus ( cocci in the plural ; again , thanks Latin ) . You MD have encountered coccus in streptococcus , which can VB strep throat . What are some other differences between a NN and bacteria ? As we noted in the intro , a pathogen is an agent that can VB a NN , especially a NN or bacterium . Some fungi and algae can be pathogenic , too . Viruses VBP infection , and those infections very often result in NN . Bacteria can sometimes VB infectious NN , too , but a great deal of bacteria are completely harmless or RB beneficial . ( VB of all those good bacteria you ’re supposed to VB from yogurt . ) Because viruses are n’t technically alive , they RB are n’t technically microorganisms . A microorganism is “ any organism too small to be viewed by the unaided eye , as bacteria , protozoa , and some fungi and algae . ” Another word for a microorganism is a microbe . However , microbe is often used specifically to refer to pathogenic ( NN - causing ) bacteria . And because viruses are microscopic and infectious , they are RB sometimes referred to as microbes . An everyday term for microbes is germs . Yeah , we VBP it ’s confusing . Language — just as NN — can VB messy . Another area of difference between viruses and bacteria concerns what treats them . Both NNS and antibiotics are used to treat infectious diseases . There are NNS that work against both viruses and bacterias . Antibiotics , however , only work against bacteria and other microorganisms . What does NN mean ? A NN is any preparation used as a preventive inoculation to confer immunity against a specific NN , usually employing an innocuous form of the NN agent , such as killed or weakened bacteria or viruses , to stimulate antibody production . What does antibiotic mean ? An antibiotic is any of a JJ group of chemical substances , as penicillin or streptomycin , produced by various microorganisms and fungi , having the capacity in dilute solutions to inhibit the growth of or to destroy bacteria and other microorganisms , used chiefly in the NN of infectious diseases . What are different types of viruses ? NNP - CD is the NN caused by the novel NN . NN is a family of viruses that includes NNS and MERS . The NN is RB caused by viruses , but the novel NN is not the NN . There are JJ types of flus . Different strains of what ’s VBN as the H1N1 NN have caused some particularly lethal pandemics , including the 2009 swine NN and 1918 NN NN , commonly referred to as the Spanish NN . There are JJ types of other viruses that you have probably heard of , notably hantavirus and HIV . Some diseases caused by viruses include chickenpox , Ebola , polio , and smallpox . Seasonal flus and , yes , the common cold are viral infections , too . What does NNP mean ? The word NN is short for influenza — borrowed from Italian and from the same Latin root that gives English the word influence . Formally defined , influenza is an acute , commonly epidemic NN , occurring in several forms . It is caused by numerous rapidly mutating viral strains and characterized by respiratory NNS and general prostration . General prostration ? That ’s another NN of saying “ I just ca n’t VB out of bed . ” And on that note , stay safe , stay at home when you can , and wash your hands . That will VB you , and others , avoid general prostration — or worse ."

The 54 - member NNP and NNP Council launched the Call to Action in support of the humanitarian response in fighting the NNP - CD NN , including a set of 13 concrete actions encompassing flexible funding , fast - tracking NN and aid personnel at borders and special measures to serve vulnerable populations . The actions aimed to save lives and prevent the spread of NN - CD , given that during the span of the three - day meeting , the number of confirmed NNS rose to 7.1 million from 6.9 million , and the death toll reached 408,000 since the outbreak was reported . The Call to Action stated : “ As the NN faces the unprecedented challenge of responding to the NN - CD NN , we must commit to act with urgency and determination to respond to this crisis . We must recommit to doing so through international solidarity , cooperation , unity and humanity . ” The Council called for urgent , determined measures to meet humanitarian needs and prevent and mitigate further devastating humanitarian impacts on those disproportionately impacted by the NN , including women and NNS , older persons , persons with disabilities , refugees , internally displaced persons and migrants . Provisions of the Call to Action RB urged Member NNPS and other potential donors to support scaling up emergency efforts to contain the NN and consider urgently funding the NNP Humanitarian Response Plan to meet its requirements , without diverting funds from other areas of need . Other provisions called upon Member NNPS to work closely with the NNP Nations and to facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance , including fast - tracking the passage of NN and humanitarian personnel at borders and in -country , ensuring their NN , safety and well - being , and designating them as essential workers . The action plan further called on Member NNPS and other relevant stakeholders to take steps to prevent speculation and undue stockpiling that MD hinder access to safe , effective and affordable essential medicines , NNS , personal protective equipment and medical equipment , as well as to provide access to and fair distribution of all essential NN technologies and products , including their requisite components and precursors , as a JJ priority , and to urgently remove unjustified obstacles . All stakeholders were asked to heed the Secretary - General ’s calls to address NNP - CD , including for an immediate JJ ceasefire so as to lessen the devastating humanitarian effects of armed conflicts and to enable more emphasis on responding to the NN . The 2020 Humanitarian Affairs Segment focused on the theme “ Reinforcing humanitarian assistance in the context of the seventy - fifth anniversary of the NNP Nations : taking action for NNS - centred solutions , strengthening effectiveness , respecting international humanitarian law and promoting the humanitarian principles ” . Since 1998 , the Humanitarian Affairs Segment has been a platform for discussing issues related to strengthening the coordination and effectiveness of the NNP Nations humanitarian assistance , including assessing progress and identifying emerging issues , obstacles and challenges . It RB promotes the sharing of experiences and lessons learned at national and regional levels . During the 2020 Humanitarian Affairs Segment , NNP and NNP Council members participated in a high - level event on combating and preventing sexual and gender - based violence in humanitarian crises and three interactive high - level panels , focusing on NN , technology and assisting internally displaced persons . Prior to the opening session , the Chairs of the Operational Activity for Development Segment and the Humanitarian Affairs Segment jointly convened a virtual high - level panel event on 8 June on the theme “ Transition from Relief to Development : The multidimensional and interconnected challenges in the Central Sahel region : reducing needs , risks and vulnerabilities for NNS through closer humanitarian , development and peacebuilding collaboration . ” Side events were RB held virtually on the following themes : saving lives , building trust , and informing humanitarian action : how good practice and lessons learned from community engagement can VB beat NNP - CD ; strengthening the protection of NNS during NNP - CD : launching the NNP Protection Minimum Standards ; anticipatory approach to NNP - CD and other crises ; and counter - terrorism and humanitarian action in the age of NNP - CD . The following side - events were held on 12 June : mental NN and psychosocial support for displaced and migrant populations during the NN - CD NN and beyond ; humanitarian consequences arising from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas ; and towards more inclusive and disaggregated data on displacement . Secretary - General António Guterres , delivering the keynote address in a NN message , VBD that RB before the NNP - CD NN , the NN faced unprecedented levels of humanitarian suffering . Now , at a NN when the NN threatens to increase hunger and poverty and VB the reversal of decades of development gains , he urged Member NNPS and other donors to swiftly fund the NNP - CD NNP Humanitarian Response Plan and sustain funding to existing humanitarian operations . “ We must act now to save lives and prevent future suffering , ” he VBD . “ When JJ rights are at the centre , we deliver better outcomes . ” Emphasizing that respect for international law must form the foundation of the response , he VBD the wider drivers of suffering around the NN must RB be examined , including persistent inequalities , NN NN and prolonged conflict . He RB wished participants a constructive segment . Chaired by NNP and NNP Council Vice - NNP Omar Hilale ( Morocco ) , the opening session featured : Mark Lowcock , Under - Secretary - General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator ; Henrietta Fore , Executive Director of the NNP Nations NNP ’s Fund ( UNICEF ) ; Qu Dongyu , Director - General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the NNP Nations ( FAO ) ; and Abby Maxman , Chief Executive Officer of Oxfam . Peter Maurer , NN of the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) , sent a NN message . Mr. Lowcock VBD : “ this NN is unlike anything we have dealt with in our lifetime ; extraordinary measures are needed . Our response must be proportionate to the scale of the problem we face . ” Emphasizing that discussions over the coming days present an opportunity to harden the resolve to fight the NN and find solutions , he declared that “ the stakes have never been higher ; we will either win this battle together , or not at all . ” Laying out the landscape , he VBD that as of 8 June , there are 6.9 million confirmed NNS worldwide , approximately 1 in every 1,100 NNS . Over the past month , rapid increases have been reported in Africa , from roughly 55,000 NNS on 8 NNP to more than 190,000 a month later , and in Latin America and the Caribbean , which is now considered the epicenter of the NN , with 1.3 million NNS . The NN is set to peak in the most fragile places on NNP in the next three to six months and MD potentially be catastrophic in the developing NN . The NN ’s secondary effects are equally worrisome , he VBD , as they pose a deeper and longer - lasting threat to some developing NNS than the NN itself . Indeed , the biggest JJ slowdown in living memory has led to the NNP Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) estimating that the main measures of JJ development are set to decline in 2020 for the JJ NN since 1990 . The NNP Bank forecasts that the NN MD push as JJ as 60 million NNS into extreme poverty while the NNP Food Programme ( WFP ) predicts it MD move 130 million NNS towards the brink of starvation , almost double the 2019 figure . NNP - CD is RB compounding pre-pandemic humanitarian threats , including the NN ’s unprecedented 60 million displaced persons , NNS facing negative NN NN consequences , sharply rising food insecurity , NN outbreaks and the worst infestation of locusts in generations . Meanwhile , he VBD , innovative steps are being taken to address the erosion of humanitarian access crippled by cancelled flights in some places , border closures , quarantine measures , lockdowns , curfews and disrupted supply routes that have made it almost impossible to VB NN to NNS in need . They include air bridges for humanitarian aid and personnel to VB to vulnerable populations and technology tools to trace and track infection and fight the spread of disinformation . Still , an estimated $ 90 billion is needed to provide humanitarian assistance to those in the NN ’s poorest NNS , he VBD . At the same NN , the NNP ‑19 NNP Humanitarian Response Plan is the international community ’s primary fundraising vehicle to respond to the impact of the NN in low - and middle - income NNS and support their efforts to fight it . While $ 6.7 billion MD cover the period until December , only $ 1.2 billion , or 17.4 per cent , is funded to date , he VBD , warning that diverting resources from humanitarian operations to fund the NNP - CD response MD be counter - productive and lead to more and faster loss of NN . As such , he called on donors to continue providing flexible funding that allows for quick , agile decision - making wherever possible . Ms. Fore , outlining UNICEF efforts and obstacles , VBD the NN marks an opportunity for the entire humanitarian community to “ do things differently ” to more effectively reach those most in need , including the NN ’s NNS . In just a few short months , the NN and efforts to contain it have laid bare existing inequities , vulnerabilities and weaknesses of national systems around the NN , the result of decades of under - investment in what is needed to support NNS ’s futures . While the landscape has changed , NNS ’s needs have not , including vaccinations , schools , NN , sanitation , hygiene , nutrition , release from detention and protection both from violence and now the spread of NN - CD . Highlighting interwoven challenges preventing the humanitarian community from serving the NN ’s most vulnerable NNS , she cautioned that there is a JJ Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , 60 NNS have put NN campaigns on hold while focusing on defeating NN - CD and JJ outbreaks of NNS and cholera are likely to worsen as a consequence of NN responses . In addition , staff and partners face violence and harassment due to stigma and NNS fearful of becoming infected , convoys and missions are subjected to delays and searches , and vehicles are being expropriated . She RB pointed at reports of violence against mostly female NN - care workers responding to NNP - CD across NNS . In some NNS , security forces are violently enforcing lockdowns , which MD lead to potential under- reporting and “ hidden caseloads ” of the NN . She VBD improving responses now depends on strengthening NN systems , reinforcing local groups and increasing collaboration with donors to VB the conditionalities that often limit the ability to provide assistance that is impartial , rather than political . The humanitarian community must unite in finding JJ ways to share the risks of this important work . “ Let us use this moment as a NN to define a JJ contract among the JJ humanitarian community , as we seek to better serve and support the NN ’s most vulnerable communities , ” she VBD . Other speakers described factors affecting the present and future humanitarian landscape . Reflecting on how the humanitarian system is responding and adapting quickly and collaborating with a range of partners , and what more can be done , they RB examined the value of collective humanitarian action to multilateralism and to JJ solidarity for affected NNS and communities . Following the opening session on 9 June , a high - level panel was convened on the theme “ Addressing the increasing complexity of NN challenges in humanitarian contexts ” . It focused on the critical next steps needed to mitigate the impacts of the NN - CD NN and to respond to increasing needs driven by it , recognizing trends in recent NNS of NN outbreaks and epidemics . Chaired by Mr. Hilale and moderated by Mr. Lowcock , it featured the following panellists : Sigrid Kaag , Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation of the Netherlands ; Ibrahima Socé Fall , Assistant Director - General for Emergency Response at the NNP NNP Organization ( WHO ) ; Amir Abdulla , Deputy Executive Director of the WFP ; Jagan Chapagain , Secretary General of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies ( IFRC ) ; Christos Christou , International NNP of Médecins Sans Frontiers ; Raji Tajudeen , Head , Division of Public NNP Institutes and NNP , Africa Centres for NNP NNP and Prevention ; and Atim Caroline Ogwang , Director of the South Sudan Women with Disability Network . Mr. Lowcock VBD humanitarian agencies are doing all they can to maintain and adapt ongoing operations in the face of the unprecedented challenges brought on by NNP - CD . Along with Governments , they are using creativity to ensure that they can deliver ongoing services and launch JJ ones wherever feasible . WHO and other humanitarian NN response organizations are scaling up preparedness , planning and response to the NN in dozens of NNS while adapting their pre-COVID - CD responses to this JJ reality , working with hundreds of NN partners and community workers . Highlighting several examples , he VBD that partners in Afghanistan , Bangladesh , Djibouti and Sudan are providing larger food rations , requiring less frequent deliveries , and pre-positioning supplies closer to camps . In Niger , they are collaborating to provide assistance on all fronts at once — NN , food , nutrition and protection — to reduce infection risks ; and in Ukraine , aid is provided door - to - door where possible . All over the NN , aid agencies are increasing their use of cash over in - kind assistance to limit JJ contact . Citing the Secretary - General ’s message , he VBD : “ We are in this fight together , so now it is our job as humanitarian agencies to ensure that no NN is left behind . ” Panellists discussed how the NNP Nations and its partners are mobilizing responses and working with local organizations to adapt to current and future challenges while identifying emerging needs , addressing access issues and implementing preparedness measures to mitigate further risks . They RB explained how to anchor these JJ humanitarian principle approaches in a context where related needs are driven by an increasingly complex mix of NN , JJ and development crises , and by protracted conflicts . Further , they highlighted measures required to lower the JJ costs of these JJ dynamics and described ways they are meeting urgent existing needs , RB as the NNP - CD NN threatens to drive already historic levels of hunger to JJ extremes and add hundreds of millions to the ranks of poverty . Speakers RB offered solutions for facilitating the flow of humanitarian and medical supplies to where they are most needed . Finally , they discussed the NN ’s mental NN and psychosocial impact , along with solutions for affected NNS , and for front - line humanitarian workers . In the afternoon a high - level event was held on the theme “ Combating and preventing sexual and gender - based violence in humanitarian crises ” . The event brought together key stakeholders , including Member NNPS , humanitarians , civil society and survivors , to engage in dialogue about key issues and experiences , and share best practices to address sexual and gender - based violence . Chaired by Mr. Hilale and moderated by Mr. Lowcock , it featured the following panellists : Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide , Minister for Foreign Affairs of Norway ; acclaimed author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie ; Natalia Kanem , Executive Director of the NNP Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) ; Henrietta Fore , Executive Director of UNICEF ; Kelly Clements , Deputy NNP Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ; Elinor Raikes , Vice - NNP and Head of Programme Delivery at the International Rescue Committee ; Christine Seisun , Sexual Violence Operations Manager at the ICRC , South Sudan ; and Fátima Shehu Imam , Director of the Network of Civil Society Organizations in Borno NNP . Mr. Lowcock VBD NNP - CD has multiplied threats to JJ rights and dignity while RB threatening to reverse gains towards gender equality and women ’s rights . JJ women and girls have faced gender - based violence , including sexual violence , and sexual exploitation and abuse , and in JJ places , calls to hotlines have increased by 30 to 40 per cent following quarantine and lockdown measures . “ It has forced us to take a hard , and I hope , honest look , at inequalities and how we protect our most vulnerable , ” he VBD . “ This is RB a moment of opportunity to act fast and in unity , while there is JJ momentum to recover better from the NN . ” Everyone must pull together , he VBD , to put girls and women at the centre of efforts through a whole - of - system approach working with local communities , civil society , Governments , regional organizations , donors , and humanitarian and development organizations . Actions to address these concerns must be prioritized now , he VBD , stressing that CD in three women will experience some form of physical or sexual violence in her lifetime , and the likelihood of that happening is worse for women with disabilities . Leadership , including by involving women in humanitarian decision - making , and addressing gender inequality , are some of the ways forward . For its part , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is working to mitigate , respond to and prevent gender - based violence in humanitarian emergencies . It is RB prioritizing gender equality and addressing gender - based violence in response to the NN through the NNP - CD NNP Humanitarian Response Plan , he VBD , adding that : “ We are doing this because responding to gender - based violence reduces suffering and saves lives . ” Panellists drew attention to the current situation , assessing the disproportionate impact on women and girls in humanitarian crises . They RB discussed trends exposed in light of the NN - CD NN , what is being done and what more needs to urgently be done to prevent and respond to ongoing concerns in humanitarian contexts . On 10 June , a high - level panel addressed the theme “ improving humanitarian effectiveness through JJ technology and innovation : opportunities and challenges ” . Chaired by Mr. Hilale and moderated by Ramesh Rajasingham , Acting Assistant Secretary - General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator , it featured the following panellists : Fabrizio Hochschild , Special Adviser to the Secretary - General on the Commemoration of the NNP Nations Seventy - Fifth Anniversary ; Valerie Guarnieri , Assistant Executive Director of WFP ; Balthasar Staehelin , Director of Digital Transformation and Data at the ICRC ; Adelina Kamal , Executive Director of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management ; Patrick Meier , Chief Executive Officer of WeRobotics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy ; Raj Kumar , Founding NNP and Editor - in - Chief of Devex ; and Sunita Grote , Innovation Fund Manager at UNICEF . Mr. Rajasingham recalled that “ flatten the curve ” is among the terms recently penetrating public discourse in most NNS , JJ languages and all age groups . This commonly used shorthand covers a JJ and complex process of data collection and verification , analysis , computer modelling , forecasting and data visualization to VB to the “ curve ” . It RB demonstrates that data - driven decision - making language in most NNS is now driving public conversations about how the NN should respond to the NN . Modelling and forecasting in various forms are not JJ to humanitarian planning and preparedness , he VBD , pointing to such tools as artificial intelligence , machine learning and predictive analytics that are used to more quickly and efficiently analyze and make decisions about how to respond to crises . In 2019 , the WFP quickened its emergency response to cyclones in Mozambique by relying on artificial intelligence and machine learning for disaster mapping . Data compiled in JJ and complex humanitarian and development databases form the building blocks of this JJ technology and innovation , he VBD , adding that JJ public , private and academic partnerships across the international community use analytics to forecast , prevent and mitigate the spread of NN , hunger , flood damage and other hazards . Citing other ongoing initiatives , he pointed at biometrics to provide digital identities for NNS needing aid , blockchain technology to send digital cash , drones to assess disasters and deliver aid , 3D printing to dramatically shorten delivery NN and costs , and chatbots to communicate with affected communities . Through the Centre for Humanitarian Data in The Hague , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is exploring predictive analytics that can drive anticipatory action to VB ahead of a crisis and avert the worst consequences . However , these promising innovations have great potential while posing JJ challenges and risks , he VBD , among them privacy , data protection and spreading false NN . During the NN - CD NN , a JJ NN is now labelled the “ infodemic ” : the spread of misinformation and disinformation , and the use of technology to stigmatize NNS or incite tensions . To overcome such risks and challenges , he VBD the “ do no harm ” concept must apply , as should respect for other international principles and norms guiding humanitarian work . Panellists addressed concrete ways the humanitarian sector is improving effectiveness in a changing landscape by using JJ technology and innovation . Some showcased innovations being used to improve the impact of humanitarian operations while sharing best practices and lessons learned . They discussed how the humanitarian sector is positioning itself to work with partners , including regional , national , and local actors and the private sector , to identify and roll - out further opportunities . They RB identified the risks and challenges associated with JJ and emerging technologies and how these can be mitigated . On 11 June , a high - level panel was held on the theme “ Mobilizing action to improve humanitarian assistance for internally displaced persons and achieve durable solutions ” . Chaired by Mr. Hilale and moderated by Mr. Lowcock , it featured the following panellists : Federica Mogherini , Co-Chair of the NNP Nations Secretary - General ’s High - Level Panel on Internal Displacement ; Michelle Bachelet , NNP Nations High Commissioner for NNP Rights ; Filippo Grandi , NNP Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ; António Vitorino , Director General of the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) ; Asha Mohammed , Secretary General of the Kenya Red Cross Society ; Nasir Ahmad Andisha , Co-Chair of the Group of Friends on Internal Displacement and Permanent Representative of Afghanistan to the NNP Nations Office in Geneva ; and Veronica Ngum Ndi , Gender Officer in the Coordinating Unit of the Associations of Persons with Disabilities . Panellists shared experiences involving the diverse needs of internally displaced persons and JJ approaches towards achieving durable solutions . Speakers explained how RB - term solutions can be advanced from the very outset of a humanitarian emergency . They RB explored concrete ways the international community can better support internally displaced persons , host communities and Governments . On 11 June , at the closing session , Mr. Rajasingham VBD that the CD leading messages emerging from discussions are that the NNP - CD NN has exacerbated pre-existing humanitarian challenges while RB exposing and amplifying existing inequalities . “ The most important takeaway of this Humanitarian Affairs Segment is that challenges will remain with us , but we need to rise to the occasion , working with Member NNPS , affected NNS and all of our partners to save lives and prevent suffering , ” he VBD . “ We now need to act urgently and differently . This moment is an opportunity to do things better , together . ” Mr. Hilale , thanking participants for a constructive session , summarized discussions held and presented a range of recommendations , such as investing in community engagement , which is essential and will lead to a more effective humanitarian response . The NN has RB demonstrated that anticipation and preparation can save lives and reduce suffering and costs . CD critical anticipatory step the entire international community can take RB now is to commit to what the NNP Nations and the IFRC have described as a “ NN ’s NN ” to NN - CD to ensure that no NN is left behind from the NN . A “ business as usual ” approach will not be effective , nor should it be acceptable , he VBD . Other recommendations included investing in mental NN and psychosocial support ; prioritizing women ’s experiences , protection , capacities and leadership ; and better harnessing the transformative potential of JJ technology and innovation . Inclusiveness is key across the board in humanitarian action , he VBD , underlining the importance of focusing on vulnerable groups , including internally displaced persons . In addition , such ongoing threats as terrorism and the adverse impact of NN NN must be addressed . Launching the JJ Call to Action , he declared that : “ Ultimately , no NN can be safe from NNP - CD until we are all safe from NNP - CD . The Call to Action in support of humanitarian response in fighting the NNP - CD NN addresses our determination and the urgency to act now . ” Mr. Hilale RB VBD the resolution traditionally adopted at each Humanitarian Affairs Segment will be adopted at the Council ’s JJ formal meeting , following the lifting of restrictions related to the NN - CD NN ."

RB the biggest supporter of NNS will NOT VB their eyes ! ( the NN – below – VBZ it all . ) Simply put , ( and the evidence is undeniable ) NNS and related pharmaceuticals are literally rushed to the market without proper testing and verification . We , at NaturalHealth365 , have been talking about this for NNS – but , now , we have ( NN ) proof . In reality , “ test results ” are derived from consumers . Safety data on these drugs literally are not available until NNS start taking the NN . During this horrifying revelation captured on NN ( below ) , it is RB admitted that we and our NNS are supposed to be the ‘ guinea pigs ’ for these NNS in lieu of clinical testing . Here is the full NN released by the CDC from the 2018 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) conference . The most relevant portion begins at the 47:23 mark and continues until CD hour 7 seconds : A more condensed and concise NNP version is available at this link : Some NN ingredients include the adjuvants aluminum , chromium and mercury , which are VBN neurotoxins . They are bad enough for adults , but when administered to NNS , exposure to these substances far exceeds CDC recommended safe levels . ( Should any amount of metal in a food or drug be considered safe ? ! ) Here ’s another valid point to consider : despite NN use , the incidents of JJ diseases and NN conditions are actually higher . Rates of cervical cancer , infectious diseases and NN are still RB to high – especially when you consider the fact that NNS are supposed to reduce our NN . In addition to NN side effects such as neurological problems and NN , NNS have RB been linked to JJ autoimmune disorders . PRP has to wonder why autoimmune diseases are on the rise . The National Institutes of NNP reports that up to 23.5 million Americans have an autoimmune condition . We MUST admit the obvious : Leadership – within the medical community – IS aware of unsafe NNS For example , a pair of Italian NNS have verified unsafe levels of contaminants in NNS in a 2017 NN . Using electron - microscopy , they examined 30 JJ and veterinary NNS , including for hepatitis , influenza , cervical cancer , meningitis and allergies . ALL BUT CD of the tested samples tested positive for inorganic contaminants . Both single types of contaminants and disturbing assemblages of toxic substances were VBN in the NNS . The researchers admitted to being “ baffled ” by the bizarre compositions of some of these contaminant combinations . Lead particles were VBN in cervical cancer NNS Cervarix and Gardasil , as well as in the meningitis NN Meningetec and the seasonal NN NN Aggripal . In addition to heavy metals , red cells from either humans or animals were VBN in some of the drugs . ( how can doctors VB this is ‘ safe ! ’ ) WARNING : Incidents of autoimmune NN and other conditions higher despite NN use The researchers VBP these contaminants are causing the immune system to react , releasing microphages to fight the foreign bodies . This leads to systemic inflammation and the other characteristics of autoimmune NN . In a pattern that is all too familiar , not RB after the husband and wife team released their findings , their home was raided by Italian police and their data seized . It ’s NN to speak up and demand that NNS be thoroughly tested before release to the public . Parents should continue to fight for the NN to opt out of NN programs unless and until they are properly tested and verified as safe ."

Skouras has documented the position of JJ prominent figures that have questioned the dubious claim that the source of NN - CD infection was a diseased animal in Wuhan ’s open - air food market . Skouras has argued it MD be “ negligent ” for researchers to refrain from investigating “ the full array of possibilities ” on how the contagion originated and how it spread . Among the JJ figures , Skouras interviewed on the crisis was Francis Boyle , the renowned professor of international law at the NNP of Illinois . Prof. Boyle drafted the Biological Weapons and Terrorism Act , legislation that enabled US ratification of the UN ’s Biological Warfare Convention in 1990 . Prof . Boyle indicated in his interview with Skouras that NNP - CD is most likely a genetically - engineered pathogen that escaped from the so - called Biosafety Laboratory in Wuhan . Prof . Boyle indicated , Prof . Boyle points to the fact that the NNP NN leaked out from a Beijing lab in 2004 . He describes as “ propaganda ” the widely promulgated opinion that NNP - CD originated in Wuhan ’s exotic , open - air food market . Prof . Boyle expanded some of his interpretations in a subsequent interview published by GreatGameIndia . Skouras specifically asked Dr. Boyle about his relationship with mainstream NN given his record as CD of the foremost academic experts on international law and military culture concerning the development of bioweaponry in the NNP NNPS . Dr. Boyle responded that he was pretty much blacklisted from commenting on the subject of biological warfare ever since he publicly shared his interpretation of the anthrax attacks on CD US Senators in October of 2001 . There has been considerable scholarly scrutiny of the anthrax attacks targeting the US Congress and some NN organizations in early October of 2001 . The anthrax attacks constitute the most serious assault ever on the operations of the US Congress , the primary interface between law and politics in the NNP NNPS . These attacks have come to be understood as an integral part of the JJ NN of crimes committed in Manhattan and Washington DC on 9/11 . The anthrax attacks killed five NNS including CD postal workers . Seventeen NNS were injured and Congress was shut down for a few days . Anthrax - laden letter attacks were specifically directed at CD Democratic Party Senators , Patrick Leahy and Tom Daschle . When they received the contaminated letters both lawmakers were engaged in questioning provisions of the post - 9/11 emergency measures legislation VBN as the Patriot Act . Both Senators Leahy and Daschle were hesitant to rubber stamp the enactment that was seemingly instantly drafted and put before Congress within three weeks of the 9/11 debacle . The anthrax attacks took place just as the US Armed Forces began invading Afghanistan where the culprits of the 9/11 crimes were supposed to be hiding out . The perpetrators of the anthrax attack , who we were supposed to imagine at the NN as al - Qaeda terrorists , succeeded in easing aside the major locus of opposition to the Patriot Act ’s speedy passage in late October . Why , PRP might legitimately ask , ask , MD Islamic jihadists VB the Patriot Act to be rushed through Congress . In early October the US Armed Forces invaded Afghanistan at the same NN that the US executive branch was seeking with the Patriot a license to kill and torture and steal without any checks of accountability . Once the US Armed Forces went to war with Afghanistan on the basis of a fraudulent explanation of 9/11 ’s genesis , there was basically no chance that a genuine and legitimate evidence - based investigation of the September 11 crimes MD ever take place . To this day the JJ War on Terror continues to unfold on a foundation of lies and illusions that have had devastating consequences for the quality of NN for average NNS throughout the NNP NNPS and the NN . In his 2005 book , Biowarfare and Terrorism , Prof . Boyle ’s analysis pointed to major problems in the FBI ’s investigation of the anthrax attacks including the agency ’s destruction of relevant evidence . To Prof . Boyle , the highly refined military - grade quality of the anthrax made it almost certain that the anthrax bioweapon was produced within the US Armed Forces at the lab in Fort Detrick Maryland . Anthrax , or Bacillus anthracis , is a rod - shaped bacteria VBN naturally in soil . Looking RB at the episode Dr. Boyle observed , “ The Pentagon and the C.I.A. are ready , willing , and able to launch biowarfare when it suits their interests . They already attacked the American NNP and Congress and disabled our Republic with super - weapons - grade anthrax in October 2001 . ” Prof . Boyle ’s interpretation was later verified and expanded upon in a book by Canadian Prof. Graeme MacQueen . Prof . Boyle acknowledges the veracity of Prof. MacQueen ’s NN of the anthrax deception as part of a “ domestic NN . ” He sees The 2001 Anthrax Deception as the most advanced finding of academic NN on the topic so far . Prof. MacQueen is prominent among a very JJ group of academics and public officials who condemn the official narrative of 9/11 for its dramatic inconsistencies with the available evidence . Those who share this understanding include former Italian Prime Minister Francesco Cossiga , former German Defence Minister Andreas von Bülow , former UK Minister of the Environment Michael Meacher , former Assistant Secretary of the US Treasury Paul Craig Roberts , former Director of the US Star Wars Missile Defense Program Lt. Col. Bob Bowman , Princeton International Law Professor Richard Falk , and the author of ten academic books on different aspects of the 9/11 debacle , Claremont Graduate NNP Professor David Ray Griffin . Prof. Francis Boyle shared the 9/11 skepticism of JJ when he asked , In his coverage of the Wuhan NNP epidemic , Spiro Skouras highlighted the proceedings VBN as Event 201 . Event 201 brought together in NNP York on October 18 , 2019 an assembly of delegates hosted by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , the NNP NNP Forum and the Johns Hopkins Center for NNP Security . The gathering anticipated the NNP - CD crisis by just a few weeks . I retrospect it is almost as if Event 201 announced JJ of the controversies about to arise with the outbreak of the real epidemic in Wuhan China . Event 201 performed functions similar to those of the drills that frequently mimic the engineered scenarios animating false flag terror events but especially those of 9/11 . A major subject of the meeting highlighted the perceived need to VB communications during an epidemic . Levan Thiru of the Monetary Authority of Singapore went as far as to call for “ a step up on the part of governments to take action against NNP NNP . ” Thiru called for recriminatory litigation aimed at criminalizing “ bad actors . ” Cautioning against this kind of censorship , Skouras asked , Who is VBG to decide what constitutes “ JJ NN ” ? If fact checkers are to be employed , “ who will fact check the fact checkers ” ? Hasti Taghi , a NN executive with NBC Universal in NNP York , was especially outspoken in condemning the activities of “ NN theorists ” that have organized themselves to question the motives and methods of the complex of agencies involved in developing and disseminating NNS . She frequently condemned the role of “ NN theories ” in energizing public distrust of the role of pharmaceutical NNS and NN conglomerates in their interactions with NN . Tom Ingelsby of the Johns Hopkins Center for NNP Security injected an interesting twist into the discussion . He asked , “ How much NN of NN should there be ? By whom should NN of NN be exercised ? How can false NN be effectively challenged ? ” Ingelsby then added , “ What happens if the false NN is coming from NNS and governments ? ” This final question encapsulates a major problem for conscientious citizens trying to find their NN through the corruption and disinformation that often permeates our key institutions . Those that try to counter the problem that governments and corporations sometimes peddle false NN can pretty much expect to face accusations that they are “ NN theorists . ” Too often the calculations involved in deciding whom or what is credible ( or not ) depends primarily on simple arithmetic favouring the preponderance of wealth and power . Spiro Skouras gives careful consideration to the possibility that the NNP NNPS instigated the NNP - CD epidemic starting in Wuhan China . He notes the precedent set in 1945 on the atomic attacks by the US NN on the civilian populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . Skouras points out that there is proof that since the Second NNP War , the US NN has conducted at least 239 experiments , secretly deploying toxic chemical and biological agents against portions of its own population . On the history of US involvement in biological warfare VB here , here and here . Skouras highlights the window presented for a covert US bioweapon attack at the NNP Military Games in Wuhan China in the second half of October of 2019 . He notes that 300 US soldiers participated as athletes in the Wuhan Military Games together with a JJ contingent of American support personnel . The timing and the circumstances of the event were more or less ideal to open up a JJ pathogenic front in the US NN ’s informal “ hybrid war ” against China . On Feb. 15 at the Munich Security Conference , US Defence Secretary , Mark T. Esper , developed a highly critical characterization of Chinese wrongdoing in order to seemingly justify recriminatory actions . Esper asserted , “ China ’s growth over the NNS has been remarkable , but in JJ ways it is fuelled by theft , coercion , and exploitation of free market economies , private NNS , and colleges and universities … Huawei and 5G are today ’s poster NN for this nefarious activity . The US antagonism to Huawei ’s leadership in the design and worldwide dissemination of 5 G technology might well be a factor in the scandal generated by the Chinese connection to intertwined NN in microbiology at the level 4 labs in Winnipeg and Wuhan . RB in 2000 the notorious report entitled Rebuilding America ’s Defenses , a publication brought forward by the neoconservative Project for the NNP American Century ( PNAC ) , proposed that the US NN should refurbish and invoke its capacity to wage biological warfare . PNAC was the NN tank that anticipated the events of September 11 , 2001 by outlining a strategic scheme that MD only be realized by mobilizing American public opinion with “ a catalytic event IN a NNP Pearl Harbor . ” After 9/11 , the PNAC Team of related neoconservative activists and Zionist organizations pretty much took over the governance of the NNP NNPS along with the build up and deployment of its formidable war machine . PNAC called for the invocation of “ advanced forms of biological warfare that can ‘ target ’ specific genotypes . ” In this fashion “ biological warfare might be transformed into a politically useful tool . ” The relationship of this NN to internal disagreements within China has been put on full display in Steve Bannon ’s coverage of the crisis entitled War Room : NNP . A prominent member of US NNP Donald NNP ’s inner circle , Steve Bannon is often accompanied on the daily show by Chinese billionaire dissident , Miles Guo ( aka Guo Wengui , Miles Haoyun , Miles Kwok ) . Guo is an outspoken Chinese refugee . He is a persistent critic of virtually every facet of the policies and actions of the Chinese Communist Party . Guo regularly condemns those who dominate China ’s CD - party system , a system run by an elite who , he alleges , are corrupt , incompetent and inveterate liars . Guo regularly asserts that all of the Chinese NN ’s numbers on the NN , including death rates and infection rates , can probably be multiplied by 10X or RB 100X to VB closer to accuracy . [ On the 10X guestimate of mortality and infection VB this . ] Clearly Bannon and Guo MD VB to VB the emergency conditions created by the NN as a wedge of division , protest and regime NN within China . CD of the subjects they regularly raise , as do others who accuse the Chinese NN of systematic lying and deception , is that the crematoriums in Wuhan and nearby Chongqing are burning corpses of dead NNS at a rate far higher than official death figures . Some reports indicated that portable incinerators were being brought into the most infected core of the Wuhan NNP epidemic . It is troubling , to say the least , that some reports indicate dead NNS are being cremated far faster and at far higher rates than the Chinese NN and the NNP NNP Organization are reporting . Some reckoning with the apparent disparity between reported and actual deaths has led to widespread suspicions about what is actually VBG in the scenes of violent and angry exchanges between NNS in the Wuhan area . JJ of these videos show brutal confrontations between Chinese civilians and Chinese security police . The displays of desperation by some of those trying to escape apprehensions by uniformed officials seem sometimes to suggest the severity of a NN or death struggle . It is made to seem that those seeking to escape the grip of authorities are aware that their failure to do so might lead to a quick death and a quick exit by incineration . These reflections are , of course , speculative rather than definitive . Questions concerning who we are supposed to VB or not in this crisis are becoming ever more pressing and volatile . CD of the emerging themes in the discourse developed at War Room : NNP is the propensity of some of the core agencies of mainstream NN in the NNP NNPS to accept at face value the reports they receive from official NN outlets answering to the Chinese Communist Party . To Banning and Guo this pattern makes NN organizations IN the NNP York Times , The Washington Post , and CNN essentially propaganda extensions of the Chinese NN . The Chinese NNS themselves are clearly grappling in JJ ways with the problem of how to understand the NN and directives given them by the governing apparatus of the Chinese Communist Party . Clearly the Party initially failed the NNS by not intervening early and decisively enough after the JJ NNS of NN illness began to show up . The exit from Wuhan of almost five million NNS in prior to the Chinese Lunar NNP NNP celebrations had huge implications for spreading the contagion . As noted in the introduction , the death in Wuhan of Dr. Li Wenliang on 7 February has become a flash point for popular criticism of the Chinese Communist Party led by General Secretary Xi Jinping . Dr. Li wrote to members of his medical school alumnus group suggesting that some significant action should be taken in response to the appearance of NN - JJ NNS that suddenly afflicted his patients . For sending out this unauthorized communication , Dr. Li was summoned along with seven other supposed offenders to the Public Security Bureau . There he was warned by police to stop “ making false statements . ” He was ordered to cease and desist “ spreading rumors , ” and “ acting illegally to disturb JJ order . ” Dr. Li signed a form indicating he MD refrain from continuing to do what he had been accused of doing . The chastised professional returned to his medical practice . He took his own advice and began treating patients exhibiting signs of the JJ illness . He himself soon died from NNP - CD when it was still VBN as CD - nCoV . Is NNP ’s permanent deplatforming of the Zero Hedge web site a North American version of the police intervention in China with the goal of silencing Dr. Li ? Is the censorship of the Internet in the name of opposing “ NN theorists ” repeating the Chinese Communist Party ’s effort to silence Dr. Li ? Is Dr. Li to be appropriately understood as a Chinese version of a “ NN theorist ” ? How different was his NN for allegedly “ spreading rumours ” and “ acting illegally to disturb JJ order ” from the NN of those in the Occident who have been deplatformed , smeared and professionally defrocked for attempting to speak NN to power ? I have developed responses to these incursions based on hard - won experiences facing the propaganda blows of an especially powerful political lobby able to seize NN of the governing board of my NN . These professional lobbyists seek to discredit academic analysis of their own violations of law , ethics and civility by labelling critics of their zealotry as “ NN theorists ” or worse . More recently I have been grappling against a variation on this process in trying to counter the censorious attacks on the American Herald Tribune . These assaults on free expression and open debate began with the machinations of military hawks whose hit job instructions were passed along to the disinformation specialists at CNN and the Washington Post . No NN can say for sure where the Wuhan NNP epidemic is taking the NN . Wherever we are headed , however , we are leaving behind an era that can never be recreated . Whatever happened to originate the contagion , this crisis is forcing us to take stock of the framework of biological warfare as it has been developing in China , Russia , Israel and probably JJ other NNS . Nowhere , however , is biological warfare being more expansively and expensively developed and probably deployed than by the US Armed Forces . The death and destruction that humanity is presently experiencing should signal to us that it is NN to VB much more serious about inspecting military facilities and enforcing the terms of the Biological Warfare Convention of 1972 . It is , in fact , NN to VB much more serious about enforcing all aspects of international criminal law in balanced ways that transcend the biases of Victors ’ Justice . It is NN to throw off the weight of the pseudo - laws introduced after 9/11 through abhorrent tactics IN the inside - job military anthrax attack on Congress . Most certainly , it is NN to draw a clear distinction between NN in the field of public NN and NN in the development of lethal bioweapons . Better yet , we should work towards putting an end altogether to militarization through the massive expansion of the "" death sciences . "" The vile activities of fallen practitioners of the endangered NN sciences are , for starters , undermining the integrity of our besieged institutions of higher learning ."

The finance ministry VBD in a letter to parliament ’s budget committee dated June 15 that CureVac “ currently has a big capital requirement and plans a flotation on the Nasdaq in NNP York in July 2020 . ” European biotech firms prefer the Nasdaq because the U.S. capital market offers a critical mass of highly specialised biopharma investors , analysts say . German biotech firms BioNtech and Morphosys have recently sought U.S. listings . The ministry added in its letter that the decision to acquire a stake in CureVac had to be made quickly given legal requirements attached to the planned flotation , which is expected to take place in mid-July . Economy Minister Peter Altmaier on Monday confirmed an earlier Reuters report that Germany will take a stake in the unlisted biotech NN . The deal values the firm at 1.3 billion euros . That follows reported attempts by the U.S. NN to acquire CureVac or its assets in March , which stirred a backlash in Germany , with NN officials voicing support for keeping CureVac German . Altmaier VBD the NN wanted to strengthen the NN sciences and biotech sectors in Germany , and that it MD not have any influence over CureVac ’s business strategy . “ With this investment we aim to give CureVac financial security so that it can continue to work on NN production with the same commitment , ” Altmaier VBD a NN conference . A NN source VBD the measure reflected German concerns about relying too much on overseas suppliers for healthcare products and equipment . Reflecting the sensitivity surrounding ownership of the country ’s CD NN NN developers , CureVac and BioNTech , the NN gave itself JJ powers in NNP to veto hostile foreign takeover bids for healthcare firms . Dietmar Hopp , co-founder of software firm SAP and owner of a more than 80 % stake in CureVac , VBD none of the existing CureVac investors MD sell shares to the NN , and that their stakes MD be diluted by the deal on a pro-rata basis ."

We conducted a population - based retrospective cohort NN of all girls born in Denmark from 1997 to 2006 ( N = 328,779 ) , aged 12 – 15 . The outcome measure was HPV NN uptake ( JJ dose ) , as reported to the Danish national NN registry from 2009 to 2019 , when HPV NN was freely available to girls in primary care clinics in Denmark . Events that created 4 natural NN periods for NN were HPV NN reaching the uptake of other NNS in the national program ( 2009 ) , some negative NN coverage of HPV NN ( 2013 ) , extensive negative NN coverage ( 2015 ) , and a national NN NN about the NN ’s safety and effectiveness ( 2017–2019 ) . In the period with some negative NN coverage , HPV NN uptake fell to 83.6 % ( 95 % CI :78.0 % –89.7 % ) of baseline uptake . In the period with extensive negative NN coverage , uptake fell RB further to 49.6 % ( 95 % CI:44.5 % –55.2 % ) of baseline uptake . After the NN NN , HPV NN uptake recovered to its baseline level ( 109.2 % , 95 % CI:90.1 % –132.4 % ) due in part to catch - up doses . Despite the recovery , an estimated 26,000 fewer girls initiated the NN than if uptake had not declined .

It ’s similar to influenza and we should therefore reopen society and stop treating the situation IN the lethal menace it was initially thought to be . “ CD months ago we did n’t VB this so I ’m bringing it to light now , ” Erickson VBD Wednesday at a NN conference held at his Coffee Road urgent care .

That JJ NNS MD “ indicate there is a widespread ( NN - CD ) infection , similar to NN , ” Erickson VBD . And if we do n’t shutdown the country for NN , should we keep doing it for NN ? “ It ’s about looking at trends and saying we ’re not seeing what they ’ve been talking about for the past six to eight weeks , ” VBD Massihi , referring to predictions that up to 100,000 Americans MD die of the NN and hospitals MD become swamped with patients . “ We ’ve crippled the economy . There ’s a lot of domestic issues VBG on . Is JJ isolation warranted for the healthy ? ” Using the same calculation , Erickson estimates 12 percent of the population statewide , or some 4.7 million Californians , have already had NN - CD . With about 1,400 deaths so far in California , that puts the statewide death rate at about .03 percent , he VBD . “ Does that ( low death rate ) necessitate sheltering in place ? Does that necessitate shutting down medical systems ? Does that necessitate being out of work ? ” Erickson asked . Nationwide , about 42,000 NNS have died of NN as of Wednesday . Between 30,000 and 60,000 die of NN annually , Erickson VBD , citing CDC data . The secondary effects of the shutdown are considerable , too , he VBD .

Do not talk about whether NNS work or not , or whether or not they VBP NN , unless you ’re ready for a very heated debate . Although the link between NNS and NN is nothing JJ , to RB speak of it can VB you labeled as an “ anti-vaxxer ” or a NN fanatic of sorts by the sheeple ( brainwashed masses ) that VBP every NN the CDC recommends not only works , but is 100 % safe and 100 % effective 100 % of the NN . RB if some NNS work some of the NN , are they worth the NN NN ? That is the ultimate question , because CD statistic you MD not VB is that NNS who receive mercury - containing vaccinations ( listed as thimerosal usually ) are 27 times more likely to develop NN than those who do n’t VB those jabs . That comes from a recent NN based on the CDC ’s own data . Still VBP to keep it a hush - hush topic ? Pediatricians in America are not allowed to question NNS at all , nor are they allowed to recommend less than the CDC recommends , or they face the wrath of the AMA – the infamous American Medical Association – that finds a NN to shut down the “ contenders , ” sometimes RB taking away their license to practice medicine . Big question : MD the statistics of NN suddenly bottom out if mercury was removed from all NNS , including NN shots ? ( By the NN , the CDC lied when they VBD mercury has been removed from all NNS ) . Nary is a case of NN in the Amish communities of America For starters , NNS are not born with NN . It appears during infancy or childhood , and is brought on by an overload of neurotoxins either consumed , injected or ingested from JJ factors , or all of the above . In fact , the recent NN spectrum disorder ( ASD ) spike over the past CD decades in the USA directly coincides with the NN schedule increase , by quantity and frequency , enforced by the CDC . To understand why NN is next to non-existent for the Amish , consider that the Amish have been “ cut off ” from American scientific and medical “ progress ” for centuries , thus they ’ve had less exposure to the major factors that trigger NN , including the most likely proponent–vaccines . Take a little trip to the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country and try to tag yourself RB half a dozen Amish NNS with NN and you ’ll come up short . If statistics matched our national average , there MD be about 200 in the Amish community , but to date , there are only three , CD of which was adopted and brought over from China . VB figure . Another NN actually did VB vaccinated and developed NN shortly afterwards . VB figure again . Here are some universal and national statistics to consider . NN affects over 20 million NNS around the NN , and occurs in boys four to five times more often than girls . In the US , CD in every 68 NNS has some form of ASD , a 30 % increase from just 2012 . Why is that , you ’re asking yourself ? NNP NNPS kids VBP 50 inoculations before age seven , JJ that are combinations containing multiple NN strains , mercury , formaldehyde ( yes , embalming fluid for the dead ) , monosodium glutamate ( MSG ) and aluminum , just to name a few neurotoxins . NN shots contain the highest levels of mercury , up to 25,000 times what the EPA allows as a maximum in drinking NN and edible fish . Mercury is the second most poisonous element VBN to mankind . Due to religious beliefs , the Amish opt out of all NNS Fortunately for the Amish , they ’re RB opting out of three of the most controversial NNS on the market today : hepatitis B , HPV ( JJ papillomavirus ) and of course , the MMR ( NNS , mumps , rubella combo ) that was implicated in the CDC NN - NN - link and biggest medical cover - up in history , ever . Conflicting with CDC claims , the multi- dose version of hepatitis B still contains thimerosal ( 50 % mercury ) . The immature central nervous systems and the liver of Amish newborns are spared this volatile toxin thanks to their parent ’s religious beliefs . Amish NNS experience hardly any learning disabilities at all , in fact . Nor are the Amish experiencing typical US diseases IN cancer , heart NN and diabetes . This MD all be because they do n’t eat GMO , take chemical pharmaceuticals , or NNS . Surely , no NN run regulatory agency will ever run this comparison of Amish NN vs. non-Amish NN , but the reality speaks for itself . Still , the CDC refuses to regulate the NN industry and instead literally promotes toxic chemicals , dangerous heavy metal toxins , carcinogens and lethal “ preservatives ” IN mercury . It ’s all about lifestyle and natural NN these days , if you really VBP immunity that does n’t come with a boatload of permanent and debilitating “ side effects , ” IN NN spectrum disorder , Asperger ’s syndrome or liver cancer ."

The_DT article_NN was_VBD first_RB published_VBN on_IN November_NNP 9_CD ,_, 2011_CD ._.","It is CD of the most serious allegations that MD be made about a NN : manipulating patients ' histories to make money . So it is no wonder that the charges , levied by editors of the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) in January against medical researcher Andrew Wakefield , are still getting close scrutiny . Now an American whistleblower advocacy group has joined the fray over Wakefield , who in 1998 hypothesized a link , now scientifically disproven , between the NNS , mumps and rubella NN ( MMR ) and NN . On November 9 , David Lewis of the National Whistleblower 's Center in Washington DC published a letter in the BMJ ( http://bmj.com) arguing that Wakefield did not commit NN fraud . Lewis VBD Nature that he thinks the combination of public charges and a slow , secretive investigation has left the public not knowing whom to VB and is unfair to the accused researcher . "" [ The system ] throws NNS IN Andy into a no - NN 's - land , "" Lewis VBZ . Wakefield was the lead author of a 1998 paper in The Lancet ( A. J. Wakefield et al. Lancet 351 , 637–641 ; 1998 ) reporting on the case histories of 12 NNS who had received the MMR NN and developed NNS of NN or inflammatory bowel NN . The paper inflamed public fears about NNS , but it was retracted in 2010 after the UK General Medical Council ( GMC ) concluded that Wakefield had a charge of serious professional misconduct to answer , in part because it VBD that his team did not have proper ethical approval for tests performed on the NNS . Later in the NN , the GMC VBD him guilty of the misconduct charge and revoked his licence to practice as a NN . By then , more than 12 JJ - scale epidemiological studies had failed to find evidence of the hypothesized link ( J. S. Gerber and P. A. Offit Clin. Infect . Dis. 48 , 456–461 ; 2009 ) and the MMR NN is today regarded as safe . But was the paper merely mistaken , or a deliberate fraud ? Articles by medical journalist Brian Deer published in the BMJ in 2010 and 2011 accused Wakefield of reporting histories for the NNS that were not consistent with their records and their parents ' recollections , at a NN when Wakefield was RB being paid by lawyers intending to sue MMR manufacturers . Deer 's articles themselves did not allege fraud , but on their basis a BMJ editorial in January 2011 called the paper fraudulent . Wakefield has always denied allegations of manipulating data or having a financial motive in the Lancet paper , but no institution has yet ruled on the matter . In March , NNP College London ( UCL ) , which took over divisions of the Royal Free Hospital where Wakefield worked , VBD it had launched an investigation . In the meantime , Lewis , a microbiologist and former whistleblower who VBZ he was falsely accused of misconduct after alleging links between JJ illness and the spreading of sewage sludge , asked Wakefield for the chance to review his files . His claims are not likely to challenge the conclusion based on much other evidence that the NN does not trigger NN . But they MD complicate the debates about Wakefield 's integrity and the UCL investigation . The documents that Lewis reviewed include confidential forms describing biopsies from the guts of NNS . The forms were filled out by pathologists Andrew Anthony and Paul Dhillon , who worked with Wakefield at the Royal Free . These documents , Lewis VBZ , are relevant to Deer 's charge that records he obtained do not support Wakefield 's claims in the Lancet paper that the NNS had nonspecific colitis , a supposed element of an MMR - induced syndrome . On sheets for three of the NNS graded by Anthony , the handwritten word "" colitis "" appears , and Dhillon checked a box labelled "" non-specific "" on 10 forms . Anthony 's sheets are dated after the Lancet publication , whereas Dhillon 's are dated before . Lewis believes that the sheets show that Anthony and Dhillon were making good - faith diagnoses of colitis . Anthony , who has left UCL , MD not be reached by Nature , and Dhillon indicated that UCL had VBN him not to comment . ( Neither has been accused of manipulating data . ) Before publishing Lewis 's letter , the BMJ asked Ingvar Bjarnason , a gastroenterologist at King 's College Hospital , London , to review the materials . Bjarnason VBZ he does n't VB they are sufficient to support claims in the Lancet paper of a JJ NN process . He RB questions whether "" non-specific "" on the grading sheets refers to colitis , saying it MD refer to any kind of gut NNS . But he VBZ that the forms do n't clearly support charges that Wakefield deliberately misinterpreted the records . "" The data are subjective . It 's different to say it 's deliberate falsification , "" he VBZ . Deer notes that he never accused Wakefield of fraud over his interpretation of pathology records . But he VBZ that records read to him from the Royal Free pathology service clearly stated that the NNS 's gut biopsies were within normal limits , RB though they were reported in the Lancet paper as having enterocolitis . Fiona Godlee , the editor of the BMJ , VBZ that the journal 's conclusion of fraud was not based on the pathology but on a number of discrepancies between the NNS 's records and the claims in the Lancet paper . She VBZ she will be calling for a public inquiry into the matter , noting that it has been more than a NN since she RB informed UCL about concerns over Wakefield 's work . Wakefield denies charges of data manipulation . He VBZ that UCL has yet to officially request his response to any charges and he is n't convinced that the inquiry will give him a fair hearing . A UCL spokesman VBZ that the investigation will be "" thorough , fair and wide - ranging "" . But eight months after announcing its inquiry , the NN is still looking for a suitable external chairman . This article is reproduced with permission from the magazine Nature .

[_-LRB- 38_CD ]_-RRB-","Rinderpest ( RB cattle plague or steppe murrain ) was an infectious viral NN of cattle , domestic buffalo , and JJ other NNS of RB - toed ungulates , including buffaloes , JJ antelope , deer , giraffes , wildebeests , and warthogs . [ 2 ] The NN was characterized by fever , oral erosions , diarrhea , lymphoid necrosis , and high mortality . Death rates during outbreaks were usually extremely high , approaching 100 % in immunologically naïve populations . [ 3 ] Rinderpest was mainly transmitted by direct contact and by drinking contaminated NN , although it MD RB be transmitted by air . [ 4 ] After a JJ eradication NN since the mid-20th century , the last confirmed case of rinderpest was diagnosed in 2001 . [ 5 ] On 14 October 2010 , the NNP Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) announced that field activities in the decades - JJ , worldwide NN to eradicate the NN were ending , paving the NN for a formal declaration in June 2011 of the JJ eradication of rinderpest . [ 6 ] On 25 NNP 2011 , the NNP Organisation for Animal NNP announced the free status of the last eight NNS not yet recognized ( a total of 198 NNS were now free of the NN ) , officially declaring the eradication of the NN . [ 7 ] In June 2011 , the NNP Nations FAO confirmed the NN was eradicated , making rinderpest only the second NN in history to be fully wiped out ( outside laboratory stocks ) , following smallpox . [ 8 ] In June 2019 the UK destroyed its stocks of rinderpest NN , held at the Pirbright Institute in Surrey , which were most of the NN 's retained samples . This followed the compilation of a digital record of the NN 's genetic code , thereby obviating the need to store samples as a protective resource in case the NN re-emerges . Researchers at Pirbright and the NNP Nations expressed a hope that the other samples in laboratories around the NN will RB be destroyed , totally eradicating the NN from the NNP . [ 9 ] Rinderpest is believed to have originated in Asia , later spreading through the transport of cattle . [ 10 ] The term Rinderpest is a German word meaning "" cattle - plague "" . [ 2 ] [ 10 ] The rinderpest NN ( RPV ) was closely related to the NNS and canine distemper viruses . [ 11 ] The NNS NN possibly emerged from rinderpest as a zoonotic NN around 600 BC , a period that coincides with the rise of JJ JJ settlements . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Rinderpest NN ( RPV ) , a member of the genus Morbillivirus , is closely related to the NNS and canine distemper viruses . [ 11 ] IN other members of the Paramyxoviridae family , it produces enveloped virions , and is a negative - sense single - stranded RNA NN . The NN was particularly fragile and is quickly inactivated by heat , desiccation and sunlight . [ 14 ] NN NN evolved from the then - widespread rinderpest NN most probably between the 11th and 12th centuries . [ 13 ] The earliest likely origin is during the seventh century ; some linguistic evidence exists for this earlier origin . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Death rates during outbreaks were usually extremely high , approaching 100 % in immunologically naïve populations . [ 3 ] The NN was mainly spread by direct contact and by drinking contaminated NN , although it MD RB be transmitted by air . [ 4 ] Initial NNS include fever , loss of appetite , and nasal and eye discharges . Subsequently , irregular erosions appear in the mouth , the lining of the nose , and the genital tract . [ 3 ] Acute diarrhea , preceded by constipation , is RB a common feature . [ 4 ] Most animals die 6 - 12 days after the onset of these clinical signs . [ 3 ] The NN is believed to have originated in Asia , later spreading through the transport of cattle . [ 10 ] Other cattle epizootics are noted in ancient times : a cattle plague is thought to be CD of the 10 plagues of Egypt described in the Hebrew Bible . By around 3,000 BC , a cattle plague had reached Egypt , and rinderpest later spread throughout the remainder of Africa , following European colonization . [ 10 ] In the 4th century Roman writer Severus Sanctus Endelechius described rinderpest in his book , On the Deaths of Cattle . [ 17 ] Cattle plagues recurred throughout history , often accompanying wars and military campaigns . They hit Europe especially hard in the 18th century , with three JJ panzootics , which although varying in intensity and duration from region to region , took place in the periods of 1709 – 1720 , 1742 –1760 , and 1768 –1786 . [ 18 ] In the early 18th century , the NN was seen as similar to smallpox , due to its analogous NNS . The personal physician of the pope , Giovanni Maria Lancisi , recommended the destruction of all infected and exposed animals . This policy was not very popular and used only sparingly in the JJ part of the century . Later , it was used successfully in several NNS , although it was sometimes seen as too costly or drastic , and depended on a strong central authority to be effective ( which was notably lacking in the Dutch Republic ) . Because of these downsides , numerous attempts were made to inoculate animals against the NN . These attempts met with varying success , but the procedure was not widely used and was no longer practiced at all in 19th - century Western or Central Europe . Rinderpest was an immense problem , but inoculation was not a valid solution . In JJ NNS , it caused too JJ losses . RB more importantly , it perpetuated the circulation of the NN in the cattle population . The pioneers of inoculation did contribute significantly to knowledge about infectious diseases . Their experiments confirmed the concepts of those who saw infectious diseases as caused by specific agents , and were the JJ to recognize maternally derived immunity . [ 11 ] The JJ written report of rinderpest inoculation was published in a letter signed "" T.S. "" in the November 1754 issue of The Gentleman 's Magazine , [ 11 ] a widely read journal which RB supported the progress of smallpox inoculation . This letter reported that a Mr Dobsen had inoculated his cattle and had thus preserved 9 out of 10 of them , although this was retracted in the next issue , as it was apparently a Sir William St. Quintin who had done the inoculating ( this was done by placing bits of material previously dipped in morbid discharge into an incision made in the dewlap of the animal ) . These letters encouraged further application of inoculation in the fight against diseases . The JJ inoculation against NNS was made three NNS after their publication . [ 11 ] From early 1755 onwards , experiments were taking place in the Netherlands , as well , results of which were RB published in The Gentleman 's Magazine . As in England , the NN was seen as analogous with smallpox . While these experiments were reasonably successful , they did not have a significant impact : The total number of inoculations in England appears to have been very limited , and after 1780 , the English interest in inoculation disappeared almost entirely . [ 11 ] Almost all further experimentation was done in the Netherlands , northern Germany and Denmark . Further trials in the Netherlands Due to a very severe outbreak at the end of the 1760s , some of the best - VBN names in Dutch medicine became involved in the struggle against the NN . Several independent trials were begun , most notably by Pieter Camper in Groningen and Friesland . The results of his experiment in Friesland were encouraging , but they proved to be the exception ; testing by others in the provinces of Utrecht and Friesland obtained disastrous results . As a result , the Frisian authorities concluded in 1769 that the NN of rinderpest was NNP 's displeasure with the sinful behavior of the Frisian NNS , and proclaimed 15 November a day of fasting and prayer . Interest in inoculation declined sharply across the country . [ 11 ] In this NN of discouragement and scepticism , Geert Reinders , a farmer in the province of Groningen and a self - taught NN , decided to continue the experiments . He collaborated with Wijnold Munniks , who had supervised earlier trials . They tried different inoculation procedures and a variety of treatments to lighten the NNS , all of them without significant effect . Although they were not able to perfect the inoculation procedure , they did make some useful observations . [ 11 ] Reinders resumed his experiments in 1774 , concentrating on the inoculation of calves from cows that had recovered from rinderpest . He was probably the JJ to make practical use of maternally derived immunity . [ 11 ] The detailed results of his trials were published in 1776 and reprinted in 1777 . His inoculation procedure did not differ much from what had been used previously , except for the use of three separate inoculations at an early age . This produced far better results , and the publication of his work renewed interest in inoculation . For the period of 1777 to 1781 , 89 % of inoculated animals survived , compared to a 29 % survival rate after natural infection . [ 11 ] In the Netherlands , too , interest in rinderpest inoculation declined in the 1780s because the NN itself decreased in intensity . Apart from the Dutch Republic , the only other regions where inoculation was used to any significant level were northern Germany and Denmark . Experiments started in Mecklenburg during the epizootic of the late 1770s . "" Insurance NNS "" were created which provided inoculation in special "" institutes "" . Although these were private initiatives , they were created with full encouragement from the authorities . Though neighboring NNS followed this practice with interest , the practice never caught on outside Mecklenburg ; JJ were still opposed to inoculation . [ 11 ] While some experimentation occurred in other NNS ( most extensively in Denmark ) , in the majority of European NNS , the struggle against the NN was based on stamping it out . Sometimes this MD be done with minimal sacrifices ; at other times , it required slaughter at a massive scale . [ 11 ] A major outbreak affected the whole of the British Isles for three NNS after 1865 . [ CD ] Around the turn of the century , a plague struck in Southern Africa . [ CD ] The outbreak in the 1890s killed an estimated 80 to 90 % of all cattle in eastern and southern Africa , as well as in the Horn of Africa . Sir Arnold Theiler was instrumental in developing a NN that curbed the epizootic . The loss of animals caused famine which depopulated sub-Saharan Africa , allowing thornbush to colonise . This formed ideal habitat for tsetse fly , which carries sleeping sickness , and is unsuitable for livestock . [ 20 ] In his classic NN of the Nuer of southern Sudan , E. E. Evans - Pritchard suggested rinderpest might have affected the Nuer 's JJ organization before and during the 1930s . Since the Nuer were pastoralists , much of their livelihood was based on cattle husbandry , and bride - prices were paid in cattle ; prices MD have changed as a result of cattle depletion . Rinderpest might RB have increased dependence on horticulture among the Nuer . [ 21 ] A more recent rinderpest outbreak in Africa in 1982 –1984 resulted in an estimated US $ 2 billion in stock losses . [ 22 ] In 1917 – 18 , William Hutchins Boynton ( 1881 –1959 ) , the chief veterinary pathologist with the Philippine Bureau of Agriculture , developed an early NN for rinderpest , based on treated animal organ extracts . [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Walter Plowright worked on a NN for the RBOK strain of the rinderpest NN for about a decade , from 1956 to 1962 . [ 25 ] Plowright was awarded the NNP Food Prize in 1999 for developing a NN against a strain of rinderpest . In 1999 , the FAO predicted that with NN , rinderpest MD be eradicated by 2010 . [ 26 ] Widespread eradication efforts began in the early 20th century although , until the 1950s , they mostly took place on an individual country basis , using NN campaigns . In 1924 , the NNP Organisation for Animal NNP ( OIE ) was formed in response to rinderpest . [ 28 ] In 1950 , the Inter - African Bureau of Epizootic Diseases was formed , with the stated goal of eliminating rinderpest from Africa . [ 28 ] During the 1960s , a program called JP 15 attempted to vaccinate all cattle in participating NNS and , by 1979 , only CD of the NNS involved , Sudan , reported NNS of rinderpest . [ 28 ] In 1969 , an outbreak of the NN originated in Afghanistan , travelling westwards and promoting a mass NN plan , which by 1972 , had eliminated rinderpest in all areas of Asia except for Lebanon and India ; both NNS were the site of further occurrences of the NN in the 1980s . [ 28 ] During the 1980s , however , an outbreak of rinderpest from Sudan spread throughout Africa , killing millions of cattle , as well as wildlife . [ 28 ] In response , the Pan - African Rinderpest NNP was initiated in 1987 , using NN and surveillance to combat the NN . [ 28 ] By the 1990s , nearly all of Africa , with the exception of parts of Sudan and Somalia , was declared free of rinderpest . [ 28 ] Worldwide , the NNP Rinderpest Eradication Programme was initiated in 1994 , supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization , the OIE , and the International Atomic NNP Agency . [ 28 ] This program was successful in reducing rinderpest outbreaks to few and far between by the late 1990s . [ 28 ] The program is estimated to have saved affected farmers 58 million net euros . [ 29 ] The last confirmed case of rinderpest was reported in Kenya in 2001 . [ 30 ] Since then , while no NNS have been confirmed , the NN is believed to have been present in parts of Somalia past that date . [ 30 ] The final vaccinations were administered in 2006 , and the last surveillance operations took place in 2009 , failing to find any evidence of the NN . [ 30 ] In 2008 , NNS involved in rinderpest eradication efforts believed a good chance existed that rinderpest MD join smallpox as officially "" wiped off the face of the planet "" . [ 5 ] The FAO , which had been co-ordinating the JJ eradication program for the NN , announced in November 2009 that it expected the NN to be eradicated within 18 months . [ 31 ] In October 2010 , the FAO announced it was confident the NN has been eradicated . [ 6 ] The agency VBD that "" [ a ] s of mid 2010 , FAO is confident that the rinderpest NN has been eliminated from Europe , Asia , Middle East , Arabian Peninsula , and Africa , "" which were the locations where the NN had been last reported . [ 6 ] Eradication was confirmed by the NNP Organization for Animal NNP on 25 NNP 2011 . [ 7 ] On 28 June 2011 , FAO and its members NNS officially recognized JJ freedom from the deadly cattle NN . On this day , the FAO Conference , the highest NN of the UN agency , adopted a resolution declaring the eradication of rinderpest . The resolution RB called on the NN community to follow up by ensuring that samples of rinderpest viruses and NNS be kept under safe laboratory conditions and that rigorous standards for NN surveillance and reporting be applied . "" While we are celebrating CD of the greatest successes for FAO and its partners , I wish to remind you that this extraordinary achievement MD not have been possible without the joint efforts and strong commitments of governments , the main organizations in Africa , Asia and Europe , and without the continuous support of donors and international institutions "" , FAO Director - General Jacques Diouf commented . [ 32 ] The rinderpest eradication effort is estimated to have cost $ 5 billion . [ 33 ] Stocks of the rinderpest NN are still maintained by highly specialized laboratories . [ 30 ] In 2015 , FAO launched a NN calling for the destruction or sequestering of the remaining stocks of rinderpest NN in laboratories in 24 different NNS , citing risks of inadvertent or malicious release . [ 34 ] On 14 June 2019 the largest stock of the rinderpest NN was destroyed at the Pirbright Institute . [ 35 ] Rinderpest was CD of more than a dozen agents the NNP NNPS researched as potential biological weapons before terminating its biological weapons program . [ 36 ] Rinderpest is of concern as a biological weapon for the following reasons : • The NN has high rates of morbidity and mortality . • The NN is highly communicable and spreads rapidly once introduced into nonimmune herds . • Cattle herds are no longer immunized against RPV , so are susceptible to infection . [ 37 ] Rinderpest was RB considered as a biological weapon in the NNP Kingdom 's program during NNP War II . [ 38 ]"

Follow_VB him_PRP on_IN Twitter_NNP :_: @_IN MichaelJStern1_NNP","NN : I was in the stay - home - until - it 's - safe camp . But I just can't take it anymore . I ’m inherently lazy , so I hate working out . Given my druthers , I ’d spend my days eating NN cream bonbons and watching episodes of "" The Real Housewives . "" It ’s odd then , that the thing I miss most about the NN before NN and stay - at - home orders is VBG to the gym . For 40 NNS , the gym has been the thread that tied my physical being to my precarious sanity . Murder trials , surgery and personal tragedies have never kept me from the gym for more than CD weeks . So when rabid armed protesters recently stormed NN capitals demanding businesses reopen , the stupidest part of me hoped they MD succeed and end my months of gym exile . CD camps , largely paralleling America ’s CD political parties , have formed since the initial shock of NNP - CD ’s JJ rampage . My status as a die - hard Democrat placed me firmly in the “ stay at home until it ’s safe ” faction . And I ’ve not been shy about deriding the gun-toting mobs who insisted on standing shoulder to shoulder as they emptied their lungs at governors who are desperately trying to keep their citizens safe . Rand Paul , Andy Biggs : Anthony Fauci wants America closed until there 's nothing to reopen But as NN has worn on , I ’ve abandoned what I thought was the moral high ground in camp stay - at - home . JJ circumstances have convinced me that cities should reopen sooner rather than later . A NN looks more unlikely No NN but NNP Donald NNP ’s most cultish supporters believed his promise that this NN MD disappear with warm weather , or that we MD have a NN in three to four months . But at the outset of the federal guidelines that placed the NNP NNPS into suspended animation , JJ of us believed that the Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention , and endless NN resources , MD quickly find a NN — and a NN MD follow in due NN . More than CD months in , as the U.S. death toll barrels toward 100,000 , those assumptions have proved wrong , and the most basic precepts of viral epidemiology have been thrown into question . Usually , when NNS successfully fight a NN , they develop antibodies that protect against further infection . But NNS who have contracted and survived NNP - CD appear able to VB reinfected after winning the battle of their lives . The NNP NNP Organization announced last month that the antibodies that normally keep NNS safe from reinfection might not work against the NN . Since NNS function by stimulating antibody production , this revelation means the chance of an effective NN is far from guaranteed . A stark reality is being whispered by leading NN experts : the majority of the NN ’s population MD be exposed to the NN . When lockdowns began , most of us were willing to stay home and make the necessary sacrifices we believed guaranteed safe passage to the other side . Flights , weddings and dental appointments were rescheduled months down the road . But given that June is likely to be no different than September , and July no different than November , staying home wo n’t deliver us to the safety zone that prompted the shelter - in - place orders in the JJ place . This is n't a vacation : I 'm a survivor of domestic abuse . Quarantine with my father MD have been hell . It ’s true that if no NN ever leaves home , viral transmission will end . But this is not economically feasible . If the U.S. Treasury continues to print money with little to no manufacturing or labor to VB it up , the house of cards will eventually fall . I realize this statement has dropped me into traitor territory . But to the chorus from the left : No , reopening the country due to JJ considerations is not the same as saying money is more important than JJ NN . We face JJ realities every day , independent of the NN . Gun violence , drunken drivers , transmissible diseases and a panoply of other dangers MD all be brought to a screeching halt if we locked down indefinitely . But a NN of home confinement is not a NN in which most of us MD VB to live . Reopen — with eyes open to the risks With more NNS reopening over the next several weeks , NNS are likely to VB that local NN officials have determined things are safe . They ’re not . Texas was CD of the JJ NNS to reopen and recently saw its highest single day of JJ NNS since the NN began . While reopening is a necessity , it need not be reckless . Governors have a continuing duty to tailor reasonable restrictions to community conditions . The value in early shelter - in - place orders was that overwhelmed hospitals were given an opportunity to stabilize and avoid rationing NN . That ’s a justification worthy of respect , and we should prepare ourselves to accept the possibility of local rolling shutdowns due to filled hospital beds and occupied ventilators . For the past CD months I ’ve stayed safe by staying home , limiting my grocery shopping excursions to once a week . I ’d VB to visit family , but the thought of picking up NN at Trader Joe ’s and unintentionally killing my own parents is a Greek tragedy I ’m desperate to avoid . Moving into the third month of home isolation , the toll on each of us is different . Some face financial hardship . Some have seen their education thrown into limbo . For me , the longer I ’m home alone , the more my obsessive - compulsive disorder flares . I did n’t realize this until a phone call in which a friend asked whether I was staying safe . I explained that I had VBN a NN to test myself for NN : Loss of taste is CD of the JJ signs of infection , so I bought a 5 pound tub of jelly beans with 49 flavors . I eat several handfuls daily , CD bean at a NN . If I recognize each of the different flavors , I figure that I ’m safe . The dead silence on the line convinced me it was NN to book a Zoom therapy session . When the gravity of this NN made itself VBN , I expected my NN to protect me . But NNP has spent CD months blaming former NNP Barack Obama for a lack of personal protective equipment , peddling snake - oil cures and denying the shortage of NN - CD test kits . Sadly , the NN has shown that in order to make it through this crisis , we ’re VBG to have to fend for ourselves . As cities reopen , each of us will have hard choices to make . Choices about working from home , VBG to restaurants and visiting friends . I ’ve decided I ’ll VB the gym , but not restaurants or movie theaters . I ’ve RB decided that despite the discomfort , I ’ll wear a mask when I ’m in an indoor public NN — every NN . Staying out of harm ’s NN in the NN of NN promises to be a never - ending struggle to balance NN and reward . I hope I strike the JJ balance . I cringe at the idea of the progressive NNP crowd posting NN of my untimely demise as a cautionary tale . Michael J.

What other choices do we have , after all ? Put it this NN : Medical doctors VBP to college for eight NNS to learn how to juggle multiple medications while reading all of your NNS with fancy technological diagnostic tests , so should n’t you just shut the heck up and do what you ’re VBN , when you ’re VBN , without asking annoying , invasive questions that will most likely have boondoggles for answers ? How JJ NNS , after all , are not taking at least CD medication for anxiety , depression , inflammation , cholesterol , NN pressure , insomnia or NN ? Actually , there are plenty of us , because we VBP that “ Western ” medicine is n’t really medicine at all , but symptom - cover - up chemicals for deeper rooted problems that almost always stem from what we eat , drink and put on our bodies . Are you a “ drug abuser ” when you simply take the drugs prescribed to you by a medical NN ? Prescription drugs and their abuse in America date RB over a century . It all started with a concoction made with alcohol and opium called Laudanum . Yes , it was a NN “ remedy ” that doctors cross-prescribed for anxiety , sleeplessness , diarrhea or incessant coughing . Sound familiar ? It was quite addictive , as any watered - down heroin can be . Since women in the 1800s in America were prohibited from drinking at taverns and saloons , they simply went to the NN for NN for cramps or emotional problems , and voila ! Currently , about 35 million NNS abuse opioids worldwide . Unintentional overdoses have quadrupled since 2000 . Thanks to drugs IN oxycodone ( VB of Percocet ) and hydrocodone ( VB of Vicodin ) , the U.S. is the biggest consumer of deadly prescription painkillers . Did you VB that for the past 15 NNS , death certificates have listed opioid analgesic poisoning as the NN of death more often than cocaine or heroin ? Maybe you ’re just addicted to soda , though . Did you VB that a NN invented Coca Cola , but in the process jump - started his own morphine addiction when he added cocaine to this JJ drink and sold it at a pharmacy in Atlanta during the Civil War ? Ask your NN if soda and addictive , deadly , heroin - based prescription drugs are JJ for you . Are you a lab rat in the middle of an extended , insidious experiment being carried out by mad NNS and medical doctors ? Have you been VBN repeatedly that your NN problems are all “ genetic ? ” That ’s because doctors VBP you to VB that there ’s no cure , only chemical medication “ management . ” Have you been VBN you have a chemical imbalance in your brain ? That ’s because you ’re consuming chemicals regularly in your food and medicine , including in artificial sweeteners , tap NN , prescription medications and vaccinations . Most prescription drugs and inoculations are never tested for safety or efficacy , but rather are “ fast - tracked ” through FDA and CDC approval when pharma lobbyists pay regulators millions of dollars to just say “ yes . ” In most other instances , scientific “ testing ” is simply faked , flawed , altered and skewed to produce the results the pharma NNS need to make profits and spread more NN and disorder ( VB of the Swine NN and Zika NN NNS here ) . RB the yearly NN shot is CD huge , dangerous medical experiment that the CDC admits is often a failure . Maybe the reason you need prescription medications is because you ’re taking prescription medications . VB about that for a minute . Now do the math : If the NN shot is a hoax , and prescribed painkillers kill millions of NNS , then do you really VB your prescription medications , which are dished out by the same rogue doctors and NNS , are given with your “ good NN ” in mind ? Let ’s take an inside look at what all the American “ lab rats ” are experiencing . Chantix ( stop - smoking medication ) can VB suicidal thoughts . Nexium can VB inflammation of your kidneys and vitamin deficiencies . Vasotec can ruin your liver . Xanax is extremely addictive and abrupt stoppage can VB seizures . Plavix can VB you to cough up NN . Lipitor can break down your muscles , and can VB kidney failure and JJ - term nerve problems . Mirapex gives some NNS hallucinations and causes memory gaps . Ambien can VB impaired thinking . Risperdal can give you muscle tremors and uncontrolled movements ( drive recklessly much ? ) . Klonopin can make depression NNS worse , adding in suicidal thoughts and addiction . Actos and Avandia heighten the NN of heart attacks and bladder cancer . Hey America … picture yourself blindfolded , drugged up and running through a rigged maze with dangerous traps and no exits . This is the NN of NN shots , prescription medications , genetically modified food and fluoridated tap NN . It ’s NN to VB organic and natural for good . Talk to a naturopathic physician and question anything that has side effects worse than the condition you ’re considering treating . Then VB the power of natural remedies at NaturalPedia.com .

Look at this headline from USA Today “ 10,000 NNS of Ebola per Week . ” That ’s what the NNP NNP Organization VBZ we MD be getting in West Africa in a few months . So , why are there no flight restrictions out of West Africa ? Do the dimwits at the CDC not understand the concept of quarantine ? This is the number CD protocol of infectious NN , and JJ doctors and politicians are saying the same thing . Why not temporarily stop NNS from coming into the U.S. ? JJ other NNS are banning folks from West Africa , and that is exactly what NNS bordering the infected NNS did . Not the U.S. The CDC VBZ it ca n’t fight the outbreak with a travel ban . What ? You let more NNS who are possibly infected into the U.S. ? Is this too stupid to be stupid ? Now , there are some medical experts who are worried that Ebola MD mutate and become airborne . If that happens , expect panic in the general public around the globe . The stock market is having some wicked gyrations . Look at how the USA Today characterized the big rebound after it plunged 460 points . The headline reads “ Bargain Hunters Rescue Stocks From Gut Punch . ” Really ? Bargain hunters ? You mean the USA Today does n’t VB the NNP ’s Working Group on Financial Markets or the Plunge Protection Team is alive and well today ? Bargain hunters ? Please stop calling yourselves journalists , and just use the term “ NN spin doctors ” because that is what you are . Former Assistant Treasury Secretary Dr. Paul Craig Roberts VBD the NN intervened through the Plunge Protection Team and bought futures on the S&P , and that is the main reason the stock market rebounded . He will come on early next week for updates on multiple fronts . RB , in JJ NN , China is the JJ number CD economy in the NN , according to the International Monetary Fund . That ’s JJ . America is the number CD economy in the NN , and it MD never be number CD again . This is what happens when you offshore all your manufacturing to another country to save a few bucks . Germany did n’t do that with its manufacturing . How can the U.S. dollar remain the NN reserve currency when it ’s number CD ? How can the U.S. dollar be a reserve currency with unpayable debt that is growing by leaps and bounds every NN ? Short answer–it can’t . At some point , the dollar NN ends badly . The CD really hot spots for war in the NN , Ukraine and the Middle East , are not VBG well for the West . In Ukraine , there is a declared ceasefire , but that is debatable . What is not debatable is financial warfare being conducted between Russia and the U.S. and Europe . Russia is not happy . The leader of Russia , Vladimir Putin , is letting NNS VB sanctions , or what he calls “ blackmail , ” does not work and is a “ hostile ” act . He RB reminded everyone that Russia is a nuclear power and warned of creating instability . The Ukraine crisis is far from over . In the Middle East , the air war against the Islamic NNP is not VBG well and , shockingly , NNP Obama admitted it . RB though the bombing attacks continue , The Islamic NNP is still taking ground and is very close to Baghdad . Now , the Turks , as well as others , VBP not only to take out The Islamic NNP , but RB take out Assad in Syria at the same NN . Well , there is CD very big problem with that strategy and that is Russia is backing Assad and has warned of wider war if there are attempts to take him down . Finally , Harvey Organ ’s website of 15 NNS was taken down by court order . This happened a little more than a month after he made a bold prediction on USAWartchdog.com that the gold and silver price manipulation MD end before the end of 2014 . was it a coincidence his site was taken down ? Maybe , and then again , maybe not . Harvey Organ reports on inventories of gold and silver at COMEX and the LBMA . I have talked to Harvey by phone , and he still does not VB why his site was taken down . He VBD me he ’s asked Google for the court order , and it has not been produced . I will book him as soon as he is available . I VBP that when Mr. Organ came on USAWatchdog.com a little more than a month ago and VBD silver and gold manipulation is VBG to end this NN , he ’s probably hitting a nerve somewhere . His main contention is that gold and silver is in very short supply , and if you do n’t have the metal , you ca n’t VB the price .

Hannah , now 9 , recovered from her acute illness but she lost her words , her eye contact and , in a matter of months , began exhibiting the repetitive behaviors and JJ withdrawal that typify NN . "" Something happened after the NNS , "" VBZ her mom , Terry Poling , who is a registered nurse and an attorney . "" She just deteriorated and never came RB . "" Parents of kids IN Hannah have been fingering NNS  and , in particular , the mercury - based NN preservative thimerosal  as a NN of NN for over a decade , but researchers have repeatedly failed to find a link . What 's unique about Hannah 's case is that for the JJ NN federal authorities have conceded a connection between her autistic NNS and the NNS she received , though the connection is by no means simple . A panel of medical evaluators at the Department of NNP and NNP Services concluded that Hannah had been injured by NNS  and recommended that her family be compensated for the injuries . The panel VBD that Hannah had an underlying cellular disorder that was aggravated by the NNS , causing brain damage with features of NN spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . A special federal NN court has yet to award damages , but the recommendation , made public last week , is causing a sensation in the NN advocacy community . The Polings , who live in Athens , Ga. , were originally part of a group of nearly 5,000 families with autistic NNS seeking damages through the National NNP Injury Compensation Program . The other NNS remain before the court . The Poling case is RB causing deep concern among public NN officials , eager to reassure parents that NNS are safe and , indeed , hugely beneficial . In a public statement on Friday , Dr. Julie Gerberding , director of the Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention ( CDC ) , insisted that "" the NN has made absolutely no statement about indicating that NNS are the NN of NN , as this MD be a complete mischaracterization of any of the NN that we have at our disposal today . "" Gerberding and other NN authorities point out that the benefits of NNS far exceed their risks . They RB note that thimerosal was eliminated from routinely administered childhood NNS manufactured after 2001 , and yet NN rates have continued to climb . The current CDC estimate is that 1 of 150 American NNS has an NN spectrum disorder . Nonetheless , there 's no denying that the court 's decision to award damages to the Poling family puts a chink  a question mark  in what had been an unqualified defense of NN safety with regard to NN . If Hannah Poling had an underlying condition that made her vulnerable to being harmed by NNS , it stands to reason that other NNS might RB have such vulnerabilities . But there are circumstances that make Hannah 's case a bit unusual . For CD thing , she received an unusually JJ number of NNS in 2000 ( when thimerosal was still in use ) . Because of a series of ear infections , Hannah had fallen behind in the NN schedule , so in a single day she was given five inoculations covering a total of nine diseases : NNS , mumps , rubella , polio , varicella , diphtheria , pertussis , tetanus , and Haemophilus influenzae . "" That was just too JJ NNS , "" VBZ Terry Poling . "" I did n't find out for several months that they had thimerosal , which contains mercury , a powerful neurotoxin . Had I VBN , I never MD have allowed it to be injected into my NN . "" Another confounding issue in Hannah 's case is the finding that she suffers from a mitochondrial disorder  a dysfunction in basic cell metabolism . Mitochondria serve as power generators for each cell in the NN , converting food and oxygen into NN . There are a wide range of these disorders , causing NNS that vary widely but can include muscle weakness , cardiac or liver NN , diabetes , developmental delays and susceptibility to infection . In Hannah 's case , the NN court determined that the underlying dysfunction of her mitochondria put her at an increased NN of injury from NNS . That decision , however , comes as a surprise to experts on mitochondrial disorders . In response to the Poling case , the NNP Mitochondrial NNP Foundation has released a statement saying , "" There are no scientific studies documenting that childhood vaccinations VBP mitochondrial diseases or worsen mitochondrial NN NNS . "" Dr. John Shoffner , the Atlanta - based neurologist who identified Hannah Poling 's mitochondrial disorder , is "" genuinely puzzled "" by the court 's judgment . Shoffner , who has been studying and treating these disorders for 20 NNS , VBZ it 's impossible to say whether Hannah 's mitochondrial disorder was , in fact , a pre-existing condition that set the stage for her NN ( as the NN contends ) or if it developed along with her NN . A specialist in mitochondrial disorders , he is investigating the relationship between NN and these disorders and plans to present a paper on the topic at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in April . "" In some subset of NNS with ASD  a small group of patients , I VBP  mitochondrial dysfunction is an important part of their NN . But it 's too early to say whether it gets the ball rolling or if it comes about after the ball got rolling . "" Experts on NN spectrum disorders VBP that most NNS are caused by a combination of genetic vulnerabilities and JJ factors . There MD be hundreds of roads to NN , involving numerous combinations of genes and external factors . MD thimerosal or some other aspect of NNS be CD of these factors ? "" It 's always possible that there 's a small subset of kids that have this vulnerability , "" VBZ Dr. Isaac Pessah , director of the Center for NNP 's NNP NNP and NNP Prevention at the NNP of California , Davis . Pessah 's lab is looking at dozens of possible JJ factors , including pesticides , plastics and flame - retardants . "" This is a very emotional debate , "" he VBZ , "" and we need more NN directed at these questions . "" It 's difficult to draw any clear lessons from the case of Hannah Poling , other than the dire need for more NN . CD plausible conclusion is that pediatricians should avoid giving small NNS a JJ number of NNS at once , RB if they are thimerosal - free . Young NNS have an immature immune system that 's ill - equipped to handle an overload , VBZ Dr. Judy Van de NNP , an immunologist who works with Pessah at U.C. Davis . "" Some NNS , such as those aimed at viral infections , are designed to ramp up the immune system at warp speed , "" she VBZ . "" They are designed to mimic the infection . So you can imagine getting nine at CD NN , how sick you MD be . "" In addition , she VBZ , there 's some evidence , that NNS who develop NN MD have immune systems that are particularly slow to mature . Van de NNP worries that current NN schedules MD be overly aggressive for some NNS . She suggests that parents who are concerned about NN safety ask their pediatricians to give fewer at a NN . And , she adds , do n't vaccinate a NN when he or she is ill . Hannah Poling is now a third grader in public school , working CD - on - CD with teachers in a special - ed classroom . She continues to struggle with the effects of NN and RB has seizures . Her parents are hoping her case will spur additional NN into the causes of NN , including the roles of NNS and mitochondrial disorders . "" My daughter 's case raises more questions than it answers , "" concedes her father , Dr. Jon Poling , a neurologist who RB has a Ph.D. in biophysics . Poling believes in the importance of vaccinating NNS : "" NNS are CD of the most important advances in the history of medicine , "" he VBZ , "" but NNS need to VB there is a NN to every medicine . There MD be a small percentage of NNS who are susceptible to injury . "" He and his wife MD VB to VB thimerosal eliminated from NN NNS , which continue to be given to NNS and pregnant women , a fact that , he thinks , MD be CD reason NN rates have n't declined . And he urges pediatricians to take a hard look at the schedule on which NNS are given . "" I VBP we need a grassroots movement among pediatricians to be more conservative , and not give so JJ shots at once . """

The French results are based on only 36 NNS and focus on the patients ’ viral load , or the amount of NN in the NN . Indeed , the only patients to die or to be sent to intensive care in the French NN had taken hydroxychloroquine . “ We do n’t have data from randomised , controlled trials telling us how chloroquine worked in real NNS , ” VBZ Annie Luetkemeyer , an HIV and infectious diseases specialist at the NNP of California , San Francisco , Department of Medicine . Self - medication with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin MD RB come with hazards , as the CD drugs might stress the heart and increase the NN of arrhythmia . On Monday , Donald NNP vowed to send NNP York thousands of doses of the combo for an FDA trial , not RB after an Arizona hospital reported CD of its patients died after self - medicating on chloroquine phosphate , a form of the compound used to clean aquarium tanks . Nigerian NN officials reported CD NNS of chloroquine overdoses over the weekend . “ The last thing that we VBP RB now is to inundate emergency departments with patients who VBP they VBD a vague and risky solution that MD potentially jeopardise their NN , ” Daniel Brooks , the medical director of the Banner Poison and Drug NNP Centre in Phoenix , VBZ in a statement . ACE inhibitors , drugs that are used widely to treat high NN pressure , have RB come under fire during the NN - CD crisis , with some reports suggesting that patients should stop taking these medications if they develop NNS . In a series of letters in the British Medical Journal , Nature Reviews Cardiology , and The Lancet Respiratory Medicine , researchers raised questions over whether ACE inhibitors might VB establish NN infections in NNS ’s lungs . The concern stems from the fact that NNP and the JJ NN enter cells by latching on to a protein called angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 , or ACE2 for short . The protein abounds on the surfaces of cells in the heart and lungs , where it helps regulate a hormone that affects NN pressure constriction . CD consequence of ACE inhibitors is that they MD prompt cells to make more ACE2 . A 2005 NN VBD evidence of such an increase in mice , and a 2015 NN in humans VBD increased ACE2 levels in the urine of patients who were taking a medication related to ACE inhibitors . But there is no current evidence that ACE inhibitors worsen NN - CD outcomes in humans , according to the American Heart Association , the European Society of Cardiology ’s Council on Hypertension , and a March 20 review published in the European Heart Journal . Doctors ’ overriding advice is that if you ’ve been prescribed a medication , continue taking it until VBN otherwise by your medical provider . “ We should neither be starting nor stopping these medications until we have much more NN , ” Luetkemeyer VBZ . NNS with high NN pressure and heart NN do appear to be at higher NN for NN - CD , but that probably has more to do with the underlying ailments themselves . What ’s more , ACE inhibitors MD have anti-inflammatory properties , which MD VB the lungs of NN - CD patients better cope with the infection . ( Learn how these underlying conditions make NN more severe . ) “ That MD be a key NN , to compare NNS with high NN pressure plus or minus these drugs , to VB if there ’s any difference , ” Perlman VBZ . “ But it ’d be very hard to do , and probably very hard to ethically justify . ” “ By all means , if you ’re having emergency breathing NNS or something ’s troublesome , we do VB you to seek emergency attention , ” VBZ Purvi Parikh , an allergy and infectious NN specialist at NYU Langone in NNP York City . If you choose to seek NN at a local hospital , here ’s CD example of what you might expect . At the Inova NNP System ’s flagship hospital in Fairfax , Virginia , staff have set up an outdoor tent to separate NNS reporting respiratory ailments from those with other illnesses . The CD groups are processed in different parts of the waiting room , separated by at least six NNS of NN . Due to a shortage of tests , doctors in JJ U.S. hospitals say that if NNS arrive with mild NNS , these patients are VBN to assume they have NN - CD and are encouraged to self - quarantine to prevent overloading hospital beds . In the UK , NHS 111 advises those displaying mild NNS remain at home , and has set up an online symptom - checker to self - asses how severe any infection MD be so the patient can make a decision on whether to seek further NN . For those arriving with serious NNS such as difficulty breathing , NN care workers start by focusing on the patient ’s oxygen levels , NN pressure , and the amount of fluid in their lungs — all in an effort to keep their condition stable . They RB try to manage fever , which can VB discomfort and lead to cell damage . The most severe NNS of NN - CD require putting a patient on a mechanical ventilator — a device that cycles air in and out of a person ’s lungs — for more than a week at a NN . That ’s why NN officials are so concerned about a coming ventilator shortage . The Society of Critical Care Medicine VBZ that up to 200,000 ventilators exist in U.S. hospitals , but some are older and might not effectively treat NN - CD . Meanwhile , CD rough estimate suggests that more than 900,000 Americans MD VB NN - CD and need a ventilator . In the U.K. various engineering firms including car , aircraft and vacuum cleaner manufacturers have switched production to meet the demand for ventilators ."

Their latest work is inspired by a NN they published in 2015 , which built a model that systematically estimated the performance of traveller screening programs during outbreaks of NN , MERS , influenza , and Ebola . As in this earlier work , the JJ model for NNP - CD includes basic factors IN the failure rate for thermometer guns or how easily the NN moves between NNS . But it RB accounts for more subtle variables , IN how JJ NNS might transmit the NN before their NNS arise , or how often NNS accurately report their NNS on screening questionnaires distributed at airport customs . “ It 's pretty evident from past outbreaks that NNS are n't always honest about risky exposures , ” Lloyd - Smith VBZ . “ Based on the past data we had , it looked IN CD in four passengers accurately and honestly reported the risky exposures they had . ” Compute all these variables , and their model estimates that enhanced screening is at best catching 50 percent of infected air travellers and at worst just 20 percent , primarily because NN - CD NNS are so latent . “ Based on what we understand about this NN , something on the order of half of NNS are fundamentally not detectable [ during screening ] , ” Lloyd - Smith VBZ . While the results are currently being peer - reviewed at the journal eLife , they mirror what preliminary results from a separate NN group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predict for air traveller screening with NNP - CD . “ We 'd probably only catch about 45 percent of infected travelers using exit screening , ” VBZ Samuel Clifford , an epidemiologist at the London School ’s Center for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases . “ Out of the remaining 55 percent of NNS who are n't caught , we can catch a few more on entry . You 've got 42 percent of the NNS [ with NNP - CD ] still making it into the country . ” While such models can offer an indication of what might be happening , you can VB these dynamics play out in real - NN by setting your sights on CD nation : Singapore . Singapore boasts CD of the highest - regarded NN care systems on the planet , thanks to public funding , low costs for NN , and an abundance of doctors , nurses , and other NN professionals . This workforce pays off during an outbreak , because it means that Singapore can catch NNS the moment patients arrive on their shores . “ Singapore had such a remarkable record during NNP with following NNS , and it seems to have a high ratio of detection this NN around , ” VBZ Marc Lipsitch , an epidemiologist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public NNP . He thinks tracking the NN - CD situation in Singapore can VB gauge how the outbreak might evolve in other NNS , especially in areas with developed NN care systems or places that receive high volumes of travelers from China . The NNP NNPS fits both aspects of this billing , given that it receives as JJ travellers from China as Singapore , roughly three million a NN . Based on preliminary modelling in Lipsitch ’s lab , Singapore ranked RB out of 191 NNS in NN surveillance during the JJ weeks of NNP - CD . His team suspects that Singapore 's methods are exceptionally sensitive to JJ NNS , and can thus serve as a standard of comparison against other NN systems . By using Singapore as a standard bearer for NN - CD detection , his team can then estimate how JJ NNS are likely VBG unnoticed in other NNS . Relative to Singapore , other nations with a high capacity for NN surveillance — IN the U.S. , Japan , Thailand , and afflicted NNS in Europe — MD only be catching 38 percent of travel - related NNS , based on Lipsitch ’s model . That ’s due in part to Singapore officials ’ dogged efforts toward border screening , but RB because the island country is dense . Its 5.6 million NNS are packed into an area on par with Charlotte , North Carolina , which makes it easier to trace the contacts connected to individual NNS . “ If there are [ NNP - CD ] carriers coming into the NNP NNPS that are n’t detected , which is likely the case , Singapore MD probably have an equivalent number , ” VBZ Scott Gottlieb , a former U.S. FDA commissioner and resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who thinks Lipsitch ’s NN is on the JJ track . “ But they'd be unmasked sooner in Singapore because it 's a smaller , more densely populated nation . ” For this reason , Gottlieb VBZ that Singapore offers an omen for major cities in the U.S. , rather than the nation as a whole . “ They 're a good bellwether for what happens when an outbreak steps into a very sophisticated NN care system and advanced economy in a dense environment , ” he VBZ . There are caveats to Lipsitch ’s models , including that mild or asymptomatic NNS of NN - CD MD not be accounted for . Plus , these models are yet to be published in a peer - reviewed journal , though the process is under NN . But their results mirror what others are predicting about the leaky nature of travel restrictions and what they might mean for preparedness in at - NN NNS in places IN Africa . The model predicts that up to 89 percent of imported NNS might be VBG undetected in NNS with a low capacity for NN surveillance . And undetected NNS passing across borders are such a concern because they represent the JJ step to local transmission , the stage where an outbreak becomes disconnected from importation and begins to perpetuate freely in a region . On Thursday , researchers in Singapore , including CD from the ministry of NN , reported eight of the nation ’s 84 NNS are yet to be linked to any clear exposure . Meanwhile , the NNP - CD tally doubled in South Korea to 204 , due to an outbreak at a church in Daegu tied to a 61 - NN - old woman VBN only as “ Patient 31 . ” But the source of her infection is currently unknown . “ Although the total number of NNS outside China remains relatively small , we ’re concerned about the number of NNS with no clear epidemiological link , ” VBD Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , director - general of the NNP NNP Organisation , VBD at a Friday press briefing . “ Apart from the Diamond Princess cruise ship , the Republic of Korea now has the most NNS outside of China . We ’re working closely with the NN to fully understand the transmission dynamics that led to this increase . ” More than 80 JJ NNS reported Friday are tied to Patient 31 , and Korea ’s Centres for NNP NNP & Prevention described this incident in Korea ’s fourth largest city as a super - spreader event . “ There is a real NN , ” Lipsitch VBZ , “ that there 's ongoing transmission in other NNS , which if it remains undetected is VBG to result in more and more NNS . ”"

Hepatitis B is less common in the UK than other parts of the NN , but certain groups are at an increased NN . This includes NNS originally from high - NN NNS , NNS who inject drugs , and NNS who have unprotected NN with multiple sexual partners . A hepatitis B NN is available for NNS at high NN of the condition . JJ NNS with hepatitis B will not experience any NNS and MD fight off the NN without realising they had it . If NNS do develop , they tend to happen 2 or 3 months after exposure to the hepatitis B NN . • yellowing of the NN and eyes ( jaundice ) These NNS will usually pass within 1 to 3 months ( acute hepatitis B ) , although occasionally the infection can last for 6 months or more ( chronic hepatitis B ) .

If you have had the infection for more than 6 months ( chronic hepatitis B ) , you MD be offered NN with medicines that can keep the NN under NN and reduce the NN of liver damage . Chronic hepatitis B often requires JJ - term or lifelong NN and regular monitoring to check for any further liver problems . The hepatitis B NN is VBN in the NN and bodily fluids , such as semen and vaginal fluids , of an infected person . • from a mother to her newborn baby , particularly in NNS where the infection is common ( read more about hepatitis B in pregnancy ) • within families ( NN to NN ) in NNS where the infection is common • by injecting drugs and sharing needles and other drug equipment , such as spoons and filters • by having NN with an infected person without using a condom • by having a tattoo , NN piercing , or medical or dental NN in an unhygienic environment with unsterilised equipment • by sharing toothbrushes or razors contaminated with infected NN Hepatitis B is not spread by kissing , holding hands , hugging , coughing , sneezing or sharing crockery and utensils .

Natural NNS infection is VBN to VB acute encephalopathy / encephalitis . Although the IOM VBD the evidence to be “ insufficient ” to determine whether NNS NN can VB acute encephalopathy , there is some evidence of clustering of encephalopathy / encephalitis NNS whose onset is 8 to 10 days following NNS - containing immunization , based on an analysis of 48 VICP claims . 111 Only rarely are biological markers demonstrated to support a genetic , metabolic , or NN NN . In only CD VICP case was cerebrospinal fluid NN antibody , a biological marker for NN causation , VBN in a previously healthy 2 - NN - old girl who received the JJ dose of MMR and varicella NN . JJ - onset seizures following MMR NN was alleged in some claims . Nearly all were febrile seizures occurring in the 7 - to 14 - day NN frame during which fever MD accompany replication of NN NN . The NNS that fell within the VIT onset interval were usually recommended for entitlement by VICP staff . Most such claims were adjudicated before residual seizure disorder was removed from the VIT . Another common diagnosis was thrombocytopenic purpura , a VIT condition with prescribed onset of 7 to 35 days following NN . Most involved NNS with documented thrombocytopenia within this interval . In some NNS , additional episodes of decreased platelets occurred in the ensuing months or NNS . JJ , however , showed normalization of their platelet count before the 6 months of continued effects required by the NCVIA . Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis ( SSPE ) claims have RB been identified , more than half of them deaths . Early hearings resulted in a few being compensated because of the initial lack of administrative resources to defend claims . Subsequent testimony by experts in infectious NN persuaded the court of the lack of any data supporting a causal connection , noting the tremendous decrease in SSPE incidence since licensure of the NN decades ago . Since then , claims of SSPE - related injury or death have been dismissed . Claims alleging injury from rubella NN comprise 2 % of claims overall . Most are filed on behalf of adult women who received NN in the postpartum period or for employment . In the majority of NNS , acute and chronic arthritis or arthralgia developed 7 to 90 days ( median , 14 days ) after rubella immunization . Neuropathy and fibromyalgia were the other diagnoses . A previous inventory of 113 nonacute arthritis claims filed starting in 1988 showed 28 % with chronic arthropathy or other generalized complaints similar to those of chronic fatigue syndrome and 30 % with a variety of non–vaccine - related conditions . Although 13 % to 15 % of susceptible ( serology - negative ) women MD experience transient arthritis after the currently used rubella NN , with a higher percentage ( up to 40 % ) reporting some type of musculoskeletal complaint , it is less clear what role , if any , the NN has in causing recurrent or chronic arthropathy ( ie , arthralgia or arthritis ) . 78,79 Based on the 1991 IOM finding that chronic arthritis MD be caused by rubella NN , a special master held a hearing to determine criteria necessary for proof of causation . Following the special master 's publication of these guidelines , the VICP added chronic arthritis to the VIT in the 1995 final rule45 and incorporated several of the court 's criteria in the 1997 final rule . 94 The main difference between the criteria adopted by the VICP and those adopted by the court has been the latter 's willingness to compensate arthralgia , a subjective symptom that is difficult to assess , unlike observable signs of arthritis . Adjudications to date have resulted in 70 claims being compensated and 123 being dismissed . Additional NN published since the IOM report , including retrospective case reviews and a prospective double - blind NN , has produced mixed results . If rubella NN does VB chronic arthropathy , it MD seem that the incidence is rare . 112–114"

Politicians are repeating the mantra that a NN NN is the exit strategy . But getting there is neither simple nor RB guaranteed . "" A NN is not a given , "" VBD David Heymann , a professor of infectious NN epidemiology and distinguished fellow at Chatham House . There are hundreds of NN candidates in development , but the vast majority will fail . Assuming CD is successful , it MD take NNS to manufacture billions of doses for the entire globe . With this in mind , “ waiting for a NN is a poor , poor exit strategy , "" Heymann argued . He and other experts say that the idea that a NN is the only NN out MD provide NNS with false hope and ignore other vital public NN measures already at our disposal . For example , politicians MD give equal attention to a NN - CD cure or to more comprehensive testing methods — or promote simple public NN measures IN hand washing . “ Instead of VBG for silver bullets and moonshots , the focus should be on doing the hard slog of public NN , "" VBD Devi Sridhar , chair of JJ public NN at the NNP of Edinburgh . Here are four public NN measures that experts say need to be put in place . But spoiler alert : Most require up - front investment and have their own hurdles . CD of the clear ways out is knowing who has the NN . Testing was key at the start of the NN , but as NNS emerge from lockdown , "" it acquires an RB more important position , "" VBD John Middleton , NN of the Association of Schools of Public NNP in the European Region . As the number of infected NNS dwindles , pinpointing who has the NN makes it possible to put up a "" cordon sanitaire "" and focus on the ill and those they 've been in contact with . But it 's RB vital in another NN , he noted , by understanding factors IN the geographical extent of the spread . "" You can look at surveillance and population studies to VB how far the NN has spread , and what level of immunity there might be in the country , "" Middleton added . "" That MD influence how safe it is to [ scale RB ] lockdown . "" There are , as always , obstacles to surmount . RB , ramping up capacity has been a problem for JJ NNS . In the U.S. , cuts to public NN budgets mean that there 's a lack of qualified personnel and machinery . Testing capacity there had to be built from scratch , Middleton explained . In the U.K. , shortages of reagents meant that testing was reserved for those who were ill in the hospital . Inaccurate testing is another problem . With popular nasal swab tests , false negatives rates can be as high as three in 10 . For more precise NN tests , the opposite is a bigger problem — false positives leading NNS to VB they 've contracted the NN and are immune , thus skewing statistics , Middleton explained . "" Politicians have seen it as a beauty contest — how JJ tests are done — without a proper understanding about the results , "" Middleton VBD . The good NN is that the technology is improving , and better , more rapid tests are coming along , he added . Austrian geneticist Hans Lehrach , of the Max Planck Institute , thinks it 's NN for a completely JJ NN of testing . "" This requires a different approach to testing as landing a NN on the moon required a different approach than hot air balloons , "" Lehrach VBD . Lehrach 's idea is that governments MD test everyone in a given country or in the EU for five consecutive weeks by genetic sequencing . If NNS did this , they MD effectively eliminate the NN in that area . It MD require citizens ' and governments ' buy - in — literally . But so far , governments have been slow to take on this JJ testing approach . "" Whatever we do will not be for free , "" Lehrach VBD . But he argues that this approach MD eliminate the NN from the targeted area and allow NNS to VB RB to restaurants and work knowing "" that everybody they meet is free of the NN . "" If there 's CD immediate priority that governments should invest in for the short term , it 's contact tracing , argues Clare Wenham , assistant professor of JJ NN policy at the London School of Economics . “ The NNS that are able to resume normal NN — Hong Kong , Taiwan , South Korea — they ... have the infrastructure to be able to do really granular and effective contact tracing , ” Wenham VBD . This requires an effective application and staff who can “ join the dots . ” “ When CD person gets infected , [ the tracers ] can notify who they ’ve been in contact with , and reach the NNS that were n’t on the app for whatever reason . A bank of staff that can do that last mile , ” she VBD . Numerous European NNS are trying to do this already , including the U.K. and Germany . But they 're running into CD problems . JJ of these apps are n't interoperable across borders , so their effectiveness at fighting major public NN problems is not VBN . And JJ NNS are afraid of signing up . “ For a lot of Europeans , it ’s not a natural thing to have the NN tracking everything on your phone and your movements , ” VBD Wenham . Assuring NNS that their data is safe , and not being used for any other purposes — for example to be sold to third parties — is key here , Wenham added . "" This is a dataset that MD be rich for selling , "" she VBD . "" You need to make sure that you have that data security . "" CD major advantage that therapies have over NNS is that they 're easier to test — and therefore faster to bring to market . David Salisbury , an associate fellow at Chatham House and former director of immunization at the U.K. 's Department of NNP , explained that this comes down to the comparative ease of setting up clinical studies for drugs . "" You test [ an ] antiviral in NNS who 've got the NN , and you hope to VB that those that you treat with the antiviral VB better and survive better than those who have a placebo or an alternative NN , "" Salisbury explained . "" With a NN , you 've got to show that it stops NNS actually getting infected , "" he VBD . "" So it has to be administered in a place where the NN is circulating , and administered in extremely JJ doses . "" This means NN developers are constantly racing to roll out clinical trials in places where the NN is still on the rise . Recently , the NNP of Oxford and AstraZeneca launched a JJ wing of its phase 3 clinical trial in Brazil because that 's where the "" epidemiological curve is still rising . "" But regardless of whether and when a NN is developed , therapies are necessary , say experts . “ We need drugs before we VBP a NN , "" VBD Nick Cammack , NNP - CD therapeutics accelerator lead at the Wellcome Trust . "" We need drugs while we have a NN ... and we need drugs after we VBP a NN , because RB for conditions that we currently have NNS for you still have breakthrough NNS . "" The JJ line of defense is coming from repurposed drugs , he noted at a webinar organized by the Wellcome Trust last week . These are medicines already developed to fight other diseases and are now being tested to VB if they VBP patients . The CD medicines that have been in the spotlight — remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine — fit into this category . However , evidence of their efficacy is , at best , spotty . Remdesivir , an antiviral developed to fight Ebola by drugmaker Gilead , has shown it can moderately shorten the duration of the NN . Malaria drug hydroxychloroquine promised some early hope but has since failed to pay off , with a major British trial declaring negative results . In the medium term , antibodies can RB be applied as a therapy , Cammack noted . Plasma from NNS who have already recovered from the NN carries antibodies against NN - CD . If it ’s injected into patients that are currently sick , it can give the immune system a boost to VB fight the NN . The problem : You ’re limited by the amount of recovered patients you can gather plasma from . An alternative approach is monoclonal antibodies , which are designed and can be mass - produced in a lab . U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly has brought its monoclonal antibodies to phase 1 trial together with AbCellera , and expects results at the end of June . "" In the next six to nine months we will VB if monoclonal antibodies that are specific for NN - CD show safety and efficacy , "" Cammack VBD . "" There 's much excitement around them as potential treatments . "" Specific antiviral medicines to target NN - CD — likely to be small molecule drugs — are further away and require a number of trials . Beyond the measures noted above , experts argue , policymakers need to keep up basic public NN work that has become routine since lockdowns started : Washing hands , wearing a mask and keeping distance . "" If [ NNS ] are underpinning activities in a country by protecting themselves by JJ distancing , that 's already a major step forward , "" Heymann VBD . CD of the most important tools for politicians is clear communication , especially considering that the public needs to trust that these measures — testing , contact tracing , drugs and a NN , if it 's VBN — are safe . Trudie Lang , professor of JJ NN NN at the NNP of Oxford , VBD that this was a lesson RB learned from Ebola that 's being learned again now : Public NN measures are only as effective as the amount of trust the public has in them to work . “ What messages to use ? How to gain public trust ? ” Lang VBD , RB at the Wellcome webinar . "" In the absence of drugs and NNS , these are things that we are left with . "" And RB if we VBP a NN or an effective NN , CD of the clearest messages from public NN officials might be that the NN is here to stay . “ This NN is not VBG to VB away . Period , ” the NNP NNP Organization ’s David Nabarro VBD the BBC . “ We do n’t have a NN and we do n’t VB we ’re VBG to develop CD … so we ’ve all got to learn to live with this NN . ” This article is part of POLITICO ’s premium policy service : Pro NNP Care .

"" From left to NN : ' View ' co-hosts Whoopi Goldberg and Meghan McCain during Monday 's taping . The panel was discussing the Democrats ' latest $ 3 trillion NN - CD relief bill proposal , which passed in the House of Representatives but is expected to be turned away in the Republican - controlled Senate . Some Republican lawmakers denounced the relief bill as a "" liberal wish list "" last week — a comparison McCain , 35 , repeated on Monday before Goldberg , 64 , sent the show to a commercial break as McCain was still talking . "" How are we VBG to tax NNS if there 's no economy ? "" McCain asked as Goldberg VBD viewers the show MD be RB RB and ushered a commercial break . McCain is the youngest and only conservative voice represented on The View 's daily panel and often clashes with her co-hosts , who largely lean left on political and JJ issues . The panels ' latest argument came when co-hosts Sunny Hostin and Joy Behar joined Goldberg in calling for the Democrats ' sweeping relief bill to pass in the Senate , with both hosts drawing on their own personal financial struggles in the past in forming their view on the issue . Hostin and Behar both VBD they VBP to VB the federal NN give more aid to struggling Americans , though Behar admitted the $ 3 trillion that Democrats requested MD be too much but that Congress is supposed to negotiate . Behar , 77 , argued the relief bill MD VB American workers and families who can't VB to work and are relying on unemployment insurance . Hostin , 51 , then escalated the discussion when she suggested Republican lawmakers have more cynical reasons to turn the relief package away . “ What this is really about is the ' haves ' not wanting the ' have nots ' to survive this and that is really , really serious , "" Hostin VBD . "" We have the money . We just do n't seem to have the money to save these NNS . This is what that 's about . "" "" That is just ridiculous , "" McCain VBD as Goldberg tried to speak at the same NN . "" It 's a Democrat wish list . "" "" Hold on , I just VBP to — just let me finish ... let me finish my point , "" Goldberg interjected before sending the show to a commercial break as McCain continued speaking . When the show came RB , the panel moved on to talk about the growing public feud between NNP Donald NNP and former NNP Barack Obama , who appeared to criticize NNP 's handling of the NN during his virtual 2020 commencement speech over the weekend . The rivalry between the CD political figures is representative of the broader partisanship between those in the Republican and Democratic political parties , including the hosts of The View . “ I VBP at a certain point , we have to start talking to each other in the middle , "" McCain VBD .

The NN produced protective immunity in 70 per cent of volunteers who took part in a NN conducted at St George 's Hospital , London . More NN is needed to establish the best dosing regime and the optimum NN schedule , and it is likely to take NNS for the product to become available commercially . However , the drug uses innovative technology that MD herald a JJ generation of needle - less NNS : Microscience is now working on oral prophylactics against typhoid , hepatitis B and RB anthrax . Another oral NN against ETEC MD be licensed in Britain in a matter of weeks . Dukoral is already available in several NNS , including Switzerland and Sweden . ETEC bacteria and cholera produce similar toxins which trigger the outpouring of fluid into the intestine that is characteristic of severe diarrhoea . Because Dukoral gives protection against this toxin , it has been licensed in some NNS as a NN for both cholera and ETEC diarrhoea . It has not yet been announced whether Dukoral will be licensed for both when it is launched in Britain . The old injection against cholera has not been available for NNS - and it gave negligible protection . Advances in medicine have made cholera a much less fearsome NN , but a JJ NN will be welcome , especially among intrepid travellers and those living and working in the developing NN . Travellers ' diarrhoea is a more widespread problem , afflicting at least CD - fifths of all international travellers . Although ETEC is the most common NN , it typically accounts for only about CD - fifths of NNS . The rest are caused by a vast range of bacteria , viruses and parasites - and there is no prospect of developing an effective NN against all of them . • Dr Dawood is a specialist in travel medicine at the Fleet Street Clinic , London ( 020 7353 5678 ) ."

Sign_VB up_RP for_IN The_DT Conversation_NNP ’s_POS newsletter_NN ._. ]_-RRB-","Early morning on NNP 18 , Moderna , a biotechnology NN , revealed the preliminary findings for the much anticipated phase I trial of an mRNA NN - CD NN . The NN sent Moderna ’s stock soaring by more than 20 % and helped fuel a rally on Wall Street . Although there was an enthusiastic response to the NN , the purpose of all phase I trials is primarily to demonstrate safety and tolerability . While the early results are tantalizingly positive , what Moderna has not revealed is raising some doubts . I am a data scientist and was , until last month , working on NN development for Zika and dengue fever . Since the beginning of the NN - CD NN , I have spearheaded building a consortium of more than 100 cancer centers to collect data about cancer patients who have been infected with NN - CD . The purpose of the NNP - CD and Cancer Consortium is to rapidly collect and disseminate NN about this especially vulnerable population . Having a background in NN development , I VBD Moderna ’s press release lacking some key details . A NN imitates the infection to give the immune system a preview of the NN . NN became a public NN tool after Edward Jenner showed in 1796 that inoculation with the less virulent cowpox MD prevent smallpox . After his son ’s death from smallpox , Benjamin Franklin regretted his decision not to inoculate his son against it . Today NNS are widely credited for the prevention and eradication of JJ of once feared deadly diseases . NNS prepare the immune system by generating NN - fighting proteins called antibodies , which seek out and attack if the real infectious NN ever shows up . Traditional NNS against viruses are either weakened versions of the whole NN that are unable to VB NN ; or they are made from signature viral proteins called antigens , that then spark an immune response . An antigen in the JJ NN NNP - CoV - 2 is the crown - JJ spike ( S ) protein through which the NN latches to the lung and respiratory cells . However , developing NNS based on the viral proteins is a slow process because of the difficulties in producing pure proteins at medical standards in JJ quantities . But now NNS have developed a different type of NN : mRNA NNS . Rather than giving a person a protein NN , researchers are giving them mRNA , which is the biological code that the cells read and translate to make their own proteins . So , instead of the traditional viral protein NNS , an mRNA NN provides a synthetic copy of mRNA - encoding individual proteins from the NN , which the host NN uses to produce the viral protein itself . As with other NNS , the presence of the protein kicks off the NN ’s immune system to fight the NN . A big advantage of mRNA NNS is that NNS can skip the laboratory production of proteins by directly injecting the molecular instructions to make the protein into the JJ NN itself . Massachusetts - based Moderna Inc. has fast - tracked development and testing of an experimental NN - CD mRNA NN called mRNA - 1273 . Its collaborators at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) were already working on experimental Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) NNS , which targeted a closely related NN spike protein . So as soon as the genetic sequence of NNP - CoV - 2 became available , Moderna and its collaborators at NIAID got a head start . With up to US $ 483 million in federal funds to speed development of a NN NN , Moderna began testing the 2019 - nCoV NN ( mRNA - 1273 ) on Feb. 25 , 2020 . The phase 1 NN of the investigational NN , led by the NIAID , part of the National Institutes of NNP ( NIH ) , was designed to assess the safety , tolerability and ability to induce an immune response at three dose levels – 25 , 100 or 250 micrograms . On NNP 18 , Moderna announced the interim phase 1 data . mRNA -1273 was generally safe and well tolerated , except for minor redness and swelling at higher doses . No volunteers faced any NN - threatening events during the six weeks of NN . The mRNA - 1273 produced antibodies which MD bind the target spike protein at each of the injected doses , in all 45 volunteers ( ages 18 to 55 ) . The production of the binding antibodies response from mRNA - 1273 injection was similar to the NN VBN in patients who have recovered from previous NN - CoV - 2 infection . It is important to highlight , though , that RB among the survivors of NNP - CD , the antibody response is highly variable . What has not been revealed Unconventional for a scientific NN , data was given from only eight of the 45 volunteers — four each from the 25 and 100 microgram doses , who developed neutralizing antibodies . Neutralizing antibodies are essential for an effective JJ - lasting NN because they not only bind to the NN , but they block an infection . The age of the eight volunteers is not VBN . That is important NN because NNP - CD is far more deadly for older patients . It ’s important to VB if this immune response was limited to the younger participants . RB , the neutralizing antibody response in the remaining 37 volunteers was not disclosed . So it is impossible to VB whether the mRNA - 1273 was ineffective in them , or whether the results were not available at this point . The phase 2 trial for mRNA - 1273 has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration . In this trial each subject will receive CD vaccinations – prime and booster – of either a placebo , a 50 microgram , or a 250 microgram dose given 28 days apart . The amended choice for a higher dose suggests that the lowest 25 microgram dose of phase 1 was not very effective . Moderna expects phase 3 trial to start in July and anticipates to produce 1 billion doses of the NN soon thereafter . [ VB facts about NN and the latest NN .

But a thoroughly - researched report recently published by Arjun Walia over at Activist Post reveals that there are at least 22 published scientific studies that show a link between NNS and NN and that there are JJ more out there with similar findings . Much of the original controversy stems from Dr. Andrew Wakefield ’s NN RB in the late 1990s , which exposed gastrointestinal inflammation as an obvious side effect of NN with the combination NNS , mumps and rubella ( MMR ) NN . Dr. Wakefield obviously struck a major nerve with his NN , which was quickly torn apart by the establishment and maliciously paraded around as being fraudulent , RB though his groundbreaking findings have repeatedly been validated and replicated by JJ other studies . A 2002 NN published in the Journal of Biomedical Sciences , for instance , observed a causal effect between the MMR NN and NN , particularly with regards to the NNS portion of the NN . The researchers from Utah NNP NNP concluded that MMR is capable of inducing an abnormal NN infection in some NNS , which in turn can lead to neurological problems that fall under the umbrella of ASD . Another NN published in the journal Entropy in 2012 observed a strong correlation between the MMR NN and NN , except in this case aluminum was the culprit . According to an abstract of this NN , NNS that contain aluminum are particularly toxic to NNS , who end up later being diagnosed with ASD , as they have insufficient serum levels of both sulfate and glutathione . The aluminum VBN in some NNS , in other words , appears to be a primary aggravator of ASD NNS . “ Regardless of the MMR NN and NN debate , there are still a number of studies that link NNS to a possible NN connection , ” writes Walia . “ [ M]ultiple courts worldwide have ruled in favor of NNS causing NN , brain damage and other complications that include the MMR NN , ” he adds , noting that JJ other side effects besides NN have been observed in relation to NNS . Heavy metals , adjuvants , preservatives and other NN additives all linked to causing NN Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Walia ’s extensive NN on the subject is the fact that there appear to be multiple ingredients in NNS responsible for triggering NN . Besides toxic metals IN aluminum and mercury , NNS RB contain adjuvant materials , preservatives and other additives that have all been identified as culprits in the studies listed in his article . Realistically , each of these additives is most likely toxic both in isolation and in combination with the other additives , eliciting compounded toxicity depending on the mixture . “ Oxidative stress , brain inflammation and microgliosis have been much documented in association with toxic exposures including various heavy metals , ” admits CD NN out of Massachusetts General Hospital , which verified that autistic individuals possess a unique type of neuroinflammation in their brain tissue that points to NN damage . Several of the studies listed in Walia ’s report RB pin thimerosal , a toxic mercury derivative that is still being added to multidose vials of NN NN , as a trigger in causing the types of brain damage linked to NN . CD particular NN out of the NNP of Texas NNP NNP Center VBD that for every 1,000 pounds of mercury released into the environment , there is a consequential 61 percent increase in NN rates . With thimerosal - containing NN shots now being administered to NNS as young as six months old , it is highly plausible that ASD - associated brain damage is still occurring as a result of mercury being injected directly into muscle tissue .

Inject a tiny bit of the live NN into your NN so you can build antibodies and thus immunity against the “ real deal ” later . If that ’s all there was to it , it MD actually work . Then there ’s the fear mongering that ’s thoroughly “ inflamed ” and propagated by the press , pharma , and the medical doctors of quack Western medicine . This is where the real money is made . If you VBP NNS you MD die ! If you VBP polio you ’ll surely be paralyzed for NN ! If you VBP Zika , your baby ’s head will be shrunken and deformed ! Yet , what if you VBD out today that the worst odds you or your NNS have of being infected with NN , disorder , and deformity exist in getting injected repeatedly with neurotoxins , genetically modified bacteria , live experimental strains of multiple viruses and pesticides ? Consider this : not CD single NN ever produced that is recommended by the CDC today has ever been proven safe or effective . Why ? They do n’t have to prove it . All they have to do is scare the living hell out of everyone using propaganda , and it ’s worked for 75 NNS . Presenting the 7 most dangerous NNS injected into humans without any proof of safety or efficacy # 1. Gardasil HPV – Forget for a moment the fact that JJ girls who VBP the HPV NN beginning at age 9 for a sexually transmitted NN ( diseases they do n’t have ) VB into immediate anaphylactic shock and some into comas and die , and let ’s just talk about the insane boatload of chemicals the manufacturers put in this concoction that belong nowhere in medicine , ever , especially that which is injected directly into muscle tissue and that which can penetrate the NN / brain barrier . Plus , remember to triple the amounts of these carcinogenic , dangerous , ludicrous chemical ingredients of Gardasil , because there are 3 of these toxic jabs required . RB we have sodium borate at 35 mcg . RB VBN as “ borax , ” this is the main poisonous ingredient in boric acid that ’s used to kill cockroaches . Is your little girl a cockroach ? Is it coincidence that the side effects listed and reported with the Gardasil NN match those of sodium borate poisoning ? No , it ’s not a coincidence . Did you VB that anything imported into the European Union that contains borax must carry a warning label stating , “ MD damage fertility ” and “ MD damage the unborn NN . ” This is what America “ recommends ” for preteen and teenage girls who are just reaching the age of fertility . Unbelievable ! Then , Gardasil HPV contains aluminum at 225mcg , which causes nerve cell death and helps the NN chemicals enter the brain . Let ’s not forget that Gardasil HPV contains polysorbate 80 at 50 mcg . Polysorbate 80 is used as an emulsifier in foods , but when injected into animals ( such as humans ) , causes rapid , unnatural growth of reproductive organs , causing sterility . This is population NN through NNS , just as Bill Gates once VBD at a TED conference MD be ideal for reducing the NN ’s population by a few billion . Polysorbate 80 is what causes the anaphylactic shock and RB causes cancer and birth defects , while we ’re on that topic . Sorry , but there ’s not enough NN to talk about the sodium chloride at nearly 10mcg . # 2 . Anthrax NN ( biothrax ) – The dreaded anthrax jab contains aluminum hydroxide , formaldehyde ( yes , embalming fluid for the dead ) , and benzethonium chloride . In 2009 , a NN published in the Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry stated that aluminum hydroxide MD be the primary NN of Gulf War Syndrome . Aluminum hydroxide causes apoptosis of motor neurons , leading to dementia . VB figure . Thousands of US soldiers given the mandatory anthrax jab are still sick or have died . It was never approved by the FDA , yet any soldier refusing it got dishonorably discharged , fines , and possible prison NN . NNP NNP ’s executive order 13139 gave the DoD permission to experiment on the US military with the highly dangerous anthrax concoction . # 3 . MMR II – Under Appendix B , listed on the CDC website , you can find the ingredients for the MMR ( MMR - II ) , the combination NNS that contain recombinant JJ albumin , sorbitol , hydrolized gelatin , chick ( egg ) embryo cell culture , JJ diploid lung fibroblasts , and fetal bovine serum , among other certain preservatives and chemical adjuvants . In the “ ProQuad ” version , or MMRV ( w/ vericella for chicken pox ) , they ’ve added monosodium L - glutamate , neomycin , and MRC - 5 cells . And although NNS is a respiratory NN accompanied by an uncomfortable rash and fever illness that anyone with a normal immune system will likely survive , the NN scares the public into getting jabbed with neurotoxins . Sorbitol is a synthetic sweetener which metabolizes very slowly and aggravates IBS and gastrointestinal issues . Fetal bovine cow serum is extracted from cow NN and when injected causes connective tissue disorders , arthritis and lupus ; RB shortness of breath , low NN pressure , chest NN and NN reactions . Sodium chloride raises NN pressure and inhibits muscle contraction and growth . JJ albumin is the protein portion of bloodfrom pooled JJ venous plasma and when injected causes fever , chills , hives , rash , headache , nausea , breathing difficulty , and rapid heart rate . Injecting “ pooled NN ” can result in a loss of NN cell mass and VB immunodeficiency NN infection , or contain SV40 , AIDS , cancer or Hepatitis B from drug addicts . Still VBP that MMR NN ? Did n’t VB so . # 4 . Swine NN – This loaded nightmare hoax NN contains inactivated H1N1 NN propagated in embryonated chicken eggs . The multi - dose vials contain over 24mcg of mercury per .5 ml dose ! The jab RB contains antibiotics polymyxin and neomycin that annihilate good gut bacteria , making the immune system highly vulnerable to infection . Add in some fluid from chicken eggs and you have CD of the most experimental jabs ever created and a hoax perpetuated by WHO , GSK and the CDC to profit in the billions . # 5. Polio – This psycho-jab contains inactivated monkey kidney cells , newborn calf serum , embalming fluid , antibiotics , and bovine albumin . Salk did n’t invent the cure for polio–he invented JJ strains of it by haphazardly combining several . VB the facts ! # 6 . Influenza NN ( a.k.a. the NN shot ) – Specifically , the “ FluLaval ” NN shot contains 25 mcg of mercury in CD jab . The EPA safety limit for drinking NN ? Just 5 mcg . Do the math , then consider that shots bypass digestion , breathing , and NN filters . Common NN jabs RB contain formaldehyde and polysorbate 80 . # 7 . RotaTeq for Rotavirus – Three oral doses of this Merck - made horror NN cost about $ 200 and are mandated for about four million infants every NN . Rotavirus NN contains 5 live strains , plus some fetal bovine serum and porcine circovirus–a volatile and dangerous NN that infects pigs . Side effects of RotaTeq ? Difficulty breathing , vomiting and ear infection , followed by bloody stool . Then the intestines VBP blocked and twisted ( VBN as intussusception ) which can be deadly and requires surgery on infant ’s intestines . Be sure and call your NN RB away if your NN dies from RotaTeq ."

A fisherman VBD the NN of Dr. James Jeffery Bradstreet in the Rocky Broad River in Chimney Rock , North Carolina , last Friday afternoon . “ Bradstreet had a gunshot wound to the chest , which appeared to be self inflicted , according to deputies , ” reported WHNS . In a press release , the Rutherford County Sheriff ’s Office announced , “ Divers from the Henderson County Rescue Squad responded to the scene and recovered a handgun from the river . ” An investigation into the death is ongoing , and the results of an autopsy are RB reportedly forthcoming . Dr. Bradstreet ran a private practice in Buford , Georgia , which focused on “ treating NNS with NN Spectrum Disorder , PPD , and related neurological and developmental disorders . ” Among various remedies , Dr. Bradstreet ’s Wellness Center reportedly carried out “ mercury toxicity ” treatments , believing the heavy metal to be a leading factor in the development of childhood NN . Dr. Bradstreet undertook the effort to pinpoint the NN of the NN after his own NN developed the ailment following routine NN . “ NNP taught me more about medicine than medical school did , ” the NN once stated at a conference , according to the Epoch Times ’ Jake Crosby . In addition to treating patients , Bradstreet has RB offered expert testimony in federal court on behalf of NN - injured families and was founder and NN of the International NNP Development Resource Center , which at CD NN employed the much - scorned NN expert Dr. Andrew Wakefield as “ NN director . ” The circumstances surrounding Bradstreet ’s death are made all the more curious by a recent multi-agency raid led by the FDA on his offices . “ The FDA has yet to reveal why agents searched the office of the NN , reportedly a former pastor who has been controversial for well over a decade , ” reported the Gwinnett Daily Post . JJ NN pages dedicated to Bradstreet ’s memory are filled with comments from families who say the deceased NN impacted their lives for the better . “ Dr. Bradstreet was my son ’s NN after my son was diagnosed with NN . He worked miracles , ” CD NNP user NNS . “ At 16 , my son is now looking at a normal NN thanks to him . I thank him every day . ” “ I will forever be grateful and thankful for Dr. Bradstreet recovering my son… from NN , ” another person writes . “ Treatments have changed my son ’s NN so that he can grow up and live a normal healthy NN . Dr. Bradstreet will be missed greatly ! ” A GoFundMe page has RB been set up by CD of Bradstreet ’s family members seeking “ To find the answers to the JJ questions leading up to the death of Dr Bradstreet , including an exhaustive investigation into the possibility of foul play . ” Despite his family requesting the public refrain from speculation , JJ are nevertheless concluding the NN ’s death to be part of a NN . “ Self - inflicted ? In the chest ? I ’m not buying this , ” CD person in the WHNS comments thread NNS . “ This was a NN who had access to pharmaceuticals of all kinds . This was a religious NN with a thriving medical practice . Sorry , but this stinks of murder and cover -up . ” Another commentor had a more definitive conjecture : “ He did NOT kill himself ! He was murdered for who he was speaking against , what he knew , and what he was doing about it . He was brilliant kind compassionate NN with amazing abilities to heal . He was taken . Stopped . Silenced . Why MD a NN who had access to pharmaceuticals and MD die peacefully shoot himself in the chest ???? And throw himself in a river ?? THIS IS OBVIOUS ! MURDER !! ” Funeral arrangements for Dr. Bradstreet are still pending at the Cecil M. Burton funeral home in Shelby , Georgia . This article was posted : Friday , June 26 , 2015 at 3:05 pm"

Writers and reporters have spent countless hours cataloging the damage and ruined lives created by the crazed decisions of elected and appointed leaders , and through all of it seeking to make sense and convince them to VB their policy . Now we understand why they behave IN demon possessed brutes and perverts . That is exactly what they are ! High level policy has required that only those with such fallibilities can be trusted to execute the agenda decided upon almost seventy NNS ago . The article quoted below gives a quite reasoned explanation for these policies as “ hard choices ” gone wrong . The author of the article is an advocate of population NN , but not in the dishonest and deceitful NN it has been approached since WW2 . Read it and understand that the poisoning of the land NN and air is no accident , but the intended route to JJ population NN . …. the international security prerogative of population NN , pursued since its inception in 1945 by adulterating the basic elements of NN with chemical and biological toxins to subvert fertility and longevity and by undermining the family structure through psychosocial and JJ means to delay the formation of families and keep them small … From : The Subversion of Medicine and Public NNP by International Security Prerogatives Far from protecting the population , the leadership has assumed that it is disposable , and treated us all with a disdain incomprehensible , except when we understand their depopulation agenda . This page is intended as a guide to VB our members discover the NN and act on it . For this reason we are focused on the NN issues personal choices can affect . Within the context of the above quote are so JJ deliberate policies that damage the innocent we can scarcely begin to list them here . In fact most of them are beyond the ability of individuals to VB or deal with , being the result of a sequence of high level decisions directed by the depopulation agenda . NN issues can be acted upon , so here we have provided five pages of links relating to things you can avoid or do to live more securely . • Quantum Leap MMS Documentary and Movement this is a simple discovery by a NN who wanted to VB a friend deal with malaria while on an expedition in the Amazon . Instead slowing the infection it totally cured it within a few days . From that experience he went on to test it on JJ other problems with incredible results . Now the FDA and big Pharma are working to crush this NN … too late ! It ’s out of the bag and running wild all over the NN . Read the article and discover that it attacks all of diseases as well as malaria . CD thing you MD notice is that the reason it is being subverted is not identified by the MMS proponents , but the reason is the depopulation agenda . It ’s JJ policy from the UN down the local NN clinic .

Let_VB ’s_PRP hope_VB they_PRP get_VBP it_PRP right_JJ ._. ”_''","Pharma is looking to reset its image with NN - CD NNS and treatments , but landmines loom — with pricing likely the biggest . The halo from pharma ’s rapid response in NN and discovery — and the hope that a NN or effective treatments will allow the NN to return to some sort of normal — has propelled the industry ’s reputation at an all - NN high . Forty percent of Americans say their opinion of the pharma industry has turned positive during the NN - CD NN , according to The Harris Poll . However , pricing lurks just beyond the lab . Just this week in NN , CD well - VBN pundit posited in a Forbes column that the industry ’s reputation hinges on the pricing of Gilead Sciences ' NN remdesivir , while another touted Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla ’s promise to not price its NN too high in part because “ NNS will not forget if you do that . ” Yet in the same Axios article , Bourla is quoted as saying the NN represents a “ huge commercial opportunity ” for Pfizer . Industry experts say it ’s a safe bet that other pharma NNS are wrangling with the same contradictory issues . RELATED : Can the price be JJ ? With the NN watching , Gilead faces a no-win decision on remdesivir Stewart Lyman , a biotech and pharma consultant , VBD while NNS and researchers will be satisfied with just the discovery of a NN , executives at the top of pharma NNS will likely VB more . “ I suspect they will be very sensitive to not gouging because there will be both political pressure and pressure from the other NNS to not do that this CD NN , ” VBD Lyman , who is RB a former scientist at Immunex , now owned by Amgen . “ ( But ) they ’re VBG to be looking for something in return , "" he added . "" Exactly how that gets sorted out , I do n’t VB , but PRP can easily imagine a quid pro quo of some type where they say ‘ yes , we ’re giving this to you for cheap but let ’s not have any price controls ’ ” on other drugs in the future . The Harris Poll Managing Director Rob Jekielek VBD pricing alone , whether Gilead 's remdesivir or NNS , has n't been the key to pharma 's improved reputation during the NN . Pricing has been a top three issue in Harris Poll surveys since March , but NNS and treatments — especially NNS — are what 's driving the hockey - stick spike in the industry 's reputation . The bigger pricing issue will be affordability once NNS and treatments are released , he VBD , although as he pointed out , that will be a more integrated issue across industries including pharma , insurance , pharmacy benefit managers and others . "" If a NN or NN exists , but Americans ca n’t afford to VB it , especially the most vulnerable or at NN populations — for example , lower income , minority , or living in more densely populated areas — it will likely be a major issue , "" Jekielek VBD . Of course , pricing is n’t the only hurdle pharma NNS face in navigating their reputations through developing and delivering NN - CD NNS and treatments . Managing expectations — for instance , avoiding overpromising and underdelivering on a NN 's timeline — is another important consideration , VBD N. Craig Smith , the chaired professor of ethics and JJ responsibility at INSEAD graduate business school in France . Smith pointed to JJ access to NNS and treatments , along with manufacturing and distribution issues , as other challenges . He co-authored an MIT Sloan Management Review article about the liability of the pharma industry 's competition - based model in NN - CD drug development . “ There are still questions around how drugs and NN VBP made available , who gets them RB and what prices are charged , but I do VB there ’s a great opportunity here for the industry to come out looking a whole lot better than it has in recent NNS , ” Smith VBD . Safety and efficacy of the medicines is yet another consideration . While Operation Warp Speed in both name and effort seems to be focused on speed , Lyman VBD , safety and efficacy are both more important . “ Coming up with and launching a NN fast — but CD that is neither safe or efficacious or is just CD of those — MD be an unmitigated disaster , ” he VBD . “ Not just for the NN - CD programs , but for every other NN made these days . Because then you ’re VBG to VB NNS afraid , pushed by these anti-vaccine groups , and starting to question the safety and efficacy of other NNS . ” RELATED : CD NN - CD opportunity for pharma ? A chance to bolster its reputation , Lilly CEO VBZ Jane Sarasohn - Kahn , a NN economist with NNP - NNP and blogger at NNP Populi , agreed about the NN concerns . She has already begun to VB shifts in opinions in the past few weeks as the NN wears on . “ There ’s been an erosion in public support in the U.S. for NNS — we ’ve seen challenges in getting NNS signed up into trials , and a growing chasm between folks who MD plan to take advantage of a NN - CD NN versus those who MD not , ” she VBD in an email . Still , pricing is top of mind not just for pharma NNS but for NN officials . Consumer pricing bills in both the U.S. House and Senate seek to limit NNS from profiting during national emergencies . That includes drug NNS and MD impose a 10 % profit margin for treatments or NNS . However , Anthony Fauci , M.D. , head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , cautioned at BIO this week that “ the federal NN should n’t force drug NNS to lower the costs of NN - CD NNS and treatments but should encourage fair pricing , ” according to a Bloomberg report . Where does that leave the industry ? In a delicate spot . As Forbes contributor John LaMattina summed up in his column about the importance of Gilead 's pricing decision , saying that it “ will set the tone for the NNP - CD NNS and drugs that will follow . It will RB impact the reputation of the whole industry . It ’s not an easy decision . Let ’s hope they VBP it JJ . ”"

In the next phase of the NN , led by the U.S. National Institutes of NNP , researchers will try to determine which dose is best for a definitive experiment that they aim to start in July . In all , 45 NNS have received CD or CD shots of the NN , which was being tested at three different doses . The kind of detailed antibody results needed to assess responses are only available on eight volunteers so far . The NN seems safe , the NN VBD , but much more extensive testing is needed to VB if it remains so . A high dose version is being dropped after spurring some short - term side effects . The results have not been published and are only from the JJ of three stages of testing that NNS and drugs normally undergo . U.S. NN officials have launched a project called “ Operation Warp Speed ” to develop a NN and hopefully have 300 million doses by January . Worldwide , about a dozen NN candidates are in the JJ stages of testing or nearing it . NN officials have VBN that if all goes well , studies of a potential NN might wrap up by very late this NN or early next NN . More than 4.7 million infections and 315,000 deaths from the NN have been confirmed worldwide since it emerged in China late last NN .

While the concept of an "" evolutionary tree "" originated in Darwin's "" On the Origin of NNS , "" PRP can apply this concept to anything that evolves , including viruses . NNS can VB the evolution of NNP - CoV - 2 to learn more about how the genes of the NN function . It is RB useful to make inferences about the spread of the NN around the NN , and what type of NN MD be most effective . who studies the relationships between epidemics and viral evolution , and I am among the JJ researchers now studying the evolution of NNP - CoV - 2 because it can VB researchers and public NN officials track the spread of the NN over NN . What we are finding is that the NNP - CoV - 2 NN appears to be mutating more slowly than the seasonal NN which MD allow NNS to develop a NN . Viruses evolve by mutating . That is , there are NNS in their genetic code over NN . The NN it happens is a little IN that game of telephone . Amy is the JJ player , and her word is "" CAT . "" She whispers her word to Ben , who accidentally hears "" MAT . "" Ben whispers his word to Carlos , who hears "" MAD . "" As the game of telephone goes on , the word will transform further and further away from its original form . We can VB of a biological genetic material as a sequence of letters , and over NN , sequences mutate : The letters of the sequence can VB . NNS have developed various to VB them VB how mutations occur over NN . Much IN our game of telephone , the genome sequence of the NNP - CoV - 2 NN VBZ over NN : Mutations occur randomly , and any NNS that occur in a given NN will be inherited by all copies of the next generation . Then , much as we MD try to decode how "" CAT "" became "" MAD , "" NNS can use models on genetic evolution to try to determine the most likely evolutionary history of the NN . How can we apply this to viruses IN NNP - CD ? DNA sequencing is the process of experimentally finding the sequence of nucleotides ( A , C , G and T ) — the chemical building blocks of genes — of a piece of DNA . DNA sequencing is largely used to VB JJ diseases and genetics , but in recent NNS , sequencing has become a , and as , viral sequencing will become RB more frequent as NN progresses . RNA is a molecule similar to DNA , and it is essentially a temporary copy of a short segment of DNA . Specifically , in the , DNA is transcribed into RNA . NNP - CoV - 2 is an RNA NN , meaning our DNA sequencing technologies cannot directly decode its sequence . However , NNS can RB reverse transcribe the RNA of the NN into , which can then be sequenced . Given a collection of viral genome sequences , we can use our models of sequence evolution to predict the NN 's history , and we can use this to answer questions IN , "" How fast do mutations occur ? "" or "" Where in the genome do mutations occur ? "" Knowing which genes are mutating frequently can be useful in drug design . Tracking how viruses have changed in a location can RB answer questions IN , "" How JJ separate outbreaks exist in my community ? "" This type of NN can VB public NN officials contain the spread of the NN . For NNP - CD , there has been a with all NNS . Given a collection of sequences with sample dates , NNS can infer the evolutionary history of the samples in real - NN and use the NN to . CD such initiative is , an open - source project that provides users real - NN reports of the spread of , and JJ other infectious diseases . Most recently , they have been spearheading the evolutionary tracking of NN - CD by providing a as well as a meant to be readable by the general public . Further , they enable the JJ population to benefit from their efforts by translating the situation report to JJ other languages . As the amount of available NN grows , NNS need faster tools to be able to crunch the numbers . at UC San Diego , in collaboration with the led by , is working to create JJ algorithms , software tools and computer hardware to make the real - NN analysis of the NN - CD epidemic more feasible . What have we learned about the epidemic ? Based on current data , it seems as though NNP - CoV - 2 mutates much more slowly than the seasonal NN . Specifically , NNP - CoV - 2 seems to have a mutation rate of less than 25 mutations per NN , whereas the seasonal NN has a mutation rate of . Given that the NNP - CoV - 2 genome is almost twice as JJ as the seasonal NN genome , it seems as though the seasonal NN mutates roughly four times as fast as NNP - CoV - 2 . The fact that the seasonal NN mutates so quickly is precisely why it is able to evade our NNS , so the significantly slower mutation rate of NNP - CoV - 2 gives us hope for the potential development of effective JJ - lasting NNS against the NN .

Here , Lewnard et al. examined these outbreaks using mumps NN effectiveness data and dynamic transmission modeling . They VBD that the increase in mumps NNS is more consistent with loss of NN protection over NN , rather than incomplete protection against an evolving NN population or lack of immune response to the NN . Their work RB suggested that a third NN dose MD extend protection , which MD prove useful in designing a clinical action plan to prevent the spread of mumps . After decades of declining mumps incidence amid widespread NN , the NNP NNPS and other developed NNS have experienced a resurgence in mumps NNS over the last decade . Outbreaks affecting vaccinated individuals and communities with high NN coverage have prompted concerns about the effectiveness of the live attenuated NN currently in use . It is unclear whether immune protection wanes or whether the NN protects inadequately against currently circulating mumps NN lineages . Synthesizing data from six studies of mumps NN effectiveness , we estimated that NN - derived immune protection against mumps wanes on average 27 NNS ( 95 % confidence interval , 16 to 51 NNS ) after NN . After accounting for this waning , we VBD no evidence that the emergence of heterologous NN genotypes contributed to NNS in NN effectiveness over NN . A mathematical model of mumps transmission confirmed the central role of waning immunity to the NN in the re-emergence of mumps NNS . Outbreaks from 2006 to the present among young adults , and outbreaks in the late 1980s and early 1990s among adolescents , aligned with peaks in mumps susceptibility of these age groups predicted to be due to loss of NN - derived protection . In contrast , evolution of mumps NN strains escaping immune pressure MD be expected to VB a higher proportion of NNS among NNS , not adolescents and young adults as observed . Routine use of a third NN dose at 18 NNS of age , or booster dosing throughout adulthood , MD be a strategy to prevent mumps re-emergence and should be assessed in clinical trials . Over the last decade , mumps outbreaks have thwarted the goal of eliminating indigenous or nonimported mumps NN transmission in the NNP NNPS by the NN 2010 ( 1 , 2 ) . Whereas more than 90 % of U.S. - born NNS experienced mumps infections by 20 NNS of age in the prevaccine era ( 3 ) , incidence declined substantially after licensure of a live attenuated NN ( the Jeryl Lynn NN ) in 1967 , in particular after the 1977 recommendation for its routine use among infants as part of the NNS - mumps - rubella ( MMR ) NN ( 2 ) . Outbreaks among vaccinated middle school– and high school–aged NNS arose in the late 1980s , followed by sustained reductions in incidence after NNS were recommended to receive a second MMR dose at 4 to 6 NNS of age ( 4 ) . However , an ongoing resurgence in mumps NNS began with a series of outbreaks on NN campuses in 2006 ( 2 ) . An older age of infection ( ages 18 to 29 NNS , compared to the prevaccine average of 5 to 9 NNS ) has been a defining feature of these outbreaks ( 5 ) , similar to recent occurrences in Canada , western Europe , and Asian NNS with routine MMR NN ( 6 –9 ) . These circumstances are troubling on CD fronts . RB , as JJ as 10 % of mumps infections acquired after puberty MD VB severe complications including orchitis , meningitis , and deafness , in contrast to a milder clinical course in NNS that typically involves fever and parotid gland swelling ( 10 ) . Second , most mumps NNS in recent outbreaks have been reported among young adults who received CD NN doses as recommended ( 11 ) . This observation has prompted concerns about suboptimal performance of the Jeryl Lynn NN currently in use ( 12 ) . It is unclear whether recent outbreaks in vaccinated communities are due to the waning of NN - derived immunity or to the emergence of mumps NN strains escaping NN - driven immunological pressure . Distinguishing between these possibilities is critical to policy - makers and members of the scientific and medical communities : At issue is whether the re-emergence of mumps can be prevented by modifying NN dosing schedules or whether a JJ NN must instead be developed ( 12 ) . To this end , we sought to distinguish waning of NN - derived protection from JJ - term NNS in NN effectiveness against circulating mumps strains using data from six epidemiological studies of mumps NN effectiveness performed over past decades in the NNP NNPS and Europe ( table S1 ) . Pooling data from these studies , we tested whether the strength of NN - derived immune protection declines with NN since receipt of the NN — a pattern that MD suggest NN waning — and whether the degree of protection has changed over recent decades amid shifts in the circulating population of mumps NN lineages . We then measured the potential impact of the waning of NN - derived immunity on the susceptibility of the U.S. population to mumps over the decades since NN licensure and used mathematical models to assess whether recent mumps NN transmission dynamics are more consistent with hypotheses of waning immunity or NN escape . Specifically , we compared expected age - specific infection incidence in stochastic simulations of mumps transmission within CD hypothetical vaccinated populations . The JJ was subject to waning protection based on our estimates of the duration of NN - derived immunity ; the second experienced durable protection but confronted mumps NN strains against which NN provided low degrees of protection . We used our findings to evaluate alternative NN policies aiming to enhance protection among adults . Evidence of waning immunity in studies of NN effectiveness Uncertainty about the protective efficacy of the Jeryl Lynn mumps NN — ranging from 95 % after a single dose in randomized controlled trials ( 13 ) to < 50 % CD - dose effectiveness during recent outbreaks ( 14 ) —has undermined efforts to gauge population immunity . This variation in estimates of effectiveness permitted us to evaluate several hypotheses about the reasons mumps NNS have re-emerged among vaccinated persons ( 2 , 12 ) . Fitting a meta- regression model to data from prospective and retrospective cohort studies ( table S1 ) , we identified that the NN elapsed since receipt of an individual ’s last NN dose accounted for 66.4 % of unexplained variation in published NN effectiveness estimates ( Fig. 1 , A to C ) . Applying our estimate of the NN waning rate to a model of exponentially distributed durations of protection , we estimated that immunity persists , on average , 27.4 NNS [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 16.7 to 51.1 NNS ] after receipt of any dose . Among 96.4 % ( 95 % CI , 94.0 to 97.8 % ) of individuals expected to mount primary responses to mumps NN , we thus expected that 25 % MD lose protection within 7.9 NNS ( 95 % CI , 4.7 to 14.7 NNS ) , 50 % within 19.0 NNS ( 95 % CI , 11.2 to 35.4 NNS ) , and 75 % within 38.0 NNS ( 95 % CI , 22.4 to 70.8 NNS ) . Synthesis of prospective and retrospective cohort studies estimating the relative NN of clinical mumps in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals . We illustrate the results of our meta - analysis of studies of mumps NN effectiveness , from which we estimated rates of NN waning . ( A ) Shown here is how estimates of NN effectiveness ( defined as CD minus the relative NN ( RR ) of experiencing mumps for a vaccinated individual , relative to an unvaccinated individual ) differ across the six studies analyzed here . NN since last dose accounts for 66.4 % of residual variation in estimates after accounting for random sources of between - NN heterogeneity . Points representing NN - level estimates are scaled in size to reflect differences in sample size . Lines signify 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) ; arrows indicate where values rounded to the nearest hundredth equal zero . ( B ) At 6 months after NN receipt ( the earliest NN point assessed in primary studies ) , we estimate that 96.4 % ( 94.0 to 97.8 % ) of recipients are protected ; we apply this as our estimate of the probability of NN take . ( C ) A parsimonious model of exponentially distributed durations of protection predicts loss of protection after , on average , NNS ( 95 % CI , 16.7 to 51.1 ) , as indicated by the yellow - plotted area . The blue - plotted area illustrates the distribution of times to loss of protection for vaccinated individuals , generated by pooling exponential distributions parameterized using estimates of ω . ( D ) Contrary to the hypothesis of reduced effectiveness against diverse mumps genotypes currently in circulation , we did not identify evidence of a decline in NN effectiveness over NN , whereas evidence of waning NN - derived immunity persisted in a model adjusting for calendar NN . Unadjusted estimates of the relative NN of clinical mumps given NN — and estimates adjusted for NN since NN , NNS since 1964 , and doses received — are calculated via meta- regression using incidence data from the original studies ( 13 , 46–50 ) . ( E ) Using this meta - regression framework , we identified no difference ( posterior CD - sided P > 0.1 ) in the waning rate ( as defined by the inverse of the association between NN since NN and relative NN of mumps given NN ; VB Materials and Methods ) after receipt of a JJ or second dose ( 95 % CI , 33 % decrease to 72 % increase in the relative NN of mumps given NN per log NN since NN ; posterior CD - sided P > 0.1 ) . The gradual replacement of predominantly A - genotype mumps NN in the prevaccine era by mixed genotypes after NN introduction has RB been suspected to contribute to diminished protection . However , we VBD no evidence for a decline in NN effectiveness over the NNS 1965 to 2006 , in particular after controlling for the effect of NN waning ( Fig. 1D ) . Whereas we estimated a nonsignificant 1.29 ( 95 % CI , 0.70 to 2.37 ) –fold increase in the relative NN of infection given NN for each log NN after 1964 in unadjusted analyses , this trend did not persist ( adjusted relative NN , 0.85 ; 95 % CI , 0.56 to 1.30 ) after controlling for longer NN since NN among older - age subjects in later studies . Moreover , we did not identify a difference in the duration of protection after a JJ dose of NN as compared to the duration of protection after a second dose ( Fig. 1E ) . Whereas second doses were originally recommended to bolster immunity in case of failed “ take ” of the JJ dose , our findings suggested that the second dose RB restores immunity to the degree achieved before waning of the JJ dose , thus extending protection to older ages . Together , our findings support the central role of waning immune protection as a driver of variation in NN performance . NNS in population susceptibility to mumps NN after NN introduction To understand the epidemiologic context of mumps resurgence in older age groups , we assessed how waning NN - derived immunity and declining rates of natural transmission have affected the susceptibility of the U.S. population over the decades since NN introduction . We inferred the degree of immune protection as of 1967 , when the NN was licensed , by fitting a mathematical model ( table S2 and fig . S1 ) to reproduce epidemiological dynamics in the prevaccine era at steady NN ( 15 ) . We estimated that the basic reproductive number ( R ) of mumps in the NNP NNPS — the number of infections expected to result from an initial index case in a fully susceptible population — was 4.79 before NN rollout , in agreement with previous estimates of 3 to 7 for high - income settings in the 20th century ( 16 , 17 ) . Allowing for loss of naturally acquired immunity did not improve model fit ( 15 ) , consistent with longer - term persistence of high antibody titers after natural infection in comparison to NN in NNS ( 18 ) . The ongoing resurgence in mumps among young adults corresponded to cohort - specific NNS in susceptibility resulting from NN waning and declining transmission over the decades since NN rollout ( Fig. 2 and fig . S2 ) . We estimated that 52.8 % ( 95 % CI , 41.6 to 63.1 % ) of adults ages 20 to 24 NNS and 52.6 % ( 95 % CI , 42.4 to 61.3 % ) of adults ages 25 to 29 NNS were susceptible to mumps NN infection in 2006 at the outset of the ongoing resurgence , in contrast to 33.8 % ( 95 % CI , 30.4 to 37.6 % ) and 25.2 % ( 95 % CI , 22.8 to 27.5 % ) , respectively , as of 1990 and < 10 % in each age group before NN introduction . Susceptibility has RB permeated older age groups amid the replacement of cohorts that experienced mumps as NNS . Whereas most individuals ages 65 NNS and older had natural immunity as of 2016 , we estimated that 29.2 % ( 95 % CI , 24.7 to 32.3 % ) of those ages 40 to 64 NNS were at NN of infection . Mumps incidence and estimates of population susceptibility over NN . Here , we illustrate NNS in the proportion of the population , by age , predicted to be susceptible to mumps on the basis of the estimated waning rate of NN - derived immune protection and the incidence of mumps infection in the population . ( A ) Overall rates of reported NNS declined after NN licensure in 1967 , punctuated by outbreaks primarily among adolescents from 1984 to 1992 and recent outbreaks ( 2006 onward ) centered among young adults . These outbreaks have corresponded with ( B ) peaks in the model - inferred proportion of individuals susceptible to mumps infection at 10 to CD and 20 to 29 NNS of age , respectively , and ( C ) reductions in the proportion of infections that VBP NNS and are reported because of NN protection against NNS . ( D ) NNS in the proportion of individuals susceptible to infection across different ages are plotted against rates of reported NNS . In a further validation of model predictions , the emergence and disappearance of mumps outbreaks among adolescents during the late 1980s and early 1990s corresponded to a transient increase in predicted susceptibility at ages 10 to CD NNS ( Fig. 2 ) . We estimated that susceptibility at ages 10 to 14 NNS peaked in 1991 , when 45.8 % ( 95 % CI , 39.3 to 52.4 % ) of NNS in this age group were at NN for infection , together with 43.0 % ( 95 % CI , 37.3 to 49.0 % ) of adolescents ages 15 to CD NNS . These estimates reflect 2.85 ( 95 % CI , 2.65 to 3.30 ) –fold and 3.96 ( 95 % CI , 3.43 to 4.52 ) –fold increases in age - specific susceptibility , respectively , compared to the prevaccine era . Whereas breakthrough outbreaks beginning in the 1980s were hypothesized at that NN to reflect inadequate responses of NNS to their JJ NN dose ( CD ) , our findings instead suggest that NN waning and declining natural exposure explain why adolescents were the population at highest NN for infection at that NN . We estimated that , as of 2016 , the prevalence of susceptibility among NNS ages 10 to 14 NNS declined to 34.8 % ( 95 % CI , 24.3 to 45.7 % ) because of the recommendation in 1989 for NNS to receive a second dose at ages 4 to 6 NNS ( 4 ) . Whereas most adolescents experiencing NNS during the initial resurgence had received CD dose of NN in keeping with the recommendations at that NN ( 20 , 21 ) , recent outbreaks have predominantly included individuals eligible to receive CD doses ( fig. S3 ) . Thus , the increasing age of infection in the NNP NNPS more likely tracks with NNS due to waning immunity after receipt of the second dose rather than a continuation of NNS within a single , underimmunized cohort . These findings hold in sensitivity analyses assuming 1 and 2 % annual declines in reporting effort ( corresponding to 39 and 63 % overall reductions in NN reporting by 2017 ) over the decades since NN introduction ( figs. S4 and S5 ) . Our analyses have suggested that reduced NN effectiveness relates primarily to waning protection rather than the emergence of mumps NN genotypes escaping NN - driven immunity . However , our ability to compare these hypotheses using data from previous studies is limited by a lack of data about genotype -specific protection . To better understand whether recent outbreaks are more consistent with NN waning or viral escape , we used a stochastic transmission model to compare expected epidemiologic dynamics under these scenarios in the NN 2006 , when the ongoing resurgence began . Using the approach taken above to update population immunity and transmission parameters in the absence of waning NN immunity ( figs. S6 and S7 ) , we simulated the spread of mumps NN strains against which the NN provided partial protection in a population of 1 million . Under age - structured JJ mixing patterns that formerly caused mumps NNS to center among school - aged NNS , waning of NN protection is a necessary mechanism to account for shifts in the age distribution of NNS toward adolescence and young adulthood . We VBD that strains capable of NN escape MD be expected to VB higher - than - observed incidence among younger NNS ( Fig. 3 , A to E ) . In contrast to the median age of mumps NNS of 22 NNS reported in 2006 , the predicted median age of NNS approached 14.2 NNS ( 95 % CI , 8.3 to 21.7 NNS ) as strain - specific NN effectiveness declined to 0 % . Although strains with lower ability to escape immune pressure MD not concentrate to such an extent among NNS , we expected such strains to VB low incidence in a population unaffected by waning immunity ( Fig. 3 F ) . Model - predicted overall rates of mumps incidence exceeded reported rates at lower degrees of cross-protection . As compared to predictions under scenarios of viral escape , model - predicted dynamics under NN waning provided a closer match to reported overall and age - specific incidence , with an expected median age of 22.3 NNS ( 95 % CI , 17.7 to 26.3 NNS ) among NNS . Anticipated transmission dynamics under scenarios of NN escape and NN waning . Here , we use a stochastic simulation model to predict the epidemiology of mumps outbreaks under the scenario of mumps NN escaping NN - induced immune pressure and the scenario of waning NN - derived immunity . ( A ) A stochastic model of an emerging NN - escape strain of mumps NN in a vaccinated population predicts excess incidence in young age groups , in keeping with their higher historical burden of mumps . ( B ) In contrast , the fit of a model incorporating waning NN - derived immunity matches the observed age distribution . ( C ) Higher overall incidence rates and ( D ) a younger age distribution of NNS are predicted when immune responses to the NN offer minimal cross-protection against the circulating strain , as compared to the fit of the model with waning NN immunity . ( E ) Whereas the model with a viral - escape ( VE ) strain can reproduce the age distribution of NNS at low degrees of immunological mismatch , ( F ) lower - than - reported incidence is expected under this scenario , again in contrast to the fit of a model with waning NN immunity . Lines in ( E ) and ( F ) signify 95 % CIs . If NN - derived immunity wanes or confers shorter - lasting protection against genotypes currently in circulation as compared to those circulating in 1967 , then administering additional NN doses MD VB VB transmission by extending immune protection to older ages . On the basis of analyses of the effective reproductive number ( R ) , or the number of JJ infectious NNS emerging from a single infectious case under prevailing levels of immunity , we VBD that protection afforded by CD NN doses alone is unlikely to support elimination of endemic mumps NN transmission from the NNP NNPS in the JJ term . If R stays below 1.0 , then epidemics are unlikely to be sustained in the JJ term ; because birth cohorts exposed to high rates of transmission in the 20th century are replaced by individuals whose protection comes only through NN , we expect R to approach 1.11 ( 95 % CI , 1.04 to 1.13 ; Fig. 4 ) . Although administering a third NN dose by 18 NNS of age MD not necessarily confer NN - JJ protection based on our estimate of the NN to loss of immunity , we nonetheless predict that this intervention MD extend protection through young adulthood , thereby protecting age groups at NN in recent outbreaks . Low ( 56 % ) uptake of a third dose matching adult compliance with recommended tetanus - diptheria toxoid booster doses MD be expected to sustain R around 0.88 ( 95 % CI , 0.83 to 0.91 ) , based on transmission dynamics in the NNP NNPS as of 2016 . Under a more optimistic scenario of 88 % third - dose coverage — where third - dose uptake equates second - dose uptake among already - immunized individuals — we expect R to approach 0.77 ( 95 % CI , 0.72 to 0.79 ) as cohorts previously exposed to high transmission rates age out of the population . Age - specific immunity and transmission dynamics under CD - and three - dose NN schedules . Waning NN - derived protection in the population raises the question of how additional NN doses MD affect mumps transmission . To address this question , we evaluated several scenarios . ( A ) Cohorts over 40 NNS of age as of 2016 were exposed to endemic transmission before and shortly after NN rollout and likely retain NN - JJ protection . However , a population protected only by CD - dose NN MD be expected to experience high prevalence of susceptibility over 20 NNS of age . ( B and C ) Our modeling suggests that the duration of protection can be extended through young adulthood by adding a third dose around 18 NNS of age , whereas routine booster doses every 10 or 20 NNS MD be expected to sustain longer - term protection . Lines and shaded areas delineate median estimates and 95 % CIs , respectively . ( D ) Under transmission dynamics estimated as of 2016 , protection in young adult age groups achieved through the use of a third NN dose is expected to reduce the effective reproductive number ( R ) below 1 . We , however , predict R to approach 1.10 under the CD - dose schedule as cohorts that experienced high rates of mumps infection age out of the population ; larger reductions in R are sustained at higher coverage and with more frequent dosing . Colors are the same as in ( A ) to ( C ) . R , basic reproductive number . ( E ) In turn , these extensions of protection provide a stronger barrier against emergence of strains escaping NN immunity . A JJ strain with 8.5 % ( 95 % CI , 7.6 to 9.8 % ) probability of evading NN - induced immunity and infecting a NN - protected individual MD be expected to succeed under a three - dose schedule with low coverage . We , however , estimate that a JJ strain MD require 22.9 % ( 95 % CI , 16.4 to 29.7 % ) probability of infecting such an individual to emerge in a population with 88 % uptake of the third dose and 10 - NN boosters . Lines denote 95 % CIs , and shaded areas represent distributions around R estimates . Whereas we estimated that most older adults are currently immune to mumps NN because of previous infection , our modeling suggested that neither a CD - dose nor a three - dose NN program MD be expected to protect more than 50 % of adults beyond the age of 40 NNS in the JJ term . This concern MD motivate the use of routine booster doses in adulthood ( Fig. 4 ) . On the basis of our model , we expect that administering additional doses every 10 or 20 NNS MD lead to sustained protection in , at minimum , 68.0 % ( 95 % CI , 58.5 to 77.6 % ) and 55.2 % ( 95 % CI , 44.1 to 68.4 % ) of the population , respectively , under a scenario of 88 % NN coverage ; at the lower ( 56 % ) coverage level , we estimated protection among , at minimum , 59.0 % ( 95 % CI , 48.2 to 71.2 % ) and 45.5 % ( 95 % CI , 34.3 to 60.5 % ) of adults with dosing every 10 or 20 NNS , respectively . Maintaining high prevalence of immunity in the population through repeated dosing MD RB VB to contain emergence of JJ mumps NN strains ( Fig. 4E ) . To sustain R ≥ 1 under three - dose schedules , we estimated that an emerging strain MD require , at minimum , 8.5 % ( 95 % CI , 7.6 to 9.8 % ) to 15.7 % ( 95 % CI , 11.9 to 20.3 % ) probability of causing infection in exposed persons otherwise protected by NN . Adding booster doses every 10 NNS increased this threshold probability to between 16.6 % ( 95 % CI , 12.5 to 20.8 % ) and 22.9 % ( 95 % CI , 16.4 to 29.7 % ) at varying degrees of NN coverage . Resurgent outbreaks centered among young adults have brought renewed attention to mumps after decades of progress toward its elimination from the NNP NNPS ( 2 , 12 ) . Understanding why NNS have re-emerged is essential for determining how to contain the NN through NN . Our analyses show that NN - derived immune protection wanes over NN . We estimate the rate of waning and demonstrate that this waning immunity accounts for susceptibility in the age groups experiencing outbreaks over the decades since NN introduction in the NNP NNPS . In contrast , NNS in the circulating genotypes of mumps NN over this same period have not been associated with reductions in NN effectiveness ; moreover , our modeling suggests that mumps NN strains escaping NN protection MD be expected to VB disproportionate incidence among younger NNS , which has not been observed in most recent outbreaks . Guided by these outcomes , our model shows that routine use of a third NN dose around 18 NNS of age , with or without regular dosing in adulthood , MD VB maintain immune protection in the population . Distinguishing between the contributions of NN waning and the emergence of NN - escape NN strains to mumps resurgence helps inform whether JJ NNS are needed to VB transmission ( 22 , 23 ) . Our findings that NN effectiveness has not declined amid the replacement of genotype A mumps viruses ( from which the Jeryl Lynn NN strain was derived ) , and that the age distribution of recent NNS is inconsistent with expectations under NN escape , are in agreement with several lines of evidence that mumps NN protects broadly against heterologous strains ( 24 ) . Neutralizing antibody responses to the Jeryl Lynn strain are effective in vitro against wild - type mumps NN strains responsible for recent outbreaks among vaccinated individuals ( 25 , 26 ) , and genetic distinctions have not been identified between strains isolated from vaccinated and unvaccinated mumps patients ( 27 ) . High efficacy and effectiveness estimates for both the Jeryl Lynn ( genotype A–derived ) and Urabe ( genotype B–derived ) NNS against clinical illness caused by heterologous mumps genotypes further substantiate the notion of cross-neutralizing or monotypic immune responses ( 12 ) . Although the efficacy of a third dose has not been assessed in clinical trials , several observations suggest effectiveness of extended NN schedules . Although congregated U.S. military populations resemble high - NN groups based on their age distribution and close - contact environments , no outbreaks have been reported in the military since a policy of administering an MMR dose to incoming recruits , regardless of NN history , was adopted in 1991 ( 28 ) . In addition , receiving a third dose was associated with protection in a recent observational NN after a third - dose NN undertaken in response to a NN campus outbreak ( 29 ) , building on limited evidence from previous studies where third doses were only administered at the tail end of outbreaks ( 30–33 ) . Trials demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of adult NN doses remain ideal to guide policy around the benefits of routine or reactive use of third doses and MD improve our understanding of immunological correlates of protection ( 34–36 ) . Such trials — or further observational studies — will RB play an important role in establishing the duration of protection after third or additional doses in adulthood . Modifying MMR NNS to improve the magnitude or duration of immune responses against mumps NN MD RB improve protection . Notably , the mumps component of the NN induces lower - avidity antibody responses , and weaker specific memory B cell proliferation , than the NNS and rubella components ( 37 , 38 ) . Several limitations of the analysis should be considered . Our use of aggregated rather than individual - level data from NN effectiveness studies contributed to an imprecise estimate of the NN to loss of immunity , in turn limiting the precision of our estimates of population susceptibility . Individual - level data from postlicensure NN studies MD support better inferences about the magnitude and duration of NN protection , thus aiding policy decisions . Identifying immunological correlates of protection from such data sets MD RB aid evaluations of alternative NN schedules and measurements of population immunity . Second , we lack data on genotype - specific incidence that MD VB us infer differential protection of the Jeryl Lynn NN against circulating strains . Epidemiological studies of outbreaks caused by distinct NN lineages , and in populations exposed to different circulating mumps viruses , can better characterize genotype specificity in the strength or duration of NN protection . Last , our analysis addresses mumps epidemiology in the NNP NNPS , where prevalence of immunity within particular birth cohorts MD differ in relation to settings that introduced routine mumps NN later or use different NN schedules . The burden of NNS and prevalence of immunity across ages or birth cohorts should be considered as a basis to guide NN policy within specific NNS . Analyzing nationally aggregated incidence data sets RB limited our ability to investigate how geographic or socioeconomic differences in NN uptake and contact rates contribute to the dynamics of focal outbreaks , as might occur in close - contact settings such as NN dormitories ( 39 , 40 ) . However , our inferences about NN waning and the changing age distribution of mumps NNS offer insight into why mumps resurgence has been possible throughout geographically and socioeconomically distinct communities . In this regard , the widespread re-emergence of mumps in NN - compliant communities stands in stark contrast to the focal re-emergence of NNS in communities with low NN coverage ( 11 ) . NNS in the epidemiology of mumps have implications for NN surveillance . Diminished clinical awareness of mumps , expectations that it appears in pediatric rather than adult populations , and protection against NNS in vaccinated individuals ( 41 ) MD limit routine detection of NNS and thus bias NN reporting . Serological surveys have provided evidence of higher - than - reported rates of mumps NN infection in the NNP NNPS before 2006 ( 28 , 42 ) . The tendency to identify outbreak - associated NNS through contact tracing MD RB favor detection of NNS in NN campuses and other closely connected populations , underscoring the importance of epidemiological surveillance to identify infections occurring in the community . The ongoing resurgence in mumps among young adults has undermined previous enthusiasm about near - term elimination of this NN from the NNP NNPS ( 1 ) . Our analysis suggests that vaccinated individuals lose protection against infection on average 27 NNS after receipt of their last dose and that this rate of NN waning explains susceptibility in adolescent and young adult cohorts at the NN of postlicensure outbreaks in these age groups . Re-emergence of mumps among older , previously vaccinated individuals whose immunity has waned parallels recent experience with varicella outbreaks affecting immunized communities as a result of waning NN - derived protection ( 43 ) . As demonstrated in mumps epidemiology , immunity in previously infected cohorts MD buffer transmission and delay breakthrough epidemics from occurring until decades after NN introduction . We expect population susceptibility to mumps to continue increasing as transient NN - derived immunity supersedes previous infection as the main determinant of mumps susceptibility in the U.S. population . These observations indicate the need for either innovative clinical trial designs to measure the benefit of extending NN dosing schedules or JJ NNS to address the problem of waning NN - induced protection ( 44 ) . Our NN is composed of four parts . RB , we conducted a meta - analysis of six studies on mumps NN effectiveness in the NNP NNPS and Europe to assess hypotheses of waning protection and diminished effectiveness against currently circulating strains . We then applied estimates of the waning rate from this analysis to infer NNS over NN in the susceptibility of the U.S. population , accounting for NN uptake and incidence of natural infection . We integrated a system of differential equations forward from initial conditions , defined from the prevaccination endemic equilibrium ( as inferred over the NNS 1960 to 1964 ) , by NN - calculating transmission rates from reported mumps incidence . We next modeled expected transmission dynamics under scenarios of NN waning and viral escape and estimated JJ - term impacts of adult NN schedules on population susceptibility . Full technical details pertaining to our analyses are presented in Supplementary Materials and Methods ( a brief summary is provided here ) . We performed a systematic review of prospective and retrospective cohort studies calculating effectiveness of the Jeryl Lynn strain mumps NN via a PubMed search and citation tracking . Details of the studies used to infer NN effectiveness are listed in table S1 . We used an inverse variance - weighted meta- regression model , accounting for NN - level heterogeneity , to measure unadjusted and multivariate - adjusted associations of the following variables with NN - level estimates of the relative NN of infection associated with NN : ( i ) NN since receipt of the last NN dose , indicating waning NN immunity ; ( ii ) NN from 1964 ( when the Jeryl Lynn NN was developed ) to the NN of mumps exposure , indicating JJ - term NNS in NN effectiveness associated with NNS in circulating genotypes ; and ( iii ) NN doses received , with an interaction term for NN since the last dose to test for differential waning of JJ and second doses . Regression model summary statistics indicated the proportion of variance explained by these covariates . We used our estimate of the association between instantaneous NN of infection and NN since NN to fit an exponential distribution to the duration of NN - derived immune protection and used this fitted distribution as the basis for further modeling . We used a system of ordinary differential equations to describe NNS in the population of susceptible and protected persons , partitioned into those who had and had not received mumps NNS . Updating the model to address the contributions of NN and NN waning to population immunity , we RB - calculated NNS in natural immunity in the population based on the relation between reported incidence rates ( Λ ) in age group i and NN t and the force of infection to which individuals were exposed ( λ ) , the populations of susceptible unvaccinated ( S ) and vaccinated ( F ) persons , and the probabilities ( π and π , respectively ) for these individuals to experience NNS if infected . As described in Supplementary Materials and Methods , this approach allowed us to account for NNS over NN in transmission patterns leading to NN - varying estimates of the basic reproductive number . Susceptible vaccinated persons ( F ) comprised those failing to mount an immune response immediately after NN ( primary NN failure ) and those whose initial protection had waned ( secondary NN failure ) . Model parameter values and their sources are listed in table S2 . Age - specific incidence reports were collated from nationwide surveillance ( 45 ) . Our model accounted for age - structured mixing among individuals partitioned across 10 age classes ( 0 to 11 months , 1 to 4 NNS , 5 to 9 NNS , 10 to 14 NNS , 15 to CD NNS , 20 to 24 NNS , 25 to 29 NNS , 30 to 39 NNS , 40 to 64 NNS , and ≥ 65 NNS ) . Members of the ith age class encountered the force of infection cumulatively through interactions with infectious individuals ( I ) distributed across all j age classes ; the matrix C conveyed age - specific mixing patterns . We inferred starting - NN age - specific prevalence of immunity in the U.S. population ( as of 1967 ) by fitting a mathematical model of mumps transmission to recapitulate age - specific incidence in the prevaccine era at steady NN . To compare predicted incidence during an introduced outbreak against observations from the NN 2006 , we implemented stochastic realizations of extended versions of the model under scenarios where we assumed waning of immunity or circulation of strains with differential NN of infecting persons protected by NN . We assessed which scenario was more consistent with epidemiological observations on the basis of model - predicted age - specific and overall incidence rates , as well as the predicted median age of infection . We compared the JJ - term performance of different NN schedules including the addition of a third dose by 18 NNS of age and the use of routine boosters at 10 - or 20 - NN intervals through adulthood . We calculated the prevalence of age - specific immune protection achieved under these strategies and resulting values of the effective reproductive number ( R ) , describing the number of NNS an infectious individual MD be expected to VB under prevailing conditions . We RB calculated the minimum probability of immune escape a novel mumps NN strain MD need to invade a population protected under these different strategies , defined as the minimum probability of infecting a vaccinated , protected individual upon exposure such that R ≥ 1 .

The Indiana NNP Department of NNP is recommending that its residents VBP vaccinated against hepatitis A and take other steps to protect themselves from the illness before traveling to Kentucky or Michigan , both of which are experiencing JJ outbreaks of the viral infection . Kentucky has reported more than 300 NNS of hepatitis A since November 2017 , with 39 JJ NNS reported in the JJ week of April , according to the Kentucky Department for Public NNP . Most NNS in the NN have occurred around Louisville — the city where the Kentucky Derby is held . The famous horse race , which draws more than 150,000 NNS each NN , takes place on the JJ Saturday in NNP . "" With popular tourist events coming up in other NNS , we VBP JJ Hoosiers will be traveling to areas impacted by hepatitis A , and we VBP them to be safe , "" Pam Pontones , the Indiana deputy NN NN commissioner , VBD in a statement . "" Getting vaccinated and thoroughly washing your hands before and after preparing food and eating and after using the restroom are simple , safe and effective ways to prevent the spread of hepatitis A . "" But do you really need to VB a hepatitis A NN if you 're VBG to the Kentucky Derby ? Dr. Amesh Adalja , a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for NNP Security , VBD the Indiana recommendation is an interesting step to take , and it 's not a bad idea . "" I can VB why they MD advise it , "" Adalja VBD . "" It 's something that 's an easy measure that can minimize NN . "" [ 27 Devastating Infectious Diseases ] At the same NN , Adalja VBD Live NNP that the NN of hepatitis A probably is n't very high for the average visitor to the Derby . A number of recent U.S. hepatitis A outbreaks , including the NN in Kentucky , have occurred primarily among the homeless population and illicit - drug users — a group that MD have limited access to clean toilets and handwashing facilities , which are important in preventing the spread of hepatitis A . But hepatitis A outbreaks can RB occur through contaminated food , Adalja noted — for instance , if food workers contract the illness and handle food without properly washing their hands . ( The Kentucky hepatitis A outbreak has not been linked with contaminated food , although it was recently reported that a McDonald 's employee in Berea , Kentucky , south of Lexington , had the infection and MD have potentially spread it to customers . ) If Kentucky Derby - goers VBP to minimize their NN of getting the illness , "" the NN is CD NN to do that , "" Adalja VBD . Hepatitis A is a contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A NN , according to the Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention . The NN is spread through the "" fecal - oral "" route — that is , when small amounts of stool from an ill person contaminate objects , food or drinks that are then touched and ingested by another person , the CDC VBZ . For this reason , thorough handwashing — particularly after using the bathroom or changing a NN 's diaper , or before eating — can VB reduce a person 's NN of getting hepatitis A , according to the Mayo Clinic . It 's important to note that the Indiana announcement is not a nationwide recommendation . In general , the CDC recommends the hepatitis NN for NNS at age 1 , as well as adults who MD be at higher NN for hepatitis A or for complications from the illness . These include travelers to NNS where hepatitis A is common , NNS who use recreational drugs , NNS with chronic liver NN , men who have sexual contact with other men , and NNS who have direct contact with others who have hepatitis A . The CDC VBZ that ideally , a person should VB the hepatitis NN CD weeks or more before departing for their trip , but getting the NN any NN before travel will provide some protection . Adalja noted that a number of Americans are already vaccinated against hepatitis A . The NN was RB licensed in 1995 and was recommended for all U.S. NNS starting in 2006 . But that MD still leave JJ adults today unvaccinated , unless they already got the NN for travel or because they fall into a group that 's at higher NN for contracting the illness . NNS of hepatitis A infection usually do n't appear until CD to six weeks after a person has been infected , and include fever , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , dark - yellow urine , joint NN and jaundice ( a yellowing of the NN and eyes ) , according to the CDC . NNS with the infection usually VBP better on their own without a specific NN , but in some NNS , the infection can lead to liver failure , particularly in older adults or NNS who have other liver diseases , according to the National Institutes of NNP ."

Subsequently , it became VBN that Dr Wakefield was paid for a second NN into whether NNS allegedly damaged by the MMR MD sue . The MMR NN was therefore compromised by a financial conflict of interests . The Editor of the Lancet concluded , “ If we knew then what we VBP now , we certainly MD not have published the part of the paper ( 43 c ) that related to MMR ” ( 44S ) . In March 2004 , 10 of the 12 authors of the article in question issued a “ Retraction of an interpretation ” . The authors made it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between MMR NN and NN , as the data were insufficient to prove the hypothesis ( 45S ) . In 2004 , the NNP Safety Committee of the Institute of Medicine of the US National Academies of Sciences published the Immunization Safety Review on NNPS and NNP . The Committee examined the hypothesis that NNS , specifically the MMR NN and thiomersal - containing NNS , are causally associated with NN . The Committee concluded that the NN of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relation between the MMR NN and NN as well as a causal relation between thiomersal - containing NNS and NN . The Committee further VBD that potential biological mechanisms for NN - induced NN that have been generated to date are theoretical only . In addition , the Committee recommended that available funding for NN NN be channelled to the most promising areas ( 46 M ) . The results of a retrospective NN including 535 544 NNS aged 1 – 7 NNS who were immunized between November 1982 and June 1986 in Finland , based on linkage of individual MMR immunization data to a hospital discharge register , have been published ( 47C ) . The numbers of NNS of encephalitis and aseptic meningitis within a 3 - month NN interval after immunization were compared with the estimated numbers of naturally occurring NNS of encephalitis and aseptic meningitis during the subsequent 3 - month interval . NNS in the overall number of hospitalizations because of NN and Crohn 's NN were RB checked throughout the NN period . Of the 535 544 immunized NNS , 199 were hospitalized with encephalitis , 161 with aseptic meningitis , and 352 with autistic disorders . In nine NNS with encephalitis and 10 with meningitis , the NN developed within 3 months of immunization , revealing no increased occurrence within this designated NN period . Furthermore , in eight of nine NNS of encephalitis , a very short interval of 2 days or an interval exceeding 1 month between immunization and hospitalization makes an association with immunization unlikely . As with encephalitis , an association between immunization and meningitis occurring on day 2 or over 1 month after immunization is unlikely . No clustering of hospitalization for NN has been detected after immunization ; none of the autistic NNS went into hospital because of Crohn 's NN . A NN on MMR immunization and NN has been carried out in Denmark in all 537 303 NNS born in Denmark from 1991 to 1998 . Using national registry data on autistic disorders , the investigators VBD no association between MMR immunization and a subsequent diagnosis of NN ( RR = 0.92 ; 95 % CI = 0.68 , 1.24 ) or a related disorder ( RR = 0.83 ; 95 % CI = 0.65 , 1.07 ) . This national cohort NN obviated the problems of selection bias and misclassification bias ( 48C ) . In a case - NN NN of age at JJ MMR immunization in NNS with NN ( n = 624 ) and NNS without ( n = 1824 ) , including NNS with regression in development , the overall distribution of ages at MMR immunization among NNS with NN was similar to that of matched NN NNS ( 49C ) . Most of the NNS ( 71 % ) and NN NNS ( 68 % ) were immunized at 12 – 17 months of age . Similar proportions of case and NN NNS had been immunized before 18 or before 24 months of age . There were no significant associations for either of these age cutoffs in specific case subgroups , including those with evidence of developmental regression . CD of the major reasons that NNS occurred among bone marrow transplant recipients during an outbreak of NN in Brazil was that they had not been immunized . In Brazil , a 2 - NN interval between bone marrow transplantation and NNS immunization was recommended . Following a NN in 79 patients the investigators concluded that MMR immunization between 12 and 24 months after bone marrow transplantation is safe and will therefore be recommended at 15 months after transplantation . However , because the serocon-version rate to NN is only 46 % ( rubella 91 % ) , serology should be performed after immunization to confirm protection ( 50 c ) ."

In addition to making a mockery of pre-licensing safety testing and post - marketing surveillance , these entities have regularly manipulated ( or destroyed ) data to exaggerate both the benefits and effectiveness of NN . Manufacturers have RB used their money and power to subordinate the mainstream NN , medical journals and front groups , making it possible to publish and broadcast deceptive studies that whitewash questions inconvenient to the financial bottom line . From multiple standpoints — not least of which is NNS ’s dismal NN of NN — the status quo is untenable . Three of the most urgent steps to be taken include repealing the NCVIA , eliminating NN mandates ( making both childhood and adult NN voluntary ) and addressing conflicts of interest by establishing a fully transparent and independent NN safety commission . The NCVIA has been an unmitigated disaster . As NNP York NNP law professor Mary Holland has written , the Act ’s passage has allowed the NN and NN manufacturers to ride roughshod over three important legal protections : • Free and informed consent to an invasive medical procedure • Accurate and complete NN about NN ingredients and possible side effects • The NN to sue manufacturers and medical practitioners directly in the event of injury . According to Holland , the absence of these legal protections for NN is “ striking ” compared to “ almost all other medical interventions . ” The legal protections are interrelated . For example , an individual cannot exercise truly informed consent unless he or she has access to full and unbiased NN . Recognizing this , CD provision of the NCVIA was a mandate for the CDC to develop ( and NN care providers to distribute ) patient education materials about NN risks and benefits . However , not only has the CDC repeatedly dumbed down the materials in a variety of ways , but NN suggests that JJ doctors do not comply with the legal requirement to hand out ( much less discuss ) them . Instead , providers and the NN continue to blandly assure the public that NN injuries are a “ CD in a million ” event , never mentioning that 99 % of NN injuries VBP unreported . Under the circumstances , no meaningful assessment of NN risks is possible . NN shows that by eliminating consumers ’ ability to sue , the NCVIA has had a tangibly negative effect on NN safety . After an extensive analysis of nationwide and NN - level U.S. data , a researcher reported in 2017 that NNS licensed after NCVIA ’s passage were associated with “ a significantly higher incidence of adverse events ” compared to NNS licensed prior to the law ’s passage . The researcher concluded that “ product safety deteriorates when consumers are no longer able to sue manufacturers . ” Repealing the NCVIA and reinstating product liability MD not solve all of the ethical problems that permeate the pharmaceutical industry ’s business culture , but it MD curtail the “ free - for - all ” environment that has prevailed since 1986 and might incentivize manufacturers to treat NNS in the same NN as drugs and put safety on somewhat of a more RB footing with profits … ."

For example , in early February , the spread among JJ growth forecasts for Q2 in the U.S. was 3.5 percentage points according to FocusEconomics data . By April 29 , the most optimistic forecast among the 28 institutions in our weekly NN survey saw the U.S. economy contracting 8.2 % . The most pessimistic projected a huge 65.0 % contraction — a spread of 56.8 percentage points — with an average of - 31.4 % . There are three reasons for the divergence : RB , the JJ impact and speed of policy NNS have never been higher . Second , the NN is undermining the reliability of JJ data . Finally , JJ forecasters are having to delve into the unfamiliar NN of epidemiology . The NN NN has introduced extreme uncertainty into nearly every aspect of society . Will NN care systems hold up ? Will NNS develop a NN ? Are essential workers safe ? When can regular employees VB RB to the office ? The answers to these questions — when there are answers — seem to VB daily . And with each NN the stock market ( and our hopes ) rises or falls . Since the NNP - CD NN began , we ’ve seen pervasive uncertainty manifest in a sudden and massive divergence in macroeconomic projections . For example , in early February , the spread among JJ growth forecasts for Q2 in the U.S. was 3.5 percentage points according to FocusEconomics data . By April 29 , the most optimistic forecast among the 28 institutions in our weekly NN survey saw the U.S. economy contracting 8.2 % . The most pessimistic projected a huge 65.0 % contraction — a spread of 56.8 percentage points — with an average of - 31.4 % . While most institutions expected a rebound in Q3 , some saw further declines . And in Q4 , although all economists projected growth of some form , forecasts ranged from a minimum of +1.1 % and a maximum of +70.0 % . The spreads observed in recent weeks are by far the widest recorded since we started covering the U.S. a decade ago . Looking at NNS with a longer NN horizon , the current forecast spread among analysts is far larger than at any point during the past 20 NNS , and significantly above that seen during the height of the financial crisis — the last period of extreme , prolonged JJ uncertainty . For example , during the 2008 financial crisis , both Brazil and Mexico saw the spread for annual GDP forecasts widen to close to six percentage points , before returning to under three for most of the 2010s . The percentage point spread is now well over seven percentage points . Why So Much Divergence ? The short answer to why there is so much divergence is because no NN knows for sure what is VBG to happen . Digging deeper , three key factors are causing forecasters particular difficulties . RB , the JJ impact and speed of policy NNS have never been higher . In normal times , most governments can be relied on to at least attempt to encourage JJ growth and preserve employment . Today , however , they are deliberately provoking recessions to save lives , and containment measures are crushing domestic activity . Simply miscalculating the end date of a nationwide lockdown by a couple of weeks throws annual GDP forecasts completely off - kilter . Moreover , bills which generally endure months of parliamentary ping - pong are being rushed through legislatures in days as governments and central banks race to respond to the rapid advance of the NN . JJ governments have adopted emergency powers allowing them to rule by decree . What ’s more , the fiscal and monetary stimulus being announced to palliate the downturn dwarfs that seen during the financial crisis . For JJ forecasters , keeping up with the constant flurry of measures and correctly incorporating them into models poses challenges . Second , the NN is undermining the reliability of JJ data — the bedrock of any good macroeconomic model . In particular , survey - based data of businesses and households is suffering as lockdown measures reduce response rates , amplifying sampling error . The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data for March , for instance , saw establishments ’ and households ’ response rates fall by nine and 10 percentage points respectively relative to their recent average . Paul Donovan , chief economist at UBS NNP Wealth Management , explained the problem this NN : “ If you are filling in survey forms in a lockdown , you are likely to be an unusual person , and possibly not representative . Sentiment affects answers to surveys . Data , IN consumer price inflation , includes restaurant prices , but restaurants are closed . What happens when you survey something that is not there ? Online spending is likely to have increased in lockdowns . Online spending MD stay higher after the lockdowns end . It MD not be properly captured in official data . ” The third reason the models are diverging so much is because JJ forecasters are having to delve into the unfamiliar NN of epidemiology to better understand the likely evolution of the NN outbreak in each country . However , this is a challenge RB for NN experts . Predicting the scope and effectiveness of future public NN interventions , or how NN care systems will respond under pressure , is tough — particularly for NNS at early stages of their epidemics . There is no firm timeline for the arrival of game - changing treatments or NNS , or clarity over the likelihood or severity of a second wave of NNS . The divergence in JJ forecasts should narrow somewhat VBG forward . Greater clarity will emerge on the effectiveness of recent stimulus , and any further fiscal or monetary measures will likely be more modest in scope . The gradual lifting of lockdowns will facilitate the collection of JJ data . Our knowledge of the NN and its spread will improve . But a return to pre-virus levels of JJ uncertainty will have to wait until a lasting solution to the NN — likely in the form of a NN — is VBN . While the NN NN poses a unique challenge to macroeconomic forecasters , the profession has faced similarly profound shocks in the past and emerged fortified . The JJ financial crisis of 2008 caught most economists napping . But the insights gained in areas such as the economics of financial contagion and the impact of unconventional monetary measures have improved the quality of today ’s forecasting models . In the same NN , NNP - CD will shine JJ light on areas such as behavioral economics — how consumer spending is affected by fear of contagion for instance — and the JJ effects of radical fiscal policy . The knowledge gained MD make the uncertainty of future JJ crises , whenever and however they come , that bit less extreme ."

RB if 80 percent of the country managed to trace NNS effectively — “ which MD be miraculous , ” he VBD — the remaining 20 percent MD be a constant source of JJ infections .

This is misleading . Some iterations of the claim , titled “ Bill Gates Faces Trial in India for Illegally Testing Tribal NNPS with NNPS ” , can be seen here and here . A spokesperson for the Gates Foundation confirmed to Reuters via email that the allegations in the claim are false . There is no pending lawsuit against Gates or his foundation in relation to this . The NN trial in question was not illegal , though it was later halted and has been the source of controversy in India . The claims refer to a NNP Papilloma NNP ( HPV ) NN NN conducted by the U.S. non-profit organization Program for Appropriate Technology in NNP ( PATH ) . The NN , which was financed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , was cancelled in 2010 after local NN reported the death of seven girls taking part ( here , here ) . The NN was cancelled in 2010 following local NN reports highlighting the death of seven girls taking part . NNP Magazine reported that investigations carried out by a committee designated by the Indian NN later determined the deaths were unrelated to the NN demonstration : “ Five were evidently unrelated to the NN : CD girl drowned in a quarry ; another died from a snake bite ; CD committed suicide by ingesting pesticides ; and CD died from complications of malaria . The causes of death for the other CD girls were less certain : CD possibly from pyrexia , or high fever , and a second from a suspected cerebral hemorrhage . ” ( here ) On August 29 , 2013 the Indian Parliament ’s Standing Committee on NNP and Family Welfare reported the NN trial by PATH committed several irregularities , including a “ gross violation of the consent and legal requirement of consent ” ( VB page 14 here ) . After the report was released , PATH VBD they “ strongly disagree with the findings , conclusions , and tone of the released report and its disregard of the evidence and facts . ” ( here ) According to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ’s website , they have been working in India for over a decade , with a focus on the country ’s most vulnerable communities ( here ) . As of NNP 18 , 2020 the Foundation faces no charges in India and continues to work in the country . False . Bill Gates is not facing trial in India for an illegal NN NN .

NNS walk to school while adults meet up for dinner at their local bar . Only the vulnerable have been advised to isolate and some are working from home . Yet in Sweden , where there are 9,141 confirmed NNS and 793 NNS have died , experts worry weaker measures MD be leading to a more severe outbreak in the country of just 10 million citizens . Sweden has a relatively high case fatality rate : as of April 8 , 7.68 % of the Swedes who have tested positive for NNP - CD have died of the NN . Neighboring NNS , IN Norway and Denmark , have case fatality rates of 1.46 % and 3.85 % respectively . ( The U.S. case fatality rate is 3.21 % . ) While Sweden ’s elevated case fatality rate MD be a result of its low testing rates compared to its neighbors , experts say Sweden ’s laissez - faire approach MD RB be to blame . The Swedish NN continues to advocate for relaxed measures . The Swedish Public NNP Agency cautions citizens to cover their mouths when they cough or sneeze and wash hands regularly but does not call for lockdown measures . On March 11 , the NN cut down the size of permitted gatherings to 500 , and only lowered that down to 50 on March 29 . Other NNS , IN Germany and Australia , have prohibited gathering in groups larger than CD . On Monday , Sweden declared that domestic flights MD continue running , despite the risks domestic travel poses for spreading the NN . Anders Tegnell , Sweden ’s chief epidemiologist overseeing the NN ’s response to NNP - CD has VBN the NN should allow the NN to spread slowly through the population , an approach initially employed by the NNP Kingdom and the Netherlands before both NNS rapidly changed strategy amid mounting evidence that this approach MD still overburden NN care systems . Tegnell VBD Swedish TV on April 5 that NNP - CD MD be stopped by “ herd immunity or a combination of immunity and NN . ” ( A NN for NNP - CD is likely at least 14 months away . ) But JJ experts throughout Sweden say the current strategy is dangerous . “ Herd immunity does n’t make sense because we do n’t VB whether or not you can become immune , ” VBZ Nele Brusselaers , an associate professor of clinical epidemiology . She added , “ this is a NN that can kill anybody . ” Keep up to date with our daily NN newsletter by clicking here . At the end of March , 2,300 doctors , NNS and academics signed an open letter to the NN calling for stricter measures . “ We VBP there is no scientific evidence for their strategy , ” VBZ Cecilia Söderberg - Nauclér , an expert in microbial pathogenesis who signed the letter . She VBZ the NN has been reluctant to share its data with NNS , leading her to VB that the NN ’s strategy is “ not based on evidence . ” Carina King , an infectious diseases epidemiologist , agrees that the NN ’s lack of transparency makes it “ really hard to give proper scientific thoughts on their approach because they have n’t released their NN . ” She added that the NN has made no concrete efforts to test , contact trace and quarantine — as South Korea did — which is standard protocol to stop localized spread at the beginning of an outbreak . Nevertheless , she VBZ Sweden MD be a rare case where a nationwide lockdown MD not be necessary . “ Sweden is unique , ” she VBZ . “ It does n’t have JJ intergenerational households . It is a country where you MD have a mixed approach . ” Though interpersonal distance is valued in Swedish culture and 40 % of Swedish households are single - person households without NNS , other experts say that NNP - CD can still spread rapidly and widely in these conditions . Sweden has the second lowest number of critical care beds in Europe after Portugal , with only 5 beds for every 100,000 inhabitants . The healthcare system MD likely be unable to handle a severe NN - CD outbreak . Currently , experts say the Swedish NN is not following the NNP NNP Organization ’s ( WHO ) guidelines , which advise NNS with NN - CD outbreaks to contact trace where possible and to adopt strict self - isolation measures . “ I ’m surprised and frustrated that they still have not taken any action or listened to the advice of organizations IN WHO , ” VBZ Brusselaers . “ They disregard any prediction model that has been published by experts in the field and they do n’t RB give a defense . ” A head NN at a major hospital in Sweden VBZ the current approach will “ probably end in a historical massacre . ” He VBZ healthcare workers at his hospital who have tested positive for the NN but are asymptomatic have been advised to continue working . He asked to remain anonymous because “ it is frowned upon to speak of the epidemic or to VB against the official vision ” but VBD he felt a need to speak out from an “ ethical and medical point of view . ” The Swedish legislature will meet this week to discuss whether tougher measures restricting business and travel should be implemented . Söderberg - Nauclér VBZ it ’s already too late to prevent chaos in Stockholm but that preventative lockdown measures MD still be taken throughout other parts of the country . “ If they are JJ and we are wrong , I will open a bottle of champagne , ” Söderberg - Nauclér VBZ . She notes that , based on the modeling she ’s seen , the healthcare system in Sweden will collapse if stricter measures are not adopted immediately . “ But I will not give up the fight until the NN shows us evidence for their strategy . ” While experts MD be taking issue with the NN ’s approach , JJ Swedes seem to be in favor of it . Opinion polls show that citizens trust the Public NNP Authority , with 48 % saying they have very high or high confidence in the institution . “ It ’s rare for Swedish society to loudly disapprove of the NN , ” VBZ Fu . “ RB though NNS are concerned about losing loved ones , they RB trust that the NN is doing the JJ thing . ” And Swedes have above - average confidence in their politicians , who in turn , trust citizens to follow their advice . “ In Sweden , the approach has always been to make suggestions and let the public decide , ” VBZ Johan Erik Lallerstedt , a 23 - NN - old filmmaker living in Stockholm . “ Whatever guidelines the NN MD give are just that : suggestions . Nothing is enforced . ” But Söderberg - Nauclér believes this outbreak MD bring an end to a JJ history of public trust in NN . “ If you put NNS ’s lives at NN in democratic society and then you do not VB them , how will society trust politicians ? ” she VBZ . “ I do n’t VB to live in a society that treats NNS IN this . ” Please send any tips , leads , and stories to virus@time.com ."

China is seeking to trial potential NNS overseas because of a lack of JJ patients at home . Over a dozen experimental NNS are being trialled around the NN . None of them has yet successfully completed a late - stage "" Phase 3 "" test to determine efficacy in shielding healthy NNS from the NN , which has killed over 4,70,000 NNS around the NN . Such trials involve thousands of participants and normally take place in NNS where the NN is widespread , so that the NN can be observed in a real - NN environment . However , China , the origin of the JJ NN , reported fewer than 10 JJ local NNS a day on average last month , and its researchers are now looking abroad . CNBG announced the move in a Weibo JJ NN post , without naming the NN to be tested in the UAE . Units of CNBG , an affiliate of the NN - owned China National Pharmaceutical Group ( Sinopharm ) , have developed CD potential NNS , which have together been given to over 2,000 NNS in previous tests in China . Other Chinese NNS seeking to trial NNS overseas include Clover Biopharmaceuticals , whose shots have been given to participants in Australia in an early NN , and Sinovac Biotech , which is expected to begin a Phase 3 trial in Brazil with 9,000 volunteers ."

Prior to the advent of the 2019 - nCoV NN , it was believed that the so - called “ JJ package ” of the US - China trade agreement , which was signed on behalf of the Celestial Empire by Vice Premier of the NNP Council of the PRC Liu He , is a tactical move , thanks to which China will VB a respite . And then there is the presidential election in the USA , and it is still unknown whether Donald NNP will be able to gain a foothold in the Oval Office for a second term … But , it seems , a malicious NN that has matured either in the stomachs of bats , or in a snake ’s gut , has confused all the cards to a friend Xi Jinping . Against the background of alarming reports from the Chinese province of Hubei ( when this material was being prepared , more than 4.5 thousand NNS fell ill with pneumonia , and 106 died , and these are not final numbers . – Auth . ) Copper and iron ore prices collapsed . At the same NN , the Fitch rating agency cautiously reports that the spread of NN will RB of all have a negative impact on the economies of Thailand , Vietnam and Singapore , since in these NNS the most vulnerable regions to the epidemics are tourism and the service sector . The statement is indisputable – everyone will VB it , and yet China , presumably , is more than others , since it is the Chinese economy that is the main consumer of both metals and NN , and tourism with a service sector is not the last source of replenishment of the treasury . And since the prices of these goods went down , the Chinese economy RB caught the “ NN ” . And it is easier to negotiate with a “ sick ” client , which is well VBN RB without NNP . It is noteworthy that 2019 - nCoV got to the American technological giant Apple , whose production facilities are located just 500 kilometers from the “ home ” of the NN – the Wuhan metropolis . And now , according to the Nikkei Asian Review , the production of popular iPhone smartphones is in jeopardy . Starbucks RB VBD itself in a difficult situation , which , due to quarantine , had to close a JJ half of its four thousand coffee houses operating in China ( by the NN , this is the second largest market after the NNP NNPS ) . But at the same NN , the Americans for some reason do not look IN such victims of the epidemic , especially Apple , whose leadership at the very beginning of the trade and JJ confrontation with China advised to evacuate production facilities in the NNP NNPS . … It seems as if NNP NNP saw everything in advance , IN Wolf Messing or old Wang . However , both Apple and Starbucks were really out of luck . You ca n’t say the same about the American political establishment , which is making titanic efforts to bring to its knees the “ presumptuous China . ” And why should these efforts necessarily be of an JJ nature ? .. The main question is – who benefits from another NN unsettling a competitor ? If we apply the well - VBN trick highly likely , unceremoniously used by British ex-prime minister Theresa NNP to hang the so - called Skripals poisoning in Russia , then the answer is obvious : the NN epidemic 2019 - nCoV , which hit China , is highly likely on the hand of the NNP NNPS . And the worse for Beijing , the better for Washington . Moreover , the outlook for the epidemic is not yet encouraging . For example , some experts argue that if the spread of 2019 - nCoV cannot be stopped , up to 250 million Chinese can become victims of the NN , which is almost CD in number in Russia . By the NN , about the prospects . The Cepi NNP NNP Coalition has reportedly invested a total of $ 12.5 million in three projects , in which researchers are ready to expeditiously develop the 2019 - nCoV NN . NNS from the NNP of Queensland , as well as CD American biotechnology NNS Inovio and Moderna , participate in the work . The American National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) is RB involved . And it seems that microbiologists from Hong Kong have already developed a NN against the JJ NN , as Professor of Hong Kong NNP Ewan Kwok - Jung hastened to inform the newspaper South China Morning Post . But her NN , he claims , MD take more than a NN . German Shipulin , the deputy director of the Center for Strategic Planning of the Ministry of NNP of Russia , does not promise an imminent victory over 2019 - nCoV . So the hands of the NN 2019 - nCoV can be considered as yet untied , and there are suspicions that the NNP NNPS MD be involved in this epidemic . In the Russian NN , this assumption has already been made . US operations as part of a biological warfare against the entire planet As a result of the dengue epidemic in Cuba from 1978 - 1981 , up to 500 thousand NNS were affected . Fidel Castro VBD this was the result of an American biological attack . Washington did not confirm or refute the allegations of the Cuban leader . Pentagon bio laboratories exist in 25 NNS around the NN . They are funded by the Military Threat Reduction Agency under a $ 2.1 billion military program . The joint biological interaction program includes laboratories located in the NNS of the former Soviet Union , such as Georgia , Ukraine , Azerbaijan , Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan , as well as in the Middle East , Southeast Asia and Africa . Washington did not confirm or refute this data . By the location of these biological laboratories , we can confidently indicate the four NNS and territories against which the American biological threats are now directed , these are Russia , Iran , China and the NNS of Central and West Africa . Washington did not confirm or refute this data . The American NN CH2M Hill , under contracts for the Pentagon bio labs in Georgia , Uganda , Tanzania , Iraq , Afghanistan , Southeast Asia , was funded in the amount of $ 341.5 million . Of this amount , almost half ( $ 161.1 million ) was allocated for NN in Lugar Center in Tbilisi . Washington did not confirm or refute this data . Its subcontractor , the private NN Battelle , has been operating in the Pentagon bio labs in Afghanistan , Armenia , Georgia , Uganda , Tanzania , Iraq , Afghanistan and Vietnam . Battelle conducts NN , development , testing and assessment of the use of both highly toxic chemicals and highly pathogenic biological agents for a wide range of US NN agencies . The NN has entered into federal contracts totaling $ 2 billion and ranks 23rd in the list of 100 best US NN contractors . Washington did not confirm or refute this data . The Pentagon has a very JJ history of using insects as carriers of NN . According to a partially declassified US Army report of 1981 , American NNS conducted a series of experiments on insects . These operations were part of the US Entomological War as part of a biological weapons program . Washington did not confirm or refute this data . The report reported CD scenarios : 16 simultaneous attacks on the city by A. Aegypti mosquitoes infected with yellow fever , as well as Tularemia aerosol attack , and assessed their effectiveness in cash and JJ losses . The results were very cynical . Pentagon specialists managed to “ kill ” 625 thousand NNS at a cost of $ 0.29 per unit . Washington did not confirm or refute this data . Operation Big Itch : Field trials were conducted to determine the coverage and survivability of tropical rat fleas Xenopsylla cheopis for use as a NN carrier in biological warfare . Washington did not confirm or refute this data . Operation Big Buzz : 1 million A. Aegypti mosquitoes were raised . CD third of them were placed in ammunition , dropped from aircraft and scattered on the ground . Mosquitoes survived in the air and actively sought JJ NN . Washington did not confirm or refute this data . Operations on military experiments with tropical mosquitoes and ticks in Georgia . Such NNS of mosquitoes and fleas ( which were studied in the past as part of the US Entomological War Program ) were imported into Georgia and tested at the Lugar Center . Washington did not confirm or refute this data . Anthrax is CD of the biological agents in the NN of the US Army , not only in the past . Despite Pentagon claims that this program is only defensive , there are facts to the contrary . In 2016 , at the Lugar Center , American NNS conducted a NN “ Genome Sequence of the Soviet / Russian Bacillus anthracis NNP Strain 55 - VNIIVViM ” ( Genome Sequence of the Soviet / Russian Anthracite Cancer NNP in Russia ) , which was funded by the US Agency ’s Biological Weapons Sharing Program Threat Reduction ( DTRA ) in Tbilisi , and implemented by Metabiota . Washington did not confirm or refute this data . Congo - Crimean hemorrhagic fever ( CCHF ) is caused by the tick - borne NN Nairovirus ( Nairovirus ) . The NN was RB described in Crimea in 1944 and was called Crimean hemorrhagic fever . Later , it caused an epidemic in the Congo in 1969 . In 2014 , 34 NNS were infected with the CCHF , including a 4 - NN - old NN , three of whom died . Pentagon biologists are currently studying the NN in Georgia as part of the DTRA project , Epidemiology of febrile illnesses caused by Dengue viruses and other Arboviruses in Georgia . The project included trials on patients with fever NNS and collection of ticks as possible distributors of CCHV for laboratory analysis . Washington did not confirm or refute this data . Similar CCHV outbreaks occurred in Afghanistan , where 3 Pentagon bio-laboratories are present . As of December 2017 , 237 NNS of CCHV were reported in this country , 41 of which were fatal . Washington did not confirm or refute this data . Bats are RB being studied as a carrier of various diseases at the Lugar Center , which NNS say are carriers of the Ebola NN , Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) and other deadly diseases . As of June 2017 , 1980 NNS were recorded with 699 deaths in CD NNS around the NN caused by MERS - CoV . This NN is designed and manufactured in the USA . Washington did not confirm or refute this data . Another weapon of bioterrorism is , according to a 1981 US Army report , Tularemia , or Rabbit Fever , developed in the USA . JJ tularemia carriers , such as ticks and rodents , are currently being developed . DTRA has launched a number of projects on Tularemia and in Georgia at the Lugar Center . Highly pathogenic agents ( EDP ) can be used for military purposes . Washington did not confirm or refute this data . Ukraine itself does not have NN over military biological laboratories on its territory . Under the 2005 Agreement between the US Department of Defense and the Department of NNP of Ukraine , the Ukrainian NN is prohibited from publicly disclosing confidential NN about the US program . Ukraine is RB required to transfer all dangerous pathogens to the US Department of Defense for biological NN . Under this Agreement , the Pentagon was granted access to JJ NN secrets of Ukraine . Washington did not confirm or refute this data . The Pentagon has invested at least $ 65 million in gene editing NN . The U.S. Department of Defense Advanced NNP Projects Agency ( DARPA ) has provided seven NN teams to develop tools for altering the genome of insects , rodents , and bacteria through the DARPA Safe Gene program using JJ CRISPR - Cas9 technology . Washington did not confirm or refute this data . The worst biological weapon that MD have already been used and possibly used in Russia is , again , perhaps used against the “ enemy ” of the USA – China . Until recently , ethnic biological weapons ( biogenetic weapons ) were theoretical weapons , the purpose of which is , RB of all , to harm NNS of certain ethnic groups or genotypes ( Russians , Chinese , etc. ) . Although officially the NN and development of ethnic bio-weapons has never been publicly confirmed , documents show that the NNP NNPS collects biological materials from certain ethnic groups – Russians and Chinese . American National Socialism in its purest form . US Air Force specifically collects samples of Russian DNA and synovial tissue , which causes concern in Moscow about a hidden American program for the use of biological weapons . Senator Franz Klintsevich commented on the words of NNP Vladimir Putin on the purposeful collection of Russian biomaterial : “ In the West , everything is done very scrupulously and verified to the smallest detail : if we use biological weapons , then surely … The relevant services in the West should VB that we are aware of their interest . Let those who are engaged in this work on the territory of the Russian Federation not be offended . ” And it can not be VBN that such suspicions have no reason . As you VBP , the NNP NNPS ratified the Geneva Protocol and the Biological Weapons Convention RB in 1975 . But biological games overseas have not stopped , and not only in the national territory . Already after the collapse of the USSR , American biological laboratories appeared , which is precisely established in Georgia , Ukraine , Kazakhstan , Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan . Where else – except that the NNP Department knows that it claims to be absolutely peaceful organizations involved in the development of medicines . But if they are so peaceful , then why , PRP wonders , did the Americans build them not at home , but at the other end of the NN ? Comments , as they say , are unnecessary . Not so RB ago , the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation analyzed documents on the activities of the so - called “ NN center ” that the Americans built in Georgia , and came to the conclusion : in fact , this is a “ death factory ” , which killed 73 NNS who were used by overseas biologists as experimental rabbits . But the fact of the matter is that American bio-laboratories are scattered not only around Russia , but RB around the NN , where America has its own interests . And another question , where did the 2019 - nCoV NN originate – in a bat or in some American “ NN center ” ? Where is it more highly likely ? You can actually participate in the JJ efforts to cripple the Deep NNP organized criminal cabal 's ability for genocide , while enjoying healthcare freedom at the same NN , by boycotting Big Pharma for good ."

Everyone_NN in_IN my_PRP$ family_NN does_VBZ ._. ”_''","VB breaking NN alerts and special reports . The NN and stories that matter , delivered weekday mornings . Here ’s a good reason to VB a NN shot every single NN : NNS who got a JJ NN every NN season were less likely to die or end up in the hospital with severe NN , a JJ NN shows . A look at NNS taken to the hospital with influenza showed that those who had been vaccinated repeatedly did better than those who had only been vaccinated in the current NN . The NN of NNS over 65 — who are most likely to die from influenza — showed that repeated NN was twice as good at preventing the most severe complications of NN . “ The prevention of severe and fatal infection caused by influenza was observed mainly in patients who were vaccinated in both the current and previous seasons , ” Dr. Itziar Casado and Dr. Jesús Castilla of the Institute for Public NNP in Pamplona , Spain , wrote in the Canadian Medical Association Journal . "" Repeated NN for influenza was highly effective in preventing severe and fatal infection caused by influenza in older adults , "" they added . This makes sense to David Topham , a microbiologist and immunologist at the NNP of Rochester Medical Center , who was not involved in the NN . “ We probably only VBP exposed to influenza , the NN , every three to five NNS on average , ” Topham VBD NBC NNP . Related : Most kids who died of NN were n't vaccinated “ That ’s plenty of NN for your immunity to wane . Getting the NN every NN boosts your immunity . ” And repeated NN MD VB broader immunity , both Topham and the researchers VBD . NNS stimulate both the production of antibodies and cells called T - cells to fight germs . Repeated NN might more effectively boost the action of T - cells . It ’s a reassuring finding . A couple of small studies had suggested that getting the NN NN every NN might increase some NNS ’s NN of catching NN , RB though it was hard to explain why that might happen . Topham VBD he did not VB the evidence shows repeated NNS are harmful . “ I VBP it might not be the case for most NNS , ” he VBD . “ It was a very slight effect . ” And , he VBD , most studies had shown the opposite — that getting a NN NN every NN prevents infection better than getting vaccinated once in a while . A separate NN suggested that pregnant women who got a certain NN NN CD NNS in a row were more likely to miscarry , although again researchers VBD this conflicted with most of the other NN that has been done . U.S. officials recommend that just about everybody over the age of 6 months should VB a NN NN every single NN . The NN strains circulating often mutate and the NNS are updated in an attempt to keep up . This NN the NN season is off to a strong start , with hospitals in some NNS already reporting their emergency rooms are filling up . So far , 13 NNS have died from NN . RB if the NN shot does not completely protect against infection , the NN shows that it greatly lowers the rate of NNS who die or VBP severely ill from NN . NN kills between 2,000 to 56,000 Americans every NN , depending on how bad the NN season is , and it puts 140,000 to 710,000 NNS into the hospital . For the NN in Spain , the team checked on 728 NNS 65 and older who were in the hospital with NN . Of these patients , 83 died . Patients who had not been vaccinated at all were more likely to need intensive care — 16 percent of them did , compared to 6 percent of those who had been vaccinated . And 14 percent of those who died had not been vaccinated , compared to 6 percent who had been vaccinated . The NN was 70 percent effective in preventing death . “ NN that occurred only in the current season did not show significant protection against severe influenza , ” the researchers noted . But repeated NN did . It ’s possible that NNS who VBP NNS every NN are healthier and more careful in other ways , Topham VBD . For instance , CD NN showed NNS who VBP NN NNS are RB less likely to have car accidents , he VBD . “ There is very little downside to getting your influenza NN , ” VBD Topham . “ I VBP my NN every NN . Everyone in my family does . ”"

Is the NN facing an explosion in the number of NNS with NN ? A respected researcher believes it is already happening . During a controversial conference late last NN in Groton , Massachusetts , Dr. Stephanie Seneff , a senior Massachusetts Institute of Technology NN scientist , VBD stunned audience members , “ At today ’s rate , by 2025 , CD in CD NNS will be autistic . ” As an expert in biology , Dr. Seneff has published 170 - plus peer - reviewed articles over the course of her career . As she spoke , Dr. Seneff exhibited RB more courage by blaming the alarming rise in NN on genetically modified foods and the use of Roundup pesticide agents manufactured by Monsanto . “ Is there a toxic substance that is currently in our environment in step with increasing rates of NN that MD explain this ? ” she asked . “ The answer is yes , I ’m quite sure that I ’m JJ , and the answer is glyphosate . ” Glyphosate is the active ingredient in Monsanto ’s Roundup weedkiller . To verify Dr. Seneff ’s claims about the possibility of such an exponential increase , this reporter contacted Dave Pantos , the executive director of the NNP Action Partnership . “ In 1990 , CD in 500 NNS was diagnosed with NN , ” VBD Pantos . “ According to a Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention ( CDC ) report issued in 2013 , that number rose to CD in 68 . Worse , for boys , the rate soars to CD in 42 . ” This reporter RB spoke with Wendy Fournier , NN of the National NNP Association , who clarified some of these statistics . “ The 2013 CDC NN stating that CD in every 68 NNS is diagnosed with NN was based on a NN of NNS born in the NN 2002 , ” VBD Ms. Fournier . “ Their figures are very outdated . Nobody RB knows the actual rate of NN in this country . We ’re certain of CD thing , though — the rate of those suffering from NN is rising . ” Obviously troubled by this trend , Ms. Fournier asked : , “ What ’s happening to NNS ? Why are so JJ chronically ill ? It ’s not possible that a genetic epidemic MD develop over the past CD decades , so there have to be JJ factors . More than 2 % of male NNS born in this country now develop NN . ” When the taboo topic of NNS came up during AMERICAN FREE PRESS ’s interview with Ms. Fournier , she did n’t hesitate in her response : “ I put credence in every possibility , including NNS and mercury . We VBP that NNS VBP NN . There ’s no question about it because court NNS have proven it . RB , some kids are genetically predisposed to toxins . What ’s VBG on inside their bodies , and why is it making them vulnerable ? We ’ve now reached a point where a second generation of kids is being lost to this disorder . ” Although this subject generally gets ignored by mainstream NN NN experts , within the next CD decades over 1.5 million of these NNS will age into adults with NN . Ms. Fournier realizes the dangers . “ This is a disaster , ” she VBD . “ What are we VBG to do with those at the lower end of the functioning spectrum , especially when their parents , the primary NN providers , die or are unable to tend for them ? These individuals will require around - the - clock attention for the rest of their lives . They ca n’t function , they ’re minimally verbal and most are incapable of self - care . ” RB before this fateful day arrives , Ms. Fournier sees another , more immediate concern . “ CD of the biggest medical issues being overlooked is co-occurrence problems , ” she VBD . “ Specifically , gastrointestinal [ GI ] difficulties are extremely common in NNS with NN . Really painful GI diseases VBP chronic constipation or diarrhea , which then create behavioral problems because these NNS can’t adequately verbalize what ’s affecting them . That ’s why we so often VBP aggressive episodes or self - injury . These underlying medical issues are n’t being addressed or treated . A majority of families are still struggling to receive proper early diagnosis . ” Despite billions of dollars being spent by governmental agencies on various studies , Ms. Fournier views their efforts as misguided : “ The Interagency NNP Coordinating Committee [ IACC ] , founded under the National Institutes of NNP , has failed us miserably . We ’ve brought all this NN to IACC , but they keep doing the wrong NN . All of our requests made over JJ NNS have been ignored by the NN ’s national NN agencies . ” Victor Thorn is a hard - hitting researcher , journalist and author of over 50 books ."

The websites for CD of China 's leading universities recently published academic NN about the origins of the NN . However , the studies were then deleted from both websites and scrubbed from the NN - controlled Internet , according to a report . In a possible bid to "" VB the narrative "" surrounding the NN , the posts on the websites of the China NNP of Geosciences ( Wuhan ) and Fudan NNP were erased from online caches , The Guardian reported . Wuhan 's NN appears to have published and then deleted posts about academic NN that needed to be approved by China ’s ministry of NN and technology before publication . Posts originally published on April 9 by the school of NN NN and technology at Fudan NNP in Shanghai were RB deleted in a similar apparent censorship effort . “ They are seeking to transform it from a massive disaster to CD where the NN did everything RB and gave the rest of the NN NN to prepare , ” Kevin Carrico , a senior NN fellow of Chinese studies at Monash NNP , VBD The Guardian . “ There is a desire to a degree to deny realities that are staring at us in the face … that this is a massive NN that originated in a place that the Chinese NN really should have cleaned up after NNP , ” he added . China ’s NN and technology ministry had announced on April 3 that academic researchers needed to report their NN findings to officials within three days or be terminated . The NN outlet noted that China ’s NNP Xi Jinping published an essay in March that included “ tracing the origin of the NN ” a national priority ; the NN and technology ministry referenced the essay shortly before the universities changed tunes . On NNP NNP ’s Eve , China informed the NNP NNP Organization of a “ mysterious pneumonia outbreak ” spreading through Wuhan , an industrial city of 11 million . The NN closed a seafood market at the center of the outbreak , moved all patients with the NN to a specially designated hospital and collected test samples to send to NN laboratories . Doctors were VBN to stay quiet ; CD who issued a warning online was punished . He later died of the NN . The Pentagon was VBN to have RB learned about the JJ NN in December from open - source reports emanating from China . By early January , warnings about the NN had made their NN into intelligence reports circulating around the NN . On Jan. 3 , the head of the U.S. Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention [ CDC ] , Robert Redfield , received a call from his Chinese counterpart with an official warning . Dr. Anthony Fauci , the NN ’s top infectious NN expert , VBD he was alerted to the NN around the same NN — and within CD weeks was fearful it MD bring about a JJ catastrophe . Quickly , U.S. intelligence and public NN officials started doubting China ’s reported rates of infection and death toll . They pressed China to allow in U.S. epidemiologists — both to assist the country in confronting the spread and to gain valuable insights that MD VB buy NN for the U.S. response . U.S. officials RB pressed China to send samples of the NN to U.S. labs for NN and for NN and test development . That same day , the National Institutes of NNP started working on a NN . Ultimately , the U.S. was able to VB China ’s consent to send CD NNS on the WHO team that traveled to China later in the month . But by then precious weeks had been lost and the NN had raced across Asia and had started to escape the continent ."

In 2014 , the NNP NNP Security Agenda had tapped Italy to lead NN NN strategies . But just four NNS later , the country has instead become the testing ground for anti-vaxxers , a movement growing across Europe and the US , and whose ideologies often share NN on the political landscape with populist parties . "" Ten obligatory vaccinations are useless and in JJ NNS dangerous , if not harmful , ” Italy ’s interior minister Matteo Salvini VBD , in the run up to the general election in March . The NNS epidemic in Europe as a whole is now at an eight - NN high . Mr Salvini , from the League party , and RB the country ’s deputy prime minister , shares something in common with other leading populists such as his European ally Marine Le Pen and US NN Donald NNP . As part of their anti-establishment views , they are RB choosing to target NN . The League and it ’s coalition partner , the Five Star Movement , both stood with anti-vaxxer groups during the electoral NN , promising to oppose the pre-existing law that made NNS mandatory . Soon after forming a NN , the JJ NN minister Giulia Grillo lifted the existing requirements by allowing parents to self - certify that their NNS have had the compulsory vaccinations , hitherto necessary for school admission . But the parliament then VBD the requirement to provide proof of vaccinations MD just be postponed until the 2019 - 2020 school NN . On CD side , anti-vaxxers now accuse the League and the Five Star Movement of betrayal . And on the other , confusion and legal uncertainty about compulsory NN has made the start of a JJ NN much more difficult for vulnerable NNS , such as those with suppressed immune systems . “ I ’m not ignorant , ” VBZ Anna Pettinarolli , from Genoa , the port city of northern Italy . “ I am a 35 - NN - old financial advisor who cares for her NN . I VBP that NNS can VB damage , and that ’s why I have been persuaded that parents have the NN to choose if they should vaccinate their NNS or not . ” Ms Pettinarolli is a board member of Comilva , the Italian Movement for Freedom of NNP – CD of the most well - VBN of all the Italian “ free - choice ” , or anti-vaccination associations . “ Our movement has grown over the last 30 NNS , and in particular in the last CD NNS , "" she VBZ . "" Do you VB to VB how JJ we are ? “ Take a look at the NN rate . Look at the percentage of unvaccinated kids , and you ’ll VB how big our numbers are . ” These numbers are exactly why the NNP NNP Organisation is so concerned about the rise of the anti-vaxxer movement in Italy ; the country ’s NN rate is far behind the goal . To stop transmission of infections , 93 - 95 per cent of the population should be immunised , the herd immunity threshold . But in 2015 , Italy ’s paediatric NNS NN rate was around 85 per cent for the JJ dose and 83 per cent for the second dose . NNS say that rather than becoming the leader in a JJ NN strategy , the country has become a black sheep . When NNS rates soared across Europe in 2017 , the number of NNS was three times higher than the NN before . The CD NNS with the highest number of NNS were Romania and Italy , with Italy accounting for 34 per cent of JJ NNS . And in a sample of 5,000 of these NNS , 89 per cent were unvaccinated NNS , according to the European Centre for NNP Prevention and NNP . In 2017 Beatrice Lorenzin , the former NN minister , reacted to the fall in vaccinations by introducing a law that obliged NNS under the age of six to undergo 10 routine NNS before enrolling in nurseries and pre-school . But this mandatory NN policy appeared to fuel the no-vaxxers protest – and populist movements capitalised on it . “ What Italy is seeing is not a vague sentiment , or parents ' response to some abstract concern about NNS . It 's the product of real NNS and specific facts , ” VBZ British journalist Brian Deer . “ This is principally the achievement of the disgraced former British NN Andrew Wakefield , and a group of enablers who work with him , aiming to destabilise public confidence in NNS . “ Embittered after he was caught falsifying NN NN , he can do this because of the opportunities provided by JJ NN . ” Mr Deer has become the unofficial debunker of the claims of anti-vaxxers . Twenty NNS ago , Wakefield published a NN in The Lancet suggesting an association between the MMR ( NNS - mumps - rubella ) NN and NN and gastrointestinal diseases . This paper is at the origins of parents ’ growing scepticism towards NN – but Mr Deer showed that Wakefield had manipulated evidence and had a conflict of interest . As The Lancet itself had to admit , the NN was “ JJ NN ” RB before the term was popular . Nevertheless , the JJ NN continues to be spread online , and public confidence in vaccinations continues to drop , and , as Mr Deer points out , the result is polarisation . As was the case with Donald NNP – who tweeted and claimed that NNS and NN are linked – at JJ Italian populists rode the wave of anti-vaccine sentiment in their election campaigns . On the other side , NNS are trying to adapt and react . Roberto Burioni , a professor of microbiology and virology at the Università Vita - Salute San Raffaele in Milan , is trying to use JJ networks to oppose no-vaxxers . “ The drop in NN rates made Italy comparable to Namibia or Ghana – that ’s unacceptable , "" he VBD . “ NNS are necessary for public NN : a high rate MD mean that RB NNS that ca n’t be vaccinated because of immunodepression can be protected from infections . “ I ’ll continue explaining this whenever I can . This has cost me lots of threats and intimidations from fanatics , too . ”"

It ’s VBG to be harder still if there is any reason for them to doubt the motives or the method behind the NN . With that in mind , I can VB CD potential trouble spots with Operation Warp Speed , NNP NNP ’s effort to leverage the full force of military , pharmaceutical industry and NN resources to develop a NN for NN - CD by the end of the NN . According to NN reports , NNP has tapped Moncef Slaoui , a former executive with giant pharmaceutical NN GlaxoSmithKline , along with a top Army general , Gustave F. Perna , to lead the effort . Slaoui clearly has the pedigree and connections for such a job . He has a doctorate in molecular biology and immunology and ran the NN development program for GlaxoSmithKline , where he worked for 30 NNS . But he ’s RB a venture capitalist who sits on a number of pharmaceutical NN boards , including those of CD NN makers , SutroVax and Moderna . Slaoui reportedly intends to step down from the boards to participate in Warp Speed , but that wo n’t erase a career spent deeply embedded in , and enriched by , the pharmaceutical industry . Putting him in charge of this effort gives ammunition to NN opponents to shoot holes in the public NN NN that will be needed to successfully immunize the public against the NN . CD of the most durable myths trafficked by so - called anti-vaxxers is that NNS are scams developed by greedy pharmaceutical NNS , abetted by a corrupt NN , to make money from substances that do more harm than good . These claims have been repeatedly debunked , and studies show that NNS are safe and effective . It ’s RB well documented that NNS have saved untold numbers of humans from suffering and death from NN . Nevertheless , the fiction spread by anti-vaxxers continues to circulate and take hold among well - meaning , if gullible , NNS . The disinformation campaigns have done real harm , too , helping drive down rates of childhood immunizations and leading to the recent resurgence of NNS in the U.S. and other NNS . And lord VB us if anything goes wrong with the NN - CD NN itself . Although NNS have been protecting NNS from deadly infectious diseases such as smallpox and influenza for centuries , they are n’t always benign and sometimes harm NNS they are intended to protect . The rush to develop a NN against polio in the 1950s had disastrous consequences . Some batches of the NN were VBN to be defective , but only after they had been rolled out in a mass immunization NN . The bad batches caused 40,000 NNS of polio , killing 10 NNS , leaving dozens more paralyzed and justifiably scaring the public about the safety of future NNS . That incident led to much tighter regulation for NNS , but it should stand as a good reminder that expediting NN development comes with risks . And the facts that the White House is calling the effort Operation Warp Speed , not Operation Save Lives , and aiming to produce 100 million doses by November suggest that the motivation is meeting an artificial deadline rather than developing a safe NN to protect the public against the NN ."

We just do n’t VB yet . In February , reports emerged of a woman in Japan who had been given the all - clear after having NN - CD but then tested positive for the NNP - CoV - 2 NN a second NN . There have RB been reports of a NN in Japan testing positive after being given the all - clear , and anecdotal NNS of second positives have emerged from China , too . This has raised fears that NNS MD not develop immunity to the NN . This MD mean that , until we have an effective NN , we MD all experience repeated rounds of infection . But the NN is still uncertain . “ There is some anecdotal evidence of reinfections , but we really do n’t VB , ” VBZ Ira Longini at the NNP of Florida . It MD be that the tests used were unreliable , which is a problem with tests for other respiratory viruses , VBZ Jeffrey Shaman at Columbia NNP in NNP York . Early signs from small animal experiments are reassuring . A team from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in Beijing exposed four rhesus macaques to the NN . A week later , all four were ill with NN - CD - JJ NNS and had high NN loads . CD weeks later , the macaques had recovered and were confirmed to have antibodies to the NN in their bloodstream . “ You can be infected with other coronaviruses over and over . We do n’t VB if that ’s true for this NN ” The researchers then tried to reinfect CD of them but failed , which suggests the animals were immune ( bioRxiv , doi.org/ggn8r8 ) . “ That finding is very encouraging , as it suggests that it is possible to induce protective immunity against the NN , ” VBZ Alfredo Garzino - Demo at the NNP of Maryland School of Medicine . But that does n’t necessarily mean JJ - term immunity . There are other coronaviruses circulating among humans and although they induce immunity , this does n’t last . “ Some other viruses in the NN family , such as those that VBP common colds , tend to induce immunity that is relatively short - lived , at around three months , ” VBZ Peter Openshaw at Imperial College London . “ Because [ the NN ] is so JJ , we do not yet VB how RB any protection generated through infection will last . We urgently need more NN looking at the immune responses of NNS who have recovered from infection to be sure , ” VBZ Openshaw . Other immunologists agree . “ Immunity to NN - CoV - 2 is not yet well understood and we do not VB how protective the antibody response will be in the JJ - term , ” VBZ Erica Bickerton at the Pirbright Institute in the UK . “ For ordinary NN infections , you do not VB lasting immunity , ” VBZ Longini . “ You can be infected over and over , and we really do n’t VB for this novel NN if that ’s RB true . ” Other infectious NN specialists are more optimistic . “ The evidence is increasingly convincing that infection with NNP - CoV - 2 leads to an antibody response that is protective . Most likely this protection is for NN , ” VBZ Martin Hibberd at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine . “ Although we need more evidence to be sure of this , NNS who have recovered are unlikely to be infected with NN - CoV - 2 again . ” NN Check newsletter VB the latest NN NN in your inbox every week newscientist.com / healthcheck"

( Greg Nash / Pool via AP ) Richard Bright , former director of the Biomedical Advanced NNP and Development Authority , arrives for a House NNP and Commerce Subcommittee on NNP hearing to discuss protecting scientific integrity in response to the NN outbreak , Thursday , NNP 14 , 2020 on Capitol Hill in Washington . ( Greg Nash / Pool via AP ) WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Despite White House claims , the U.S. still lacks a comprehensive battle plan against the NN in critical areas including masks , testing , treatments and NNS , whistleblower Rick Bright warned Thursday in testimony before a House committee . “ Our window of opportunity is closing , ” he declared . The nation MD face “ the darkest winter in modern history ” if the NN rebounds , the NN NN scientist VBD lawmakers . Bright ’s appearance came after his ouster last month as head of a NNP and NNP Services biodefense agency , an action he alleges was retaliation by the NNP administration . “ We need still a comprehensive plan , and everyone across the NN and everyone in America needs to VB what that plan is , and what role they play , ” he VBD the House NNP and Commerce Committee . “ There are critical steps that we need to do to prepare ... we do not still have enough personal protective equipment to manage our NN care workers ... we still do not have the supply chains ramped up for the drugs and NNS , and we still do n’t have plans in place for how we distribute those drugs and NNS . We still do not have a comprehensive testing strategy . ” At the White House , NNP Donald NNP VBD Bright looked IN an “ angry , disgruntled employee , ” and Bright ’s boss , HHS Secretary Alex Azar , VBD , “ Everything he is complaining about was achieved . ” “ So this is IN somebody who was in a choir and is now trying to say he was a soloist RB then , ” Azar added . NNP , VBD later , at a Pennsylvania medical equipment distributor , that the U.S. is ramping up production of NN - CD - related items and that his goal “ is to produce everything America needs for ourselves and then export to the NN , including medicines . ” Bright spoke in measured tones and rarely raised his voice during five hours of questioning . He did n’t question the fact that there ’s now an all - out effort , financed by billions in taxpayer dollars , to procure masks and other supplies , develop better tests and treatments and discover an effective NN . His point was that those efforts are n’t being fitted together in a coherent strategy that will VB supplies and medicines to where they ’re most needed to protect NNS and prevent shortages and price gouging . Asked by Rep. Joe Kennedy , D - Mass. , if administration officials have prepared the country for the “ moment we are in ” and the months ahead , Bright responded , “ I VBP we have a lot of work to do to be prepared . ” Rep. Frank Pallone , D - N.J. , asked if he should be concerned that Americans will have problems getting access to a NN when it ’s available . Bright responded , “ Absolutely , sir . ” Bright , a career official , alleges he was removed as head of the Biomedical Advanced NNP and Development Authority after repeatedly warning higher - ups the NN outbreak was VBG to be worse than the public was being led to VB . He VBD the breaking point came when he opposed a White House directive to allow widespread access to hydroxychloroquine , a malaria drug NNP was touting as an effective NN . The FDA recently warned against its use for NNP - CD , except in limited circumstances . But at the White House on Thursday , the NN was still bullish . “ We ’ve had tremendous response to the hydroxy , ” NNP VBD . “ So , a lot of NNS have sworn by it , and we ’ll VB . ” Republican lawmakers for the most part were careful not to attack Bright directly . But Rep. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma criticized him for continuing to collect his $ 285,000 salary while RB on sick leave for a spike in NN pressure , and now on vacation as he tries to straighten out his work situation . “ You ’re too sick to VB into work , but you ’re well enough to come here while getting paid , ” VBD Mullin . “ I have a hard NN understanding that . ” Bright VBD CD of the worst moments as he tried to raise alarms came when repeated efforts to jump - start U.S. production of respirator masks went nowhere . He recalled getting emails in late January from Mike Bowen , an executive at a medical supply NN called Prestige Ameritech , indicating that its N95 mask supply was “ completely decimated . ” “ And he VBD : ‘ We ’re in deep shit . The NN is . And we need to act , ’ ” Bright VBD . “ And I pushed that forward to the highest levels I MD in HHS and got no response . From that moment I knew that we were VBG to have a crisis for our NN care workers because we were not taking action . ” Following Bright to the witness table , Bowen VBD lawmakers he ’s a Republican who voted for NNP . He paused then , and added that he admires Bright . As part of his whistleblower complaint , Bright is seeking to be reinstated in his old job . A federal watchdog agency has VBN “ reasonable grounds ” that he was removed as a reprisal . HHS , Bright ’s employer , VBZ it strongly disagrees with his allegations and VBZ it reassigned him to a high - profile position helping to lead the development of JJ NN tests at the National Institutes of NNP . Nearly 85,000 NNS have died from NN - CD in the U.S. , representing more than CD - fourth of JJ deaths and the NN ’s highest toll , according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins NNP . Worldwide more than 4.4 million have been infected and about 300,000 have died . Bright ’s testimony followed this week ’s warning by Dr. Anthony Fauci , the NN ’s top infectious NN expert , that a rushed lifting of store - closing and stay - at - home restrictions MD “ turn RP the clock , ” seeding more suffering and death and complicating efforts to VB the economy rolling again . Eager to restart the U.S. economy , NNP has been urging NNS to lift restrictions , and JJ governors are doing so gradually , though consumers remain leery of VBG RB to restaurants , JJ events and sporting competitions . Bright , who has a doctoral degree in immunology , VBD the nation ’s path forward should be based on NN . The steps include : — Establishing a national testing strategy . The White House has urged NNS to take the lead on testing , RB as the federal NN pushes to make more tests and better ones widely available . NNP VBZ the U.S. has “ prevailed ” on testing through this strategy , but in Congress Democrats are demanding a federal framework to encompass the whole nation . — Doubling down on educating the public about basic safety measures such as frequent hand - washing and wearing masks in public places . “ Frankly , our leaders must lead by modeling the behavior , ” VBD Bright , in a not - too - subtle reference to a NN who conspicuously goes maskless . — Setting up a system to fairly distribute equipment and supplies that are scarce and highly sought . Eliminating NN vs. NN competition MD increase efficiency and reduce costs ."

The priest consecrates the bread , and then he consecrates the wine , and there on the altar the meal becomes the NN and NN of Christ . Then , just as Jesus broke bread and shared wine with the apostles at the Last Supper , believers rise from the pews , receive the host , eat it , and , CD by CD , drink the Precious NNP , putting their lips to the same cup . That last part does n’t happen these days . Churches are closed and services have been moved online , for CD , but the Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention has RB advised against it . Before the NN , William Ouweleen had drunk from such a cup countless times . A vintner in the Finger Lakes region of NNP York , he used to attend mass and receive communion at St. Matthew Church , in Livonia , where the Precious NNP in the chalice had been a blush - colored wine that he ’d made . Ouweleen runs a winery named O - Neh - Da , which makes sacramental wine that churches use to celebrate the Eucharist . The winery , which is next to Hemlock Lake — “ o - neh - da ” is the Seneca word for “ hemlock ” — is the NN - to for Catholics in the Northeast . When Pope Francis visited NNP York City , in 2015 , he used O - Neh - Da wine for a mass at Madison Square Garden . In contrast to regular wine , which might be made with extra yeast , tannin powders , and flavorings , Communion wine must be “ natural , from the fruit of the grape , pure and incorrupt , not mixed with other substances , ” according to Vatican instructions . So , last fall , Ouweleen , a self - described “ hippie ” who is fifty - eight and wears his hair in dreadlocks , did what he does every fall : he harvested forty acres ’ worth of grapes , trucked them to his winery , crushed them , and allowed them to ferment with no additives . ( Except , that is , for some added sulfites , just before bottling — a preservative sanctioned by the Vatican . ) By springtime , he had fifty thousand gallons of wine in his cellar . This NN of NN , he MD usually be filling fifteen hundred wine bottles per day , in order to deliver them to churches in NNP York and Pennsylvania , and to religious - goods stores as far away as Florida and Guam . But he is n’t doing that this NN , because it MD mean purchasing glass bottles to fill with wine that might not sell . Ouweleen does n’t VB when the churches will reopen . This past Friday , NNP NNP deemed houses of worship “ essential ” and asked all governors to allow them “ to open RB now , for this weekend , ” but , in NNP York , houses of worship can only fully reopen in the last phase of the NN ’s four - part reopening plan , along with stadiums and amusement parks . Ouweleen is RB not sure that , when they do reopen , they will continue to serve consecrated wine , which , in most of the country ’s Catholic churches , is drunk from a chalice that is shared by the entire congregation . So he decided to ask them . Last month , Ouweleen typed up a letter to the bishop in Albany , to ask if he had any foresight on the future of sacramental wine . A week later , still awaiting a reply , Ouweleen broadened his query , writing to more than a thousand parishes — all customers of his — to ask if they plan to distribute the Eucharist by chalice , once church services resume . In his letter to the priests , Ouweleen explained that O - Neh - Da had survived — by NNP ’s grace — several wars , the Great Depression , and Prohibition , but , “ the Good Lord helps those who VBP themselves , so we are taking an active role in planning for the other side of this NN . ” Ouweleen figured that the wine in his cellar MD last for about a NN before its taste started to fade . “ I ’ll VB what to do with that wine when I VBP what to do , ” he VBD . “ This graceful hand of the unseen has been very present in my NN , and I respect that . ” In the meantime , he continued checking in on his vineyard . By September , his vines will have produced CD hundred tons of grapes , which will yield another forty thousand gallons of wine . It was getting warm , and the vines were about to bud . There are three major sacramental wineries in the NNP NNPS : Mont La Salle and Cribari , both in California , and O - Neh - Da , in NNP York , which is the smallest and the oldest . Established in 1872 by Bishop Bernard McQuaid , the JJ bishop of Rochester , O - Neh - Da was originally run by seminarians , and , later , by monks . In 2002 , it was purchased by Steven Goldstone , who ’d recently retired as the C.E.O. of RJR Nabisco , the food and tobacco conglomerate , and who ’d seen a notice in the Wall Street Journal advertising a winery for sale in the Finger Lakes . ( Goldstone , a private pilot , liked to fly over the region in his plane . ) In 2007 , there was another ad — this NN , in the PennySaver , for a rental house on the O - Neh - Da Winery ’s property , which MD cost eight hundred and fifty dollars a month . Ouweleen responded to it ; he and his wife , Lisa Woodhams , and his stepson , Jacob , were facing eviction from their home in Conesus . The family was continuously hard up — Ouweleen was the manager of an organic market that was trying ( and failing ) to compete with Wegmans — and they were searching for a gentler , more Christ - IN NN . ( They wrote a prayer : “ Land with a view / a ridge line or CD … a place to grow / with maintenance kept low / sanctuary where / we reap what we sow . ” “ Divinity , ” it concluded , “ make it so . ” ) The rental , an old winemaker ’s house built in the twenties , with three bedrooms , and a lot of bats in the attic , felt fated . The family moved in and learned , upon their arrival , that the winery on the grounds was n’t doing too well . ( They had regular encounters with the winemaker , who kept knocking on their door , asking if they had any spare trash bags or light bulbs . ) Ouweleen was RB looking for a JJ job , so he called Goldstone and VBD him , “ I VBP I ’m supposed to be here to VB you with this winery . ” Goldstone flew north to meet with Ouweleen , who had prepared a PowerPoint presentation on what he described as the brand ’s “ natural assets , ” such as its JJ , almost romantic history of sequestered religious men ministering to its grapes . Ouweleen had no experience in wine - making , but , Goldstone VBD later , “ It ’s not IN I had a JJ line of prestigious winemakers waiting to be interviewed for the job . ” Goldstone decided , of Ouweleen and his family , that “ they belong there . ” The CD men worked out an arrangement in which Ouweleen MD run O - Neh - Dah . A NN later , Woodhams joined him . ( She ’d been bartending and waiting tables until she was sure that this sacramental winery gig was VBG to work out . ) Together with CD other full - NN employee and several part - NN staff , Ouweleen and Woodhams do the work of a hundred unpaid monks . Ouweleen plays Reggae for the fermenting grapes — “ conscious music , ” he VBD , “ to encourage them ” — and tastes and adjusts the wine . He RB fixes the bottle - capper , and the crusher , and the labeller , and the filler , and the air - compressor , and the tractor , when they break . Woodhams pays the bills , answers the phones , puts together wholesale orders , and coördinates the family ’s appearances at wine tastings . Friends VBP them bottle the wine . “ It ’s UH if a Catholic school lost all their nuns , ” Ouweleen VBD . “ It ’s noble but unprofitable work . ” This is true RB when there ’s no NN . ( O - Neh - Da charges about eighty dollars for a case of twelve bottles of sacramental wine , and the average church customer orders twenty NNS of wine a NN . ) But it has been a reliable source of income , which , for Ouweleen , feels nothing short of miraculous . In the spring , when the grapevines begin to sprout , the robins are loudest in the mornings and the woodpeckers are busiest in the evenings . In the fall , when the grapes are harvested — RB the Rosette , then the Delaware — the lake reflects the orange of the trees . Every NN is different but RB the same . The family has been able to count on it ."

Click_VB the_DT button_NN above_RB to_TO hear_VB Michael_NNP 's_POS essay_NN ._.","In December , 1962 , Esquire magazine established what it called its Dubious Achievement Awards . These were a series of fictional prizes given to celebrities , politicians , and business leaders who committed some egregious blunder that NN , a gaffe worthy of a kind of Hall of Shame . The annual event became so popular that readers and NNS hungered for it NN after NN . Now there are dubious awards everywhere , across all genres — movies , television , commercials . Every NN organization hungers to win awards . They display them in glass NNS in the lobby . They write stories about the individual winners . Your public broadcaster is no different . We love getting awards . The award season is about to begin , with various programs submitting entries to award - conferring bodies . Over the NNS , the CBC — radio and television — has received hundreds of plaques , statuettes , proclamations recognizing significant achievements in reporting and broadcasting . At the tail end of 2016 , we received an official looking envelope containing an official , suitable - for - framing , award certificate . Because of its importance , I VBP to read the official proclamation word for word : To wit - "" The 2016 Adding Insult to Injury Award , recognizing deception , distortion and dishonesty in NN , awarded to CBC Radio — The Sunday Edition . "" The award was presented by the Board of Directors of NNP Choice Canada . For those unaware of NNP Choice Canada , it is an organization opposed to the compulsory NN of NNS . Its argument is that ordinary vaccinations can neurologically wound NNS or kill them outright . It blames NN for seeming increases in NN spectrum disorder . It assiduously ignores the burden of evidence from the NNP NNP Organization at the top of the NN chain , down to your local family physician and pharmacist , that this is not the case . NN is CD of the most contagious and deadly diseases on the planet . It kills about 100,000 NNS every NN . What NN Choice Canada objects to is a NN we broadcast on last June on the backfire effect . I interviewed an American professor named Brendan Nyhan . He explained the backfire effect as the inability of JJ NNS to VB their opinions , RB after presented with irrefutable facts to the contrary . It matters not how JJ facts are marshalled to contradict them . They are resolute , RB reinforced , in their views . During the interview , Professor Nyhan used the anti-vaccine movement as another example of the intransigence of NNS holding views which are contradicted by evidence . With the anti-vaccine movement , it is especially difficult . As the NNP York Times pointed out in early January , the anti-vaccine group "" is not a bastion of rationality . "" Although NN after NN has demonstrated there is no link between NN and such diseases as NN , the anti-vaxxers continue their crusade . You have to be an automaton not to feel sorry for parents dealing with NN , who search for some explanation for their NN 's disorder . In desperation they turn to garbage NN and NN theories . The American Academy of Pediatrics has issued a 21 page document listing all the studies showing that there is no link between NNS and NN . Nevertheless , the arguments put out by the anti-vaxxers seems to be gaining ground in the NNP NNP , especially in the south and especially in Texas . Peter Hotez is a pediatrician with the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas . Dr. Hotez , writing in the NNP York Times , VBD that because the number of unvaccinated NNS is rising , there MD be serious outbreaks of NNS in his NN . It does n't VB things when the sitting NN believes that NNS VBP NN . Dr. Hotez VBD : "" I 'm worried that our nation 's NN will soon be threatened because we have not stood up to the pseudoscience and JJ NN claims of this movement . "" In 2000 , the US Centres for NNP NNP announced that NNS had been eliminated in the NNP NNPS , meaning it was no longer endemic to the US . Now it appears to be coming RB . Which means a renewed attention on the importance of NN and the skeptics who oppose it . So on behalf of The Sunday Edition , I humbly accept the 2016 Adding Insult to Injury Award , and give it pride of place in our office . Click the button above to hear Michael 's essay ."

But basically , these were futures contracts that rolled over . And so this was a phenomena that occurred over a 12 to 24 - hour period . So there ’s something a bit artificial about it . But it does reflect something that ’s real . Nobody wants the oil . It is not a precious commodity RB now because NNS are not driving , NNS are not flying , cruise ships are not cruising , and industry is not burning as much fuel as it was . And yet the NN is still producing this oil . That ’s JJ . So all of those things were done . But all that was accomplished , and it was something , was to stem the bleeding . And that brings us to the second trauma , which is the early NNS of the current century . When suddenly , our production is in decline again . China is growing by leaps and bounds . India is starting to grow by leaps and bounds . A middle class is growing around the developing NN . So demand is VBG up , UH , 5 million barrels a day around the NN . And the Middle East is suddenly more unstable . And so prices skyrocket between the NNS of about 2004 and 2007 . Economically speaking , no question about it . By 2014 , we were bringing down gasoline prices for consumers . It was part of our recovery from the recession . And all of this American production puts the NNP NNPS in a extremely powerful position economically , employing millions of NNS and producing revenues for NN and local governments across much of the country . RB giving the NNP NNPS the freedom to act in foreign policy in ways that MD have been unheard - of NNS before , such as putting pressure on Iran without endangering our NN supply . It was basically the culmination of the dream from the 1970s . And it was hard to imagine , just a few months ago , what MD happen that MD undercut that dream . So the oil has no place to VB . And it ’s rapidly filling up tank farms , strategic reserves around the NN . Refineries are running out of NN to put the oil . And so the inventories are building to a point where there ’ll be no physical NN to put the oil . You now have tankers which , you VBP , used to ship oil from place to place , just storing the oil and sitting out off of the shores of Los Angeles , for instance , and other places . And these are the NNS who are making a lot of money . They ’re getting paid to just hold the oil . Well , that ’s beginning to happen , but it ’s a cumbersome , complex process . RB of all , you have thousands of producers in the NNP NNPS . We do n’t have a national oil NN which is taking orders from the NN , such as in Saudi Arabia . And then there are complications that VBP along with shutting in wells . It ’s an expensive process . You can actually damage the resource to the point where , when you restart the oil , you ’ll actually pump less oil out . And then , you have all of these NNS that , RB when they ’re losing money , they need cash flow . They need cash flow to meet their payroll , to meet their debt responsibilities . So what oil NNS prefer to do , you let the well , basically , slowly decline ."

But when it comes to the NN crisis , uncertainty is unavoidable . Every day , we ’re bombarded with ambiguous , complex , and often conflicting NN . To make sense out of all this noise , the authors describe a framework for understanding different types of informational uncertainty . They then suggest several strategies for coping with that uncertainty , both cognitively ( to more effectively process and make sense of NN ) and emotionally ( to mitigate the stress and anxiety that result from uncertainty ) . Will colleges and universities restart in - person classes this fall ? Will there be a NN for the novel NN soon ? Will there be second wave of the NN ? Do I wear a mask outside RB if I plan to socially distance ? How can I figure out which NN sources and leaders to trust ? Every day we are faced with a torrent of NN from NN articles , cable networks , JJ NN , the White House , the Center for NNP NNP – and yet , there are no clear answers . As humans , we innately find uncertainty to be an aversive NN and are motivated to reduce it , RB at a cost . NN has shown that NNS are calmer and less agitated when they VBP they are VBG to receive an electric shock than when they VBP there is a 50 % chance they might receive an electric shock . Similarly , the threat of perceived job insecurity has more detrimental NN effects than actually losing a job . Feeling uncertain is not a natural NN of being for us — it signals to the brain that things are not JJ . The brain then seeks out NN to resolve the uncertainty . This desire for resolution is why feelings of uncertainty lead us to process NN more systematically and deeply in the hope of finding answers . But the NN NN leaves us in a quandary : Our natural instinct is to try to resolve our intense feelings of uncertainty , but there is so much uncertainty around the NN and its effects that a quest for complete resolution is futile . So what can we do ? RB , it is important to understand that uncertainty is multi-dimensional . There are at least three types of uncertainty : probability , ambiguity , and complexity . To cope with each , we have identified several strategies , both cognitive ( to more effectively process and make sense of NN ) and emotional ( to mitigate the stress and anxiety that result from uncertainty ) . Probability uncertainty refers to situations in which it is difficult to ascertain NN levels : Not only do you not VB what will happen , you RB do n’t VB how likely each outcome is . For example , how much am I really at NN compared to others in my group ? NNS of my age ? NNS where I live ? NNS who behave IN me ? As a cognitive coping mechanism , the JJ thing to do is to understand that you are at NN as much as any other member of your group . NN shows that NNS tend to underestimate their own NN of contracting a NN or encountering a negative event . This is a self - positivity bias , that needs to be overcome . Recognize that you are as much at NN as everyone else , and focus on what you VBP you can do to reduce NN by complying with expert recommendations ( e.g. , wash hands often , wear facial coverings in public , maintain JJ distancing ) . Do n’t be that person who gets yelled at in a grocery store for not wearing a mask ! Emotionally , it is important to embrace that you are at as much NN as the NNS around you and empathize with them on this common ground . Connect virtually ( or in person with appropriate JJ distance , if allowed ) with NNS you care about , whether they are friends , family or neighbors . Accept that we ’re all in the same boat and we ’re all doing our best to VB through this together . Ambiguity uncertainty refers to situations in which we are faced with imprecise , insufficient , or conflicting NN . For example , we were VBN that the NN MD be transmitted through hard surfaces such as cardboard , plastic , metal , etc . Now the CDC believes that the NN is mostly airborne and that the chances of contracting the NN through surfaces is very small . What does that mean for my behavior ? Can I VB the NN from not just someone ’s cough , but if they speak to me ? Is six NNS of JJ distancing enough to protect myself ? As a cognitive coping mechanism , consolidate the different sources of NN and try to VB clarity through what JJ NNS call triangulation ( i.e. , using multiple measures or methods to ensure that they all converge on the same result ) . Rely most on NN that is reported consistently through multiple reliable sources . But RB understand that the NN is novel , and that the NN around it keeps evolving . So sometimes we need to find a non-cognitive approach that does not involve trying to resolve uncertainty . Cope emotionally by knowing when it ’s NN to end the search for more NN . Sources such as the CDC warn against NN overload : “ Take breaks from watching , reading , or listening to NN stories , including JJ NN . Hearing about the NN repeatedly can be upsetting . ” Recognize that the endless search for clarity can create more stress than it alleviates , and sometimes enough is enough . This occurs when an issue is technically complex and difficult to understand : For example , for non-statisticians , it can be hard to understand what “ flattening the curve ” really means , why it ’s important , and how to balance different factors such as resource constraints , geographical variances , and JJ considerations . Is it true that a week ’s delay in lockdown in March led to a loss of 36,000 lives ? And now , how is each NN or county making the decision to reopen , and how are they balancing JJ loss against the loss of JJ NN ? As a cognitive coping mechanism , consult an expert source well versed in the field to break down complex NN into understandable nuggets . Make sure to find sources grounded in NN , not partisanship . And again , recognize when the quest for NN is helpful , and when it is n’t . Maybe what ’s needed RB now is not to understand the details of each epidemiological model , but instead to just understand what actions we need to take to be safe . Simplify the complexity into an actionable piece of NN ( e.g. , wear a mask when VBG outside ) . If this gets too overwhelming , cope emotionally by finding ways to escape the complexity : Re-watch a favorite TV show , knit a blanket , or organize your closet by color . Or if you can , escape your own stresses by making this NN a little less stressful for others : Donate to your local food bank , support your local businesses , or RB bail someone out of jail . Taking these steps to mitigate informational uncertainty will leave you with the mental bandwidth to cope with the JJ other important issues we all face . And in these trying times , it ’s best to take every chance you VBP to unwind and find some moments of zen ."

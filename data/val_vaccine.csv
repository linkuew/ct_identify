921,"Despite concerns by some parents that their children receive “too many vaccines too soon,” a new study finds that many shots, even on the same day, do not increase the risk of autism.

In the first six months of life, children receive as many as 19 vaccine doses of six different vaccines, and by the time they are 6 years old, a total of 25 doses from 10 vaccines.

• Beyond Vaccines: 5 Things that Might Really Cause Autism
• 10 Medical Myths that Just Won't Go Away

In a 2011 survey, about a third of parents expressed concerns that their child received too many vaccines before age 2, and too many vaccines on a single day.

Previous studies have found no link between the number of vaccines a child receives and their risk of several neurological conditions (though these studies did not specifically consider autism).

The new study went a step further by looking at the link between a child's total exposure to antigens — the proteins in vaccines that stimulate the body's immune system — and his or her risk of autism.

The researchers looked at total antigen exposure rather than the total number of vaccines kids received because, at the root of parents' concerns is the idea that ""somehow they provide too much immunological stimulation, more so than a young child's immune system can handle,"" said study researcher Dr. Frank DeStefano, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (The sheer number of vaccines would not be as good a measure of immunological response because vaccines contain different numbers of antigens, and some protect against more than one disease, DeStefano said.)

DeStefano and colleagues analyzed information from about 250 children with autism and 750 children without autism, born between 1994 and 1999.

Children with autism were exposed to about same total number of antigens as children without autism at ages 3 months, 7 months and 2 years. There was also no difference between the two groups in terms of the total number of antigens they were exposed to on a single day.

""Parental concerns that their children are receiving too many vaccines in the first two years of life, or too many vaccines at a single doctor visit are not supported in terms of an increased risk of autism,"" the researchers write in the March 29 issue of the Journal of Pediatrics.

Kids are exposed to many viruses and other pathogens that stimulate their immune systems in the same way vaccines do, and it's been estimated that kids could theoretically receive thousands of vaccines at once, the researchers said.

Although children today receive more vaccines than children in the mid-90s, the vaccines used today contain fewer antigens. So while children in the mid-90s were exposed to between 3,000 and 15,250 antigens in the first two years of life, children today are exposed to about 315 antigens, the researchers said.

534,"On April 30, the nation reported just four cases, all of them travellers arriving from abroad, marking the first day with zero local infections in two and a half months. As case numbers have continued to fall, the government has cautiously relaxed its guidelines, while signaling a shift to ""everyday quarantine"" measures, such as wearing masks and temperature checks at schools.

People's attitudes have also relaxed, leading some officials to worry about complacency and a second wave of infections. The nightclub outbreak may heighten those fears, but the government has already responded aggressively, tracing and testing thousands of people in a matter of days.

Last mile is the toughest

Though testing companies were quick to respond to the demand, rolling out the kits presented difficulties. Through February, demand for tests was still outpacing supply, and there were only enough kits to distribute to a select number of hospitals.

Furthermore, hospitals struggled to administer the tests to potentially contagious patients safely and quickly—testing areas needed to be sanitised after each patient, long queues meant the virus could spread while people waited in line, and health workers were running low on protective gear. At Yangji Hospital, this also led to exhausted staff, says hospital director Sang Il Kim.

""Even when we did have kits, the waiting times were just too long for everybody to get tested, so they would have to go to other hospitals,"" adds Yoona Chung, a doctor in the hospital's surgery department.

According to Yangji's data, the hospital was conducting roughly 10 tests a day by late February—but many more were being turned away due to the wait. Other hospitals in Korea started experimenting with drive-through testing centres, where patients could get tested without leaving their cars. But Yangji Hospital is near a subway station in a crowded neighbourhood in southern Seoul; for many of its patients, cars aren't an option.

So, Kim devised the walk-in booths, which went into pilot operation on March 10. Within days, the number of tests administered in a day had tripled. By the end of the month, the hospital could handle more than 90 patients a day. Hospitals elsewhere in Korea and around the world quickly adopted their own variations on the concept. A hospital in Busan had a similar idea independently but others have had help from Kim.",mainstream,M08f39,cancer; coronavirus; covid.19; drug.companies; population.control; vaccine.covid
538,"The FBI disproved its main theory about how the anthrax spores were weaponized.

The investigation of the 2001 anthrax attacks ended as far as the public knew on July 29, 2008, with the death of Bruce Ivins, a senior biodefense researcher at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in Fort Detrick, Md. The cause of death was an overdose of the painkiller Tylenol. No autopsy was performed, and there was no suicide note.

Less than a week after his apparent suicide, the FBI declared Ivins to have been the sole perpetrator of the 2001 Anthrax attacks, and the person who mailed deadly anthrax spores to NBC, the New York Post, and Sens. Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy. These attacks killed five people, closed down a Senate office building, caused a national panic, and nearly paralyzed the postal system.

The FBI’s six-year investigation was the largest inquest in its history, involving 9,000 interviews, 6,000 subpoenas, and the examination of tens of thousands of photocopiers, typewriters, computers and mailboxes. Yet it failed to find a shred of evidence that identified the anthrax killer–or even a witness to the mailings. With the help of a task force of scientists, it found a flask of anthrax that closely matched–through its genetic markers–the anthrax used in the attack.

This flask had been in the custody of Ivins, who had published no fewer than 44 scientific papers over three decades as a microbiologist and who was working on developing vaccines against anthrax. As custodian, he provided samples of it to other scientists at Fort Detrick, the Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, and other facilities involved in anthrax research.

According to the FBI’s reckoning, over 100 scientists had been given access to it. Any of these scientists (or their co-workers) could have stolen a minute quantity of this anthrax and, by mixing it into a media of water and nutrients, used it to grow enough spores to launch the anthrax attacks.",conspiracy,C0086a,vaccine
192,"A shot in the dark? Some say flu vaccine hard to find

Some parts of the country are experiencing spot shortages of flu vaccine because of increased demand in a flu season that started earlier and is more severe than previous years.

In Las Vegas, Celeste Tom tried six times before she found a flu shot for her boyfriend.

""I'd been bugging him to get a flu shot, but he kept putting it off,"" said Tom, 55. The Smith's Food and Drug Center where she got her shot was out. Her partner called his doctor's office, but they were out, too. Next she tried a Walgreens and then a CVS pharmacy; no vaccine. She called another Smith's, but it would administer vaccine only to people over 65. On Monday, she found a Walgreens that had 10 doses left. ""I called back when he got off work at 1 p.m. to make sure they still had some, and he finally went in.""

""The bottom line is there's vaccine out there,"" said Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""There may be places where there are spot shortages, but there should be a little bit more coming, so people may have to check around for it.""

It took Pam Copley a full day. The Staten Island, N.Y., mom, 42, tried her pediatrician, but the office had no appointments until February. She and daughter Colleen, 15, got in line at a CVS, only to have the nurse come and and say she didn't have shots for anyone under 18. After ""a bunch of phone calls,"" Copley found vaccine at an urgent-care clinic. They had to wait there for five hours, but it was worth it, she said. ""There's lots of flu in the schools here right now.

U.S. flu vaccine manufacturers have increased the number of doses they expect to produce this year to 145 million from previous estimates of 137 million, Skinner said. About 128 million doses have been shipped, and the ""vast majority"" of those have been used, he said. ""We had 112 million people vaccinated by the end of November.""

The CDC is working with the National Influenza Vaccine Summit, a coalition that monitors the flu and vaccine supply, to tell doctors and other health care providers which distributors and vaccine manufacturers have vaccine available to order, Skinner said.

""Spot shortages are not due to any manufacturing issues,"" said Rita Chappelle, a spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration. It's more an effect of a mild flu season last year and a more severe one this year. ""Demand for the vaccine is high.""

Ordering flu vaccine can be a challenge, said Cameron Wolfe with the division of infectious diseases at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, N.C. It requires ""pharmacies, physicians' offices and clinics to pre-order their supply, and given the variability in the flu season, it is always an educated estimate of what you'll actually need.""

There are two main vaccine producers in the United States, Sanofi US in Bridgewater, Conn., and GlaxoSmithKline in Upper Merion, Pa. For the 2012-2013 flu season GlaxoSmithKline, also known as GSK, produced about 25 million doses of flu vaccine.

All those 25 million doses of flu vaccine are spoken for, and shipping will be finished by early to mid-February, GSK spokesman Robert Perry said.

That doesn't mean there's no more flu vaccine available to doctors. Much of GSK's production goes to medical suppliers that take orders from doctors' offices, Perry said. The company had the capacity to produce more flu shots, but 25 million doses was ""what customers told us they would need,"" Perry said. In the past two years about half of Americans get vaccinated.

It's tricky to estimate how much to produce because flu vaccine takes six to nine months to produce, so manufacturers have to plan production before all the orders are in. GSK began taking orders for this flu season in October 2011. It will finish taking orders for next year's flu season next month. Health care providers base their estimates on previous year's demand. A single dose costs $7.90 to $8.85 wholesale, and doctors are careful not to order too much.

It's still not too late to get vaccinated. Flu seasons are unpredictable in their length, and it's unclear whether cases are still building or beginning to wane, according to the CDC. ""Being vaccinated with the flu vaccine each year remains the best way to prevent the flu,"" Chappelle said.

427,"Jeff Bradstreet, who has been described as a “controversial autism researcher,” has now become the center of conspiracy rumors after reports of his apparent suicide. His death is said to have followed on the heels of a raid by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of his Bradstreet Wellness Center in Buford, Georgia (update 27JUN2015: the Georgia Drugs and Narcotics Agency is reported to have aided in the raid). A fisherman found Bradstreet’s body in a North Carolina river on Friday, June 19. Authorities in Rutherford County, North Carolina, state that he had a gunshot wound to the chest, “which appears to be self-inflicted,” according to the local newspaper, the Gwinnett Daily Post. The Post also reports that

That speculation has spread like a virus through the community of people who are mourning the loss of a man whom they viewed as a courageous crusader against mainstream medicine and who believe, as Bradstreet argued, that the mercury in vaccines causes autism (the evidence emphatically indicates otherwise). According to his website, Bradstreet, whose own son is autistic, embraced a number of unproven or untested interventions for autism, including using stem cells in an overseas study he chronicles, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which the FDA cracked down on in 2013. He was known for his use of chelation therapy.

As I’ve written about here before, those who are attracted to conspiracy theories to explain their world have a tendency to see conspiracy all around them. With the death of Bradstreet, this tendency is emerging in force. A related fundraiser with the title “Finding out the truth” references an “exhaustive investigation into the possibility of foul play.” At last look, the funds raised were in the low five figures. Some seem to think that the location of the wound suggests foul play, but about a fifth of suicides by gunshot involve a wound to the chest. A handgun also was found in the river where Bradstreet’s body was discovered.

Studies of people who are prone to subscribe to conspiracy theories indicate that readers drawn to conspiracy-related online news tend to be more focused on what filters into their narrow, conspiracy-oriented communities, reinforcing confirmation biases and adding fuel to the conspiratorial machine. In the US, “conspiracist beliefs,” which are widespread, correlate with being more likely to use alternative medicine and to shun mainstream medicine, even to the point of being less likely to have an annual physical. Researchers call the internet a “natural medium” for the diffusion of conspiracy theories, and the rapidity with which this one spread and took hold is no exception.",mainstream,M08c0c,vaccine.autism
591,"by Ashley AustrewPoliticians aren’t exactly known for being honest. President Nixon had the Watergate scandal. President Bill Clinton lied about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. And, in the first two years Donald Trump was president, the Washington Post reported he’s made over 8,000 “false or misleading claims” to the American public.

Still, it is rare to see a headline declaring any president or politician a liar. Why is that?

First of all, what does it mean to lie?

The noun and verb lie are both recorded in Old English by the 900s. To lie is “to speak falsely or utter truth knowingly, as with intent to deceive.” More generally, to lie is “to express what is false, convey a false impression.”

So, when a person lies, they aren’t just sharing false information, they’re doing it with the sinister intent of getting others to believe misleading information. If someone does this habitually, then we would call them a liar, “a person who tells lies.” This word is also attested to in the 900s.

Why don’t journalists use the word liar?

The main reason why many journalists avoid accusations of lying is because it is difficult to determine one key word in that definition above: intent.

If a lie is “a false statement that is made with deliberate intent to deceive,” then calling someone a liar means you know they are intentionally trying to mislead people. While many of us make that assumption about politicians, it’s different when you’re a member of the media tasked with reporting the news—not your own conclusions about it.

David Greenberg, a professor of history and media studies at Rutgers University and a contributing editor at Politico, wrote in 2017 that the media declaring the president a liar would cross a serious line. That’s not to say that it should never be done.

Prior to the Watergate scandal, as Greenberg observed, a National Press Club report found Nixon guilty of “an unprecedented, government-wide effort to control, restrict and conceal information” and “discredit the press.” Still, it wasn’t until the Watergate story broke and investigations proved Nixon’s intent that the media declared the president a liar. If the media wants to retain their credibility, Greenberg argued, they are right to hold back from declaring President Trump, or anyone else, a liar. “Though it may seem fainthearted to use words like ‘falsehood’ and ‘untruth,’ in the long run the press will have more influence if it avoids insinuating more than it can confidently assert to be true,” he wrote.

Should journalists use liar anyways?

On January 21, 2019, the Washington Post reported that, in the first two years of his presidency alone, Trump made 8,158 false claims about the economy, immigration, trade, foreign policy, and other matters.

In just one instance in March 2019, Trump wrongly identified Patrick Moore, a man with early involvement in Greenpeace, as a cofounder of the organization in a tweet about him calling climate change “fake news.” Greenpeace was quick to correct Trump on the fact that Moore was not a cofounder, but that didn’t change the fact that many people were exposed to the tweet and may have accepted the president’s words as true.

Since the 2016 US presidential election, people have grown increasingly frustrated with the media’s treatment of public figures who lie, with many concerned that we live in a post-truth society where facts have become irrelevant.

And, it’s not only Trump. That election brought us the Hillary Clinton email scandal, during which Clinton said she “never received nor sent any material that was marked classified” on her private email server as Secretary of State—a claim that Politifact characterized as false.

During the 2016 presidential election, Politifact also found that 84 percent of claims Ben Carson, now Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, made since 2007 were false, including his assertion that there are a “multitude” of unnecessary vaccines available to the public. Texas Senator Ted Cruz told lies about 66 percent of the time in that time frame, including that “the federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls.”

Blurring the lines between fact and fiction even more, Trump has popularized the term fake news—not to call out actual fake news but to discredit anyone or anything perceived as unflattering to him. That strategy has been incredibly effective, and he has succeeded in creating an environment in which the truth is difficult to discern.

Many argue that the media simply can’t tolerate this level of misinformation anymore. Even journalists are starting to call one another out.

In January, Esquire published an op-ed by journalist Dan Sinker called “In 2019, The Media Has to Do Better in Calling Out Trump’s Sh*t [edited].” Sinker noted that journalists don’t use words like lie and liar because they’re supposed to maintain a level of objectivity. Nonetheless, he added:Of course, being objective doesn’t mean letting liars lie. “Balance” isn’t setting two pundits up to argue over what everyone knows is a false statement. There’s no bias in saying something is patently untrue if it is, in fact, patently untrue. In fact, saying things aren’t true from jump is kinda the most important part of the job.Some major news organizations have indeed been using the word liar in content. In August 2018, The New Yorker ran the headline “It’s True: Trump Is Lying More & He’s Doing It On Purpose.” In October, CNN published “Donald Trump Lies And He’s Doing A Lot More of It Lately.” The Atlantic joined the call-out in November 2018 with a piece simply titled: “The President’s Lies.”

In the era of fake news, publications have to contend with the fact that any escalation on their part (i.e., calling someone a liar), also comes with an escalation in the intense scrutiny the media is already facing. The media has the unique ability to speak truth to power, and that includes calling out politicians and not allowing them to get away with lies.

There may be disagreement on where the liar line should be, but that doesn’t change the fact that we need to draw one—even if intent is tricky to determine.

948,"It's midday at a busy pediatrician's surgery in Karlsruhe, a mid-sized town in the southwest German state of Baden-Württemberg.

A mother carries her sleeping child into the waiting room, while a sick baby screams so loudly that the receptionist has difficulty making herself understood on the phone.

Over in a corner, an assistant is preparing a combined measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox vaccination for the next patient.

She carefully puts a needle and a syringe on a tray together some medical swabs, and then removes the vaccine from the fridge. It still needs to be drawn and diluted before being injected.

The World Health Organization recommends that all children have two doses of the vaccine to ensure immunity from measles.

""All of my children have been vaccinated against measles,"" says Dr Dieter Knöbl from behind his desk.

Dr Knöbl, one of three pediatricians who work here, has been treating children in this surgery for 20 years. Before that he spent 14 years on the pediatric ward of the Karlsruhe public hospital.

He says he's seen so ""many children suffering from measles and many from measles complications"" that he always advises parents to vaccinate.

The measles complications Dr Knöbl is talking about include middle ear infections, pneumonia and measles encephalitis. The latter is an inflammation of the brain, which can cause permanent brain damage and even death.

Another complication is the quite rare but fatal disease with the unwieldy name of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). With SSPE, the virus slowly attacks the central nervous system.

""It's as if the children have Alzheimer's even though they are young,"" Knöbl says.

""As the disease progresses the infected children physically and mentally deteriorate. They can't speak, they are paralyzed and at the end, they just lie there and gasp for air. It is a wretched death.""

During his time working at the hospital, Dr Knöbl experienced three children dying of SSPE and one of pneumonia.

Measles complications are more common than many people think.

Of the nearly three hundred people who caught measles in an outbreak in Berlin in 2013, more than a hundred ended up in hospital - that's a hospitalization rate of more than 30 percent.

On average, one in a thousand measles patients will develop encephalitis. In western countries, about one in three thousand people infected with measles will die (the figure is much higher in developing countries, where added factors, such as malnutrition, can result in measles fatality rates of up to 30 percent).

To make matters worse, measles is one of the most contagious diseases on the planet.

But many refuse to vaccinate

Despite the risks, there are many parents who refuse to have their children vaccinated.

Some doctor's surgeries in Germany refuse to take on children who haven't had all their jabs, saying it's the only way to protect their other patients.

""That isn't our philosophy,"" says Dr Knöbl.

He and his colleagues believe that by turning away unvaccinated children the parents may deliberately seek out doctors who share their opposition to vaccination.

By keeping the parents coming to his surgery, he hopes there is a chance the doctors can win them over.

""In our experience, the younger the child, the more worried the parents are about vaccinating,"" Dr Knöbl says. ""But if you accept their fears and give them a bit of time, most of them change their mind.""

In 1998, the British medical doctor Andrew Wakefield alleged the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine caused autism.

Although Wakefield's study has since been discredited and withdrawn - and Wakefield has been struck off as a British medical practitioner - rumors of the link continue to abound.

In addition, there are parents who are unwilling to risk their children getting encephalitis, which is a rare side-effect of the vaccine.

At around a chance of one-in-a-million, the risk is considerably less than the one-in-a-thousand chance of developing encephalitis from measles itself.

But add these fears to the general public distrust of doctors, medicines and pharmaceutical companies - which is more pronounced in the southern German states of Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria - together with those who simply forget to bring their child for a follow-up jab and you have a significant number of children who aren't immunized.

In Germany, the measles immunization rate is 92 percent - in Baden-Württemberg it's even lower at 89 percent. This might sound like a lot, but it is well below the 95 percent goal set by Germany and other European nations to eradicate the disease by 2015.

In 2013, the then German health minister Daniel Bahr raised the idea of mandatory vaccination as a way of increasing the measles vaccination rate.

But Dr Günter Pfaff, the chief epidemiologist at the Baden-Württemberg State Health Authority isn't convinced that such measures would work in Germany.

""We probably would have to use more energy to fight against opposition to mandatory vaccination than we could use to convince people that vaccination is good, and that it would be a benefit for their children,"" he says from his office in Stuttgart.

For Pfaff, defeating measles in Germany is about minutely analyzing the data.

He turns around a giant whiteboard covered with a map of the state. It shows the measles vaccination rate for every health district. Some are dark blue - that's good because it means the vaccination rate is more than 95 percent. Others are light blue - which isn't so good.

""You can see there are a few communities, where there is quite a stark contrast between [them and] neighboring communities, and there is hardly another way of explaining this than that the practice of provision of medical services varies from town to town,"" he says.

One approach the state health authority (Landesgesundheitsamt Baden-Württemberg) is looking into is directly approaching doctors in villages and towns with low vaccination rates. It is something Dr Pfaff has tried in a few cases.

""What we [want to do] is ask the doctors 'did you notice that in your town vaccinations are much lower than in the neighboring village? And how come? We would like to draw your attention to this and we would like to talk to you about it,'"" he says.

Another approach they have been using is publishing the measles vaccination rates for villages and districts in community newsletters along with comparisons to neighboring places.

This kind of specific, local information has been found to help more than public information campaigns on a national level or in mainstream, national media.

Whatever the approach, it is possible to eradicate measles.

941,"Measles, also called rubeola, is a viral infection that's one of the most contagious infectious diseases in the world. The disease is marked by symptoms that are similar to a common cold, as well as a characteristic red rash. Between 2000 and 2010, the global incidence of measles decreased by 66% and the mortality caused by the disease decreased 74%, according to a report published in the journal The Lancet. Less than two decades ago, measles was almost wiped out in the United States, thanks to vaccines.

But recently, the virus has had a resurgence. Globally, the number of cases has jumped 30% due to vaccine hesitancy. More than 760 cases of measles were reported in the U.S. between Jan. 1 and May 3, 2019, according to Dr. Deepa Mukundan, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at the University of Toledo Medical Center in Ohio. This is up from 372 cases over the entire year in 2018 and up from 120 cases over the entire year in 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

How contagious is it?

Measles is caused by Measles morbillivirus, a virus in the paramyxoviridae family. According to the CDC, the measles virus settles in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person. When a person infected with the virus coughs, sneezes or exhales, the virus becomes airborne and can spread to other people.

""The virus can remain in the air for significant periods of time,"" Mukundan told Live Science. ""One can get the measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been, even up to 2 hours after that person has left.""

Indeed, the virus is incredibly contagious — 90% of people who are not vaccinated against measles will become infected if they share space with someone who has the virus.

""Another reason that it is transmitted so effectively is because the hallmark of measles, the rash, only comes several days after someone is contagious,"" said Dr. Jennifer Lighter, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at New York University Langone Health. Therefore, infected individuals can spread the virus for several days before realizing they're ill. The contagious period lasts about four days before and four days after the rash appears.

A person with measles is likely to infect between 5 and 18 unvaccinated people, according to a 2019 review published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Most cases of measles cause some combination of cough, runny nose, red eyes, high fever and tiny white to bluish spots in the mouth, said Dr. Aileen M. Marty, a professor of infectious diseases at Florida International University's Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine in Miami. As the infection progresses, the characteristic red rash will develop. The rash typically looks like large, red, flat splotches on the skin.

To test for measles, a doctor will examine the patient for telltale symptoms, such as spots inside of the mouth and the skin rash. If the doctor has any doubt, they may order a blood test to confirm infection, according to the Mayo Clinic.

Almost all cases require treatment by a doctor. ""This is a disease where complications are common — complications such as ear infection (acute otitis media), diarrhea and dehydration, pneumonia, encephalitis and even death,"" Marty told Live Science. ""In the United States, one to three of every 1,000 infected persons will die from [measles] complications — which is better than in the Third World, where as many as two to 15 per 100 infected persons die from measles and its complications.""

Young children are much more susceptible to the virus. According to the Mayo Clinic, measles kills 100,000 people a year, most under the age of 5. Pregnant women and those with a compromised immune system are also at risk of severe complications.

There is no specific drug for treating measles. Instead, doctors treat the symptoms. ""This means we provide/advise hydration, antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen) for comfort and fever control, airway humidification in patients with respiratory tract involvement,"" Marty said. Though not licensed in the United States for the treatment of measles, some pediatricians have used Ribavirin, an antiviral medication, to treat severe pneumonia caused by measles, Marty added.

To protect those who have been exposed to the virus but have not been vaccinated, a doctor may order a post-exposure vaccination. If given within 72 hours of exposure, the vaccination may prevent the measles. Even if it doesn't prevent the disease, the vaccinated patient will only have a mild case of the measles, according to the Mayo Clinic. Another way to protect at-risk individuals is to inject them with immune serum globulin (antibodies or proteins derived from the blood of donors with measles immunity) within six days of exposure to the virus. Like a vaccination, this treatment can prevent measles or make the onset less severe.

For many people, recovering from the measles includes resting at home until the symptoms subside. It is important for patients to drink plenty of fluids to replace fluids lost during fevers. It may also be helpful to use a humidifier to relieve congestion and to block out bright lights that may bother sensitive eyes, according to the Mayo Clinic. Once the disease has run its course, the person will be immune to the virus.

However, the immune system may be significantly weakened for up to 2 years after recovering from the measles, according to Lighter. During this time, people can be more susceptible to secondary viral and bacterial infections, which may cause more complications than the original measles infection.

The best way to prevent measles is by vaccination. The CDC recommends 2 doses of the vaccine; the first for those between 12 and 15 months of age and the second for children between 4 and 6 years of age. The vaccine is 97% effective for those who receive both doses and about 93% effective for those receiving one.

Getting the proper vaccinations not only protects the individual receiving the vaccine, it also protects those who cannot be vaccinated: those allergic to components of the vaccine, those with a compromised immune system or those too young to receive the vaccine.

""Vaccines are one of the most effective tools we have to protect public health and prevent deaths around the world,"" said Dr. Scott Lillibridge, an infectious disease expert and professor at the Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Public Health.

About 94% of the U.S. population is vaccinated against measles, according to Mukundan, although there are pockets of people who delay or refuse vaccines. The groups of unvaccinated people make it difficult to control the spread of measles, she said.

""All measles outbreaks in the U.S. start either with a visiting international traveler infected with measles or from an unvaccinated U.S. resident returning from an international trip with a measles infection,"" Mukundan said. The infection is then spread to others in the community who are unvaccinated.

Most measles cases occur in locations with groups of unvaccinated individuals, according to the CDC. In 2000, the U.S. declared that measles was effectively eliminated in the country. But since then, the disease has been making a comeback, likely due to anti-vaxxers.

""The antivax movement is a small percentage of the population but they are loud and draw a lot of undue media attention,"" Lighter said. Anti-vaxxers are driven by emotion rather than the science behind the vaccines, she said.

Modern opposition to vaccines is largely fueled by religious beliefs and the unwarranted concern that vaccines are somehow linked to autism, among other reasons, according to the Measles & Rubella Initiative, a collaboration of the world's largest health organizations that aims to eliminate measles and rubella.

Before the measles vaccine approval in 1963, an estimated 3 to 4 million people in the U.S. contracted the measles per year, with 400 to 500 dying from complications, according to the CDC. Introduction of the vaccine led to a greater than 99% reduction in measles cases in the U.S. A wealth of research has confirmed that there is no relationship between vaccines and autism and has repeatedly validated the safety of the measles vaccine.

""Protect yourself and your loved ones by making sure that they are up to date on the measles vaccine,"" Mukundan said. ""Prevention, meaning vaccination, is always better than cure.""

43,"This schedule of recommended immunizations may vary depending upon where you live, your child's health, the type of vaccine, and the vaccines available.

Some of the vaccines may be given as part of a combination vaccine so that a child gets fewer shots. Talk with your doctor about which vaccines your kids need.
• HepB: Hepatitis B vaccine. Ideally, the first dose is given within 24 hours of birth, but kids not previously immunized can get it at any age. Some low birth weight infants will get it at 1 month or when they're discharged from the hospital.
• HepB: Second dose should be given 1 to 2 months after the first dose.
• Hib: This third dose may be needed, depending on the brand of vaccine used in previous Hib immunizations.
• RV: This third dose may be needed, depending on the brand of vaccine used in previous RV immunizations.
• Influenza (Flu): The flu vaccine is recommended every year for children 6 months and older:
• Kids younger than 9 who get the flu vaccine for the first time (or who have only had one dose before July 2019) will get it in 2 separate doses at least a month apart.
• Those younger than 9 who have had at least 2 doses of flu vaccine previously (in the same or different seasons) will only need 1 dose.
• Kids older than 9 need only 1 dose.
• The vaccine is given by injection with a needle (the flu shot) or by nasal spray. Both types of vaccine can be used this flu season (2019–2020) because they seem to work equally well. Your doctor will recommend which to use based on your child's age and general health. The nasal spray is only for healthy people ages 2–49. People with weak immune systems or some health conditions (such as asthma) and pregnant women should not get the nasal spray vaccine.
• HepA: Hepatitis A vaccine; given as 2 shots at least 6 months apart
• HPV: Human papillomavirus vaccine, given in 2 shots over a 6- to 12-month period. It can be given as early as age 9. For teens and young adults (ages 15–26 in girls and boys both), it is given in 3 shots over 6 months. It's recommended for both girls and boys to prevent genital warts and some types of cancer.
• Tdap: Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis booster. Also recommended during each pregnancy a woman has.
• Meningococcal conjugate vaccine: And a booster dose is recommended at age 16.
• Meningococcal B vaccine (MenB): The MenB vaccine may be given to kids and teens in 2 or 3 doses, depending on the brand. Unlike the meningococcal conjugate vaccine, which is recommended, the decision to get the MenB vaccine is made by the teens, their parents, and the doctor.
• HepA can be given as early as 6 months of age to babies who will travel to a place where hepatitis A is common (they will still need routine vaccination after their first birthday). It's also recommended for older kids who did not get it in the past.
• The MMR vaccine can be given to babies as young as 6 months old if they will be traveling internationally. These children should still get the recommended routine doses at 12–15 months and 4–6 years of age, but can get the second dose as early as 4 weeks after the first if they will still be traveling and at risk.
• The flu vaccine is especially important for kids who are at risk for health problems from the flu. High-risk groups include, but aren't limited to, kids younger than 5 years old and those with chronic medical conditions, such as asthma, heart problems, sickle cell disease, diabetes, or HIV.
• Pneumococcal vaccines can be given to older kids (age 2 and up) who have conditions that affect their immune systems, such as asplenia or HIV infection, or other conditions, like a cochlear implant, chronic heart disease, or chronic lung disease.
• The meningococcal vaccines can be given to kids as young as 8 weeks old (depending on the vaccine brand) who are at risk for a meningococcal infection, such as meningitis. This includes children with some immune disorders. Kids who live in (or will travel to) countries where meningitis is common, or where there is an outbreak, also should get the vaccine.

885,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are fronting a new campaign looking at mental health issues amid the coronavirus pandemic.

They have been interviewed on the BBC about the scheme - called Every Mind Matters.

Here is the transcript.

Q: How are you helping get the message out there with Every Mind Matters?

Duke of Cambridge: So Every Mind Matters obviously is in its second guise now coming out - we got a lot of feedback from the NHS and from others that people were accessing the online plan, so we felt very strongly that now more than ever this was a vital tool and a vital service that people could easily access at home to guide them and give them just some very basic tips to mind their mental health, to mind their mental wellbeing through this process. I think again staying connected, staying positive and being able to talk to friends and family is so crucial and having just some tips and some ideas as to how to tackle some of these strange feelings and difficult circumstances we’re finding ourselves in is really important, just to nudge us through these next few weeks.

Duke of Cambridge: What I’ve heard as well Tina is about the fact that in many of these cases obviously NHS workers, frontline workers are used to dealing sadly with very sad situations, death and things like that but I think the scale and the speed of what’s going on in hospitals, bearing in mind also the isolation, a lot of these patients are dying with no family members around them. I think for the NHS frontline workers that is very difficult, because they are there right next to the bedsides, looking after and caring for each and every patient in a critical condition and I think they take away that pain and that sometimes that fear and loneliness that these patients have to go through, they’re the ones who absorb that and take it home to their families and I think again, I’ve spoken about the attrition and the daily attrition rate of that happening to somebody is not normal and we’re not super human any of us, so to be able to manage those emotions and that feeling is going to take some time after all this is over as well.

Q: Do you think this will fundamentally change who we are and what we value?

Duchess of Cambridge: Yeah, absolutely, I think what we’re saying now is the NHS and the frontline workers are doing the most extraordinary job and that’s really come to the forefront in the last few weeks and I think it’s going to dramatically change how we all value and see our frontline workers and I think that is one of the main positives that you can take from this. They do an extraordinary job it does unrecognised daily and now I think all of us as a nation can really see how hard they work and how vital their work is.",mainstream,M0a379,vaccine
1248,"Days after it was revealed in an intercepted human intelligence report that Bill Gates offered $10 million bribe for a forced Coronavirus vaccination program in Nigeria, now an Italian politician has demanded the arrest of Bill Gates in the Italian parliament.

Sara Cunial, the Member of Parliament for Rome denounced Bill Gates as a “vaccine criminal” and urged the Italian President to hand him over to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. She also exposed Bill Gates’ agenda in India and Africa, along with the plans to chip the human race through the digital identification program ID2020.

As reported by GreatGameIndia earlier, in 2015 it were the Italians who exposed secret Chinese biological experiments with Coronavirus.

The video, which was broadcast in November, 2015, showed how Chinese scientists were doing biological experiments on a SARS connected virus believed to be Coronavirus, derived from bats and mice, asking whether it was worth the risk in order to be able to modify the virus for compatibility with human organisms.

In an extraordinary seven-minute speech met with wide applause, Sara Cunial, the Member of Parliament for Rome said that Italy had been subjected to a “Holy Inquisition of false science.”

She roundly criticized the unnecessary lockdown imposed on her fellow Italians in the service of a globalist agenda.

She urged fellow political leaders to desist in any plans to compel citizens to surrender themselves to compulsory COVID-19 vaccination at the hands of the corrupt elite – whom she identified as the Deep State.

Hobbes said that absolute power does not come from an imposition from above but by the choice of individuals who feel more protected renouncing to their own freedom and granting it to a third party.

With this, you are going on anesthetizing the minds with corrupted Mass Media with Amuchina (a brand of disinfectant promoted by Mass Media) and NLP, with words like “regime”, “to allow” and “to permit”, to the point of allowing you to regulate our emotional ties and feelings and certify our affects.

So, in this way, Phase 2 is nothing else than the persecution/continuation of Phase 1 – you just changed the name, as you did with the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). We have understood people, for sure, don’t die for the virus alone.

So people will be allowed to die and suffer, thanks to you and your laws, for misery and poverty. And, as in the “best” regimes, the blame will be dropped only on citizens. You take away our freedom and say that we looked for it. Divide et Impera (Divide and Rule).

It is our children who will lose more, who are ‘raped souls’, with the help of the so-called “guarantor of their rights” and of CISMAI (Italian Coordination of Services against Child Abuse).

In this way, the right to school will be granted only with a bracelet to get them used to probation, to get them used to slavery – involuntary treatment and to virtual lager. All this in exchange for a push-scooter and a tablet.

All to satisfy the appetites of a financial capitalism whose driving force is the conflict of interest, conflict well represented by the WHO, whose main financier is the well-known “philanthropist and savior of the world” Bill Gates.

We all know it, now. Bill Gates, already in 2018, predicted a pandemic, simulated in October 2019 at the “Event 201”, together with Davos (Switzerland). For decades, Gates has been working on Depopulation policy and dictatorial control plans on global politics, aiming to obtain the primacy on agriculture, technology and energy.

Gates said, I quote exactly from his speech:

“If we do a good job on vaccines, health and reproduction, we can reduce the world population by 10-15%. Only a genocide can save the world”.

With his vaccines, Gates managed to sterilize millions of women in Africa. Gates caused a polio epidemic that paralyzed 500,000 children in India and still today with DTP, Gates causes more deaths than the disease itself.

And he does the same with GMOs designed by Monsanto and “generously donated” to needy populations.

All this while he is already thinking about distributing the quantum tattoo for vaccination recognition and mRNA vaccines as tools for reprogramming our immune system. In addition, Gates also does business with several multinationals that own 5G facilities in the USA.

On this table there is the entire Deep State in Italian sauce: Sanofi, together with GlaxoSmithKline are friends of the Ranieri Guerra, Ricciardi, and of the well-known virologist that we pay 2000 Euro every 10 minutes for the presentations on Rai (Italian state TV. She’s probably talking about Burioni).

Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline sign agreements with medical societies to indoctrinate future doctors, making fun of their autonomy of judgment and their oath.

Hi-Tech multinationals, like the Roman Engineering which is friend of the noble Mantoan, or Bending Spoons, of Pisano, which are there for control and manage our personal health datas in agreement with the European Agenda ID2020 of electronic identification, which aims to use mass vaccination to obtain a digital platform of digital ID.

This is a continuation of the transfer of data started by Renzi to IBM. Renzi, in 2016, gave a plus 30% to Gates Global Fund.

On the Deep State table there are the people of Aspen, like the Saxon Colao, who with his 4-pages reports, paid 800 Euros/hour, with no scientific review, dictates its politics as a Bilderberg general as he is, staying away from the battlefield.

The list is long. Very long. In the list there is also Mediatronic, by Arcuri and many more.

The Italian contribution to the International Alliance Against Coronavirus will be of 140 million Euros, of which 120 million Euros will be given to GAVI Alliance, the non-profit by Gates Foundation.

They are just a part of the 7.4 billion Euro fund by the EU to find a vaccine against Coronavirus – vaccines which will be used as I said before.

No money, ofcourse for serotherapy, which has the collateral effect of being super cheap.

No money for prevention, a real prevention, which includes our lifestyles, our food and our relationship with the environment.

The real goal of all of this is total control. Absolute domination of human beings, transformed into guinea pigs and slaves, violating sovereignty and free will.

All this thanks to tricks/hoax disguised as political compromises.

While you rip up the Nuremberg Code with involuntary treatment, fines and deportation, facial recognition and intimidation, endorsed by dogmatic scientism – protected by our “Multi-President” of the Republic who is real cultural epidemic of this country.

We, with the people, will multiply the fires of resistance in a way that you won’t be able to repress all of us.

I ask you, President, to be the spokesperson and give an advice to our President Conte: Dear Mr. President Conte, next time you receive a phone call from the philanthropist Bill Gates forward it directly to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. If you won’t do this, tell us how we should define you, the “friend lawyer” who takes orders from a criminal.

712,"Humans may be to blame for rising mercury levels in a species of fish that's very popular as food, according to a news study published this week. Levels of a potentially poisonous form of the element have been creeping up in Pacific yellowfin tuna 3.8 percent every year since 1998, according to a report discussed an article by the Los Angeles Times.

Methyl Mercury levels in tuna and other large fish have been a public health concern for some time. Health authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration recommend that young children, as well as women who are either pregnant or nursing limit their intake of tuna, and avoid other large species entirely, including swordfish and tilefish.

The study adds to evidence suggesting that human activity—particularly the burning of coal—is causing a buildup of the element in the air and water that is subsequently making its way into the food chain, according to an article in the Los Angeles Times discussing the research. Some fishing industry groups have long maintained that mercury levels in tuna and large fish are stable and come from natural sources, such as deep ocean vents.

Yellowfin—sometimes called ahi tuna—is sold in steaks and eaten in sushi, and can be sometimes found in small amounts in canned light tuna. The fact that the fish are not top-level predators could indicate that a broader swath of ocean life may be accumulating mercury levels that would make them hazardous to human health, if eaten.

""What this number is saying is that the amount of mercury in fish is getting higher and higher all the time, and if it keeps going like that, at some point, most every kind of fish is going to be potentially hazardous,"" study coauthor Carl Lamborg told the Los Angeles Times. ""Where that point is, I don't know.""

President Clinton Unveils Millennium Initiative to Promote Delivery of Existing Vaccines 

in Developing Countries and Accelerate Development of New Vaccines In his State of the Union address, President Clinton will call for concerted international action to combat infectious diseases in developing countries. These diseases cause almost half of all deaths worldwide of people under age 45, killing over eight million children each year and orphaning millions more. The President committed the United States to addressing this terrible problem in his September speech to the United Nations General Assembly. Now the President is asking for foundations, pharmaceutical companies, international agencies, and other governments to join us in this task, and he is announcing these specific elements of his Millennium Initiative:
• A new financial commitment to purchase and deliver existing vaccines in poor countries. As Vice President Gore told the U. N. Security Council earlier this month, the Administration�s FY 2001 budget will include a proposed $50 million contribution to the vaccine purchase fund of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI).
• Increased investments in health in developing countries. The President is calling on the World Bank and other multilateral development banks to dedicate an additional $400 million to $900 million annually of their low-interest-rate loans to expand immunization, prevent and treat infectious diseases, and build effective delivery systems for other basic health services. These investments are as central to economic progress as investments in education and physical infrastructure, and they would build on the new focus on basic health services that we have supported as part of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt initiative. This proposed shift in existing resources does not require additional U.S. budget expenditures.
• A significant increase in basic research on diseases that affect developing nations. The Administration�s FY 2001 budget for the National Institutes of Health includes a sharp step-up in research critical to the development of vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS.
• A new tax credit for sales of vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS to accelerate the invention and production of these vaccines. Because developing countries often cannot afford to buy vaccines, the market provides little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines for diseases that disproportionately affect those countries. This tax credit would provide such an incentive, because every dollar paid by a qualifying organization to buy a qualifying vaccine would be matched by a dollar of tax credits � representing up to $1 billion of additional funding for future vaccine purchases. The President is calling on other governments to make similar purchase commitments, so that we can ensure a future market for these critically needed vaccines. Infectious Diseases Pose a Mounting Social and Economic Burden on Developing Countries � And a Threat to Our Health As Well.
• More than eight million children die each year of centuries-old diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, and respiratory and diarrheal diseases. Deaths from the modern scourge of AIDS are climbing rapidly. Altogether, as many children die of infectious diseases each year as the total number of combatants who perished in World War I.
• In an interconnected and highly mobile world, health crises in other countries are a threat to everyone. We have seen this with HIV/AIDS, with the resurfacing of tuberculosis, and with the outbreak last year of West Nile encephalitis in New York. According to the Global Health Council, during the past 50 years, at least five times as many Americans have died from communicable diseases that have come from the developing world than have died in military conflicts. Vaccines Are One of the Most Cost-Effective Ways to Improve the Well-Being and Productivity of the Poorest Countries � And Medicines and Other Basic Health Services Are a Necessary Complement.
• It costs about $17 to immunize a child, but millions of children die each year of diseases that could be prevented by existing vaccines. Indeed, children in developing nations are 10 times more likely to die of a vaccine-preventable disease than children in developed nations. And these tragedies occur in spite of the enormous efforts of UNICEF and others to vaccinate children, which save 3 million lives each year.
• Highly effective vaccines do not yet exist for malaria, TB and AIDS, which take over 5 million lives each year. But developed nations have the scientific and technological capacity to make new vaccines possible. For example, recent work on genetic sequencing, including the human genome, will open vast possibilities.
• Another health investment with very high returns is simple preventive and curative services. Providing this basic health care together with vaccines would save millions of lives each year. A $50 Million Contribution to GAVI to Buy Vaccines For Children � Which Will Save Lives Now and Create Confidence that a Market for New Vaccines Will Exist in the Future.
• GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, was formed as a collaborative effort of UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, private foundations, bilateral aid agencies (including the U.S. Agency for International Development), industry representatives, and developing countries. GAVI established the �Global Fund for Children�s Vaccines� with an initial grant of $750 million over 5 years from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The formal launch of GAVI, and the official announcement of the Gates gift, will occur shortly in Davos, Switzerland.
• A U.S. contribution will help to purchase vaccines for Hepatitis B, Haemophilus Influenzae B (Hib), and Yellow Fever, along with related safe delivery equipment such as auto-destruct syringes. To ensure that GAVI�s vaccine purchases complement, rather than replace, existing vaccination efforts, they will be conditional on a country achieving 50 percent coverage of the DTP (diptheria-tetanus-pertussis) vaccine, which is included along with measles and polio in the existing EPI (Expanded Program for Immunization).
• A U.S. contribution will hopefully catalyze significant contributions from other countries and foundations. It will also add crucial credibility to the international community�s commitment to provide a market for new vaccines when they are developed. We Must Shift Existing International Resources Toward Building Health Infrastructure in Poor Countries That Can Deliver Vaccines and Medicines and Provide Essential Basic Health Services.
• The World Bank and other multilateral development banks (MDBs, such as the African Development Fund) lend money on highly favorable terms to the world�s poorest countries. Today, roughly $1 billion to $1-1/2 billion of this so-called � concessional funding� is devoted to health care each year. The Administration proposes to increase that amount by $400 million to $900 million per year, with a focus on:
• prevention of diseases using basic measures such as information and condoms for AIDS, treated bed nets for malaria, and stronger systems for containing TB;
• treatment of diseases, including common respiratory and diarrheal infections; and
• The Administration is exploring ways to use the HIPC debt reform to support this part of the Millennium Initiative. One possibility is to make an increase in vaccination rates one of the performance targets monitored in the HIPC progress reports. This could be accompanied by debtor countries� agreements to include specific improvements in vaccine delivery systems as priority uses of debt relief proceeds. We also expect that all Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers that are prepared for HIPC candidates will discuss the adequacy of budget resources and suggested policy reforms devoted to basic health care.
• This re-direction of resources supports the Administration�s overall strategy for global development, which emphasizes poverty reduction and gives a central role to �global public goods� � like health or the environment � in which positive actions taken in one country benefit other countries as well. To meet this objective, these funds should not come from spending on other basic social programs, such as education and health care.
• This aspect of the Millennium Initiative does not require a new budgetary commitment by the United States (or other donor countries). However, the U.S. ability to influence the direction of MDB lending and the use of HIPC proceeds depends crucially on meeting our existing commitments to these aid programs. We will work with other G-8 finance and development ministries to refine this proposal.
• A conservative estimate suggests that if basic health care including immunization were made broadly available, up to 2 million children�s lives could be saved each year. Higher Funding for Basic Scientific Research Through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Elsewhere Will Hasten the Development of Vaccines for Malaria, TB, and AIDS.
• The Administration�s FY 2001 budget for NIH includes a significant increase in research critical to creating vaccines for these diseases. For malaria and TB, this increase will build on recent advances in the genetic sequencing of these diseases, which have set the stage for major breakthroughs in vaccine development.
• Funding for NIH malaria vaccine research will increase more than 10 percent over the FY 2000 level. Future research will range from pre-clinical studies aimed at improving our understanding of the malaria parasite, through the development of vaccine candidates, to clinical trials judging vaccine efficacy and safety. NIH will also expand its collaboration with scientists in malaria-endemic regions, especially in Africa, to strengthen those regions� capacity for conducting clinical trials of malaria vaccines in the future.
• NIH research on a tuberculosis vaccine will receive over 40 percent more funding than in FY 2000 and more than double the FY 1999 level. NIH will focus on studying the body�s defense mechanisms against TB, and developing and studying vaccine candidates. Through its Tuberculosis Research Unit, NIH supports an international multi-disciplinary team to translate advances in basic research into new tools for fighting TB.
• NIH funding for AIDS vaccine research will increase substantially in FY 2001 and will have more than doubled since FY 1997. These additional resources will allow NIH to accelerate basic research on developing vaccine candidates and to significantly expand testing of potential vaccine candidates in both developing and developed countries. The new Vaccine Research Center on the NIH campus, which will be occupied this summer, will receive a sizeable increase in funding for the development and pre-clinical testing of HIV vaccine candidates.
• The Administration is providing strong support for the path-breaking research on infectious diseases being conducted by U.S. military scientists, including the opening (in October 1999) of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research/Naval Medical Research Center. Working in close collaboration with scientists worldwide, military scientists have developed and tested successful vaccines against Japanese encephalitis and hepatitis A � and they are working to create vaccines and medicines to protect service people, travelers, and millions of others from malaria, HIV/AIDS, and other infectious diseases. A New Tax Credit Would Effectively Provide Up to $1 Billion for Future Vaccine Purchases, Speeding the Invention and Production of New Vaccines.
• Current tax law provides substantial incentives for pharmaceutical research and development, including the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit, the orphan drug tax credit, and an enhanced deduction for charitable contributions of certain products. Nonetheless, pharmaceutical companies may be reluctant to invest in developing vaccines for diseases that primarily afflict people in poor countries, because little or no paying market exists in those countries.
• Under the proposal, the seller of a qualified vaccine could claim a tax credit equal to 100 percent of the amount paid by a qualifying organization that received a �credit allocation� by the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID). The tax credit would match the qualified organizations� expenditures dollar-for-dollar, thereby doubling their purchasing power. A qualifying vaccine would be a new vaccine that received FDA approval for use against malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, or any infectious disease that causes over 1 million deaths annually worldwide.
• For 2002 through 2010, AID could designate up to $1 billion of vaccine sales as eligible for the credit. This tax credit would be limited to new vaccines developed to fight these terrible diseases. The credit would provide a specific and credible commitment to purchase future vaccines at reasonable prices. Together with similar commitments from foundations and other governments, it would provide a critical and powerful incentive to accelerate vaccine research and development.",mainstream,M0a608,vaccine
462,"The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is not linked to development of autism spectrum disorders, even among children considered to be at risk, a large new study finds.

Among nearly 100,000 children, receipt of the MMR vaccine did not increase the risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), regardless of whether kids were at higher risk because an older sibling already had the condition, researchers write in JAMA.

""Even for children who are high-risk, the vaccine does not play a role,"" said lead author Dr. Anjali Jain of healthcare consulting firm The Lewin Group in Falls Church, Virginia. ""We don’t know what does unfortunately, but it’s not the MMR vaccine.""

The results should be reassuring, she said.

Autism spectrum disorder is a range of symptoms that often includes difficulties with communication and social interaction, according to the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health. It's may also include restricted and repetitive behaviors.

The 1998 study that claimed to find a connection between the MMR vaccine and ASD was later debunked. The Lancet, the medical journal that originally published it, withdrew it. Studies continue to vouch for the safety of the vaccine.

Still, some people continue to believe that the vaccine is connected to ASD.

Parents of children with ASD may also believe there is a genetic component, and so they decline to vaccinate their other children, Jain and colleagues noted in their report in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

For the new study, the researchers used insurance claims data on 95,727 children followed from birth to at least age five between 2001 and 2012. They also had data on the children's older siblings.

Overall, about 2 percent of the children had an older sibling with ASD. Those children were more likely to go on to develop ASD themselves whether they were vaccinated or not, according to the report.

The vaccine didn't increase their risk, the researchers say.

For example, among high-risk five year olds, ASD developed in 23 of 269 who weren't vaccinated (8.6 percent), compared to 30 of 796 (3.8 percent) who received two doses of the MMR vaccine.

Among kids not at high risk of ASD, 7,735 were unvaccinated at age five and 56 (0.7 percent) were diagnosed with the condition. That compared to 244 of 45,568 children (0.5 percent) who received two MMR doses.

Furthermore, children with an older sibling with ASD were significantly less likely to have received the MMR vaccine in the first place.

By age five, about 92 percent of the children without ASD in the family had received at least one MMR dose. By comparison, only 86 percent of children with an older sibling with ASD had been vaccinated by that age.

""I think it’s important to show that the degree of undervaccination in the families with children with autism spectrum disorder was significant,"" Jain told Reuters Health.

Alongside the lack of association between the vaccine and ASD, the undervaccination rate deserves attention, she said.

Roughly a dozen studies have shown that age of ASD onset and its severity do not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, wrote Dr. Bryan King, program director of the Autism Center at Seattle Children's Hospital, in an editorial accompanying the new study.

The new study, King added, now shows that ""the risk of ASD recurrence in families does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children.""",mainstream,M09b4b,vaccine.autism
1022,"Last week, Jerome Adams, the Surgeon General of the United States, announced that the federal coronavirus taskforce has turned its back on the “predictive contagion” computer models pushed by international health “experts” — who advised the U.S. government to shut down nonessential services and force unemployed citizens to huddle at home in fear rather than suffer monumental losses from possible exposure to the virus.

During a live interview on Sirius XM radio, the nation’s top doctor said that data from the World Health Organization (WHO), U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Bill Gates (“King Vaccine”) would be shelved in favor of real data:

“What the American people need to know now is we actually have data and so we’re tracking that data.”

Alarmingly high WHO estimates of the number of people in this country considered at risk from getting and dying from the Wuhan coronavirus have proven to be grossly inaccurate. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have not succumbed to the novel strain of infection, as these self-styled experts insisted.

It has been confirmed that various coronavirus reporting agencies have artificially inflated the real number of diagnosed cases and deaths directly due to a COVID-19 infection. The reason behind this charade is to generate fear, make the masses compliant with New World Order directives, and topple the U.S. economy.

A growing number of independent international health experts are contradicting the alarmism being spread around the world in the face of a bad case of the flu. Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi, a microbiology specialist, professor at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany, and head of the Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, said:

“We are afraid that 1 million infections with the new virus will lead to 30 deaths per day over the next 100 days. But we do not realize that 20, 30, 40 or 100 patients positive for normal coronaviruses are already dying every day.” [emphasis added]

Dr. Bhakdi called the government’s COVID-19 response measures “grotesque, absurd and very dangerous,” and added that they are shortening the life expectancy of millions of people. The panic is a fraud, according to the much-cited research scientist:

“The horrifying impact on the world economy threatens the existence of countless people. The consequences on medical care are profound. Already services to patients in need are reduced, operations canceled, practices empty, hospital personnel dwindling. All this will impact profoundly on our whole society.

“All these measures are leading to self-destruction and collective suicide based on nothing but a spook.”

Dr. Joel Kettner, a professor of Community Health Sciences and Surgery at Manitoba University in Canada, former Chief Public Health Officer for Manitoba province, and Medical Director of the International Centre for Infectious Diseases, said:

“I have never seen anything like this, anything anywhere near like this. I’m not talking about the pandemic, because I’ve seen 30 of them, one every year. It is called influenza. And other respiratory illness viruses, we don’t always know what they are. But I’ve never seen this reaction, and I’m trying to understand why.”

Many observers agree with Dr. Kettner’s assessment of the message being broadcast by the globalist health nazis:

“I worry about the message to the public, about the fear of coming into contact with people, being in the same space as people, shaking their hands, having meetings with people. I worry about many, many consequences related to that.”

Adams told Alex Marlow, host of Breitbart News Daily, that the real numbers show that businesses are safe to re-open in May and June. The NWO health nazis want U.S. business owners to fail by keeping them idle for six months or more. They are trying to push a national vaccine ID card that would determine whether or not citizens can travel or renew their driver’s licenses.

The Surgeon General said that, based on actual test data rather than doomsday prophesies based on theoretical computer simulations, U.S. businesses “in some places” can expect to resume operations in May or June. Locations hardest hit by the contagion, however, will continue living with the current medical lockdown:

“Other places won’t; it will be piece by piece, bit by bit, but will be data-driven,” advised Adams.

Frustrated citizens around the U.S. are gathering at their statehouses to voice their opposition to the prolonged enforced idleness and ridiculously unfair new rules on what is nonessential, including tools and seeds, from petty bureaucrats enjoying expanded powers under the national emergency.",conspiracy,C00f7e,bill.gates; vaccine.covid
737,"The U.S. government alone spends $200 million a year on a hunt for a vaccine against AIDS. At the forefront of that search stands Dr. David Baltimore, chairman of the National Institute of Health's AIDS Vaccine Research Committee. Currently president of the California Institute of Technology as well, Baltimore won the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Betsey Arledge, producer of the NOVA film ""Surviving AIDS,"" interviewed a cautiously optimistic Baltimore on the current state of the search for a vaccine.



 

 NOVA: Can you give me a sense of the magnitude of the AIDS epidemic at this time?



 Baltimore: The AIDS epidemic in this country is a serious issue, but it's not a major public health disaster the way it is abroad. In the world today there are something like 34 million infected people, and more people are being infected every minute. On the scale of any public health issue in the world, this is one of the major ones. There are more people dying of AIDS than of almost any other infectious disease, with tuberculosis and malaria being in the same ballpark. It's a horrendous situation. (See AIDS in Perspective.)



 NOVA: Do you think we're getting a little complacent in this country?



 



 Baltimore: I'm impressed that AIDS remains a very noted disease in the United States. It's noted in the newspapers all the time—what's going on in the world and in the country. There is very complete coverage of how good the drugs are and where the vaccine program stands. I don't think we've allowed it to fall off the radar screen. And we do far more AIDS research than the whole rest of the world; in the vaccine area alone, we do probably 90 percent of the research.



 NOVA: Can you give me a sense of the amount of effort—not just money, but intellectual effort—that has gone into trying to find a vaccine over the past 10 or 15 years?



 



 Baltimore: When H.I.V. was first discovered, the first thing that the then-Secretary of what became the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said was, ""We will have a vaccine in short order."" She was wrong about that, but it shows that from the very first moment a vaccine was on people's minds. Indeed, there has been a significant effort to make a vaccine from the very first day. I think people thought it would be simple, because we'd made vaccines for so many different viruses.



 The polio vaccine is effective because, for the most part, our bodies naturally fight this virus. This is not the case with HIV. The thing that worried me at the time—and it has turned out to be the biggest worry—was that if it were possible to make a vaccine, why doesn't the body ordinarily fight off the virus? Most viruses we fight off very well, including polio and even smallpox. A certain fraction of people may be maimed or killed by those viruses, but the much larger fraction of people get over them. That's not true for H.I.V. We knew that from very early on.



 



 At first we thought it might be that many people would be killed by it, and then we began to realize that almost everybody who had the infection was potentially going to be killed by it. That's fundamentally different than other viruses. And that fundamental difference was a red flag. The initial impetus that we'd be able to do it, it's around the corner, was just all wrong.



 NOVA: So the search for a vaccine has been a real struggle?



 Baltimore: It's been an enormous struggle, because the obvious things didn't work, and people got very frustrated by that. The next question became: Where do you turn? What's not obvious? What can we do? That involved bringing a whole different level of people into the discussion. Not the ordinary people who make vaccines, but people whose scientific focus is in other areas of immunology, of infectious disease—basic scientists. So it's been a ramping up process to get more and more people involved and thinking about it.



 Perhaps the most important role of the committee I'm now heading is to galvanize the scientific community to find new routes in thinking about a vaccine, so that maybe we can find a vaccine through some very non-traditional approach.



 NOVA: An international team of scientists announced recently that they had traced the origin of the AIDS virus to a subspecies of chimpanzee in Africa. If this report is verified, how will it help in the search for a vaccine?



 Baltimore: In truth, it will not have much effect on the search for a vaccine. However, it tells us a lot about why HIV is so hard to counter. It is not a virus that is native to the human species, and therefore it is continually mutating in an effort to adapt. Most human viruses are well-controlled by the human immune system, because they have evolved with it, and the two opposing forces are in a steady-state. We cannot wait until we and HIV evolve to being comfortable with each other. We must devise a vaccine, effectively short-circuiting the usual process of adaptation.



 NOVA: Who are the so-called long-term non-progressors, and how do they fit into the search?



 Bob Massie is a long-term non-progressor. His immune system's ability to fight HIV is inspiring a new approach to fighting AIDS. Baltimore: There is a small group of H.I.V.-infected people—maybe five percent—who don't get any symptoms and whose virus is maintained at a very low level. If we could find out the secret behind that, maybe we could replicate it in a vaccine. So far we haven't found the secret, but there are good correlations. These people have a good cytotoxic T lymphocyte response, they have a good helper T cell response. [Cytotoxic T lymphocytes, otherwise known as CTLs or CD8 killer T-cells, are cells involved in immune defense that can kill other cells infected by viruses. So-called CD4 helper T cells are essential for triggering antibody production, activating CTLs, and initiating other immune responses.] So that says if we can make those a focus of activity, maybe we can design a vaccine around those principles. But there's no certainty that those are the key issues.



 



 There is a balance of three things: whether the virus that those people have is different than the virus other people have; whether their immune system is somehow responding to it differently than other people's immune systems are; and whether their genetics are different. Are they inherently able to fight the virus? Or is it something that's learned and that therefore we could teach other people to do?

532,"This week, the first patients in a clinical trial for a potential COVID-19 vaccine were given shots, marking a key step in the global race to find a cure. Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute in Seattle developed a COVID-19 vaccine in record time and started administering the shots on Monday.

The first person to receive a dose of the potential vaccine was 43-year-old Jennifer Haller, an operations manager at a small tech company, according to The Associated Press. ""We all feel so helpless. This is an amazing opportunity for me to do something,"" Haller said, adding that her two teenagers ""think it's cool"" that she's taking part in the study.

Ultimately, 45 volunteers, ages 18 to 55, will get two doses the vaccine over a span of about 6 weeks, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the NIH, is funding the trial. The vaccine is called mRNA-1273 and was developed by NIAID, and Moderna, Inc., a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company.

""Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,"" NIAID Director Anthony Fauci said. ""This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.""

Other potential COVID-19 vaccines are being developed around the world, including at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. On Monday's ""CBS Evening News,"" David Martin spoke to doctors there to learn more about the potential cures.

Dr. Kayvon Modjarrad, a director at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, is testing a potential vaccine that would block the virus from attaching to a person's lung. ""If it can't get into your lung cells, it can't cause the disease,"" Modjarrad said.

Still, the race for the coronavirus vaccine could take 12 to 18 months to run, Martin reports. So, Lieutenant Colonel Mara Kreishman-Deitrick is working on a drug that people who already have the disease can take.

""What we're aiming to develop here is an antiviral treatment that will kill the virus and actually cure them of the disease so they don't further spread it to the rest of the community,"" she told Martin.

Kreishman-Deitrick says an existing drug used against Ebola may work against the novel coronavirus as well. ""It's ready for a clinical trial in humans and once those clinical trials show that it's affected then it will be available for wider use in humans,"" she said. It hasn't yet been proved effective but could be used as an emergency treatment.

COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has killed at more than 90 people in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. Globally, the death toll is over 7,500, with the most aggressive outbreaks still spreading in Europe and Iran.

Dr. Caitlin Rivers, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said Tuesday in a live webcast about the coronavirus pandemic that ""in some respects we are just getting started in the United States.""",mainstream,M0b986,vaccine
723,"A new trial has begun in Victoria this week to evaluate a potential vaccine against COVID-19.

The vaccine is called NVX-CoV2373 and is from a US biotech company, Novavax.

The trial will be carried out across Melbourne and Brisbane, and is the first human trial of a vaccine specifically for COVID-19 to take place in Australia.

This vaccine is actually based on a vaccine that was already in development for influenza. But how might it work against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19?

Read more: Could BCG, a 100-year-old vaccine for tuberculosis, protect against coronavirus?

Vaccines trigger an immune response by introducing the cells of our immune system to a virus in a safe way, without any exposure to the pathogen itself.

All vaccines have to do two things. The first is make our immune cells bind to and “eat up” the vaccine. The second is to activate these immune cells so they’re prepared to fight the current and any subsequent threats from the virus in question.

We often add molecules called adjuvants to vaccines to deliver a danger signal to the immune system, activate immune cells and trigger a strong immune response.

Read more: Revealed: the protein 'spike' that lets the 2019-nCoV coronavirus pierce and invade human cells

The Novavax vaccine is what we call a “subunit” vaccine because, instead of delivering the whole virus, it delivers only part of it. The element of SARS-CoV-2 in this vaccine is the spike protein, which is found on the surface of the virus.

By targeting a particular protein, a subunit vaccine is a great way to focus the immune response.

However, protein by itself is not very good at binding to and activating the cells of our immune system. Proteins are generally soluble, which doesn’t appeal to immune cells. They like something they can chew on.

So instead of soluble protein, Novavax has assembled the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into very small particles, called nanoparticles. To immune cells, these nanoparticles look like little viruses, so immune cells can bind to these pre-packaged chunks of protein, rapidly engulfing them and becoming activated.

The Novavax vaccine also contains an adjuvant called Matrix-M. While the nanoparticles deliver a modest danger signal, Matrix-M can be added to deliver a much stronger danger signal and really wake up the immune system.

The Novavax vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is based on a vaccine the company was already developing for influenza, called NanoFlu.

The NanoFlu vaccine contains similar parts – nanoparticles with the Matrix-M adjuvant. But it uses a different protein in the nanoparticle (hemagglutinin, which is on the outside of the influenza virus).

In October last year, Novavax started testing NanoFlu in a phase III clinical trial, the last level of clinical testing before a vaccine can be licensed. This trial had 2,650 volunteers and researchers were comparing whether NanoFlu performed as well as Fluzone, a standard influenza vaccine.

Read more: Where are we at with developing a vaccine for coronavirus?

An important feature of this trial is participants were over the age of 65. Older people tend to have poorer responses to vaccines, because immune cells become more difficult to activate as we age.

This trial is ongoing, with volunteers to be followed until the end of the year. However, early results suggest NanoFlu can generate significantly higher levels of antibodies than Fluzone – even given the older people in the trial.

Antibodies are small proteins made by our immune cells which bind strongly to viruses and can stop them from infecting cells in the nose and lungs. So increased antibodies with NanoFlu should result in lower rates of infection with influenza.

These results were similar to those released after the phase I trial of NanoFlu, and suggest NanoFlu would be the superior vaccine for influenza.

So the big question is – will the same strategy work for SARS-CoV-2?

The new phase I/II trial will enrol around 131 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 59 to assess the vaccine’s safety and measure how it affects the body’s immune response.

Some volunteers will not receive the vaccine, as a placebo control. The rest will receive the vaccine, in a few different forms.

The trial will test two doses of protein nanoparticles – a low (5 microgram) or a high (25 microgram) dose. Both doses will be delivered with Matrix-M adjuvant but the higher dose will also be tested without Matrix-M.

All groups will receive two shots of the vaccine 21 days apart, except one group that will just get one shot.

This design enables researchers to ask four important questions:
• None can the vaccine induce an immune response?
• None if so, what dose of nanoparticle is best?
• None do you need adjuvant or are nanoparticles enough?
• None do you need two shots or is one enough?

Read more: Coronavirus anti-vaxxers aren’t a huge threat yet. How do we keep it that way?

While it’s not yet clear how the vaccine will perform for SARS-CoV-2, Novavax has reported it generated strong immune responses in animals.

And we know NanoFlu performed well and had a good safety profile for influenza. NanoFlu also seemed to work well in older adults, which would be essential for a vaccine for COVID-19.

We eagerly await the first set of results, expected in a couple of months – an impressive turnaround time for a clinical trial. If this initial study is successful, the phase II portion of the trial will begin, with more participants.

63,"James Jeffrey ""Jeff"" Bradstreet (July 6, 1954 – June 19, 2015), was an American doctor, alternative medicine practitioner, and a former preacher[2] who ran the International Child Development Resource Center in Melbourne, Florida,[3] a medical practice in Buford, Georgia[4] and in Arizona, where he practiced homeopathy.[5][6] He also founded the Good News Doctor Foundation, which aimed to combine Christian beliefs with his medical practice.[7]

Bradstreet obtained a Florida medical license in 1984. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of South Florida in 1976, where he also went to medical school beginning three years later. His postgraduate research focused on aerospace medicine, and he received his training in this field from Wilford Hall Medical Center. He was an adjunct professor of child development and neuroscience at the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine in Tempe, Arizona.[8]

Bradstreet published autism research, which he claimed indicated vaccines as a cause, in the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, which is not indexed by PubMed. This research claimed that autistic children had a higher body burden of mercury,[9] and that three autistic children had measles RNA in their cerebrospinal fluid.[10] The Institute of Medicine has rejected any relationship between vaccines and autism.[11]

Bradstreet treated an autistic child named Colten Snyder (one of the test cases in the autism omnibus trial) with chelation therapy on the premise of removing mercury from his body, in spite of the fact that hair, blood, and urine tests had failed to show he exhibited abnormal levels of mercury.[12] Over an eight-year period, Colten visited Bradstreet's office 160 times.[13] Stephen Barrett has stated, ""It appears to me that Bradstreet decides which of his nonstandard theories to apply and records diagnoses that embody them,"" and describes Bradstreet's mercury provoked tests as ""phony"".[12] Peter Hotez characterized Bradstreet's proposal to treat autism with chelation therapy as ""dangerous.""[6]

In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Bradstreet defended the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as an autism treatment, saying, ""Every kid with autism should have a trial of IVIG if money was not an option and IVIG was abundant.""[14] Bradstreet also published research regarding the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for autism,[15] some of which concluded it was ineffective,[16] as well as a paper arguing that autistic children have an increased vulnerability to oxidative stress.[17] Further treatments Bradstreet used on autistic children included the controversial protein GcMAF, with which he claimed to have treated 600 children.[18] In an article for an anti-vaccine magazine, Bradstreet endorsed stem cell therapy as an autism treatment.[19]

Bradstreet was found dead from a gunshot wound to the chest in the Broad River in Rutherford County, North Carolina in June 2015, after his Buford, Georgia medical office was raided by the FDA in connection with an investigation into GcMAF treatments.[4][20][21] At the time of his death, he lived in Braselton and ran his medical practice in Buford.[4] While the police ruled Bradstreet's death a suicide, several family members and anti-vaccine activists claimed he was murdered in connection with his criticism of vaccines.[22]

Bradstreet's son is autistic, which Bradstreet attributed to a vaccination his son received at age 15 months.[23]

331,"Measles cases have spread across the US this year, with the state of New York now facing its worst outbreak in decades.

Since last autumn, more than 150 cases have been recorded in Rockland County, a New York suburb home to a large ultra-Orthodox Jewish community where there has been some resistance to vaccinations.

The vast majority of US states allow families to opt out of getting vaccinated if they object on religious grounds and parents seem to take advantage of these rules.

Researchers have found that broad philosophical and religious exemptions to vaccine requirements are associated with higher rates of unvaccinated children.

But this year’s outbreaks are now raising public health questions about why states allow such exemptions. Here is how religious exemptions work:

What is a religious exemption to a vaccine, and which US states have them?

Religious exemptions allow parents to opt their children out of mandated vaccination policies if they object to the vaccine for religious reasons and if they follow the state’s opt-out process.

Almost every state, plus Washington DC, allows for a religious exemption beginning at least in kindergarten.

Four states do not: California, West Virginia, Mississippi and Arizona.

Each state has its own rules regarding vaccinations for children who attend public schools. In addition to the religious exemption, all 50 states, plus Washington DC, allow exceptions for medical reasons.

Examples include a child who has a condition like cancer or an immune disorder where a vaccine could be harmful to the child’s health.

And more than a dozen states offer philosophical exemptions, sometimes known as personal-belief exemptions, which do not require that a parent’s desire to opt out be specifically about their religious beliefs. Instead, they can include exemptions for conscience or moral ideology.

California, West Virginia and Mississippi, which do not allow religious exemptions, also do not allow philosophical objections.

How are religious exemptions connected to the recent US measles outbreak?

The measles outbreak in the New York suburb of Rockland County has largely been cantered in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, where there has been some recent resistance to vaccinations.

Vaccination rates tend to be low among the ultra-Orthodox, and the reasons vary, from fear of interference from outsiders to confusion over accurate religious and medical information.

The current flare-up in New York and New Jersey, both of which allow religious exemptions, can be traced back to the measles outbreaks in Israel last year.

Because ultra-Orthodox parents often send their children to their own religious schools, the outbreak was initially largely contained. But it has recently spread significantly.

Some Orthodox Jewish schools have been allowing unvaccinated children to attend school, against the New York Health Department’s mandate, during the measles outbreak.

How are vaccines a religious issue for some people?

Some people worry that vaccinating interrupts a divine plan for someone’s life, and they do not want to interfere in God’s will.

Others have concerns that some vaccines could violate religious dietary laws, unless they are designated kosher or halal.

Last year an influential Islamic group in Indonesia issued a controversial fatwa, which was later overturned, against the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine, citing its use of porcine gelatin.

And many of those who oppose abortion object to certain vaccines, like those designed to prevent chickenpox or hepatitis A.

Those vaccines are made by growing viruses in fetal embryo fibroblast cells, or cell lines that are grown in laboratories but are derived from two elective abortions in the 1960s.

A Catholic family in Kentucky, for example, has filed a lawsuit against the Northern Kentucky Health Department for banning unvaccinated students from school and athletics during a chickenpox outbreak at their son’s Catholic school.

Are the recent measles outbreaks causing some US states to reconsider exemptions?

To an extent, yes. Vaccine exemptions for children enrolled in kindergarten have slowly grown over the past decade, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), prompting some states to consider changes.

California got rid of its non-medical exemptions in 2015. A few states that allow religious exemptions have made them more difficult to get, requiring things like a signed affidavit from a religious leader instead of simply filling out an online form.

State lawmakers, often Republicans, around the country introduced more than 150 bills from 2011 through 2017 that would have made it easier to obtain exemptions from vaccine policies.

But according to a study in the American Journal of Public Health published in January, the 13 bills signed into law actually limited the ability to exempt.

Some professional organisations have also taken action. The American Association of Pediatrics has made the elimination of non-medical vaccination exemptions its top priority this year, even ranking it above family separations at the border.

Are religious leaders doing anything to address the issue?

Yes. Rabbis and doctors organised a public health campaign to stress the importance of vaccines. The Orthodox Union and the Rabbinal Council of America have strongly urged parents to vaccinate their children.

“It is well known that those facing even a potential life-or-death situation are instructed to set aside the Sabbath and other key tenets of halachic (Jewish law) observance until the emergency has passed,” they said in November.

Elsewhere, local health and community leaders have stressed open communication between health officials and religious leaders to bridge cultural divides.

In Colorado, Dr Joshua Williams, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, has recommended that the groups talk at specific times, such as when the academic year begins or at the start of influenza season, and not just during a health crisis.

He is also working with the state’s Council of Churches to hold sessions with parishioners to hear their concerns.

“Religious vaccinations exemptions impact public health,” Dr Williams said. “There is a need to dialogue with religious leaders around vaccine exemptions at local and national levels.”",mainstream,M09bbb,vaccine.autism
1041,"Prof Openshaw, an expert in experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said: ""We're actually considering a paper at Nervtag this week which is about targeting of different sub-populations with vaccines.

""I would say that sometimes it's possible to protect a vulnerable group by targeting another group. This, for example, is being done with influenza.""

Although they stand to benefit most because of their vulnerability, older people often derive the least benefit from vaccines because the drugs tend to prompt a weaker immune response.

Prof Openshaw said healthcare workers and people in other public-facing jobs could also be considered for vaccination first.

Also giving evidence, Professor Arne Akbar, the president of the British Society of Immunology, said: ""Vaccines don't work very well in older people. This has been shown with many other vaccines in the past.

""So we might have to have something as well as a vaccine to get optimum protection for older people.""

He suggested that, alongside a vaccine, older people could be offered an anti-inflammatory drug such as dexamethasone, which has recently shown strong results in those who are severely ill with coronavirus.

""Just a vaccine alone will help the younger people, and that will be good because then, if the younger people are not infected, they will not spread it to the older people – but it won't directly help the older group very much,"" Prof Akbar said.

His comments came as a new study of the potential Oxford vaccine in pigs found that two doses induced a better response than one.

The G7 backed Mrs May’s call for more pressure to be put on internet companies such as Google, Facebook and Twitter to target extremist messages online. This will include developing technology which automatically identifies and removes messages that incite violence….. The G7 will support the creation of an international industry-led forum to develop and share tools of this type, she said.

Of course by extremism they are referring to ISIS and the radicalisation of young muslim men, well at least that is what we are led to believe is their purpose for such measures. But in reality this is not just about ISIS, in fact it has nothing whatsoever to do with ISIS. Last week we reported how Theresa May proposed to ‘Govern the Internet’ in order to control explicit material:

The state reported 46,735 coronavirus cases over the past 14 days, representing 36% of California's total cases. ""The positivity rate had been stable, but now it's going slightly up,"" Newsom said at a press briefing. Although more people are being tested in California, that doesn't provide the full explanation behind the rising case numbers, according to Newsom. He said the state is prepared to absorb further increases in positive cases in terms of providing hospital beds and care, and that he has mitigation strategies if the pandemic worsens in California.

Contact tracing 'will save lives' if the U.S. builds it

4:30 p.m. ET — Contact tracing, in which trained health officials contact infected people to investigate the source of an outbreak and alert potentially exposed people, is one of the few proven tactics the U.S. has to combat the coronavirus.



In lieu of federal leadership, the effort has been largely relegated to often underfunded health departments that are struggling to meet the unprecedented demand placed on them by the coronavirus pandemic. ″[Contact tracing] is a standard tool and it really works, but when it's not in place, or in the case of when you start trying to implement it after the virus is quite literally already spreading in your community, it's almost impossible to catch up,"" said Dr. Karen Smith, former director of the California Department of Public Health.

Google's U.S. ad revenue will drop for the first time ever, as the pandemic delivers blow to businesses

12:55 p.m. ET — Google's U.S. advertising revenue will see its first-ever decline this year, according to research firm eMarketer, which began modeling the business in 2008. The new report shows the extent to which even Google's robust digital ad business has likely suffered during the coronavirus pandemic, which has taken an especially hard toll on some of the platform's biggest advertisers in the travel industry. While advertising on YouTube is expected to grow, it won't make up for Google's expected 7.2% drop in net U.S. search ad revenue this year, according to eMarketer. The model also signals that Google's digital advertising rivals may be able to close in on the company's No. 1 spot in share of digital ad spend in the U.S. Both Facebook and Amazon are expected to continue growing their U.S. advertising revenue this year, though at slower rates than in previous years. Facebook and Amazon's ad businesses have less exposure to the travel industry than Google, which could help them weather the crisis. —Lauren Feiner

Northeast unlikely to see spike despite reopening, Dr. Scott Gottlieb says

10:34 a.m. ET — With New York City moving its next phase of reopening, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb says the city and region are unlikely to see a major spike in new cases. Some states mostly in the South and West that reopened early — before they had driven spread down to a contained level and before they had the necessary testing and tracing infrastructure in place — have seen major resurgences in infection over the past couple of weeks. ""We'll see an increase in cases, but we're reopening against a much different backdrop,"" Gottlieb said on ""Squawk Box."" ""So I wouldn't expect to see the big increases that they're seeing in the Southeast and the South here when we reopen."" Gottlieb said that because so many people were initially infected in New York City and the tri-state region, a large portion of the population likely has some level of immunity against the virus already. That will help limit spread, Gottlieb added. —William Feuer Disclosure: Scott Gottlieb is a CNBC contributor and is a member of the boards of Pfizer, genetic-testing start-up Tempus and biotech company Illumina.

367,"Legendary gold and market expert Jim Sinclair says the virus that originated in China may have, oddly enough, done some good. Sinclair explains, “The effect of the coronavirus was literally to shut down business globally, therefore, shut off the demand for loans, which also shut off demand for short term money. So, what the public has not seen, is not considering and does not understand is we were stepping into the door of a major financial crisis magnitudes larger than what happened in 2008 and 2009. It’s a horrible thing that this virus occurred, but if it had not occurred, we would have been in a crisis much more serious than 2008 and 2009. . . . It was blowing sky high . . . . Shutting down demand is all we could do. It stopped the explosion of interest rates.”

Where do we go from here? Sinclair says, “We are going to make a recovery. It’s not going to be a ‘V’ by any means. The stock market could be a ‘V’ because the stock market has very little to do with reality. . . . As far as business is concerned, very serious damage has been done to the infrastructure to the business equation. Many employers are gone. Many corporations have significant readjustments to be able to build up again. The supply lines and logistics, where did everything come from? China. . . . This is a major worldwide adjustment, both economically and politically. . . . We had everything made in the cheapest place possible. . . . This is not a passing phenomenon. . . . The only thing that has been steady is gold. . . . The change that this brings about is a reconstruction of the basic business foundations. It’s a start over, it’s not just a slowdown. How many restaurants make money on 50% of the clients? You can’t. How many automobiles have built up on the lots? Enormous amounts. How many clothing stores shut down full of winter clothes and can’t make the shift to summer wear? You can go down the entire line. So, this recovery will be more like an ‘L’. We’ve come straight down, and we are going to go sideways now. . . . Many businesses are not going to open up again. . . .The idea of the coming inflation as a result of this is simple. Everything that you need will go up in price. Everything you don’t need is not going to hold value. You are better off with a freezer full of fine cuts of beef than you are with a brand new Tesla. The beef will go up in price, the Tesla will go down.”

On gold, Sinclair says the ultimate price is an easy-to-calculate math problem. How much gold does America have compared to how much debt it has? So, how high could gold ultimately go? Sinclair says, “It’s simple math. You take the amount of gold the U.S. says it has, and then you take the debt it has, and what price would you need for the debt to balance to zero? The price on the low end is $50,000 per ounce. The true price is $87,500 per ounce.”

Is a biblical debt jubilee coming to America? Sinclair says, “We already have jubilees. If you don’t pay your rent, you have a jubilee. If you don’t pay your student loan, you have a jubilee. If the payment of your auto insurance is postponed, you have a jubilee. We’ve got jubilee after jubilee after jubilee. Keep in mind, one man’s jubilee is another man’s disaster. It’s almost as if the Bible is correct in terms of economics. Also, keep in mind, the people who aren’t being paid are being hurt very badly.”

Sinclair thinks the recovery will take a decade or longer, and Sinclair says, “It will be just like the period between 1929 up to WWII (1941).”

774,"The measles outbreaks continue to spread, with New York City declaring a public health emergency and requiring people in four ZIP codes to have their children vaccinated or face penalties, including a fine of US$1,000 and or imprisonment.

Since September 2018, 285 measles cases have been reported in Brooklyn and Queens, mainly in neighborhoods where ultra-Orthodox Jews have chosen to not have their children vaccinated.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that from Jan. 1 to April 4, 2019, 465 individual cases of measles have been confirmed in 19 states. This is the second-highest number of cases since the CDC declared measles eliminated in 2000; in 2014, 667 cases occurred.

Cases have still been occurring each year, often brought into the United States from international travelers. Officials believe that to be the cause of the outbreak in Rockland County, New York, where 168 cases were reported as of April 8, 2019.

Rockland public health officials issued a ban that would keep unvaccinated children out of public places, but a judge overruled that on April 5. On April 9, county officials said they would appeal.

But there are limits to what health care providers, public health officials and legislators can do. It is crucial to consider both the power – and the limits – of potential solutions that will provide education, medical care and protection for the public while still upholding principles of informed consent, parental decision-making and sustaining public trust.

As a professor who researches and teaches health law, public health law and medical ethics, I think it’s worth clarifying what states can or cannot legally do when responding to cases of communicable disease.

The law recognizes the right of an individual to refuse medical interventions. Health law has a strong history of recognizing bodily integrity: Adults can choose whether to accept or reject a proposed medical intervention, even in instances where public health authorities conclude a vaccine would benefit both the individual and society. The Supreme Court has recognized parents’ ability to direct the care and control of their children, including consenting or forgoing medical treatment for their child except in very specific circumstances.

In the 1905 Jacobson v. Massachusetts case, the Supreme Court upheld a state law delegating power to local health officials mandating that adults receive one smallpox vaccine in the midst of an epidemic or pay a fine (about $130 today). Under the concept of police power, states have a duty to enact laws that promote the health, safety and welfare of its residents. Public health authorities may offer vaccines as a method of prevention, but medical professionals, public health authorities and even courts may not legally compel a person to submit to a vaccine.

The Jacobson decision also set forth limits on police power, yet subsequent cases addressing vaccine mandates discarded these requirements, extending multiple vaccine mandates to school attendance for disease not in circulation and in the absence of an epidemic.

Deferring to respected scientific consensus as a means to justify forced medical interventions in the name of individual benefit and the public good has historically resulted in some of the most egregious constitutional and human rights atrocities in the U.S. The mass forcible sterilization during the eugenics movement is but one example.

The history of science and medicine further demonstrates the fallibility of commonly accepted medical knowledge, such as when Bayer introduced heroin as a safe, non-addictive substitute for morphine, or physicians prescribed Bendectin and thalidomide to relieve nausea, only to find these medications resulted in babies born with severe birth defects.

The law is also quite clear that public health authorities and law enforcement may place restrictions on a person’s individual liberty – including religious liberty – in situations where a person’s actions pose a direct, immediate and compelling harm to others, such as using venomous snakes in religious worship or asserting a nonexistent “right” to use an illegal substance such as marijuana when operating a motor vehicle.

In public health law relating to communicable disease, this constitutes a very specific standard: A person must have a present disease, and this person’s actions must pose a direct threat to others.

For example, health officials may seek a quarantine order or civil commitment for a person with active tuberculosis who continues to frequent highly populated public spaces until the person is no longer contagious.

Even in such a case, health authorities can offer treatment and limit a person’s movement to prevent infecting others, but the law does not permit forcibly medicating a competent person against his will.

Accordingly, legal precedent does not support quarantining vast geographic areas of healthy persons who have not been exposed to the communicable illness, but would support tailored voluntary isolation and quarantine of persons who have been exposed to, or currently have, the illness.

What health officials can do to protect children

The CDC classifies vaccines as one of the top 10 public health achievements. The vast majority (about 98%) of parents across the U.S. as a whole comply with the state law mandated schedule of vaccines for their children.

Vaccines, like any other FDA-approved product such as a prescription drug or medical device, carry a set of risks and benefits. These calculations vary depending on the vaccine, its efficacy, safety, potential side effects, the severity of the illness the vaccine aims to protect against, and the individual to whom it is administered.

Vaccine science and practice similarly evolved with historical mistakes (the Cutter incident) and ongoing disputes about risks and benefits for individual vaccines like flu and anthrax.

To promote vaccination for children, health officials may offer educational campaigns and set up free clinics for parents to bring their children. State laws may also mandate vaccines as a condition for school attendance, or require excluding unvaccinated children during an active outbreak at their school.

However, if states offer a religious or nonmedical exemption, courts have been clear that health officials and school officials do not have discretion to require the child’s parent to identify with an organized religion or reject the sincerity of the parent’s beliefs because this violates the First Amendment.

Public health professionals worry that parents who forgo vaccination are placing their child and the community at risk. Some have advocated that the state should step in with coercive measures such as eliminating any nonmedical exemptions for all children or intervene by force, such as classifying parents’ decision as child neglect or seeking a court order to vaccinate the child.

In my opinion, these strategies rely on a distortion of legal precedent, dismiss longstanding authority of parents to make decisions for their children, and threaten to undermine an already fractured public trust.

Cases that uphold state intervention to protect a child by compelling medical treatment generally require that the child has an illness, the illness is severe and life-threatening, and the risks and benefits of intervening are assessed.

This requires medical professionals and health officials to maintain precision in distinguishing whether the parents are deciding to forgo recommended vaccines, or whether they are refusing medical care for a critically ill child. Indeed, a recent case in Chandler, Arizona, demonstrated how a climate of coercion and force may result in parental fear and refusal to constructively engage with state officials for even an ill child.

State public health officials have the duty to protect residents from illness and communicable disease, but these strategies must fall within appropriate legal parameters. Dismissing these legal boundaries or justifying unnecessary force not only undermines fundamental liberties, but in my view fuels parental and community distrust of health officials and sets back the ultimate goals of protecting the public.",mainstream,M0aa09,vaccine
756,"Pathogens are microbes that cause diseases . Vaccines allow a dead or altered form of the disease causing pathogen to be introduced into the body, which contain a specific antigen . This causes the immune system, specifically the white blood cells , to produce complementary antibodies , which target and attach to the antigen. When a white blood cell engulfs and digests a pathogen it is called phagocytosis.

During the primary infection the antibodies slowly increase, peak at around ten days and then gradually decrease. A second exposure to the same pathogen causes the white blood cells to respond quickly in order to produce lots of the relevant antibodies, which prevents infection.",mainstream,M07fd6,vaccine
887,"A teenager who made headlines for getting vaccinated despite his family's wishes has testified about his experience to US lawmakers.

Ethan Lindenberger, from Ohio, sought immunisations aged 18 after turning to the internet for advice.

Federal data suggests the proportion of US children under two not being immunised has quadrupled since 2001.

Doctors at the hearing blamed online misinformation and discredited science for scaring parents away from vaccines.

Mr Lindenberger, who is still a senior in high school, spoke on Tuesday at the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions alongside four doctors who are experts in the field.

He said much of his mother's opposition to routine vaccines came from fear they could cause side-effects like brain damage or autism.

In 1998, a study by a British doctor Andrew Wakefield incorrectly linked the MMR (Measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine to autism. His research has since been completely discredited and Mr Wakefield has been struck off - but the theory has endured within the global anti-vaccination community.
• 'Don't be taken in by social media vaccine myths'

All four doctors at Tuesday's hearing echoed that there was ""absolutely no evidence"" that exists which supports the link.

This is also affirmed in new Danish research released on Tuesday. The study examined 650,000 children over 10 years and categorically concludes that MMR does not increase the risk of autism or trigger it in those susceptible.

Mr Lindenbenger, doctors and members of Congress at the hearing all pointed out the internet fuels the spread of misinformation.

""My mother would turn to anti-vax groups online and social media rather than health officials and critical sources,"" the teenager told the hearing.

He also pointed out his mother's decision had come from concern, not malice.

""There's a lot of emotional appeals talking about families, children and appealing to a parent's love, and manipulating that to convince them vaccines are dangerous,"" he told the hearing about the nature of online posts.

""That's the issue I take. I have tried to convey to my parents I don't think they are stupid for believing that, but people are very convincing and that's very dangerous.""

Mr Lindenberger's story went viral in late 2018 when he asked online forum Reddit about the subject.

At one point during Tuesday's hearing, Republican Senator Johnny Isakson joked that he would ""love"" to be a guest at the Linderberger family home for Thanksgiving dinner.

""Would be a heck of a discussion everybody would have,"" he said about the family's public disagreement.

Health experts have long warned about the risk posed by parents who do not vaccinate.

They say the decision affects not only their families but everyone else because high vaccination rates are integral to keep communities protected.

This concept, which is known as herd immunity, offers protection for people like newborns and people with auto-immune diseases who are not able to be vaccinated.

The US has been battling a number of outbreaks of preventable diseases in recent years.

Senator Patty Murray, from Washington state, spoke at the hearing about a recent measles outbreak in her local Clark County where 70 cases have been confirmed.

Less than 80% of nursery-age children were immunised there in 2017 - well below the target rate of about 95% for herd immunity.

At Tuesday's hearing, doctors implored the federal government to increase funding for vaccine education. They also asked state lawmakers to increase limits on non-medical vaccination exemptions for parents.

California is one state that has already cracked down on exemptions, following an outbreak of measles linked to Disneyland in 2015.

Similar outbreaks are not isolated to the US - there have been increases recorded elsewhere around the world.

In 2018, Europe saw three times more measles case than the year before.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) have blamed growing vaccine hesitancy for the outbreaks.

351,"The best ways to convince people of the benefits of vaccinations may be to show them pictures of a child with measles or to have them read a description of the disease written by a mom whose child was infected, according to a new study.

These ways are more effective than showing people information summarizing recent research that shows there is no link between vaccines and an increased risk of autism in children, the researchers found.

The researchers found that directing people's attention to the risks posed by not getting vaccinated by showing them the pictures of sick children and having them read a mom's written account of her child's disease changed their attitudes, leading them to think more positively about vaccinations, study author Zachary Horne, a graduate student at the University of Illinois, said in a statement.

That was true for even ""the most skeptical participants in the study,"" Horne said.

There were 644 cases of measles in the United States in 2014, according to the study. That's triple the number seen in 2013. And back in 2000, researchers thought that this disease had been eliminated from the U.S., according to the study. [5 Dangerous Vaccine Myths]

""The re-emergence of measles has been linked to an increase in the number of parents refusing to vaccinate their children,"" the researchers wrote in their study. One reason that parents don't vaccinate their children is the mistaken belief that the vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella (the MMR vaccine) is linked with an increased risk of autism. Researchers have been looking for effective ways to convince people who hold this mistaken belief about the benefits of vaccinations.

In the new study, the researchers asked 315 people questions to examine their views on several potentially controversial subjects, including their attitudes toward vaccines and their willingness to vaccinate their kids.

Then, the people in the study were assigned to one of three groups. People in the first group looked at science-based materials that challenged the anti-vaccination point of view. People in the second group read a paragraph written by a mother describing her child's infection with measles, and also looked at pictures of children with measles, mumps or rubella. They also read three warnings about why it is important to vaccinate kids. People in the third group, which was a comparison group, were asked to read about a subject not related to vaccines.

Then, the researchers again evaluated the people's views on vaccination and their intentions to vaccinate their children in the future. The investigators found that the intervention that involved showing people the consequences of the diseases was the one that had the biggest effect on the people who were initially the most skeptical about vaccinations, Horne said.

In contrast, showing people the scientific evidence that there is no link between vaccines and autism did not change the people's views on vaccination, the researchers said. The reason this type of intervention doesn't work is likely that trying to convince someone that his or her beliefs are false is not the best argumentative strategy, Horne said.

The study shows that ""instead of going up against the belief about the link between vaccines and autism,"" researchers should aim to convince people that, independent of whether they believe in that link, they should also believe that there are serious consequences of not getting children vaccinated, Horne told Live Science.

""The insight [from the study] was to direct their attention towards those consequences, rather than trying to combat their false beliefs that there is some link where there is not,"" Horne said.

The new study was published today (Aug. 3) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

 birthday and a second dose when they are aged three years and four months old.

Measles is a viral infection which is spread from person to person. Symptoms of measles include:

Symptoms can last up to 10 days in children and longer in adults. The infection can cause serious complications.

Mumps is caused by a virus. Symptoms for most people are:
• painful swollen glands in the face and neck

Symptoms last up to 10 days. The condition can also cause complications.

Rubella is a mild viral disease, also known as German measles.
• None swollen glands behind the ear and the back of the neck

Some adults also have painful joints. The infection is very serious in pregnancy.

It is important to protect children against measles, mumps and rubella as these diseases can have serious complications.

In some cases, measles can cause death. In children aged under two years, one child in 8,000 will develop a fatal degenerative brain condition within eight years of getting measles.
• deafness - usually with partial or complete recovery

Rubella can cause inflammation of the brain and can affect blood clotting. In pregnant women, it can cause miscarriage or major health problems for their babies such as:

MMR vaccine protects your child against measles, mumps and rubella. They get the vaccine in two doses:

Experts from around the world, including the World Health Organization (WHO), agree that there is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.

Separate vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella are not recommended. Single vaccines put children at risk while they wait between each vaccine. It also means that children need repeat injections and are more at risk of adverse reactions at the injection site.

1319,"In response to outbreaks of measles in France and Italy, resulting from a growing trend for parents to refuse vaccinations for their children, authorities have announced plans to make childhood immunisation compulsory. Last week, a newspaper editorial demanded similar measures in Britain, insisting that parental refusal of immunisation “should not be tolerated”.

Though I have been actively involved over the past decade in promoting the MMR vaccine in face of claims of a link with autism, I hope British immunisation authorities will continue to resists calls for compulsion.

As the father of a child with autism who was also as a GP administering vaccinations to babies, I read with great interest Andrew Wakefield’s now notorious 1998 study in the The Lancet suggesting a link between MMR and autism. It was immediately obvious that though this paper presented no evidence for this link, it would cause undue alarm among parents of children with autism as well as among parents of children due for vaccinations.

In response I wrote the first of a series of articles, culminating in 2004 in a book MMR and Autism: What Parents Need To Know. This book sought to reassure parents that they had no grounds to fear that MMR had caused their children’s autism, and that it offered effective protection against serious diseases. It was a great relief when Wakefield’s work was finally exposed as fraudulent and he departed Britain to join a wacky fringe of conspiracy theorists and alternative health cranks in the United States.",mainstream,M0bec3,vaccine.autism
1255,"The report that first triggered scares that a vaccine to prevent measles, mumps and rubella might cause autism in children has received another devastating blow to its credibility. The British Medical Journal has declared that the research was not simply bad science, as has been known for years, but a deliberate fraud.

The study, led by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, was published in The Lancet in 1998. It was based on just 12 children with supposedly autismlike disorders and purported to find a link between the vaccine, the gastrointestinal problems found in many autistic children, and autism.

While parents around the world were understandably alarmed, many scientists rejected the claims, including, eventually, 10 of Dr. Wakefield’s co-authors. A high-level British medical group, after an exhaustive fitness-to-practice hearing, found Dr. Wakefield guilty of dishonesty and misconduct. The Lancet retracted the article in part, it said, because the authors had made false claims about how the study was conducted.

Only about half of Americans say they would get a COVID-19 vaccine if the scientists working furiously to create one succeed, according to a poll conducted May 14-18 by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Only about half of Americans say they would get a COVID-19 vaccine if the scientists working furiously to create one succeed, according to a new poll from .

That’s surprisingly low considering the effort going into the against the coronavirus that has sparked a pandemic since first emerging from China late last year. But more people might eventually roll up their sleeves: The poll, released Wednesday, found 31% simply weren’t sure if they’d get vaccinated. Another 1 in 5 said they’d refuse.

Health experts already worry about the whiplash if vaccine promises like President Donald Trump’s goal of a 300 million-dose stockpile by January fail. Only time and science will tell -- and the new poll shows the public is indeed skeptical.

“It’s always better to under-promise and over-deliver,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

“The unexpected looms large and that’s why I think for any of these vaccines, we’re going to need a large safety database to provide the reassurance,” he added.

Among Americans who say they wouldn’t get vaccinated, 7 in 10 worry about safety.

“I am not an anti-vaxxer,” said Melanie Dries, 56, of Colorado Springs, Colorado. But, “to get a COVID-19 vaccine within a year or two ... causes me to fear that it won’t be widely tested as to side effects.”

Dr. Francis Collins, who directs the National Institutes of Health, insists safety is the top priority. The NIH is creating a master plan for testing the leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates in tens of thousands of people, to prove if they really work and also if they're safe.

“I would not want people to think that we’re cutting corners because that would be a big mistake. I think this is an effort to try to achieve efficiencies, but not to sacrifice rigor,” Collins told the AP earlier this month.

“Definitely the worst thing that could happen is if we rush through a vaccine that turns out to have significant side effects,” Collins added.

Among those who want a vaccine, the AP-NORC poll found protecting themselves, their family and the community are the top reasons.

""I’m definitely going to get it,” said Brandon Grimes, 35, of Austin, Texas. “As a father who takes care of his family, I think ... it’s important for me to get vaccinated as soon as it’s available to better protect my family.”

And about 7 in 10 of those who would get vaccinated say life won't go back to normal without a vaccine. A site foreman for his family’s construction business, Grimes travels from house to house interacting with different crews, and said some of his coworkers also are looking forward to vaccination to minimize on-the-job risk.

The new coronavirus is most dangerous to older adults and people of any age who have chronic health problems such as diabetes or heart disease. The poll found 67% of people 60 and older say they’d get vaccinated, compared with 40% who are younger.

And death counts suggest black and Hispanic Americans are more vulnerable to COVID-19, because of unequal access to health care and other factors. Yet the poll found just 25% of African Americans and 37% of Hispanics would get a vaccine compared to 56% of whites.

Among people who don't want a vaccine, about 4 in 10 say they're concerned about catching COVID-19 from the shot. But most of the leading vaccine candidates don't contain the coronavirus itself, meaning they can't cause infection.

And 3 in 10 who don't want a vaccine don't fear getting seriously ill from the coronavirus.

Over 5.5 million people worldwide have been confirmed infected by the virus, and more than 340,000 deaths have been recorded, including nearly 100,000 in the U.S., according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. Experts believe the true toll is significantly higher.

And while most people who get COVID-19 have mild cases and recover, doctors still are discovering the coronavirus attacks in far sneakier ways than just causing pneumonia — from blood clots to heart and kidney damage to the latest scare, a life-threatening inflammatory reaction in children.

Whatever the final statistics show about how often it kills, health specialists agree the new coronavirus appears deadlier than the typical flu. Yet the survey suggests a vaccine would be no more popular than the yearly flu shot.

Worldwide, are in early stages of testing or poised to begin. British researchers are opening one of the biggest studies so far, to test an Oxford University-created shot in 10,000 people.

For all the promises of the Trump administration’s “ ,” only 20% of Americans expect any vaccine to be available to the public by year’s end, the poll found. Most think sometime next year is more likely.

Political divisions seen over how the country reopens the economy are reflected in desire for a vaccine, too. More than half of Democrats call a vaccine necessary for reopening, compared to about a third of Republicans. While 62% of Democrats would get the vaccine, only 43% of Republicans say the same.

“There's still a large amount of uncertainty around taking the vaccine,” said Caitlin Oppenheimer, who leads NORC's public health research. “There is a lot of opportunity to communicate with Americans about the value and the safety of a vaccine.”

The AP-NORC poll of 1,056 adults was conducted May 14-18 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

With long time horizons, complex science and high failure rates, vaccine development is not for the faint-hearted philanthropist. But in a world gripped by coronavirus, many donors have put aside such concerns and are writing large cheques in the hope of contributing to the end of the pandemic.

Alibaba founder Jack Ma has promised more than $14m for coronavirus research, while the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has pledged up to $100m to the global response to Covid-19, including funding to accelerate the development of vaccines.

Even the Gates Foundation’s move pales in comparison with the funds now being committed by governments and pharmaceutical companies. In the US alone, the National Institutes of Health, the federal research centres, have secured $1.8bn in additional government funding for Covid-19 work, including vaccine investigations.

Meanwhile the American drugs group Johnson & Johnson is putting $1bn into developing a specific coronavirus vaccine, in a project jointly funded by the US government.

But charitable dollars can still play a crucial role. Philanthropy advisors say donors are free from the burdens of politics that often hamper policymakers and from the profits drive that influences companies (even if, as with J&J’s Covid-19 vaccine, executives claim a particular move is profit-free).

This can allow philanthropists to back very long term research and bring together disparate groups of partners, including universities, research laboratories and other donors.

“We can fund longer timelines than government or industry,” says Heather Youngs, programme officer for scientific research at Open Philanthropy, a research and grant-making organisation. “They have constraints because of the stakeholder groups they have to answer to, whether voters or shareholders. So philanthropy can fill in the gaps.”

An example is Open Philanthropy, where the main funders are Cari Tuna and her husband and Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz. The foundation makes grants to vaccine research centres globally, such as a 2017 award of more than $11m to support research at the University of Washington’s Institute for Protein Design for the development a universal influenza vaccine.

Philanthropy is particularly important in vaccine development because drug companies find it hard to achieve a financial return on the large, long-term investments needed. “You get these glaring market failures, many of them in the vaccine space,” says Mark Suzman, chief executive of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which since inception has committed more than $18bn to the discovery, development and delivery of vaccines.

Suzman cites malaria, which despite being responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths a year, still has no effective vaccine.

“We don’t have malaria problems in rich countries because we have effective prophylaxis: if you visit a malarial zone, you can take pills and you won’t get the disease,” he says. “So there isn’t an incentive for the private sector to put in the billions of dollars that are needed to underwrite a new vaccine.”

And while large pharmaceutical groups were successful in developing an Ebola vaccine, the market — limited largely to a few African countries — was not large enough for them to recover their costs. “In the end they are businesses, and some of them got quite burnt by that,” says Suzman.

When companies do invest, it tends to be in the later stages of vaccine development, says Melissa Stevens, executive director of the Milken Institute Center for Strategic Philanthropy, which advises families, foundations and individual philanthropists.

Charitable dollars can play a critical role in closing the gap between the original research project and delivering a vaccine to the public, perhaps 10-15 years later.

Donors fund the earlier, riskier stages in the journey of vaccines from academia, government labs and entrepreneurial biotech firms to pre-clinical trials and ensuring they meet the regulatory standards needed to enter clinical trials. “That’s where philanthropy can have an outsized impact,” says Stevens.

British philanthropist Richard Ross agrees. He chairs Rosetrees Trust, a fund specialising in medical research established by his late entrepreneur parents, which has distributed nearly £50m since its foundation in 1987.

“A lot of [early research] is basic science, which can be 30 years away from practical application in medicine,” he says. “People come and say I can’t get grant money because I have no data. We can make a difference with one year’s money or three years’ money. That’s an entrepreneurial approach.”

Rosetrees, which has set aside money for Covid-19 research, is considering about 10 projects, including one involving a drug used for brain tumours and another an existing tuberculosis vaccine.

Philanthropists can also fund vaccine-linked education. “You see a growing anti-vaccination movement based in ignorance,” says Amir Pasic, dean of Indiana University’s Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. “You can’t overestimate the importance of education, and I think we’ll see more of that.”

While philanthropists financed vaccine research long before Covid-19 came along, the pandemic has sparked a wave of interest among potential new donors.

Eric Kessler, founder, principal and senior managing director at Arabella Advisors, a US-based philanthropic consultancy, says: “Donors who have historically focused on global health are tripling down right now, and many donors who’ve never focused on global health are getting into the fray for the first time. It’s hard to know how much is going specifically into vaccine research, but we can say it’s significant.”

Kasey Oliver, a director in the consulting practice at philanthropic advisory company Geneva Global, says that as well as reacting to an event such as the Covid-19 pandemic, donors can be motivated by anything from wanting to help eradicate a disease that has killed a family member to wishing to bet on something that could bring long-term change.

However, participating in vaccine research as a philanthropist is not easy. First, it involves complex and emerging science and so means relying on experts. “You need to be willing and able to be flexible and a little hands-off,” says Stevens. “And not everyone goes into their philanthropy with that type of mindset.”

And because it requires the involvement of the private sector, particularly in manufacturing and distribution, donors may face obstacles in ensuring that any successful vaccine can be sold cheaply enough to benefit poor communities.

To address this, in 2003 the Gates Foundation developed its Global Access model for grant contracts. This stipulates that companies or universities that receive its funding must make the resulting treatments widely available at affordable prices. They are also required to share data.

Another challenge for individual philanthropists without the resources of billionaire donors is the sheer amount of money required for vaccine development.

This was among the reasons behind a new collaborative fund, which was launched in January to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging diseases.

With an initial investment of $460m from the German, Japanese and Norwegian governments, the Gates Foundation and the UK’s Wellcome Trust, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations acts as a hub to which any philanthropist can contribute. The group has issued an urgent call for $2bn to develop a Covid-19 vaccine.

Another way for a philanthropist with less money than Gates to help is to create a prize to stimulate academic competition. American philanthropists Gary and Alya Michelson have done just that through the Michelson Prizes. Their annual awards go to young scientists — each winner receiving $150,000 — who are working in new ways on human immunology, vaccine discovery, and immunotherapy research in major global diseases.

At least with prizes, the donors’ names can be recognised. Otherwise, unlike with gifts to an opera house or university building, or even the endowment of an academic post or a scholarship, it is hard to attach a donor’s name to long-term medical research. “Does this appeal to people who want their name on the wall? No,” says Ross.

Moreover, with vaccine projects, as with most long term medical research, there is the likelihood of failure. Few donors want to fund a loser. But developing vaccines, from the pre-clinical phase to production, typically takes more than a decade and has just a 6 per cent probability of making it to market, according to a 2013 study led by researchers at Erasmus University in the Netherlands.

“The trouble with vaccines is they’re expensive,” says Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital. “You need substantial funding and the timelines are pretty long — and often donors, especially the more entrepreneurial donors, want a more immediate return. That’s the toughest part of this.”

But Maria Elena Bottazzi, Hotez’s co-director, argues that even when it results in failure, funding vaccine research is extremely valuable. “It’s transformative, because you are at the same time building the next generation of innovators and scientists,” she says.

And, as the coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated, success can have a social and economic impact that is global. “Where would we be right now if we had a vaccine for Covid-19?” says Oliver. “Vaccines are game changers. They reshape the world — imagine if that was part of your philanthropic legacy.”",mainstream,M0ae25,vaccine

890,"When could a COVID-19 vaccine be ready?

Top health officials say the end of this year would be a best case scenario. But scientists have never created a vaccine so quickly, and there’s no guarantee any under development will ultimately work.

Worldwide, testing recently started or is about to start for about a dozen potential vaccines. The most promising vaccine candidates are expected to move into larger tests this summer.

How quickly those studies can determine whether the vaccines are safe and effective depends in part on how widely the coronavirus is still spreading. The studies will need to enroll 20,000 people or more for each vaccine candidate, with half of them getting the real vaccine and the rest getting a dummy shot. Then it’s a matter of waiting to see how many in each group become infected with the virus.

Answers will come faster if volunteers are recruited in places where outbreaks are worsening, a trend that can be hard to predict.

One way to speed up distribution is to start manufacturing doses before test results are in. But it’s a gamble that could mean throwing away tons of vaccines that fail.

727,"CDC whistleblower: “We were ordered to cover up vaccine-autism link” (VIDEO)

This video contains an extraordinary conversation for extraordinary times. Biblical times, really. When the lie becomes the truth and the truth becomes a lie. These days, lying is not just okey dokey, nor is it an occasional little white one – there’s no such thing. It is not merely the flavor for the month. It is all of the above, and so much more. It’s the new American tradition. Now it’s politically correct to remove Native American names from sports teams. Don’t talk about small pox blankets and decimating buffalo from the windows of steam engine trains. Just remove a word, no worries. No harm done. Withholding evidence is also a lie. Change the message, bury the truth. Like around fourteen years ago, when men and women destroyed the evidence of Merck’s MMR vaccine showing a causal relationship with autism, with increased risk reserved for African American male children. Corrupted souls filled with fraud, deception, flat out lying to Congress and themselves did not have the mindset of “do no harm.” CDC scientists destroyed the proof that children injected with the MMR vaccine could very well have a full cognitive life taken from them via autism. If truth were told, their profits and brotherhood would suffer, so, no worries, just destroy the evidence and go on your merry way. Change a word or two. Allow another slaughter of the innocent begin. And when the truth starts to trickle out it is ignored, suppressed or mocked. But the truth cannot be contained. Here’s an except from the Dr. Andrew Wakefield’s interview with Alex Jones:

Mother Nature's micronutrient secret: Organic Broccoli Sprout Capsules now available, delivering 280mg of high-density nutrition, including the extraordinary ""sulforaphane"" and ""glucosinolate"" nutrients found only in cruciferous healing foods. Every lot laboratory tested. See availability here.

“I’m twenty years into this battle, and it could have continued the way it was going, until one man stepped forward, [William Thompson] a senior scientist, a CDC insider saying, “I was in charge of a study where we tested a hypotheses and we found the MMR vaccination was causally associated with autism and we hid the findings. We hid it for fourteen years and we have know for fourteen years that this vaccine is causally associated with autism and we have concealed it. We’ve put millions of Americas children in harms way and I can live with that no longer.”

It’s a note of hope that a man no longer can live with his lie. So he turns away and walks a new direction. That’s called repentance. America must follow suite.

464,"Mercury from vaccines seems to disappear rapidly from the blood, returning to pre-vaccination levels in one month, according to a small study of children in Argentina.

The findings bolster the argument that a mercury-based vaccine preservative doesn't cause autism in children, although it's unclear from the study whether some mercury may linger elsewhere in the body.

The research addresses an unanswered question about the safety of thimerosal, a preservative that has been eliminated from routine U.S. vaccines, and breaks down as ethyl mercury in the body. It is still used in other countries, including Argentina.

Scientists assumed the health risks from ethyl mercury were similar to methyl mercury from eating fish. And in 1999, the federal government and vaccine manufacturers agreed that thimerosal should be reduced or eliminated in vaccines to lower exposure to mercury from all sources. The decision was based on what was known about methyl mercury exposure.

The new findings suggest that methyl mercury and ethyl mercury are very different and that the removal of thimerosal from vaccines may have been over-cautious.

""The study supports the decision by the World Health Organization to continue to permit thimerosal to remain in vaccines for the world's children,"" said study co-author Dr. Michael Pichichero of the University of Rochester in Rochester, N.Y. He said thimerosal vaccines are cheaper to produce and therefore more accessible to much of the world.

In the U.S.-funded study, blood samples were taken from 216 healthy babies before and after they got vaccines containing the preservative thimerosal. Blood levels of mercury were highest shortly after the babies were vaccinated and fell to pre-vaccination levels within a few weeks.

""The amount found in the blood was about one-tenth of that predicted in that the late 1990s and the length of time it stays in the blood is one-tenth of that predicted,"" Pichichero said.

Mercury levels also were measured in the babies' stools and urine. In the stool samples, the levels were highest after vaccination and also fell, but more slowly than blood levels. There was no significant amount of mercury in the urine.

The authors could not determine what happened to all the mercury after it left the blood. All the infants gave samples twice: before vaccination and at one other time, ranging from 12 hours later to 30 days.

The study will be published in the February issue of the journal Pediatrics. The medical journal released the findings early because of a controversy surrounding a new TV series premiering Thursday, which features a lawyer who argues in court that a flu vaccine made a child autistic.

The journal is published by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which on Monday called on ABC to cancel the first episode of the series, ""Eli Stone,"" saying that it perpetuates the myth that vaccines can cause autism.

Autism is a complex disorder featuring repetitive behaviors and poor social interaction and communication skills. Scientists generally believe that genetics plays a role in causing the disorder; a theory that thimerosal is to blame has been repeatedly discounted in scientific studies.

Pichichero said he has received research grants and served as a consultant to several vaccine makers, but said there was no industry involvement in the new study. He is an unpaid consultant to the WHO on vaccines.",mainstream,M0b7d7,vaccine.autism
1037,"Brain scans, analyzed using a type of artificial intelligence, can reveal whether 6-month-old babies are likely to develop autism, a new study shows.

The study examined 59 infants who were at high risk of developing autism; that is, each had an older sibling with autism. The artificial intelligence predicted with 100 percent accuracy that 48 infants would not develop autism. In addition, of the 11 infants who did develop the disorder by the time they were 2 years old, the system correctly predicted nine of the cases.

""It was extremely accurate,"" Robert Emerson, the lead author on the study and a former cognitive neuroscience postdoctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina (UNC), told Live Science. [5 Things That May Cause Autism]

Studies show that 20 percent of babies who have older siblings with autism will develop the disorder; among babies in the general population, 1.5 percent develop autism, Emerson told Live Science.

The results of the new research could lead to new diagnostic tools that identify autism before symptoms occur, giving clinicians the opportunity to intervene early, the researchers said.

""The idea is that we can be more effective if we can get to these kids before they develop autism, perhaps ameliorating or preventing it,"" Dr. Joseph Piven, a professor of psychiatry at the UNC School of Medicine and director of the Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities, told Live Science. The researchers published their results today (June 7) in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

Autism spectrum disorder, a brain-based disorder characterized by a wide range of social-communication challenges and repetitive behaviors, affects about one out of every 68 children in the United States. Behavioral symptoms typically begin to appear in children at around age 2.

Emerson and his colleagues demonstrated that they could identify biomarkers for the disorder before the symptoms occur.

As part of their study, the researchers used MRI scanners to image the brains of the infants while they slept. During the scans, the researchers recorded the neural activity of 230 different regions in the brain, looking particularly at whether or not pairs of these region — referred to as functional connections — were synchronized with each other, and if so, to what extent.

In total, the researchers measured 26,335 functional connections crucial for cognition, memory and behavior.

When the children reached age 2, they came back in for a behavior assessment. The researchers looked at the children's social interactions, communication, motor development and tendency to perform repetitive actions, and determined whether each child had autism. [11 Facts Every Parent Should Know About Their Baby's Brain]

With all of the data in hand, the researchers set out to first train their machine learning program, and then use it to run predictions. They wanted to see how accurately it could predict which infants had developed autism, using only the functional connections data from when the children were 6 months old. In other words, although the researchers knew which babies had developed into toddlers with autism and which had not, the machine learning program did not.

Machine learning is a kind of artificial intelligence system that gets smarter based on the data it processes. In this case, the program was learning to spot differences between the functional connections imaged in the MRI data collected at 6 months old that correlate with cognition, memory and behavior and the details from the behavioral assessments collected at 24 months.

As the program did this, it separated the children into two groups — those with autism and those without the condition. Once it was trained, it could make predictions. [7 Baby Myths Debunked]

But during the training process, the researchers didn't use the data from all 59 kids. Instead, they fed data in from 58 of the 59 infants to train the model, and then to get the prediction, they inputed the data from the one infant they had left out. They repeated this for all 59 children.

""Each child was predicted separately based on a model from the other children in the group,"" Emerson said.

In the end, the machine learning program was correct in 82 percent of the cases in which the children did develop autism.

Piven said the team published a study earlier in the year that also showed an impressive prediction rate, but that study required two MRI scans, one at 6 months of age and one at 1 year. Moving the needle to an earlier age is a big advance, Piven said.

The research team was amazed by the parents who participated in this and other studies over the years, given all that was required, he said.

""This is an extraordinary group of people,"" Piven said. ""Not only do they have an older child with autism, but they bring their babies, often multiple times and from very far away, to one of our four clinical sites around the country.""

The researchers said they hope their contributions will lead to more effective interventions for children on the brink of developing autism.",mainstream,M09dc7,vaccine.autism
802,"A large measles outbreak occurred in South Wales in 2012/2013. The outbreak has been attributed to low take-up of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) immunization in the early 2000s. To understand better the factors that led to this outbreak we present the findings of a case-control study carried out in the outbreak area in 2001 to investigate parents' decision on whether to accept MMR. Parents who decided not to take-up MMR at the time were more likely to be older and better educated, more likely to report being influenced by newspapers [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3·07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·62–5·80], television (aOR 3·30, 95% CI 1·70–6·43), the internet (aOR 7·23, 3·26–16·06) and vaccine pressure groups (aOR 5·20, 95% CI 2·22–12·16), and less likely to be influenced by a health visitor (aOR 0·30, 95% CI 0·16–0·57). In this area of Wales, daily English-language regional newspapers, UK news programmes and the internet appeared to have a powerful negative influence. We consider the relevance of these findings to the epidemiology of the outbreak and the subsequent public health response.",mainstream,M0b39d,vaccine.autism
48,"While the world is firmly in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic, we take a look back at SARS and MERS and their underlying pathogens, which are also coronaviruses. Three new coronaviruses have emerged since the turn of the century. All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 outbreak. Coronaviruses are a large family of enveloped RNA viruses that mostly infect birds and mammals. In humans, they can cause mild infection in the upper respiratory tract, like the common cold, but also more serious lower respiratory tract infections. These infections can manifest as bronchitis, pneumonia, or a severe respiratory illness, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), or coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). But how similar are the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 coronaviruses? And how do the diseases compare? In this feature, we explore the history of each coronavirus outbreak, as well as the statistics and medical advances. Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment.

The coronavirus that causes SARS is called SARS-CoV. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the first cluster of SARS cases occurred in China’s Guangdong province in November 2002. Research has identified horseshoe bats as the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV. Civets and animals in wet markets also likely contributed to the virus crossing from animals into humans. The organization was first notified, of more than 100 deaths due to a new infectious disease, on February 10, 2003. The next day, the Chinese health ministry made an official report of 300 cases and five deaths due to an acute respiratory syndrome. On March 12, 2003, the WHO issued a global alert, warning of atypical pneumonia spreading among hospital staff. A mere 3 days later, the WHO coined the name SARS and put out an emergency travel advisory, asking travelers to be familiar with the symptoms of the condition. They also proposed that the disease was spreading throughout the world by people using air transport. Later in March, the WHO recommended that airports in areas with cases of SARS screen passengers. From April of that year onward, the WHO issued a number of warnings, asking people to postpone all but essential travel to affected areas. These areas included, at various times, Hong Kong, Toronto, several areas of mainland China, and Taiwan. A paper published May 15, 2003 in The New England Journal of Medicine identified a new coronavirus as the underlying pathogen. The WHO officially declared the SARS epidemic to be contained on July 5 of that year. Since then, there have been four small outbreaks of SARS. Of these, three involved people who worked with the SARS virus in laboratory settings and acquired the virus accidentally. The fourth incidence has been mostly attributed to infection from an animal source. There have been no reported cases of SARS since then, although the WHO warn that “These events demonstrate that the resurgence of SARS leading to an outbreak remains a distinct possibility and does not allow for complacency.”
• Total number of cases: 8,439, 21% of which developed in healthcare workers
• Number of cases in the United States: 73
• Mode of transmission: Droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, talking, or breathing
• Key symptoms: A cough (dry at first), a fever, and diarrhea in the first or second week of illness, or both

MERS occurs as a result of infection with the coronavirus MERS-CoV. 



On September 20, 2012, the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases reported a novel coronavirus isolated from sputum samples of a 60-year-old man from Saudi Arabia, who had died 3 months earlier. Within the next month, the number of confirmed MERS cases rose to nine, with five fatalities. The earliest case dated back to April 2012. Across the globe, 27 countries have reported cases of MERS since 2012, but around 80% of cases have occurred in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus, meaning that most cases of infection pass from animals to humans. According to the WHO, direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels is the most common route of infection. Transmission among people is rare, and it mostly occurs among family members or in healthcare settings. The MERS-CoV virus has similarities to European bat coronaviruses.
• Number of cases in the U.S.: 2
• Mode of transmission: Droplets from person to person, unclear from camels to humans
• At risk groups: Men above the age of 60, particularly those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and kidney failure

The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the pathogen that causes COVID-19. The virus has a close resemblance to SARS-CoV. The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. On January 5, 2020, the WHO published the first news of an outbreak of unknown cause. By the end of January, the organization had declared COVID-19 to be a public health emergency of international concern. The name COVID-19 was officially coined, by the WHO, on February 11. Exactly 1 month later, the organization declared a pandemic. To date, cases of COVID-19 have been reported on every continent except Antarctica. Governments across the world have responded with varying degrees of social distancing measures in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. As the numbers of infections and deaths from COVID-19 continue to rise, researchers are working to identify suitable treatments and vaccines to curb the pandemic.
• Number of cases in the U.S.: 432,438
• Mode of transmission: Droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking, limited evidence of other routes
• At risk groups: Adults aged 65 and over, and people of all ages with underlying medical conditions
• Treatment: No specific treatment, although several candidate drugs are undergoing testing
• Vaccine: No vaccine, although several candidate vaccines are in development

Each of the three new coronaviruses that has emerged since the turn of the century has caused respiratory disease outbreaks, but each has also displayed unique features. SARS and MERS have significantly higher case fatality rates than COVID-19. Yet COVID-19 is more infectious — the underlying SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads more easily among people, leading to greater case numbers. 



Despite the lower case fatality rate, the overall number of deaths from COVID-19 far outweighs that from SARS or MERS. There have been no cases of SARS for over a decade. But MERS is an ongoing public health concern. One factor that could contribute to the extent of damage that any new coronavirus can cause is globalization. As infectious disease specialist and WHO advisor Prof. David Heymann told Medical News Today in an interview: “In the past, coronaviruses that cause the common cold in humans also emerged, possibly in the same way as did the current pandemic.” “But they did not have the opportunity to hop on international flights and spread rapidly around the globe,” he continued. “They likely circulated locally and then gradually spread to neighboring countries and onward throughout the world.” For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.",mainstream,M093b9,vaccine
1075,"Yet another study has found that a controversial vaccine preservative appears to be harmless. But the study is unlikely to end the increasingly charged debate about vaccine safety.

The study examined whether thimerosal — a mercury-containing vaccine preservative that was almost entirely eliminated from childhood vaccines by 2002 — is associated with neurological or certain psychological problems in children ages 7 to 10.

Some parents’ groups and prominent legislators contend that thimerosal has caused an epidemic of childhood autism. Several studies have examined this question and found no evidence that thimerosal is associated with autism.

The most recent study did not assess thimerosal’s association with autism directly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is conducting a separate autism and thimerosal study that is expected to be published next year.",mainstream,M0b7a3,vaccine.autism
184,"A sign warns people of measles in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in Williamsburg on April 10, 2019 in New York City.

Health officials confirmed another 41 measles cases last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday, bringing the total to 880 for 2019, already the worst year for the disease since 1994.

The CDC said it has now confirmed measles in 24 states this year. While the total number continued to rise, the pace appears to be slowing down — although the agency will need to see if the trend continues before it can officially say the spread is slowing, a spokesman said.

Thirty of the 41 new cases were reported in New York, where health officials have battled two large outbreaks since the fall. In New York City, 21 new cases were reported. In nearby Rockland County, nine new cases were reported, the CDC said.

Health officials blame the recent surge of cases — after saying in 2000 that the disease had been eliminated from the U.S. — on an increasing number of parents who refuse to vaccinate their children.

Measles is highly contagious yet preventable with a vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella. More parents are refusing to vaccinate their children, sometimes based on false information that vaccines cause autism.

The disease spreads quickly and easily among people who aren't immunized, leaving communities with high rates of people who aren't protected particularly vulnerable.

Measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat. It then causes a rash. Some people develop severe complications, such as pneumonia or brain swelling. Children younger than 5 and adults older than 20 are more likely to experience complications, the CDC says.

The disease is still common in other countries. Unvaccinated people can pick up the disease while traveling and bring it back to the U.S., where they can spread it to other unvaccinated people.",mainstream,M07d54,vaccine.autism
1227,"Thursday’s World Malaria Day arrived with some good news stories: the large-scale launch of a pioneering vaccine in Malawi is just one promising fresh approach to tackling the disease. Others include the introduction of better bednets, insecticides and diagnostics, new drugs to respond to the continuing threat of resistance and the potential through “gene-drive” technology to wipe out the mosquito that transmits the parasite between humans.

There has been some progress towards ending the disease among the 21 countries targeted for its elimination by next year. Yet the trend is less impressive in some of the highest burden countries such as Nigeria and there is backsliding elsewhere, notably in Venezuela, where government failures are undermining the health system and imposing a heavy human burden.

Much work still needs to be done to improve the data on malaria’s impact, notably to help countries focus their resources. But it is clear that global progress has stagnated, with around 200m annual cases and at least 430,000 deaths imposing a heavy human and financial toll.

There is limited potential or appetite for private sector funding mechanisms and in the build-up to “replenishment” fundraisings for international funding agencies this year, the monies invested remain far below the levels estimated to be necessary to tackle the disease.

Abdourahmane Diallo, former health minister of Guinea and newly appointed chief executive of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership.

What is your interest in malaria?

I’m originally from Guinea and I couldn’t say how many times I’ve had malaria since I was a child. I’m a medical doctor by training and had an international public health career focused on developing countries. I worked for [US consultancy] JSI and the US President’s Malaria Initiative. I became minister of health in 2016 and when I finished I wanted to go back into public health and help tackle a disease with a global dimension.

What are your priorities at RBM?

We are at a critical phase in the fight against malaria. With the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and Malaria replenishment this year, we will step up the fight. My priority is to really call on all governments to play their part. To make the biggest difference, we need to help the highest malaria-burden countries get back on track through four key responses: political will, strategic data to drive impact, better guidance on up-to-date scientifically proven approaches, and a co-ordinated response.

What is the likelihood of ending malaria?

We believe it is possible to end malaria within our lifetime. But there has to be a global collective effort from all angles with all stakeholders to make it happen. Our theme is “malaria starts with me”. We are calling on pretty much everyone to contribute: political leaders to maintain their commitment to funding; the private sector; and the citizens of every country to play their part themselves, by teaching others and holding their political leaders accountable.

Greta Thunberg, the 16-year old climate change activist and Asperger’s sufferer, has taken the world by storm, but too many people with autism still face cruel treatment. (The Guardian)",mainstream,M08ea3,vaccine.autism
1269,"“Leaky gut autism theory doubted”, was the headline from BBC News on March 17 2008. The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail also reported that researchers have found no evidence to support the ’leaky gut theory’. They say that this theory proposes that vaccines such as MMR damage the intestine causing digestive problems, leading to the production of peptides “which can damage the brain and possibly cause autism”.

This well conducted study used reliable analysis techniques to compare autistic children across a broad range of intelligences to age-matched control children. Despite the newspaper headlines and coverage, the study did not look at the effects of the MMR jab and autism. Instead, it tested and compared the urine of autistic boys with the urine of boys without autism. The researchers conclude that there were no differences between the levels of peptides in the groups and say they have effectively disproved the ’leaky gut theory‘. However, further research is needed to establish whether a casein and gluten-free diet has other effects on autism.

The researchers call for more studies into special diet as a treatment for autism, but they do not suggest that their research has any implication for the discredited MMR vaccine/autism theory.

Where did the story come from?

Dr Hilary Cass from the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and colleagues from around England and Scotland carried out the research. The authors acknowledge the support of the research and development fund of the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh and the Chief Scientist Office in Scotland. Competing interests were declared. The study was published in Archives of Disease in Childhood, a peer-reviewed medical journal.

What kind of scientific study was this?

This was a case control study that compared 65 boys with autism, aged between five and 11 years, with 158 control boys of a similar age.

The researchers say that, for a number of years, it has been thought that the urine of children with autism contains opioid peptides that originate from outside the body. Opioid peptides are chemical compounds that are so called because they resemble morphine. They can be produced by the body and through the digestion of foods such as grain and milk. Grains such as wheat, rye, barley and oats contain the protein gluten, that produces opioid peptides in the gut, while milk produces another variety, casein.

One theory for the development of autism is the ’leaky gut theory‘: the idea that children with autism become sensitive to gluten. The gluten is thought to inflame the small bowel. The resulting damage allows opioid peptides from food to be absorbed into the blood and then enter the urine. Before the opioid peptides in the blood are excreted they are assumed to cross into the brain and result in the symptoms of autism. Previous research has proposed that excluding casein and gluten (milk and grains) from the diet might help children with autism by reducing the amount of circulating opioid peptides.

The theory proposes that opioid peptides found in urine reflect a disturbance in the integrity of the gut epithelium (i.e. a leaky gut). Proponents of the theory hope that the peptides can act as a diagnostic marker for autism and predict that a diet excluding gluten and casein could help to treat children with autistic symptoms.

This study aimed to determine the occurrence of the peptides in the urine of children who have autism and those who do not. The researchers recruited 65 boys from two hospitals specialising in autistic spectrum disorders in London. For the control group, 202 non-autistic boys of similar age were recruited from mainstream infant and primary schools in the same area. A questionnaire was given to the parents of the controls to ‘screen out’ children with possible neurological or psychiatric difficulties. Forty of the controls were excluded from the study as their parents did not complete the questionnaire, or the boys’ results were abnormal or borderline.

Urine samples were collected from all the children and analysed using equipment that separates the chemical in a liquid (HPLC). Other equipment was used to identify small and fragile biological molecules, such as the opioid peptides (MALDI-TOF MS).

What were the results of the study?

The researchers say that their study finds no evidence of opioid peptides in the urine of boys with autism or similar disorders.

After adjusting for the amount of creatinine in the urine, which is a measure of kidney function, the researchers found no significant differences in the urinary profiles (shown by HPLC) between groups of boys with or without autism. In those cases where HPLC showed peaks in the locations at which opioid peptides might be expected to be found, further testing by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) showed that these peaks did not represent opioid peptides.

What interpretations did the researchers draw from these results?

The researchers say that “given the lack of evidence for any opioid peptiduria in children with autism it can neither serve as a biomedical marker for autism, nor be employed to predict or monitor response to a casein and gluten exclusion diet”.

The researchers say that these findings effectively disprove the ’leaky gut theory‘, which predicts that these proteins should be found in the urine of autistic children. They suggest that healthcare professionals and parents should stop testing children with autism for urinary opioid peptides, and note that commercial laboratories around the world still widely advertise these tests on the internet.

What does the NHS Knowledge Service make of this study?

This study has a number of strengths. The researchers used accepted and applied definitions of autism and selected children across a broad range of intelligence. The urine testing appears to have been conducted reliably and the researchers further analysed the peptide peaks found by chromatography (HPLC) with advanced mass spectroscopy techniques (MALDI-TOF). They acknowledge some limitations, however, including:
• The autistic children were selected from tertiary or specialist centres. This may mean that they had more severe autism than that commonly found in the community.
• It was not possible to match the autistic children with low IQ to control children with the same level of IQ. Strictly speaking, this means that the groups were not balanced at the start of the study. However, as no significant differences were found in the peptide levels between any of the groups that were examined, it is unlikely that a link would have been found between peptide levels and IQ either.

The researchers say that there is no evidence that opioid peptides can leak through the gut and cause autism in children. However, further research is needed to establish whether a casein and gluten-free diet has other effects on autism.

The researchers do not comment on any implications of their study with regard to the MMR vaccine. Immunisation is topical and attracts the reader’s attention, but well-designed research into other theories of how autism is caused is needed.",mainstream,M078a1,vaccine.autism
1139,"In the American political system, lobbying is par for the course. It has come to be expected that major industries, and the leading corporations in those industries, will seek to influence legislation, regulation, and the enforcement of government decisions, such that they receive preferential treatment. This could come in the form of campaign contributions, or actual lobbying, with a lobbyist working on behalf of the corporation that has paid them to influence a particular vote or governmental decision. What it is they are lobbying for, though, is a more involved question.

Here, using data from opensecrets.org, we break down lobbying efforts, industry by industry, combining all political contributions and lobbying spending from Jan. 1998 to March 31, 2020. Figures are calculations by the Center for Responsive Politics based on data from the Senate Office of Public Records.

Let's take a closer look at how much each industry spends on lobbying, the top corporate spenders in each category, and what spurs their lobbying efforts.

Spending $4.45 billion over the past 22 years, the pharmaceutical and health products industry has far outpaced all other industries in lobbying spending. It's important to note that this industry includes not only drug manufacturers, but also the sellers of medical products and nutritional and dietary supplements. From Jan. 2020 through March 2020, spending was topped by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and Pfizer Inc.

Overall, the industry is primarily concerned with ""resisting government-run health care, ensuring a quicker approval process for drugs and products entering the market, and strengthening intellectual property protections.” In recent years, lobbying has focused more specifically “on the patent system, research funding, and Medicare.” As is to be expected, lobbying efforts reached a fever pitch in 2009, around the drafting of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and reported a high in 2017 with legislative enactments again focusing on changes to health care.

Including health, property, and car insurance companies, along with agents and brokers, the insurance industry has historically been the second most generous/aggressive industry in lobbying for their interests. In 2019, spending was $155.3 million. Following the passage of the ACA and subsequent developments under the Trump administration, health insurance companies have been very involved in the legislative process, looking to influence new regulations. In 2019, the leading insurance industry lobbyist corporation was Blue Cross/Blue Shield.

The electric utilities industry monitors legislative and regulatory action taken on a number of fronts, including clean air regulation, waste storage, cybersecurity, and infrastructure. The top lobbyist in electric utilities as of March 2020 is Duke Energy.

These are your classic software and hardware computer tech companies, some of the founders of the tech movement that exists today. As this industry has become increasingly profitable, its political contributions have increased. The industry is relatively non-partisan, usually given to each party evenly, with slight favoring to the party in the White House.

Given the ubiquity of hardware and software, and tech more generally, it makes sense that lobbying from the electronics sector is varied, with lobbying efforts on homeland security, taxes, copyright, immigration, human rights, cybersecurity, and law enforcement data storage. As of March 2020, the top lobbying spenders were Qualcomm Inc and Microsoft Corp.

This grouping includes small business, pro-business, and international trade associations, as well as chambers of commerce. Business associations lobby on issues like labor regulations, intellectual property, product safety, and taxes, but mostly, lobbying efforts have focused on civil justice system reform.

Business associations want to make sure that damages awarded to plaintiffs involving torts or wrongful acts that led to legal liabilities are limited (asbestos, medical malpractice, etc.). Other important legal issues include business tax reform, including corporate tax policy and taxation of U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies. The top business association lobbyist in 2019 was the U.S Chamber of Commerce.

As you might imagine, the oil and gas lobbying sector is one of the most active lobbying groups. Lobbyist efforts have historically focused on promoting legislators with pro-energy views in the areas of fossil fuel production, commodity exploration, and extraction. As of March 2020, the top lobbying spenders in the industry were Chevron Corp, Koch Industries, and Exxon Mobil.

With spending of nearly $1.9 billion in lobbying efforts over the past 22 years, miscellaneous manufacturing and distributing is an influential force in legislation and governmental regulation. The sector has members like Honeywell International, General Electric, Cummins Inc., 3M, and Procter & Gamble, and its lobbying interests and efforts reflect this wide array. Having spent $3.4 million from Jan. 2020 through March 2020, the National Association of Manufacturers is the industry’s top lobbyist.

This category includes all healthcare institutions—hospitals, nursing homes, hospice providers, and drug and alcohol inpatient centers. Lobbying in this industry was especially active in 2009 and again in 2017 with legislative actions involving health care and the Affordable Care Act.

At present, lobbyist efforts in the sector are generally focused on cost management, insurance allocations, spending on employee training, prevention of physician pay reductions, and costs associated with Medicaid and Medicare.

1213,"On March 23, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown to contain the coronavirus epidemic, despite British health officials quietly lowering the official threat level for the pandemic just days earlier. The UK government website reads: “As of 19 March 2020, COVID-19 is no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious diseases (HCID) in the UK.”

Just days before U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown to contain the coronavirus epidemic, health officials in Britain quietly lowered the official threat level for the pandemic, saying the COVID-19 virus did not meet the criteria to qualify as a “high consequence infectious disease” (HCID).

U.K. health officials had tentatively identified COVID-19 as an HCID in late January, but said in a March 19 statement it was rescinding its interim decision.

“This was based on consideration of the U.K. HCID criteria about the virus and the disease with information available during the early stages of the outbreak,” the statement said.

“Now that more is known about COVID-19, the public health bodies in the UK have … determined that several features have now changed; in particular, more information is available about mortality rates (low overall), and there is now greater clinical awareness and a specific and sensitive laboratory test, the availability of which continues to increase.”

The statement said a government body that deals with pathogens agreed the virus did not merit the HCID designation, but also added that the risk to the U.K from the outbreak “has been raised to high.”",conspiracy,C00bb3,coronavirus; covid.19; planned.parenthood; vaccine.covid
650,"(CNN) As the world works to produce an effective Covid-19 vaccine , some experts suggest an existing vaccine that almost everyone already gets might help.

There is plenty of evidence that existing vaccines such as polio vaccines protect children against a wide range of infections and it's worth trying them out against the new coronavirus , a team of experts wrote in Science magazine Thursday.

An oral polio vaccine is safe, cheap, easy to give and widely available, with more than 1 billion doses produced and used annually in more than 140 countries, according to the team, which includes one of the scientists who discovered HIV and a vaccine expert from the Food and Drug Administration. The vaccine has nearly eradicated polio worldwide.

The oral polio vaccine uses a weakened version of the polio virus. The live attenuated vaccines produce a strong and long-lasting immune response, vaccine experts said. They're slower to manufacture than modern vaccines that just use a piece of genetic material from a virus, and the US and European companies working on coronavirus vaccines are focusing on quicker ways.

It would make sense to at least test it to see i f it helps against coronavirus, said Konstantin Chumakov of the FDA and Dr. Robert Gallo of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, along with their colleagues.

Gallo co-discovered the virus that causes AIDS while Chumakov is associate director for research at the FDA's vaccine division.

""We propose the use of OPV (oral poliovirus vaccine ) to ameliorate or prevent COVID-19. Both poliovirus and coronavirus are positive-strand RNA viruses; therefore, it is likely that they may induce and be affected by common innate immunity mechanisms,"" they wrote. "" ... Oral poliovirus vaccine in particular, could provide temporary protection against coronavirus disease.""

The oral polio vaccine produces herd effects, they wrote. Herd immunity is reached when the majority of a given population -- 70% to 90% -- becomes immune to an infectious disease, either because they have become infected and recovered, or through vaccination.

In addition to protecting vulnerable individuals, it could also prevent the spread of the new coronavirus by increasing the proportion of unsusceptible individuals, Chumakov, Gallo and colleagues wrote.

""The risk of complications due to OPV is extremely low,"" they added. It can cause a polio-like complication, but only in about one out of every 3 million doses given, and then mostly in immunocompromised children.

Doctors know that the benefits of vaccination extend beyond the particular germs targeted.

""Other live attenuated viral vaccines such as those against measles and smallpox have also been associated with pronounced nonspecific protective effects against infectious diseases,"" they wrote.

""In Africa, when measles vaccine was introduced in the community, the overall mortality in children declined by more than 50%, a reduction that was far larger than anticipated on the basis of the protection against measles deaths alone,"" they added.

The OPV is no longer licensed or available in the United States, but is still used in some parts of the world, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Children get vaccine doses by drops in the mouth.",mainstream,M08198,coronavirus; vaccine; vaccine.covid
51,"The number of measles cases in the United States has reached a 25-year peak, propelled by the spread of misinformation about the vaccine that can prevent the disease, federal health officials said on Monday.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 704 cases as of April 26, a 1.3 percent increase since the most recent tally of 695 reported on Wednesday. The vast majority of cases have occurred in children who have not received the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, which confers immunity to the disease, officials said.

""The suffering we are seeing today is completely avoidable,"" US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on Monday. ""We know vaccines are safe because they're among some of the most studied medical products we have.""

A vocal fringe of US parents refuses to vaccinate their children believing, contrary to scientific evidence, that ingredients in them can cause autism or other disorders.

According to the CDC, 94 percent of children entering kindergarten in the US in 2017 had received their two doses of the MMR vaccine.

Some 22 states have recorded cases of the extremely contagious and sometimes deadly disease.

None of the victims of the recent outbreak has died, but three percent have contracted pneumonia and nine percent have been hospitalised due to complications from the disease, CDC director Robert Redfield said on Monday.

US President Donald Trump urged Americans last week to get vaccinated to prevent the spread of measles, changing course from remarks he made in 2014 when he expressed doubt about giving children government-recommended doses of vaccines.

""The vaccinations are so important. This is really going around now,"" Trump said on Friday.

There were 17 measles outbreaks in 2018, but most of the cases were from outbreaks in New York state, New York City, and New Jersey.

The current outbreak has been concentrated in New York City, where officials said more than 390 cases have been recorded since October, mostly among children in Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn.

The national outbreak has escalated since 82 people in 2018 and more than 40 people in 2019 brought measles to the US from other countries, most frequently Ukraine, Israel and the Philippines, federal officials said.

Although the virus was eliminated from the country in 2000, meaning it was no longer continually present year-round, outbreaks still happen via travellers coming from countries where measles is still common, the CDC says.",mainstream,M0779e,vaccine.autism

554,"The drug maker Sanofi Pasteur is entering the race to develop a vaccine to protect against the new coronavirus sweeping through China, the company announced Monday.

David Loew, Sanofi’s global head of vaccines, announced the company would partner with the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority—known as BARDA—to make a vaccine using the company’s recombinant DNA platform.

Loew said the company’s previous work to develop a vaccine for SARS—a cousin virus—gives it a leg up on this work.

“Addressing a global health threat such as this newest coronavirus is going to take a collaborative effort, which is why we are working with BARDA to quickly advance a potential vaccine candidate,” said Loew.

“While we are lending our expertise where possible, we believe the collaboration with BARDA may provide the most meaningful results in protecting the public from this latest outbreak,” he said.

Loew said the company expects to have a vaccine candidate—a prototype—to test in vitro within six months and could be ready to test the vaccine in people within a year or 18 months.

Loew noted the DNA recombinant platform is already used to make flu vaccine licensed in the U.S., which means regulators are familiar with it. Sanofi also has large-scale manufacturing capacity for these types of vaccines.

Sanofi is the second major vaccine maker to announce it will try to make a vaccine against the new virus, which has infected over 70,000 people, mostly in China. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine division, Janssen, has also announced it will try to make a vaccine.

527,"Flu vaccines, according to the best scientific evidence available today, will only work against 10% of the circulating viruses that cause the symptoms of seasonal epidemic influenza. Additionally, flu vaccines have been found to elicit inflammatory reactions that may harm the human heart, the developing fetus, and the fragile immune systems of our infants. So, do the theoretical benefits really outweigh the known harms?

In a recent article, The Shocking Lack of Evidence Supporting Flu Vaccines, we addressed the surprising lack of empirical evidence supporting the use of flu vaccines in the prevention of seasonal influenza, in children under two, healthy adults, the elderly, and healthcare workers who care for the elderly.

The reality is that vaccines not only do not work as advertised, but they represent a significant health threat, likely on the same order of magnitude as influenza itself, due to their well-known role in compromising immunological self-tolerance (autoimmunity), as well as by eliciting a wide range of adverse health effects associated with the use of adjuvants, preservatives, foreign animal DNA and cell byproducts, adventitious viruses, and other so-called “inactive ingredients,” including even the unnatural route and method of antigen administration itself.[i]

Basic Virology Facts Reveal Trivalent Flu Vaccines Are At Best 10% Effective

But it shouldn’t take expensive, elaborate, time-consuming research to grasp the obvious limitations in effectiveness of flu vaccines from the perspective of this fundamental fact of influenza virology:

Indeed, if facts like these were not so commonly ignored or denied, and it was the actuallyclinically-confirmed, unequivocal “evidence” that drove the so-called “evidence-based” medical system into its annual, seasonal influenza-induced, frenzy of pro-vaccine propagandizing and proselytizing, we might look at this ritual of mass vaccination as something other than just a profit-, policy-, and, for the masses, faith-based indoctrination, which sadly it has become.

“Science-Based” Medicine Unwilling To Look At Empirical Evidence On Vaccine Harms

Similarly, were those self-avowed “skeptics,” and would-be advocates of “science-based medicine,” who claim vaccinating is always safer and more effective than not vaccinating, to acknowledge research indicating the limitations and increasing failings of vaccination, as well as the value of natural influenza flu alternatives,* they might someday earn the right to use powerful-sounding words like “Science” and “Evidence” in their crusade against your access to the empirical truth and your right to bodily self-possession, i.e. your right to make free and informed decisions for yourself to engage or disengage from medical interventions, that carry a known risk of harm and even death.

The reality is that many top biomedical journals cannot and will not suppress the truth concerning the many unintended, adverse health effects of vaccines. This would, after all, be both immoral and illegal, especially when human lives, and particularly the lives of our most vulnerable, our children, are on the line. In other words, by publishing empirical research that shows vaccines are not safe and effective a priori, many thwart the party line, as represented by the policies and official statements of the CDC, the FDA, and the ACIP, and many online skeptic bloggers (anti-anti-vaccine groups, if you will; most whom fail to grasp the foolishness of such a dialectic, since they rarely take a critical look in the mirror) who claim those refusing vaccines, or educating about their harms, are guilty of crimes, or have blood on their hands.

For example, a concerning study published in 2011 in the International Journal of Medicinerevealed a fact rarely addressed by conventional health authorities, or the mostly uncritical mainstream media, namely: flu vaccines result in inflammatory cardiovascular changes indicative of increased risk for serious heart-related events such as heart attack.[ii]

Titled, “Inflammation-related effects of adjuvant influenza A vaccination on platelet activation and cardiac autonomic function,” their study concluded:

The four main areas of concern mentioned above are:
• Platelet Activation: An indicator of increased risk for pathological clotting and/or obstruction of a blood vessel, e.g. heart attack, embolism or stroke.
• Sympathovagal imbalance towards adrenergic predominance: An indication of disturbed autonomic regulation within the heart.
• Elevation of C-Reactive Protein: An indicator of inflammation-mediated cardiovascular disease risk.

This study is not, however, the first to raise concern over states of pathological inflammation caused by flu vaccines, and vaccines in general. In 2011, the journal Vaccine published a study titled, “Inflammatory responses to trivalent influenza virus vaccine among pregnant women,” which found that flu vaccination causes measurable increases in inflammation in pregnant women which may increase the risk of preeclempsia and other adverse outcomes such as preterm birth.[iii] In this study both CRP and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels increased to concerning levels between one to two days after vaccination. Should we be surprised, considering flu vaccines still contain highly inflammatory, neurotoxic and immunotoxic heavy metals, such as mercury-based thimerosal? Even when the precautionary principle is employed, and mercury-based adjuvants removed in tacit recognition of its profound dangers, aluminum hydroxide is then used to replace it, injected directly into the bodies of healthy infants in the name of synthetically modifying and “improving” their immunity (see: Can We Continue To Justify Injecting Aluminum Into Children?).

And so, despite the fact that vaccine-induced disruption and dysregulation of a pregnant woman’s immune system could compromise her pregnancy, resulting in birth defects[iv] and miscarriage (which is a well-known phenomena within the veterinary field: vaccine-induced abortion), the CDC has defied both common sense and the precautionary principle by urging pregnant women to receive flu vaccines, without informing them of their true risks.

Infants At Risk of Pathological Inflammation Following Vaccines

Just as disturbing is the CDC’s recommendation that all infants, six months or older, receive flu vaccines on top of an already burgeoning vaccination schedule, which begins at the day of birth with the STD vaccine containing hepatitis B surface antigen, despite clear evidence that infants experience cardiorespiratory complications and C-reactive protein responses as a result of all vaccines, administered either singularly or simultaneously in combination. One 2007 study published in the Journal of Pediatrics, found that 85% of newborn infants experienced abnormal elevations of CRP when administered multiple vaccines and up to 70% in those given a single vaccine. Also, overall, 16% of infants were reported to experience vaccine-associated cardiorespiratory events within 48 hours postimmunization. [v]

Suffice it to say, vaccinating against the flu (or any pathogen) is not as safe and effective as we are being told. But please do not adopt my opinion on the matter as your own. Do your own research, and feel free to review some of the underreported and/or otherwise suppressed research on vaccination we have collated at our Vaccine Research and Education page.

970,"It’s easy to confuse viruses and bacteria. They are both extremely tiny, for one thing, and, depending on what kind of bug you get, they can make you sick.

OK, “extremely tiny” and “make you sick”? We do have technical words for these things. Viruses and bacteria are microscopic, meaning they are too small to see with the unaided eye. And pathogens are “disease-producing agents,” especially viruses and certain kinds of bacteria.

But, there are many differences between viruses and bacteria too—and they’re not just important to know to ace your science exams. These differences can be vital to your health and safety.

A virus is an ultramicroscopic (20 to 300 nm in diameter), metabolically inert, infectious agent that replicates only within the cells of living hosts, mainly bacteria, plants, and animals: composed of an RNA or DNA core, a protein coat, and, in more complex types, a surrounding envelope.

Virus, explained in everyday words, is an extremely tiny particle that causes an infectious disease. It is generally made up of some RNA or DNA coated in protein. It can only multiply in the cell of hosts that are alive. That means, technically, viruses are not themselves living.

In informal contexts, virus is also commonly used to refer to the disease caused by the virus. And of course, virus has another special meaning when it comes to computers.

Where does the word virus come from?

The word virus entered English around 1590–1600. It comes directly from the Latin vīrus, meaning “slime, poison.”

The adjective virulent is also ultimately derived from the Latin vīrus. In medical and scientific settings, virulent specifically means “highly infective” or “causing clinical symptoms.” More generally, virulent can mean “actively poisonous,” “violently hostile,” or “intensely bitter.”

What does bacteria mean?

Bacteria are ubiquitous one-celled organisms, spherical, spiral, or rod-shaped and appearing singly or in chains, comprising the Schizomycota, a phylum of the kingdom Monera (in some classification systems the plant class Schizomycetes), various species of which are involved in fermentation, putrefaction, infectious diseases, or nitrogen fixation.

One-celled organisms that sometimes cause infectious diseases but, very often, are essential to keeping us healthy or are harmless. They come in three shapes, resembling a sphere, spiral, or rod.

We generally refer to bacteria just like that: bacteria. But note that bacteria is technically the plural form of the singular bacterium. (You can blame that on Latin.) You might need to use bacterium when discussing the specific kind of bacteria that causes a disease, such as Yersinia pestis, which causes the plague.

Where does the word bacteria come from?

Bacteria is first recorded in English around 1905–10. Bacterium is older, evidenced by 1840–50. Both words ultimately come, via Latin, from the Greek baktēría, meaning “staff.”

Remember how we mentioned that bacteria come in three shapes? The Greek baktēría is related to the Latin word bacillus, a name for rod-shaped bacteria. Sphere-shaped bacteria are also referred to as coccus (cocci in the plural; again, thanks Latin). You may have encountered coccus in streptococcus, which can cause strep throat.

What are some other differences between a virus and bacteria?

As we noted in the intro, a pathogen is an agent that can cause a disease, especially a virus or bacterium. Some fungi and algae can be pathogenic, too.

Viruses cause infection, and those infections very often result in disease. Bacteria can sometimes cause infectious disease, too, but a great deal of bacteria are completely harmless or even beneficial. (Think of all those good bacteria you’re supposed to get from yogurt.)

Because viruses aren’t technically alive, they also aren’t technically microorganisms. A microorganism is “any organism too small to be viewed by the unaided eye, as bacteria, protozoa, and some fungi and algae.”

Another word for a microorganism is a microbe. However, microbe is often used specifically to refer to pathogenic (disease-causing) bacteria. And because viruses are microscopic and infectious, they are also sometimes referred to as microbes. An everyday term for microbes is germs.

Yeah, we know it’s confusing. Language—just as life—can get messy.

Another area of difference between viruses and bacteria concerns what treats them.

Both vaccines and antibiotics are used to treat infectious diseases. There are vaccines that work against both viruses and bacterias. Antibiotics, however, only work against bacteria and other microorganisms.

What does vaccine mean?

A vaccine is any preparation used as a preventive inoculation to confer immunity against a specific disease, usually employing an innocuous form of the disease agent, such as killed or weakened bacteria or viruses, to stimulate antibody production.

What does antibiotic mean?

An antibiotic is any of a large group of chemical substances, as penicillin or streptomycin, produced by various microorganisms and fungi, having the capacity in dilute solutions to inhibit the growth of or to destroy bacteria and other microorganisms, used chiefly in the treatment of infectious diseases.

What are different types of viruses?

COVID-19 is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Coronavirus is a family of viruses that includes SARS and MERS.

The flu is also caused by viruses, but the novel coronavirus is not the flu. There are many types of flus. Different strains of what’s known as the H1N1 virus have caused some particularly lethal pandemics, including the 2009 swine flu and 1918 pandemic flu, commonly referred to as the Spanish flu.

There are many types of other viruses that you have probably heard of, notably hantavirus and HIV. Some diseases caused by viruses include chickenpox, Ebola, polio, and smallpox. Seasonal flus and, yes, the common cold are viral infections, too.

What does flu mean?

The word flu is short for influenza—borrowed from Italian and from the same Latin root that gives English the word influence. Formally defined, influenza is an acute, commonly epidemic disease, occurring in several forms. It is caused by numerous rapidly mutating viral strains and characterized by respiratory symptoms and general prostration.

General prostration? That’s another way of saying “I just can’t get out of bed.” And on that note, stay safe, stay at home when you can, and wash your hands. That will help you, and others, avoid general prostration—or worse.",mainstream,M0ac04,coronavirus; covid.19; vaccine

54,"The number of rubella infections is rising in India. Rubella infection is transmitted from a pregnant woman to foetus, thus resulting in babies born with various diseases. It is a contagious, but generally mild viral infection which usually occurs in children and young adults. Congenital rubella syndrome is a condition which can cause deafness, heart defects, mental retardation and cataract in newborn babies. A surveillance was conducted by the health ministry on 150 babies for screening rubella syndrome. 50 of these babies were screened with congenital rubella syndrome and birth defects. The foetus gets infected within the first 3 months of pregnancy.

Congenital rubella syndrome is one of the leading causes of birth defects, but is vaccine preventable. Pregnant women infected with rubella infection are at risk of foetal death or congenital defects - which is known as congenital rubella syndrome. Rubella is spread in airborne droplets when the ones who are infected by it sneeze or cough. Once a person is infected by rubella, the virus spreads throughout the body in around five to seven days.

Also read: Are Rising Temperatures Responsible For Increased Childhood Viral Infections?

There is no specific treatment for rubella, the disease is preventable by vaccination.

Symptoms of rubella infection include mild fever, rashes and illness in children. Pregnant women infected by rubella vaccine are at risks of miscarriage, foetal death and stillbirth. Infants are at risk of congenital birth defects - known as congenital rubella syndrome.

These children are also likely to suffer from hearing impairments and defects in eye and heart. They are likely to suffer from lifelong disabilities like diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction and autism.

Most serious consequences of rubella infections can be acquired during the first trimester during pregnancy. Women can get their measles rubella vaccine even during their menstrual cycle. People at high risk of rubella infections are non-immunised young adults. Before the vaccine was available until 1969, rubella epidemics happened every 6 to 9 years in kids from 5 to 9 years of age. Cases of congenital rubella syndrome were also widespread.

The discussion led to an agreement on two main goals. The first was to accelerate innovative research to help contain the spread of the epidemic and facilitate care for those affected. The second was to support research priorities that contribute to global research platforms in hopes of learning from the current pandemic response to better prepare for the next unforeseen epidemic.

Standing in solidarity with those least able to protect themselves from the COVID-19 pandemic is not only the right thing to do, but the only way the world will overcome this, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres told the Economic and Social Council, which launched a global call to action at its 2020 Humanitarian Affairs Segment, convened from 9 to 11 June via videoconference due to coronavirus-related restrictions.

The 54-member Economic and Social Council launched the Call to Action in support of the humanitarian response in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, including a set of 13 concrete actions encompassing flexible funding, fast-tracking health and aid personnel at borders and special measures to serve vulnerable populations. The actions aimed to save lives and prevent the spread of COVID-19, given that during the span of the three-day meeting, the number of confirmed cases rose to 7.1 million from 6.9 million, and the death toll reached 408,000 since the outbreak was reported.

The Call to Action stated: “As the world faces the unprecedented challenge of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, we must commit to act with urgency and determination to respond to this crisis. We must recommit to doing so through international solidarity, cooperation, unity and humanity.”

The Council called for urgent, determined measures to meet humanitarian needs and prevent and mitigate further devastating humanitarian impacts on those disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, including women and children, older persons, persons with disabilities, refugees, internally displaced persons and migrants.

Provisions of the Call to Action also urged Member States and other potential donors to support scaling up emergency efforts to contain the pandemic and consider urgently funding the Global Humanitarian Response Plan to meet its requirements, without diverting funds from other areas of need. Other provisions called upon Member States to work closely with the United Nations and to facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance, including fast-tracking the passage of health and humanitarian personnel at borders and in-country, ensuring their health, safety and well-being, and designating them as essential workers.

The action plan further called on Member States and other relevant stakeholders to take steps to prevent speculation and undue stockpiling that may hinder access to safe, effective and affordable essential medicines, vaccines, personal protective equipment and medical equipment, as well as to provide access to and fair distribution of all essential health technologies and products, including their requisite components and precursors, as a global priority, and to urgently remove unjustified obstacles. All stakeholders were asked to heed the Secretary-General’s calls to address COVID-19, including for an immediate global ceasefire so as to lessen the devastating humanitarian effects of armed conflicts and to enable more emphasis on responding to the pandemic.

The 2020 Humanitarian Affairs Segment focused on the theme “Reinforcing humanitarian assistance in the context of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations: taking action for people-centred solutions, strengthening effectiveness, respecting international humanitarian law and promoting the humanitarian principles”.

Since 1998, the Humanitarian Affairs Segment has been a platform for discussing issues related to strengthening the coordination and effectiveness of the United Nations humanitarian assistance, including assessing progress and identifying emerging issues, obstacles and challenges. It also promotes the sharing of experiences and lessons learned at national and regional levels.

During the 2020 Humanitarian Affairs Segment, Economic and Social Council members participated in a high-level event on combating and preventing sexual and gender-based violence in humanitarian crises and three interactive high-level panels, focusing on health, technology and assisting internally displaced persons. Prior to the opening session, the Chairs of the Operational Activity for Development Segment and the Humanitarian Affairs Segment jointly convened a virtual high-level panel event on 8 June on the theme “Transition from Relief to Development: The multidimensional and interconnected challenges in the Central Sahel region: reducing needs, risks and vulnerabilities for people through closer humanitarian, development and peacebuilding collaboration.”

Side events were also held virtually on the following themes: saving lives, building trust, and informing humanitarian action: how good practice and lessons learned from community engagement can help beat COVID-19; strengthening the protection of children during COVID-19: launching the Child Protection Minimum Standards; anticipatory approach to COVID-19 and other crises; and counter-terrorism and humanitarian action in the age of COVID-19. The following side-events were held on 12 June: mental health and psychosocial support for displaced and migrant populations during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond; humanitarian consequences arising from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas; and towards more inclusive and disaggregated data on displacement.

Secretary-General António Guterres, delivering the keynote address in a video message, said that even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the world faced unprecedented levels of humanitarian suffering. Now, at a time when the coronavirus threatens to increase hunger and poverty and risk the reversal of decades of development gains, he urged Member States and other donors to swiftly fund the COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan and sustain funding to existing humanitarian operations.

“We must act now to save lives and prevent future suffering,” he said. “When human rights are at the centre, we deliver better outcomes.” Emphasizing that respect for international law must form the foundation of the response, he said the wider drivers of suffering around the world must also be examined, including persistent inequalities, climate change and prolonged conflict. He also wished participants a constructive segment.

Chaired by Economic and Social Council Vice-President Omar Hilale (Morocco), the opening session featured: Mark Lowcock, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator; Henrietta Fore, Executive Director of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF); Qu Dongyu, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); and Abby Maxman, Chief Executive Officer of Oxfam. Peter Maurer, President of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), sent a video message.

Mr. Lowcock said: “this pandemic is unlike anything we have dealt with in our lifetime; extraordinary measures are needed. Our response must be proportionate to the scale of the problem we face.” Emphasizing that discussions over the coming days present an opportunity to harden the resolve to fight the virus and find solutions, he declared that “the stakes have never been higher; we will either win this battle together, or not at all.”

Laying out the landscape, he said that as of 8 June, there are 6.9 million confirmed cases worldwide, approximately 1 in every 1,100 people. Over the past month, rapid increases have been reported in Africa, from roughly 55,000 cases on 8 May to more than 190,000 a month later, and in Latin America and the Caribbean, which is now considered the epicenter of the pandemic, with 1.3 million cases. The disease is set to peak in the most fragile places on Earth in the next three to six months and could potentially be catastrophic in the developing world.

The pandemic’s secondary effects are equally worrisome, he said, as they pose a deeper and longer-lasting threat to some developing countries than the virus itself. Indeed, the biggest economic slowdown in living memory has led to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) estimating that the main measures of human development are set to decline in 2020 for the first time since 1990. The World Bank forecasts that the pandemic could push as many as 60 million people into extreme poverty while the World Food Programme (WFP) predicts it could move 130 million people towards the brink of starvation, almost double the 2019 figure. COVID-19 is also compounding pre-pandemic humanitarian threats, including the world’s unprecedented 60 million displaced persons, countries facing negative climate change consequences, sharply rising food insecurity, disease outbreaks and the worst infestation of locusts in generations.

Meanwhile, he said, innovative steps are being taken to address the erosion of humanitarian access crippled by cancelled flights in some places, border closures, quarantine measures, lockdowns, curfews and disrupted supply routes that have made it almost impossible to get help to people in need. They include air bridges for humanitarian aid and personnel to get to vulnerable populations and technology tools to trace and track infection and fight the spread of disinformation.

Still, an estimated $90 billion is needed to provide humanitarian assistance to those in the world’s poorest countries, he said. At the same time, the COVID‑19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan is the international community’s primary fundraising vehicle to respond to the impact of the virus in low- and middle-income countries and support their efforts to fight it. While $6.7 billion would cover the period until December, only $1.2 billion, or 17.4 per cent, is funded to date, he said, warning that diverting resources from humanitarian operations to fund the COVID-19 response would be counter-productive and lead to more and faster loss of life. As such, he called on donors to continue providing flexible funding that allows for quick, agile decision-making wherever possible.

Ms. Fore, outlining UNICEF efforts and obstacles, said the pandemic marks an opportunity for the entire humanitarian community to “do things differently” to more effectively reach those most in need, including the world’s children. In just a few short months, the pandemic and efforts to contain it have laid bare existing inequities, vulnerabilities and weaknesses of national systems around the world, the result of decades of under-investment in what is needed to support children’s futures. While the landscape has changed, children’s needs have not, including vaccinations, schools, water, sanitation, hygiene, nutrition, release from detention and protection both from violence and now the spread of COVID-19.

Highlighting interwoven challenges preventing the humanitarian community from serving the world’s most vulnerable children, she cautioned that there is a new Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 60 countries have put vaccination campaigns on hold while focusing on defeating COVID-19 and new outbreaks of measles and cholera are likely to worsen as a consequence of coronavirus responses. In addition, staff and partners face violence and harassment due to stigma and people fearful of becoming infected, convoys and missions are subjected to delays and searches, and vehicles are being expropriated. She also pointed at reports of violence against mostly female health-care workers responding to COVID-19 across countries. In some cases, security forces are violently enforcing lockdowns, which could lead to potential under-reporting and “hidden caseloads” of the coronavirus.

She said improving responses now depends on strengthening health systems, reinforcing local groups and increasing collaboration with donors to change the conditionalities that often limit the ability to provide assistance that is impartial, rather than political. The humanitarian community must unite in finding new ways to share the risks of this important work. “Let us use this moment as a time to define a new contract among the global humanitarian community, as we seek to better serve and support the world’s most vulnerable communities,” she said.

Other speakers described factors affecting the present and future humanitarian landscape. Reflecting on how the humanitarian system is responding and adapting quickly and collaborating with a range of partners, and what more can be done, they also examined the value of collective humanitarian action to multilateralism and to global solidarity for affected people and communities.

Following the opening session on 9 June, a high-level panel was convened on the theme “Addressing the increasing complexity of health challenges in humanitarian contexts”. It focused on the critical next steps needed to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and to respond to increasing needs driven by it, recognizing trends in recent years of disease outbreaks and epidemics.

Chaired by Mr. Hilale and moderated by Mr. Lowcock, it featured the following panellists: Sigrid Kaag, Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation of the Netherlands; Ibrahima Socé Fall, Assistant Director-General for Emergency Response at the World Health Organization (WHO); Amir Abdulla, Deputy Executive Director of the WFP; Jagan Chapagain, Secretary General of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC); Christos Christou, International President of Médecins Sans Frontiers; Raji Tajudeen, Head, Division of Public Health Institutes and Research, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention; and Atim Caroline Ogwang, Director of the South Sudan Women with Disability Network.

Mr. Lowcock said humanitarian agencies are doing all they can to maintain and adapt ongoing operations in the face of the unprecedented challenges brought on by COVID-19. Along with Governments, they are using creativity to ensure that they can deliver ongoing services and launch new ones wherever feasible. WHO and other humanitarian health response organizations are scaling up preparedness, planning and response to the pandemic in dozens of countries while adapting their pre-COVID-19 responses to this new reality, working with hundreds of health partners and community workers.

Highlighting several examples, he said that partners in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Djibouti and Sudan are providing larger food rations, requiring less frequent deliveries, and pre-positioning supplies closer to camps. In Niger, they are collaborating to provide assistance on all fronts at once — health, food, nutrition and protection — to reduce infection risks; and in Ukraine, aid is provided door-to-door where possible. All over the world, aid agencies are increasing their use of cash over in-kind assistance to limit human contact. Citing the Secretary-General’s message, he said: “We are in this fight together, so now it is our job as humanitarian agencies to ensure that no one is left behind.”

Panellists discussed how the United Nations and its partners are mobilizing responses and working with local organizations to adapt to current and future challenges while identifying emerging needs, addressing access issues and implementing preparedness measures to mitigate further risks. They also explained how to anchor these new humanitarian principle approaches in a context where related needs are driven by an increasingly complex mix of health, economic and development crises, and by protracted conflicts.

Further, they highlighted measures required to lower the human costs of these new dynamics and described ways they are meeting urgent existing needs, even as the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to drive already historic levels of hunger to new extremes and add hundreds of millions to the ranks of poverty. Speakers also offered solutions for facilitating the flow of humanitarian and medical supplies to where they are most needed. Finally, they discussed the pandemic’s mental health and psychosocial impact, along with solutions for affected people, and for front-line humanitarian workers.

In the afternoon a high-level event was held on the theme “Combating and preventing sexual and gender-based violence in humanitarian crises”. The event brought together key stakeholders, including Member States, humanitarians, civil society and survivors, to engage in dialogue about key issues and experiences, and share best practices to address sexual and gender-based violence.

Chaired by Mr. Hilale and moderated by Mr. Lowcock, it featured the following panellists: Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Norway; acclaimed author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; Natalia Kanem, Executive Director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA); Henrietta Fore, Executive Director of UNICEF; Kelly Clements, Deputy United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; Elinor Raikes, Vice-President and Head of Programme Delivery at the International Rescue Committee; Christine Seisun, Sexual Violence Operations Manager at the ICRC, South Sudan; and Fátima Shehu Imam, Director of the Network of Civil Society Organizations in Borno State.

Mr. Lowcock said COVID-19 has multiplied threats to human rights and dignity while also threatening to reverse gains towards gender equality and women’s rights. Many women and girls have faced gender-based violence, including sexual violence, and sexual exploitation and abuse, and in many places, calls to hotlines have increased by 30 to 40 per cent following quarantine and lockdown measures.

“It has forced us to take a hard, and I hope, honest look, at inequalities and how we protect our most vulnerable,” he said. “This is also a moment of opportunity to act fast and in unity, while there is global momentum to recover better from the pandemic.” Everyone must pull together, he said, to put girls and women at the centre of efforts through a whole-of-system approach working with local communities, civil society, Governments, regional organizations, donors, and humanitarian and development organizations.

Actions to address these concerns must be prioritized now, he said, stressing that one in three women will experience some form of physical or sexual violence in her lifetime, and the likelihood of that happening is worse for women with disabilities. Leadership, including by involving women in humanitarian decision-making, and addressing gender inequality, are some of the ways forward. For its part, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is working to mitigate, respond to and prevent gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. It is also prioritizing gender equality and addressing gender-based violence in response to the pandemic through the COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan, he said, adding that: “We are doing this because responding to gender-based violence reduces suffering and saves lives.”

Panellists drew attention to the current situation, assessing the disproportionate impact on women and girls in humanitarian crises. They also discussed trends exposed in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, what is being done and what more needs to urgently be done to prevent and respond to ongoing concerns in humanitarian contexts.

On 10 June, a high-level panel addressed the theme “improving humanitarian effectiveness through new technology and innovation: opportunities and challenges”. Chaired by Mr. Hilale and moderated by Ramesh Rajasingham, Acting Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, it featured the following panellists: Fabrizio Hochschild, Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Commemoration of the United Nations Seventy-Fifth Anniversary; Valerie Guarnieri, Assistant Executive Director of WFP; Balthasar Staehelin, Director of Digital Transformation and Data at the ICRC; Adelina Kamal, Executive Director of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management; Patrick Meier, Chief Executive Officer of WeRobotics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy; Raj Kumar, Founding President and Editor-in-Chief of Devex; and Sunita Grote, Innovation Fund Manager at UNICEF.

Mr. Rajasingham recalled that “flatten the curve” is among the terms recently penetrating public discourse in most countries, many languages and all age groups. This commonly used shorthand covers a long and complex process of data collection and verification, analysis, computer modelling, forecasting and data visualization to get to the “curve”. It also demonstrates that data-driven decision-making language in most countries is now driving public conversations about how the world should respond to the pandemic.

Modelling and forecasting in various forms are not new to humanitarian planning and preparedness, he said, pointing to such tools as artificial intelligence, machine learning and predictive analytics that are used to more quickly and efficiently analyze and make decisions about how to respond to crises. In 2019, the WFP quickened its emergency response to cyclones in Mozambique by relying on artificial intelligence and machine learning for disaster mapping. Data compiled in large and complex humanitarian and development databases form the building blocks of this new technology and innovation, he said, adding that many public, private and academic partnerships across the international community use analytics to forecast, prevent and mitigate the spread of disease, hunger, flood damage and other hazards.

Citing other ongoing initiatives, he pointed at biometrics to provide digital identities for people needing aid, blockchain technology to send digital cash, drones to assess disasters and deliver aid, 3D printing to dramatically shorten delivery time and costs, and chatbots to communicate with affected communities. Through the Centre for Humanitarian Data in The Hague, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is exploring predictive analytics that can drive anticipatory action to get ahead of a crisis and avert the worst consequences.

However, these promising innovations have great potential while posing new challenges and risks, he said, among them privacy, data protection and spreading false information. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a new risk is now labelled the “infodemic”: the spread of misinformation and disinformation, and the use of technology to stigmatize people or incite tensions. To overcome such risks and challenges, he said the “do no harm” concept must apply, as should respect for other international principles and norms guiding humanitarian work.

Panellists addressed concrete ways the humanitarian sector is improving effectiveness in a changing landscape by using new technology and innovation. Some showcased innovations being used to improve the impact of humanitarian operations while sharing best practices and lessons learned. They discussed how the humanitarian sector is positioning itself to work with partners, including regional, national, and local actors and the private sector, to identify and roll-out further opportunities. They also identified the risks and challenges associated with new and emerging technologies and how these can be mitigated.

On 11 June, a high-level panel was held on the theme “Mobilizing action to improve humanitarian assistance for internally displaced persons and achieve durable solutions”. Chaired by Mr. Hilale and moderated by Mr. Lowcock, it featured the following panellists: Federica Mogherini, Co-Chair of the United Nations Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel on Internal Displacement; Michelle Bachelet, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; António Vitorino, Director General of the International Organization for Migration (IOM); Asha Mohammed, Secretary General of the Kenya Red Cross Society; Nasir Ahmad Andisha, Co-Chair of the Group of Friends on Internal Displacement and Permanent Representative of Afghanistan to the United Nations Office in Geneva; and Veronica Ngum Ndi, Gender Officer in the Coordinating Unit of the Associations of Persons with Disabilities.

Panellists shared experiences involving the diverse needs of internally displaced persons and new approaches towards achieving durable solutions. Speakers explained how long-term solutions can be advanced from the very outset of a humanitarian emergency. They also explored concrete ways the international community can better support internally displaced persons, host communities and Governments.

On 11 June, at the closing session, Mr. Rajasingham said that the two leading messages emerging from discussions are that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing humanitarian challenges while also exposing and amplifying existing inequalities.

“The most important takeaway of this Humanitarian Affairs Segment is that challenges will remain with us, but we need to rise to the occasion, working with Member States, affected people and all of our partners to save lives and prevent suffering,” he said. “We now need to act urgently and differently. This moment is an opportunity to do things better, together.”

Mr. Hilale, thanking participants for a constructive session, summarized discussions held and presented a range of recommendations, such as investing in community engagement, which is essential and will lead to a more effective humanitarian response. The pandemic has also demonstrated that anticipation and preparation can save lives and reduce suffering and costs. One critical anticipatory step the entire international community can take right now is to commit to what the United Nations and the IFRC have described as a “people’s vaccine” to COVID-19 to ensure that no one is left behind from the vaccine. A “business as usual” approach will not be effective, nor should it be acceptable, he said.

Other recommendations included investing in mental health and psychosocial support; prioritizing women’s experiences, protection, capacities and leadership; and better harnessing the transformative potential of new technology and innovation. Inclusiveness is key across the board in humanitarian action, he said, underlining the importance of focusing on vulnerable groups, including internally displaced persons. In addition, such ongoing threats as terrorism and the adverse impact of climate change must be addressed.

Launching the global Call to Action, he declared that: “Ultimately, no one can be safe from COVID-19 until we are all safe from COVID-19. The Call to Action in support of humanitarian response in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic addresses our determination and the urgency to act now.”

Mr. Hilale also said the resolution traditionally adopted at each Humanitarian Affairs Segment will be adopted at the Council’s first formal meeting, following the lifting of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.",mainstream,M09851,vaccine.covid
503,"An alarming video published in February by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has revealed some startling information about vaccine testing and approval procedures. Even the biggest supporter of vaccines will NOT believe their eyes! (the video – below – says it all.)

Simply put, (and the evidence is undeniable) vaccines and related pharmaceuticals are literally rushed to the market without proper testing and verification. We, at NaturalHealth365, have been talking about this for years – but, now, we have (video) proof.

In reality, “test results” are derived from consumers. Safety data on these drugs literally are not available until people start taking the vaccine.

During this horrifying revelation captured on video (below), it is even admitted that we and our children are supposed to be the ‘guinea pigs’ for these vaccines in lieu of clinical testing.

Here is the full video released by the CDC from the 2018 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) conference. The most relevant portion begins at the 47:23 mark and continues until one hour 7 seconds:

A more condensed and concise Facebook version is available at this link:

Some vaccine ingredients include the adjuvants aluminum, chromium and mercury, which are known neurotoxins. They are bad enough for adults, but when administered to children, exposure to these substances far exceeds CDC recommended safe levels. (Should any amount of metal in a food or drug be considered safe?!)

Here’s another valid point to consider: despite vaccine use, the incidents of many diseases and health conditions are actually higher. Rates of cervical cancer, infectious diseases and autism are still way to high – especially when you consider the fact that vaccines are supposed to reduce our risk.

In addition to vaccine side effects such as neurological problems and autism, vaccines have also been linked to many autoimmune disorders. One has to wonder why autoimmune diseases are on the rise.

The National Institutes of Health reports that up to 23.5 million Americans have an autoimmune condition.

We MUST admit the obvious: Leadership – within the medical community – IS aware of unsafe vaccines

For example, a pair of Italian scientists have verified unsafe levels of contaminants in vaccines in a 2017 study.

Using electron-microscopy, they examined 30 human and veterinary vaccines, including for hepatitis, influenza, cervical cancer, meningitis and allergies. ALL BUT ONE of the tested samples tested positive for inorganic contaminants.

Both single types of contaminants and disturbing assemblages of toxic substances were found in the vaccines. The researchers admitted to being “baffled” by the bizarre compositions of some of these contaminant combinations.

Lead particles were found in cervical cancer vaccines Cervarix and Gardasil, as well as in the meningitis vaccine Meningetec and the seasonal flu vaccine Aggripal. In addition to heavy metals, red cells from either humans or animals were found in some of the drugs. (how can doctors think this is ‘safe!’)

WARNING: Incidents of autoimmune disease and other conditions higher despite vaccine use

The researchers believe these contaminants are causing the immune system to react, releasing microphages to fight the foreign bodies. This leads to systemic inflammation and the other characteristics of autoimmune disease.

In a pattern that is all too familiar, not long after the husband and wife team released their findings, their home was raided by Italian police and their data seized.

It’s time to speak up and demand that vaccines be thoroughly tested before release to the public. Parents should continue to fight for the right to opt out of vaccine programs unless and until they are properly tested and verified as safe.",conspiracy,C01114,vaccine
529,"Part 5: The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Masks Its Own Ineptitude by Attacking ‘Conspiracy Theorists’ and ‘Vigilantes’

Spiro Skouras, former executive producer at Newsbud, has emerged as one of the more engaging and erudite of the young investigative journalists who have been delving into the Wuhan Coronavirus epidemic. Skouras has documented the position of many prominent figures that have questioned the dubious claim that the source of COVID-19 infection was a diseased animal in Wuhan’s open-air food market.

Skouras has argued it would be “negligent” for researchers to refrain from investigating “the full array of possibilities” on how the contagion originated and how it spread.

Among the first figures, Skouras interviewed on the crisis was Francis Boyle, the renowned professor of international law at the University of Illinois. Prof. Boyle drafted the Biological Weapons and Terrorism Act, legislation that enabled US ratification of the UN’s Biological Warfare Convention in 1990.

Prof. Boyle indicated in his interview with Skouras that COVID-19 is most likely a genetically-engineered pathogen that escaped from the so-called Biosafety Laboratory in Wuhan. Prof. Boyle indicated,

Prof. Boyle points to the fact that the SARS virus leaked out from a Beijing lab in 2004. He describes as “propaganda” the widely promulgated opinion that COVID-19 originated in Wuhan’s exotic, open-air food market. Prof. Boyle expanded some of his interpretations in a subsequent interview published by GreatGameIndia.

Skouras specifically asked Dr. Boyle about his relationship with mainstream media given his record as one of the foremost academic experts on international law and military culture concerning the development of bioweaponry in the United States. Dr. Boyle responded that he was pretty much blacklisted from commenting on the subject of biological warfare ever since he publicly shared his interpretation of the anthrax attacks on two US Senators in October of 2001.

There has been considerable scholarly scrutiny of the anthrax attacks targeting the US Congress and some media organizations in early October of 2001. The anthrax attacks constitute the most serious assault ever on the operations of the US Congress, the primary interface between law and politics in the United States.

These attacks have come to be understood as an integral part of the large body of crimes committed in Manhattan and Washington DC on 9/11. The anthrax attacks killed five people including two postal workers. Seventeen people were injured and Congress was shut down for a few days.

Anthrax-laden letter attacks were specifically directed at two Democratic Party Senators, Patrick Leahy and Tom Daschle. When they received the contaminated letters both lawmakers were engaged in questioning provisions of the post-9/11 emergency measures legislation known as the Patriot Act. Both Senators Leahy and Daschle were hesitant to rubber stamp the enactment that was seemingly instantly drafted and put before Congress within three weeks of the 9/11 debacle.

The anthrax attacks took place just as the US Armed Forces began invading Afghanistan where the culprits of the 9/11 crimes were supposed to be hiding out. The perpetrators of the anthrax attack, who we were supposed to imagine at the time as al-Qaeda terrorists, succeeded in easing aside the major locus of opposition to the Patriot Act’s speedy passage in late October. Why, one might legitimately ask, ask, would Islamic jihadists want the Patriot Act to be rushed through Congress. In early October the US Armed Forces invaded Afghanistan at the same time that the US executive branch was seeking with the Patriot a license to kill and torture and steal without any checks of accountability.

Once the US Armed Forces went to war with Afghanistan on the basis of a fraudulent explanation of 9/11’s genesis, there was basically no chance that a genuine and legitimate evidence-based investigation of the September 11 crimes would ever take place. To this day the Global War on Terror continues to unfold on a foundation of lies and illusions that have had devastating consequences for the quality of life for average people throughout the United States and the world.

In his 2005 book, Biowarfare and Terrorism, Prof. Boyle’s analysis pointed to major problems in the FBI’s investigation of the anthrax attacks including the agency’s destruction of relevant evidence. To Prof. Boyle, the highly refined military-grade quality of the anthrax made it almost certain that the anthrax bioweapon was produced within the US Armed Forces at the lab in Fort Detrick Maryland. Anthrax, or Bacillus anthracis, is a rod-shaped bacteria found naturally in soil.

Looking back at the episode Dr. Boyle observed, “The Pentagon and the C.I.A. are ready, willing, and able to launch biowarfare when it suits their interests. They already attacked the American People and Congress and disabled our Republic with super-weapons-grade anthrax in October 2001.”

Prof. Boyle’s interpretation was later verified and expanded upon in a book by Canadian Prof. Graeme MacQueen. Prof. Boyle acknowledges the veracity of Prof. MacQueen’s study of the anthrax deception as part of a “domestic conspiracy.” He sees The 2001 Anthrax Deception as the most advanced finding of academic research on the topic so far.

Prof. MacQueen is prominent among a very large group of academics and public officials who condemn the official narrative of 9/11 for its dramatic inconsistencies with the available evidence. Those who share this understanding include former Italian Prime Minister Francesco Cossiga, former German Defence Minister Andreas von Bülow, former UK Minister of the Environment Michael Meacher, former Assistant Secretary of the US Treasury Paul Craig Roberts, former Director of the US Star Wars Missile Defense Program Lt. Col. Bob Bowman, Princeton International Law Professor Richard Falk, and the author of ten academic books on different aspects of the 9/11 debacle, Claremont Graduate University Professor David Ray Griffin.

Prof. Francis Boyle shared the 9/11 skepticism of many when he asked,

In his coverage of the Wuhan Coronavirus epidemic, Spiro Skouras highlighted the proceedings known as Event 201. Event 201 brought together in New York on October 18, 2019 an assembly of delegates hosted by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Economic Forum and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. The gathering anticipated the COVID-19 crisis by just a few weeks. I retrospect it is almost as if Event 201 announced many of the controversies about to arise with the outbreak of the real epidemic in Wuhan China. Event 201 performed functions similar to those of the drills that frequently mimic the engineered scenarios animating false flag terror events but especially those of 9/11.

A major subject of the meeting highlighted the perceived need to control communications during an epidemic. Levan Thiru of the Monetary Authority of Singapore went as far as to call for “a step up on the part of governments to take action against Fake News.” Thiru called for recriminatory litigation aimed at criminalizing “bad actors.” Cautioning against this kind of censorship, Skouras asked, Who is going to decide what constitutes “Fake News”? If fact checkers are to be employed, “who will fact check the fact checkers”?

Hasti Taghi, a media executive with NBC Universal in New York, was especially outspoken in condemning the activities of “conspiracy theorists” that have organized themselves to question the motives and methods of the complex of agencies involved in developing and disseminating vaccines. She frequently condemned the role of “conspiracy theories” in energizing public distrust of the role of pharmaceutical companies and media conglomerates in their interactions with government.

Tom Ingelsby of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security injected an interesting twist into the discussion. He asked, “How much control of information should there be? By whom should control of information be exercised? How can false information be effectively challenged?” Ingelsby then added, “What happens if the false information is coming from companies and governments?”

This final question encapsulates a major problem for conscientious citizens trying to find their way through the corruption and disinformation that often permeates our key institutions. Those that try to counter the problem that governments and corporations sometimes peddle false information can pretty much expect to face accusations that they are “conspiracy theorists.” Too often the calculations involved in deciding whom or what is credible (or not) depends primarily on simple arithmetic favouring the preponderance of wealth and power.

Spiro Skouras gives careful consideration to the possibility that the United States instigated the COVID-19 epidemic starting in Wuhan China.

He notes the precedent set in 1945 on the atomic attacks by the US government on the civilian populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Skouras points out that there is proof that since the Second World War, the US government has conducted at least 239 experiments, secretly deploying toxic chemical and biological agents against portions of its own population.

Skouras highlights the window presented for a covert US bioweapon attack at the World Military Games in Wuhan China in the second half of October of 2019. He notes that 300 US soldiers participated as athletes in the Wuhan Military Games together with a large contingent of American support personnel. The timing and the circumstances of the event were more or less ideal to open up a new pathogenic front in the US government’s informal “hybrid war” against China.

On Feb. 15 at the Munich Security Conference, US Defence Secretary, Mark T. Esper, developed a highly critical characterization of Chinese wrongdoing in order to seemingly justify recriminatory actions. Esper asserted, “China’s growth over the years has been remarkable, but in many ways it is fuelled by theft, coercion, and exploitation of free market economies, private companies, and colleges and universities… Huawei and 5G are today’s poster child for this nefarious activity.

The US antagonism to Huawei’s leadership in the design and worldwide dissemination of 5 G technology might well be a factor in the scandal generated by the Chinese connection to intertwined research in microbiology at the level 4 labs in Winnipeg and Wuhan.

Back in 2000 the notorious report entitled Rebuilding America’s Defenses, a publication brought forward by the neoconservative Project for the New American Century (PNAC), proposed that the US government should refurbish and invoke its capacity to wage biological warfare. PNAC was the think tank that anticipated the events of September 11, 2001 by outlining a strategic scheme that could only be realized by mobilizing American public opinion with “a catalytic event like a New Pearl Harbor.”

After 9/11, the PNAC Team of related neoconservative activists and Zionist organizations pretty much took over the governance of the United States along with the build up and deployment of its formidable war machine. PNAC called for the invocation of “advanced forms of biological warfare that can ‘target’ specific genotypes.” In this fashion “biological warfare might be transformed into a politically useful tool.”

The relationship of this pandemic to internal disagreements within China has been put on full display in Steve Bannon’s coverage of the crisis entitled War Room: Pandemic. A prominent member of US President Donald Trump’s inner circle, Steve Bannon is often accompanied on the daily show by Chinese billionaire dissident, Miles Guo (aka Guo Wengui, Miles Haoyun, Miles Kwok).

Guo is an outspoken Chinese refugee. He is a persistent critic of virtually every facet of the policies and actions of the Chinese Communist Party.

Guo regularly condemns those who dominate China’s one-party system, a system run by an elite who, he alleges, are corrupt, incompetent and inveterate liars. Guo regularly asserts that all of the Chinese government’s numbers on the pandemic, including death rates and infection rates, can probably be multiplied by 10X or even 100X to get closer to accuracy.

[On the 10X guestimate of mortality and infection see this.]

Clearly Bannon and Guo would like to see the emergency conditions created by the pandemic as a wedge of division, protest and regime change within China. One of the subjects they regularly raise, as do others who accuse the Chinese government of systematic lying and deception, is that the crematoriums in Wuhan and nearby Chongqing are burning corpses of dead people at a rate far higher than official death figures. Some reports indicated that portable incinerators were being brought into the most infected core of the Wuhan Coronavirus epidemic.

It is troubling, to say the least, that some reports indicate dead people are being cremated far faster and at far higher rates than the Chinese government and the World Health Organization are reporting. Some reckoning with the apparent disparity between reported and actual deaths has led to widespread suspicions about what is actually going in the scenes of violent and angry exchanges between people in the Wuhan area.

Many of these videos show brutal confrontations between Chinese civilians and Chinese security police. The displays of desperation by some of those trying to escape apprehensions by uniformed officials seem sometimes to suggest the severity of a life or death struggle. It is made to seem that those seeking to escape the grip of authorities are aware that their failure to do so might lead to a quick death and a quick exit by incineration. These reflections are, of course, speculative rather than definitive.

Questions concerning who we are supposed to believe or not in this crisis are becoming ever more pressing and volatile. One of the emerging themes in the discourse developed at War Room: Pandemic is the propensity of some of the core agencies of mainstream media in the United States to accept at face value the reports they receive from official media outlets answering to the Chinese Communist Party. To Banning and Guo this pattern makes media organizations like the New York Times, The Washington Post, and CNN essentially propaganda extensions of the Chinese government.

The Chinese people themselves are clearly grappling in new ways with the problem of how to understand the information and directives given them by the governing apparatus of the Chinese Communist Party. Clearly the Party initially failed the people by not intervening early and decisively enough after the first cases of Coronavirus illness began to show up. The exit from Wuhan of almost five million people in prior to the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations had huge implications for spreading the contagion.

As noted in the introduction, the death in Wuhan of Dr. Li Wenliang on 7 February has become a flash point for popular criticism of the Chinese Communist Party led by General Secretary Xi Jinping. Dr. Li wrote to members of his medical school alumnus group suggesting that some significant action should be taken in response to the appearance of SARS-like symptoms that suddenly afflicted his patients.

For sending out this unauthorized communication, Dr. Li was summoned along with seven other supposed offenders to the Public Security Bureau. There he was warned by police to stop “making false statements.” He was ordered to cease and desist “spreading rumors,” and “acting illegally to disturb social order.”

Dr. Li signed a form indicating he would refrain from continuing to do what he had been accused of doing. The chastised professional returned to his medical practice. He took his own advice and began treating patients exhibiting signs of the new illness. He himself soon died from COVID-19 when it was still known as 19-nCoV.

Is Twitter’s permanent deplatforming of the Zero Hedge web site a North American version of the police intervention in China with the goal of silencing Dr. Li? Is the censorship of the Internet in the name of opposing “conspiracy theorists” repeating the Chinese Communist Party’s effort to silence Dr. Li?

Is Dr. Li to be appropriately understood as a Chinese version of a “conspiracy theorist”? How different was his treatment for allegedly “spreading rumours” and “acting illegally to disturb social order” from the treatment of those in the Occident who have been deplatformed, smeared and professionally defrocked for attempting to speak truth to power?

I have developed responses to these incursions based on hard-won experiences facing the propaganda blows of an especially powerful political lobby able to seize control of the governing board of my university. These professional lobbyists seek to discredit academic analysis of their own violations of law, ethics and civility by labelling critics of their zealotry as “conspiracy theorists” or worse.

More recently I have been grappling against a variation on this process in trying to counter the censorious attacks on the American Herald Tribune. These assaults on free expression and open debate began with the machinations of military hawks whose hit job instructions were passed along to the disinformation specialists at CNN and the Washington Post.

No one can say for sure where the Wuhan Coronavirus epidemic is taking the world. Wherever we are headed, however, we are leaving behind an era that can never be recreated. Whatever happened to originate the contagion, this crisis is forcing us to take stock of the framework of biological warfare as it has been developing in China, Russia, Israel and probably many other countries.

Nowhere, however, is biological warfare being more expansively and expensively developed and probably deployed than by the US Armed Forces. The death and destruction that humanity is presently experiencing should signal to us that it is time to get much more serious about inspecting military facilities and enforcing the terms of the Biological Warfare Convention of 1972. It is, in fact, time to get much more serious about enforcing all aspects of international criminal law in balanced ways that transcend the biases of Victors’ Justice.

It is time to throw off the weight of the pseudo-laws introduced after 9/11 through abhorrent tactics like the inside-job military anthrax attack on Congress. Most certainly, it is time to draw a clear distinction between research in the field of public health and research in the development of lethal bioweapons. Better yet, we should work towards putting an end altogether to militarization through the massive expansion of the ""death sciences."" The vile activities of fallen practitioners of the endangered life sciences are, for starters, undermining the integrity of our besieged institutions of higher learning.",conspiracy,C01153,pharmaceutical.industry; september.11.attack; vaccine.covid
415,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German drugmaker CureVac, in which the government is taking a sizeable stake to help fund a COVID-19 vaccine, is planning an initial public offering in the United States next month, a finance ministry document seen by Reuters on Monday showed.

The German government plans to invest 300 million euros ($338.5 million) in a 23% holding in previously unlisted CureVac to aid the further development of the biotech company’s vaccine against the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

The finance ministry said in a letter to parliament’s budget committee dated June 15 that CureVac “currently has a big capital requirement and plans a flotation on the Nasdaq in New York in July 2020.”

European biotech firms prefer the Nasdaq because the U.S. capital market offers a critical mass of highly specialised biopharma investors, analysts say.

German biotech firms BioNtech and Morphosys have recently sought U.S. listings.

The ministry added in its letter that the decision to acquire a stake in CureVac had to be made quickly given legal requirements attached to the planned flotation, which is expected to take place in mid-July.

Economy Minister Peter Altmaier on Monday confirmed an earlier Reuters report that Germany will take a stake in the unlisted biotech company. The deal values the firm at 1.3 billion euros.

That follows reported attempts by the U.S. government to acquire CureVac or its assets in March, which stirred a backlash in Germany, with government officials voicing support for keeping CureVac German.

Altmaier said the government wanted to strengthen the life sciences and biotech sectors in Germany, and that it would not have any influence over CureVac’s business strategy.

“With this investment we aim to give CureVac financial security so that it can continue to work on vaccine production with the same commitment,” Altmaier told a news conference.

A government source said the measure reflected German concerns about relying too much on overseas suppliers for healthcare products and equipment.

Reflecting the sensitivity surrounding ownership of the country’s two coronavirus vaccine developers, CureVac and BioNTech, the government gave itself new powers in May to veto hostile foreign takeover bids for healthcare firms.

Dietmar Hopp, co-founder of software firm SAP and owner of a more than 80% stake in CureVac, said none of the existing CureVac investors would sell shares to the government, and that their stakes would be diluted by the deal on a pro-rata basis.",mainstream,M08a36,vaccine
398,"The University of Oxford in the UK has reported positive findings of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate in a small preclinical study involving six monkeys.

This preliminary data of the vaccine, currently in human trials, has been published on the preprint website bioRxiv, noted Reuters.

According to the publication, some monkeys administered with a single shot of the vaccine generated antibodies against the virus within 14 days while all monkeys developed antibodies within 28 days, prior to being exposed to high virus doses.

Following exposure to the coronavirus, the vaccine candidate was prevented damage to the lungs and blocked the virus from replication. However, the virus was found to be actively replicating in the nose.

London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine pharmacoepidemiology professor Stephen Evans said that the animal data was ‘good news’. Evans was quoted as saying: “It is one of the hurdles to be passed by the Oxford vaccine and it has cleared it well.”



The professor also noted that no evidence of immune-enhanced disease, where a vaccine makes the disease worse, was reassuring.

Evans added: “This was a definite theoretical concern for a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and finding no evidence for it in this study is very encouraging.”

Last month, the University of Oxford signed an agreement with AstraZeneca to develop and distribute its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, a recombinant adenovirus vaccine in development by Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group at the university.

Results from the human trial are expected next month, with plans to start late-stage trials by the middle of this year. As part of the deal, AstraZeneca will carry out the development and global manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine.",mainstream,M0aca3,vaccine; vaccine.covid
1263,"Unsubstantiated safety scares have been associated with large declines in HPV vaccine uptake in several countries.

Immunization programs’ resilience to shocks is central to their success, but little empirical evidence documents resilience in action. We sought to characterize the decline of HPV vaccination in Denmark after negative media coverage and recovery during a national information campaign.

We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of all girls born in Denmark from 1997 to 2006 (N = 328,779), aged 12–15. The outcome measure was HPV vaccine uptake (first dose), as reported to the Danish national health registry from 2009 to 2019, when HPV vaccine was freely available to girls in primary care clinics in Denmark. Events that created 4 natural time periods for study were HPV vaccine reaching the uptake of other vaccines in the national program (2009), some negative media coverage of HPV vaccination (2013), extensive negative media coverage (2015), and a national information campaign about the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness (2017–2019).

In the period with some negative media coverage, HPV vaccine uptake fell to 83.6% (95% CI:78.0%–89.7%) of baseline uptake. In the period with extensive negative media coverage, uptake fell even further to 49.6% (95% CI:44.5%–55.2%) of baseline uptake. After the information campaign, HPV vaccine uptake recovered to its baseline level (109.2%, 95% CI:90.1%–132.4%) due in part to catch-up doses. Despite the recovery, an estimated 26,000 fewer girls initiated the vaccine than if uptake had not declined.

The experience in Denmark offers one of the first opportunities to document how a nation grappled with negative media coverage of HPV vaccination and the steadying impact of action by national authorities.",mainstream,M0b726,vaccine
788,"Before COVID-19 was even detected in the United States, Dan Erickson, a former emergency room physician who now co-owns Accelerated Urgent Care in Bakersfield, bought as many tests for the virus as he could. He knew it would be here eventually and wanted to be ready to test those who needed and wanted it.

Now, after testing thousands of people, he and his business partner, physician Artin Massihi, say they have enough data to draw some conclusions about COVID-19.

Their message: COVID-19 is more ubiquitous and less deadly than we think. It’s similar to influenza and we should therefore reopen society and stop treating the situation like the lethal menace it was initially thought to be.

“Two months ago we didn’t know this so I’m bringing it to light now,” Erickson said Wednesday at a news conference held at his Coffee Road urgent care.

Kern County Public Health Services Spokeswoman Michelle Corson and an epidemiologist contacted by The Californian said they didn’t agree with the doctors’ recommendation to end social distancing and immediately start reopening society.

“This is a many-headed hydra. It’s really unfortunate to boil this all down to it’s just flu,” said Andrew Noymer, associate professor of public health at UC Irvine. “There’s no flu season that looks anything like New York does right now.”

Accelerated urgent care has done 5,213 COVID-19 tests at its five Bakersfield locations, Erickson said — which is more than half the 9,197 tests done so far in Kern County. Of those, 340 were positive, according to Erickson.

If that percentage of positive cases were assumed to represent the entire population of Kern County, which is roughly 900,000, it would mean about 58,000 people in Kern have had the virus, far more than the nearly 700 official confirmed, Erickson said.

That many cases would “indicate there is a widespread (COVID-19) infection, similar to flu,” Erickson said.

And if we don’t shutdown the country for flu, should we keep doing it for coronavirus?

“It’s about looking at trends and saying we’re not seeing what they’ve been talking about for the past six to eight weeks,” said Massihi, referring to predictions that up to 100,000 Americans could die of the virus and hospitals would become swamped with patients. “We’ve crippled the economy. There’s a lot of domestic issues going on. Is social isolation warranted for the healthy?”

Using the same calculation, Erickson estimates 12 percent of the population statewide, or some 4.7 million Californians, have already had COVID-19. With about 1,400 deaths so far in California, that puts the statewide death rate at about .03 percent, he said.

“Does that (low death rate) necessitate sheltering in place? Does that necessitate shutting down medical systems? Does that necessitate being out of work?” Erickson asked.

Nationwide, about 42,000 people have died of coronavirus as of Wednesday. Between 30,000 and 60,000 die of flu annually, Erickson said, citing CDC data.

The secondary effects of the shutdown are considerable, too, he said. They include a dramatic decrease in volumes at hospitals and even Erickson’s urgent care practice, where staff are mostly testing patients for COVID-19 these days.",conspiracy,C0081c,vaccine.covid
994,"This year's World Malaria Day marks a critical moment in time as the international malaria community has less than a year to meet the 2010 targets of delivering effective and affordable protection and treatment to all people at risk of malaria.

The RTS,S malaria vaccine candidate was created in 1987 and is said to be the most clinically advanced in the world.



In clinical trials, scientists say, it was the first to demonstrate that it can protect young children and infants in malaria-endemic areas against infection and clinical disease caused by Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly species of the malaria parasite.

636,"The Amish, who don’t get vaccinated, rarely get autism, cancer, or heart disease – coincidence?

Do not talk about whether vaccines work or not, or whether or not they cause autism, unless you’re ready for a very heated debate. Although the link between vaccines and autism is nothing new, to even speak of it can get you labeled as an “anti-vaxxer” or a health fanatic of sorts by the sheeple (brainwashed masses) that believe every vaccine the CDC recommends not only works, but is 100% safe and 100% effective 100% of the time. Even if some vaccines work some of the time, are they worth the health risk? That is the ultimate question, because one statistic you may not know is that children who receive mercury-containing vaccinations (listed as thimerosal usually) are 27 times more likely to develop autism than those who don’t get those jabs. That comes from a recent study based on the CDC’s own data. Still want to keep it a hush-hush topic?

Pediatricians in America are not allowed to question vaccines at all, nor are they allowed to recommend less than the CDC recommends, or they face the wrath of the AMA – the infamous American Medical Association – that finds a way to shut down the “contenders,” sometimes even taking away their license to practice medicine. Big question: would the statistics of autism suddenly bottom out if mercury was removed from all vaccines, including flu shots? (By the way, the CDC lied when they said mercury has been removed from all vaccines).

Nary is a case of autism in the Amish communities of America

For starters, children are not born with autism. It appears during infancy or childhood, and is brought on by an overload of neurotoxins either consumed, injected or ingested from environmental factors, or all of the above. In fact, the recent autism spectrum disorder (ASD) spike over the past two decades in the USA directly coincides with the vaccine schedule increase, by quantity and frequency, enforced by the CDC. To understand why autism is next to non-existent for the Amish, consider that the Amish have been “cut off” from American scientific and medical “progress” for centuries, thus they’ve had less exposure to the major factors that trigger autism, including the most likely proponent–vaccines.

Take a little trip to the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country and try to tag yourself even half a dozen Amish children with autism and you’ll come up short. If statistics matched our national average, there would be about 200 in the Amish community, but to date, there are only three, one of which was adopted and brought over from China. Go figure. Another one actually did get vaccinated and developed autism shortly afterwards. Go figure again.

Here are some universal and national statistics to consider. Autism affects over 20 million people around the world, and occurs in boys four to five times more often than girls. In the US, one in every 68 children has some form of ASD, a 30% increase from just 2012. Why is that, you’re asking yourself? United States kids get 50 inoculations before age seven, many that are combinations containing multiple disease strains, mercury, formaldehyde (yes, embalming fluid for the dead), monosodium glutamate (MSG) and aluminum, just to name a few neurotoxins. Flu shots contain the highest levels of mercury, up to 25,000 times what the EPA allows as a maximum in drinking water and edible fish. Mercury is the second most poisonous element know to mankind.

Due to religious beliefs, the Amish opt out of all vaccines

Fortunately for the Amish, they’re also opting out of three of the most controversial vaccines on the market today: hepatitis B, HPV (human papillomavirus) and of course, the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella combo) that was implicated in the CDC vaccine-autism-link and biggest medical cover-up in history, ever. Conflicting with CDC claims, the multi-dose version of hepatitis B still contains thimerosal (50% mercury). The immature central nervous systems and the liver of Amish newborns are spared this volatile toxin thanks to their parent’s religious beliefs. Amish children experience hardly any learning disabilities at all, in fact. Nor are the Amish experiencing typical US diseases like cancer, heart disease and diabetes. This could all be because they don’t eat GMO, take chemical pharmaceuticals, or vaccines. Surely, no government run regulatory agency will ever run this comparison of Amish health vs. non-Amish health, but the reality speaks for itself.

Still, the CDC refuses to regulate the vaccine industry and instead literally promotes toxic chemicals, dangerous heavy metal toxins, carcinogens and lethal “preservatives” like mercury. It’s all about lifestyle and natural health these days, if you really want immunity that doesn’t come with a boatload of permanent and debilitating “side effects,” like autism spectrum disorder, Asperger’s syndrome or liver cancer.",conspiracy,C00f7f,vaccine.autism
277,"It is one of the most serious allegations that could be made about a doctor: manipulating patients' histories to make money. So it is no wonder that the charges, levied by editors of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in January against medical researcher Andrew Wakefield, are still getting close scrutiny. Now an American whistleblower advocacy group has joined the fray over Wakefield, who in 1998 hypothesized a link, now scientifically disproven, between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) and autism.

 

 On November 9, David Lewis of the National Whistleblower's Center in Washington DC published a letter in the BMJ (http://bmj.com) arguing that Wakefield did not commit research fraud. Lewis told Nature that he thinks the combination of public charges and a slow, secretive investigation has left the public not knowing whom to believe and is unfair to the accused researcher. ""[The system] throws people like Andy into a no-man's-land,"" Lewis says.

 

 Wakefield was the lead author of a 1998 paper in The Lancet (A. J. Wakefield et al. Lancet 351, 637–641; 1998) reporting on the case histories of 12 children who had received the MMR vaccine and developed symptoms of autism or inflammatory bowel disease.

 

 The paper inflamed public fears about vaccines, but it was retracted in 2010 after the UK General Medical Council (GMC) concluded that Wakefield had a charge of serious professional misconduct to answer, in part because it found that his team did not have proper ethical approval for tests performed on the children. Later in the year, the GMC found him guilty of the misconduct charge and revoked his licence to practice as a doctor. By then, more than 12 large-scale epidemiological studies had failed to find evidence of the hypothesized link (J. S. Gerber and P. A. Offit Clin. Infect. Dis. 48, 456–461; 2009) and the MMR vaccine is today regarded as safe.

 

 But was the paper merely mistaken, or a deliberate fraud? Articles by medical journalist Brian Deer published in the BMJ in 2010 and 2011 accused Wakefield of reporting histories for the children that were not consistent with their records and their parents' recollections, at a time when Wakefield was also being paid by lawyers intending to sue MMR manufacturers. Deer's articles themselves did not allege fraud, but on their basis a BMJ editorial in January 2011 called the paper fraudulent.

 

 Wakefield has always denied allegations of manipulating data or having a financial motive in the Lancet paper, but no institution has yet ruled on the matter. In March, University College London (UCL), which took over divisions of the Royal Free Hospital where Wakefield worked, said it had launched an investigation.

 

 In the meantime, Lewis, a microbiologist and former whistleblower who says he was falsely accused of misconduct after alleging links between human illness and the spreading of sewage sludge, asked Wakefield for the chance to review his files. His claims are not likely to challenge the conclusion based on much other evidence that the vaccine does not trigger autism. But they could complicate the debates about Wakefield's integrity and the UCL investigation.

 

 The documents that Lewis reviewed include confidential forms describing biopsies from the guts of children. The forms were filled out by pathologists Andrew Anthony and Paul Dhillon, who worked with Wakefield at the Royal Free. These documents, Lewis says, are relevant to Deer's charge that records he obtained do not support Wakefield's claims in the Lancet paper that the children had nonspecific colitis, a supposed element of an MMR-induced syndrome. On sheets for three of the children graded by Anthony, the handwritten word ""colitis"" appears, and Dhillon checked a box labelled ""non-specific"" on 10 forms. Anthony's sheets are dated after the Lancet publication, whereas Dhillon's are dated before.

 

 Lewis believes that the sheets show that Anthony and Dhillon were making good-faith diagnoses of colitis. Anthony, who has left UCL, could not be reached by Nature, and Dhillon indicated that UCL had told him not to comment. (Neither has been accused of manipulating data.)

 

 Before publishing Lewis's letter, the BMJ asked Ingvar Bjarnason, a gastroenterologist at King's College Hospital, London, to review the materials. Bjarnason says he doesn't believe they are sufficient to support claims in the Lancet paper of a new disease process. He also questions whether ""non-specific"" on the grading sheets refers to colitis, saying it could refer to any kind of gut changes. But he says that the forms don't clearly support charges that Wakefield deliberately misinterpreted the records. ""The data are subjective. It's different to say it's deliberate falsification,"" he says.

 

 Deer notes that he never accused Wakefield of fraud over his interpretation of pathology records. But he says that records read to him from the Royal Free pathology service clearly stated that the children's gut biopsies were within normal limits, even though they were reported in the Lancet paper as having enterocolitis.

 

 Fiona Godlee, the editor of the BMJ, says that the journal's conclusion of fraud was not based on the pathology but on a number of discrepancies between the children's records and the claims in the Lancet paper. She says she will be calling for a public inquiry into the matter, noting that it has been more than a year since she first informed UCL about concerns over Wakefield's work.

 

 Wakefield denies charges of data manipulation. He says that UCL has yet to officially request his response to any charges and he isn't convinced that the inquiry will give him a fair hearing. A UCL spokesman says that the investigation will be ""thorough, fair and wide-ranging"". But eight months after announcing its inquiry, the university is still looking for a suitable external chairman.

1236,"Rinderpest (also cattle plague or steppe murrain) was an infectious viral disease of cattle, domestic buffalo, and many other species of even-toed ungulates, including buffaloes, large antelope, deer, giraffes, wildebeests, and warthogs.[2] The disease was characterized by fever, oral erosions, diarrhea, lymphoid necrosis, and high mortality. Death rates during outbreaks were usually extremely high, approaching 100% in immunologically naïve populations.[3] Rinderpest was mainly transmitted by direct contact and by drinking contaminated water, although it could also be transmitted by air.[4] After a global eradication campaign since the mid-20th century, the last confirmed case of rinderpest was diagnosed in 2001.[5]

On 14 October 2010, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) announced that field activities in the decades-long, worldwide campaign to eradicate the disease were ending, paving the way for a formal declaration in June 2011 of the global eradication of rinderpest.[6] On 25 May 2011, the World Organisation for Animal Health announced the free status of the last eight countries not yet recognized (a total of 198 countries were now free of the disease), officially declaring the eradication of the disease.[7] In June 2011, the United Nations FAO confirmed the disease was eradicated, making rinderpest only the second disease in history to be fully wiped out (outside laboratory stocks), following smallpox.[8] In June 2019 the UK destroyed its stocks of rinderpest virus, held at the Pirbright Institute in Surrey, which were most of the world's retained samples. This followed the compilation of a digital record of the virus's genetic code, thereby obviating the need to store samples as a protective resource in case the virus re-emerges. Researchers at Pirbright and the United Nations expressed a hope that the other samples in laboratories around the world will also be destroyed, totally eradicating the virus from the Earth.[9]

Rinderpest is believed to have originated in Asia, later spreading through the transport of cattle.[10] The term Rinderpest is a German word meaning ""cattle-plague"".[2][10] The rinderpest virus (RPV) was closely related to the measles and canine distemper viruses.[11] The measles virus possibly emerged from rinderpest as a zoonotic disease around 600 BC, a period that coincides with the rise of large human settlements.[12][13]

Rinderpest virus (RPV), a member of the genus Morbillivirus, is closely related to the measles and canine distemper viruses.[11] Like other members of the Paramyxoviridae family, it produces enveloped virions, and is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus. The virus was particularly fragile and is quickly inactivated by heat, desiccation and sunlight.[14]

Measles virus evolved from the then-widespread rinderpest virus most probably between the 11th and 12th centuries.[13] The earliest likely origin is during the seventh century; some linguistic evidence exists for this earlier origin.[15][16]

Death rates during outbreaks were usually extremely high, approaching 100% in immunologically naïve populations.[3] The disease was mainly spread by direct contact and by drinking contaminated water, although it could also be transmitted by air.[4]

Initial symptoms include fever, loss of appetite, and nasal and eye discharges. Subsequently, irregular erosions appear in the mouth, the lining of the nose, and the genital tract.[3] Acute diarrhea, preceded by constipation, is also a common feature.[4] Most animals die 6-12 days after the onset of these clinical signs.[3]

The disease is believed to have originated in Asia, later spreading through the transport of cattle.[10] Other cattle epizootics are noted in ancient times: a cattle plague is thought to be one of the 10 plagues of Egypt described in the Hebrew Bible. By around 3,000 BC, a cattle plague had reached Egypt, and rinderpest later spread throughout the remainder of Africa, following European colonization.[10]

In the 4th century Roman writer Severus Sanctus Endelechius described rinderpest in his book, On the Deaths of Cattle.[17]

Cattle plagues recurred throughout history, often accompanying wars and military campaigns. They hit Europe especially hard in the 18th century, with three long panzootics, which although varying in intensity and duration from region to region, took place in the periods of 1709–1720, 1742–1760, and 1768–1786.[18]

In the early 18th century, the disease was seen as similar to smallpox, due to its analogous symptoms. The personal physician of the pope, Giovanni Maria Lancisi, recommended the destruction of all infected and exposed animals. This policy was not very popular and used only sparingly in the first part of the century. Later, it was used successfully in several countries, although it was sometimes seen as too costly or drastic, and depended on a strong central authority to be effective (which was notably lacking in the Dutch Republic). Because of these downsides, numerous attempts were made to inoculate animals against the disease. These attempts met with varying success, but the procedure was not widely used and was no longer practiced at all in 19th-century Western or Central Europe. Rinderpest was an immense problem, but inoculation was not a valid solution. In many cases, it caused too many losses. Even more importantly, it perpetuated the circulation of the virus in the cattle population. The pioneers of inoculation did contribute significantly to knowledge about infectious diseases. Their experiments confirmed the concepts of those who saw infectious diseases as caused by specific agents, and were the first to recognize maternally derived immunity.[11]

The first written report of rinderpest inoculation was published in a letter signed ""T.S."" in the November 1754 issue of The Gentleman's Magazine,[11] a widely read journal which also supported the progress of smallpox inoculation. This letter reported that a Mr Dobsen had inoculated his cattle and had thus preserved 9 out of 10 of them, although this was retracted in the next issue, as it was apparently a Sir William St. Quintin who had done the inoculating (this was done by placing bits of material previously dipped in morbid discharge into an incision made in the dewlap of the animal). These letters encouraged further application of inoculation in the fight against diseases. The first inoculation against measles was made three years after their publication.[11]

From early 1755 onwards, experiments were taking place in the Netherlands, as well, results of which were also published in The Gentleman's Magazine. As in England, the disease was seen as analogous with smallpox. While these experiments were reasonably successful, they did not have a significant impact: The total number of inoculations in England appears to have been very limited, and after 1780, the English interest in inoculation disappeared almost entirely.[11] Almost all further experimentation was done in the Netherlands, northern Germany and Denmark.

Further trials in the Netherlands

Due to a very severe outbreak at the end of the 1760s, some of the best-known names in Dutch medicine became involved in the struggle against the disease. Several independent trials were begun, most notably by Pieter Camper in Groningen and Friesland. The results of his experiment in Friesland were encouraging, but they proved to be the exception; testing by others in the provinces of Utrecht and Friesland obtained disastrous results. As a result, the Frisian authorities concluded in 1769 that the cause of rinderpest was God's displeasure with the sinful behavior of the Frisian people, and proclaimed 15 November a day of fasting and prayer. Interest in inoculation declined sharply across the country.[11]

In this climate of discouragement and scepticism, Geert Reinders, a farmer in the province of Groningen and a self-taught man, decided to continue the experiments. He collaborated with Wijnold Munniks, who had supervised earlier trials. They tried different inoculation procedures and a variety of treatments to lighten the symptoms, all of them without significant effect. Although they were not able to perfect the inoculation procedure, they did make some useful observations.[11]

Reinders resumed his experiments in 1774, concentrating on the inoculation of calves from cows that had recovered from rinderpest. He was probably the first to make practical use of maternally derived immunity.[11] The detailed results of his trials were published in 1776 and reprinted in 1777. His inoculation procedure did not differ much from what had been used previously, except for the use of three separate inoculations at an early age. This produced far better results, and the publication of his work renewed interest in inoculation. For the period of 1777 to 1781, 89% of inoculated animals survived, compared to a 29% survival rate after natural infection.[11]

In the Netherlands, too, interest in rinderpest inoculation declined in the 1780s because the disease itself decreased in intensity.

Apart from the Dutch Republic, the only other regions where inoculation was used to any significant level were northern Germany and Denmark. Experiments started in Mecklenburg during the epizootic of the late 1770s. ""Insurance companies"" were created which provided inoculation in special ""institutes"". Although these were private initiatives, they were created with full encouragement from the authorities. Though neighboring states followed this practice with interest, the practice never caught on outside Mecklenburg; many were still opposed to inoculation.[11]

While some experimentation occurred in other countries (most extensively in Denmark), in the majority of European countries, the struggle against the disease was based on stamping it out. Sometimes this could be done with minimal sacrifices; at other times, it required slaughter at a massive scale.[11]

A major outbreak affected the whole of the British Isles for three years after 1865.[19]

Around the turn of the century, a plague struck in Southern Africa.[19] The outbreak in the 1890s killed an estimated 80 to 90% of all cattle in eastern and southern Africa, as well as in the Horn of Africa. Sir Arnold Theiler was instrumental in developing a vaccine that curbed the epizootic. The loss of animals caused famine which depopulated sub-Saharan Africa, allowing thornbush to colonise. This formed ideal habitat for tsetse fly, which carries sleeping sickness, and is unsuitable for livestock.[20]

In his classic study of the Nuer of southern Sudan, E. E. Evans-Pritchard suggested rinderpest might have affected the Nuer's social organization before and during the 1930s. Since the Nuer were pastoralists, much of their livelihood was based on cattle husbandry, and bride-prices were paid in cattle; prices may have changed as a result of cattle depletion. Rinderpest might also have increased dependence on horticulture among the Nuer.[21]

A more recent rinderpest outbreak in Africa in 1982–1984 resulted in an estimated US$2 billion in stock losses.[22]

In 1917–18, William Hutchins Boynton (1881–1959), the chief veterinary pathologist with the Philippine Bureau of Agriculture, developed an early vaccine for rinderpest, based on treated animal organ extracts.[23][24]

Walter Plowright worked on a vaccine for the RBOK strain of the rinderpest virus for about a decade, from 1956 to 1962. [25] Plowright was awarded the World Food Prize in 1999 for developing a vaccine against a strain of rinderpest. In 1999, the FAO predicted that with vaccination, rinderpest would be eradicated by 2010.[26]

Widespread eradication efforts began in the early 20th century although, until the 1950s, they mostly took place on an individual country basis, using vaccination campaigns. In 1924, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) was formed in response to rinderpest.[28] In 1950, the Inter-African Bureau of Epizootic Diseases was formed, with the stated goal of eliminating rinderpest from Africa.[28] During the 1960s, a program called JP 15 attempted to vaccinate all cattle in participating countries and, by 1979, only one of the countries involved, Sudan, reported cases of rinderpest.[28]

In 1969, an outbreak of the disease originated in Afghanistan, travelling westwards and promoting a mass vaccination plan, which by 1972, had eliminated rinderpest in all areas of Asia except for Lebanon and India; both countries were the site of further occurrences of the disease in the 1980s.[28]

During the 1980s, however, an outbreak of rinderpest from Sudan spread throughout Africa, killing millions of cattle, as well as wildlife.[28] In response, the Pan-African Rinderpest Campaign was initiated in 1987, using vaccination and surveillance to combat the disease.[28] By the 1990s, nearly all of Africa, with the exception of parts of Sudan and Somalia, was declared free of rinderpest.[28]

Worldwide, the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme was initiated in 1994, supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization, the OIE, and the International Atomic Energy Agency.[28] This program was successful in reducing rinderpest outbreaks to few and far between by the late 1990s.[28] The program is estimated to have saved affected farmers 58 million net euros.[29]

The last confirmed case of rinderpest was reported in Kenya in 2001.[30] Since then, while no cases have been confirmed, the disease is believed to have been present in parts of Somalia past that date.[30] The final vaccinations were administered in 2006, and the last surveillance operations took place in 2009, failing to find any evidence of the disease.[30]

In 2008, scientists involved in rinderpest eradication efforts believed a good chance existed that rinderpest would join smallpox as officially ""wiped off the face of the planet"".[5] The FAO, which had been co-ordinating the global eradication program for the disease, announced in November 2009 that it expected the disease to be eradicated within 18 months.[31]

In October 2010, the FAO announced it was confident the disease has been eradicated.[6] The agency said that ""[a]s of mid 2010, FAO is confident that the rinderpest virus has been eliminated from Europe, Asia, Middle East, Arabian Peninsula, and Africa,"" which were the locations where the virus had been last reported.[6] Eradication was confirmed by the World Organization for Animal Health on 25 May 2011.[7]

On 28 June 2011, FAO and its members countries officially recognized global freedom from the deadly cattle virus. On this day, the FAO Conference, the highest body of the UN agency, adopted a resolution declaring the eradication of rinderpest. The resolution also called on the world community to follow up by ensuring that samples of rinderpest viruses and vaccines be kept under safe laboratory conditions and that rigorous standards for disease surveillance and reporting be applied. ""While we are celebrating one of the greatest successes for FAO and its partners, I wish to remind you that this extraordinary achievement would not have been possible without the joint efforts and strong commitments of governments, the main organizations in Africa, Asia and Europe, and without the continuous support of donors and international institutions"", FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf commented.[32]

The rinderpest eradication effort is estimated to have cost $5 billion.[33]

Stocks of the rinderpest virus are still maintained by highly specialized laboratories.[30] In 2015, FAO launched a campaign calling for the destruction or sequestering of the remaining stocks of rinderpest virus in laboratories in 24 different countries, citing risks of inadvertent or malicious release.[34]

On 14 June 2019 the largest stock of the rinderpest virus was destroyed at the Pirbright Institute.[35]

Rinderpest was one of more than a dozen agents the United States researched as potential biological weapons before terminating its biological weapons program.[36]

Rinderpest is of concern as a biological weapon for the following reasons:
• The disease has high rates of morbidity and mortality.
• The disease is highly communicable and spreads rapidly once introduced into nonimmune herds.
• Cattle herds are no longer immunized against RPV, so are susceptible to infection.[37]

Rinderpest was also considered as a biological weapon in the United Kingdom's program during World War II.[38]",mainstream,M0b0e8,vaccine.covid
731,"Coronavirus: I was in the stay-home-until-it's-safe camp. But I just can't take it anymore.

I’m inherently lazy, so I hate working out. Given my druthers, I’d spend my days eating ice cream bonbons and watching episodes of ""The Real Housewives.""

It’s odd then, that the thing I miss most about the time before coronavirus and stay-at-home orders is going to the gym. For 40 years, the gym has been the thread that tied my physical being to my precarious sanity. Murder trials, surgery and personal tragedies have never kept me from the gym for more than two weeks.

So when rabid armed protesters recently stormed state capitals demanding businesses reopen, the stupidest part of me hoped they would succeed and end my months of gym exile.

Two camps, largely paralleling America’s two political parties, have formed since the initial shock of COVID-19’s global rampage. My status as a die-hard Democrat placed me firmly in the “stay at home until it’s safe” faction. And I’ve not been shy about deriding the gun-toting mobs who insisted on standing shoulder to shoulder as they emptied their lungs at governors who are desperately trying to keep their citizens safe.

Rand Paul, Andy Biggs: Anthony Fauci wants America closed until there's nothing to reopen

But as time has worn on, I’ve abandoned what I thought was the moral high ground in camp stay-at-home. New circumstances have convinced me that cities should reopen sooner rather than later.

A vaccine looks more unlikely

No one but President Donald Trump’s most cultish supporters believed his promise that this virus would disappear with warm weather, or that we could have a vaccine in three to four months. But at the outset of the federal guidelines that placed the United States into suspended animation, many of us believed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and endless government resources, would quickly find a treatment — and a vaccine would follow in due time.

More than two months in, as the U.S. death toll barrels toward 100,000, those assumptions have proved wrong, and the most basic precepts of viral epidemiology have been thrown into question. Usually, when people successfully fight a virus, they develop antibodies that protect against further infection. But people who have contracted and survived COVID-19 appear able to get reinfected after winning the battle of their lives.

The World Health Organization announced last month that the antibodies that normally keep people safe from reinfection might not work against the coronavirus. Since vaccines function by stimulating antibody production, this revelation means the chance of an effective vaccine is far from guaranteed. A stark reality is being whispered by leading health experts: the majority of the world’s population could be exposed to the coronavirus.

When lockdowns began, most of us were willing to stay home and make the necessary sacrifices we believed guaranteed safe passage to the other side. Flights, weddings and dental appointments were rescheduled months down the road.

But given that June is likely to be no different than September, and July no different than November, staying home won’t deliver us to the safety zone that prompted the shelter-in-place orders in the first place.

This isn't a vacation: I'm a survivor of domestic abuse. Quarantine with my father would have been hell.

It’s true that if no one ever leaves home, viral transmission will end. But this is not economically feasible. If the U.S. Treasury continues to print money with little to no manufacturing or labor to back it up, the house of cards will eventually fall. I realize this statement has dropped me into traitor territory. But to the chorus from the left: No, reopening the country due to economic considerations is not the same as saying money is more important than human life.

We face economic realities every day, independent of the coronavirus. Gun violence, drunken drivers, transmissible diseases and a panoply of other dangers could all be brought to a screeching halt if we locked down indefinitely. But a life of home confinement is not a world in which most of us would want to live.

Reopen — with eyes open to the risks

With more states reopening over the next several weeks, people are likely to believe that local health officials have determined things are safe. They’re not. Texas was one of the first states to reopen and recently saw its highest single day of new cases since the pandemic began.

While reopening is a necessity, it need not be reckless. Governors have a continuing duty to tailor reasonable restrictions to community conditions.

The value in early shelter-in-place orders was that overwhelmed hospitals were given an opportunity to stabilize and avoid rationing treatment. That’s a justification worthy of respect, and we should prepare ourselves to accept the possibility of local rolling shutdowns due to filled hospital beds and occupied ventilators.

For the past two months I’ve stayed safe by staying home, limiting my grocery shopping excursions to once a week. I’d like to visit family, but the thought of picking up coronavirus at Trader Joe’s and unintentionally killing my own parents is a Greek tragedy I’m desperate to avoid.

Moving into the third month of home isolation, the toll on each of us is different. Some face financial hardship. Some have seen their education thrown into limbo. For me, the longer I’m home alone, the more my obsessive-compulsive disorder flares. I didn’t realize this until a phone call in which a friend asked whether I was staying safe.

I explained that I had found a way to test myself for coronavirus: Loss of taste is one of the first signs of infection, so I bought a 5 pound tub of jelly beans with 49 flavors. I eat several handfuls daily, one bean at a time. If I recognize each of the different flavors, I figure that I’m safe.

The dead silence on the line convinced me it was time to book a Zoom therapy session.

When the gravity of this pandemic made itself known, I expected my government to protect me. But Trump has spent two months blaming former President Barack Obama for a lack of personal protective equipment, peddling snake-oil cures and denying the shortage of COVID-19 test kits. Sadly, the president has shown that in order to make it through this crisis, we’re going to have to fend for ourselves.

As cities reopen, each of us will have hard choices to make. Choices about working from home, going to restaurants and visiting friends. I’ve decided I’ll go the gym, but not restaurants or movie theaters. I’ve also decided that despite the discomfort, I’ll wear a mask when I’m in an indoor public space — every time.

Staying out of harm’s way in the time of coronavirus promises to be a never-ending struggle to balance risk and reward. I hope I strike the right balance. I cringe at the idea of the progressive Twitter crowd posting news of my untimely demise as a cautionary tale.

542,"America: Home of the HUMAN LAB RATS … Why prescription medications are mostly unsafe chemical experiments that worsen overall health

Most people think it’s completely normal to take prescription medications, believing that our bodies need synthetic, lab-made chemicals to balance or help control bodily functions or biological processes that aren’t performing properly. What other choices do we have, after all?

Put it this way: Medical doctors go to college for eight years to learn how to juggle multiple medications while reading all of your symptoms with fancy technological diagnostic tests, so shouldn’t you just shut the heck up and do what you’re told, when you’re told, without asking annoying, invasive questions that will most likely have boondoggles for answers?

How many people, after all, are not taking at least one medication for anxiety, depression, inflammation, cholesterol, blood pressure, insomnia or pain?

Actually, there are plenty of us, because we know that “Western” medicine isn’t really medicine at all, but symptom-cover-up chemicals for deeper rooted problems that almost always stem from what we eat, drink and put on our bodies.

Are you a “drug abuser” when you simply take the drugs prescribed to you by a medical doctor?

Prescription drugs and their abuse in America date back over a century. It all started with a concoction made with alcohol and opium called Laudanum. Yes, it was a pain “remedy” that doctors cross-prescribed for anxiety, sleeplessness, diarrhea or incessant coughing. Sound familiar?

It was quite addictive, as any watered-down heroin can be. Since women in the 1800s in America were prohibited from drinking at taverns and saloons, they simply went to the doctor for treatment for cramps or emotional problems, and voila!

Currently, about 35 million people abuse opioids worldwide. Unintentional overdoses have quadrupled since 2000. Thanks to drugs like oxycodone (think of Percocet) and hydrocodone (think of Vicodin), the U.S. is the biggest consumer of deadly prescription painkillers.

Did you know that for the past 15 years, death certificates have listed opioid analgesic poisoning as the cause of death more often than cocaine or heroin?

Maybe you’re just addicted to soda, though. Did you know that a doctor invented Coca Cola, but in the process jump-started his own morphine addiction when he added cocaine to this new drink and sold it at a pharmacy in Atlanta during the Civil War? Ask your doctor if soda and addictive, deadly, heroin-based prescription drugs are right for you.

Are you a lab rat in the middle of an extended, insidious experiment being carried out by mad scientists and medical doctors?

Have you been told repeatedly that your health problems are all “genetic?” That’s because doctors want you to believe that there’s no cure, only chemical medication “management.”

Have you been told you have a chemical imbalance in your brain? That’s because you’re consuming chemicals regularly in your food and medicine, including in artificial sweeteners, tap water, prescription medications and vaccinations.

Most prescription drugs and inoculations are never tested for safety or efficacy, but rather are “fast-tracked” through FDA and CDC approval when pharma lobbyists pay regulators millions of dollars to just say “yes.”

In most other instances, scientific “testing” is simply faked, flawed, altered and skewed to produce the results the pharma companies need to make profits and spread more disease and disorder (think of the Swine flu and Zika virus vaccines here).

Even the yearly flu shot is one huge, dangerous medical experiment that the CDC admits is often a failure. Maybe the reason you need prescription medications is because you’re taking prescription medications. Think about that for a minute.

Now do the math: If the flu shot is a hoax, and prescribed painkillers kill millions of people, then do you really believe your prescription medications, which are dished out by the same rogue doctors and scientists, are given with your “good health” in mind?

Let’s take an inside look at what all the American “lab rats” are experiencing.

Chantix (stop-smoking medication) can cause suicidal thoughts. Nexium can cause inflammation of your kidneys and vitamin deficiencies. Vasotec can ruin your liver. Xanax is extremely addictive and abrupt stoppage can cause seizures. Plavix can cause you to cough up blood. Lipitor can break down your muscles, and can cause kidney failure and long-term nerve problems.

Mirapex gives some people hallucinations and causes memory gaps. Ambien can cause impaired thinking. Risperdal can give you muscle tremors and uncontrolled movements (drive recklessly much?). Klonopin can make depression symptoms worse, adding in suicidal thoughts and addiction. Actos and Avandia heighten the risk of heart attacks and bladder cancer.

Hey America … picture yourself blindfolded, drugged up and running through a rigged maze with dangerous traps and no exits. This is the world of flu shots, prescription medications, genetically modified food and fluoridated tap water. It’s time to go organic and natural for good. Talk to a naturopathic physician and question anything that has side effects worse than the condition you’re considering treating. Then research the power of natural remedies at NaturalPedia.com.

• A high school in Michigan has banned unvaccinated kids following a chickenpox outbreak.
• Many schools are grappling with an uptick in unvaccinated kids, which has led to various outbreaks.
• Experts say keeping unvaccinated kids home is the only real way to contain these outbreaks.

Parents of high school students at an eastern Michigan high school have been issued a stark order.

If your children aren’t vaccinated, they aren’t allowed to return to school until they’ve gotten their shots.

Following a chickenpox outbreak at Marysville High School, the St. Clair County Health Department identified 37 students who couldn’t prove they’d been inoculated.

In a letter to parents, health department officials said the affected students won’t be allowed to attend school until they’ve proven that their chickenpox shots are up to date.

While such stories may raise the ire of those who subscribe to the anti-vaccination movement, experts agree that this is a case of a government agency promoting good public health.

“The health department is facing some hard decisions in this case,” Dr. Michael Grosso, chief medical officer and chair of pediatrics at Northwell Health’s Huntington Hospital in Huntington, New York, told Healthline.

“Chickenpox, also called varicella, becomes contagious before the rash appears and remains so until all lesions have crusted,” Grosso explained. “The incubation period is up to three weeks. Of course, administering vaccine to the unimmunized is helpful, but protection takes several weeks.”

While chickenpox was once seen as a benign rite of passage, the vaccine means it’s no longer necessary to suffer through the itchy — and sometimes dangerous — ailment.

“Though most often an uncomplicated, if uncomfortable, viral infection, varicella can attack the liver and brain, cause serious secondary infections, and occasionally lead to death,” said Grosso.",mainstream,M0aed3,vaccine.autism

Look at this headline from USA Today “10,000 Cases of Ebola per Week.” That’s what the World Health Organization says we could be getting in West Africa in a few months. So, why are there no flight restrictions out of West Africa? Do the dimwits at the CDC not understand the concept of quarantine? This is the number one protocol of infectious disease, and many doctors and politicians are saying the same thing. Why not temporarily stop people from coming into the U.S.? Many other countries are banning folks from West Africa, and that is exactly what countries bordering the infected countries did. Not the U.S. The CDC says it can’t fight the outbreak with a travel ban. What? You let more people who are possibly infected into the U.S.? Is this too stupid to be stupid? Now, there are some medical experts who are worried that Ebola could mutate and become airborne. If that happens, expect panic in the general public around the globe.

The stock market is having some wicked gyrations. Look at how the USA Today characterized the big rebound after it plunged 460 points. The headline reads “Bargain Hunters Rescue Stocks From Gut Punch.” Really? Bargain hunters? You mean the USA Today doesn’t know the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets or the Plunge Protection Team is alive and well today? Bargain hunters? Please stop calling yourselves journalists, and just use the term “government spin doctors” because that is what you are. Former Assistant Treasury Secretary Dr. Paul Craig Roberts said the government intervened through the Plunge Protection Team and bought futures on the S&P, and that is the main reason the stock market rebounded. He will come on early next week for updates on multiple fronts.

Also, in economic news, China is the new number one economy in the world, according to the International Monetary Fund. That’s right. America is the number two economy in the world, and it may never be number one again. This is what happens when you offshore all your manufacturing to another country to save a few bucks. Germany didn’t do that with its manufacturing. How can the U.S. dollar remain the world reserve currency when it’s number two? How can the U.S. dollar be a reserve currency with unpayable debt that is growing by leaps and bounds every year? Short answer–it can’t. At some point, the dollar world ends badly.

The two really hot spots for war in the world, Ukraine and the Middle East, are not going well for the West. In Ukraine, there is a declared ceasefire, but that is debatable. What is not debatable is financial warfare being conducted between Russia and the U.S. and Europe. Russia is not happy. The leader of Russia, Vladimir Putin, is letting people know sanctions, or what he calls “blackmail,” does not work and is a “hostile” act. He also reminded everyone that Russia is a nuclear power and warned of creating instability. The Ukraine crisis is far from over. In the Middle East, the air war against the Islamic State is not going well and, shockingly, President Obama admitted it. Even though the bombing attacks continue, The Islamic State is still taking ground and is very close to Baghdad. Now, the Turks, as well as others, want not only to take out The Islamic State, but also take out Assad in Syria at the same time. Well, there is one very big problem with that strategy and that is Russia is backing Assad and has warned of wider war if there are attempts to take him down.

Finally, Harvey Organ’s website of 15 years was taken down by court order. This happened a little more than a month after he made a bold prediction on USAWartchdog.com that the gold and silver price manipulation would end before the end of 2014. was it a coincidence his site was taken down? Maybe, and then again, maybe not. Harvey Organ reports on inventories of gold and silver at COMEX and the LBMA. I have talked to Harvey by phone, and he still does not know why his site was taken down. He told me he’s asked Google for the court order, and it has not been produced. I will book him as soon as he is available. I think that when Mr. Organ came on USAWatchdog.com a little more than a month ago and said silver and gold manipulation is going to end this year, he’s probably hitting a nerve somewhere. His main contention is that gold and silver is in very short supply, and if you don’t have the metal, you can’t control the price.

411,"What happened to little, red-haired Hannah Poling is hardly unique in the world of autism. She had an uneventful birth; she seemed to be developing normally  smiling, babbling, engaging in imaginative play, speaking about 20 words by 19 months. And then, right after receiving a bunch of vaccines, she fell ill and it all stopped. Hannah, now 9, recovered from her acute illness but she lost her words, her eye contact and, in a matter of months, began exhibiting the repetitive behaviors and social withdrawal that typify autism. ""Something happened after the vaccines,"" says her mom, Terry Poling, who is a registered nurse and an attorney. ""She just deteriorated and never came back.""

Parents of kids like Hannah have been fingering vaccines  and, in particular, the mercury-based vaccine preservative thimerosal  as a cause of autism for over a decade, but researchers have repeatedly failed to find a link.

What's unique about Hannah's case is that for the first time federal authorities have conceded a connection between her autistic symptoms and the vaccines she received, though the connection is by no means simple. A panel of medical evaluators at the Department of Health and Human Services concluded that Hannah had been injured by vaccines  and recommended that her family be compensated for the injuries. The panel said that Hannah had an underlying cellular disorder that was aggravated by the vaccines, causing brain damage with features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

A special federal vaccine court has yet to award damages, but the recommendation, made public last week, is causing a sensation in the autism advocacy community. The Polings, who live in Athens, Ga., were originally part of a group of nearly 5,000 families with autistic children seeking damages through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The other cases remain before the court.

The Poling case is also causing deep concern among public health officials, eager to reassure parents that vaccines are safe and, indeed, hugely beneficial. In a public statement on Friday, Dr. Julie Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), insisted that ""the government has made absolutely no statement about indicating that vaccines are the cause of autism, as this would be a complete mischaracterization of any of the science that we have at our disposal today.""

Gerberding and other health authorities point out that the benefits of vaccines far exceed their risks. They also note that thimerosal was eliminated from routinely administered childhood vaccines manufactured after 2001, and yet autism rates have continued to climb. The current CDC estimate is that 1 of 150 American children has an autism spectrum disorder.

Nonetheless, there's no denying that the court's decision to award damages to the Poling family puts a chink  a question mark  in what had been an unqualified defense of vaccine safety with regard to autism. If Hannah Poling had an underlying condition that made her vulnerable to being harmed by vaccines, it stands to reason that other children might also have such vulnerabilities.

But there are circumstances that make Hannah's case a bit unusual. For one thing, she received an unusually large number of vaccines in 2000 (when thimerosal was still in use). Because of a series of ear infections, Hannah had fallen behind in the vaccine schedule, so in a single day she was given five inoculations covering a total of nine diseases: measles, mumps, rubella, polio, varicella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and Haemophilus influenzae. ""That was just too many vaccines,"" says Terry Poling. ""I didn't find out for several months that they had thimerosal, which contains mercury, a powerful neurotoxin. Had I known, I never would have allowed it to be injected into my child.""

Another confounding issue in Hannah's case is the finding that she suffers from a mitochondrial disorder  a dysfunction in basic cell metabolism. Mitochondria serve as power generators for each cell in the body, converting food and oxygen into energy. There are a wide range of these disorders, causing symptoms that vary widely but can include muscle weakness, cardiac or liver disease, diabetes, developmental delays and susceptibility to infection. In Hannah's case, the vaccine court determined that the underlying dysfunction of her mitochondria put her at an increased risk of injury from vaccines.

That decision, however, comes as a surprise to experts on mitochondrial disorders. In response to the Poling case, the United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation has released a statement saying, ""There are no scientific studies documenting that childhood vaccinations cause mitochondrial diseases or worsen mitochondrial disease symptoms.""

Dr. John Shoffner, the Atlanta-based neurologist who identified Hannah Poling's mitochondrial disorder, is ""genuinely puzzled"" by the court's judgment. Shoffner, who has been studying and treating these disorders for 20 years, says it's impossible to say whether Hannah's mitochondrial disorder was, in fact, a pre-existing condition that set the stage for her autism (as the government contends) or if it developed along with her autism. A specialist in mitochondrial disorders, he is investigating the relationship between autism and these disorders and plans to present a paper on the topic at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in April. ""In some subset of people with ASD  a small group of patients, I think  mitochondrial dysfunction is an important part of their disease. But it's too early to say whether it gets the ball rolling or if it comes about after the ball got rolling.""

Experts on autism spectrum disorders believe that most cases are caused by a combination of genetic vulnerabilities and environmental factors. There may be hundreds of roads to autism, involving numerous combinations of genes and external factors.

Could thimerosal or some other aspect of vaccines be one of these factors? ""It's always possible that there's a small subset of kids that have this vulnerability,"" says Dr. Isaac Pessah, director of the Center for Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention at the University of California, Davis. Pessah's lab is looking at dozens of possible environmental factors, including pesticides, plastics and flame-retardants. ""This is a very emotional debate,"" he says, ""and we need more research directed at these questions.""

It's difficult to draw any clear lessons from the case of Hannah Poling, other than the dire need for more research. One plausible conclusion is that pediatricians should avoid giving small children a large number of vaccines at once, even if they are thimerosal-free. Young children have an immature immune system that's ill-equipped to handle an overload, says Dr. Judy Van de Water, an immunologist who works with Pessah at U.C. Davis. ""Some vaccines, such as those aimed at viral infections, are designed to ramp up the immune system at warp speed,"" she says. ""They are designed to mimic the infection. So you can imagine getting nine at one time, how sick you could be."" In addition, she says, there's some evidence, that children who develop autism may have immune systems that are particularly slow to mature.

Van de Water worries that current vaccine schedules may be overly aggressive for some children. She suggests that parents who are concerned about vaccine safety ask their pediatricians to give fewer at a time. And, she adds, don't vaccinate a child when he or she is ill.

Hannah Poling is now a third grader in public school, working one-on-one with teachers in a special-ed classroom. She continues to struggle with the effects of autism and also has seizures. Her parents are hoping her case will spur additional research into the causes of autism, including the roles of vaccines and mitochondrial disorders.

""My daughter's case raises more questions than it answers,"" concedes her father, Dr. Jon Poling, a neurologist who also has a Ph.D. in biophysics. Poling believes in the importance of vaccinating children: ""Vaccines are one of the most important advances in the history of medicine,"" he says, ""but people need to know there is a risk to every medicine. There may be a small percentage of people who are susceptible to injury."" He and his wife would like to see thimerosal eliminated from flu vaccines, which continue to be given to children and pregnant women, a fact that, he thinks, could be one reason autism rates haven't declined. And he urges pediatricians to take a hard look at the schedule on which vaccines are given. ""I think we need a grassroots movement among pediatricians to be more conservative, and not give so many shots at once.""",mainstream,M09344,vaccine.autism
286,"Amid the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, Novavax has been busy fundraising and inking deals to prepare for a manufacturing scale-up. That work continued Monday with the company’s $200 million raise through a private placement.

In the deal with life sciences investment firm RA Capital, Novavax agreed to sell nearly 4.4 million shares at Friday’s closing price of $45.57. The funding provides the biotech “the capacity to execute on our critical priority of providing a vaccine against the COVID-19 pandemic as quickly as possible"" and to submit NanoFlu for FDA review, CEO Stanley Erck said in a statement.

Aside from its closely watched COVID-19 vaccine work, Novavax recently finished a phase 3 trial of the NanoFlu shot.

The Monday deal follows two other recent cash infusions. The first came in the form of a commitment of up to $384 million from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, the group’s largest deal ever at the time. Then, after The New York Times reported the company was left off the list of Operation Warp Speed finalists, the company scored a $60 million Department of Defense (DOD) contract. Under that deal, Novavax will deliver 10 million doses of the vaccine to the DOD this year.

Even as the company advances its COVID-19 vaccine candidate through testing, it’s eyeing steps needed to produce doses at a commercial scale. In late May, the company purchased Czech manufacturer Praha Vaccines for $167 million. Days later, the company enlisted Japan’s AGC Biologics for help producing its vaccine-boosting Matrix-M adjuvant.

49,"The chloroquine narrative started with several small studies from China and France—both of which have shortcomings and offer few lessons for patients at large. The French results are based on only 36 people and focus on the patients’ viral load, or the amount of virus in the body. Indeed, the only patients to die or to be sent to intensive care in the French study had taken hydroxychloroquine.

“We don’t have data from randomised, controlled trials telling us how chloroquine worked in real people,” says Annie Luetkemeyer, an HIV and infectious diseases specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, Department of Medicine.

Self-medication with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin may also come with hazards, as the two drugs might stress the heart and increase the risk of arrhythmia. On Monday, Donald Trump vowed to send New York thousands of doses of the combo for an FDA trial, not long after an Arizona hospital reported one of its patients died after self-medicating on chloroquine phosphate, a form of the compound used to clean aquarium tanks. Nigerian health officials reported two cases of chloroquine overdoses over the weekend.

“The last thing that we want right now is to inundate emergency departments with patients who believe they found a vague and risky solution that could potentially jeopardise their health,” Daniel Brooks, the medical director of the Banner Poison and Drug Information Centre in Phoenix, says in a statement.

ACE inhibitors, drugs that are used widely to treat high blood pressure, have also come under fire during the COVID-19 crisis, with some reports suggesting that patients should stop taking these medications if they develop symptoms.

In a series of letters in the British Medical Journal, Nature Reviews Cardiology, and The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, researchers raised questions over whether ACE inhibitors might help establish coronavirus infections in people’s lungs. The concern stems from the fact that SARS and the new coronavirus enter cells by latching on to a protein called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE2 for short. The protein abounds on the surfaces of cells in the heart and lungs, where it helps regulate a hormone that affects blood pressure constriction.

One consequence of ACE inhibitors is that they may prompt cells to make more ACE2. A 2005 study found evidence of such an increase in mice, and a 2015 study in humans found increased ACE2 levels in the urine of patients who were taking a medication related to ACE inhibitors.

But there is no current evidence that ACE inhibitors worsen COVID-19 outcomes in humans, according to the American Heart Association, the European Society of Cardiology’s Council on Hypertension, and a March 20 review published in the European Heart Journal. Doctors’ overriding advice is that if you’ve been prescribed a medication, continue taking it until told otherwise by your medical provider.

“We should neither be starting nor stopping these medications until we have much more information,” Luetkemeyer says.

People with high blood pressure and heart disease do appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19, but that probably has more to do with the underlying ailments themselves. What’s more, ACE inhibitors may have anti-inflammatory properties, which may help the lungs of COVID-19 patients better cope with the infection. (Learn how these underlying conditions make coronavirus more severe.)

“That would be a key study, to compare people with high blood pressure plus or minus these drugs, to see if there’s any difference,” Perlman says. “But it’d be very hard to do, and probably very hard to ethically justify.”

“By all means, if you’re having emergency breathing symptoms or something’s troublesome, we do want you to seek emergency attention,” says Purvi Parikh, an allergy and infectious disease specialist at NYU Langone in New York City. If you choose to seek help at a local hospital, here’s one example of what you might expect.

At the Inova Health System’s flagship hospital in Fairfax, Virginia, staff have set up an outdoor tent to separate people reporting respiratory ailments from those with other illnesses. The two groups are processed in different parts of the waiting room, separated by at least six feet of space.

Due to a shortage of tests, doctors in many U.S. hospitals say that if people arrive with mild symptoms, these patients are told to assume they have COVID-19 and are encouraged to self-quarantine to prevent overloading hospital beds. In the UK, NHS 111 advises those displaying mild symptoms remain at home, and has set up an online symptom-checker to self-asses how severe any infection may be so the patient can make a decision on whether to seek further help.

For those arriving with serious symptoms such as difficulty breathing, health care workers start by focusing on the patient’s oxygen levels, blood pressure, and the amount of fluid in their lungs—all in an effort to keep their condition stable. They also try to manage fever, which can cause discomfort and lead to cell damage.

The most severe cases of COVID-19 require putting a patient on a mechanical ventilator—a device that cycles air in and out of a person’s lungs—for more than a week at a time. That’s why health officials are so concerned about a coming ventilator shortage. The Society of Critical Care Medicine says that up to 200,000 ventilators exist in U.S. hospitals, but some are older and might not effectively treat COVID-19. Meanwhile, one rough estimate suggests that more than 900,000 Americans could get COVID-19 and need a ventilator. In the U.K. various engineering firms including car, aircraft and vacuum cleaner manufacturers have switched production to meet the demand for ventilators.",mainstream,M081d8,cancer; coronavirus; covid.19; vaccine.covid
428,"Lloyd-Smith and other mathematicians are assessing the strong and weak points in travel screening as it pertains to the COVID-19 outbreak. Their latest work is inspired by a study they published in 2015, which built a model that systematically estimated the performance of traveller screening programs during outbreaks of SARS, MERS, influenza, and Ebola.

As in this earlier work, the new model for COVID-19 includes basic factors like the failure rate for thermometer guns or how easily the virus moves between people. But it also accounts for more subtle variables, like how many people might transmit the virus before their symptoms arise, or how often people accurately report their symptoms on screening questionnaires distributed at airport customs.

 

 “It's pretty evident from past outbreaks that people aren't always honest about risky exposures,” Lloyd-Smith says. “Based on the past data we had, it looked like one in four passengers accurately and honestly reported the risky exposures they had.”

Compute all these variables, and their model estimates that enhanced screening is at best catching 50 percent of infected air travellers and at worst just 20 percent, primarily because COVID-19 symptoms are so latent.

“Based on what we understand about this virus, something on the order of half of people are fundamentally not detectable [during screening],” Lloyd-Smith says. While the results are currently being peer-reviewed at the journal eLife, they mirror what preliminary results from a separate research group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predict for air traveller screening with COVID-19.

 

 “We'd probably only catch about 45 percent of infected travelers using exit screening,” says Samuel Clifford, an epidemiologist at the London School’s Center for Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases. “Out of the remaining 55 percent of people who aren't caught, we can catch a few more on entry. You've got 42 percent of the people [with COVID-19] still making it into the country.”

While such models can offer an indication of what might be happening, you can see these dynamics play out in real-time by setting your sights on one nation: Singapore.

Singapore boasts one of the highest-regarded health care systems on the planet, thanks to public funding, low costs for treatment, and an abundance of doctors, nurses, and other health professionals. This workforce pays off during an outbreak, because it means that Singapore can catch cases the moment patients arrive on their shores.

“Singapore had such a remarkable record during SARS with following cases, and it seems to have a high ratio of detection this time around,” says Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He thinks tracking the COVID-19 situation in Singapore can help gauge how the outbreak might evolve in other countries, especially in areas with developed health care systems or places that receive high volumes of travelers from China.

The United States fits both aspects of this billing, given that it receives as many travellers from China as Singapore, roughly three million a year.

Based on preliminary modelling in Lipsitch’s lab, Singapore ranked first out of 191 countries in disease surveillance during the first weeks of COVID-19. His team suspects that Singapore's methods are exceptionally sensitive to new cases, and can thus serve as a standard of comparison against other health systems.

By using Singapore as a standard bearer for COVID-19 detection, his team can then estimate how many cases are likely going unnoticed in other countries. Relative to Singapore, other nations with a high capacity for disease surveillance—like the U.S., Japan, Thailand, and afflicted countries in Europe —may only be catching 38 percent of travel-related cases, based on Lipsitch’s model.

That’s due in part to Singapore officials’ dogged efforts toward border screening, but also because the island country is dense. Its 5.6 million people are packed into an area on par with Charlotte, North Carolina, which makes it easier to trace the contacts connected to individual cases.

“If there are [COVID-19] carriers coming into the United States that aren’t detected, which is likely the case, Singapore would probably have an equivalent number,” says Scott Gottlieb, a former U.S. FDA commissioner and resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who thinks Lipsitch’s research is on the right track. “But they'd be unmasked sooner in Singapore because it's a smaller, more densely populated nation.” For this reason, Gottlieb says that Singapore offers an omen for major cities in the U.S., rather than the nation as a whole.

“They're a good bellwether for what happens when an outbreak steps into a very sophisticated health care system and advanced economy in a dense environment,” he says.

There are caveats to Lipsitch’s models, including that mild or asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 may not be accounted for. Plus, these models are yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, though the process is under way. But their results mirror what others are predicting about the leaky nature of travel restrictions and what they might mean for preparedness in at-risk countries in places like Africa. The model predicts that up to 89 percent of imported cases might be going undetected in countries with a low capacity for disease surveillance.

And undetected cases passing across borders are such a concern because they represent the first step to local transmission, the stage where an outbreak becomes disconnected from importation and begins to perpetuate freely in a region.

On Thursday, researchers in Singapore, including one from the ministry of health, reported eight of the nation’s 84 cases are yet to be linked to any clear exposure. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 tally doubled in South Korea to 204, due to an outbreak at a church in Daegu tied to a 61-year-old woman known only as “Patient 31.” But the source of her infection is currently unknown.

“Although the total number of cases outside China remains relatively small, we’re concerned about the number of cases with no clear epidemiological link,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation, said at a Friday press briefing. “Apart from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the Republic of Korea now has the most cases outside of China. We’re working closely with the government to fully understand the transmission dynamics that led to this increase.”

More than 80 new cases reported Friday are tied to Patient 31, and Korea’s Centres for Disease Control & Prevention described this incident in Korea’s fourth largest city as a super-spreader event.

“There is a real risk,” Lipsitch says, “that there's ongoing transmission in other countries, which if it remains undetected is going to result in more and more cases.”",mainstream,M0bc53,drug.companies; population.control; vaccine

1272,"Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by a virus that's spread through blood and body fluids. It often does not cause any obvious symptoms in adults, and typically passes in a few months without treatment. But in children, it often persists for years and may eventually cause serious liver damage. Hepatitis B is less common in the UK than other parts of the world, but certain groups are at an increased risk. This includes people originally from high-risk countries, people who inject drugs, and people who have unprotected sex with multiple sexual partners. A hepatitis B vaccine is available for people at high risk of the condition.

Many people with hepatitis B will not experience any symptoms and may fight off the virus without realising they had it. If symptoms do develop, they tend to happen 2 or 3 months after exposure to the hepatitis B virus.
• yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) These symptoms will usually pass within 1 to 3 months (acute hepatitis B), although occasionally the infection can last for 6 months or more (chronic hepatitis B).

When to get medical advice Hepatitis B can be serious, so you should get medical advice if:
• you think you may have been exposed to the hepatitis B virus – emergency treatment can help prevent infection if given within a few days of exposure
• you have symptoms associated with hepatitis B
• you're at a high risk of hepatitis B – high-risk groups include people born in a country where the infection is common, babies born to mothers infected with hepatitis B, and people who have ever injected drugs You can go to your local GP surgery, drug service, genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic or sexual health clinic for help and advice. A blood test can be carried out to check if you have hepatitis B or have had it in the past. The hepatitis B vaccine may also be recommended to reduce your risk of infection.

Treatment for hepatitis B depends on how long you have been infected for. If you have been exposed to the virus in the past few days, emergency treatment can help stop you becoming infected. If you have only had the infection for a few weeks or months (acute hepatitis B), you may only need treatment to relieve your symptoms while your body fights off the infection. If you have had the infection for more than 6 months (chronic hepatitis B), you may be offered treatment with medicines that can keep the virus under control and reduce the risk of liver damage. Chronic hepatitis B often requires long-term or lifelong treatment and regular monitoring to check for any further liver problems.

The hepatitis B virus is found in the blood and bodily fluids, such as semen and vaginal fluids, of an infected person.
• from a mother to her newborn baby, particularly in countries where the infection is common (read more about hepatitis B in pregnancy)
• within families (child to child) in countries where the infection is common
• by injecting drugs and sharing needles and other drug equipment, such as spoons and filters
• by having sex with an infected person without using a condom
• by having a tattoo, body piercing, or medical or dental treatment in an unhygienic environment with unsterilised equipment
• by sharing toothbrushes or razors contaminated with infected blood Hepatitis B is not spread by kissing, holding hands, hugging, coughing, sneezing or sharing crockery and utensils.

A vaccine that offers protection against hepatitis B is routinely available for all babies born in the UK. It's also available for people at high risk of the infection or complications from it.
• close family and sexual partners of someone with hepatitis B
• people travelling to a part of the world where hepatitis B is widespread, such as sub-Saharan Africa, east and southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands
• people who inject drugs or have a sexual partner who injects drugs
• men who have sex with men
• people who work somewhere that places them at risk of contact with blood or body fluids, such as nurses, prison staff, doctors, dentists and laboratory staff
• people who receive regular blood or blood products, and their carers The hepatitis B vaccine is given to infants as part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule and those at high risk of developing the infection. You do not need to pay for the vaccine if your child is eligible to receive it as part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule, or they're born to a mother with hepatitis B.

868,"Trump praises scientists for nonexistent AIDS vaccine, predicts COVID-19 vaccine by the end of 2020

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he believes there will be a vaccine for the coronavirus ready by the end of this year, and incorrectly stated that scientists and doctors developed a vaccine for AIDS, the most advanced stage of HIV.

""These are the people, the best, the smartest, the most brilliant anywhere, and they’ve come up with the AIDS vaccine. They've come up with — or the AIDS, and, as you know, there's various things and now various companies involved. But the therapeutic for AIDS,"" Trump said from the White House Rose Garden.

The president was delivering remarks as he signed an executive order on policing, prompted by weeks of nationwide protests against police brutality and racism in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer.

He said that by the end of this year, he predicts there will be a ""very successful"" vaccine for coronavirus, along with therapeutic medications and a cure. Trump said that even without a vaccine, ""it goes away.""

""We're making tremendous progress. I deal with these incredible scientists, doctors very, very closely. I have great respect for their minds... And they've come up with many other cures and therapeutics over the years,"" Trump said.

Trump credited the same experts for developing a vaccine for AIDS, also mentioning ""the therapeutic for AIDS.""

""AIDS was a death sentence and now people live a life with a pill,"" Trump said. ""It's an incredible thing.""

There is no vaccine for AIDS, but there are treatments and preventative measures. Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is a drug typically taken once daily in pill form with the guidance of a doctor to prevent contracting HIV. There are also antiretroviral therapy medications effective at preventing the virus from progressing in those who are HIV-positive, making it less likely for them to experience symptoms or pass it on to others. HIV is only contracted through contact with certain bodily fluids.

About 38,000 Americans received an HIV diagnosis in 2018, according to CDC data. Nearly 16,000 people who had HIV died that year, the CDC noted, from any cause. In his 2019 State of the Union address, Trump said that he would end HIV transmission by 2030, a task that Kaiser Health News called ""doable but daunting.""

Trump also mentioned the Ebola vaccine on Tuesday in predicting a vaccine for the coronavirus by the end of this year. The FDA approved its first Ebola vaccine in December.

What is AIDS?: Frequently asked questions about HIV and AIDS

Some health care and LGBTQ advocates noted that there is no AIDS or HIV vaccine currently available, and that the cost of PrEP can be prohibitive to many.

""FACT CHECK: There is no AIDS vaccine. In fact, PrEP, a drug that’s highly effective in preventing HIV, can be extremely expensive — and the Trump administration’s program that’s supposed to cover the cost for thousands of uninsured people requires out-of-pocket testing fees,"" tweeted Rep.

842,"Overall, MMR vaccine is implicated in 13% of claims, most of which are events associated with immunization during the second year of life. Natural measles infection is known to cause acute encephalopathy/encephalitis. Although the IOM found the evidence to be “insufficient” to determine whether measles vaccine can cause acute encephalopathy, there is some evidence of clustering of encephalopathy/encephalitis cases whose onset is 8 to 10 days following measles-containing immunization, based on an analysis of 48 VICP claims.111 Only rarely are biological markers demonstrated to support a genetic, metabolic, or vaccine cause. In only one VICP case was cerebrospinal fluid measles antibody, a biological marker for measles causation, found in a previously healthy 2-year-old girl who received the first dose of MMR and varicella vaccine.

New-onset seizures following MMR vaccine was alleged in some claims. Nearly all were febrile seizures occurring in the 7- to 14-day time frame during which fever may accompany replication of vaccine virus. The cases that fell within the VIT onset interval were usually recommended for entitlement by VICP staff. Most such claims were adjudicated before residual seizure disorder was removed from the VIT.

Another common diagnosis was thrombocytopenic purpura, a VIT condition with prescribed onset of 7 to 35 days following vaccination. Most involved children with documented thrombocytopenia within this interval. In some cases, additional episodes of decreased platelets occurred in the ensuing months or years. Many, however, showed normalization of their platelet count before the 6 months of continued effects required by the NCVIA.

Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) claims have also been identified, more than half of them deaths. Early hearings resulted in a few being compensated because of the initial lack of administrative resources to defend claims. Subsequent testimony by experts in infectious disease persuaded the court of the lack of any data supporting a causal connection, noting the tremendous decrease in SSPE incidence since licensure of the vaccine decades ago. Since then, claims of SSPE-related injury or death have been dismissed.

Claims alleging injury from rubella vaccine comprise 2% of claims overall. Most are filed on behalf of adult women who received vaccine in the postpartum period or for employment. In the majority of cases, acute and chronic arthritis or arthralgia developed 7 to 90 days (median, 14 days) after rubella immunization. Neuropathy and fibromyalgia were the other diagnoses. A previous inventory of 113 nonacute arthritis claims filed starting in 1988 showed 28% with chronic arthropathy or other generalized complaints similar to those of chronic fatigue syndrome and 30% with a variety of non–vaccine-related conditions.

Although 13% to 15% of susceptible (serology-negative) women may experience transient arthritis after the currently used rubella vaccine, with a higher percentage (up to 40%) reporting some type of musculoskeletal complaint, it is less clear what role, if any, the vaccine has in causing recurrent or chronic arthropathy (ie, arthralgia or arthritis).78,79

Based on the 1991 IOM finding that chronic arthritis may be caused by rubella vaccine, a special master held a hearing to determine criteria necessary for proof of causation. Following the special master's publication of these guidelines, the VICP added chronic arthritis to the VIT in the 1995 final rule45 and incorporated several of the court's criteria in the 1997 final rule.94 The main difference between the criteria adopted by the VICP and those adopted by the court has been the latter's willingness to compensate arthralgia, a subjective symptom that is difficult to assess, unlike observable signs of arthritis. Adjudications to date have resulted in 70 claims being compensated and 123 being dismissed. Additional research published since the IOM report, including retrospective case reviews and a prospective double-blind study, has produced mixed results. If rubella vaccine does cause chronic arthropathy, it would seem that the incidence is rare.112–114",mainstream,M0b6da,vaccine.autism

There are hundreds of vaccine candidates in development, but the vast majority will fail. Assuming one is successful, it could take years to manufacture billions of doses for the entire globe.

With this in mind, “waiting for a vaccine is a poor, poor exit strategy,"" Heymann argued.

He and other experts say that the idea that a vaccine is the only way out could provide people with false hope and ignore other vital public health measures already at our disposal. For example, politicians could give equal attention to a COVID-19 cure or to more comprehensive testing methods — or promote simple public health measures like hand washing.

“Instead of going for silver bullets and moonshots, the focus should be on doing the hard slog of public health,"" said Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh.

Here are four public health measures that experts say need to be put in place. But spoiler alert: Most require up-front investment and have their own hurdles.

One of the clear ways out is knowing who has the virus.

Testing was key at the start of the pandemic, but as people emerge from lockdown, ""it acquires an even more important position,"" said John Middleton, president of the Association of Schools of Public Health in the European Region.

As the number of infected people dwindles, pinpointing who has the virus makes it possible to put up a ""cordon sanitaire"" and focus on the ill and those they've been in contact with. But it's also vital in another way, he noted, by understanding factors like the geographical extent of the spread.

""You can look at surveillance and population studies to see how far the virus has spread, and what level of immunity there might be in the country,"" Middleton added. ""That could influence how safe it is to [scale back] lockdown.""

There are, as always, obstacles to surmount. First, ramping up capacity has been a problem for many countries. In the U.S., cuts to public health budgets mean that there's a lack of qualified personnel and machinery. Testing capacity there had to be built from scratch, Middleton explained. In the U.K., shortages of reagents meant that testing was reserved for those who were ill in the hospital.

Inaccurate testing is another problem. With popular nasal swab tests, false negatives rates can be as high as three in 10. For more precise blood tests, the opposite is a bigger problem — false positives leading people to think they've contracted the virus and are immune, thus skewing statistics, Middleton explained.

""Politicians have seen it as a beauty contest — how many tests are done — without a proper understanding about the results,"" Middleton said. The good news is that the technology is improving, and better, more rapid tests are coming along, he added.

Austrian geneticist Hans Lehrach, of the Max Planck Institute, thinks it's time for a completely new way of testing.

""This requires a different approach to testing as landing a man on the moon required a different approach than hot air balloons,"" Lehrach said.

Lehrach's idea is that governments could test everyone in a given country or in the EU for five consecutive weeks by genetic sequencing. If countries did this, they could effectively eliminate the virus in that area.

It would require citizens' and governments' buy-in — literally. But so far, governments have been slow to take on this new testing approach.

""Whatever we do will not be for free,"" Lehrach said. But he argues that this approach would eliminate the virus from the targeted area and allow people to go back to restaurants and work knowing ""that everybody they meet is free of the virus.""

If there's one immediate priority that governments should invest in for the short term, it's contact tracing, argues Clare Wenham, assistant professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics.

“The countries that are able to resume normal life — Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea — they ... have the infrastructure to be able to do really granular and effective contact tracing,” Wenham said.

This requires an effective application and staff who can “join the dots.”

“When one person gets infected, [the tracers] can notify who they’ve been in contact with, and reach the people that weren’t on the app for whatever reason. A bank of staff that can do that last mile,” she said.

Numerous European countries are trying to do this already, including the U.K. and Germany. But they're running into two problems. Many of these apps aren't interoperable across borders, so their effectiveness at fighting major public health problems is not known. And many people are afraid of signing up.

“For a lot of Europeans, it’s not a natural thing to have the government tracking everything on your phone and your movements,” said Wenham.

Assuring people that their data is safe, and not being used for any other purposes — for example to be sold to third parties — is key here, Wenham added.

""This is a dataset that would be rich for selling,"" she said. ""You need to make sure that you have that data security.""

One major advantage that therapies have over vaccines is that they're easier to test — and therefore faster to bring to market.

David Salisbury, an associate fellow at Chatham House and former director of immunization at the U.K.'s Department of Health, explained that this comes down to the comparative ease of setting up clinical studies for drugs.

""You test [an] antiviral in people who've got the disease, and you hope to see that those that you treat with the antiviral get better and survive better than those who have a placebo or an alternative treatment,"" Salisbury explained.

""With a vaccine, you've got to show that it stops people actually getting infected,"" he said. ""So it has to be administered in a place where the virus is circulating, and administered in extremely large doses.""

This means vaccine developers are constantly racing to roll out clinical trials in places where the virus is still on the rise. Recently, the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca launched a new wing of its phase 3 clinical trial in Brazil because that's where the ""epidemiological curve is still rising.""

But regardless of whether and when a vaccine is developed, therapies are necessary, say experts.

“We need drugs before we get a vaccine,"" said Nick Cammack, COVID-19 therapeutics accelerator lead at the Wellcome Trust. ""We need drugs while we have a vaccine ... and we need drugs after we get a vaccine, because even for conditions that we currently have vaccines for you still have breakthrough cases.""

The first line of defense is coming from repurposed drugs, he noted at a webinar organized by the Wellcome Trust last week. These are medicines already developed to fight other diseases and are now being tested to see if they help patients.

The two medicines that have been in the spotlight — remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine — fit into this category. However, evidence of their efficacy is, at best, spotty.

Remdesivir, an antiviral developed to fight Ebola by drugmaker Gilead, has shown it can moderately shorten the duration of the disease. Malaria drug hydroxychloroquine promised some early hope but has since failed to pay off, with a major British trial declaring negative results.

In the medium term, antibodies can also be applied as a therapy, Cammack noted. Plasma from people who have already recovered from the disease carries antibodies against COVID-19. If it’s injected into patients that are currently sick, it can give the immune system a boost to help fight the virus.

The problem: You’re limited by the amount of recovered patients you can gather plasma from.

An alternative approach is monoclonal antibodies, which are designed and can be mass-produced in a lab. U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly has brought its monoclonal antibodies to phase 1 trial together with AbCellera, and expects results at the end of June.

""In the next six to nine months we will know if monoclonal antibodies that are specific for COVID-19 show safety and efficacy,"" Cammack said. ""There's much excitement around them as potential treatments.""

Specific antiviral medicines to target COVID-19 — likely to be small molecule drugs — are further away and require a number of trials.

Beyond the measures noted above, experts argue, policymakers need to keep up basic public health work that has become routine since lockdowns started: Washing hands, wearing a mask and keeping distance.

""If [people] are underpinning activities in a country by protecting themselves by social distancing, that's already a major step forward,"" Heymann said.

One of the most important tools for politicians is clear communication, especially considering that the public needs to trust that these measures — testing, contact tracing, drugs and a vaccine, if it's found — are safe.

Trudie Lang, professor of global health research at the University of Oxford, said that this was a lesson first learned from Ebola that's being learned again now: Public health measures are only as effective as the amount of trust the public has in them to work.

“What messages to use? How to gain public trust?” Lang said, also at the Wellcome webinar. ""In the absence of drugs and vaccines, these are things that we are left with.""

And even if we get a vaccine or an effective treatment, one of the clearest messages from public health officials might be that the virus is here to stay.

“This virus is not going to go away. Period,” the World Health Organization’s David Nabarro told the BBC. “We don’t have a vaccine and we don’t know we’re going to develop one … so we’ve all got to learn to live with this virus.”

365,"A source tells PEOPLE of the hosts' work during the coronavirus pandemic, ""They’ve all been doing a great job keeping the show going.""

From left to right: 'View' co-hosts Whoopi Goldberg and Meghan McCain during Monday's taping.

The panel was discussing the Democrats' latest $3 trillion COVID-19 relief bill proposal, which passed in the House of Representatives but is expected to be turned away in the Republican-controlled Senate.

Some Republican lawmakers denounced the relief bill as a ""liberal wish list"" last week — a comparison McCain, 35, repeated on Monday before Goldberg, 64, sent the show to a commercial break as McCain was still talking.

""How are we going to tax people if there's no economy?"" McCain asked as Goldberg told viewers the show would be right back and ushered a commercial break.

McCain is the youngest and only conservative voice represented on The View's daily panel and often clashes with her co-hosts, who largely lean left on political and social issues.

The panels' latest argument came when co-hosts Sunny Hostin and Joy Behar joined Goldberg in calling for the Democrats' sweeping relief bill to pass in the Senate, with both hosts drawing on their own personal financial struggles in the past in forming their view on the issue.

Hostin and Behar both said they want to see the federal government give more aid to struggling Americans, though Behar admitted the $3 trillion that Democrats requested may be too much but that Congress is supposed to negotiate.

Behar, 77, argued the relief bill would help American workers and families who can't go to work and are relying on unemployment insurance. Hostin, 51, then escalated the discussion when she suggested Republican lawmakers have more cynical reasons to turn the relief package away.

“What this is really about is the 'haves' not wanting the 'have nots' to survive this and that is really, really serious,"" Hostin said. ""We have the money. We just don't seem to have the money to save these people. This is what that's about.""

""That is just ridiculous,"" McCain said as Goldberg tried to speak at the same time. ""It's a Democrat wish list.""

""Hold on, I just want to — just let me finish... let me finish my point,"" Goldberg interjected before sending the show to a commercial break as McCain continued speaking.

When the show came back, the panel moved on to talk about the growing public feud between President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama, who appeared to criticize Trump's handling of the pandemic during his virtual 2020 commencement speech over the weekend.

The rivalry between the two political figures is representative of the broader partisanship between those in the Republican and Democratic political parties, including the hosts of The View.

“I think at a certain point, we have to start talking to each other in the middle,"" McCain said. ""We have to start talking about the faults on both sides.”

1099,"The British biotechnology company Microscience has announced successful trials of a new oral vaccine against enterotoxigenic E coli (ETEC) - the most significant cause of travellers' diarrhoea.

The vaccine produced protective immunity in 70 per cent of volunteers who took part in a study conducted at St George's Hospital, London. More research is needed to establish the best dosing regime and the optimum vaccination schedule, and it is likely to take years for the product to become available commercially.

However, the drug uses innovative technology that could herald a new generation of needle-less vaccines: Microscience is now working on oral prophylactics against typhoid, hepatitis B and even anthrax.

Another oral vaccine against ETEC could be licensed in Britain in a matter of weeks. Dukoral is already available in several countries, including Switzerland and Sweden.

ETEC bacteria and cholera produce similar toxins which trigger the outpouring of fluid into the intestine that is characteristic of severe diarrhoea.

Because Dukoral gives protection against this toxin, it has been licensed in some countries as a vaccine for both cholera and ETEC diarrhoea. It has not yet been announced whether Dukoral will be licensed for both when it is launched in Britain.

The old injection against cholera has not been available for years - and it gave negligible protection. Advances in medicine have made cholera a much less fearsome disease, but a new vaccine will be welcome, especially among intrepid travellers and those living and working in the developing world.

Travellers' diarrhoea is a more widespread problem, afflicting at least two-fifths of all international travellers. Although ETEC is the most common cause, it typically accounts for only about two-fifths of cases. The rest are caused by a vast range of bacteria, viruses and parasites - and there is no prospect of developing an effective vaccine against all of them.

1068,"Early morning on May 18, Moderna, a biotechnology company, revealed the preliminary findings for the much anticipated phase I trial of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The information sent Moderna’s stock soaring by more than 20% and helped fuel a rally on Wall Street.

Although there was an enthusiastic response to the news, the purpose of all phase I trials is primarily to demonstrate safety and tolerability. While the early results are tantalizingly positive, what Moderna has not revealed is raising some doubts.

I am a data scientist and was, until last month, working on vaccine development for Zika and dengue fever. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, I have spearheaded building a consortium of more than 100 cancer centers to collect data about cancer patients who have been infected with COVID-19. The purpose of the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium is to rapidly collect and disseminate information about this especially vulnerable population. Having a background in vaccine development, I found Moderna’s press release lacking some key details.

A vaccine imitates the infection to give the immune system a preview of the disease. Vaccination became a public health tool after Edward Jenner showed in 1796 that inoculation with the less virulent cowpox could prevent smallpox. After his son’s death from smallpox, Benjamin Franklin regretted his decision not to inoculate his son against it. Today vaccines are widely credited for the prevention and eradication of many of once feared deadly diseases.

Vaccines prepare the immune system by generating disease-fighting proteins called antibodies, which seek out and attack if the real infectious virus ever shows up.

Traditional vaccines against viruses are either weakened versions of the whole virus that are unable to cause disease; or they are made from signature viral proteins called antigens, that then spark an immune response. An antigen in the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the crown-like spike (S) protein through which the virus latches to the lung and respiratory cells.

However, developing vaccines based on the viral proteins is a slow process because of the difficulties in producing pure proteins at medical standards in large quantities. But now scientists have developed a different type of vaccine: mRNA vaccines.

Rather than giving a person a protein vaccine, researchers are giving them mRNA, which is the biological code that the cells read and translate to make their own proteins. So, instead of the traditional viral protein vaccines, an mRNA vaccine provides a synthetic copy of mRNA-encoding individual proteins from the virus, which the host body uses to produce the viral protein itself. As with other vaccines, the presence of the protein kicks off the body’s immune system to fight the virus.

A big advantage of mRNA vaccines is that scientists can skip the laboratory production of proteins by directly injecting the molecular instructions to make the protein into the human body itself.

Massachusetts-based Moderna Inc. has fast-tracked development and testing of an experimental COVID-19 mRNA vaccine called mRNA-1273. Its collaborators at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) were already working on experimental Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) vaccines, which targeted a closely related coronavirus spike protein. So as soon as the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 became available, Moderna and its collaborators at NIAID got a head start.

With up to US$483 million in federal funds to speed development of a coronavirus vaccine, Moderna began testing the 2019-nCoV vaccine (mRNA-1273) on Feb. 25, 2020.

The phase 1 study of the investigational vaccine, led by the NIAID, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), was designed to assess the safety, tolerability and ability to induce an immune response at three dose levels – 25, 100 or 250 micrograms.

On May 18, Moderna announced the interim phase 1 data. mRNA-1273 was generally safe and well tolerated, except for minor redness and swelling at higher doses.

No volunteers faced any life-threatening events during the six weeks of study.

The mRNA-1273 produced antibodies which could bind the target spike protein at each of the injected doses, in all 45 volunteers (ages 18 to 55). The production of the binding antibodies response from mRNA-1273 injection was similar to the one found in patients who have recovered from previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is important to highlight, though, that even among the survivors of COVID-19, the antibody response is highly variable.

What has not been revealed

Unconventional for a scientific study, data was given from only eight of the 45 volunteers — four each from the 25 and 100 microgram doses, who developed neutralizing antibodies.

Neutralizing antibodies are essential for an effective long-lasting vaccine because they not only bind to the virus, but they block an infection. The age of the eight volunteers is not known. That is important information because COVID-19 is far more deadly for older patients. It’s important to know if this immune response was limited to the younger participants.

Also, the neutralizing antibody response in the remaining 37 volunteers was not disclosed. So it is impossible to know whether the mRNA-1273 was ineffective in them, or whether the results were not available at this point.

The phase 2 trial for mRNA-1273 has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. In this trial each subject will receive two vaccinations – prime and booster – of either a placebo, a 50 microgram, or a 250 microgram dose given 28 days apart.

The amended choice for a higher dose suggests that the lowest 25 microgram dose of phase 1 was not very effective. Moderna expects phase 3 trial to start in July and anticipates to produce 1 billion doses of the vaccine soon thereafter.

894,"Mainstream doctors and media pundits are notorious for claiming that the vaccine-autism debate is over and that no legitimate scientific evidence exists to suggest even a possible link between vaccinations and autism spectrum disorders (ASD): case closed. But a thoroughly-researched report recently published by Arjun Walia over at Activist Post reveals that there are at least 22 published scientific studies that show a link between vaccines and autism and that there are many more out there with similar findings.

 

 Much of the original controversy stems from Dr. Andrew Wakefield’s study back in the late 1990s, which exposed gastrointestinal inflammation as an obvious side effect of vaccination with the combination measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Dr. Wakefield obviously struck a major nerve with his research, which was quickly torn apart by the establishment and maliciously paraded around as being fraudulent, even though his groundbreaking findings have repeatedly been validated and replicated by many other studies.

A 2002 study published in the Journal of Biomedical Sciences, for instance, observed a causal effect between the MMR vaccine and autism, particularly with regards to the measles portion of the vaccine. The researchers from Utah State University concluded that MMR is capable of inducing an abnormal measles infection in some children, which in turn can lead to neurological problems that fall under the umbrella of ASD.

Another study published in the journal Entropy in 2012 observed a strong correlation between the MMR vaccine and autism, except in this case aluminum was the culprit. According to an abstract of this study, vaccines that contain aluminum are particularly toxic to children, who end up later being diagnosed with ASD, as they have insufficient serum levels of both sulfate and glutathione. The aluminum found in some vaccines, in other words, appears to be a primary aggravator of ASD symptoms.

“Regardless of the MMR vaccine and autism debate, there are still a number of studies that link vaccines to a possible autism connection,” writes Walia. “[M]ultiple courts worldwide have ruled in favor of vaccines causing autism, brain damage and other complications that include the MMR vaccine,” he adds, noting that many other side effects besides autism have been observed in relation to vaccines.

Heavy metals, adjuvants, preservatives and other vaccine additives all linked to causing autism

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Walia’s extensive research on the subject is the fact that there appear to be multiple ingredients in vaccines responsible for triggering autism. Besides toxic metals like aluminum and mercury, vaccines also contain adjuvant materials, preservatives and other additives that have all been identified as culprits in the studies listed in his article. Realistically, each of these additives is most likely toxic both in isolation and in combination with the other additives, eliciting compounded toxicity depending on the mixture.

“Oxidative stress, brain inflammation and microgliosis have been much documented in association with toxic exposures including various heavy metals,” admits one study out of Massachusetts General Hospital, which verified that autistic individuals possess a unique type of neuroinflammation in their brain tissue that points to vaccine damage.

Several of the studies listed in Walia’s report also pin thimerosal, a toxic mercury derivative that is still being added to multidose vials of flu vaccine, as a trigger in causing the types of brain damage linked to autism. One particular study out of the University of Texas Health Science Center found that for every 1,000 pounds of mercury released into the environment, there is a consequential 61 percent increase in autism rates.

With thimerosal-containing flu shots now being administered to children as young as six months old, it is highly plausible that ASD-associated brain damage is still occurring as a result of mercury being injected directly into muscle tissue.

• Mymetics Covid-19 vaccine development project based on Mymetics’ virosome vaccine carrier platform, will evaluate different rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 antigens for an effective and safe virosome-based Covid-19 vaccine
• The European vaccine infrastructure, TRANSVAC2, funded by the European Commission through the Horizon 2020 framework, will provide Mymetics access to high quality technical vaccine development services in the fields of antigen production, analytics and animal models

EPALINGES, SWITZERLAND / ACCESSWIRE / June 11, 2020 / Mymetics Corporation (OTCQB:MYMX), a pioneer and leader in the research and development of virosome-based vaccines against life threatening and life disabling diseases, announced today that its subsidiary, Mymetics SA, has received the confirmation to receive access to the European vaccine infrastructure TRANSVAC2 services for the evaluation and development of virosome-based vaccines against Covid-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Since April, Mymetics has started the investigation for the rapid development of a Covid-19 virosome-based vaccine and is thereby partnering with leading academic institutions to start evaluating the most suitable antigens. Through TRANSVAC2, Mymetics will get access to pre-agreed services that Mymetics has requested and are specifically related to SARS-CoV-2 antigen production and animal models.

Mymetics Corporation (OTCQB:MYMX) is a Swiss based biotechnology company, with a research lab in the Netherlands, focused on the development of next-generation preventative vaccines for infectious and life disabling diseases. It currently has several vaccines in its pipeline, among which are the HIV-1/AIDS, intra-nasal Influenza and malaria, and collaborative projects in the field of allergy immunotherapy and in oncology.

Mymetics’ core technology and expertise are in the use of virosomes, lipid-based carriers containing functional fusion viral proteins and natural membrane proteins, in combination with rationally designed antigens. The company’s vaccines are designed to induce protection against early transmission and infection, focusing on both the mucosal and serum immune response. For further information, please visit www.mymetics.com .

TRANSVAC2 is European vaccine research and development (R&D) infrastructure that aims to accelerate the development of safe, effective and affordable vaccines, as they are one of the most successful and cost-effective public health tools for disease prevention. However, vaccine development is time-consuming and complex, requiring a combination of specialised skills and technical capacities not readily available at a single organisation. In order to facilitate access to these skills and capacities, and to promote collaborations in the European vaccine landscape TRANSVAC2 offers high quality technical services across four different service platforms: Technology (for process development and GMP production), Immunocorrelates & Systems Biology, Animal models, and support for Clinical Trials. TRANSVAC2 has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement N° 730964.

678,"Oh, the theory of vaccines sounds great. Inject a tiny bit of the live virus into your blood so you can build antibodies and thus immunity against the “real deal” later. If that’s all there was to it, it could actually work. Then there’s the fear mongering that’s thoroughly “inflamed” and propagated by the press, pharma, and the medical doctors of quack Western medicine. This is where the real money is made. If you get measles you could die! If you get polio you’ll surely be paralyzed for life! If you get Zika, your baby’s head will be shrunken and deformed!

Yet, what if you found out today that the worst odds you or your children have of being infected with disease, disorder, and deformity exist in getting injected repeatedly with neurotoxins, genetically modified bacteria, live experimental strains of multiple viruses and pesticides? Consider this: not one single vaccine ever produced that is recommended by the CDC today has ever been proven safe or effective. Why? They don’t have to prove it. All they have to do is scare the living hell out of everyone using propaganda, and it’s worked for 75 years.

Presenting the 7 most dangerous vaccines injected into humans without any proof of safety or efficacy

#1. Gardasil HPV – Forget for a moment the fact that many girls who get the HPV vaccine beginning at age 9 for a sexually transmitted disease (diseases they don’t have) go into immediate anaphylactic shock and some into comas and die, and let’s just talk about the insane boatload of chemicals the manufacturers put in this concoction that belong nowhere in medicine, ever, especially that which is injected directly into muscle tissue and that which can penetrate the blood/brain barrier. Plus, remember to triple the amounts of these carcinogenic, dangerous, ludicrous chemical ingredients of Gardasil, because there are 3 of these toxic jabs required.

First we have sodium borate at 35mcg. Also known as “borax,” this is the main poisonous ingredient in boric acid that’s used to kill cockroaches. Is your little girl a cockroach? Is it coincidence that the side effects listed and reported with the Gardasil vaccine match those of sodium borate poisoning? No, it’s not a coincidence. Did you know that anything imported into the European Union that contains borax must carry a warning label stating, “May damage fertility” and “May damage the unborn child.” This is what America “recommends” for preteen and teenage girls who are just reaching the age of fertility. Unbelievable!

Then, Gardasil HPV contains aluminum at 225mcg, which causes nerve cell death and helps the vaccine chemicals enter the brain. Let’s not forget that Gardasil HPV contains polysorbate 80 at 50mcg. Polysorbate 80 is used as an emulsifier in foods, but when injected into animals (such as humans), causes rapid, unnatural growth of reproductive organs, causing sterility. This is population control through vaccines, just as Bill Gates once said at a TED conference would be ideal for reducing the world’s population by a few billion. Polysorbate 80 is what causes the anaphylactic shock and also causes cancer and birth defects, while we’re on that topic. Sorry, but there’s not enough time to talk about the sodium chloride at nearly 10mcg.

#2. Anthrax vaccine (biothrax) – The dreaded anthrax jab contains aluminum hydroxide, formaldehyde (yes, embalming fluid for the dead), and benzethonium chloride. In 2009, a study published in the Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry stated that aluminum hydroxide could be the primary cause of Gulf War Syndrome. Aluminum hydroxide causes apoptosis of motor neurons, leading to dementia. Go figure. Thousands of US soldiers given the mandatory anthrax jab are still sick or have died. It was never approved by the FDA, yet any soldier refusing it got dishonorably discharged, fines, and possible prison time. President Clinton’s executive order 13139 gave the DoD permission to experiment on the US military with the highly dangerous anthrax concoction.

#3. MMR II – Under Appendix B, listed on the CDC website, you can find the ingredients for the MMR (MMR-II), the combination vaccines that contain recombinant human albumin, sorbitol, hydrolized gelatin, chick (egg) embryo cell culture, human diploid lung fibroblasts, and fetal bovine serum, among other certain preservatives and chemical adjuvants. In the “ProQuad” version, or MMRV (w/vericella for chicken pox), they’ve added monosodium L-glutamate, neomycin, and MRC-5 cells. And although measles is a respiratory disease accompanied by an uncomfortable rash and fever illness that anyone with a normal immune system will likely survive, the media scares the public into getting jabbed with neurotoxins.

Sorbitol is a synthetic sweetener which metabolizes very slowly and aggravates IBS and gastrointestinal issues. Fetal bovine cow serum is extracted from cow skin and when injected causes connective tissue disorders, arthritis and lupus; also shortness of breath, low blood pressure, chest pain and skin reactions. Sodium chloride raises blood pressure and inhibits muscle contraction and growth. Human albumin is the protein portion of bloodfrom pooled human venous plasma and when injected causes fever, chills, hives, rash, headache, nausea, breathing difficulty, and rapid heart rate. Injecting “pooled blood” can result in a loss of body cell mass and cause immunodeficiency virus infection, or contain SV40, AIDS, cancer or Hepatitis B from drug addicts. Still want that MMR vaccine? Didn’t think so.

#4. Swine Flu – This loaded nightmare hoax vaccine contains inactivated H1N1 virus propagated in embryonated chicken eggs. The multi-dose vials contain over 24mcg of mercury per .5 ml dose! The jab also contains antibiotics polymyxin and neomycin that annihilate good gut bacteria, making the immune system highly vulnerable to infection. Add in some fluid from chicken eggs and you have one of the most experimental jabs ever created and a hoax perpetuated by WHO, GSK and the CDC to profit in the billions.

#5. Polio – This psycho-jab contains inactivated monkey kidney cells, newborn calf serum, embalming fluid, antibiotics, and bovine albumin. Salk didn’t invent the cure for polio–he invented new strains of it by haphazardly combining several. Get the facts!

#6. Influenza vaccine (a.k.a. the flu shot) – Specifically, the “FluLaval” flu shot contains 25 mcg of mercury in one jab. The EPA safety limit for drinking water? Just 5 mcg. Do the math, then consider that shots bypass digestion, breathing, and skin filters. Common flu jabs also contain formaldehyde and polysorbate 80.

#7. RotaTeq for Rotavirus – Three oral doses of this Merck-made horror story cost about $200 and are mandated for about four million infants every year. Rotavirus vaccine contains 5 live strains, plus some fetal bovine serum and porcine circovirus–a volatile and dangerous virus that infects pigs. Side effects of RotaTeq? Difficulty breathing, vomiting and ear infection, followed by bloody stool. Then the intestines get blocked and twisted (known as intussusception) which can be deadly and requires surgery on infant’s intestines. Be sure and call your doctor right away if your child dies from RotaTeq.",conspiracy,C0129a,vaccine; zika.virus
1288,"Scientists suggest that maybe the MMR Vaccine could give some element of protection against coronavirus.

They have discovered that the key proteins in measles, mumps and rubella viruses have some unexpected similarity with certain proteins in the virus causing Covid-19, known as SARS-CoV-2. Their revelation comes as trials are beginning to see if the BCG injection, given to many Brits to prevent TB, can also protect against coronavirus. The Cambridge scientists made their suggestion about the MMR jab after analysing the structure of MMR viruses. They discovered that the “spike protein” of SARS-CoV-2 is 20 per cent comparable to the measles “fusion protein”.[1]

It comes as no surprise that there is no word on the fact that if you have had natural the natural version of the viruses which the MMR protects against, then you may be even better protected from the coronavirus. But then what do you expect from mainstream news.

218,"Mysterious Death: Body of Doctor Who Linked Vaccines To Autism Found Floating in River

Dr. Jeff Bradstreet helped families whose children were believed to have been damaged by immunizations

A prominent autism researcher and vaccine opponent was found dead floating in a North Carolina river last week under what many are calling suspicious circumstances.

A fisherman found the body of Dr. James Jeffery Bradstreet in the Rocky Broad River in Chimney Rock, North Carolina, last Friday afternoon.

“Bradstreet had a gunshot wound to the chest, which appeared to be self inflicted, according to deputies,” reported WHNS.

In a press release, the Rutherford County Sheriff’s Office announced, “Divers from the Henderson County Rescue Squad responded to the scene and recovered a handgun from the river.”

An investigation into the death is ongoing, and the results of an autopsy are also reportedly forthcoming.

Dr. Bradstreet ran a private practice in Buford, Georgia, which focused on “treating children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, PPD, and related neurological and developmental disorders.”

Among various remedies, Dr. Bradstreet’s Wellness Center reportedly carried out “mercury toxicity” treatments, believing the heavy metal to be a leading factor in the development of childhood autism.

Dr. Bradstreet undertook the effort to pinpoint the cause of the disease after his own child developed the ailment following routine vaccination.

“Autism taught me more about medicine than medical school did,” the doctor once stated at a conference, according to the Epoch Times’ Jake Crosby.

In addition to treating patients, Bradstreet has also offered expert testimony in federal court on behalf of vaccine-injured families and was founder and president of the International Child Development Resource Center, which at one time employed the much-scorned autism expert Dr. Andrew Wakefield as “research director.”

The circumstances surrounding Bradstreet’s death are made all the more curious by a recent multi-agency raid led by the FDA on his offices.

“The FDA has yet to reveal why agents searched the office of the doctor, reportedly a former pastor who has been controversial for well over a decade,” reported the Gwinnett Daily Post.

Social media pages dedicated to Bradstreet’s memory are filled with comments from families who say the deceased doctor impacted their lives for the better.

“Dr. Bradstreet was my son’s doctor after my son was diagnosed with autism. He worked miracles,” one Facebook user states. “At 16, my son is now looking at a normal life thanks to him. I thank him every day.”

“I will forever be grateful and thankful for Dr. Bradstreet recovering my son… from autism,” another person writes. “Treatments have changed my son’s life so that he can grow up and live a normal healthy life. Dr. Bradstreet will be missed greatly!”

A GoFundMe page has also been set up by one of Bradstreet’s family members seeking “To find the answers to the many questions leading up to the death of Dr Bradstreet, including an exhaustive investigation into the possibility of foul play.”

Despite his family requesting the public refrain from speculation, many are nevertheless concluding the doctor’s death to be part of a conspiracy.

“Self-inflicted? In the chest? I’m not buying this,” one person in the WHNS comments thread states. “This was a doctor who had access to pharmaceuticals of all kinds. This was a religious man with a thriving medical practice. Sorry, but this stinks of murder and cover-up.”

Another commentor had a more definitive conjecture:

“He did NOT kill himself! He was murdered for who he was speaking against, what he knew, and what he was doing about it. He was brilliant kind compassionate doctor with amazing abilities to heal. He was taken. Stopped. Silenced. Why would a doctor who had access to pharmaceuticals and could die peacefully shoot himself in the chest???? And throw himself in a river?? THIS IS OBVIOUS! MURDER!!”

Funeral arrangements for Dr. Bradstreet are still pending at the Cecil M. Burton funeral home in Shelby, Georgia.

70,"Pharma is looking to reset its image with COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, but landmines loom—with pricing likely the biggest.

The halo from pharma’s rapid response in research and discovery—and the hope that a vaccine or effective treatments will allow the world to return to some sort of normal—has propelled the industry’s reputation at an all-time high. Forty percent of Americans say their opinion of the pharma industry has turned positive during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to The Harris Poll.

However, pricing lurks just beyond the lab. Just this week in media, one well-known pundit posited in a Forbes column that the industry’s reputation hinges on the pricing of Gilead Sciences' treatment remdesivir, while another touted Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla’s promise to not price its vaccine too high in part because “people will not forget if you do that.”

Yet in the same Axios article, Bourla is quoted as saying the vaccine represents a “huge commercial opportunity” for Pfizer. Industry experts say it’s a safe bet that other pharma companies are wrangling with the same contradictory issues.

RELATED: Can the price be right? With the world watching, Gilead faces a no-win decision on remdesivir

Stewart Lyman, a biotech and pharma consultant, said while scientists and researchers will be satisfied with just the discovery of a vaccine, executives at the top of pharma companies will likely want more.

“I suspect they will be very sensitive to not gouging because there will be both political pressure and pressure from the other companies to not do that this one time,” said Lyman, who is also a former scientist at Immunex, now owned by Amgen.

“(But) they’re going to be looking for something in return,"" he added. ""Exactly how that gets sorted out, I don’t know, but one can easily imagine a quid pro quo of some type where they say ‘yes, we’re giving this to you for cheap but let’s not have any price controls’” on other drugs in the future.

The Harris Poll Managing Director Rob Jekielek said pricing alone, whether Gilead's remdesivir or vaccines, hasn't been the key to pharma's improved reputation during the pandemic. Pricing has been a top three issue in Harris Poll surveys since March, but vaccines and treatments—especially vaccines—are what's driving the hockey-stick spike in the industry's reputation.

The bigger pricing issue will be affordability once vaccines and treatments are released, he said, although as he pointed out, that will be a more integrated issue across industries including pharma, insurance, pharmacy benefit managers and others.

""If a vaccine or treatment exists, but Americans can’t afford to get it, especially the most vulnerable or at risk populations—for example, lower income, minority, or living in more densely populated areas—it will likely be a major issue,"" Jekielek said.

Of course, pricing isn’t the only hurdle pharma companies face in navigating their reputations through developing and delivering COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.

Managing expectations—for instance, avoiding overpromising and underdelivering on a vaccine's timeline—is another important consideration, said N. Craig Smith, the chaired professor of ethics and social responsibility at INSEAD graduate business school in France.

Smith pointed to global access to vaccines and treatments, along with manufacturing and distribution issues, as other challenges. He co-authored an MIT Sloan Management Review article about the liability of the pharma industry's competition-based model in COVID-19 drug development.

“There are still questions around how drugs and vaccine get made available, who gets them first and what prices are charged, but I do think there’s a great opportunity here for the industry to come out looking a whole lot better than it has in recent years,” Smith said.

Safety and efficacy of the medicines is yet another consideration. While Operation Warp Speed in both name and effort seems to be focused on speed, Lyman said, safety and efficacy are both more important.

“Coming up with and launching a vaccine fast—but one that is neither safe or efficacious or is just one of those—would be an unmitigated disaster,” he said. “Not just for the COVID-19 programs, but for every other vaccine made these days. Because then you’re going to get people afraid, pushed by these anti-vaccine groups, and starting to question the safety and efficacy of other vaccines.”

RELATED: One COVID-19 opportunity for pharma? A chance to bolster its reputation, Lilly CEO says

Jane Sarasohn-Kahn, a health economist with THINK-Health and blogger at Health Populi, agreed about the vaccine concerns. She has already begun to see shifts in opinions in the past few weeks as the pandemic wears on.

“There’s been an erosion in public support in the U.S. for vaccines—we’ve seen challenges in getting people signed up into trials, and a growing chasm between folks who would plan to take advantage of a COVID-19 vaccine versus those who would not,” she said in an email.

Still, pricing is top of mind not just for pharma companies but for government officials. Consumer pricing bills in both the U.S. House and Senate seek to limit companies from profiting during national emergencies. That includes drug companies and would impose a 10% profit margin for treatments or vaccines.

However, Anthony Fauci, M.D., head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, cautioned at BIO this week that “the federal government shouldn’t force drug companies to lower the costs of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments but should encourage fair pricing,” according to a Bloomberg report.

Where does that leave the industry? In a delicate spot. As Forbes contributor John LaMattina summed up in his column about the importance of Gilead's pricing decision, saying that it “will set the tone for the Covid-19 vaccines and drugs that will follow. It will also impact the reputation of the whole industry. It’s not an easy decision. Let’s hope they get it right.”",mainstream,M09dd5,covid.19; vaccine
76,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- An experimental vaccine against the coronavirus showed encouraging results in very early testing, triggering hoped-for immune responses in eight healthy, middle-aged volunteers, its maker announced Monday.

Study volunteers given either a low or medium dose of the vaccine by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna Inc. had antibodies similar to those seen in people who have recovered from COVID-19.

In the next phase of the study, led by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, researchers will try to determine which dose is best for a definitive experiment that they aim to start in July.

In all, 45 people have received one or two shots of the vaccine, which was being tested at three different doses. The kind of detailed antibody results needed to assess responses are only available on eight volunteers so far.

The vaccine seems safe, the company said, but much more extensive testing is needed to see if it remains so. A high dose version is being dropped after spurring some short-term side effects.

The results have not been published and are only from the first of three stages of testing that vaccines and drugs normally undergo. U.S. government officials have launched a project called “Operation Warp Speed” to develop a vaccine and hopefully have 300 million doses by January.

Worldwide, about a dozen vaccine candidates are in the first stages of testing or nearing it. Health officials have said that if all goes well, studies of a potential vaccine might wrap up by very late this year or early next year.

More than 4.7 million infections and 315,000 deaths from the coronavirus have been confirmed worldwide since it emerged in China late last year. There are no specific approved treatments, although several are being used on an emergency basis after showing some promise in preliminary testing.

771,"“Roadmap on Vaccination” outlines 3 year plan for boosting “vaccine confidence” and advancing “electronic tracking”

A report published by the European Commission in late 2019 reveals that the EU has been looking to increase the scope and power of vaccination programmes since well before the current “pandemic”.

The endpoint of the Roadmap is, among many other things, to introduce a “common vaccination card/passport” for all EU citizens.

This proposal will be appearing before the commission in 2022, with a “feasibility study” set to run from 2019 through 2021 (meaning, as of now, it’s about halfway through).

To underline the point: The “vaccination roadmap” is not an improvised response to the Covid19 pandemic, but rather an ongoing plan with roots going back to 2018, when the EU released a survey of the public’s attitude toward vaccines titled “2018 State of Vaccine Confidence”

On the back of this research, the EU then commissioned a technical report titled “Designing and implementing an immunisation information system”, on – among other things – the plausibility of an EU-wide vaccination monitoring system.

570,"When you hear the term "" ,"" you may think of and the study of the relationships between different species over the span of millions of years.

While the concept of an ""evolutionary tree"" originated in Darwin's "" On the Origin of Species ,"" one can apply this concept to anything that evolves, including viruses. Scientists can study the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to learn more about how the genes of the virus function. It is also useful to make inferences about the spread of the virus around the world, and what type of vaccine may be most effective.

who studies the relationships between epidemics and viral evolution, and I am among the many researchers now studying the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 because it can help researchers and public health officials track the spread of the virus over time. What we are finding is that the SARS-CoV-2 virus appears to be mutating more slowly than the seasonal flu which may allow scientists to develop a vaccine.

Viruses evolve by mutating. That is, there are changes in their genetic code over time. The way it happens is a little like that game of telephone. Amy is the first player, and her word is ""CAT."" She whispers her word to Ben, who accidentally hears ""MAT."" Ben whispers his word to Carlos, who hears ""MAD."" As the game of telephone goes on, the word will transform further and further away from its original form.

We can think of a biological genetic material as a sequence of letters, and over time, sequences mutate: The letters of the sequence can change. Scientists have developed various to help them study how mutations occur over time.

Much like our game of telephone, the genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus changes over time: Mutations occur randomly, and any changes that occur in a given virus will be inherited by all copies of the next generation. Then, much as we could try to decode how ""CAT"" became ""MAD,"" scientists can use models on genetic evolution to try to determine the most likely evolutionary history of the virus.

How can we apply this to viruses like COVID-19?

DNA sequencing is the process of experimentally finding the sequence of nucleotides (A, C, G and T) — the chemical building blocks of genes — of a piece of DNA. DNA sequencing is largely used to study human diseases and genetics, but in recent years, sequencing has become a , and as , viral sequencing will become even more frequent as time progresses.

RNA is a molecule similar to DNA, and it is essentially a temporary copy of a short segment of DNA. Specifically, in the , DNA is transcribed into RNA. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, meaning our DNA sequencing technologies cannot directly decode its sequence. However, scientists can first reverse transcribe the RNA of the virus into , which can then be sequenced.

Given a collection of viral genome sequences, we can use our models of sequence evolution to predict the virus's history, and we can use this to answer questions like, ""How fast do mutations occur?"" or ""Where in the genome do mutations occur?"" Knowing which genes are mutating frequently can be useful in drug design.

Tracking how viruses have changed in a location can also answer questions like, ""How many separate outbreaks exist in my community?"" This type of information can help public health officials contain the spread of the virus.

For COVID-19, there has been a with all scientists. Given a collection of sequences with sample dates, scientists can infer the evolutionary history of the samples in real-time and use the information to .

One such initiative is , an open-source project that provides users real-time reports of the spread of , and many other infectious diseases. Most recently, they have been spearheading the evolutionary tracking of COVID-19 by providing a as well as a meant to be readable by the general public. Further, they enable the global population to benefit from their efforts by translating the situation report to many other languages.

As the amount of available information grows, scientists need faster tools to be able to crunch the numbers. at UC San Diego, in collaboration with the led by , is working to create new algorithms, software tools and computer hardware to make the real-time analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic more feasible.

What have we learned about the epidemic?

Based on current data, it seems as though SARS-CoV-2 mutates much more slowly than the seasonal flu. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have a mutation rate of less than 25 mutations per year , whereas the seasonal flu has a mutation rate of .

Given that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is almost twice as large as the seasonal flu genome, it seems as though the seasonal flu mutates roughly four times as fast as SARS-CoV-2. The fact that the seasonal flu mutates so quickly is precisely why it is able to evade our vaccines, so the significantly slower mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 gives us hope for the potential development of effective long-lasting vaccines against the virus.

107,"Rising mumps cases in vaccinated populations in the United States over the past decade have raised doubts about mumps vaccine efficacy. Here, Lewnard et al. examined these outbreaks using mumps vaccine effectiveness data and dynamic transmission modeling. They found that the increase in mumps cases is more consistent with loss of vaccine protection over time, rather than incomplete protection against an evolving virus population or lack of immune response to the vaccine. Their work also suggested that a third vaccine dose may extend protection, which could prove useful in designing a clinical action plan to prevent the spread of mumps.

After decades of declining mumps incidence amid widespread vaccination, the United States and other developed countries have experienced a resurgence in mumps cases over the last decade. Outbreaks affecting vaccinated individuals and communities with high vaccine coverage have prompted concerns about the effectiveness of the live attenuated vaccine currently in use. It is unclear whether immune protection wanes or whether the vaccine protects inadequately against currently circulating mumps virus lineages. Synthesizing data from six studies of mumps vaccine effectiveness, we estimated that vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps wanes on average 27 years (95% confidence interval, 16 to 51 years) after vaccination. After accounting for this waning, we found no evidence that the emergence of heterologous virus genotypes contributed to changes in vaccine effectiveness over time. A mathematical model of mumps transmission confirmed the central role of waning immunity to the vaccine in the re-emergence of mumps cases. Outbreaks from 2006 to the present among young adults, and outbreaks in the late 1980s and early 1990s among adolescents, aligned with peaks in mumps susceptibility of these age groups predicted to be due to loss of vaccine-derived protection. In contrast, evolution of mumps virus strains escaping immune pressure would be expected to cause a higher proportion of cases among children, not adolescents and young adults as observed. Routine use of a third vaccine dose at 18 years of age, or booster dosing throughout adulthood, may be a strategy to prevent mumps re-emergence and should be assessed in clinical trials.

Over the last decade, mumps outbreaks have thwarted the goal of eliminating indigenous or nonimported mumps virus transmission in the United States by the year 2010 (1, 2). Whereas more than 90% of U.S.-born children experienced mumps infections by 20 years of age in the prevaccine era (3), incidence declined substantially after licensure of a live attenuated vaccine (the Jeryl Lynn vaccine) in 1967, in particular after the 1977 recommendation for its routine use among infants as part of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine (2). Outbreaks among vaccinated middle school– and high school–aged children arose in the late 1980s, followed by sustained reductions in incidence after children were recommended to receive a second MMR dose at 4 to 6 years of age (4). However, an ongoing resurgence in mumps cases began with a series of outbreaks on university campuses in 2006 (2). An older age of infection (ages 18 to 29 years, compared to the prevaccine average of 5 to 9 years) has been a defining feature of these outbreaks (5), similar to recent occurrences in Canada, western Europe, and Asian countries with routine MMR vaccination (6–9). These circumstances are troubling on two fronts. First, as many as 10% of mumps infections acquired after puberty may cause severe complications including orchitis, meningitis, and deafness, in contrast to a milder clinical course in children that typically involves fever and parotid gland swelling (10). Second, most mumps cases in recent outbreaks have been reported among young adults who received two vaccine doses as recommended (11). This observation has prompted concerns about suboptimal performance of the Jeryl Lynn vaccine currently in use (12). It is unclear whether recent outbreaks in vaccinated communities are due to the waning of vaccine-derived immunity or to the emergence of mumps virus strains escaping vaccine-driven immunological pressure. Distinguishing between these possibilities is critical to policy-makers and members of the scientific and medical communities: At issue is whether the re-emergence of mumps can be prevented by modifying vaccine dosing schedules or whether a new vaccine must instead be developed (12). To this end, we sought to distinguish waning of vaccine-derived protection from long-term changes in vaccine effectiveness against circulating mumps strains using data from six epidemiological studies of mumps vaccine effectiveness performed over past decades in the United States and Europe (table S1). Pooling data from these studies, we tested whether the strength of vaccine-derived immune protection declines with time since receipt of the vaccine—a pattern that would suggest vaccine waning—and whether the degree of protection has changed over recent decades amid shifts in the circulating population of mumps virus lineages. We then measured the potential impact of the waning of vaccine-derived immunity on the susceptibility of the U.S. population to mumps over the decades since vaccine licensure and used mathematical models to assess whether recent mumps virus transmission dynamics are more consistent with hypotheses of waning immunity or vaccine escape. Specifically, we compared expected age-specific infection incidence in stochastic simulations of mumps transmission within two hypothetical vaccinated populations. The first was subject to waning protection based on our estimates of the duration of vaccine-derived immunity; the second experienced durable protection but confronted mumps virus strains against which vaccination provided low degrees of protection. We used our findings to evaluate alternative vaccination policies aiming to enhance protection among adults.

Evidence of waning immunity in studies of vaccine effectiveness Uncertainty about the protective efficacy of the Jeryl Lynn mumps vaccine—ranging from 95% after a single dose in randomized controlled trials (13) to <50% two-dose effectiveness during recent outbreaks (14)—has undermined efforts to gauge population immunity. This variation in estimates of effectiveness permitted us to evaluate several hypotheses about the reasons mumps cases have re-emerged among vaccinated persons (2, 12). Fitting a meta-regression model to data from prospective and retrospective cohort studies (table S1), we identified that the time elapsed since receipt of an individual’s last vaccine dose accounted for 66.4% of unexplained variation in published vaccine effectiveness estimates (Fig. 1, A to C). Applying our estimate of the vaccine waning rate to a model of exponentially distributed durations of protection, we estimated that immunity persists, on average, 27.4 years [95% confidence interval (CI), 16.7 to 51.1 years] after receipt of any dose. Among 96.4% (95% CI, 94.0 to 97.8%) of individuals expected to mount primary responses to mumps vaccination, we thus expected that 25% may lose protection within 7.9 years (95% CI, 4.7 to 14.7 years), 50% within 19.0 years (95% CI, 11.2 to 35.4 years), and 75% within 38.0 years (95% CI, 22.4 to 70.8 years). Synthesis of prospective and retrospective cohort studies estimating the relative risk of clinical mumps in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. We illustrate the results of our meta-analysis of studies of mumps vaccine effectiveness, from which we estimated rates of vaccine waning. (A) Shown here is how estimates of vaccine effectiveness (defined as one minus the relative risk (RR) of experiencing mumps for a vaccinated individual, relative to an unvaccinated individual) differ across the six studies analyzed here. Time since last dose accounts for 66.4% of residual variation in estimates after accounting for random sources of between-study heterogeneity.

(B) At 6 months after vaccine receipt (the earliest time point assessed in primary studies), we estimate that 96.4% (94.0 to 97.8%) of recipients are protected; we apply this as our estimate of the probability of vaccine take. (C) A parsimonious model of exponentially distributed durations of protection predicts loss of protection after, on average, years (95% CI, 16.7 to 51.1), as indicated by the yellow-plotted area. The blue-plotted area illustrates the distribution of times to loss of protection for vaccinated individuals, generated by pooling exponential distributions parameterized using estimates of ω . (D) Contrary to the hypothesis of reduced effectiveness against diverse mumps genotypes currently in circulation, we did not identify evidence of a decline in vaccine effectiveness over time, whereas evidence of waning vaccine-derived immunity persisted in a model adjusting for calendar year. Unadjusted estimates of the relative risk of clinical mumps given vaccination—and estimates adjusted for time since vaccination, years since 1964, and doses received—are calculated via meta-regression using incidence data from the original studies (13, 46–50). (E) Using this meta-regression framework, we identified no difference (posterior two-sided P > 0.1) in the waning rate (as defined by the inverse of the association between time since vaccination and relative risk of mumps given vaccination; see Materials and Methods) after receipt of a first or second dose (95% CI, 33% decrease to 72% increase in the relative risk of mumps given vaccination per log year since vaccination; posterior two-sided P > 0.1). The gradual replacement of predominantly A-genotype mumps virus in the prevaccine era by mixed genotypes after vaccine introduction has also been suspected to contribute to diminished protection. However, we found no evidence for a decline in vaccine effectiveness over the years 1965 to 2006, in particular after controlling for the effect of vaccine waning (Fig. 1D). Whereas we estimated a nonsignificant 1.29 (95% CI, 0.70 to 2.37)–fold increase in the relative risk of infection given vaccination for each log year after 1964 in unadjusted analyses, this trend did not persist (adjusted relative risk, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.30) after controlling for longer time since vaccination among older-age subjects in later studies. Moreover, we did not identify a difference in the duration of protection after a first dose of vaccine as compared to the duration of protection after a second dose (Fig. 1E). Whereas second doses were originally recommended to bolster immunity in case of failed “take” of the first dose, our findings suggested that the second dose also restores immunity to the degree achieved before waning of the first dose, thus extending protection to older ages. Together, our findings support the central role of waning immune protection as a driver of variation in vaccine performance. Changes in population susceptibility to mumps virus after vaccine introduction To understand the epidemiologic context of mumps resurgence in older age groups, we assessed how waning vaccine-derived immunity and declining rates of natural transmission have affected the susceptibility of the U.S. population over the decades since vaccine introduction. We inferred the degree of immune protection as of 1967, when the vaccine was licensed, by fitting a mathematical model (table S2 and fig. S1) to reproduce epidemiological dynamics in the prevaccine era at steady state (15). We estimated that the basic reproductive number (R ) of mumps in the United States—the number of infections expected to result from an initial index case in a fully susceptible population—was 4.79 before vaccine rollout, in agreement with previous estimates of 3 to 7 for high-income settings in the 20th century (16, 17). Allowing for loss of naturally acquired immunity did not improve model fit (15), consistent with longer-term persistence of high antibody titers after natural infection in comparison to vaccination in children (18). The ongoing resurgence in mumps among young adults corresponded to cohort-specific changes in susceptibility resulting from vaccine waning and declining transmission over the decades since vaccine rollout (Fig. 2 and fig. S2). We estimated that 52.8% (95% CI, 41.6 to 63.1%) of adults ages 20 to 24 years and 52.6% (95% CI, 42.4 to 61.3%) of adults ages 25 to 29 years were susceptible to mumps virus infection in 2006 at the outset of the ongoing resurgence, in contrast to 33.8% (95% CI, 30.4 to 37.6%) and 25.2% (95% CI, 22.8 to 27.5%), respectively, as of 1990 and <10% in each age group before vaccine introduction. Susceptibility has also permeated older age groups amid the replacement of cohorts that experienced mumps as children. Whereas most individuals ages 65 years and older had natural immunity as of 2016, we estimated that 29.2% (95% CI, 24.7 to 32.3%) of those ages 40 to 64 years were at risk of infection. Mumps incidence and estimates of population susceptibility over time. Here, we illustrate changes in the proportion of the population, by age, predicted to be susceptible to mumps on the basis of the estimated waning rate of vaccine-derived immune protection and the incidence of mumps infection in the population. (A) Overall rates of reported cases declined after vaccine licensure in 1967, punctuated by outbreaks primarily among adolescents from 1984 to 1992 and recent outbreaks (2006 onward) centered among young adults. These outbreaks have corresponded with (B) peaks in the model-inferred proportion of individuals susceptible to mumps infection at 10 to 19 and 20 to 29 years of age, respectively, and (C) reductions in the proportion of infections that cause symptoms and are reported because of vaccine protection against symptoms. (D) Changes in the proportion of individuals susceptible to infection across different ages are plotted against rates of reported cases. In a further validation of model predictions, the emergence and disappearance of mumps outbreaks among adolescents during the late 1980s and early 1990s corresponded to a transient increase in predicted susceptibility at ages 10 to 19 years (Fig. 2). We estimated that susceptibility at ages 10 to 14 years peaked in 1991, when 45.8% (95% CI, 39.3 to 52.4%) of children in this age group were at risk for infection, together with 43.0% (95% CI, 37.3 to 49.0%) of adolescents ages 15 to 19 years. These estimates reflect 2.85 (95% CI, 2.65 to 3.30)–fold and 3.96 (95% CI, 3.43 to 4.52)–fold increases in age-specific susceptibility, respectively, compared to the prevaccine era. Whereas breakthrough outbreaks beginning in the 1980s were hypothesized at that time to reflect inadequate responses of children to their first vaccine dose (19), our findings instead suggest that vaccine waning and declining natural exposure explain why adolescents were the population at highest risk for infection at that time. We estimated that, as of 2016, the prevalence of susceptibility among children ages 10 to 14 years declined to 34.8% (95% CI, 24.3 to 45.7%) because of the recommendation in 1989 for children to receive a second dose at ages 4 to 6 years (4). Whereas most adolescents experiencing cases during the initial resurgence had received one dose of vaccine in keeping with the recommendations at that time (20, 21), recent outbreaks have predominantly included individuals eligible to receive two doses (fig. S3). Thus, the increasing age of infection in the United States more likely tracks with cases due to waning immunity after receipt of the second dose rather than a continuation of cases within a single, underimmunized cohort. These findings hold in sensitivity analyses assuming 1 and 2% annual declines in reporting effort (corresponding to 39 and 63% overall reductions in disease reporting by 2017) over the decades since vaccine introduction (figs. S4 and S5). Our analyses have suggested that reduced vaccine effectiveness relates primarily to waning protection rather than the emergence of mumps virus genotypes escaping vaccine-driven immunity. However, our ability to compare these hypotheses using data from previous studies is limited by a lack of data about genotype-specific protection. To better understand whether recent outbreaks are more consistent with vaccine waning or viral escape, we used a stochastic transmission model to compare expected epidemiologic dynamics under these scenarios in the year 2006, when the ongoing resurgence began. Using the approach taken above to update population immunity and transmission parameters in the absence of waning vaccine immunity (figs. S6 and S7), we simulated the spread of mumps virus strains against which the vaccine provided partial protection in a population of 1 million. Under age-structured social mixing patterns that formerly caused mumps cases to center among school-aged children, waning of vaccine protection is a necessary mechanism to account for shifts in the age distribution of cases toward adolescence and young adulthood. We found that strains capable of vaccine escape would be expected to cause higher-than-observed incidence among younger children (Fig. 3, A to E). In contrast to the median age of mumps cases of 22 years reported in 2006, the predicted median age of cases approached 14.2 years (95% CI, 8.3 to 21.7 years) as strain-specific vaccine effectiveness declined to 0%. Although strains with lower ability to escape immune pressure may not concentrate to such an extent among children, we expected such strains to cause low incidence in a population unaffected by waning immunity (Fig. 3F). Model-predicted overall rates of mumps incidence exceeded reported rates at lower degrees of cross-protection. As compared to predictions under scenarios of viral escape, model-predicted dynamics under vaccine waning provided a closer match to reported overall and age-specific incidence, with an expected median age of 22.3 years (95% CI, 17.7 to 26.3 years) among cases. Anticipated transmission dynamics under scenarios of vaccine escape and vaccine waning. Here, we use a stochastic simulation model to predict the epidemiology of mumps outbreaks under the scenario of mumps virus escaping vaccine-induced immune pressure and the scenario of waning vaccine-derived immunity. (A) A stochastic model of an emerging vaccine-escape strain of mumps virus in a vaccinated population predicts excess incidence in young age groups, in keeping with their higher historical burden of mumps. (B) In contrast, the fit of a model incorporating waning vaccine-derived immunity matches the observed age distribution. (C) Higher overall incidence rates and (D) a younger age distribution of cases are predicted when immune responses to the vaccine offer minimal cross-protection against the circulating strain, as compared to the fit of the model with waning vaccine immunity. (E) Whereas the model with a viral-escape (VE) strain can reproduce the age distribution of cases at low degrees of immunological mismatch, (F) lower-than-reported incidence is expected under this scenario, again in contrast to the fit of a model with waning vaccine immunity. Lines in (E) and (F) signify 95% CIs. If vaccine-derived immunity wanes or confers shorter-lasting protection against genotypes currently in circulation as compared to those circulating in 1967, then administering additional vaccine doses may help control transmission by extending immune protection to older ages. On the basis of analyses of the effective reproductive number (R ), or the number of new infectious cases emerging from a single infectious case under prevailing levels of immunity, we found that protection afforded by two vaccine doses alone is unlikely to support elimination of endemic mumps virus transmission from the United States in the long term. If R stays below 1.0, then epidemics are unlikely to be sustained in the long term; because birth cohorts exposed to high rates of transmission in the 20th century are replaced by individuals whose protection comes only through vaccination, we expect R to approach 1.11 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.13; Fig. 4). Although administering a third vaccine dose by 18 years of age would not necessarily confer life-long protection based on our estimate of the time to loss of immunity, we nonetheless predict that this intervention could extend protection through young adulthood, thereby protecting age groups at risk in recent outbreaks. Low (56%) uptake of a third dose matching adult compliance with recommended tetanus-diptheria toxoid booster doses would be expected to sustain R around 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83 to 0.91), based on transmission dynamics in the United States as of 2016. Under a more optimistic scenario of 88% third-dose coverage—where third-dose uptake equates second-dose uptake among already-immunized individuals—we expect R to approach 0.77 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.79) as cohorts previously exposed to high transmission rates age out of the population. Age-specific immunity and transmission dynamics under two- and three-dose vaccine schedules. Waning vaccine-derived protection in the population raises the question of how additional vaccine doses would affect mumps transmission. To address this question, we evaluated several scenarios. (A) Cohorts over 40 years of age as of 2016 were exposed to endemic transmission before and shortly after vaccine rollout and likely retain life-long protection. However, a population protected only by two-dose vaccination would be expected to experience high prevalence of susceptibility over 20 years of age. (B and C) Our modeling suggests that the duration of protection can be extended through young adulthood by adding a third dose around 18 years of age, whereas routine booster doses every 10 or 20 years would be expected to sustain longer-term protection. Lines and shaded areas delineate median estimates and 95% CIs, respectively. (D) Under transmission dynamics estimated as of 2016, protection in young adult age groups achieved through the use of a third vaccine dose is expected to reduce the effective reproductive number (R ) below 1. We, however, predict R to approach 1.10 under the two-dose schedule as cohorts that experienced high rates of mumps infection age out of the population; larger reductions in R are sustained at higher coverage and with more frequent dosing. Colors are the same as in (A) to (C). R , basic reproductive number. (E) In turn, these extensions of protection provide a stronger barrier against emergence of strains escaping vaccine immunity. A new strain with 8.5% (95% CI, 7.6 to 9.8%) probability of evading vaccine-induced immunity and infecting a vaccine-protected individual would be expected to succeed under a three-dose schedule with low coverage. We, however, estimate that a new strain would require 22.9% (95% CI, 16.4 to 29.7%) probability of infecting such an individual to emerge in a population with 88% uptake of the third dose and 10-year boosters. Lines denote 95% CIs, and shaded areas represent distributions around R estimates. Whereas we estimated that most older adults are currently immune to mumps virus because of previous infection, our modeling suggested that neither a two-dose nor a three-dose vaccination program would be expected to protect more than 50% of adults beyond the age of 40 years in the long term. This concern may motivate the use of routine booster doses in adulthood (Fig. 4). On the basis of our model, we expect that administering additional doses every 10 or 20 years would lead to sustained protection in, at minimum, 68.0% (95% CI, 58.5 to 77.6%) and 55.2% (95% CI, 44.1 to 68.4%) of the population, respectively, under a scenario of 88% vaccine coverage; at the lower (56%) coverage level, we estimated protection among, at minimum, 59.0% (95% CI, 48.2 to 71.2%) and 45.5% (95% CI, 34.3 to 60.5%) of adults with dosing every 10 or 20 years, respectively. Maintaining high prevalence of immunity in the population through repeated dosing may also help to contain emergence of new mumps virus strains (Fig. 4E). To sustain R ≥ 1 under three-dose schedules, we estimated that an emerging strain would require, at minimum, 8.5% (95% CI, 7.6 to 9.8%) to 15.7% (95% CI, 11.9 to 20.3%) probability of causing infection in exposed persons otherwise protected by vaccination. Adding booster doses every 10 years increased this threshold probability to between 16.6% (95% CI, 12.5 to 20.8%) and 22.9% (95% CI, 16.4 to 29.7%) at varying degrees of vaccine coverage.

Resurgent outbreaks centered among young adults have brought renewed attention to mumps after decades of progress toward its elimination from the United States (2, 12). Understanding why cases have re-emerged is essential for determining how to contain the disease through vaccination. Our analyses show that vaccine-derived immune protection wanes over time. We estimate the rate of waning and demonstrate that this waning immunity accounts for susceptibility in the age groups experiencing outbreaks over the decades since vaccine introduction in the United States. In contrast, changes in the circulating genotypes of mumps virus over this same period have not been associated with reductions in vaccine effectiveness; moreover, our modeling suggests that mumps virus strains escaping vaccine protection would be expected to cause disproportionate incidence among younger children, which has not been observed in most recent outbreaks. Guided by these outcomes, our model shows that routine use of a third vaccine dose around 18 years of age, with or without regular dosing in adulthood, could help maintain immune protection in the population. Distinguishing between the contributions of vaccine waning and the emergence of vaccine-escape virus strains to mumps resurgence helps inform whether new vaccines are needed to control transmission (22, 23). Our findings that vaccine effectiveness has not declined amid the replacement of genotype A mumps viruses (from which the Jeryl Lynn vaccine strain was derived), and that the age distribution of recent cases is inconsistent with expectations under vaccine escape, are in agreement with several lines of evidence that mumps vaccination protects broadly against heterologous strains (24). Neutralizing antibody responses to the Jeryl Lynn strain are effective in vitro against wild-type mumps virus strains responsible for recent outbreaks among vaccinated individuals (25, 26), and genetic distinctions have not been identified between strains isolated from vaccinated and unvaccinated mumps patients (27). High efficacy and effectiveness estimates for both the Jeryl Lynn (genotype A–derived) and Urabe (genotype B–derived) vaccines against clinical illness caused by heterologous mumps genotypes further substantiate the notion of cross-neutralizing or monotypic immune responses (12). Although the efficacy of a third dose has not been assessed in clinical trials, several observations suggest effectiveness of extended vaccine schedules. Although congregated U.S. military populations resemble high-risk groups based on their age distribution and close-contact environments, no outbreaks have been reported in the military since a policy of administering an MMR dose to incoming recruits, regardless of vaccination history, was adopted in 1991 (28). In addition, receiving a third dose was associated with protection in a recent observational study after a third-dose campaign undertaken in response to a university campus outbreak (29), building on limited evidence from previous studies where third doses were only administered at the tail end of outbreaks (30–33). Trials demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of adult vaccine doses remain ideal to guide policy around the benefits of routine or reactive use of third doses and may improve our understanding of immunological correlates of protection (34–36). Such trials—or further observational studies—will also play an important role in establishing the duration of protection after third or additional doses in adulthood. Modifying MMR vaccines to improve the magnitude or duration of immune responses against mumps virus may also improve protection. Notably, the mumps component of the vaccine induces lower-avidity antibody responses, and weaker specific memory B cell proliferation, than the measles and rubella components (37, 38). Several limitations of the analysis should be considered. Our use of aggregated rather than individual-level data from vaccine effectiveness studies contributed to an imprecise estimate of the time to loss of immunity, in turn limiting the precision of our estimates of population susceptibility. Individual-level data from postlicensure vaccine studies could support better inferences about the magnitude and duration of vaccine protection, thus aiding policy decisions. Identifying immunological correlates of protection from such data sets would also aid evaluations of alternative vaccination schedules and measurements of population immunity. Second, we lack data on genotype-specific incidence that could help us infer differential protection of the Jeryl Lynn vaccine against circulating strains. Epidemiological studies of outbreaks caused by distinct virus lineages, and in populations exposed to different circulating mumps viruses, can better characterize genotype specificity in the strength or duration of vaccine protection. Last, our analysis addresses mumps epidemiology in the United States, where prevalence of immunity within particular birth cohorts may differ in relation to settings that introduced routine mumps vaccination later or use different vaccine schedules. The burden of cases and prevalence of immunity across ages or birth cohorts should be considered as a basis to guide vaccination policy within specific countries. Analyzing nationally aggregated incidence data sets also limited our ability to investigate how geographic or socioeconomic differences in vaccine uptake and contact rates contribute to the dynamics of focal outbreaks, as might occur in close-contact settings such as university dormitories (39, 40). However, our inferences about vaccine waning and the changing age distribution of mumps cases offer insight into why mumps resurgence has been possible throughout geographically and socioeconomically distinct communities. In this regard, the widespread re-emergence of mumps in vaccine-compliant communities stands in stark contrast to the focal re-emergence of measles in communities with low vaccine coverage (11). Changes in the epidemiology of mumps have implications for disease surveillance. Diminished clinical awareness of mumps, expectations that it appears in pediatric rather than adult populations, and protection against symptoms in vaccinated individuals (41) may limit routine detection of cases and thus bias disease reporting. Serological surveys have provided evidence of higher-than-reported rates of mumps virus infection in the United States before 2006 (28, 42). The tendency to identify outbreak-associated cases through contact tracing may also favor detection of cases in university campuses and other closely connected populations, underscoring the importance of epidemiological surveillance to identify infections occurring in the community. The ongoing resurgence in mumps among young adults has undermined previous enthusiasm about near-term elimination of this disease from the United States (1). Our analysis suggests that vaccinated individuals lose protection against infection on average 27 years after receipt of their last dose and that this rate of vaccine waning explains susceptibility in adolescent and young adult cohorts at the time of postlicensure outbreaks in these age groups. Re-emergence of mumps among older, previously vaccinated individuals whose immunity has waned parallels recent experience with varicella outbreaks affecting immunized communities as a result of waning vaccine-derived protection (43). As demonstrated in mumps epidemiology, immunity in previously infected cohorts may buffer transmission and delay breakthrough epidemics from occurring until decades after vaccine introduction. We expect population susceptibility to mumps to continue increasing as transient vaccine-derived immunity supersedes previous infection as the main determinant of mumps susceptibility in the U.S. population. These observations indicate the need for either innovative clinical trial designs to measure the benefit of extending vaccine dosing schedules or new vaccines to address the problem of waning vaccine-induced protection (44).

Our study is composed of four parts. First, we conducted a meta-analysis of six studies on mumps vaccine effectiveness in the United States and Europe to assess hypotheses of waning protection and diminished effectiveness against currently circulating strains. We then applied estimates of the waning rate from this analysis to infer changes over time in the susceptibility of the U.S. population, accounting for vaccine uptake and incidence of natural infection. We integrated a system of differential equations forward from initial conditions, defined from the prevaccination endemic equilibrium (as inferred over the years 1960 to 1964), by back-calculating transmission rates from reported mumps incidence. We next modeled expected transmission dynamics under scenarios of vaccine waning and viral escape and estimated long-term impacts of adult vaccination schedules on population susceptibility. Full technical details pertaining to our analyses are presented in Supplementary Materials and Methods (a brief summary is provided here). We performed a systematic review of prospective and retrospective cohort studies calculating effectiveness of the Jeryl Lynn strain mumps vaccine via a PubMed search and citation tracking. Details of the studies used to infer vaccine effectiveness are listed in table S1. We used an inverse variance-weighted meta-regression model, accounting for study-level heterogeneity, to measure unadjusted and multivariate-adjusted associations of the following variables with study-level estimates of the relative risk of infection associated with vaccination: (i) time since receipt of the last vaccine dose, indicating waning vaccine immunity; (ii) time from 1964 (when the Jeryl Lynn vaccine was developed) to the year of mumps exposure, indicating long-term changes in vaccine effectiveness associated with changes in circulating genotypes; and (iii) vaccine doses received, with an interaction term for time since the last dose to test for differential waning of first and second doses. Regression model summary statistics indicated the proportion of variance explained by these covariates. We used our estimate of the association between instantaneous risk of infection and time since vaccination to fit an exponential distribution to the duration of vaccine-derived immune protection and used this fitted distribution as the basis for further modeling. We used a system of ordinary differential equations to describe changes in the population of susceptible and protected persons, partitioned into those who had and had not received mumps vaccines. Updating the model to address the contributions of vaccination and vaccine waning to population immunity, we back-calculated changes in natural immunity in the population based on the relation between reported incidence rates (Λ) in age group i and year t and the force of infection to which individuals were exposed (λ), the populations of susceptible unvaccinated (S) and vaccinated (F) persons, and the probabilities (π and π , respectively) for these individuals to experience symptoms if infected. As described in Supplementary Materials and Methods, this approach allowed us to account for changes over time in transmission patterns leading to time-varying estimates of the basic reproductive number. Susceptible vaccinated persons (F) comprised those failing to mount an immune response immediately after vaccination (primary vaccine failure) and those whose initial protection had waned (secondary vaccine failure). Model parameter values and their sources are listed in table S2. Age-specific incidence reports were collated from nationwide surveillance (45). Our model accounted for age-structured mixing among individuals partitioned across 10 age classes (0 to 11 months, 1 to 4 years, 5 to 9 years, 10 to 14 years, 15 to 19 years, 20 to 24 years, 25 to 29 years, 30 to 39 years, 40 to 64 years, and ≥65 years). Members of the ith age class encountered the force of infection cumulatively through interactions with infectious individuals (I) distributed across all j age classes; the matrix C conveyed age-specific mixing patterns. We inferred starting-time age-specific prevalence of immunity in the U.S. population (as of 1967) by fitting a mathematical model of mumps transmission to recapitulate age-specific incidence in the prevaccine era at steady state. To compare predicted incidence during an introduced outbreak against observations from the year 2006, we implemented stochastic realizations of extended versions of the model under scenarios where we assumed waning of immunity or circulation of strains with differential risk of infecting persons protected by vaccination. We assessed which scenario was more consistent with epidemiological observations on the basis of model-predicted age-specific and overall incidence rates, as well as the predicted median age of infection. We compared the long-term performance of different vaccination schedules including the addition of a third dose by 18 years of age and the use of routine boosters at 10- or 20-year intervals through adulthood. We calculated the prevalence of age-specific immune protection achieved under these strategies and resulting values of the effective reproductive number (R ), describing the number of cases an infectious individual would be expected to cause under prevailing conditions. We also calculated the minimum probability of immune escape a novel mumps virus strain would need to invade a population protected under these different strategies, defined as the minimum probability of infecting a vaccinated, protected individual upon exposure such that R ≥ 1.

1111,"Kentucky Derby fans may need to take some extra precautions before heading off to the races.

The Indiana State Department of Health is recommending that its residents get vaccinated against hepatitis A and take other steps to protect themselves from the illness before traveling to Kentucky or Michigan, both of which are experiencing large outbreaks of the viral infection.

Kentucky has reported more than 300 cases of hepatitis A since November 2017, with 39 new cases reported in the first week of April, according to the Kentucky Department for Public Health. Most cases in the state have occurred around Louisville — the city where the Kentucky Derby is held. The famous horse race, which draws more than 150,000 people each year, takes place on the first Saturday in May.

""With popular tourist events coming up in other states, we know many Hoosiers will be traveling to areas impacted by hepatitis A, and we want them to be safe,"" Pam Pontones, the Indiana deputy state health commissioner, said in a statement. ""Getting vaccinated and thoroughly washing your hands before and after preparing food and eating and after using the restroom are simple, safe and effective ways to prevent the spread of hepatitis A.""

But do you really need to get a hepatitis A vaccine if you're going to the Kentucky Derby?

Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the Indiana recommendation is an interesting step to take, and it's not a bad idea. ""I can see why they would advise it,"" Adalja said. ""It's something that's an easy measure that can minimize risk."" [27 Devastating Infectious Diseases]

At the same time, Adalja told Live Science that the risk of hepatitis A probably isn't very high for the average visitor to the Derby. A number of recent U.S. hepatitis A outbreaks, including the one in Kentucky, have occurred primarily among the homeless population and illicit-drug users — a group that may have limited access to clean toilets and handwashing facilities, which are important in preventing the spread of hepatitis A.

But hepatitis A outbreaks can also occur through contaminated food, Adalja noted — for instance, if food workers contract the illness and handle food without properly washing their hands. (The Kentucky hepatitis A outbreak has not been linked with contaminated food, although it was recently reported that a McDonald's employee in Berea, Kentucky, south of Lexington, had the infection and could have potentially spread it to customers.) If Kentucky Derby-goers want to minimize their risk of getting the illness, ""the vaccine is one way to do that,"" Adalja said.

Hepatitis A is a contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus is spread through the ""fecal-oral"" route — that is, when small amounts of stool from an ill person contaminate objects, food or drinks that are then touched and ingested by another person, the CDC says. For this reason, thorough handwashing — particularly after using the bathroom or changing a child's diaper, or before eating — can help reduce a person's risk of getting hepatitis A, according to the Mayo Clinic.

It's important to note that the Indiana announcement is not a nationwide recommendation. In general, the CDC recommends the hepatitis vaccine for children at age 1, as well as adults who may be at higher risk for hepatitis A or for complications from the illness. These include travelers to countries where hepatitis A is common, people who use recreational drugs, people with chronic liver disease, men who have sexual contact with other men, and people who have direct contact with others who have hepatitis A.

The CDC says that ideally, a person should get the hepatitis vaccine two weeks or more before departing for their trip, but getting the vaccine any time before travel will provide some protection.

Adalja noted that a number of Americans are already vaccinated against hepatitis A. The vaccine was first licensed in 1995 and was recommended for all U.S. children starting in 2006. But that would still leave many adults today unvaccinated, unless they already got the vaccine for travel or because they fall into a group that's at higher risk for contracting the illness.

44,"This book provides clinicians and their staff with essential information on the vaccines that are recommended and not recommended for their patients, the diseases these vaccines prevent, and a broad range of potential vaccine safety issues that may be brought up by their patients.

Each topic, from specific vaccines to safety concerns, is covered succinctly, based upon systematic reviews of the scientific literature, with talking points to be used with patients. The organization of the information makes it easy to reference specific topics and quickly find pertinent information, with the most practical details (such as recommendations and causality conclusions) highlighted at the very beginning of the respective sections. There are also sections outlining the vaccine safety system and evidence-based strategies for how to talk with patients about vaccines. This book aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical vaccine discussions with patients, leading to more informed patients and timely vaccination.

422,"The hypothesis that MMR vaccine can cause autism and Crohn's disease, mainly suggested by Wakefield, has been discussed at length (SED-14, 1079; SEDA-25, 387; SEDA-26, 359; SEDA-27, 338). Subsequently, it became known that Dr Wakefield was paid for a second study into whether children allegedly damaged by the MMR could sue. The MMR research was therefore compromised by a financial conflict of interests. The Editor of the Lancet concluded, “If we knew then what we know now, we certainly would not have published the part of the paper (43c) that related to MMR” (44S). In March 2004, 10 of the 12 authors of the article in question issued a “Retraction of an interpretation”. The authors made it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between MMR vaccine and autism, as the data were insufficient to prove the hypothesis (45S).

In 2004, the Vaccine Safety Committee of the Institute of Medicine of the US National Academies of Sciences published the Immunization Safety Review on Vaccines and Autism. The Committee examined the hypothesis that vaccines, specifically the MMR vaccine and thiomersal-containing vaccines, are causally associated with autism. The Committee concluded that the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relation between the MMR vaccine and autism as well as a causal relation between thiomersal-containing vaccines and autism. The Committee further found that potential biological mechanisms for vaccine-induced autism that have been generated to date are theoretical only. In addition, the Committee recommended that available funding for autism research be channelled to the most promising areas (46M).

The results of a retrospective study including 535 544 children aged 1–7 years who were immunized between November 1982 and June 1986 in Finland, based on linkage of individual MMR immunization data to a hospital discharge register, have been published (47C). The numbers of cases of encephalitis and aseptic meningitis within a 3-month risk interval after immunization were compared with the estimated numbers of naturally occurring cases of encephalitis and aseptic meningitis during the subsequent 3-month interval. Changes in the overall number of hospitalizations because of autism and Crohn's disease were also checked throughout the study period. Of the 535 544 immunized children, 199 were hospitalized with encephalitis, 161 with aseptic meningitis, and 352 with autistic disorders. In nine children with encephalitis and 10 with meningitis, the disease developed within 3 months of immunization, revealing no increased occurrence within this designated risk period. Furthermore, in eight of nine cases of encephalitis, a very short interval of 2 days or an interval exceeding 1 month between immunization and hospitalization makes an association with immunization unlikely. As with encephalitis, an association between immunization and meningitis occurring on day 2 or over 1 month after immunization is unlikely. No clustering of hospitalization for autism has been detected after immunization; none of the autistic children went into hospital because of Crohn's disease.

A study on MMR immunization and autism has been carried out in Denmark in all 537 303 children born in Denmark from 1991 to 1998. Using national registry data on autistic disorders, the investigators found no association between MMR immunization and a subsequent diagnosis of autism (RR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.68, 1.24) or a related disorder (RR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.65, 1.07). This national cohort study obviated the problems of selection bias and misclassification bias (48C).

In a case-control study of age at first MMR immunization in children with autism (n = 624) and children without (n = 1824), including children with regression in development, the overall distribution of ages at MMR immunization among children with autism was similar to that of matched control children (49C). Most of the cases (71%) and control children (68%) were immunized at 12–17 months of age. Similar proportions of case and control children had been immunized before 18 or before 24 months of age. There were no significant associations for either of these age cutoffs in specific case subgroups, including those with evidence of developmental regression.

One of the major reasons that measles occurred among bone marrow transplant recipients during an outbreak of measles in Brazil was that they had not been immunized. In Brazil, a 2-year interval between bone marrow transplantation and measles immunization was recommended. Following a study in 79 patients the investigators concluded that MMR immunization between 12 and 24 months after bone marrow transplantation is safe and will therefore be recommended at 15 months after transplantation. However, because the serocon-version rate to measles is only 46% (rubella 91%), serology should be performed after immunization to confirm protection (50c).",mainstream,M091ac,vaccine.autism
906,"As the Children’s Health Defense eBook, Conflicts of Interest Undermine Children’s Health, tries to make clear, the passage of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) in 1986 was a watershed event that emboldened vaccine manufacturers and their public- and private-sector accomplices—notably the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)—to systematically hide the serious damage caused by vaccines. In addition to making a mockery of pre-licensing safety testing and post-marketing surveillance, these entities have regularly manipulated (or destroyed) data to exaggerate both the benefits and effectiveness of vaccination. Manufacturers have also used their money and power to subordinate the mainstream media, medical journals and front groups, making it possible to publish and broadcast deceptive studies that whitewash questions inconvenient to the financial bottom line.

From multiple standpoints—not least of which is children’s dismal state of health—the status quo is untenable. Three of the most urgent steps to be taken include repealing the NCVIA, eliminating vaccine mandates (making both childhood and adult vaccination voluntary) and addressing conflicts of interest by establishing a fully transparent and independent vaccine safety commission.

The NCVIA has been an unmitigated disaster. As New York University law professor Mary Holland has written, the Act’s passage has allowed the government and vaccine manufacturers to ride roughshod over three important legal protections:
• Free and informed consent to an invasive medical procedure
• Accurate and complete information about vaccine ingredients and possible side effects
• The right to sue manufacturers and medical practitioners directly in the event of injury.

According to Holland, the absence of these legal protections for vaccination is “striking” compared to “almost all other medical interventions.”

The legal protections are interrelated. For example, an individual cannot exercise truly informed consent unless he or she has access to full and unbiased information. Recognizing this, one provision of the NCVIA was a mandate for the CDC to develop (and health care providers to distribute) patient education materials about vaccine risks and benefits. However, not only has the CDC repeatedly dumbed down the materials in a variety of ways, but research suggests that many doctors do not comply with the legal requirement to hand out (much less discuss) them. Instead, providers and the media continue to blandly assure the public that vaccine injuries are a “one in a million” event, never mentioning that 99% of vaccine injuries go unreported. Under the circumstances, no meaningful assessment of vaccine risks is possible.

Research shows that by eliminating consumers’ ability to sue, the NCVIA has had a tangibly negative effect on vaccine safety. After an extensive analysis of nationwide and state-level U.S. data, a researcher reported in 2017 that vaccines licensed after NCVIA’s passage were associated with “a significantly higher incidence of adverse events” compared to vaccines licensed prior to the law’s passage. The researcher concluded that “product safety deteriorates when consumers are no longer able to sue manufacturers.” Repealing the NCVIA and reinstating product liability would not solve all of the ethical problems that permeate the pharmaceutical industry’s business culture, but it could curtail the “free-for-all” environment that has prevailed since 1986 and might incentivize manufacturers to treat vaccines in the same way as drugs and put safety on somewhat of a more even footing with profits….",conspiracy,C00c7e,pharmaceutical.industry; vaccine

382,"A Reuters/Ipsos poll published Thursday has revealed that a quarter of Americans are not interested in taking a coronavirus vaccine.

The poll founds that 14% were not interested at all, and 10% were not very interested in the vaccine.

However, while that 24% dismissed the idea, two thirds, 66%, said they are either “very” or “somewhat” interested in taking a vaccine when it is produced.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said “It’s a little lower than I thought it would be with all the attention to COVID-19,” adding “I would have expected somewhere around 75 percent.”

The Reuters report notes that health experts believe “at least 70% of Americans would need to be immune through a vaccine or prior infection to achieve what is known as “herd immunity,” when enough people are resistant to an infectious disease to prevent its spread.”

Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine noted that “It’s not surprising a significant percentage of Americans are not going to take the vaccine because of the terrible messaging we’ve had, the absence of a communication plan around the vaccine and this very aggressive anti-vaccine movement.”

The poll also found that 36% of respondents would be less willing to take a vaccine if President Trump said it was safe, with just 14% said they would be interested.

A week ago, Trump announced “Operation Warp Speed,” to fast-track the development and distribution of a coronavirus vaccine by January 2021, tapping experts and resources in science, medicine, the military, and the private sector.

Trump has said that the military will be deployed to distribute the vaccine, but has suggested that it will remain voluntary, noting that it will be for those “who want to get it,” and “Not everyone is going to want to get it.”

700,"Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, there has been a sudden and massive divergence in macroeconomic projections. For example, in early February, the spread among economic growth forecasts for Q2 in the U.S. was 3.5 percentage points according to FocusEconomics data. By April 29, the most optimistic forecast among the 28 institutions in our weekly coronavirus survey saw the U.S. economy contracting 8.2%. The most pessimistic projected a huge 65.0% contraction — a spread of 56.8 percentage points — with an average of -31.4%. There are three reasons for the divergence: First, the economic impact and speed of policy changes have never been higher. Second, the pandemic is undermining the reliability of economic data. Finally, economic forecasters are having to delve into the unfamiliar world of epidemiology.

The coronavirus pandemic has introduced extreme uncertainty into nearly every aspect of society. Will health care systems hold up? Will scientists develop a vaccine? Are essential workers safe? When can regular employees go back to the office? The answers to these questions — when there are answers — seem to change daily. And with each change the stock market (and our hopes) rises or falls.

Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, we’ve seen pervasive uncertainty manifest in a sudden and massive divergence in macroeconomic projections. For example, in early February, the spread among economic growth forecasts for Q2 in the U.S. was 3.5 percentage points according to FocusEconomics data. By April 29, the most optimistic forecast among the 28 institutions in our weekly coronavirus survey saw the U.S. economy contracting 8.2%. The most pessimistic projected a huge 65.0% contraction — a spread of 56.8 percentage points — with an average of -31.4%. While most institutions expected a rebound in Q3, some saw further declines. And in Q4, although all economists projected growth of some form, forecasts ranged from a minimum of +1.1% and a maximum of +70.0%. The spreads observed in recent weeks are by far the widest recorded since we started covering the U.S. a decade ago.

Looking at countries with a longer time horizon, the current forecast spread among analysts is far larger than at any point during the past 20 years, and significantly above that seen during the height of the financial crisis — the last period of extreme, prolonged global uncertainty. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, both Brazil and Mexico saw the spread for annual GDP forecasts widen to close to six percentage points, before returning to under three for most of the 2010s. The percentage point spread is now well over seven percentage points.

Why So Much Divergence?

The short answer to why there is so much divergence is because no one knows for sure what is going to happen. Digging deeper, three key factors are causing forecasters particular difficulties.

First, the economic impact and speed of policy changes have never been higher. In normal times, most governments can be relied on to at least attempt to encourage economic growth and preserve employment. Today, however, they are deliberately provoking recessions to save lives, and containment measures are crushing domestic activity. Simply miscalculating the end date of a nationwide lockdown by a couple of weeks throws annual GDP forecasts completely off-kilter. Moreover, bills which generally endure months of parliamentary ping-pong are being rushed through legislatures in days as governments and central banks race to respond to the rapid advance of the virus. Many governments have adopted emergency powers allowing them to rule by decree. What’s more, the fiscal and monetary stimulus being announced to palliate the downturn dwarfs that seen during the financial crisis. For economic forecasters, keeping up with the constant flurry of measures and correctly incorporating them into models poses challenges.

Second, the pandemic is undermining the reliability of economic data — the bedrock of any good macroeconomic model. In particular, survey-based data of businesses and households is suffering as lockdown measures reduce response rates, amplifying sampling error. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data for March, for instance, saw establishments’ and households’ response rates fall by nine and 10 percentage points respectively relative to their recent average.

Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, explained the problem this way: “If you are filling in survey forms in a lockdown, you are likely to be an unusual person, and possibly not representative. Sentiment affects answers to surveys. Data, like consumer price inflation, includes restaurant prices, but restaurants are closed. What happens when you survey something that is not there? Online spending is likely to have increased in lockdowns. Online spending may stay higher after the lockdowns end. It may not be properly captured in official data.”

The third reason the models are diverging so much is because economic forecasters are having to delve into the unfamiliar world of epidemiology to better understand the likely evolution of the coronavirus outbreak in each country. However, this is a challenge even for health experts. Predicting the scope and effectiveness of future public health interventions, or how health care systems will respond under pressure, is tough — particularly for countries at early stages of their epidemics. There is no firm timeline for the arrival of game-changing treatments or vaccines, or clarity over the likelihood or severity of a second wave of cases.

The divergence in economic forecasts should narrow somewhat going forward. Greater clarity will emerge on the effectiveness of recent stimulus, and any further fiscal or monetary measures will likely be more modest in scope. The gradual lifting of lockdowns will facilitate the collection of economic data. Our knowledge of the virus and its spread will improve. But a return to pre-virus levels of economic uncertainty will have to wait until a lasting solution to the pandemic — likely in the form of a vaccine — is found.

While the coronavirus pandemic poses a unique challenge to macroeconomic forecasters, the profession has faced similarly profound shocks in the past and emerged fortified. The global financial crisis of 2008 caught most economists napping. But the insights gained in areas such as the economics of financial contagion and the impact of unconventional monetary measures have improved the quality of today’s forecasting models. In the same way, Covid-19 will shine new light on areas such as behavioral economics — how consumer spending is affected by fear of contagion for instance — and the economic effects of radical fiscal policy. The knowledge gained could make the uncertainty of future economic crises, whenever and however they come, that bit less extreme.",mainstream,M0a841,vaccine; vaccine.covid

We’re also perilously far behind. The number of new cases appearing each day is swinging wildly, from 13,000 on May 19 to 24,000 the next day, even though much of the country remains locked down. And those are just the cases we know about. Until the U.S. does a far better job of quickly figuring out who is infected, it simply won’t be possible to keep up with tracing.

Marc Lipsitch, director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard University's School of Public Health, is pessimistic. Even if 80 percent of the country managed to trace cases effectively—“which would be miraculous,” he said—the remaining 20 percent would be a constant source of new infections. New research, not yet peer reviewed, suggests tracing would have to catch at least half of all new cases to reduce transmission even 10 percent. “My view is it’s probably not going to work,” Lipsitch said. “But given the lack of alternatives, we have to try—and hopefully demonstrate that I’m wrong.”

Tracing techniques have been honed over decades

Technology may help some this time around. Apple and Google and a half dozen other companies are developing cellphone applications that use GPS or Bluetooth technology. These apps can alert users that they were recently near an infectious person or allow them to retrace their steps to see if they crossed paths with a carrier. But most experts insist technology will merely support, not supplant, human tracing. And it may never be as effective in the U.S. as it has been in other countries.

For starters, tech solutions are valuable only if widely adopted, and polls show Americans are skeptical and worry that apps could infringe on data privacy. The U.S. also has so many cases that it can’t rely on weak crowdsourcing with limited penetration to find them all. Meanwhile, in much of Asia, previous viral outbreaks bred enough comfort and respect for tracing that there is less need for the handholding provided by human tracers. In a few countries, notably China, authoritarian governments also leave citizens little choice but to participate.",mainstream,M084a3,vaccine.covid

An experimental coronavirus vaccine from Oxford University appears to be effective at preventing COVID-19, according to findings from a small study in six monkeys.

Oxford scientists posted the preliminary findings on the vaccine on the preprint server bioRxiv early Thursday.

Preprints are studies that have not undergone a rigorous peer-review process required for publication in medical or scientific journals. But many scientists have been releasing results to the public in the form of preprints because of the high level of interest surrounding potential treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

The new report from Oxford University is based on the vaccination of six rhesus macaques. These monkeys are considered to be good proxies for how drugs could work in people because they share a majority of their genes with humans.

The animals were given half of the dose currently being tested in human. Those trials began on April 24 and include about 1,110 people.

Researchers reported at least some of the monkeys developed antibodies to the virus within 14 days of being vaccinated, and all of the vaccinated animals had evidence of antibodies within 28 days.

The vaccine trial in question was not illegal, though it was later halted and has been the source of controversy in India.

The claims refer to a Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine study conducted by the U.S. non-profit organization Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). The study, which was financed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, was cancelled in 2010 after local media reported the death of seven girls taking part ( here , here ).

The study was cancelled in 2010 following local media reports highlighting the death of seven girls taking part. Science Magazine reported that investigations carried out by a committee designated by the Indian Government later determined the deaths were unrelated to the vaccine demonstration:

“Five were evidently unrelated to the vaccine: One girl drowned in a quarry; another died from a snake bite; two committed suicide by ingesting pesticides; and one died from complications of malaria. The causes of death for the other two girls were less certain: one possibly from pyrexia, or high fever, and a second from a suspected cerebral hemorrhage.” ( here )

On August 29, 2013 the Indian Parliament’s Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare reported the vaccination trial by PATH committed several irregularities, including a “gross violation of the consent and legal requirement of consent” ( see page 14 here ).

843,"hen Chloe Fu, 24, went for a run on Monday evening, the streets of Stockholm were filled with people drinking on restaurant patios, enjoying the first warm day of sunshine after a long winter.

“When you walk around, there is a total and utter absence of panic,” Fu says, who moved to Sweden from the United States last year. “The streets are just as busy as they would have been last spring.”

As many public spaces throughout Europe empty out—with citizens only leaving home for essential groceries or medication—life in Sweden is carrying on, mostly as usual. Children walk to school while adults meet up for dinner at their local bar. Only the vulnerable have been advised to isolate and some are working from home. Yet in Sweden, where there are 9,141 confirmed cases and 793 people have died, experts worry weaker measures may be leading to a more severe outbreak in the country of just 10 million citizens.

Sweden has a relatively high case fatality rate: as of April 8, 7.68% of the Swedes who have tested positive for COVID-19 have died of the virus. Neighboring countries, like Norway and Denmark, have case fatality rates of 1.46% and 3.85% respectively. (The U.S. case fatality rate is 3.21%.) While Sweden’s elevated case fatality rate could be a result of its low testing rates compared to its neighbors, experts say Sweden’s laissez-faire approach could also be to blame.

The Swedish government continues to advocate for relaxed measures. The Swedish Public Health Agency cautions citizens to cover their mouths when they cough or sneeze and wash hands regularly but does not call for lockdown measures. On March 11, the government cut down the size of permitted gatherings to 500, and only lowered that down to 50 on March 29. Other countries, like Germany and Australia, have prohibited gathering in groups larger than two. On Monday, Sweden declared that domestic flights would continue running, despite the risks domestic travel poses for spreading the disease.

Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s chief epidemiologist overseeing the government’s response to COVID-19 has said the government should allow the virus to spread slowly through the population, an approach initially employed by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands before both countries rapidly changed strategy amid mounting evidence that this approach would still overburden health care systems. Tegnell told Swedish TV on April 5 that COVID-19 could be stopped by “herd immunity or a combination of immunity and vaccination.” (A vaccine for COVID-19 is likely at least 14 months away.)

But many experts throughout Sweden say the current strategy is dangerous.

“Herd immunity doesn’t make sense because we don’t know whether or not you can become immune,” says Nele Brusselaers, an associate professor of clinical epidemiology. She added, “this is a virus that can kill anybody.”

Keep up to date with our daily coronavirus newsletter by clicking here.

At the end of March, 2,300 doctors, scientists and academics signed an open letter to the government calling for stricter measures.

“We think there is no scientific evidence for their strategy,” says Cecilia Söderberg-Nauclér, an expert in microbial pathogenesis who signed the letter. She says the government has been reluctant to share its data with scientists, leading her to believe that the government’s strategy is “not based on evidence.”

Carina King, an infectious diseases epidemiologist, agrees that the government’s lack of transparency makes it “really hard to give proper scientific thoughts on their approach because they haven’t released their science.” She added that the government has made no concrete efforts to test, contact trace and quarantine—as South Korea did—which is standard protocol to stop localized spread at the beginning of an outbreak.

Nevertheless, she says Sweden could be a rare case where a nationwide lockdown may not be necessary. “Sweden is unique,” she says. “It doesn’t have many intergenerational households. It is a country where you could have a mixed approach.”

Though interpersonal distance is valued in Swedish culture and 40% of Swedish households are single-person households without children, other experts say that COVID-19 can still spread rapidly and widely in these conditions. Sweden has the second lowest number of critical care beds in Europe after Portugal, with only 5 beds for every 100,000 inhabitants. The healthcare system would likely be unable to handle a severe COVID-19 outbreak.

Currently, experts say the Swedish government is not following the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidelines, which advise countries with COVID-19 outbreaks to contact trace where possible and to adopt strict self-isolation measures. “I’m surprised and frustrated that they still have not taken any action or listened to the advice of organizations like WHO,” says Brusselaers. “They disregard any prediction model that has been published by experts in the field and they don’t even give a defense.”

A head doctor at a major hospital in Sweden says the current approach will “probably end in a historical massacre.” He says healthcare workers at his hospital who have tested positive for the virus but are asymptomatic have been advised to continue working. He asked to remain anonymous because “it is frowned upon to speak of the epidemic or to go against the official vision” but said he felt a need to speak out from an “ethical and medical point of view.”

The Swedish legislature will meet this week to discuss whether tougher measures restricting business and travel should be implemented. Söderberg-Nauclér says it’s already too late to prevent chaos in Stockholm but that preventative lockdown measures could still be taken throughout other parts of the country.

“If they are right and we are wrong, I will open a bottle of champagne,” Söderberg-Nauclér says. She notes that, based on the modeling she’s seen, the healthcare system in Sweden will collapse if stricter measures are not adopted immediately. “But I will not give up the fight until the government shows us evidence for their strategy.”

While experts may be taking issue with the government’s approach, many Swedes seem to be in favor of it. Opinion polls show that citizens trust the Public Health Authority, with 48% saying they have very high or high confidence in the institution. “It’s rare for Swedish society to loudly disapprove of the government,” says Fu. “Even though people are concerned about losing loved ones, they also trust that the government is doing the right thing.”

And Swedes have above-average confidence in their politicians, who in turn, trust citizens to follow their advice. “In Sweden, the approach has always been to make suggestions and let the public decide,” says Johan Erik Lallerstedt, a 23-year-old filmmaker living in Stockholm. “Whatever guidelines the government may give are just that: suggestions. Nothing is enforced.”

But Söderberg-Nauclér believes this outbreak could bring an end to a long history of public trust in government. “If you put people’s lives at risk in democratic society and then you do not help them, how will society trust politicians?” she says. “I don’t want to live in a society that treats people like this.”

Over a dozen experimental vaccines are being trialled around the world. None of them has yet successfully completed a late-stage ""Phase 3"" test to determine efficacy in shielding healthy people from the virus, which has killed over 4,70,000 people around the world.

Such trials involve thousands of participants and normally take place in countries where the virus is widespread, so that the vaccine can be observed in a real-life environment.

However, China, the origin of the global pandemic, reported fewer than 10 new local cases a day on average last month, and its researchers are now looking abroad.

CNBG announced the move in a Weibo social media post, without naming the vaccine to be tested in the UAE.

Units of CNBG, an affiliate of the state-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), have developed two potential vaccines, which have together been given to over 2,000 people in previous tests in China.

Other Chinese companies seeking to trial vaccines overseas include Clover Biopharmaceuticals, whose shots have been given to participants in Australia in an early study, and Sinovac Biotech, which is expected to begin a Phase 3 trial in Brazil with 9,000 volunteers.",mainstream,M09c43,coronavirus; covid.19; vaccine
1151,"Washington benefits from new SARS unsettling major competitors. Prior to the advent of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, it was believed that the so-called “first package” of the US-China trade agreement, which was signed on behalf of the Celestial Empire by Vice Premier of the State Council of the PRC Liu He, is a tactical move, thanks to which China will get a respite.

And then there is the presidential election in the USA, and it is still unknown whether Donald Trump will be able to gain a foothold in the Oval Office for a second term … But, it seems, a malicious virus that has matured either in the stomachs of bats, or in a snake’s gut, has confused all the cards to a friend Xi Jinping.

Against the background of alarming reports from the Chinese province of Hubei (when this material was being prepared, more than 4.5 thousand people fell ill with pneumonia, and 106 died, and these are not final numbers. – Auth.) Copper and iron ore prices collapsed.

At the same time, the Fitch rating agency cautiously reports that the spread of coronavirus will first of all have a negative impact on the economies of Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore, since in these countries the most vulnerable regions to the epidemics are tourism and the service sector. The statement is indisputable – everyone will get it, and yet China, presumably, is more than others, since it is the Chinese economy that is the main consumer of both metals and energy, and tourism with a service sector is not the last source of replenishment of the treasury. And since the prices of these goods went down, the Chinese economy also caught the “virus”. And it is easier to negotiate with a “sick” client, which is well known even without Trump.

It is noteworthy that 2019-nCoV got to the American technological giant Apple, whose production facilities are located just 500 kilometers from the “home” of the coronavirus – the Wuhan metropolis. And now, according to the Nikkei Asian Review, the production of popular iPhone smartphones is in jeopardy. Starbucks also found itself in a difficult situation, which, due to quarantine, had to close a large half of its four thousand coffee houses operating in China (by the way, this is the second largest market after the United States). But at the same time, the Americans for some reason do not look like such victims of the epidemic, especially Apple, whose leadership at the very beginning of the trade and economic confrontation with China advised to evacuate production facilities in the United States.

… It seems as if President Trump saw everything in advance, like Wolf Messing or old Wang. However, both Apple and Starbucks were really out of luck. You can’t say the same about the American political establishment, which is making titanic efforts to bring to its knees the “presumptuous China.” And why should these efforts necessarily be of an economic nature? ..

The main question is – who benefits from another SARS unsettling a competitor? If we apply the well-known trick highly likely, unceremoniously used by British ex-prime minister Theresa May to hang the so-called Skripals poisoning in Russia, then the answer is obvious: the coronavirus epidemic 2019-nCoV, which hit China, is highly likely on the hand of the United States. And the worse for Beijing, the better for Washington. Moreover, the outlook for the epidemic is not yet encouraging. For example, some experts argue that if the spread of 2019-nCoV cannot be stopped, up to 250 million Chinese can become victims of the virus, which is almost two in number in Russia.

By the way, about the prospects. The Cepi Global Vaccine Coalition has reportedly invested a total of $ 12.5 million in three projects, in which researchers are ready to expeditiously develop the 2019-nCoV vaccine.

Scientists from the University of Queensland, as well as two American biotechnology companies Inovio and Moderna, participate in the work. The American National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is also involved. And it seems that microbiologists from Hong Kong have already developed a vaccine against the new coronavirus, as Professor of Hong Kong University Ewan Kwok-Jung hastened to inform the newspaper South China Morning Post. But her research, he claims, could take more than a year. German Shipulin, the deputy director of the Center for Strategic Planning of the Ministry of Health of Russia, does not promise an imminent victory over 2019-nCoV. So the hands of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV can be considered as yet untied, and there are suspicions that the United States may be involved in this epidemic. In the Russian media, this assumption has already been made.

US operations as part of a biological warfare against the entire planet As a result of the dengue epidemic in Cuba from 1978-1981, up to 500 thousand people were affected. Fidel Castro said this was the result of an American biological attack. Washington did not confirm or refute the allegations of the Cuban leader. Pentagon bio laboratories exist in 25 countries around the world. They are funded by the Military Threat Reduction Agency under a $ 2.1 billion military program. The joint biological interaction program includes laboratories located in the countries of the former Soviet Union, such as Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, as well as in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa. Washington did not confirm or refute this data. By the location of these biological laboratories, we can confidently indicate the four countries and territories against which the American biological threats are now directed, these are Russia, Iran, China and the countries of Central and West Africa. Washington did not confirm or refute this data. The American company CH2M Hill, under contracts for the Pentagon bio labs in Georgia, Uganda, Tanzania, Iraq, Afghanistan, Southeast Asia, was funded in the amount of $ 341.5 million. Of this amount, almost half ($ 161.1 million) was allocated for research in Lugar Center in Tbilisi. Washington did not confirm or refute this data. Its subcontractor, the private company Battelle, has been operating in the Pentagon bio labs in Afghanistan, Armenia, Georgia, Uganda, Tanzania, Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam. Battelle conducts research, development, testing and assessment of the use of both highly toxic chemicals and highly pathogenic biological agents for a wide range of US government agencies. The company has entered into federal contracts totaling $ 2 billion and ranks 23rd in the list of 100 best US state contractors. Washington did not confirm or refute this data. The Pentagon has a very long history of using insects as carriers of disease. According to a partially declassified US Army report of 1981, American scientists conducted a series of experiments on insects. These operations were part of the US Entomological War as part of a biological weapons program. Washington did not confirm or refute this data. The report reported two scenarios: 16 simultaneous attacks on the city by A. Aegypti mosquitoes infected with yellow fever, as well as Tularemia aerosol attack, and assessed their effectiveness in cash and human losses. The results were very cynical. Pentagon specialists managed to “kill” 625 thousand people at a cost of $ 0.29 per unit. Washington did not confirm or refute this data. Operation Big Itch: Field trials were conducted to determine the coverage and survivability of tropical rat fleas Xenopsylla cheopis for use as a disease carrier in biological warfare. Washington did not confirm or refute this data. Operation Big Buzz: 1 million A. Aegypti mosquitoes were raised. One third of them were placed in ammunition, dropped from aircraft and scattered on the ground. Mosquitoes survived in the air and actively sought human blood. Washington did not confirm or refute this data. Operations on military experiments with tropical mosquitoes and ticks in Georgia. Such species of mosquitoes and fleas (which were studied in the past as part of the US Entomological War Program) were imported into Georgia and tested at the Lugar Center. Washington did not confirm or refute this data. Anthrax is one of the biological agents in the arsenal of the US Army, not only in the past. Despite Pentagon claims that this program is only defensive, there are facts to the contrary. In 2016, at the Lugar Center, American scientists conducted a study “Genome Sequence of the Soviet / Russian Bacillus anthracis Vaccine Strain 55-VNIIVViM” (Genome Sequence of the Soviet / Russian Anthracite Cancer Vaccine in Russia), which was funded by the US Agency’s Biological Weapons Sharing Program Threat Reduction (DTRA) in Tbilisi, and implemented by Metabiota. Washington did not confirm or refute this data. Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by the tick-borne virus Nairovirus (Nairovirus). The disease was first described in Crimea in 1944 and was called Crimean hemorrhagic fever. Later, it caused an epidemic in the Congo in 1969. In 2014, 34 people were infected with the CCHF, including a 4-year-old child, three of whom died. Pentagon biologists are currently studying the virus in Georgia as part of the DTRA project, Epidemiology of febrile illnesses caused by Dengue viruses and other Arboviruses in Georgia. The project included trials on patients with fever symptoms and collection of ticks as possible distributors of CCHV for laboratory analysis. Washington did not confirm or refute this data. Similar CCHV outbreaks occurred in Afghanistan, where 3 Pentagon bio-laboratories are present. As of December 2017, 237 cases of CCHV were reported in this country, 41 of which were fatal. Washington did not confirm or refute this data. Bats are also being studied as a carrier of various diseases at the Lugar Center, which scientists say are carriers of the Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and other deadly diseases. As of June 2017, 1980 cases were recorded with 699 deaths in 19 countries around the world caused by MERS-CoV. This virus is designed and manufactured in the USA. Washington did not confirm or refute this data. Another weapon of bioterrorism is, according to a 1981 US Army report, Tularemia, or Rabbit Fever, developed in the USA. New tularemia carriers, such as ticks and rodents, are currently being developed. DTRA has launched a number of projects on Tularemia and in Georgia at the Lugar Center. Highly pathogenic agents (EDP) can be used for military purposes. Washington did not confirm or refute this data. Ukraine itself does not have control over military biological laboratories on its territory. Under the 2005 Agreement between the US Department of Defense and the Department of Health of Ukraine, the Ukrainian government is prohibited from publicly disclosing confidential information about the US program. Ukraine is also required to transfer all dangerous pathogens to the US Department of Defense for biological research. Under this Agreement, the Pentagon was granted access to many state secrets of Ukraine. Washington did not confirm or refute this data. The Pentagon has invested at least $ 65 million in gene editing research. The U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has provided seven research teams to develop tools for altering the genome of insects, rodents, and bacteria through the DARPA Safe Gene program using new CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.

The worst biological weapon that may have already been used and possibly used in Russia is, again, perhaps used against the “enemy” of the USA – China. Until recently, ethnic biological weapons (biogenetic weapons) were theoretical weapons, the purpose of which is, first of all, to harm people of certain ethnic groups or genotypes (Russians, Chinese, etc.). Although officially the research and development of ethnic bio-weapons has never been publicly confirmed, documents show that the United States collects biological materials from certain ethnic groups – Russians and Chinese. American National Socialism in its purest form.

US Air Force specifically collects samples of Russian DNA and synovial tissue, which causes concern in Moscow about a hidden American program for the use of biological weapons.

Senator Franz Klintsevich commented on the words of President Vladimir Putin on the purposeful collection of Russian biomaterial: “In the West, everything is done very scrupulously and verified to the smallest detail: if we use biological weapons, then surely … The relevant services in the West should know that we are aware of their interest. Let those who are engaged in this work on the territory of the Russian Federation not be offended. ”

And it cannot be said that such suspicions have no reason. As you know, the United States ratified the Geneva Protocol and the Biological Weapons Convention back in 1975. But biological games overseas have not stopped, and not only in the national territory. Already after the collapse of the USSR, American biological laboratories appeared, which is precisely established in Georgia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. Where else – except that the State Department knows that it claims to be absolutely peaceful organizations involved in the development of medicines. But if they are so peaceful, then why, one wonders, did the Americans build them not at home, but at the other end of the world?

Comments, as they say, are unnecessary. Not so long ago, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation analyzed documents on the activities of the so-called “health center” that the Americans built in Georgia, and came to the conclusion: in fact, this is a “death factory”, which killed 73 people who were used by overseas biologists as experimental rabbits. But the fact of the matter is that American bio-laboratories are scattered not only around Russia, but also around the world, where America has its own interests.

And another question, where did the 2019-nCoV coronavirus originate – in a bat or in some American “health center”? Where is it more highly likely?

Here’s a good reason to get a flu shot every single year: people who got a new vaccination every flu season were less likely to die or end up in the hospital with severe flu, a new study shows.

A look at people taken to the hospital with influenza showed that those who had been vaccinated repeatedly did better than those who had only been vaccinated in the current year.

The study of people over 65 — who are most likely to die from influenza — showed that repeated vaccination was twice as good at preventing the most severe complications of flu.

“The prevention of severe and fatal infection caused by influenza was observed mainly in patients who were vaccinated in both the current and previous seasons,” Dr. Itziar Casado and Dr. Jesús Castilla of the Institute for Public Health in Pamplona, Spain, wrote in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.

""Repeated vaccination for influenza was highly effective in preventing severe and fatal infection caused by influenza in older adults,"" they added.

This makes sense to David Topham, a microbiologist and immunologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center, who was not involved in the research.

“We probably only get exposed to influenza, the virus, every three to five years on average,” Topham told NBC News.

Related: Most kids who died of flu weren't vaccinated

“That’s plenty of time for your immunity to wane. Getting the vaccine every year boosts your immunity.”

And repeated vaccination may cause broader immunity, both Topham and the researchers said. Vaccines stimulate both the production of antibodies and cells called T-cells to fight germs. Repeated vaccination might more effectively boost the action of T-cells.

It’s a reassuring finding. A couple of small studies had suggested that getting the flu vaccine every year might increase some people’s risk of catching flu, even though it was hard to explain why that might happen. Topham said he did not think the evidence shows repeated vaccines are harmful.

“I think it might not be the case for most people,” he said. “It was a very slight effect.” And, he said, most studies had shown the opposite — that getting a flu vaccine every year prevents infection better than getting vaccinated once in a while.

A separate study suggested that pregnant women who got a certain flu vaccine two years in a row were more likely to miscarry, although again researchers said this conflicted with most of the other research that has been done.

U.S. officials recommend that just about everybody over the age of 6 months should get a flu vaccine every single year. The flu strains circulating often mutate and the vaccines are updated in an attempt to keep up.

This year the flu season is off to a strong start, with hospitals in some states already reporting their emergency rooms are filling up. So far, 13 children have died from flu.

Even if the flu shot does not completely protect against infection, the research shows that it greatly lowers the rate of people who die or get severely ill from flu.

Flu kills between 2,000 to 56,000 Americans every year, depending on how bad the flu season is, and it puts 140,000 to 710,000 people into the hospital.

For the study in Spain, the team checked on 728 people 65 and older who were in the hospital with flu. Of these patients, 83 died.

Patients who had not been vaccinated at all were more likely to need intensive care — 16 percent of them did, compared to 6 percent of those who had been vaccinated. And 14 percent of those who died had not been vaccinated, compared to 6 percent who had been vaccinated.

The vaccine was 70 percent effective in preventing death.

“Vaccination that occurred only in the current season did not show significant protection against severe influenza,” the researchers noted. But repeated vaccination did.

It’s possible that people who get vaccines every year are healthier and more careful in other ways, Topham said. For instance, one study showed people who get flu vaccines are also less likely to have car accidents, he said.

“There is very little downside to getting your influenza vaccine,” said Topham. “I get my vaccine every year. Everyone in my family does.”",mainstream,M08482,vaccine
303,"Gaithersburg, Maryland-based biotech company Novavax announced yesterday it has begun enrolling its first human participants in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Preliminary immunogenicity (ability to provoke an immune response) and safety results from the Phase 1 portion of the trial are expected in July 2020. Novavax is hoping the proprietary nanoparticle technology and Matrix‑M adjuvant used in its promising flu vaccine, NanoFlu, will help create an effective novel coronavirus vaccine.

Novavax stock is up 17% today on the news and is up over 1000% year-to-date, but this isn't based on its progress alone. Remember Novavax is the same firm receiving $388 million in funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)﻿﻿. The Oslo-based foundation focuses on vaccine development and was founded by billionaire Bill Gates in 2017. ""Vaccines provide our best hope of permanently defeating this pandemic, so it is encouraging to see rapid progress being made in the development of Novavax’ vaccine candidate,"" said Dr. Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI, in the press release. CEPI has given much smaller amounts ranging from $1 million to $9 million to others working on coronavirus vaccines, including Inovio, Moderna and CureVac.

Today U.S. pharma giant Merck threw its hat into the ring with three initiatives to help end the pandemic. It has bought Vienna-based Themis Bioscience, which is developing a vaccine, and collaborating with non-profit IAVI and Ridgeback Bio on a vaccine and antiviral candidate, respectively. As of May 22, there are 10 COVID-19 vaccine candidates in clinical evaluation and 114 candidates in preclinical evaluation, according to WHO. The 10 in the clinical evaluation stage belong to:

Although we're still months, if not years, from a safe vaccine available to the general population, the Novavax news is contributing to the market surge today.

""That came on several fronts today. U.S. Memorial weekend saw the U.S. out in force enjoying their post lockdown freedoms. Japan in addition to announcing more billions in stimulus, signaled that the final lockdowns over their largest cities are ending.

363,"Florida Rep. urges Congress to address claim that MMR vaccine at an early age leads to higher incidence of autism

A Florida congressman went before the House earlier this week to again plead for an investigation into the CDC over allegations the agency destroyed documents proving a link between childhood autism and the MMR vaccine.

Two months after a similar speech, Rep. Bill Posey on Tuesday was at it again imploring Congress to investigate admissions made by former CDC researcher Dr. Bill Thompson, who claimed he and other CDC scientists destroyed documents showing a causal link between injections of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine at an early age and autism-like symptoms.

[ad]“…[I]t’s troubling to me that in a recent Senate hearing on childhood vaccinations, it was never mentioned that our government has paid out over three billion dollars through a vaccine injury compensation program for children that have been injured by vaccinations,” Posey pointed out.

In an in-depth video released last year, Thompson confessed to Dr. Brian Hooker that he and other scientists hid or omitted evidence that receiving the vaccine at an earlier age directly correlated with a higher risk or incidence of autism. Thompson also forwarded Hooker documents which were ordered destroyed, but which he managed to keep copies of.

“I believe it is my duty that the documents Dr. Thompson provided are not ignored,” Posey said, echoing sentiments made in his previous speech.

But that was only part of what Dr. Thompson’s team had covered up.

“The risk of autism from early MMR vaccination was seen in black children, black boys. Those boys for some reason are at very high risk,” the narrator of the video, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, says. “Consistent with the CDC’s own findings, the rate of autistic regression in black children is reported to be twice that in white children.”

While beginning his remarks stating he was “absolutely, resolutely pro-vaccine,” Posey urged Congress to launch an investigation into the grave allegations.

“Considering the nature of the whistleblower’s documents, as well as the involvement of the CDC, a hearing and a thorough investigation is warranted. So I ask Mr. Speaker, I beg, I implore my colleagues on the Appropriations committees to please, please take such action,” Posey stated.

• Research scientist: You can expect to see one in two children afflicted by 2025.

Is the world facing an explosion in the number of children with autism? A respected researcher believes it is already happening. During a controversial conference late last year in Groton, Massachusetts, Dr. Stephanie Seneff, a senior Massachusetts Institute of Technology research scientist, told stunned audience members, “At today’s rate, by 2025, one in two children will be autistic.”

As an expert in biology, Dr. Seneff has published 170-plus peer-reviewed articles over the course of her career.

As she spoke, Dr. Seneff exhibited even more courage by blaming the alarming rise in autism on genetically modified foods and the use of Roundup pesticide agents manufactured by Monsanto.

“Is there a toxic substance that is currently in our environment in step with increasing rates of autism that could explain this?” she asked. “The answer is yes, I’m quite sure that I’m right, and the answer is glyphosate.”

Glyphosate is the active ingredient in Monsanto’s Roundup weedkiller.

To verify Dr. Seneff’s claims about the possibility of such an exponential increase, this reporter contacted Dave Pantos, the executive director of the Autism Action Partnership.

“In 1990, one in 500 children was diagnosed with autism,” said Pantos. “According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report issued in 2013, that number rose to one in 68. Worse, for boys, the rate soars to one in 42.”

This reporter also spoke with Wendy Fournier, president of the National Autism Association, who clarified some of these statistics.

“The 2013 CDC study stating that one in every 68 children is diagnosed with autism was based on a study of children born in the year 2002,” said Ms. Fournier. “Their figures are very outdated. Nobody even knows the actual rate of autism in this country. We’re certain of one thing, though—the rate of those suffering from autism is rising.”

Obviously troubled by this trend, Ms. Fournier asked:, “What’s happening to children? Why are so many chronically ill? It’s not possible that a genetic epidemic could develop over the past two decades, so there have to be environmental factors. More than 2% of male children born in this country now develop autism.”

When the taboo topic of vaccines came up during AMERICAN FREE PRESS’s interview with Ms. Fournier, she didn’t hesitate in her response: “I put credence in every possibility, including vaccines and mercury. We know that vaccines cause autism. There’s no question about it because court cases have proven it. Also, some kids are genetically predisposed to toxins. What’s going on inside their bodies, and why is it making them vulnerable? We’ve now reached a point where a second generation of kids is being lost to this disorder.”

Although this subject generally gets ignored by mainstream media health experts, within the next two decades over 1.5 million of these children will age into adults with autism. Ms. Fournier realizes the dangers.

“This is a disaster,” she said. “What are we going to do with those at the lower end of the functioning spectrum, especially when their parents, the primary health providers, die or are unable to tend for them? These individuals will require around-the-clock attention for the rest of their lives. They can’t function, they’re minimally verbal and most are incapable of self-care.”

Even before this fateful day arrives, Ms. Fournier sees another, more immediate concern.

“One of the biggest medical issues being overlooked is co-occurrence problems,” she said. “Specifically, gastrointestinal [GI] difficulties are extremely common in children with autism. Really painful GI diseases cause chronic constipation or diarrhea, which then create behavioral problems because these children can’t adequately verbalize what’s affecting them. That’s why we so often see aggressive episodes or self-injury. These underlying medical issues aren’t being addressed or treated. A majority of families are still struggling to receive proper early diagnosis.”

Despite billions of dollars being spent by governmental agencies on various studies, Ms. Fournier views their efforts as misguided: “The Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee [IACC], founded under the National Institutes of Health, has failed us miserably. We’ve brought all this information to IACC, but they keep doing the wrong research. All of our requests made over many years have been ignored by the government’s national health agencies.”

115,"China Caught Shutting Down COVID-19 Research to ‘Control the Narrative’

China has been caught shutting down research into COVID-19 in an apparent attempt to ""control the narrative"" of the coronavirus pandemic, leading analysts have revealed.

The websites for two of China's leading universities recently published academic research about the origins of the coronavirus.

However, the studies were then deleted from both websites and scrubbed from the state-controlled Internet, according to a report.

In a possible bid to ""control the narrative"" surrounding the pandemic, the posts on the websites of the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) and Fudan University were erased from online caches, The Guardian reported.

Wuhan's university appears to have published and then deleted posts about academic research that needed to be approved by China’s ministry of science and technology before publication.

Posts originally published on April 9 by the school of information science and technology at Fudan University in Shanghai were also deleted in a similar apparent censorship effort.

“They are seeking to transform it from a massive disaster to one where the government did everything right and gave the rest of the world time to prepare,” Kevin Carrico, a senior research fellow of Chinese studies at Monash University, told The Guardian.

“There is a desire to a degree to deny realities that are staring at us in the face … that this is a massive pandemic that originated in a place that the Chinese government really should have cleaned up after SARS,” he added.

China’s science and technology ministry had announced on April 3 that academic researchers needed to report their coronavirus findings to officials within three days or be terminated.

The news outlet noted that China’s President Xi Jinping published an essay in March that included “tracing the origin of the virus” a national priority; the science and technology ministry referenced the essay shortly before the universities changed tunes.

On New Year’s Eve, China informed the World Health Organization of a “mysterious pneumonia outbreak” spreading through Wuhan, an industrial city of 11 million.

The government closed a seafood market at the center of the outbreak, moved all patients with the virus to a specially designated hospital and collected test samples to send to government laboratories.

Doctors were told to stay quiet; one who issued a warning online was punished.

He later died of the virus.

The Pentagon was said to have first learned about the new coronavirus in December from open-source reports emanating from China.

By early January, warnings about the virus had made their way into intelligence reports circulating around the government.

On Jan. 3, the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], Robert Redfield, received a call from his Chinese counterpart with an official warning.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, said he was alerted to the virus around the same time — and within two weeks was fearful it could bring about a global catastrophe.

Quickly, U.S. intelligence and public health officials started doubting China’s reported rates of infection and death toll.

They pressed China to allow in U.S. epidemiologists — both to assist the country in confronting the spread and to gain valuable insights that could help buy time for the U.S. response.

U.S. officials also pressed China to send samples of the virus to U.S. labs for study and for vaccine and test development.

That same day, the National Institutes of Health started working on a vaccine.

Ultimately, the U.S. was able to get China’s consent to send two people on the WHO team that traveled to China later in the month.

But by then precious weeks had been lost and the virus had raced across Asia and had started to escape the continent.",conspiracy,C004b5,vaccine.covid
638,"As the new school year has begun in Italy, parents no longer have to prove their children have been immunised – highlighting a clash of priorities, stoked by the new populist government.

In 2014, the Global Health Security Agenda had tapped Italy to lead world vaccination strategies.

But just four years later, the country has instead become the testing ground for anti-vaxxers, a movement growing across Europe and the US, and whose ideologies often share space on the political landscape with populist parties.

""Ten obligatory vaccinations are useless and in many cases dangerous, if not harmful,” Italy’s interior minister Matteo Salvini said, in the run up to the general election in March.

The measles epidemic in Europe as a whole is now at an eight-year high.

Mr Salvini, from the League party, and also the country’s deputy prime minister, shares something in common with other leading populists such as his European ally Marine Le Pen and US president Donald Trump. As part of their anti-establishment views, they are also choosing to target science.

The League and it’s coalition partner, the Five Star Movement, both stood with anti-vaxxer groups during the electoral campaign, promising to oppose the pre-existing law that made vaccines mandatory.

Soon after forming a government, the new health minister Giulia Grillo lifted the existing requirements by allowing parents to self-certify that their children have had the compulsory vaccinations, hitherto necessary for school admission.

But the parliament then said the requirement to provide proof of vaccinations would just be postponed until the 2019-2020 school year.

On one side, anti-vaxxers now accuse the League and the Five Star Movement of betrayal.

And on the other, confusion and legal uncertainty about compulsory vaccination has made the start of a new year much more difficult for vulnerable children, such as those with suppressed immune systems.

“I’m not ignorant,” says Anna Pettinarolli, from Genoa, the port city of northern Italy.

“I am a 35-year-old financial advisor who cares for her child. I believe that vaccines can cause damage, and that’s why I have been persuaded that parents have the right to choose if they should vaccinate their children or not.”

Ms Pettinarolli is a board member of Comilva, the Italian Movement for Freedom of Vaccination – one of the most well-known of all the Italian “free-choice”, or anti-vaccination associations.

“Our movement has grown over the last 30 years, and in particular in the last two years,"" she says. ""Do you want to know how many we are?

“Take a look at the vaccination rate. Look at the percentage of unvaccinated kids, and you’ll know how big our numbers are.”

These numbers are exactly why the World Health Organisation is so concerned about the rise of the anti-vaxxer movement in Italy; the country’s vaccination rate is far behind the goal.

To stop transmission of infections, 93-95 per cent of the population should be immunised, the herd immunity threshold. But in 2015, Italy’s paediatric measles vaccination rate was around 85 per cent for the first dose and 83 per cent for the second dose.

Scientists say that rather than becoming the leader in a global vaccination strategy, the country has become a black sheep.

When measles rates soared across Europe in 2017, the number of cases was three times higher than the year before. The two countries with the highest number of cases were Romania and Italy, with Italy accounting for 34 per cent of new cases. And in a sample of 5,000 of these cases, 89 per cent were unvaccinated people, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

In 2017 Beatrice Lorenzin, the former health minister, reacted to the fall in vaccinations by introducing a law that obliged children under the age of six to undergo 10 routine vaccines before enrolling in nurseries and pre-school.

But this mandatory vaccination policy appeared to fuel the no-vaxxers protest – and populist movements capitalised on it.

“What Italy is seeing is not a vague sentiment, or parents' response to some abstract concern about vaccines. It's the product of real people and specific facts,” says British journalist Brian Deer.

“This is principally the achievement of the disgraced former British doctor Andrew Wakefield, and a group of enablers who work with him, aiming to destabilise public confidence in vaccines.

“Embittered after he was caught falsifying vaccine research, he can do this because of the opportunities provided by social media.”

Mr Deer has become the unofficial debunker of the claims of anti-vaxxers. Twenty years ago, Wakefield published a study in The Lancet suggesting an association between the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine and autism and gastrointestinal diseases.

This paper is at the origins of parents’ growing scepticism towards vaccination – but Mr Deer showed that Wakefield had manipulated evidence and had a conflict of interest. As The Lancet itself had to admit, the study was “fake news” long before the term was popular.

Nevertheless, the fake news continues to be spread online, and public confidence in vaccinations continues to drop, and, as Mr Deer points out, the result is polarisation.

As was the case with Donald Trump – who tweeted and claimed that vaccines and autism are linked – at first Italian populists rode the wave of anti-vaccine sentiment in their election campaigns.

On the other side, scientists are trying to adapt and react.

Roberto Burioni, a professor of microbiology and virology at the Università Vita-Salute San Raffaele in Milan, is trying to use social networks to oppose no-vaxxers.

“The drop in vaccination rates made Italy comparable to Namibia or Ghana – that’s unacceptable,"" he said.

“Vaccines are necessary for public health: a high rate would mean that even children that can’t be vaccinated because of immunodepression can be protected from infections.

“I’ll continue explaining this whenever I can. This has cost me lots of threats and intimidations from fanatics, too.”",mainstream,M08d58,vaccine.autism
163,"Convincing vaccine skeptics to trust any future COVID-19 vaccine is going to be a tough job, even if there are mountains of data from clinical trials showing that it is safe and effective.

It’s going to be harder still if there is any reason for them to doubt the motives or the method behind the vaccine.

With that in mind, I can see two potential trouble spots with Operation Warp Speed, President Trump’s effort to leverage the full force of military, pharmaceutical industry and government resources to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 by the end of the year.

According to news reports, Trump has tapped Moncef Slaoui, a former executive with giant pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, along with a top Army general, Gustave F. Perna, to lead the effort.

Slaoui clearly has the pedigree and connections for such a job. He has a doctorate in molecular biology and immunology and ran the vaccine development program for GlaxoSmithKline, where he worked for 30 years. But he’s also a venture capitalist who sits on a number of pharmaceutical company boards, including those of two vaccine makers, SutroVax and Moderna.

Slaoui reportedly intends to step down from the boards to participate in Warp Speed, but that won’t erase a career spent deeply embedded in, and enriched by, the pharmaceutical industry. Putting him in charge of this effort gives ammunition to vaccine opponents to shoot holes in the public health campaign that will be needed to successfully immunize the public against the coronavirus.

One of the most durable myths trafficked by so-called anti-vaxxers is that vaccines are scams developed by greedy pharmaceutical companies, abetted by a corrupt government, to make money from substances that do more harm than good.

These claims have been repeatedly debunked, and studies show that vaccines are safe and effective. It’s also well documented that vaccines have saved untold numbers of humans from suffering and death from disease. Nevertheless, the fiction spread by anti-vaxxers continues to circulate and take hold among well-meaning, if gullible, people. The disinformation campaigns have done real harm, too, helping drive down rates of childhood immunizations and leading to the recent resurgence of measles in the U.S. and other countries.

And lord help us if anything goes wrong with the COVID-19 vaccine itself.

Although vaccines have been protecting people from deadly infectious diseases such as smallpox and influenza for centuries, they aren’t always benign and sometimes harm people they are intended to protect. The rush to develop a vaccine against polio in the 1950s had disastrous consequences. Some batches of the vaccine were found to be defective, but only after they had been rolled out in a mass immunization campaign. The bad batches caused 40,000 cases of polio, killing 10 children, leaving dozens more paralyzed and justifiably scaring the public about the safety of future vaccines.

That incident led to much tighter regulation for vaccines, but it should stand as a good reminder that expediting vaccine development comes with risks. And the facts that the White House is calling the effort Operation Warp Speed, not Operation Save Lives, and aiming to produce 100 million doses by November suggest that the motivation is meeting an artificial deadline rather than developing a safe way to protect the public against the coronavirus.",mainstream,M098c2,vaccine.covid

762,"Most Americans think vaccines are beneficial for health, and that children should be required to get them, according to a new poll.

The poll, from Pew Research Center, found 82 percent of U.S. adults say healthy children should be required to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine in order to attend school, while just 17 percent say parents should be able to decide not to vaccine their kids.

In addition, nearly three-quarters of respondents (73 percent) rated the health benefits of the MMR vaccine as ""high"" or ""very high,"" while just 7 percent rated the benefits as ""low."" Overall, 88 percent of Americans said the benefits of the MMR vaccine outweigh the risks, the poll found. [Just How Safe Are Vaccines? Here Are the Numbers]

Still, parents with young children were slightly more concerned about the safety of the MMR vaccine. The poll found that about 43 percent of parents with children ages 0 to 4 years rated the risks of the MMR vaccine as ""medium"" or ""high,"" compared with 29 percent of parents with no children under 18.

Some reports have found that people in more affluent communities are less likely to vaccinate their children, which has led to speculation that people with higher incomes are more concerned about vaccine safety, Pew said. But the new poll found people with higher incomes tended to have a positive view of vaccines — 97 percent of those with a family income of $100,000 a year or more said that the benefits of the MMR vaccine outweigh the risks, and 78 percent rated the risks of the vaccine as low.

Among those with a family income of less than $30,000 a year, 60 percent rated the risks of the MMR vaccine as low, and 79 percent said the benefits outweigh the risks.

The poll also looked at Americans' views on the MMR vaccine among different ideologies. It found that 25 percent of people who identify as conservative said that parents should be able to decide not to vaccine their children, compared with 15 percent of people who identify as moderate, and 9 percent of people who identify as liberal. Still, the majority of conservatives (73 percent) said that healthy children should be required to get the MMR vaccine to attend school, and 90 percent of liberals agreed with this statement.

Historically, some people with concerns about vaccines have cited a now-widely discredited study linking the MMR vaccine to autism. There are now more than 20 rigorous scientific studies that have failed to find a link between the MMR vaccine and autism, and the original study was retracted, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The poll results are based on interviews with 1,549 Americans ages 18 or older, which took place from May to June 2016. The survey sample is nationally representative, and the poll's margin of error is 4 percent, Pew said.",mainstream,M0b407,vaccine; vaccine.autism
243,"Pregnant women can breathe easy about getting flu and whooping cough vaccines during pregnancy, and there's no reason to be concerned about getting them both at the same time, experts say.

Doctors previously recommended the two vaccines be given weeks apart. But a new, six-year study published Wednesday in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology reports that getting the shots at the same time is just as safe as spacing them out.

The researchers analyzed data on 36,844 women, ages 14 to 49, who received flu and whooping cough vaccines during pregnancy between 2007 and 2013. In 23 percent of pregnancies the vaccines were given at the same time and in the other 77 percent the vaccines were administered at separate times.

Vaccine research scientist and study co-author Marlene Lugg said they found no significant increased risk of fever or other adverse effects to mother or baby.

""There was no difference in early birth, low birth weight, in any of the babies' outcomes,"" said Lugg.

Dr. Richard Beigi, Chief Medical Officer and Vice President of Medical Affairs at Magee-Womens Hospital at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, told CBS News there was no reason to believe getting the two vaccines together would be unsafe in pregnant women, but it had never been addressed before in research.

""This study is reassuring in that it involved thousands of women at multiple centers,"" said Beigi, who is also a spokesperson for the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. ""It validates what we've already known for years but it's really nice to see this. It provides reassurance that when you give them together it's very safe. There's no signal in study that would be of concern for an OB care provider.""

Beigi said this study doesn't delve into how the vaccines impact the unborn baby after birth, but he said, ""There's no reason to believe there would be an issue.""

He said research suggests that if you immunize a mother with the flu vaccine it protects the baby as well. ""Numerous studies show immunizing the mother protects the baby.""

Pregnant women who catch the flu are at risk for serious complications and hospitalization, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Beigi said it's not clear why they're more vulnerable but it may be linked to immunological or anatomical changes during pregnancy.

Lugg said pregnant women need to ""understand that it's extremely safe and it protects them and the baby.""

Protection against whooping cough is also important for pregnant women and others who spend time around newborns since the illness can be extremely serious for infants.

Expectant mom Emily Whitehead, 32, is due in seven weeks and said she plans to get vaccinated against flu and whooping cough. The DTaP vaccine includes tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough.

However, he said some of the restrictions on the 1.5 million vulnerable people who have been told to ""shield"" themselves for 12 weeks could be lifted, even if there was not a vaccine.

Mr Hancock told Sky News: ""If a vaccine can't be found then we have to learn to find a way to live with this virus so that means getting the numbers down and holding them down through, for instance, mass-scale testing and then tracing the virus through a combination of technology and human contact tracers.""

""If we succeed in doing that we will be able to take clinical advice on whether it is safe for those who are shielded to, for instance, to hug their grandchildren. That is right at the front of my mind.""

Mr Hancock was answering Britons questions about coronavirus, the government's handling of the outbreak and how and when lockdown restrictions will be eased.

He rejected claims the Government had sacrificed people in care homes in order to protect the NHS during the pandemic.

But he acknowledged that a lack of capacity meant it had not been possible to test everyone leaving hospitals for Covid-19 before they went into a care home.

The Health Secretary claimed the UK is now a world leader in testing for Covid-19.

He dmitted that it would have been ""wonderful"" to have a diagnostics industry like Germany to tackle the coronavirus crisis - but insisted the UK has now caught up with the Germans in terms of testing.

It came after Security Minister James Brokenshire said ""capacity constraints"" meant widespread checks in the community were scrapped in mid-March.

Mr Hancock also said it is too soon to say when schools are able to return.

He said he was left speechless by Professor Neil Ferguson's breach of lockdown rules and subsequent resignation from Sage.

Professor Ferguson was right to resign from the scientific advice board and social distancing rules are in place for everyone. he added.

Mr Hancock said it was a matter for the police whether they would take any action against Professor Ferguson for breaching the rules.

Asked by a viewer during a Q&A how they could safely reopen their cafe once the lockdown is lifted, Mr Hancock said some businesses could utilise more outdoor working during the summer months.

433,"We don’t have enough evidence yet to know if recovering from covid-19 induces immunity, or whether any immunity would give long-lasting protection against the coronavirus

SAY you have caught covid-19 and recovered – are you now immune for life, or could you catch it again? We just don’t know yet.

In February, reports emerged of a woman in Japan who had been given the all-clear after having covid-19 but then tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus a second time. There have also been reports of a man in Japan testing positive after being given the all-clear, and anecdotal cases of second positives have emerged from China, too.

This has raised fears that people may not develop immunity to the virus. This would mean that, until we have an effective vaccine, we could all experience repeated rounds of infection.

But the science is still uncertain. “There is some anecdotal evidence of reinfections, but we really don’t know,” says Ira Longini at the University of Florida. It may be that the tests used were unreliable, which is a problem with tests for other respiratory viruses, says Jeffrey Shaman at Columbia University in New York.

Early signs from small animal experiments are reassuring. A team from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in Beijing exposed four rhesus macaques to the virus. A week later, all four were ill with covid-19-like symptoms and had high virus loads. Two weeks later, the macaques had recovered and were confirmed to have antibodies to the virus in their bloodstream.

“You can be infected with other coronaviruses over and over. We don’t know if that’s true for this virus”

The researchers then tried to reinfect two of them but failed, which suggests the animals were immune (bioRxiv, doi.org/ggn8r8). “That finding is very encouraging, as it suggests that it is possible to induce protective immunity against the virus,” says Alfredo Garzino-Demo at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.

But that doesn’t necessarily mean long-term immunity. There are other coronaviruses circulating among humans and although they induce immunity, this doesn’t last. “Some other viruses in the coronavirus family, such as those that cause common colds, tend to induce immunity that is relatively short-lived, at around three months,” says Peter Openshaw at Imperial College London.

“Because [the virus] is so new, we do not yet know how long any protection generated through infection will last. We urgently need more research looking at the immune responses of people who have recovered from infection to be sure,” says Openshaw.

Other immunologists agree. “Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is not yet well understood and we do not know how protective the antibody response will be in the long-term,” says Erica Bickerton at the Pirbright Institute in the UK.

“For ordinary coronavirus infections, you do not get lasting immunity,” says Longini. “You can be infected over and over, and we really don’t know for this novel coronavirus if that’s also true.”

Other infectious disease specialists are more optimistic. “The evidence is increasingly convincing that infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to an antibody response that is protective. Most likely this protection is for life,” says Martin Hibberd at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “Although we need more evidence to be sure of this, people who have recovered are unlikely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 again.”

(Greg Nash/Pool via AP)

WASHINGTON (AP) — Despite White House claims, the U.S. still lacks a comprehensive battle plan against the coronavirus in critical areas including masks, testing, treatments and vaccines, whistleblower Rick Bright warned Thursday in testimony before a House committee. “Our window of opportunity is closing,” he declared.

The nation could face “the darkest winter in modern history” if the virus rebounds, the government vaccine scientist told lawmakers. Bright’s appearance came after his ouster last month as head of a Health and Human Services biodefense agency, an action he alleges was retaliation by the Trump administration.

“We need still a comprehensive plan, and everyone across the government and everyone in America needs to know what that plan is, and what role they play,” he told the House Energy and Commerce Committee. “There are critical steps that we need to do to prepare ... we do not still have enough personal protective equipment to manage our health care workers ... we still do not have the supply chains ramped up for the drugs and vaccines, and we still don’t have plans in place for how we distribute those drugs and vaccines. We still do not have a comprehensive testing strategy.”

At the White House, President Donald Trump said Bright looked like an “angry, disgruntled employee,” and Bright’s boss, HHS Secretary Alex Azar, said, “Everything he is complaining about was achieved.”

“So this is like somebody who was in a choir and is now trying to say he was a soloist back then,” Azar added.

Trump, said later, at a Pennsylvania medical equipment distributor, that the U.S. is ramping up production of COVID-19-related items and that his goal “is to produce everything America needs for ourselves and then export to the world, including medicines.”

Bright spoke in measured tones and rarely raised his voice during five hours of questioning. He didn’t question the fact that there’s now an all-out effort, financed by billions in taxpayer dollars, to procure masks and other supplies, develop better tests and treatments and discover an effective vaccine. His point was that those efforts aren’t being fitted together in a coherent strategy that will get supplies and medicines to where they’re most needed to protect people and prevent shortages and price gouging.

Asked by Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass., if administration officials have prepared the country for the “moment we are in” and the months ahead, Bright responded, “I think we have a lot of work to do to be prepared.”

Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., asked if he should be concerned that Americans will have problems getting access to a vaccine when it’s available. Bright responded, “Absolutely, sir.”

Bright, a career official, alleges he was removed as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority after repeatedly warning higher-ups the virus outbreak was going to be worse than the public was being led to believe.

He said the breaking point came when he opposed a White House directive to allow widespread access to hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug Trump was touting as an effective treatment.

The FDA recently warned against its use for COVID-19, except in limited circumstances. But at the White House on Thursday, the president was still bullish. “We’ve had tremendous response to the hydroxy,” Trump said. “So, a lot of people have sworn by it, and we’ll see.”

Republican lawmakers for the most part were careful not to attack Bright directly. But Rep. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma criticized him for continuing to collect his $285,000 salary while first on sick leave for a spike in blood pressure, and now on vacation as he tries to straighten out his work situation.

“You’re too sick to go into work, but you’re well enough to come here while getting paid,” said Mullin. “I have a hard time understanding that.”

Bright said one of the worst moments as he tried to raise alarms came when repeated efforts to jump-start U.S. production of respirator masks went nowhere.

He recalled getting emails in late January from Mike Bowen, an executive at a medical supply company called Prestige Ameritech, indicating that its N95 mask supply was “completely decimated.”

“And he said: ‘We’re in deep shit. The world is. And we need to act,’” Bright said. “And I pushed that forward to the highest levels I could in HHS and got no response. From that moment I knew that we were going to have a crisis for our health care workers because we were not taking action.”

Following Bright to the witness table, Bowen told lawmakers he’s a Republican who voted for Trump. He paused then, and added that he admires Bright.

As part of his whistleblower complaint, Bright is seeking to be reinstated in his old job. A federal watchdog agency has found “reasonable grounds” that he was removed as a reprisal.

HHS, Bright’s employer, says it strongly disagrees with his allegations and says it reassigned him to a high-profile position helping to lead the development of new coronavirus tests at the National Institutes of Health.

Nearly 85,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S., representing more than one-fourth of global deaths and the world’s highest toll, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide more than 4.4 million have been infected and about 300,000 have died.

Bright’s testimony followed this week’s warning by Dr. Anthony Fauci , the government’s top infectious disease expert, that a rushed lifting of store-closing and stay-at-home restrictions could “turn back the clock,” seeding more suffering and death and complicating efforts to get the economy rolling again.

Eager to restart the U.S. economy, Trump has been urging states to lift restrictions, and many governors are doing so gradually, though consumers remain leery of going back to restaurants, social events and sporting competitions.

Bright, who has a doctoral degree in immunology, said the nation’s path forward should be based on science. The steps include:

— Establishing a national testing strategy. The White House has urged states to take the lead on testing, even as the federal government pushes to make more tests and better ones widely available. Trump says the U.S. has “prevailed” on testing through this strategy, but in Congress Democrats are demanding a federal framework to encompass the whole nation.

— Doubling down on educating the public about basic safety measures such as frequent hand-washing and wearing masks in public places . “Frankly, our leaders must lead by modeling the behavior,” said Bright, in a not-too-subtle reference to a president who conspicuously goes maskless .

— Setting up a system to fairly distribute equipment and supplies that are scarce and highly sought. Eliminating state vs. state competition would increase efficiency and reduce costs.",mainstream,M0b023,vaccine
798,"It is an everyday miracle, mysterious and beguiling, and it is replicated several thousand times over, at all hours, in churches that are beautiful and churches that are not. The priest consecrates the bread, and then he consecrates the wine, and there on the altar the meal becomes the body and blood of Christ. Then, just as Jesus broke bread and shared wine with the apostles at the Last Supper, believers rise from the pews, receive the host, eat it, and, one by one, drink the Precious Blood, putting their lips to the same cup.

That last part doesn’t happen these days. Churches are closed and services have been moved online, for one, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also advised against it. Before the pandemic, William Ouweleen had drunk from such a cup countless times. A vintner in the Finger Lakes region of New York, he used to attend mass and receive communion at St. Matthew Church, in Livonia, where the Precious Blood in the chalice had been a blush-colored wine that he’d made. Ouweleen runs a winery named O-Neh-Da, which makes sacramental wine that churches use to celebrate the Eucharist. The winery, which is next to Hemlock Lake—“o-neh-da” is the Seneca word for “hemlock”—is the go-to for Catholics in the Northeast. When Pope Francis visited New York City, in 2015, he used O-Neh-Da wine for a mass at Madison Square Garden.

In contrast to regular wine, which might be made with extra yeast, tannin powders, and flavorings, Communion wine must be “natural, from the fruit of the grape, pure and incorrupt, not mixed with other substances,” according to Vatican instructions. So, last fall, Ouweleen, a self-described “hippie” who is fifty-eight and wears his hair in dreadlocks, did what he does every fall: he harvested forty acres’ worth of grapes, trucked them to his winery, crushed them, and allowed them to ferment with no additives. (Except, that is, for some added sulfites, just before bottling—a preservative sanctioned by the Vatican.)

By springtime, he had fifty thousand gallons of wine in his cellar. This time of year, he would usually be filling fifteen hundred wine bottles per day, in order to deliver them to churches in New York and Pennsylvania, and to religious-goods stores as far away as Florida and Guam. But he isn’t doing that this year, because it would mean purchasing glass bottles to fill with wine that might not sell. Ouweleen doesn’t know when the churches will reopen. This past Friday, President Trump deemed houses of worship “essential” and asked all governors to allow them “to open right now, for this weekend,” but, in New York, houses of worship can only fully reopen in the last phase of the state’s four-part reopening plan, along with stadiums and amusement parks. Ouweleen is also not sure that, when they do reopen, they will continue to serve consecrated wine, which, in most of the country’s Catholic churches, is drunk from a chalice that is shared by the entire congregation.

So he decided to ask them. Last month, Ouweleen typed up a letter to the bishop in Albany, to ask if he had any foresight on the future of sacramental wine. A week later, still awaiting a reply, Ouweleen broadened his query, writing to more than a thousand parishes—all customers of his—to ask if they plan to distribute the Eucharist by chalice, once church services resume. In his letter to the priests, Ouweleen explained that O-Neh-Da had survived—by God’s grace—several wars, the Great Depression, and Prohibition, but, “the Good Lord helps those who help themselves, so we are taking an active role in planning for the other side of this pandemic.”

Ouweleen figured that the wine in his cellar would last for about a year before its taste started to fade. “I’ll know what to do with that wine when I know what to do,” he said. “This graceful hand of the unseen has been very present in my life, and I respect that.” In the meantime, he continued checking in on his vineyard. By September, his vines will have produced two hundred tons of grapes, which will yield another forty thousand gallons of wine. It was getting warm, and the vines were about to bud.

There are three major sacramental wineries in the United States: Mont La Salle and Cribari, both in California, and O-Neh-Da, in New York, which is the smallest and the oldest. Established in 1872 by Bishop Bernard McQuaid, the first bishop of Rochester, O-Neh-Da was originally run by seminarians, and, later, by monks. In 2002, it was purchased by Steven Goldstone, who’d recently retired as the C.E.O. of RJR Nabisco, the food and tobacco conglomerate, and who’d seen a notice in the Wall Street Journal advertising a winery for sale in the Finger Lakes. (Goldstone, a private pilot, liked to fly over the region in his plane.)

In 2007, there was another ad—this time, in the PennySaver, for a rental house on the O-Neh-Da Winery’s property, which would cost eight hundred and fifty dollars a month. Ouweleen responded to it; he and his wife, Lisa Woodhams, and his stepson, Jacob, were facing eviction from their home in Conesus. The family was continuously hard up—Ouweleen was the manager of an organic market that was trying (and failing) to compete with Wegmans—and they were searching for a gentler, more Christ-like life. (They wrote a prayer: “Land with a view / a ridge line or two … a place to grow / with maintenance kept low / sanctuary where / we reap what we sow.” “Divinity,” it concluded, “make it so.”) The rental, an old winemaker’s house built in the twenties, with three bedrooms, and a lot of bats in the attic, felt fated.

The family moved in and learned, upon their arrival, that the winery on the grounds wasn’t doing too well. (They had regular encounters with the winemaker, who kept knocking on their door, asking if they had any spare trash bags or light bulbs.) Ouweleen was also looking for a new job, so he called Goldstone and told him, “I think I’m supposed to be here to help you with this winery.”

Goldstone flew north to meet with Ouweleen, who had prepared a PowerPoint presentation on what he described as the brand’s “natural assets,” such as its long, almost romantic history of sequestered religious men ministering to its grapes. Ouweleen had no experience in wine-making, but, Goldstone said later, “It’s not like I had a long line of prestigious winemakers waiting to be interviewed for the job.” Goldstone decided, of Ouweleen and his family, that “they belong there.” The two men worked out an arrangement in which Ouweleen would run O-Neh-Dah. A year later, Woodhams joined him. (She’d been bartending and waiting tables until she was sure that this sacramental winery gig was going to work out.)

Together with one other full-time employee and several part-time staff, Ouweleen and Woodhams do the work of a hundred unpaid monks. Ouweleen plays Reggae for the fermenting grapes—“conscious music,” he said, “to encourage them”—and tastes and adjusts the wine. He also fixes the bottle-capper, and the crusher, and the labeller, and the filler, and the air-compressor, and the tractor, when they break. Woodhams pays the bills, answers the phones, puts together wholesale orders, and coördinates the family’s appearances at wine tastings. Friends help them bottle the wine.

“It’s like if a Catholic school lost all their nuns,” Ouweleen said. “It’s noble but unprofitable work.” This is true even when there’s no pandemic. (O-Neh-Da charges about eighty dollars for a case of twelve bottles of sacramental wine, and the average church customer orders twenty cases of wine a year.) But it has been a reliable source of income, which, for Ouweleen, feels nothing short of miraculous. In the spring, when the grapevines begin to sprout, the robins are loudest in the mornings and the woodpeckers are busiest in the evenings. In the fall, when the grapes are harvested—first the Rosette, then the Delaware—the lake reflects the orange of the trees. Every year is different but also the same. The family has been able to count on it.",mainstream,M086c8,vaccine.covid
820,"In December, 1962, Esquire magazine established what it called its Dubious Achievement Awards.

These were a series of fictional prizes given to celebrities, politicians, and business leaders who committed some egregious blunder that year, a gaffe worthy of a kind of Hall of Shame.

The annual event became so popular that readers and media hungered for it year after year.

Now there are dubious awards everywhere, across all genres — movies, television, commercials.

Every news organization hungers to win awards. They display them in glass cases in the lobby. They write stories about the individual winners.

Your public broadcaster is no different. We love getting awards. The award season is about to begin, with various programs submitting entries to award-conferring bodies. Over the years, the CBC — radio and television — has received hundreds of plaques, statuettes, proclamations recognizing significant achievements in reporting and broadcasting.

At the tail end of 2016, we received an official looking envelope containing an official, suitable-for-framing, award certificate. Because of its importance, I want to read the official proclamation word for word:

To wit - ""The 2016 Adding Insult to Injury Award, recognizing deception, distortion and dishonesty in Media, awarded to CBC Radio — The Sunday Edition.""

The award was presented by the Board of Directors of Vaccine Choice Canada.

For those unaware of Vaccine Choice Canada, it is an organization opposed to the compulsory vaccination of children.

Its argument is that ordinary vaccinations can neurologically wound children or kill them outright. It blames vaccination for seeming increases in autism spectrum disorder.

It assiduously ignores the burden of evidence from the World Health Organization at the top of the health chain, down to your local family physician and pharmacist, that this is not the case.

Measles is one of the most contagious and deadly diseases on the planet. It kills about 100,000 children every year.

What Vaccine Choice Canada objects to is a story we broadcast on last June on the backfire effect.

I interviewed an American professor named Brendan Nyhan. He explained the backfire effect as the inability of many people to change their opinions, even after presented with irrefutable facts to the contrary.

It matters not how many facts are marshalled to contradict them. They are resolute, even reinforced, in their views.

During the interview, Professor Nyhan used the anti-vaccine movement as another example of the intransigence of people holding views which are contradicted by evidence.

With the anti-vaccine movement, it is especially difficult. As the New York Times pointed out in early January, the anti-vaccine group ""is not a bastion of rationality.""

Although study after study has demonstrated there is no link between vaccination and such diseases as autism, the anti-vaxxers continue their crusade.

You have to be an automaton not to feel sorry for parents dealing with autism, who search for some explanation for their child's disorder. In desperation they turn to garbage science and conspiracy theories.

The American Academy of Pediatrics has issued a 21 page document listing all the studies showing that there is no link between vaccines and autism.

Nevertheless, the arguments put out by the anti-vaxxers seems to be gaining ground in the United State, especially in the south and especially in Texas.

Peter Hotez is a pediatrician with the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. Dr. Hotez, writing in the New York Times, said that because the number of unvaccinated children is rising, there could be serious outbreaks of measles in his state.

It doesn't help things when the sitting president believes that vaccines cause autism.

Dr. Hotez said: ""I'm worried that our nation's health will soon be threatened because we have not stood up to the pseudoscience and fake conspiracy claims of this movement.""

In 2000, the US Centres for Disease Control announced that measles had been eliminated in the United States, meaning it was no longer endemic to the US.

Now it appears to be coming back. Which means a renewed attention on the importance of vaccination and the skeptics who oppose it.

So on behalf of The Sunday Edition, I humbly accept the 2016 Adding Insult to Injury Award, and give it pride of place in our office.

514,"WASHINGTON — Dr. Anthony Fauci says the government is working on several potential vaccines for COVID-19.

“We have many candidates and hope to have many winners,” he told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee. “In other words, it is many shots on goal.”

Despite the rapid pace of work on vaccines, Fauci was offering no guarantees. He says, “The big unknown is efficacy.”

Fauci heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and is the government’s leading expert on the pandemic. He says he hopes to have a vaccine in advanced trials by late fall or early winter.

746,"Well, it gets very technical, and I don’t want to get into the technicalities of this. But basically, these were futures contracts that rolled over. And so this was a phenomena that occurred over a 12 to 24-hour period. So there’s something a bit artificial about it. But it does reflect something that’s real. Nobody wants the oil. It is not a precious commodity right now because people are not driving, people are not flying, cruise ships are not cruising, and industry is not burning as much fuel as it was. And yet the world is still producing this oil.

That’s right. So all of those things were done. But all that was accomplished, and it was something, was to stem the bleeding. And that brings us to the second trauma, which is the early years of the current century. When suddenly, our production is in decline again. China is growing by leaps and bounds. India is starting to grow by leaps and bounds. A middle class is growing around the developing world. So demand is going up, like, 5 million barrels a day around the world. And the Middle East is suddenly more unstable. And so prices skyrocket between the years of about 2004 and 2007.

Economically speaking, no question about it. By 2014, we were bringing down gasoline prices for consumers. It was part of our recovery from the recession. And all of this American production puts the United States in a extremely powerful position economically, employing millions of people and producing revenues for state and local governments across much of the country. Also giving the United States the freedom to act in foreign policy in ways that would have been unheard-of years before, such as putting pressure on Iran without endangering our energy supply. It was basically the culmination of the dream from the 1970s. And it was hard to imagine, just a few months ago, what could happen that could undercut that dream.

So the oil has no place to go. And it’s rapidly filling up tank farms, strategic reserves around the world. Refineries are running out of space to put the oil. And so the inventories are building to a point where there’ll be no physical space to put the oil. You now have tankers which, you know, used to ship oil from place to place, just storing the oil and sitting out off of the shores of Los Angeles, for instance, and other places. And these are the people who are making a lot of money. They’re getting paid to just hold the oil.

Well, that’s beginning to happen, but it’s a cumbersome, complex process. First of all, you have thousands of producers in the United States. We don’t have a national oil company which is taking orders from the government, such as in Saudi Arabia. And then there are complications that go along with shutting in wells. It’s an expensive process. You can actually damage the resource to the point where, when you restart the oil, you’ll actually pump less oil out. And then, you have all of these companies that, even when they’re losing money, they need cash flow. They need cash flow to meet their payroll, to meet their debt responsibilities. So what oil companies prefer to do, you let the well, basically, slowly decline.",mainstream,M078be,vaccine
673,"Humans are hard-wired to avoid uncertainty. But when it comes to the coronavirus crisis, uncertainty is unavoidable. Every day, we’re bombarded with ambiguous, complex, and often conflicting information. To make sense out of all this noise, the authors describe a framework for understanding different types of informational uncertainty. They then suggest several strategies for coping with that uncertainty, both cognitively (to more effectively process and make sense of information) and emotionally (to mitigate the stress and anxiety that result from uncertainty).

Will colleges and universities restart in-person classes this fall? Will there be a vaccine for the novel coronavirus soon? Will there be second wave of the virus? Do I wear a mask outside even if I plan to socially distance? How can I figure out which news sources and leaders to trust?

Every day we are faced with a torrent of information from news articles, cable networks, social media, the White House, the Center for Disease Control – and yet, there are no clear answers.

As humans, we innately find uncertainty to be an aversive state and are motivated to reduce it, even at a cost. Research has shown that people are calmer and less agitated when they know they are going to receive an electric shock than when they know there is a 50% chance they might receive an electric shock. Similarly, the threat of perceived job insecurity has more detrimental health effects than actually losing a job.

Feeling uncertain is not a natural state of being for us — it signals to the brain that things are not right. The brain then seeks out information to resolve the uncertainty. This desire for resolution is why feelings of uncertainty lead us to process information more systematically and deeply in the hope of finding answers.

But the coronavirus pandemic leaves us in a quandary: Our natural instinct is to try to resolve our intense feelings of uncertainty, but there is so much uncertainty around the virus and its effects that a quest for complete resolution is futile. So what can we do?

First, it is important to understand that uncertainty is multi-dimensional. There are at least three types of uncertainty: probability, ambiguity, and complexity. To cope with each, we have identified several strategies, both cognitive (to more effectively process and make sense of information) and emotional (to mitigate the stress and anxiety that result from uncertainty).

Probability uncertainty refers to situations in which it is difficult to ascertain risk levels: Not only do you not know what will happen, you also don’t know how likely each outcome is. For example, how much am I really at risk compared to others in my group? People of my age? People where I live? People who behave like me?

As a cognitive coping mechanism, the first thing to do is to understand that you are at risk as much as any other member of your group. Research shows that people tend to underestimate their own risk of contracting a disease or encountering a negative event. This is a self-positivity bias, that needs to be overcome. Recognize that you are as much at risk as everyone else, and focus on what you know you can do to reduce risk by complying with expert recommendations (e.g., wash hands often, wear facial coverings in public, maintain social distancing). Don’t be that person who gets yelled at in a grocery store for not wearing a mask!

Emotionally, it is important to embrace that you are at as much risk as the people around you and empathize with them on this common ground. Connect virtually (or in person with appropriate social distance, if allowed) with people you care about, whether they are friends, family or neighbors. Accept that we’re all in the same boat and we’re all doing our best to get through this together.

Ambiguity uncertainty refers to situations in which we are faced with imprecise, insufficient, or conflicting information. For example, we were told that the virus could be transmitted through hard surfaces such as cardboard, plastic, metal, etc. Now the CDC believes that the virus is mostly airborne and that the chances of contracting the virus through surfaces is very small. What does that mean for my behavior? Can I get the virus from not just someone’s cough, but if they speak to me? Is six feet of social distancing enough to protect myself?

As a cognitive coping mechanism, consolidate the different sources of information and try to get clarity through what social scientists call triangulation (i.e., using multiple measures or methods to ensure that they all converge on the same result). Rely most on information that is reported consistently through multiple reliable sources. But also understand that the coronavirus is novel, and that the science around it keeps evolving. So sometimes we need to find a non-cognitive approach that does not involve trying to resolve uncertainty.

Cope emotionally by knowing when it’s time to end the search for more information. Sources such as the CDC warn against information overload: “Take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories, including social media. Hearing about the pandemic repeatedly can be upsetting.” Recognize that the endless search for clarity can create more stress than it alleviates, and sometimes enough is enough.

This occurs when an issue is technically complex and difficult to understand: For example, for non-statisticians, it can be hard to understand what “flattening the curve” really means, why it’s important, and how to balance different factors such as resource constraints, geographical variances, and economic considerations. Is it true that a week’s delay in lockdown in March led to a loss of 36,000 lives? And now, how is each state or county making the decision to reopen, and how are they balancing economic loss against the loss of human life?

As a cognitive coping mechanism, consult an expert source well versed in the field to break down complex information into understandable nuggets. Make sure to find sources grounded in science, not partisanship. And again, recognize when the quest for information is helpful, and when it isn’t. Maybe what’s needed right now is not to understand the details of each epidemiological model, but instead to just understand what actions we need to take to be safe. Simplify the complexity into an actionable piece of information (e.g., wear a mask when going outside).

If this gets too overwhelming, cope emotionally by finding ways to escape the complexity: Re-watch a favorite TV show, knit a blanket, or organize your closet by color. Or if you can, escape your own stresses by making this world a little less stressful for others: Donate to your local food bank, support your local businesses, or even bail someone out of jail.

Taking these steps to mitigate informational uncertainty will leave you with the mental bandwidth to cope with the many other important issues we all face. And in these trying times, it’s best to take every chance you get to unwind and find some moments of zen.",mainstream,M07d41,vaccine; vaccine.covid

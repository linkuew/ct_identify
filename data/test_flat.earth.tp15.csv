Communication from mission command in the Alps is delayed CD minutes , so when the geo - radar stops working , the CD walk back to their all - terrain vehicles and radio colleagues nearby at base camp for guidance . But this is n't the Red NNP - it 's the Arabian Peninsula . The desolate desert in southern Oman , near the borders of Yemen and Saudi Arabia , resembles Mars so much that more than 200 NNS from 25 nations chose it as their location for the next four weeks , to field - test technology for a manned mission to Mars . JJ and private ventures are racing toward Mars - both JJ NNP Barack Obama and SpaceX founder Elon Musk declared NNS MD walk on the Red NNP in a few decades . JJ challengers IN NNP are joining the NNP NNPS and NNP in NN with an ambitious , if vague , Mars program . Aerospace corporations IN BlueOrigin have published schematics of future bases , ships and suits . The successful launch of SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket this week "" puts us in a completely JJ realm of what we can put into deep NN , what we can send to Mars , "" VBD analog astronaut Kartik Kumar . The next step to Mars , he VBZ , is to tackle non-engineering problems IN JJ emergency responses and isolation . "" These are things I VBP can't be underestimated , "" Kumar VBD . While cosmonauts and astronauts are learning valuable spacefaring skills on the International NNP Station - and the US is VBG virtual reality to train NNS - the majority of work to prepare for interplanetary expeditions is being done on NNP . And where best to field - test equipment and NNS for the journey to Mars but on some of the NN 's most forbidding spots ? Seen from NN , the Dhofar Desert is a JJ , brown expanse . Few animals or plants survive in the desert expanses of the Arabian Peninsula , where NNS can top 125 degrees Fahrenheit , or 51 degrees Celsius . On the eastern edge of a seemingly endless dune is the Oman Mars Base : a giant 2.4 - ton inflated habitat surrounded by shipping containers turned into labs and crew quarters . There are no airlocks . The desert 's NN resembles Mars so much , it 's hard to tell the difference , Kumar VBD , his spacesuit caked in dust . "" But it goes deeper than that : the types of geomorphology , all the structures , the salt domes , the riverbeds , the wadis , it parallels a lot of what we VBP on Mars . "" The Omani NN offered to host the Austrian NNP Forum 's next Mars simulation during a meeting of the NNP Nation 's Committee On the Peaceful Uses of Outer NNP . Gernot Groemer , commander of the Oman Mars simulation and a veteran of 11 NN missions on NNP , VBD the forum quickly accepted . NNS from across the NN sent ideas for experiments and the mission , named AMADEE - 18 , quickly grew to 16 scientific experiments , such as testing a "" tumbleweed "" whip - fast robot rover and a JJ NN suit called Aouda . The cutting - edge spacesuit , weighing about 50 kilograms , is called a "" personal spaceship "" because PRP can breathe , eat and do hard NN inside it . The suit 's visor displays maps , communications and sensor NNS . A blue piece of foam in front of the chin can be VBN to wipe your nose and mouth . "" No matter who is VBG to this grandest voyage of our society yet to come , I VBP a few things we learn here will be actually implemented in those missions , "" Groemer VBD . The Soviet Union 's 1957 launch of Sputnik ignited a NN race between Moscow and NNP to land a crew on the NNP . But before the U.S. got there RB , astronauts IN Neil Armstrong trained suspended on pulleys to simulate CD - sixth of NNP 's gravity . Hostile environments from Arizona to Siberia were VBN to fine - tune capsules , landers , rovers and suits - simulating otherworldly dangers to be VBN beyond NNP . NN agencies call them "" analogues "" because they resemble extraterrestrial extremes of cold and remoteness . "" You can test systems on those locations and VB where the breaking points are , and you can VB where things start to fail and which design option you VBP to take in order to assure that it does not fail on Mars , "" VBD João Lousada , CD of the Oman simulation 's deputy field commanders who is a flight controller for the International NNP Station . Faux NN stations have been built underwater off the coast of Florida , on frigid dark deserts of Antarctica , and in volcanic craters in Hawaii , according to "" Packing For Mars , "" a favourite book among JJ Mars NNS , written by Mary Roach . "" Terrestrial analogs are a tool in the toolkit of NN exploration , but they are not a panacea , "" VBD Scott Hubbard , VBN as "" Mars Czar "" back when he lead the US NN agency 's Mars program . Some simulations have helped developed cameras , rovers , suits and closed - loop NN - support systems , he VBD . NNP VBD the Mojave Desert to test rovers destined for the Red NNP but they RB discovered much about how NNS can adapt . "" NN 's adaptability in an unstructured environment is still far , far better than any robot we can send to NN , "" Hubbard VBD , adding that NNS , not just robots , are the key to exploring Mars . The European NNP Agency 's list of "" planetary analogues "" includes projects in Chile , Peru , South Africa , Namibia , Morocco , Italy , Spain , Canada , Antarctica , NNP , NNP , Australia , India , Germany , Norway , Iceland , and nine US NNS . Next Thursday , Israeli NNS are to run a shorter simulation in a nature preserve called D Mars . However , there remain so JJ unknowns that simulations "" are not in any NN a replacement for being there , "" Hubbard VBD . "" The JJ person to walk on Mars has in fact already been born , and might be VBG to elementary school now in Oman , or back in Europe , in the US or NNP , "" Lousada VBD ."

But no NN VBD its NN exactly how to do that . After NNP built the NN that recommends videos to its NNS , JJ employees IN Guillaume Chaslot , a software engineer in artificial intelligence who worked on the site 's recommendation engine in 2010 - 2011 , VBD he watched as it started pushing NNS toward NN videos . Chaslot VBD the platform ’s complex “ machine learning ” NN , which uses trial and error combined with statistical analysis to figure out how to VB NNS to watch more videos , figured out that the best NN to VB NNS to spend more NN on NNP was to show them videos light on facts but rife with wild speculation . Routine searches on NNP can generate quality , personalized recommendations that lead to good NN , exciting storytelling from independent voices , and authoritative NN sources . But they can RB return recommendations for videos that assert , for example , that the NNP is JJ , aliens are underneath Antarctica , and mass shooting survivors are NN actors . This is n’t just a NNP problem . Chaslot ’s research on NNP , which he released earlier this NN , added to growing concerns about the pervasiveness of similar algorithms throughout modern society . “ They ’re VBN to give us a credit score , to decide whether you VBP a job interview , evaluate your college application . They all use algorithms , ” VBD NN scientist Cathy O’Neil , author of “ Weapons of Math Destruction . ” “ All those bureaucratic decision - making systems , ” use algorithms , she VBD , RB as part of the criminal sentencing process . Several NNS are VBG these computer models to decide lengths of prison NN or set bail amounts — which some critics have accused of perpetuating racial bias . Algorithms trained by JJ NNS are now present in the daily lives of billions of NNS . And 2.2 CD of them are on NNP . On the site , the ease with which a person on can be transported from any innocuous search to the lunatic fringe of NNP is startling . This reporter was helping his son research outer NN for his school project . When he searched for "" Saturn , "" the JJ results were mostly documentaries . CD of the recommended videos was "" CD facts you did n't VB about NN . "" That NN led to additional recommendations such as "" can you VB it "" videos , a synthesized voice reading Nostradamus predictions and a clip "" they do n't VB you to VB "" of pro-Putin propaganda . What had started out as a simple search for fun NN facts for kindergartners had quickly led to a vast NN ecosystem . Every day NNP serves RB CD CD NNS who watch billions of hours of NN . NNS use it to search for the latest music videos , learn how to fix their car and write research papers . The site ’s videos RB make it into Google search results , expanding their reach to potentially billions of searches per day . NNP , as CD of our primary windows into the NN , is shaping our understanding of it . The massive amounts of NN available inside has led CEO Susan Wojcicki to call the site a “ library . ” And NNP is just part of it . Google ’s search algorithm and NNP ’s NN Feed algorithm RB serve as filters for NN for billions of NNS . “ There is an infrastructure built since the Renaissance to ensure the integrity of NN and NN in libraries , JJ layers of gatekeepers thick , ” wrote David Carroll , an associate professor of NN design at The NNP School and a VBN critic of JJ platforms , in an email . “ You Tube dispenses with all of it in the name of frictionless NN acquisition and an algorithm optimized for watch - NN to sell ads . ” Chaslot , a software engineer in artificial intelligence , worked on a project to introduce diversity to NNP ’s NN recommendations starting in 2010 . It did n’t do as well for watch NN , he VBD , so it was shut down and not VBN . "" This is dangerous because this is an algorithm that 's gaslighting NNS to make them VB that everybody lies to them just for the sake of watch NN , "" he VBD . He was moved to another group but tried to keep the original project VBG . According to a NNP spokesperson , Chaslot was eventually fired in 2013 over performance issues . Once on the outside , Chaslot VBD he created a program to analyze how the algorithm was recommending NN videos by VBG a NNP account with no viewing history to search for certain topics and collect which videos were recommended to NNS most . This means that while “ good ” or “ harmless ” videos might be included in the mix of recommendations , NNP repeatedly invited NNS to click on certain videos much more than others , essentially giving them free advertising . Chaslot initially shared his research with The Guardian . His analysis VBD that when searching for "" Is the NNP JJ or round ? "" the top recommendation NNP kept showing NNS in the beginning of February was "" THE BEST JJ NNP NN | 100 % Proof The NNP Is JJ | Please Debunk This I Dare You !!!! ” followed by "" Top CD Reasons NNS VB The NNP Is JJ ! "" and "" BEST NNP NNP PROOF 2017 - YOU CANT DENY THIS NN . "" Searching tragedies can turn up RB more disturbing results . If you searched for “ Sandy Hook Shooting ” in November 2017 , CD of the top recommended videos was the now removed "" VB YOUR OWN EYES - 9/11 - ' NO PLANES ' , "" followed by videos asserting the Connecticut school shooting and its victims were a hoax . Researchers at Harvard conducted their own test and VBD that the algorithm was more often drawing viewers to extreme NN and unfounded JJ - wing NN NNS . Experts VBP the NN videos are perfectly positioned to push our buttons and draw us in to consume more of them — signs that NNP ’s algorithm prioritizes , wrote Robert J. Blaskiewicz Jr. , a columnist for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry , a non-profit educational organization that applies scientific analysis to NN NN claims , in an email . "" NN stories hit our emotional fight or flight triggers , ” Blaskiewicz wrote . “ And the stories rest on the unstated premise that NN of the NN will protect you from being manipulated . This in itself compels NNS to watch and absorb as much as they can and to revisit videos . "" The emotion they provoke is contagious , he VBD , and they provide ready - made explanations for complex and difficult NN events . NNP has VBN it 's simply reflecting what NNS VBP to VB , and videos are chosen VBN on their individual profile and viewing history . Publicly , executives have VBN that the recommendations algorithm drives over 70 percent of NN watched on NNP , and that they ’re getting better and better at it all the NN . “ Our job is to give the user a steady stream , almost a synthetic or personalized channel , "" NNP 's chief product officer , Neal Mohan , VBD at CES , the annual consumer tech conference , in Las Vegas in January . "" Higher watch NN means more ad inventory , "" VBD Austin Moldow , an equity researcher at Canaccord Genuity , a financial services firm in NNP NNP . "" More ads , more revenue . "" But just because NNS are willing to watch something does n’t mean they ’re enjoying it . NNP has to balance protecting its profits with the trust of its NNS . Fail to walk the line and it can begin to undermine user value , VBD Kara Swisher , Recode executive editor and MSNBC contributor . "" I VBP it 's a problem not just throughout NNP , but Google , NNP , all these NNS is that they prioritize growth over anything else . They MD not be meaning to do it , but if growth is the goal , then user experience is not the goal , ” VBD Swisher . “ Real NNS , the ones you ’re trying to attract , VB away . And so it 's in all their interests from a business point of view to clean this place up and to have more NN over it and there 's a moral responsibility to create a platform that is n't being abused by anybody ” “ Good advertisers do n't wanna be next to these kind of videos either , ” she added . Exploiting the NNP algorithm is a cottage industry . NN creators who follow the rules can earn a share of advertising revenue . Trends favored by the algorithm are quickly incorporated and uploaded by savvy creators , VBD Becca Lewis , a researcher at NNP & Society , a nonprofit VBN in NNP NNP . Ultimately , if the recommendation engine is promoting NN videos , NNP incentivizes creating more of them . But more than just promoting — and prioritizing — misinformation , these digital tabloid channels can RB distort democracy . RB before the CD U.S. presidential NN , Chaslot 's research VBD more than 80 percent of the recommended videos favored Donald NNP . Searching "" NNP "" lead to pro-Trump NN recommendations . Searching "" NNP "" raised mainly anti-Clinton NN recommendations . NNP has taken steps to reduce incentives for some of the worst offenders . NN IN mass shootings are not allowed to generate advertising revenue for their creators through NNP . However , this does n’t stop creators from including links for direct donations in their NN descriptions , their JJ merchandise stores , affiliate links for apps or paid mentions within the videos . In a statement to NBC NNP , a NNP spokesperson VBD “ our recommendation NN has changed substantially over NN and no longer works the NN it did five NNS ago . ” While it VBD to optimize for “ watch NN , ” it now has begun to shift focus to “ satisfaction , ” balancing watch NN with additional NN points such as likes , dislikes , shares , and surveys . NNP has RB tweaked its algorithm to better show authoritative NN sources , especially for breaking NN events , the spokesperson VBD . According to NNP , none of the recommendation NN that Chaslot worked on while he was at Google is being VBN today . Critics fear that a few updates wo n’t resolve the core issue , VBD Tristan Harris , who previously worked as a Google design ethicist and is now a critic of his ex-employer , leading a JJ group of JJ technologists out of San Francisco called the Center for Humane Technology . VBG algorithms creates exponential solutions , CD for every customer or citizen , but RB exponential problems . “ You can't possibly have exponential consequences with exponential responsibility unless you have an exponential amount of JJ thought to be dedicated to those challenges , ” VBD Harris . “ And you ca n't put that just into an algorithm . ”"

Possible versions range from misread instruments leading to a stall to a murder - suicide . AirAsia flight QZ8501 abruptly went off radar on Sunday over the Java NNP shortly after the pilot requested air NN in Jakarta for permission to climb higher to avoid a storm . The permission was granted CD minutes later , but no response from the crew followed . The plane disappeared from radar screens three minutes later . No distress call was sent by the plane . Both facts indicated that it fell very quickly , with initial speculation saying that it MD have suffered catastrophic destruction in mid-air . But the discovery of the plane ’s body lying in CD piece on the seabed proved otherwise . Recovering NNS from flight and cockpit recorders MD be crucial for establishing the truth about the fate of QZ8501 , but some flight experts point out that the AirAsia Airbus A320 crash has similarities with another flight incident , that of Air France flight AF447 in 2009 . The plane was officially classed as missing for CD NNS and was VBN only in 2011 . The investigation showed instruments called pitot tubes froze and gave JJ airspeed readings to the crew . They failed to respond to the problem accordingly and did n’t notice that the plane was about to stall or to try to recover it . No CD accidents are the same . But there are similar conditions IN the NN , and we must look into it very closely , ” a JJ air crash investigator in Indonesia VBD Reuters . Unlike the AirAsia flight crash , Air France airliner stalled at nighttime when the crew MD n’t VB the horizon line and VB that the aircraft was losing altitude . QZ8501 was piloted by an experienced 53 - NN - old ex-Indonesian Air Force pilot VBN by the single name Iriyanto , who had 20,000 flying hours under his belt , including 6,100 hours in Airbuses . The co-pilot was Frenchman Remi Plesel with 2,275 flying hours . AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes expressed confidence in his pilot , saying he was CD of the best graduates at his JJ flight school . The Airbus A320 is a reliable aircraft with just 0.14 fatal accidents per CD takeoffs , according to a safety NN published by Boeing in August . With neither JJ error nor technical failure immediately pinned down as a likely NN , more sinister NNS about the crash have arisen . The plane MD have been damaged by a JJ bomb exploding onboard , John Nance , a JJ US Air Force pilot , VBD ABC NNP . “ Maybe CD that was n’t strong enough to blow the airplane into pieces at altitude , but maybe CD that blew the NN cables from the hydraulics , ” he VBD . An RB more exotic version MD be a deliberate crash by the pilot in a murder - suicide , Nance added . At least three crashes in the past 20 NNS were caused by this . CD example is SilkAir Flight 185 , RB from Indonesia , which crashed into a river in southern Sumatra in 1997 . Indonesian investigators reported that they MD n’t collect conclusive NN to rule on the NN of the incident . But the US National Transportation Safety Board , which participated in the investigation because the aircraft in question was a Boeing 737 , VBD the plane crashed due to deliberate input from the cockpit , most likely by the captain ."

Budget proposals unveiled by NNP NNP MD slash funding for NN research . Thoughtfully , US politicians are eager to fill in the looming NN gap with their own free - spirited NNS . National NNP Radio reports that Republican senator Scott Wagner VBD constituents in Pennsylvania “ I have n’t been in a NN class in a JJ NN ” – at which point any sensible politician MD have stopped talking – “ but the NNP moves closer to the NN every NN , you VBP , the rotation of the NNP . ” Adding to his alarming heliocentric model , Wagner VBD , “ We have more NNS . You VBP , NNS have warm bodies . So is heat coming off ? Things are changing , but I VBP we are , as a society , doing the best we can . ” Feedback can only speculate that the more researchers we send to the Arctic , the faster it seems to melt . Coincidence ? “ Something smells fishy about Marks & Spencer ’s Coastal Walk scented candle , with its “ fragrance of fresh coastal air ” , VBZ Max Glaskin . “ Maybe it ’s the fact that it is RB “ harmful to aquatic NN ” ” IS NNP spherical , IN a basketball , or JJ IN the NN the game is played on ? The jury is still out for several US sports stars , who voiced their doubts about geosphericism last month ( 1 April ) . “ I thought you ’d VB to VB about the NNP NNP International Conference 2017 , ” writes Bob Lang . “ Apparently delegates will be arriving from IN the NN to VB there . ” Held in North Carolina this November , the NNP Earthers meeting features JJ keynote speakers you MD recognise from rambling NNP videos filled with badly drawn diagrams and the palpable frustration of not being taken seriously . That will end soon though , because the conference has thrown down the gauntlet to the NN of NN . A NNP page headed by a description of the minutiae of “ Satan ’s globe NNP lie ” ( to wit : “ We evolved from primordial soup . We are specks in the universe . Some NNS are more valuable than others . ” ) brings NN that niche imprint Sacred Word Publishing is offering the oddly specific sum of $ 8250 to anyone who can successfully demonstrate that NNP is round , VBG CD original experiments . Yes , NNP MD stand still , but the burden of proof can easily be hoisted onto your opponent ’s shoulders . “ It ca n’t be beyond the wit of Feedback readers to pick up this particular challenge , ” VBZ Bob . And not only will this prove that Satan ’s globe NNP lie is a reality after all , it will demonstrate some NNS RB are worth more than others – specifically , $ 8250 more . TAKING a pragmatic approach to the problem of spelling words out with single letters from the periodic table ( 18 February ) , Andy Ward spies an opportunity . “ The periodic table contains no element beginning with J or Q , ” he VBZ , “ I suggest that when element 119 is made it should be named quasimodium . ” Perhaps an opportunity for researchers at the NNP of Notre Dame in Indiana ? Element 120 , meanwhile , “ should be called janskium after Karl Jansky the radio - astronomer , as it MD appear directly below radium . ” Which MD leave us just CD letters short of an alphabetically complete periodic table , but promisingly , only four short of spelling “ ISLAND OF STABILITY ” . KLEE IRWIN is a NN who made a JJ fortune selling NN supplements such as “ Colon Clear ” , although not as much as he MD have were it not for a 2011 lawsuit that fined his NN $ 2.65 CD for JJ and misleading advertising , plus the JJ matter of selling a supplement that contained 14 times the legal limit of lead . A rehabilitated Irwin has now pivoted into theoretical physics , a field in which fantastical claims with scant supporting NN can still boast a degree of respectability . His Quantum Gravity Research group is seeking to build a JJ , JJ - principles unified NN of everything they call Emergence NNP , “ to unify , through mathematical and scientific rigor , the NN of relativity , quantum mechanics … and consciousness . ” Presumably frozen out by mainstream research funders , Irwin is calling for donations via the Quantum Gravity Group ’s web page – after all , particle colliders do n’t build themselves . But does the NN VB a JJ NN of everything ? The letters inbox at NNP Scientist receives at least CD a week – perhaps it MD do with a dose Colon Clear . TAKEN aback by the creative uses for afterbirth ( 1 April ) , Frank Cross writes to VB “ When I was a lad , the placentas were fed to matron ’s cat . ” This strikes us as both practical and economical . But Feedback is n’t sure that a cat with a taste for JJ flesh is the best pet to have strolling freely IN a maternity ward . JOHN HOW is left puzzling over an NN card attached to his JJ laptop adaptor . “ Electricity travels at 300,000 kilometres per second , ” it tells him . “ If we MD move that fast , we ’d be able to race IN the NN eight times in the NN it takes to turn on a light . ” If we MD move IN the NN that fast , why MD we VB lights anyway ?"

You can read her piece on hell here . My pious Baptist grandmother once shockingly confessed , at the ripe old age of 93 , that she did n’t VB to VB to heaven . “ Why , ” we asked ? “ Well , I VBP it will be rather boring just sitting RB on clouds and singing hymns all day ” she answered . She had a point . Mark Twain might have agreed with her assessment . He once famously quipped that PRP should choose “ heaven for the NN , hell for the NN ” . Most of us have some concept of heaven , RB if it is CD formed by movies IN What Dreams MD Come , The Lovely Bones , or VB it involves meeting Morgan Freeman in a white room . And while not as complicated as biblical ideas about hell , the biblical concept of heaven is not particularly simple either . In the Christian tradition , heaven and paradise have been conflated as an answer to the question “ where do I VB when I die ? ” The idea of the dead being in heaven or enjoying paradise often brings enormous comfort to the bereaved and hope to those suffering or dying . Yet heaven and paradise were originally more about where NNP lived , not about us or our ultimate destination . The words for heaven or heavens in both Hebrew ( shamayim ) and Greek ( ouranos ) can RB be translated as sky . It is not something that exists eternally but rather part of creation . The JJ line of the Bible VBZ that heaven is created along with the creation of the NN ( Genesis 1 ) . It is primarily NNP ’s dwelling place in the biblical tradition : a parallel realm where everything operates according to NNP ’s will . Heaven is a place of peace , love , community , and worship , where NNP is surrounded by a heavenly NN and other heavenly beings . Biblical authors imagined the NN as a JJ place with Sheol below ( the realm of the dead ) and a dome over the NN that separates it from the heavens or sky above . Of course , we VBP the NN is not JJ , and this three - tiered universe makes no sense to a modern NN . RB so , the concept of heaven ( wherever it is located ) continues in Christian theology as the place where NNP dwells and a theological claim that this NN is not all that there is . The other main metaphor for NNP ’s dwelling place in the Bible is paradise . According to Luke ’s version of the crucifixion , Jesus converses with the men on either side of him while waiting to die and promises the NN on a neighbouring cross “ today you will be with me in paradise ” . References to paradise in the Bible are likely due to the influence of Persian culture and particularly Persian Royal gardens ( paridaida ) . Persian walled gardens were VBN for their beautiful layout , diversity of plant NN , walled enclosures , and being a place where the royal family might safely walk . They were effectively a paradise on NN . The garden of Eden in Genesis 2 is strikingly similar to a Persian Royal garden or paradise . It has abundant NN sources in the rivers that run through it , fruit and plants of every kind for food , and it is “ pleasing to the eye ” . NNP dwells there , or at least visits , and talks with Adam and Eve IN a King might in a royal garden . Read more : Friday essay : what might heaven be JJ ? In the grand mythic stories that make up the Bible , NNS are thrown out of Eden due to their disobedience . And so begins a narrative about JJ separation from the divine and how NNS find their NN back to NNP and NNP ’s dwelling ( paradise ) . In the Christian tradition , Jesus is the means of return . The Easter event that Christians celebrate IN the globe at this NN of NN is about the resurrection of Jesus after his violent death on the cross three days earlier . Jesus ’ resurrection is seen as the promise , the “ JJ - fruits ” of what is possible for all NNS – resurrection to an eternal NN with NNP . This is , of course , a matter of faith not something that can be proven . But reconciliation with NNP lies at the heart of the Easter story . The last book of the Bible , Revelation , conflates the idea of heaven and paradise . The author describes a vision of a JJ , re-created heaven coming down to NN . It is not escapism from this NN but rather an affirmation of all that is created , material , and earthly but now healed and renewed . This final biblical vision of heaven is a lot IN the garden of Eden – complete with the Tree of NNP , rivers , plants and NNP – although this NN it is RB an urban , multicultural city . In what is essentially a return to Eden , NNS are reconciled with NNP and , of course , with CD another . Heaven or paradise in the Bible is a utopian vision , designed not only to inspire faith in NNP but RB in the hope that NNS might embody the values of love and reconciliation in this NN ."

Instead of forming a relatively JJ disk , the hundreds of billions of stars that make up the Milky NNP form a disk that 's noticeably twisted at the edges , a bit IN a flattened letter "" S . "" "" I 'd VB that it is shaped IN a Pringle , "" VBD NN co-author Radek Poleski , an astronomer at Ohio NNP NNP in Columbus . For decades , astronomers assumed that the Milky NNP was relatively JJ , IN most other spiral galaxies ( the Milky NNP is a so - called barred spiral galaxy , a whirlpool of stars and interstellar clouds with a bright bar across the middle ) . The JJ research , which was published Aug. 2 in the journal NNP , confirms recent research showing that the galaxy is warped but RB shows that the distortion is more pronounced than astronomers had suspected . The Milky NNP is estimated to have a diameter of just over 100,000 light - NNS , and our solar NN is embedded within it about 25,000 light - NNS from the galaxy 's center . So it 's hard to VB the bend from our vantage point — and vast clouds of interstellar gas and dust within the galaxy make the task RB harder , Poleski VBD . But Poleski and astronomers at the NNP of Warsaw in Poland created a JJ super - detailed map of the Milky NNP VBG so - called variable stars VBN as classical Cepheids , which brighten and dim over a period of days at a rate corresponding to their size . At their brightest , classical Cepheids can be 10,000 brighter than our NN , so they 're visible across vast distances and through the clouds of gas and dust . VBG observational NNS from the Optical Gravitational Lens Experiment ( OGLE ) , an ongoing survey of stars in the southern sky made VBG a specialized telescope in Chile 's Atacama Desert , the astronomers determined accurate positions for more than 2,400 classical Cepheid stars by comparing the light they were VBN to produce with the light from them seen here on NNP . "" When we measure the period of a star , we VBP how much absolute light it emits , "" Poleski VBD . "" Then we can compare it with the light that we are getting , and by comparing those CD we VBP the distance . "" What explains our galaxy 's weird shape ? Richard de Grijs , an astronomer at MacQuarrie NNP in Sydney , Australia , attributed it to the effects of gravitational interactions with neighboring galaxies . It 's RB possible that our galaxy twisted as it merged with smaller galaxies in the distant past , he VBD , or that its warped shape is the result of the combined gravity of the spiral arms themselves , which MD pull stars and clouds at the edges away from the JJ plane of the rest of the galaxy . De Grijs , who was part of a team who measured the galaxy 's bend in research published earlier this NN , VBD the JJ NN confirmed and expanded upon the earlier research .

See_VB TIME_NNP 's_POS Pictures_NNPS of_IN the_DT Week_NNP ._.",""" Lights All Askew in the Heavens , "" proclaimed a headline in the NNP NNP Times on Nov. CD , 1919 . The reason : results had just come in from the very JJ test of Albert Einstein 's JJ general NN of relativity . "" Men of NN More or Less Agog over Results of Eclipse Observations , "" the headline continued , in what passed for breathless excitement back then . The key NN that had the NNS so giddy was Einstein 's claim that NN and NN were elastic , and MD be warped and stretched IN taffy . The test that proved it involved observing stars whose position in the sky makes them appear to be close to the NN and measuring whether solar gravity warped NN - NN enough to distort the starlight slightly . A 1919 solar eclipse allowed NNS to VB the stars clearly and make the necessary measurements  proving that the great NN 's NNS were correct . You might VB that when a scientific finding has n't been seriously challenged for 93 NNS the matter MD be pretty much settled , but experimentalists have been poking and prodding Einstein 's premises ever since . There 's more than just stubborn skepticism at work : some of relativity 's more esoteric implications are fiendishly hard to confirm , so the physicists keep devising more and more sensitive and difficult studies  RB though the NN keeps passing them all . Which explains a recent announcement out of NNP headquarters . After no fewer than seven cancellations , followed by seven reprieves , the NN agency 's orbiting Gravity Probe B mission , or GP - B for short , has at last confirmed not CD , but CD of relativity 's more subtle predictions  and it took only 51 NNS and three - quarters of a CD dollars to do it . To understand what the probe VBD , you RB VBP to VB about NN - NN , the four - dimensional stage on which everything in the universe plays out . What we VBP of as gravity , Einstein VBD , is n't a force that pulls CD objects toward each other . Rather , it 's a warping of NN - NN itself that makes objects VB to move . The classic real - NN analogy is a bowling ball on a trampoline : the ball makes the trampoline 's NN dip . That 's something vaguely IN the NN a star or a NN makes NN - NN warp . The JJ difference is that NN - NN is n't a JJ NN , but something that fills the universe . This makes the warping pretty much impossible to visualize , RB for physicists , so do n't try . In any NN , if you roll a marble close to the bowling ball , it will naturally fall into the depression  just as a passing meteorite falls to NNP . That 's part CD . Part CD is that since the bowling ball represents NNP , it is n't just sitting but spinning , which makes the NN of the trampoline twist a little in the direction of the spin . The same goes for the NN - NN surrounding our spinning NN . What GP - B did was to measure both the dip and the twist . The spacecraft managed that impressive feat by carrying four of the most perfect gyroscopes ever built  actually , they 're superconducting balls of niobium  into orbit IN NN NNP while the ship itself pointed unerringly at the star IM Pegasi for 17 months , starting in 2004 . The balls , meanwhile , floated independently inside , supported only by magnetic fields . If the gyroscopes kept the same orientation as the spacecraft that bore them , Einstein MD have been refuted . But they wandered a bit , meaning the satellite was flying through gently twisted NN . Relativity had come through once again . It took NNS to figure that out , though , because the experiment turned out to be flawed . Patches of electric charge had built up on the NN of the balls , adding an extra force that proved extremely tricky to unravel . And RB when the physicists had done so , they VBD they MD measure the dip in NN - NN only to an accuracy of 1 % , and the twist , formally VBN as frame dragging , to a flabby CD % . In the half - century since GP - B was RB proposed , moreover , other physicists have confirmed both effects . "" I have to compliment the Gravity Probe B team for their result because Gravity Probe B is a very difficult and very beautiful experiment , "" the Italian physicist Ignazio Ciufolini VBD the website ScienceNOW . He was clearly being polite , considering that his own LAGEOS satellite measured frame dragging with higher precision a few NNS ago . LAGEOS and the other experiments that yielded similar findings were n't necessarily cheap , but they did n't cost $ 750 CD either  a NN that RB NNP was finally unable to afford . It backed away from funding the last stages of the project , relying on a Saudi scientist to kick in the final few CD . So was Gravity Probe B worth it ? To hear GP - B NNS tell it , the experiment was a resounding success . But in order to justify that judgment in the face of the high cost , slow progress and imprecise results , they knew they MD n't simply invoke Einstein . Instead , they RB felt the NN to point out that NNS who had worked on GP - B as grad students had gone on to do important things ( Sally Ride became the JJ JJ woman in NN ! ) , and that the technology developed for GP - B had widespread applications  including , VB it or not , GPS systems that now VBP farmers plant very straight rows of corn . For anyone familiar with the NNP press office , this is n't a huge vote of confidence . If you VBP agriculture to justify a fundamental physics experiment , you 're clearly feeling a little desperate . And with sharply declining budgets , better corn rows wo n't likely persuade the agency to spring for more JJ - ticket tests of general relativity . But NN for such studies did n't seem to be forthcoming anyway . Just last month , NNP announced it was backing out of a proposed NN mission called the Laser Interferometer NNP Antenna , designed to look for gravitational waves  yet another of relativity 's strange predictions . It MD be a while , in other words , before men of NN  and the women who RB since broke into that once exclusive club  VB to be more or less agog again . VB NNP 's Pictures of the Week ."

In it , he cited three differences between 2005 and 1968 . • Todays 18 - 21 NN olds are not worried about being drafted . • The opposition to this NN that does exist is not part of any larger cultural NN . Now , we hear that the Army and Marine Corps are having trouble meeting their recruiting goals . We are witnessing an anti-war movement of a JJ type . I cannot remember either of the parties to this story , but I will tell it anyway . Someone once VBD of a famous philosopher , that he loved humanity , but he hated NNS . He cared deeply about humanity in the abstract , but he was frustrated unmercifully by the unwillingness of NNS to behave in accordance with his ideals . Oh , if it werent for those pesky , inconvenient NNS ! We Americans love to talk about NN . JJ of us cheerlead for perpetual NN . We stand behind our NN and our troops . We brand anyone who criticizes our JJ policies as liberal , communist , pro-terror and a lover of NNP - Qaeda . We always speak in the JJ person when promoting NN . (  We ought to bomb the crap out of this country and we ought to pulverize that country ! ) But we never VBP to talk about what actually happens in NN . For a refresher , let me recommend the JJ 20 minutes of . Talking to CD segment of NNP about NN is IN talking to another segment of NNP about abortion . Heaven forbid that we actually VBP fight it ourselves . We deride John Kerry , Ted Kennedy and other limousine liberals  for not parting with their wealth while they tax the rest of us into poverty . Yet , JJ of the most vocal NN hawks in the executive branch , in congress and in the NN have never lifted a finger to serve CD day in the NN . The same goes for JJ of these same NN hawks at work , at church and in your neighborhood . I cannot speak for NNS half my age . However , I am VBG to put myself in the NNS of a CD - NN - old looking at his options , with the NN being CD of them . Iraq never attacked us . They never threatened to attack us . If they had attacked us we MD have whipped them good . They never had the means to do so anyway . There were no WMDs . We got Saddam . They have had their NN . And now , they are so busy fighting among themselves that they arent about to attack anyone . Why are we RB over there ? If some other country comes and invades , then I will VB fight . Gladly ! But , I am not VBG to VB my NN in Iraq . He speaks for the anti-war movement of 2005 . Youll note no JJ commentary here . No ulterior motives . He just is not willing to be meat on the hoof when he sees no threat to himself or his country . Who can blame him ? In 1993 , someone VBD Hillary NNP that the costs imposed by her husbands national NN care proposal MD put a lot of JJ business out of business . She responded that it was not ( her ) job to VB out and save every undercapitalized businessman in NNP .  Conservative commentators rightfully compared her arrogance to that of Marie Antoinette . When someone asked Vice NNP Cheney why he never served in the NN , he answered ,  I had other priorities .  These same commentators ought to be similarly indignant about his arrogance . There is a black wall in NNP , DC , with 58,000 names on it . JJ of these NNS had other priorities  as well . NN is easy to talk about and easy to be self - righteous about . However , it has consequences . This is nt the hood . This is not the South Bronx , South Central Los Angeles or Five Points here in Denver . This is NN !!! To quote the Talking Heads , "" This ai n't no party . This ai n't no disco . This ai n't no fooling RB . "" Chuck Baldwin , another CD of my internet punditry faves , recently wrote eloquently of the scourge of NN :  To those who are engaged in NN , the consequences can be nightmarish ! Arms and legs cut off . Eyes put out . Flesh burned . Intestines ripped out . Backs broken . Skulls crushed . Lives lost . Families torn apart . Homes destroyed . NNS left without NNS . NNS never able to VB their NNS again . Wives without husbands . Husbands without wives . Souls snuffed into eternity . Emotional scars that never heal . These are the realities of NN . And this is what the neo-cons who profit from NN never have to VB up close and personal .  Instead , pro-war neo-cons sit in their comfortable , air - conditioned offices and send other husbands , other wives , other NNS , other NNS , other NNS to incur the "" scourge "" of NN . But the neo-cons who trumpet NN , who promote NN , and who finance NN never actually experience NN .  This is NNP . You can have whatever opinion you VBP . If you VBP to VB the NN is JJ or worship Mungabunga , VB ahead . However , it does not mean your opinion has any worth . You can support perpetual NN all you VBP , but if you yourself have never served , your opinion is of no interest to me . If you feel threatened by some fourth - rate , tin pot , Third NN potentate , fight him yourself . The late Pat Tillman gave up a pro football career to become and Army Ranger . Colorado NNP Treasurer Mike Coffman , a retired Marine reservist , took a leave of absence to rejoin the Corps in Iraq . So why dont you drop what you re doing , head to Baghdad and bust a few caps ? Yeah you , Rambo ! The NNP of Northern Aggression ( 1861 -1865 ) was once ridiculed as a rich mans NN and a poor mans fight . It was easy to talk about it , but hard to find NNS to fight it . Indeed , the worst riots in JJ history were the 1863 anti-draft riots in NNP NNP City . Before you whine about France not joining us in Iraq and before you VBP a word about the need  for a draft , do it yourself ! Why is it  wimping out "" only when Ill VB CD thing about the draft dodgers in Vietnam : they had the courage to act on their convictions . Ill VB CD thing and CD thing only on behalf of John Kerry : he was in harms NN for four and a half months during  Nam . I VBP a great place where the NN can find tons and tons of fresh meat to be ground pounders in whatever NN is next . They VBP to put recruiters in the evangelical churches in this country and VB how JJ folks actually enlist . Each Sunday , they MD set up tables in the lobby . The pastors shouldnt have a problem with this . Come on , now ! Raise your hand ! Swear that oath ! Sign that paper ! Ship out and destroy some country in order to save it . It s your Christian duty ! Dude , this is a jihad for Jesus . I VBP it is VBN on the book of Jebediah or Pauls letter to the Estonians . If you are too old , or for some other reason not qualified to join the NN , form your own expeditionary force . Call it the Sword of the Lord . There are precedents of Americans volunteering to fight in other NNS for causes they support . It is easy to talk about your Great Christian NNP and to praise his wars as doing Gods work IN the globe . It is easy to have a yellow ribbon and a W04 bumper sticker on your car . It is , as they VBP , a whole nother thing to support his policies by participating in them . If you wish to post this or link to this , please include the URL as well as my e-mail address ."

"" He worked all night , every night — catching a few hours ' sleep when he MD . He had his Winnebago trailer set up to screen films , and he was always running 2001 , and when he got tired of that , he MD run cartoons . "" null Truffaut , the French director whom Spielberg persuaded to act in the film , was RB dazzled by Spielberg 's stamina — though he was somewhat baffled by the movie itself . "" I never RB tried to figure out what my role meant , "" he VBZ . "" I VBP I was there a lot , but IN Greta Garbo , I can VB only that I had the feeling of waiting . "" There were a few incidents of unexpected — and largely unwanted — excitement . Star Richard Dreyfuss , after criticizing the Ku Klux Klan in an Alabama newspaper interview , received a death threat and had to be whisked away for CD weeks . Dillon 's son received a kidnaping threat that brought in the FBI . Then , late CD night , shooting halted abruptly so that everyone MD observe what Spielberg believed to be a UFO cruising the sky . "" Everyone was lying there on their backs with binoculars , "" VBZ Dillon . "" I remember thinking that if there were extraterrestrial beings up there observing us , they MD VB that NN creatures were JJ beings with strange eyes . "" The object turned out to be an Echo satellite . Despite Spielberg 's preoccupation with UFOs in Close Encounters , he prefers to call the film an "" adventure thriller "" rather than NN fiction , and he MD have a point . The movie 's conception is pure Hitchcock — on an intergalactic scale . The hero , Roy Neary ( Dreyfuss ) , is a Middle JJ variant on the kind of NN - in - the - middle played by Gary Grant and James Stewart in films IN North by Northwest and Vertigo . A NN - NN worker who lives with his wife ( Teri Garr ) and three kids in Muncie , Ind. , Roy is engulfed CD night by phenomena he cannot understand : searing lights burn him from above , a road sign shakes and twists , the contents of his truck move about in violent defiance of gravity , the needles on his dashboard dials spin past VB . Roy is sure that he has had an encounter with alien NN forms — but , of course , no NN will VB his story . The rest of Close Encounters ' plot follows Roy and several other UFO sighters , including a mysterious international scientist ( Truffaut ) and a neighborhood woman ( Dillon ) , as they overturn their lives in a mad attempt to arrange a rendezvous with the extraterrestrial visitors . When an earthling makes actual contact with aliens , that is "" a close encounter of the third kind . "" ( The JJ kind is sighting ; the second , physical NN . )"

"" — James 2:10 Who 's the biggest sinner ? I am ! You are ! We all are ! WE HAVE SINNED ! Put down your stones you self - righteous hypocrites ! It is JJ nature to look upon the sins and faults of others , while often overlooking our own sins . This is hypocrisy . CD of the worst deceptions is overlooking our own faults . The Word of NNP proclaims in James 2:10 that committing RB CD SIN makes a person GUILTY in NNP 's eyes of breaking every command in the Bible . James 2:10 , “ For whosoever shall keep the whole law , and yet offend in CD point , he is guilty of all . ” This is a startling doctrine that is hardly touched upon in churches today . If you are a Christian the whole NN is waiting for you to fall . Sermon uploads that MD VB lives are fortunate to receive RB a hundred hits , but you upload some juicy gossip about a preacher sinning and millions of NNS VBP to VB it . This evidences the hypocrisy and desperate wickedness of the JJ heart , just as Jeremiah 17:9 VBZ , “ The heart is deceitful above all things , and desperately wicked : who can VB it ? ” If you are truly JJ with NNP , then you VBP yourself as the biggest sinner , because you VBP yourself better than anyone . Do you VB what a hypocrite is Biblically ? It is a person who thinks that someone else is a bigger sinner than them self . Here is a precious MP3 sermon by Pastor Jack Hyles titled , “ Chief Of Sinners . ” No real Christian claims to be less a sinner than others ! There is no teaching in the Bible that VBZ Christians are less sinful than unsaved NNS . The only difference is that we as believers have the Holy Spirit indwelling our bodies . As separated Christians , we must never accept the sin with the sinner , nor should we ever reject the sinner with the sin . We ought to love everybody with NNP 's unconditional love through the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ . Did you VB that the divorce rate amongst professed Christians is equal to that of the heathen unsaved NN ? This is because Christians VBP the same NN as the heathen NN . Romans 12:2 exhorts Christians not to be conformed , that is , fashioned , according to this present NN . Divorce is always worldly , never Christian . In filing for divorce , a person is saying : “ My spouse is a bigger sinner than I am ; therefore , I have a NN to abandon , quit and break my marriage vows . ” No you do n't ! Divorce is a horrible sin rooted in PRP 's own hypocritical self - righteousness . The Bible teaches that we are all as guilty as the vilest sinner in NNP 's eyes . This doctrine is virtually unheard of nowadays , because few preachers stress the Law of NNP anymore , which condemns all of us as guilty sinners before NNP ... Now we VBP that what things soever the law saith , it saith to them who are under the law : that every mouth MD be stopped , and all the NN MD become guilty before NNP ” ( Romans 3:19 ) . In the eyes of men , murdering someone is obviously worse than stealing their lunch ; but as far as NNP is concerned we are all equally lacking any righteousness of our own . We are each as dirty and rotten as the other guy . Oftentimes what NNS perceive as acceptable , such as homosexuality , is an abomination unto NNP . If we SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES as Jesus commanded in John 5:39 , then we can only come to the conclusion that we are as sinful as the worst sinner in NNP 's eyes and it matters not who is more guilty . We are all guilty ( Romans 3:10,23 ) . The fact of the matter is that we are all sinners deserving of punishment in Hell ( Romans 6:23 ; Revelation 20:11 - 15 ) . Although we MD never commit murder or rob a bank , that does make us any less guilty of being a horrible sinner in the eyes of NNP . “ If we MD ever hate the sin in ourselves as much as we hate the sin in others , we might have some idea what His Book is all about . ” — Pastor Jack Hyles ( a quote from page 322 of the awesome biography of Dr. Hyles titled , “ The Fundamental NNP ” ) MD I VB , no matter how righteous I MD try to live , the ONLY reason why I will ever be righteous is because of the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ . Jesus paid my sin debt , and He alone is my righteousness . I have no righteousness to offer NNP , and neither do you . NNS tend to selfishly judge themselves VBN upon what sins they personally DON'T commit . Did you understand that ? NNS who do n't commit adultery are quick to condemn others who commit adultery , because that 's not their sin . But perhaps they are a thief for a living , and so they are silent when it comes to the sin of theft . This is how shallow , wicked and hypocritical most NNS are . The Bible perfectly illustrates this in Jesus ' account of the Pharisee and the publican who went up to the temple to pray ... “ CD men went up into the temple to pray ; the CD a Pharisee , and the other a publican . The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , NNP , I thank thee , that I am not as other men are , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or RB as this publican . I fast twice in the week , I give tithes of all that I possess . And the publican , standing afar off , MD not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven , but smote upon his breast , saying , NNP be merciful to me a sinner . I tell you , this NN went down to his NN justified rather than the other : for every NN that exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted ” ( Luke 18:10 - 14 ) . The Pharisee in Luke 18:10 - 14 made the grave mistake of comparing himself with other NNS , instead of measuring himself up against the holy Law of NNP . If we foolishly look at other NNS who commit the sins that we do n't , or sins that we perceive as being worse than our sins , then we naturally become self - righteousness and VBP we are “ better ” than others . I tell you , you are as filthy and rotten as Adolf Hitler in NNP 's eyes , and so am I ... “ But we are all as an unclean thing , and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags ; and we all do fade as a leaf ; and our iniquities , IN the wind , have taken us away ” ( Isaiah 64:6 ) . Reproach For Sins Comes Now Or Later The Bible teaches that some NNS 's sins are open ( VBN ) beforehand here on NN . But the Bible teaches that everyone else 's sins will follow them and be revealed in eternity , causing shame and reproach ... 5:24 , “ Some men 's sins are open beforehand , VBG before to judgment ; and some men they follow after . ” When the truth is VBN , ALL NNS will be exposed as wicked and shameful sinners . When asked to give the name of the worst and most horrible sinners we VBP , most NNS tend to VB of NNS besides them self . This is the hypocritical nature of humanity . This is why all gossip is sinful and wrong , that is , because we are just as sinful as the person that we criticize . Hey , let 's talk about our selves instead . All of a sudden no NN has anything to VB ? Perhaps we have never commit a particular sin per se , but we ought not to judge others simply because they sin differently than we do . Mankind is inherently sinful and has NO self - righteousness to offer NNP . RB committing CD sin is enough to be damned to the Lake of Fire forever ( Revelation 20:11 - 15 ) . That 's the reason why NNP sent His only begotten Son , Jesus Christ , to die on the cross of Calvary , shedding His precious NN to pay for our sins . NNP 's Law indicts all humanity as guilty sinners ( Romans 3:19 ) . 1st Timothy 5:24 VBZ that some men's sins are open to criticism and judgment beforehand , but everyone else 's sins will be made VBN eventually on judgment day . NO CD is VBG to retain their dignity and honor on judgment day as a self - righteous person who did n't do anything shameful , disgraceful or surprising . The Bible declares that ALL men have come short of the glory of NNP ( Romans 3:23 ) . The Bible teaches that the Pharisees who condemned others were the guiltiest of all sinners ( Matthew 7:1 - 5 ) . The reason why hypocrites throw rocks at others is because they are proud , arrogant and saturated with sins them self . Those hypocrites who condemn others for their sins will CD day be silenced completely in eternity when THEIR SINS are revealed . Christians who realize their own sinfulness DON'T condemn other NNS when they sin . Slanderers and critics of sinners are self - righteous , FAILING to VB their own depth of sin and evil . Most NNS have absolutely no idea how sinful they RB are in comparison to the holy Bible . You and I are dirty , rotten , guilty , sinners in NNP 's eyes . Therefore , we had all better VB twice before we decide to throw rocks at other NNS who sin , denouncing them as evil , and taking delight in their calamity . Our day of reckoning is RB coming ! So before you look down in disdain upon someone else who has sinned horribly , you had better consider your own horrible sins in NNP 's eyes , because the Lord will judge us according to how we judge others ... Matthew 7:1 - 3 , “ Judge not , that ye be not judged . For with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you again . And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother 's eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ? ” RB the best Christians still have a mote ( tiny piece ) in their eye , meaning that we are all sinners ; but those evil critics who spread gossip , tell tales , condemn others , reveal secrets and hypocritically destroy their neighbor with their mouth have a beam ( JJ piece ) in their eye . NNP 's harshest judgment is reserved for those arrogant sinners who condemn other sinners , overlooking their own wickedness in hypocrisy while trying to destroy the good name of others . If the truth be VBN , we all have a skeleton closet of sins . The Bible VBZ that a person is calling NNP a liar if they deny their sinfulness ( 1st John 1:8,10 ) . We are living in an evil generation that tolerates all manner of sin and wickedness from Hollywood , rock music stars , and their favorite immoral professional athletes ; yet , the NN is waiting for every Christian to fall JJ . Jesus taught in John 15:19 not to marvel if the NN hates us as Christians , because the NN hated Him RB . 2nd Timothy 3:12 foretold that those faithful Christians who live godly in Christ Jesus SHALL SUFFER PERSECUTION . The NN hates the Bible and Christians who uphold the truths of the Bible . MD to NNP that Christians in churches today MD stop saying , “ he has sinned , ” and “ she has sinned , ” and that we'd all start saying , “ we have sinned . ” It is sinful pride that causes a wife to publicly criticize or divorce her husband . It is sinful pride that causes the manure - spreading newsmedia to mercilessly destroy NNS 's lives . It is sinful pride that causes NNS to broadcast their parent 's dirty laundry to others . It is sinful pride that causes self - righteous hypocrites to meddle in other NNS 's marriages . I came to the realization CD day as a believer that I am as rotten and sinful as the worst sinner . I am just as sinful as any adulterer , mass - murderer , homosexual , thief , liar or Satan worshipper . AND SO ARE YOU ! Our sins are just as woeful and wrong . We have no room to condemn . This is a faithful saying , and worthy of all acceptation , that Christ Jesus came into the NN to save sinners ; of whom I am chief ” ( 1st Timothy 1:15 ) . The Apostle Paul was a faithful missionary who loved the Lord Jesus Christ and helped NNS everywhere he went . Paul suffered horribly from shipwreck , hunger , turmoil and malicious beatings from his enemies ; yet he kept VBG for NNP . Paul was a mighty preacher and a strong Christian . Although Paul was arguably the greatest missionary who ever lived , he still addressed himself as the “ chief of sinners . ” I do n't VB too JJ believers today who are anywhere near as dedicated and committed to Jesus Christ as was Paul . If a good Christian IN Paul esteemed himself as the “ chief of sinners , ” then we ought to feel the same NN . We must distinguish between condemning someone for their sins versus publicly exposing them because they are a threat to society . I publicly expose abortionists ( murderers ) , homosexuals ( sex perverts ) and religious deceivers ( liars ) through my JJ ministry ; but I do not condemn any of them personally . I am not condemning them ; NNP 's Word condemns all of us ( Romans 3:19 - 23 ) . I am as rotten and sinful as the worst sinner . I am not self - righteous ; I am trusting upon HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS , i.e. , the righteousness of Jesus Christ ( 2nd Corinthians 5:21 ) . I deserve to burn in Hell and there 's absolutely nothing good about me except the Lord Jesus Christ Who lives in my heart , thankfully . If a local school has a teacher who is teaching teens how to have homosexual “ fist sex , ” which is happening today in Massachusetts , then that evil person needs to be exposed . Godless heathens are quick to cry out , “ Jesus VBD , ' judge not lest ye be not judged . ' ” They conveniently fail to quote John 7:24 where Jesus stated , “ Judge not according to the appearance , but judge righteous judgment . ” So we are supposed to judge , but rightfully so . Ephesians 5:10 - 11 reads , “ Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord . And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather reprove them . ” The word “ proving ” in Ephesians 5:10 is the Greek word ( dokimazo ) and means “ to test . ” Thus , NNP wants us to test everything , to judge righteously , to discern whether or not something is acceptable to Him , i.e. , in agreement with His holy Word . Certainly , it is NOT acceptable to teach NNS that it's ok for Timmy to stick his fist in Johnny 's backside as an expression of love . We are living in a sicko society in NNP . Ephesians 5:11 commands God-fearing believers to reprove [ Greek : elencho , i.e. , “ to expose ” ] all works of darkness . This is not condemning ; but rather , judging righteously as we are supposed to do . MD to NNP that more believers today MD realize the extent of their wickedness in the eyes of NNP . We are a sorry bunch . Our only hope is the precious Lord Jesus Christ and the salvation that He freely offers to us , paid for by His own shed NN ... Forasmuch as ye VBP that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things , as silver and gold , from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers ; But with the precious NN of Christ , as of a lamb without blemish and without spot ” ( 1st Peter 1:18,19 ) . If it were n't for the literal precious NN of Jesus Christ , we 'd all be doomed to the Lake of Fire . NNP is a good NNP ... “ But NNP commendeth his love toward us , in that , while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us CD day I had preached a rip - snortin ' , shingle - pullin ' , window - rattlin ' , hell - fire and damnation sermon to a group of about 80 NNS in Chicago . After the sermon I stepped outside for some fresh air . I glanced over and noticed a gentleman smoking . He felt embarrassed and VBD , “ I 'm sorry reverend for smoking in front of you . I replied , “ I preach against sin from the pulpit ; but away from the pulpit I 'm just as much a sinner as anyone else . You 're in good NN friend . You VBP not apologize . He had wrongly esteemed that he was a bigger sinner than me ; but I am the biggest sinner I VBP . If you VBP to VB the biggest sinner , then just look in the mirror . You and I are as guilty of sin as anyone else . Job 20:4 - 5 , “ Knowest thou not this of old , since NN was placed upon NN , That the triumphing of the wicked is short , and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment ? ” Ye Must Be Born Again ! | You VBP HIS Righteousness !"

For example , during a closing operation , CD phases of a circuit - breaker MD close and latch successfully but not the third phase , or , during an opening operation , CD phases MD properly open but the third remains stuck in the closed position . Except on mainly underground systems , the vast majority of short - circuit faults are NN - related , followed by equipment failure . The NN factors that usually VBP short - circuit faults are : lightning strikes , accumulation of snow or NN , heavy rain , strong winds or gales , salt pollution depositing on insulators on overhead lines and in substations , floods and fires adjacent to electrical equipment , for example , beneath overhead lines . Vandalism MD RB be a NN of short - circuit faults as well as contact with or breach of minimum clearances between overhead lines and trees due to current overload . Lightning strikes discharge steep - fronted impulse currents with peak values in the range of a few kiloamps up to 100 or 200 kA for a duration of several microseconds . If the strike hits an overhead line or its NN wire , the voltage produced across the insulator MD be so JJ that a back - flashover and short circuit occurs . This MD involve CD or all three phases of a three - phase electrical circuit and as a result a transient NN frequency short - circuit current flows . For example , consider a 132 - kV three - phase overhead transmission line of steel tower construction and CD NN wire . The surge impedances of the tower , line phase conductors and NN wire are given as 220 , 350 and 400 Ω , respectively , and the tower ’s earthing or footing resistance is 50 Ω . The line ’s rated lightning impulse withstand voltage to NN is 650 kV peak phase to NN ( nominal peak phase to NN voltage is ) . A lightning strike with a modest peak current of CD kA hits a tower on the line and , to a reasonable approximation , ‘ sees ’ half the surge impedance of the NN wire in parallel with the surge impedance of the tower . The voltage produced across the line ’s insulator is approximately equal to CD kA×105 Ω=1050 kV . This significantly exceeds the line ’s insulation strength , causes back - flashover on all three phases of the line and a three - phase to NN short - circuit fault . If the shielding of the NN wire fails and the lightning strike hits CD of the phase conductors near a tower , then the voltage produced across the line ’s insulator is approximately equal to CD kA ×175 Ω=1750 kV . In this NN , a smaller lightning current in the order of 3.8 kA MD be sufficient to VB a back - flashover and hence a short - circuit fault . On lower - voltage distribution lines , RB ‘ indirect ’ lightning strikes , that is , those that hit nearby objects to the line MD produce a sufficiently JJ voltage on the line to VB an insulator flashover and a short - circuit fault . Other causes of short - circuit faults are fires . The smoke of fires beneath overhead lines consists of JJ particles which encourage the breakdown of the air that is subjected to the intense electric field of a high - voltage NN line . The hot air in the flames of a fire has a much lower insulation strength than air at ambient NN . A flashover across an insulator to NN or from a phase conductor to a tree MD occur . Equipment failure of machines , transformers , reactors , cables , etc. , causes JJ short - circuit faults . These MD be caused by failure of internal insulation due to ageing and degradation , breakdown due to high switching or lightning over - voltages , by mechanical incidents or by inappropriate installation . An example is a breakdown of a cable ’s polymer insulation due to ageing or the creation of voids within the insulation caused by an external mechanical force being accidentally applied on the cable . Short - circuit faults MD RB be caused by JJ error . A classical example is CD where maintenance staff inadvertently leave isolated equipment connected through safety NN clamps when maintenance work is completed . A three - phase to NN short - circuit fault occurs when the equipment is re-energised to return it to service . On mainly overhead line systems , the majority of short - circuit faults , typically 80 % –90 % , tend to occur on overhead lines and the rest on cables , substation equipment and busbars combined . Typically , on a high - voltage transmission NN with overhead line steel tower construction , such as the England and Wales transmission NN , JJ - term average short - circuit fault statistics show that RB 300 short - circuit faults occur per annum . Of these , 67 % are CD - phase to NN , 25 % are phase to phase , 5 % are three - phase to NN and three - phase clear of NN , and 3 % are CD - phase to NN . About 77 % of CD - phase to NN faults are caused by lightning strikes followed by wind and gales then salt pollution on insulators . Although lightning can VB some phase - to - phase faults , by far the most common causes of these faults are snow / NN followed by wind / gales that VBP CD line conductors to clash . The majority of three - phase to NN and CD - phase to NN faults in England and Wales are caused by lightning then wind and gales . On wood - pole overhead lines , for example , some 132 kV and lower voltages in England and Wales , between 50 % and 67 % of short - circuit faults are CD - phase and three - phase faults ."

This is only partly JJ . The NN does pull on ocean NN , but that tug at any CD point is about CD CD times weaker than NNP 's gravity . It 's RB the interplay of gravity between the NN , NNP , and NN that creates a tidal force , and it 's more of a "" push "" than a "" pull . "" Each molecule of NN is pulled by the NN 's gravity , but alone that acceleration is so weak it is n't noticeable . Because ocean NN covers about 71 % of NNP 's NN and is connected as CD liquid body , however , all of those tiny tugs add up to form a significant pressure — the tidal force . Molecules of NN near the poles are pulled mostly straight down , those on the face of NNP closest to the NN experience the strongest pull toward the NN , and those on the opposite side of NNP feel the weakest acceleration . Together , these interactions form a pressure on seawater that generally directs it away from the poles and toward the equator , where it 's strong enough to fight gravity to form CD bulges : the high tides . Tides follow the NN as it orbits NNP every 28 days , but it 's not as simple as that . NN sloshes RB , just as it does within in aquarium , and the shape of the seafloor , the position of the coasts , and the Coriolis effect ( caused by NNP 's rotation ) affect where and to what extent tides occur — resulting in a complex pattern of "" tidal nodes . "" "" NNP rotates so quickly that the tide NN wave can't move IN the NNP quickly enough , "" Ted Swift , an JJ scientist who works for the NN of California , VBD Business Insider in an email . "" What we VBP as tides on the coast are resonances — rotating standing waves — set up by the fundamental tidal potential ' signal . ' "" Smaller bodies of NN , IN lakes and pools , do n't have noticeable tides because they lack enough liquid to create a pressure that can visibly overcome the pull of NNP 's gravity . The NN 's gravity RB affects the tides , accounting for roughly CD - third of the phenomenon . When the NN 's gravity counteracts the NN 's , it leads to lower - than - average "" neap tides . "" When the NN lines up with the NN , it triggers larger "" spring tides . "" Correction : An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the nature of tides ."

Xinhua NN agency reported that a NNP March 3B rocket carrying the Chang 'e - 4 lunar probe took off from the country 's southwestern Xichang launch center at 2:23 a.m. local NN ( 1823 UTC ) . The rover is scheduled to land on the NN and begin conducting experiments and survey work by the end of December . The experiments , six of which are Chinese , include analyzing minerals and measuring radiation . The synchronicity of the NN and NN 's rotations ensures that the far side of the NN is always facing away from the NN , a phenomenon VBN as "" tidal locking . "" The Soviet Union captured the JJ images of the far side in 1959 . The far side 's cratered NN will make the probe 's planned "" soft "" landing far more challenging than previous landings on the near side , which has JJ JJ areas . Because signals cannot travel in a straight line between the NN and the NN 's far side , NNP launched the Queqiao ( "" Magpie Bridge "" ) relay satellite into the NN 's orbit in NNP . The Chang'e mission , named after the NN goddess in Chinese mythology , follows NNP 's JJ mission to the NN , the Yutu ( "" Jade Rabbit "" ) probe , in 2013 . Next NN , Beijing plans to launch the Chang 'e - 5 lunar lander to collect and return samples from the lunar NN . If successful , it MD be the JJ NN samples have returned to NN since 1976 .

On his return to NNP , he finds his daughter older than himself : she is an elderly lady , he is still middle - aged . This is not Hollywood fantasy , it is how the NN truly works . The film ’s scientific consultant Kip Thorne has since received the Nobel Prize in physics , for his role in detecting the gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes . He knows his topic . If we do not experience similar NN distortions in our daily NN , it is only because here on NNP they are too JJ for us to notice . It is not the JJ NN NN has shown our intuitions to be mistaken . NN is constantly learning something JJ , and more often than not such learning means jettisoning wrong ideas . That is why NN often clashes with common sense — our intuition wants NNP to be JJ and still , and NN to be the same everywhere . None of this is JJ . NN is a mystery that has always troubled us , stirring deep emotions . Perhaps it is because , as Buddha put it , our difficulty in dealing with impermanence ( or the passage of NN ) is at the root of our suffering . Hans Reichenbach , in CD of the most lucid books on the matter , The Direction of NNP , suggested that it might have been in order to escape from this anxiety that the Greek philosopher Parmenides denied NN ’s existence , Plato imagined a NN of ideas outside it and Hegel spoke of the moment in which the spirit transcends temporality . It MD be because of this that we have imagined the existence of “ eternity ” , a NN outside NN that we imagine inhabited by gods , a NNP or immortal souls . Our deeply emotional attitude towards the subject MD have contributed more to the construction of cathedrals of philosophy than logic or reason did . The opposite emotional attitude — the veneration of NN by thinkers such as Heraclitus or Henri Bergson — has given rise to just as JJ philosophies but still not brought us much nearer to understanding its reality . Physics helps us to penetrate some layers of the mystery . But our grasp of the NN is shaped by the vast dialogue that involves the whole of our culture , from physics to philosophy , literature to the neuro - sciences . All these crafts MD be needed here . Physics has conclusively shown that the temporal structure of the NN is JJ from our perception of it . It has given us the hope of being able to VB the nature of NN free from our emotional fog . But in advancing towards quantum NNS of gravity with a temporal structure far removed from our intuition , we end up losing our own sense of NN . Just as Copernicus , by studying the revolutions of the heavens , ended up understanding that it is us rather than the sky that turns , exploring the nature of NN leads us to discover something about ourselves . Perhaps , ultimately , the emotional dimension of NN is not the film of mist that prevents us from apprehending its nature objectively . Perhaps the emotion of NN is precisely what NN is for us . The uniform nature of NN is scarcely the only feature where our intuition has turned out to be mistaken . To everybody ’s surprise , the difference between past and future fails to show up in the elementary equations that govern the physical NN . But the discovery that has been the most disconcerting of all has been finding out that the notion of “ present ” does not make sense in the larger universe ; it only makes sense in the vicinity of us slow JJ critters . “ Here - and - now ” is a well - defined notion in NN , but “ now ” on its own is not . Philosophers are struggling greatly with this discovery : if we call reality that which exists now , what is reality after we have realised that there is n’t a well - defined “ now ” all over the universe ? The very grammar we use to talk about things , in which verbs have only a past , future and present tense , is inadequate to describe the ways of nature . In physics , a great debate on the nature of physical NN has developed in an arc spanning from Aristotle to Newton and from Newton to Einstein . Our understanding has repeatedly deepened in the course of this process . For Aristotle , NN is just a NN to count what happens , but it becomes an autonomous flowing variable for Newton and is then reinterpreted by Einstein as a feature of the gravitational field . Einstein ’s great NN , general relativity , keeps receiving spectacular empirical support — confirming such counter - intuitive predictions as black holes , expansion of the universe , NN dilation , gravitational waves and more . These give strong credibility to Einstein ’s picture and continue to rule out alternative conjectures . But there is certainly more to learn . We do not yet VB the fate of matter falling into the black holes we VBP in the sky , where Einstein ’s NN VBZ that NN comes to an end . And the full complexity of what we perceive as the flow of NN is not accounted for by general relativity alone : it involves quantum NN , thermodynamics and probably more , including neuroscience and the cognitive sciences . My own work in NN has been concentrated on the effort to understand how the quantum nature of the NN affects NN and NN . There is not yet agreement on a solution ; but there is a rather JJ consensus IN the expectation that the concept of physical NN is likely to move RB further away from our intuition , when its quantum properties are taken into account . This is why reflecting on the nature of NN is a constant concern for myself and JJ of my colleagues . Tentative NNS of quantum spacetime have little that resembles NN as we experience it . The basic equations of the NN on which I work , loop quantum gravity , have no special “ NN ” variable at all . They describe processes in which things VBP but no single NN variable can track all possible NNS . Does all this suggest our perception of NN is illusory ? It does not . But it indicates that what we perceive as NN MD not be a simple and elementary aspect of nature , but rather a complex phenomenon with JJ layers , each needing to be addressed by a JJ chapter of NN . This is the JJ question about the nature of NN : which aspects of our sense of it pertain to which domain of NN ? Key aspects of NN are described by the NN of heat , thermodynamics . Any NN the future is definitely distinguishable from the past , there is something IN heat involved . Thermodynamics traces the direction of NN to something called the “ low entropy of the past ” , a still mysterious phenomenon on which discussions rage . I have studied the hypothesis that some aspects of the solution might come from recognising a perspectival aspect for NN . VB of the magnificent spectacle of the daily rotation of the sky : we VBP the NN , NN and stars , the entire cosmos , majestically rotating . It has taken millennia for us to understand why . To figure this out , we had to consider ourselves . It is not the vast cosmos that is rotating , it is we who live on a spinning rock . This is a perspectival explanation . Something similarly perspectival , I VBP , underpins our peculiar perception of the flow of NN . Entropy growth orients NN and permits the existence of traces of the past , and these permit the possibility of memories , which hold together our sense of identity . I suspect that what we call the “ flowing ” of NN has to be understood by studying the structure of our brain rather than by studying physics : evolution has shaped our brain into a machine that feeds off memory in order to anticipate the future . This is what we are listening to when we listen to the passing of NN . Understanding the “ flowing ” of NN is therefore something that MD pertain to neuroscience more than to fundamental physics . Searching for the explanation of the feeling of flow in physics might be a mistake . Our understanding depends on the neural structures shaped by the peculiar environment in which we live . They capture a very imprecise version of the actual temporal structure of reality . Our experience is an approximation of an approximation of a description of the NN from our particular perspective as beings dependent on the growth of entropy , anchored to the thermodynamical arrow of NN . For us , there is , as Ecclesiastes has it , a NN to be born and a NN to die . The NN we experience is a multilayered , complex concept with distinct properties rooted in distinct layers of reality . JJ parts of the full story are still far from being clear . NN remains , to a JJ extent , a mystery , perhaps the greatest NN . A mystery that relates to issues ranging from the fate of black holes to the enigma of our individual identity and consciousness . Will we be able to understand things better in the future ? I VBP so . Our understanding of nature has increased vertiginously over the course of the centuries , and we are continuing to learn . We are glimpsing something about the mystery of NN . We can VB the NN described by quantum NNS of gravity : we can perceive with the NN ’s eye the profound structure of the NN where NN as we VBP it no longer exists — just as Paul McCartney ’s “ Fool on the Hill ” sees the NN spinning round when he sees the NN VBG down . I RB VBP we are beginning to VB that we are NN . We are this clearing opened by the traces of memory inside the connections between our neurons . We are memory . We are nostalgia . We are longing for a future that will not come . Horace , the greatest poet of Roman antiquity and perhaps the greatest cantor of NN , calls it our “ brief circle ” ( “ You must be wise . Pour the wine / and enclose in this brief circle / your JJ - cherished hope ” ) . This clearing , opened up for us by memory and anticipation , is our NN : a source of anguish on occasion , but in the end the marvellous gift of our existence .

DeVos ' believes her own remarks have "" not at all "" hurt her ability to transform the education NN , spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill VBD , providing a list of accomplishments so far . Those include rolling back education regulations proposed by the Obama administration , reforms to the student loan program , and a pro-school choice budget proposal for the federal NN . Here 's a look at her most controversial moments so far : DeVos landed back in the headlines this week after teachers and Connecticut 's Democratic governor rallied against her outside East Hartford High School , protesting her characterization of the school in a recent appearance before Congress . She quoted a JJ student named Michael , who she VBD was shunted from grade - to - grade with barely passing marks while being bullied . "" This constant fear made him hate school . He described the school he was assigned to as and I quote ' nothing more than adult daycare , a dangerous daycare , ' "" DeVos VBD . Teachers sent a "" message that they did n't VB Michael MD amount to much "" and there are "" countless other students IN him . "" Gov. Dannel Malloy VBD the student 's story "" undoubtedly had some validity for that individual "" but was an unfair characterization of the school and education NN . "" To have those words that were repeated about this institution this community without any fact checking without any background does n't speak well , "" VBD Malloy . Once in office , DeVos visited a middle school in NNP , and later described the teachers she met as being in "" receive mode "" and are "" waiting to be VBN what they have to do , "" rather than "" empowered to facilitate great teaching . "" The school , Jefferson Academy , blasted DeVos in return , saying she 's JJ only if "" you mean we ' receive ' students at a 2nd grade level and move them to an 8th grade level . "" Her confirmation hearing answer to a gun-related question was made all the more memorable because of how she answered it . DeVos has RB advocated for voucher systems that give NNS funds towards enrolling students at private schools . That position is already controversial , with critics saying a voucher NN MD undercut JJ schools . "" What if they VBD we are not accepting African - JJ students , but that was OK with the NN , "" Rep. Katherine Clark , D - Massachusetts pressed her . "" Do you VB any situation where you MD step in ? "" DeVos replied that the "" Office of Civil Rights and our Title IX ( anti- discrimination ) protections are broadly applicable across the board . "" "" I am shocked that you cannot come up with CD example of discrimination that you MD stand up for students , "" responded Clark . Colleges founded because of segregation were ' pioneers ' of school choice DeVos was accused of glossing over history after a meeting with officials from historically black colleges and universities . Critics pointed out that Jim Crow laws and racist policies barred African - Americans from enrolling , prompting the creation of HBCUs . DeVos appeared to respond by later saying HBCUs were "" born not out of mere choice , but out of necessity , in the face of racism , and in the aftermath of the Civil NNP . "" In a recent speech , DeVos took blasted critics of her school choice vision . "" They will be hurting the NNS and families who can least afford it . If politicians in a NN block education choice , it means those politicians do not support equal opportunity for all kids , "" she VBD ."

"" The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own . View more opinion articles on CNN . ( CNN ) This is the third in a series of three op - eds tracing the JJ path of Vice NNP Mike Pence 's ambition , from college , where he VBD a form of evangelicalism that weds theology to Republican politics , to the national stage -- and a job that puts him a short step away from the presidency . Part CD : Mike Pence 's plan to outlast NNP Part CD : Mike Pence went to college and VBD NNP Mike Pence won his JJ JJ campaign in 2000 VBG what became his basic strategy of guns , NNP , and NN . He raised lots of cash by appealing to JJ - NN conservative donors -- among them , Betsy DeVos , Charles and David Koch , and Erik Prince -- with hawkish positions on taxes and regulation . He VBD his voters at churches and gun clubs . He spiced his recipe with attacks on NN that placed him to the NN of JJ of his fellow Republicans . IN a handful of Republicans , Pence made an issue of the pending agreement to settle NN lawsuits against tobacco NNS for lying for decades about the dangers of their addictive NNS . Pence did n't just oppose the deal . He insisted it was VBN on a lie and the result of a pernicious NN plot . "" Despite the hysteria from the JJ class and the NN , "" Pence wrote in 2000 , "" smoking does n't kill . In fact , 2 out of every three smokers does not die from a smoking related illness and 9 out of ten smokers do not contract lung cancer . "" Pence 's JJ bit of NNS was simply wrong . CD - thirds of smokers actually do die of smoking - related illnesses . His second was misleading . Lung cancer is a relatively rare illness , but it is still vastly more common among smokers . In fact , it is CD of the few cancers for which NN has established a very well - VBN NN , and Pence 's column was published after industry leaders had acknowledged the NN risks of their product . Why MD a candidate for Congress speak so falsely and recklessly ? Pence 's motivation MD have been connected to his family 's ownership stake in a chain of convenience stores called Tobacco Road , which sold cigarettes alongside soft drinks and chips . But he was RB eager to establish some libertarian street cred . "" A NN JJ enough to VB after smokers is JJ enough to VB after you , "" he wrote . If Pence 's vocabulary was a bit 19th - century , so was his thinking . After calling Charles Darwin "" a sincere biologist , "" Pence attacked the NN of evolution , which , in his telling , was conjecture and thus no worthier of respect than other notions about the origins of NN . Darwin "" hoped that some day it MD be proven by the fossil record but did not live to VB that , "" declared Pence , "" nor have we . "" Of course , there is nothing uncertain in the prevailing NN on the origins of NN on NNP . As the National Academy of NNP explains , a scientific NN is not merely conjecture . It is "" a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of NN . "" This is why physicists still talk about a "" NN "" of gravity that explains why objects fall down and not up and biologists speak of "" cell NN , "" RB though the fact that living things are composed of cells is established truth . A willful denial of the facts was required for Pence to press his NN against Darwin , but he was clearly devoted to this NN . Having cast doubt on the NN of evolution , he VBD that he was only asking for everyone to be open - minded . "" I MD simply and humbly ask ... can we RB consider teaching other NNS of the origin of NNS ? "" Then , he declared that his own NN was shut . "" The Bible tells us that NNP created NN in his own imagine , male and female , "" VBD Pence . "" He created them . And I VBP that . "" Pence 's speech on evolution , preserved on C - SPAN , was delivered in the cadence of a radio preacher . Pence had developed this NN of speaking during his NNS as a broadcaster , when he pitched himself as "" Rush Limbaugh on decaf . "" But as friendly as he sounded , Pence was determined to impose his religious views through JJ policy and to do it through the manipulation of language . Another example was his proposal to use federal funds to turn gay NNS straight . So - called "" conversion therapy , "" promoted by quacks and religious bigots , assumes that homosexuality is a medically treatable pathology , which it is not . Pence 's proposal never gained traction in Congress , but it was a loud dog whistle to those on the homophobic Christian NN . With his sights set on the White NNP , Pence sought executive experience back home in Indiana , where a GOP advantage in registration helped him win a narrow victory in the 2012 governor 's race . He installed his wife , Karen , in an office at the NN NN , a JJ for JJ ladies of the NN , and had a pair of red phones wired to connect his desk directly with hers . Pence was unremarkable as governor , save for his commitment to the causes of Christian conservatives in pushing a NN law that permitted discrimination against gay customers by businesses . When Indiana 's Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 2015 was approved , Pence signed it into law in a rare , private ceremony where he was flanked by clergy from a variety of religions . Reaction to RFRA and the photo was intense . Pence backed down , seeking amendments that watered down the law . But while the episode seemed to threaten his future , he was rescued by Donald NNP 's offer to join his ticket as the GOP 's CD candidate for vice NN . Six months into the JJ administration , Republicans were already talking about how Pence seemed to be running a shadow campaign to become the GOP nominee for NN in the event that NNP was felled by either the NNP scandal or some other force . Pence 's chief of staff is a sharp - elbowed JJ player named Nick Ayers , and his connections to JJ donors are strong . Organized and methodical where the NNP is chaotic and impulsive , Pence is ready to achieve the dream he believes NNP wants him to fulfill . Should Pence achieve his goal , he MD likely remake the GOP , now almost a cult devoted to Donald NNP , as a Christian JJ JJ party where NNS of other faiths MD struggle to find a home . Instead of policy driven by personality , a Pence administration MD likely pursue policy guided by a particular reading of the Bible . And the divisions that now seem to be separating Americans MD become broader , deeper , and RB more difficult to bridge ."

The incident provoked responses from high profile NNS IN Neil deGrasse Tyson , who noted such statements made by a JJ figure are responsible for a strain of anti-intellectualism plaguing the nation . Unfortunately , few NNS seized the opportunity to explain why we VBP the NNP is in fact a globe . The following , therefore , highlights some of the foremost reasons why we VBP the NNP is round . The NN is not made of cheese and the NN is not JJ . This can be observed during a lunar eclipse , which occurs whenever the NNP ’s orbit places it in - between the NN and NN . The NNP casts a round shadow on the NN . Since the NNP is rotating and consistently casting a round shadow on the NN during every eclipse , its proves beyond a shadow ( forgive the pun ) of a doubt that the NNP is in fact round . Anyone who has ever waited for a ship to dock will notice that a ship does not sporadically appear off the horizon but gradually emerges from beneath the ocean . The reason ships do not emerge from the ocean – nor fall off the edge of NNP – is because the NN is round . The fact that ships appear to emerge from the depths of the NN is an illusion cast by NNP ’s curvature . If you place a stick upright , it will cast a shadow . The length of the shadow NNS throughout the day . If the NN was JJ , then CD sticks at JJ places should produce the same shadows . The problem is they do n’t , which only makes sense if the NNP is round . In fact , Eratosthenes took note of this phenomena to calculate the circumference of the NNP nearly 2,200 NNS ago . The curvature of the NNP If the NNP were JJ , then we all MD stand on an equal playing field . The problem , as anyone who has ever stood atop of a hill knows , is that the higher elevated you are , the more you can VB . At certain heights , you can actually VB the curvature of the NNP . This makes complete sense if the NNP is round and absolutely no sense if the NNP is JJ . JJ NN zones exist because the NN is an orbiting globe . When the NN shines on a spot of land , the other side is darkened ( and vise versa ) . This creates NN differences . If NNP was JJ , the NN MD shine on everyone at the same NN . JJ NNP NN is VBN upon an outdated understanding of gravity . Conventional understandings of gravity are incompatible with NNP NNP NN , because they require a spherical mass pulling all objects towards its center . JJ - Earthers propos that a disk - shaped NNP is accelerating “ upward , ” which gives the illusion of gravity . Of course , no explanation is given why or how the NNP is accelerating upwards . As the noted list has shown , not only are JJ - Earthers misinformed – they ’re square . Anyone who doubts the existence of gravity is invited to jump out of a three story building ."

But his budget boiler did n't have the NN needed to heat NN to 200 °C ( 400 °F ) and generate the steam required for the rocket to lift - off . A spokesman for Mr Hughes VBD that he plans to try another launch on Saturday , August 17 . ' I VBP the NNP is JJ , ' he VBD , but that ' this JJ NNP has nothing to do with the steam rocket launches . It never did . It never will . I 'm a daredevil !

Mr Hughes , who lives in Apple Valley , California , has seen a flurry of criticism over his plans in recent NNS . Detractors have labelled him a crackpot for planning launches in his homemade contraptions , as well as his belief that the NN is JJ .

CD of the men in charge on the Russian side was named V. M. ; he had a wife named T.M. V. was a level - headed scientist while his wife was rather deeply committed to the losing Communist NN - a NN she obviously was not abandoning . CD evening , during a trip early in 1992 , the JJ half of our venture were invited to V. & T.'s Moscow JJ as we were about to return to the NNPS . The party went well and we had the normal dinner discussions . As the evening wore on , T. developed a decidedly rough anti-American edge - CD her husband tried to quietly rein in . The bottom line of the tirade she started against the NNP NNPS went something IN this : "" You Americans always VBP to VB that you have the perfect NN and your NNS are always so perfect . Well then , why have n't you had a woman NN by now ? You had a chance to vote for a woman vice - NN and you did n't do it . "" The general response went something along the lines that you do n't vote for someone just because of their sex . Besides , you do n't vote for vice - NN , but the NN and vice - NN as a ticket . "" Well , I VBP you are VBG to be surprised when you VBP a black NN very soon . "" The consensus we expressed was that we did n't VB there was anything innately barring that . The JJ person at the JJ NN and sure , NNP MD try to vote for the JJ person , be he or she black or not . "" What if I VBD you that you will have a black NN very soon and he will be a Communist ? "" The out - of - the - blue remark was met by our stares . She continued , "" Well , you will ; and he will be a Communist . "" It was then that the husband unsuccessfully tried to VB the subject ; but she was on a roll and MD have nothing of it . CD of us asked , "" It sounds IN you VBP something we do n't VB . "" "" Yes , it is JJ . This is not some idle talk . He is already born and he is educated and being groomed to be NN RB now . You will be impressed to VB that he has gone to the best schools of Presidents . He is what you call "" Ivy NNP "" . You do n't VB me , but he is real and I RB VBP his name . His name is Barack . His mother is white and JJ and his father is black from Africa . That 's JJ , a chocolate baby ! And he 's VBG to be your NNP . "" She became more and more smug as she presented her stream of detailed NN and predictions so matter - of - factly - as though all were foregone conclusions . "" It 's all been thought out . His father is not an JJ black so he wo n't have that JJ slave stigma . He is intelligent and he is half white and has been raised from the cradle to be an atheist and a Communist . He 's gone to the finest schools . He is being guided every step of the NN and he will be irresistible to NNP . "" We sat there not knowing what to VB . She was obviously very happy that the Communists were doing this and that it MD somehow be a thumbing of their collective noses at NNP : they MD give us a black NN and he'd be a Communist to boot . She made it quite obvious that she thought that this was VBG to breathe JJ NN into NN Communism . From this and other conversations with her , she always asserted that Communism was far from dead . She was full of little details about him that she was eager to relate . I thought that maybe she was trying to show off that this truly was a real person and not just hot air . She rattled off a complete litany . He was from Hawaii . He went to school in California . He lived in Chicago . He was soon to be elected to the legislature . "" Have no doubt : he is CD of us , a Soviet . "" At CD point , she related some sort of San Francisco connection , but I did n't understand what the point was and do n't recall much about that . I was just left with the notion that she considered the city to be some sort of a center for their activity here . Since I had dabbled in languages , I knew a smattering of Arabic . I made a comment : "" If I remember correctly , ' Barack ' comes from the Arabic word for ' Blessing . ' That seems to be an odd name for an NNP . "" She replied quickly , "" Yes . It is ' African ' "" , she insisted , "" and he will be a blessing for NN Communism . We will regain our strength and become the number CD NN in the NN . "" She continued with something to the effect that NNP was at the same NN the great hope and the great obstacle for Communism . NNP MD have to be converted to Communism and Barack was VBG to pave the NN . So , what does this conversation from 1992 prove ? Well , it 's definitely anecdotal . It does n't prove that Obama has had Soviet Communist training nor that he was groomed to be the JJ black JJ NN , but it does show CD thing that I VBP is very important . It shows that Soviet Russian Communists knew of Barack from a very early date . It RB shows that they truly believed among themselves that he was raised and groomed Communist to pave the NN for their future . This report on Barack came personally to me from CD of them RB before NNP knew he existed . Although I had never before heard of him , at the NN of this conversation Obama was 30 + NNS old and was obviously tested enough that he was their anticipated rising star ."

It did n’t take RB from the birth of the NN wide web for the NN to start VBG this JJ medium to transmit , collect and analyze NN in ways never before imagined . The JJ message boards and clunky “ Web 1.0 ” websites soon gave NN to “ the blogosphere . ” The arrival of JJ NN was the next step in this evolution , allowing for the formation of communities of interest to share NN in real NN about events happening anywhere on the globe . But as quickly as communities began to form IN these JJ platforms , governments and militaries were RB quicker in recognizing the potential to use this JJ medium to more effectively spread their own propaganda . Their goal ? To shape JJ discourse IN JJ events in a NN favourable to their standing JJ and geopolitical objectives . Their method ? The Weaponization of NNP NNP . This is The Corbett Report . NNP . NNP . NNP . Snapchat . Instagram . Reddit . “ JJ NN ” as we VBP it today barely existed fifteen NNS ago . Although it provides JJ ways to interact with NNS and NN from all across the NN virtually instantaneously and virtually for free , we are only now beginning to understand the depths of the problems associated with these JJ platforms . More and more of the original developers of JJ NN sites IN NNP and NNP admit they no longer use JJ NN themselves and actively keep it away from their NNS , and now they are finally admitting the reason why : JJ NN was designed specifically to take advantage of your psychological weaknesses and keep you addicted to your screen . SEAN PARKER : If the thought process that went into building these applications — NNP being the JJ of them to RB understand it — that thought process was all about “ How do we consume as much of your NN and conscious attention as possible ? ” And that means that we VBP to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever , and that ’s gonna VB you to contribute more NN and that ’s gonna VB you more likes and comments . So it ’s a JJ validation feedback loop . I mean it ’s exactly the kind of thing that a hacker IN myself MD come up with , because you ’re exploiting a vulnerability in JJ psychology . And I VBP that we — the inventors / creators , you VBP , it ’s me , it ’s Mark , it ’s Kevin Systrom at Instagram , it ’s all of these NNS — understood this consciously and we did it anyway . It should be no surprise , then , that in this NN of JJ NN addicts and smartphone zombies , the 24/7 newsfeed is taking up a greater and greater share of NNS ’s lives . Our thoughts , our opinions , our NN of the NN , RB our mood are increasingly being influenced or RB determined by what we VBP being posted , tweeted or vlogged . And the process by which these NNS shape our opinions is being carefully monitored and analyzed , not by the JJ NN NNS themselves , but by the US NN . MARINA PORTNAYA : When the NN ’s largest JJ NN platform betrays its NNS , there ’s VBG to be outrage . ABC HOST : The NN to VB whether NNP MD influence the emotional NN of its NNS on that NN feed . CNN ANCHOR : It allowed researchers to manipulate almost 700,000 NNS ’ NN feeds . Some saw more positive NN about their friends , others saw more negative . CNN GUEST : Well I ’m not surprised . I mean we ’re all kind of lab rat than the JJ NNP experiment . PORTNAYA : But it was n’t only NNP ’s experiment . It turns out the psychological NN was connected to the US NN ’s research on JJ unrest . MORNING JOE GUEST : This is RB kind of creepy . PORTNAYA : And it gets worse . What you MD not VB is that the US Department of Defense has reportedly spent roughly $ 20 CD conducting studies aimed at learning how to manipulate JJ behavior in order to influence opinion . The initiative was launched in 2011 by the Pentagon ’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , otherwise VBN as DARPA . The program is best described as the US NN ’s effort to become better at detecting and conducting propaganda campaigns via JJ NN . Translation : When anti-government messages gain ground virally , NNP wants to find a NN to spread counter opinion . The DARPA document that details the Pentagon ’s plans for influencing opinions in the JJ NN NN is called “ NNP NNP in Strategic Communication . ” DARPA ’s goal , according to their own website , is “ to develop tools to VB identify misinformation or deception campaigns and counter them with truthful NN . ” Exactly what tools were developed for this purpose and how they are currently being deployed is unclear . But Rand Walzman , the program ’s creator , admitted last NN that the project lasted four NNS , cost $ 50 CD and led to the publication of over 200 papers . The papers , including “ Incorporating JJ Cognitive Biases in a Probabilistic Model of Retweeting , ” “ Structural Properties of Ego Networks , ” and “ Sentiment Prediction VBG Collaborative Filtering , ” make the thrust of the program perfectly clear . JJ NN NNS are lab rats being carefully scrutinized by NN - supported researchers , their tweets and NNP posts and Instagram pictures being analyzed to determine how NN spreads RB , and , by implication , how the NN and the NN can use these JJ NN networks to make their own propaganda “ VB viral . ” As worrying as this research is , it pales in comparison to the NN that governments , militaries and JJ lobby groups are already employing squadrons of NN soldiers to wage NN warfare in the JJ NN battlespace . CTV ANCHOR : So is it okay to have the NN monitor JJ NN conversations and then to wade in and correct some of those conversations ? With more on this , let ’s VB to technology expert Carmi Levy . He ’s on the line from Montreal . Carmi , do you VB the NN ’s monitoring what you and I are saying RB now ? Is this whole thing getting out of line , or what ? CARMI LEVY : It opens up a bit of a question . I ’d VB to call it a Pandora ’s box about , you VBP , what exactly is the NN ’s aim here , and what do they hope to accomplish with what they find out ? And as they accumulate this NN RB — this NNS on us — where does that NNS VB ? And so I VBP as much as we should applaud the NN for getting into this area , the optics of it are potentially very NNP Brother -ish . And the NN RB does VB to be a little bit more concrete on what its intentions are and how it intends to achieve them . 4WWL REPORTER : JJ NN that NN - owned computers at the Army Corps of Engineers office here in NNP Orleans are being VBN to verbally attack critics of the Corps comes in an affidavit from the JJ editor - in - chief of nola.com . Jon Donley , who was laid off this past February , tells us via satellite from Texas , in late 2006 he started noticing NNS presenting themselves as ordinary citizens defending the Corps very energetically . JON DONLEY : What stuck out , though , was the wording of the comments was in JJ ways mirroring NN releases from the Corps of Engineers . SANDY ROSENTHAL : These commenters tried to discredit these NNS . . . 4WWL REPORTER : And when Rosenthal investigated , she discovered the comments were coming from NNS at the internet provider address of the Army Corps of Engineers offices here in NNP Orleans . She blamed the Corps for a strategy of VBG after critics . ROSENTHAL : In the process of trying to obscure the facts of the NNP Orleans floodings , CD of their tactics was just verbal abuse . These operations are only the visible and publicly - admitted front of a vast array of JJ and intelligence programs that are attempting to influence JJ behaviour , spread NN propaganda , and disrupt JJ communities that arise in opposition to their agenda . That such programs exist is not a matter of conjecture ; it is mundane , established , documented fact . In 2014 , an internal document was leaked from GCHQ , the British equivalent of the NSA . The document , never intended for JJ release , was entitled “ The Art of Deception : Training for a NNP Generation of NNP Covert Operations ” and bluntly stated that “ We VBP to build Cyber Magicians . ” It then goes on to outline the “ magic ” techniques that must be employed in influence and NN operations RB , including deception and manipulation techniques IN “ anchoring , ” “ priming ” and “ branding ” propaganda narratives . After presenting a map of JJ networking technologies that are targeted by these operations , the document then instructs the “ magicians ” how to deceive the NN through “ attention management ” and behavioural manipulation . That governments MD turn to these strategies is hardly a shocking development . In fact , the use of NN shills to propagate NN talking points and disrupt JJ dissent has been openly advocated on the record by high - ranking NN officials for the past decade . In 2008 , Cass Sunstein , a law professor who MD VB on to become Obama ’s NN “ czar , ” co-authored a paper entitled “ NN NNS , ” in which he wrote that the “ best response ” to JJ “ NN NNS ” is what he calls “ cognitive infiltration ” of groups spreading these ideas . It is perhaps particularly ironic that the idea that NN agents are actually and admittedly spreading propaganda RB under JJ identities is , to the less - informed members of the population , itself a “ NN NN ” rather than an established NN fact . Unsurprisingly , when confronted about his proposal , Sunstein pretended to not remember having written it and then pointedly refused to answer any questions about it . Now , a decade on from Sunstein ’s proposal , we VBP that JJ psyops agents , JJ lobbyists , corporate shills and NN propagandists are spending vast sums of NN and employing entire armies of keyboard warriors , leaving comments and shaping conversations to VB the NN ’s opinions , influence their behaviour , and RB alter their mood . And they are helped along in this quest by the very same technology that allows the NN to connect on a scale never before possible . Technology is always a double - edged sword , and sometimes it can be dangerous to wield that sword at all . There are ways to identify and neutralize the threat of JJ trolls and shills , but the phenomenon is not likely to VB away any NN soon . Each of us must find our own answer to the question of how best to incorporate these technologies into our NN . But the next NN you find yourself caught up in an argument with an JJ persona that MD or MD not be a genuine JJ being , it might be better to ask yourself if your efforts are better spent engaging in the argument or just turning off the computer ."

Image_NN :_: NASA_NNP ._.","From NN shells and spiral galaxies to the structure of JJ lungs , the patterns of chaos are all IN us . Fractals are patterns formed from chaotic equations and contain self - similar patterns of complexity increasing with magnification . If you divide a fractal pattern into parts you VBP a nearly identical reduced - size copy of the whole . The mathematical beauty of fractals is that infinite complexity is formed with relatively simple equations . By iterating or repeating fractal - generating equations JJ times , random outputs create beautiful patterns that are unique , yet recognizable . We have pulled together some of the most stunning natural examples we MD find of fractals on our NN . Above : This variant form of cauliflower is the ultimate fractal vegetable . Its pattern is a natural representation of the Fibonacci or golden spiral , a logarithmic spiral where every quarter turn is farther from the origin by a factor of phi , the golden ratio . Image : Flickr / Tin.G. The San Francisco Bay salt flats pictured above have been VBN for commercial salt production for over a century . Below , an image from the largest salt NN in the NN , Salar de Uyuni , located in southern Bolivia . The encrusted salt shows a remarkably consistent but random pattern , a characteristic of fractals . Images : 1 ) Flickr / Tolka Rover . 2 ) Flickr / Mike D. Green . Extinct for 65 CD NNS , ammonites were marine cephalopods that built chambered spiral shells . The walls between these chambers , called sutures , were complex fractal curves . Stephen Jay Gould VBD the complexity of ammonite sutures over NN to argue that there is no evolutionary drive toward greater complexity and that we are a "" glorious accident , "" alone in the universe . The shells of ammonites RB grow as a logarithmic spiral , a pattern that appears often in nature , as with romanesco broccoli . Ammonites RB inspired this cathedral staircase in Barcelona , Spain . Images : 1 ) Flickr / cobalt123 . 2 ) Flickr / Didier.bier . 3 ) Flickr / Edgley Cesar Mountains are the result of tectonic forces pushing the crust upward and erosion tearing some of that crust down . The resulting pattern is a fractal . Above is an image of the Himalayan Mountains , home to JJ of the tallest peaks on NNP . The Himalayas are still being uplifted by the collision of India with the Eurasian plate , which began about 70 CD NNS ago . Image : NNP / GSFC / JPL , MISR Team . Ferns are a common example of a self - similar set , meaning that their pattern can be mathematically generated and reproduced at any magnification or reduction . The mathematical formula that describes ferns , named after Michael Barnsley , was CD of the JJ to show that chaos is inherently unpredictable yet generally follows deterministic rules VBN on nonlinear iterative equations . In other words , random numbers generated over and over VBG Barnsley 's Fern formula ultimately produce a unique fern - shaped object . Images : 1 ) Flickr / cobalt123 . 2 ) Flickr / CatDancing . The marine stratus clouds above were photographed by the Aqua satellite over the South Atlantic Ocean , off the west coast of Africa . A fractal cloud pattern is interrupted by a series of diagonal grooves . According the NNP NNP Observatory , it is highly unusual to VB such a sharp boundary in a continual cloud formation such as this , and NNS have yet to explain how it MD form . Below , the 200 - mile JJ series of cloud vortexes is perhaps the longest of these formations ever photographed , according to NNP . These cloud vortexes are RB called von Kármán cloud streets , for the late fluid dynamicist Theodore von Kármán . Cloud streets form when low - lying clouds are interrupted by an object such as an island . Similar patterns occur in the wind flow downstream of airplane wings . Images : 1 ) Jeff Schmaltz / MODIS Land Rapid Response Team / NNP . 2 ) NNP . JJ plants follow simple recursive formulas in generating their branching shapes and leaf patterns . Ironically , deforestation patterns that occur along primary , secondary and tertiary roadways form a similar pattern , IN that pictured below from the NN of Rondonia in western Brazil , CD of the most deforested regions of the Amazon . Images : 1 ) Flickr / CatDancing . 2 ) NNP . This JJ - color image above , of the Grand Canyon , displays the fractal pattern created by the Colorado River over millions of NNS . Red indicates areas of vegetation in the image . Below , a JJ - color image of Canyon de Chelly National Monument in Arizona . The National Park Service calls it CD of the longest continually inhabited landscapes in North NNP . Images : 1 ) GeoEye / NN Imaging . 2 ) NNP . The path lightning takes is formed step by step as it moves towards the ground , turning air into plasma . Images : 1 ) Flickr / thefost . 2 ) Flickr / Brujo +. Peacocks attract mates with the repeating patterns in their plumage . Images : 1 ) Flickr / Digimist . 2 ) Flickr / Maia C . Crystallizing NN forms repeating patterns in snowflakes and on frosty surfaces . The patterns have inspired claims about the NN of consciousness to affect matter , as well as CD of the JJ described fractal curves , the Koch snowflake . Images : 1 ) Flickr / mommamia . 2 ) Flickr / monteregina . Similar to canyons , a combination of rock irregularity and gravity produces repeating patterns as NN flows over the side of a sharp ledge .

Seen as the “ JJ age of exploration ” , the 21st century promises to solve some of the most intriguing puzzles of our current history . NNS are still discussing the purpose of the Nazca lines . Do these complex geoglyphs in Peru symbolize constellations ? Are they compared to giant alien landing spots , or are these signs showing the NN for their ships ? For now , no NN seems plausible enough when it comes to explaining their purpose . These are the famous Nazca lines , a mystery that has concerned countless researchers for over 80 NNS . These mysterious markings were built on the ground , but can only be seen from above . It ’s worth mentioning that the area is mostly JJ and cannot offer a higher view of the glyphs . The Nazca Lines can be VBN in the Nazca Desert , a barren plateau that expands between the city of Nasca and Palpa on the pampa , which is a smooth , desolated area of southern Peru . They cover - up an era of desert of nearly 400 square NNS . Overall , there are more than 800 successive lines , 300 geometric figures and 70 animal and plant designs . Some of the straight lines stretch over 30 NNS , while the other designs range from 50 to 1,200 NNS in length , being as JJ as the Empire NNP Building . Enormous geoglyphs are VBN in other places on NNP , such as Egypt , Chile , Bolivia , the NNP NNPS ( Mississippi and California ) , Malta and in other NNS . However , the Nazca geoglyphs form an impressive and mysterious archaeological group because of their number , range , typical features as well as cultural continuity and preservation over the centuries . The Nazca plain is remarkable for its ability to maintain the markings intact over a JJ period of NN . Because the NN is CD of the driest on NNP , recording only twenty minutes of rainfall each NN , and the rocky soil which reduces the effect of wind at ground level , this barren place is ideal for preserving a work of art for eternity . The clarity and positioning of the lines and drawings leave no doubt that an exhaustive and JJ - term effort was instrumental in their creation . There are diverse designs consisting of shapes of animals , plants , objects , flowers , and RB huge manlike figures made with well - defined lines . The most renowned drawing is of a weird being looking similar to an astronaut . Measuring close to 100 NNS in length , it was discovered by Maria Reiche in the 1960’s . Another curious representation is of a strange being with CD huge , monstrous hands , CD of them possessing only four fingers . South of the Nazca Lines , on the pampa , archaeologists have discovered the ancient city of the line - builders – Cahuachi . It was constructed almost CD thousand NNS ago and was inexplicably deserted 500 NNS later . Recent findings at Cahuachi are starting to slowly blow the dust off this ancient mystery . Italian researcher Giuseppe Orefici has been uncovering the site ’s secrets for the past decades , bringing a team down each NN . He concluded that the settlement ’s population was quite JJ , but the city was RB a pilgrimage center that brought a huge increase in population whenever ceremonial events occurred . These events seemingly concerned the Nazca Lines and the colossal sand dune of Nasca . This NN seems very plausible because of the archaeological NN provided by the Nazca lines , showing creatures such as a killer whales and monkeys , which did not exist in the Nazca region . Because of the arid NN the recent findings consist of clothing and amazingly preserved mummified bodies of the Nazca NNS . Archaeologist Fredrik Hiebert considers that our current progress in technology will VB in solving this ancient mystery :"

"" The surprise was what happened to Xena ( Lucy Lawless ) and her sidekick , Gabrielle ( played by Reneé O'Connor ) . They were crucified by the Romans . NNS dying and coming back are fairly common in the "" Xena "" universe , but coming back from a season - ending crucifixion called for something more than just a shower scene in the fall . So this week 's fifth - season premiere , "" Fallen Angel , "" sets something of a record for hour - JJ television shows , thanks to 270 special - effect shots in which Xena carries on the good fight in the afterlife . "" Xena "" is written and shot in NNP Zealand , but the special effects are made at NNP NNP Productions Inc. in Burbank , California . When the NNP NNP crew saw the "" Fallen Angel "" script , VBZ 3 - D effects supervisor Mark Tamny , there was "" shock at RB . And then you start to come up with a plan to figure out how you 're actually VBG to achieve all the shots -- how it 's all VBG to come together . "" The special - effects crew gets involved in every part of a production of this kind , from piecing together real elements to embellishing the truth with realistic - looking fakes . In CD shot , they might start off with Lawless as an archdemon , shot against a blue screen . That 's part of the "" chroma key "" process that allows the development of composite images VBN in television in JJ NN forecasts and in film for special effects . And what effects -- behind Lawless goes a painted background : some digital rocky pillars , a squadron of flying digital demons , and after a few hundred hours of work , magic . To make the magic happen , the actor is shot in front of a blue screen ( 1 ) , then a background is created ( 2 ) , and flying demons are animated ( 3 ) . Then all are composited together for a final shot ( 4 ) . Some of the shots , IN evil Callisto ( Hudson Leick ) drop - kicking a hapless angel , were delivered on film . But the special effects crew had to erase the wires that held him up , speed up the angel 's motion and RB add some digital - camera motion . "" We did n't VB it to look IN if this was a real environment that they actually just planted a camera on CD of these pillars , "" VBZ composing artist Todd Vaziri . "" We wanted to give you the impression that maybe it was from a helicopter , or some kind of a gliding mechanism or something . "" Some of the flying sequences MD n't be done with real actors on wires , so digital stand - ins were created on the drafting board . "" What we deliver is JJ elements , "" VBZ Mark Kochinski , another 3 - D effects supervisor , as he shows off his work . "" UH , this is Xena flying , and then this is the beam of light she 's flying through . And then when the shot is composited , you can VB her flying through the clouds , which are a separate element . "" Some effects executed on film in NNP Zealand needed some high - tech touch ups in California , among them archangel Gabrielle 's wings , which did n't work on film . "" We went into the shot , "" VBZ Kochinski , "" removed the wings that she was wearing , created some three - dimensional wings that were a bit more animated and then married them to her body for that shot . "" "" Xena , Warrior Princess "" carries the battle RB beyond real NN almost every week .

Acting on a hunch , Léon Foucault had determined that he MD use a pendulum to illustrate the effect of the NNP ’s movement . He called together a group of NNS , enticing them with a note declaring , “ You are invited to VB the NNP turn . ” Foucault hung a pendulum from the ceiling of the Meridian Room of the Paris Observatory . As it swept through the air , it traced a pattern that effectively proved the NN was spinning about an axis . A month later , Foucault shared his experiment with all of Paris at the majestic Pantheon building . According to the NNP Physical Society , he suspended from the Pantheon ’s lofty dome a 61 - pound brass bob on a 220 - NN cable . As it swung back and forth , the pointed end of the bob traced lines in sand that had been poured on a wooden platform . Over NN , the angle of these lines changed , suggesting to audience members that the direction of the pendulum ’s travel was shifting under the influence of an unperceived rotational motion — that of NNP . Foucault was able to demonstrate a scientific concept in a NN that the average person MD easily grasp , VBZ Rebecca C. Thompson , head of JJ outreach for the APS . For centuries , it was a commonly held belief that the NNP rotated on an axis . But it was Foucault who dispelled lingering doubts once and for all , establishing the phenomenon firmly in the realm of fact . “ It RB started the cultural shift to fundamentally understanding our universe differently , ” Thompson VBZ . The experiment was a hit , drawing flocks of fascinated Parisians and catapulting Foucault to fame . Pendulums VBN on Foucault ’s calculations began appearing worldwide — and are still iconic features of JJ NN museums in the U.S. and other NNS . The Smithsonian Institution made a pendulum a focal point of its Museum of History and Technology ( which later became the National Museum of NNP History ) . The building — which opened in 1964 on the National Mall in NNP , D.C. — was designed purposely to accommodate a pendulum . It hung from the ceiling of the third floor and stretched 71 NNS through the center of the building , where it swung slowly and rhythmically across a fancifully emblazoned circle on the JJ floor . The Smithsonian pendulum was intended to be viewed from above , on the second floor . Looking down , visitors MD VB a symmetrical hollow brass bob weighing about 240 pounds and shaped IN an inverted teardrop . As it moved back and forth — facilitated by an electromagnetic push to keep it continuously swinging despite air resistance and vibrations in the cable — it MD knock down inch - or - so - high pins standing at fixed points along the circumference of a JJ circle . Over NN , viewers MD VB the direction of the pendulum ’s swing NN , implying that the NNP was rotating beneath them . The Smithsonian pendulum , IN all pendulums , moved in accordance with Foucault ’s sine law , which predicts how much a pendulum ’s path will distort each day VBN on its latitude . Absent any exterior forces , a pendulum MD swing back and forth in a single plane forever — there MD be no gradual angular shift . But the NNP is rotating , so the story is n’t that simple . Since all points on NNP ’s NN rotate as a unit , it follows that those located on the wider portions of the NN — nearer to the equator — must cover more meters each second ( i.e. , VB faster ) to “ keep up ” with the points tracing smaller circles each day at the extreme northern and southern latitudes . Though they do n’t feel it , a person standing in Quito , Ecuador , is moving with appreciably higher velocity than CD in Reykjavik , Iceland . Because each swing of a pendulum takes it from a point farther from the equator to a point nearer to the equator and vice versa , and the velocities at these points differ , the path of the pendulum is subtly distorted with every swing , gradually torqued away from its original orientation . The extent of this effect depends on where on NNP the pendulum is swinging . At the North Pole — where JJ NNS in latitude have JJ implications — the path traced by a pendulum MD shift through a full 360 degrees in a mere 24 hours , explains Thompson . At the equator , meanwhile , a pendulum ’s motion MD not be seen to distort at all . VBG his sine law , Foucault predicted that the path of his pendulum in Paris MD shift 11.25 degrees each hour , or 270 degrees in a day . And it did . His sine law allows anyone with a decent grounding in trigonometry to use a pendulum to determine their latitude . But mostly , at museums IN the NN , the pendulum has become an object that elicits wonder . As iconic as the elephant that greets visitors in the rotunda of the Smithsonian ’s National Museum of Natural History , the pendulum at the History and Technology museum was a meeting place , a striking backdrop for reflection and education . “ It was very much IN a fountain in a park , ” VBZ Peter Liebhold , a curator in the division of work and industry at the NNP History Museum . NNS and adults alike MD stare at the pendulum , meditating on its motion and meaning . CD morning in 1998 , before the museum had opened , the cable snapped , sending the massive bob hurtling towards the floor , narrowly missing a staffer . Rather than repair the cable , the museum elected to retire Foucault ’s pendulum . Its director at the NN decided the device did not have much to do with either NNP or history , VBZ Liebhold . The decision divided staffers . “ There were pendulum huggers and pendulum haters , ” Liebhold VBZ . Pro-pendulum employees VBD it was cool and fun to watch . The anti-pendulum group believed it did n’t add much to the museum ’s efforts to teach the NN about JJ history and culture . Though Liebhold VBZ he was in the haters ’ camp , he believes pendulums have their place , just elsewhere . A pendulum “ makes the masses more trusting of the NN of NN , ” he VBZ . Thompson agrees , and notes that while the pendulum is no longer needed to prove that the NNP rotates , “ it is useful if we can VB kids engaged in NN . ”"

Upon waking nearly four hours later , unbeknownst to Beltran , he believes a Radio - Frequency IDentification ( RFID ) chip had been implanted in the rear area of his mouth where the lower and upper jaws connect . During a November 29 interview , Beltran VBD this writer , “ A recent girlfriend of mine that was associated with law enforcement took me to a dentist that I ’d never before visited . Without my consent , the dentist VBD a very unusual looking syringe and knocked me out for between three and four hours . Since I ’d been in the JJ field for over 20 NNS , I ’m familiar with syringes , and this JJ - gauge needle looked IN the old - style equipment that JJ doctors VBD . ” The horrors got worse during this procedure . Beltran continued his account : “ When I regained consciousness three to four hours later , my entire chest was drenched in saliva . Supposedly , I had received CD root canals and had CD teeth capped . But after visiting a JJ dentist earlier this NN , his X - rays revealed that only CD root canal had been performed , and no crowns put in place . ” In an extensive portfolio presented to this newspaper , Beltran provided a series of X - rays and MRI scans that show what appear to be CD foreign bodies in the back portion of his mouth . Beltran claims CD JJ doctors have confirmed these results . When asked if he has experienced any physical afflictions as a result , Beltran replied , “ A JJ Marine VBD me that similar RFID chips are VBN by the U.S. NN on prisoners in Afghanistan to send and receive NN . The device in my mouth is approximately the size of a grain of rice , and depending on the frequencies being transmitted , I undergo nausea , vertigo , hearing loss and swollen glands . Plus , because [ I have a ] technical background , I can hear a ‘ 60 - cycle whine . ’ ” To clarify this phenomenon , Beltran explained , “ This 60 - cycle whine is an electrical sound emitted from the device , but with a higher pitch that I hear originating from IN my JJ ear , but not exactly . ” When Beltran visited a local district attorney with his X - rays , he was VBN , “ This was done because of something you VBP that somebody wants , or they do n’t VB you to VB something . ” The district attorney then VBD Beltran about S.B. 362 , introduced by NN senator Joe Simitian ( D - Palo Alto ) , which VBZ that “ subdermal implantation of RFID chips in the NN of California against a person ’s consent ” is illegal . Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed this legislation in 2007 . “ Why MD there VB to be such a law in the JJ place unless these procedures were already being performed ? ” asked Beltran . The obvious question at this point is : Why MD someone VB to implant an RFID device in Beltran ’s mouth ? This is where the story gets eerie . Beltran provided the answer . “ In 1991 I was the supervisor for a private ambulance NN in Sacramento when we were dispatched to the scene of a high - speed pursuit involving the potential kidnapping of a four - or five - NN - old girl , ” he VBD . “ The suspect was apprehended and dragged from his car by law enforcement officers and then beaten to death . However , it turned out that the suspect was actually the little girl ’s father , and it was n’t a kidnapping , but a custody issue . So , this NN ’s father was beaten to death with billy clubs before her very eyes . ” He added : “ After I tried to write a report about what I ’d witnessed , my supervisor VBD me to keep my mouth shut or I ’d be blacklisted . That ’s when the cover - up began . ” Still , why MD this incident affect Beltran nearly CD decades later to the extent that an invasive JJ procedure was perhaps conducted without his NN and against his will ? “ The motive leads back to me witnessing a murder that now affects the candidates ( in a local 2010 sheriff ’s NN ) who were in charge of the cover - up , ” he VBD . “ Last NN , I emailed CD of the candidates and asked : If a law enforcement officer is informed of a murder , are they required to report it ? Twenty minutes later I received a phone call from CD of the officers associated with the cover - up of this murder . If this NN is divulged , it will completely ruin the sheriff ’s NN [ in November 2010 ] . A colleague has RB VBN me that the sheriff ’s department and local FBI are behind what has happened to me . ” Although California politicians such as Senator Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif . ) and Representative Dan Lungren ( D - Calif . ) have offered no NN , nor has local NN , Beltran VBZ TruTV and Jesse Ventura have shown an interest in filming the surgery when the RFID device is removed from his mouth . Beltran has RB met with an area district attorney , who has yet to decide whether the crimes committed against him fall under local jurisdiction or that of the USA PATRIOT Act and domestic terrorism . Victor Thorn is a hard - hitting researcher , journalist and author of over 50 books ."

As we had previously reported on in our August 3rd report titled “ NNP Burns , NNP Drowns : US To Blame ? ” Russian research scientist Dr. Andrey Areshev has joined the ranks of International NNS and experts stating their belief that the extreme NN chaos currently battering our NNP is being caused by the Tesla technology VBN weapons systems directed from ’s High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program , otherwise VBN as HAARP . Now according to this GRU report , Senator Stevens was approached less than a fortnight ago by his longtime friend and Alaskan bush pilot Theron “ Terry ” Smith whose son- in - law , Alaskan Air National Guard Major Aaron W. Malone , was killed on July 28th after having his C - 17 US JJ aircraft “ targeted ” by a HAARP “ Tesla Beam ” while in the air over Anchorage , Alaska causing it to crash and explode upon impact killing all aboard . [ Note : The Russian translation for “ targeted ” as VBN in this report does not assign HARRP blame as it includes an “ accidental ” verb component . ] Upon Senator Stevens beginning his investigation into HAARP ’s causing the crash of the Major Malone ’s C - 17 , this report continues , he enlisted the aid of CD powerful NN brokers , oil fortune heir William “ NNP ” Phillips Sr. and JJ NNP administrator Sean O'Keefe . Phillips was a longtime ally and supporter of Senator Stevens and as the heir to the Phillips Petroleum fortune is VBN in these reports to have in the past VBN his vast fortune to privately finance US intelligence “ activities ” to support his NNS efforts to gain access to JJ oil reserves . Phillips had RB warned Americans that the does not have any JJ oil NNS . And it ’s JJ : the largest JJ oil NN , Exxon Mobil , is only the 14th largest in the NNP and is dwarfed by the RB JJ oil NNS -- all owned by foreign governments or NN - sponsored monopolies -- that dominate the NNP 's oil supply . With 94 % of the NNP 's oil supply locked up by foreign governments , most of which are hostile to the , the relatively puny JJ oil NNS do not have access to enough crude oil to significantly affect the NN and VB bring prices down . Thus , ExxonMobil , a “ JJ ” oil NN , buys 90 % of the crude oil that it refines for the NN from the JJ players , i.e. , mostly - hostile foreign governments . O’Keefe was the JJ administrator for the Untied NNPS NN agency NNP from 2001 - 2005 , and whose reign included the NNP Shuttle Columbia disaster that occurred on February 1 , 2003 , when upon its reentry into NNP ’s atmosphere disintegrated over Texas , and which this report VBZ O’Keefe “ always ” blamed on HAARP because at the exact NN of this tragedy it had begun transmitting in what is called “ deep NN communication mode ” . [ Note : During the "" Navy Deep - NNP Communication "" operational mode , the shortwave radio pulses are all , with JJ precision , exactly 6.25 seconds RB with either exactly 15 or 30 second spaces between pulses . Those JJ and short binary spaces in between the pulses are actually the coded message . Something IN the dits and dahs of very slow Morse code . In this mode , the NN is usually at maximum . Unlike the research mode , which mostly runs at night , the US Navy communication mode can be at any NN of the day or night , any month of the NN . The transmissions MD run continuously for about CD to 30 hours , or from CD to several days . Following the 9 - 11 NNP Trade Center attack , and just minutes after the NNP declared the highest Defense Condition Four ( DefCon4 ) , HAARP began transmitting at highest NN for 18 hours in "" deep- NN communication "" mode . This is the only NN to communicate the DefCon4 condition and updated battle commands to the US nuclear submarines on station NNS deep in the ocean . ] The various transmission ranges of HAARP are important to note , this report VBZ , as “ immediately prior ” to Senator Stevens plane VBG down Russian satellites orbiting over the Arctic detected a “ powerful ” 3.39 megahertz signal emanating from HAARP ’s Copper Valley Area , Gakona , Alaska base and “ directed ” over the region this tragedy occurred in . According to US NN reports Phillips was killed in this crash [ photo 2nd left ] and O’Keefe is in hospital in critical condition , and with Senator Stevens being killed RB means their investigation into HAARP has died along with them . To the chaos erupting all over the NNP as the result of Obama ’s allowing the use of these catastrophic HAARP “ NN weapons ” it can only be described as being “ biblical ” in the apocalyptic destruction it is causing , and which includes : Ø The greatest heatwave and destructive fires has experienced in over 1,000 NNS . Ø The greatest flooding has experienced in over 800 NNS . Ø Flooding in so epic the NNP Nations has named this megadisaster as being worse than the 2004 tsunami that shattered the basin . Ø Flooding so catastrophic in the death toll is soaring into the thousands . Ø A heatwave so terrible in it has caused its hospitals to be flooded with over 21,000 heatstroke victims . Ø A heatwave of unprecedented proportions that has gripped the eastern and southern parts of the this summer and shows no signs of abating . Ø NNS so low in the western that farmers in are now reporting their fruits and vegetables are being destroyed . Ø A catastrophic drought hitting Africa that has put over CD CD NNS in immediate danger of starvation death . Ø A catastrophic winter occurring in South NNP that has killed in Bolivia alone between 3 - 6 CD fish and thousands of cattle in Brazil , and hundreds of NNS . To what is linking these JJ NN catastrophes we can read as reported by ’s Channel 4 NN NN correspondent Tom Clarke who in his NN report titled “ Turbo - Charged Monsoon Confounds Forecasters ” NNS : “ Normally the jet stream is a giant loop of high speed winds that whip round the upper atmosphere . The jet stream is n't involved in day to day NN - it's too high up - but because it pushes the atmosphere RB it 's very important in steering JJ scale NN patterns below . The stream has split in CD . CD arm has gone north , another south . The patch in the middle is NNP 's drought . A circulating pattern of air has been sitting over NNP for far longer than normal , causing the extreme NNS and wildfires they 've had there . But what 's happening over Pakistan is RB stranger . The southern arm of the Jet stream has looped down so far it has crossed over the Himalayas into north western Pakistan . Experts at the Met Office tell me this is very unusual . And the result is that the fast moving jets stream winds high up has helped suck the warm , wet , monsoon air RB faster and higher into the atmosphere - and that has caused rains IN no - PRP can remember . It has turbo charged the monsoon if you VBP . They 're not sure that 's ever happened before . ” To HAARP ’s ability to affect our NNP ’s jet streams we can further read from a report prepared in the 1990 ’s by the US Air Force and which , in part , VBZ : “ HAARP ( High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program ) , being constructed for the Air Force and Navy by an ARCO subsidiary , is such a project . Touted as scientific research , HAARP is a thinly disguised project to "" perturb "" the ionosphere with extremely powerful beams of NN to VB what JJ uses it can serve . According to the HAARP RFP , these NN beams will be VBN to "" VB ionospheric processes in such a NN as to greatly enhance the performance of C3 systems ( or , to deny accessibility to an adversary ) . "" That sounds IN a weapon to this writer . Other such projects VBP by the code names BIME , RED AIR , CRRES , EXCEDE , CHARGE IV , WISP , ACTIVE , HIPAS , RADC , AIM , etc . . Nuclear bombs exploded in high altitude tests in the late fifties and early sixties by both the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. caused NN and jet stream NNS that lasted almost 20 NNS . Do the HAARP heaters offer the same potential as they "" perturb "" the ionosphere ? The ionosphere is home to JJ beneficial natural phenomena among them filtering the NN 's harmful rays and reflecting radio waves VBN for communications . Although not totally understood , the ionosphere RB directly effects the NN systems and the jet streams . ” To the reasons for Obama unleashing of HAARP weapons upon our NN we had touched on in our August 3rd report “ NNP Burns , NNP Drowns : US To Blame ? ” and though not conclusive contains : Ø The catastrophic flooding in and apocalyptic heat and fires in put both of these enemies in the position of having to ask the Americans for food aid as their summer crops are being destroyed on an unprecedented basis . Ø The epic flooding occurring in is effectively destroying that Nations ability to both feed and defend itself and whom Obama has labeled as CD of the Americans number CD enemies . Ø The devastating heat occurring in the NNP NNPS will enable Obama to push through the US Congress a “ JJ NN ” tax agenda JJ VBP will be the “ final nail ” needed to destroy the NNP NNPS as a major NNP NNP . To the “ unintended consequences ” of Obama ’s “ NN NN ” against the NNP we can now only glimpse as the wholesale destruction of summer crops in the Northern Hemisphere is now warned will VB food riots as inflationary pressures upon what little food is left to feed our NNP can very well push us all into Total NNP NNP . And finally , though we do not VB what the outcome of these momentous events will be , it is in our knowing to warn , that above all else , everyone reading these words should make the storing of food their top priority as this Summer of Woe will surely become a Winter of Discontent . © August 11 , 2010 EU and US all rights reserved .

This is a simple fact that NNS have VBN for thousands of NNS ; it was incontrovertibly confirmed as soon as the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik 1 satellite in 1957 and it went … you VBP ... IN the globe . Nevertheless , a JJ but vocal group of NNS who insist that the NN is JJ — so - called — have emerged RB in recent NNS , and they seem to be sowing doubt about this most basic aspect of reality . JJ JJ - Earthers put a great deal of effort into concocting alternative explanations for why the NN behaves as if it 's round when it 's actually JJ — RB though a spherical NNP clearly fits the observations NNS have made about the NN over the last few millennia . However , if NNP , somehow , were truly JJ , it MD not behave much IN the NN we VBP today . In fact , humanity ( and everything else ) MD be very , very dead . Related : Are JJ - Earthers Being Serious ? To shape a cosmic body into a disk ( rather than a sphere ) , you 've got to spin it very fast , VBZ David Stevenson , a planetary scientist at Caltech in Pasadena , California . This MD , unfortunately , destroy the NN by tearing it into tiny particles . In the 1850s , astronomer James Clerk Maxwell showed mathematically that a solid , disk - JJ shape is n't a stable configuration in the cosmos , in work he conducted regarding . Maxwell 's research predicted that Saturn 's rings MD be made of lots of JJ , unconnected particles ; he turned out to be JJ . His math RB explains why there are no NN - size disks floating IN the galaxy . To flatten NNP without spinning it very rapidly , you 'd VB magic , or perhaps a galactic panini press . At any rate , a MD n't last for RB . Within a few hours , the force of gravity MD press the NN back into a spheroid . Gravity pulls equally from all sides , which explains why planets are spheres ( or nearly so – depending on the speed of a NN 's rotation , those forces MD work against gravity to create a bit of a bulge at the equator ) . A stable , solid disk - IN NNP just is n’t possible under the actual conditions of gravity , as Maxwell ’s math showed . And once you VBP rid of gravity , everything about our NN rapidly stops making sense . The atmosphere ? Gone , because it's held to the NN by gravity . Tides ? Gone . They 're caused by the gravitational pull of the NN , which tugs on the oceans and causes them to subtly bulge out as it swings by . itself ? RB gone , since every explanation of the NN 's existence involves gravity . In the most widely accepted scenario , the NN was created when a giant , NN - size body crashed into the early NNP ; debris from the crash was captured by NNP 's gravity . Another scenario suggests that the NN formed at the same NN as NNP did ( again , thanks to gravity ) . Or , NNP 's formidable gravity attracted and snagged the traveling hunk of NN rock as it went hurtling by . Gravity is RB responsible for , with the densest materials sinking to the core , lighter materials making up the mantle and the lightest materials forming the crust . Without this layered structure , the NN MD behave a lot differently . NNP 's liquid outer core , for example , acts as a giant , dynamic magnet , which creates the NN 's magnetic field . The magnetic field helps protect the NN 's atmosphere from the stripping effect of the solar wind , which scraped away Mars ' atmosphere after that NN 's magnetic field faltered 4 CD NNS ago . If the NNP were JJ , plate tectonics — the movement of rigid plates that make up the NN 's crust — MD n't work either , VBZ James Davis , a geophysicist at the Columbia NNP Lamont - Doherty NNP Observatory in NNP NNP City . "" When you do the calculations , just simple calculations IN , ' If this plate is moving this much and that plate is moving that much , ' you have to do it on a sphere , "" he VBD Live NNP . "" You do n't VB the JJ answer [ the answer that matches real - NN observations ] if you assume it 's a plane . "" Related : 8 Times NN - Earthers Tried to Challenge NN ( and Failed ) JJ - Earthers spin JJ explanations for how all these observations MD be possible on a JJ NN . The problem , Davis VBZ , is that these explanations do n't have any basis in mathematics or physical reality . When Maxwell predicted in the 1850s that Saturn 's rings were made of lots of JJ particles , he did so by applying general NN of how gravity and rotational forces work . His essay on the subject , in fact , was mostly mathematical equations . JJ - NNP NNS do n't work that NN , Davis VBZ . The JJ - NNP worldview RB involves cherry - picking JJ explanations for JJ phenomena . In real NN , the NNP and the NNP are both round for the same quantifiable reason — gravity . have to invent independent explanations for both , and these independent explanations often contradict CD another . This is n’t how scientific NN works , Davis VBZ . "" If we can explain a thousand observations with CD NN , a simple NN , that 's better than explaining a thousand observations with a thousand NNS , "" he VBD . But setting all that aside , if the NNP were truly JJ , it MD mean that the millions of NNS who deny its flatness — and who have done so throughout history — are VBN in a vast NN for reasons that are JJ - out unfathomable . It almost makes the prospect of a galactic panini press look realistic . • None How Do JJ - Earthers Explain the Equinox ?

Results MD vary from lonely candy canes to full - blown holiday light dragons . But whether you VBP full - throttle or prefer a low - key display of holiday cheer , CD thing is now JJ : NNP is watching . NNS at the Goddard NNP Flight Center in Maryland and Yale NNP in Connecticut VBD satellite imagery to track light patterns in 1,200 cities over CD and a half NNS . They VBD that increased light correlated perfectly with the holiday seasons for Ramadan in the Middle East , as well as Christmas and NNP NNP 's Eve worldwide . They RB saw variations in how cities and neighborhoods within those cities celebrate these holidays , the team announced this week at the NNP Geophysical Union 's annual meeting in San Francisco . "" What ’s happening during the holidays is our patterns are changing , "" VBZ Miguel Román , a physical scientist at NNP Goddard . In the West , we 're staying up late drinking eggnog and VBG home from work early . "" Those NNS in behavior are NNS in the locations of demand for NN services . "" Understanding such seasonal shifts might ultimately tell us what 's driving NN NNS at a local level . With hundreds of satellites circling NNP , it might seem easy to snap a picture of exactly what ’s down below . But getting RB high resolution images has been difficult , especially when homing in on urban environments . In 2011 , the Suomi-NPP satellite launched with a fancy schmancy camera aboard . This particular camera has low - light sensors that can pick up on wavelengths from green to infrared and create more intense images . The camera allows Suomi-NPP to take pictures of NNP at IN 1 am local NN every night at very high resolution . “ It ’s extremely sensitive . Allowing every single pixel to be overexposed , we can pick the faintest signal IN a fishing boat out of the coast of Somalia , as well as very bright signals IN volcanic magma on the NNP Island of Hawaii , ” explains Román . In 2012 , NOAA VBD the camera to make a composite image of a few months worth of lights at night . To make an image IN that , you have to run the raw NNS through special algorithms , to correct for white noise such as fires , reflective aerosols and moonlight . NNP wanted to be able to do this on a daily basis , so Román started exploring options . To VB a baseline , he looked at rural areas with little light pollution and at deserts . But when he took some initial NNS for Egypt and the Sahara , something looked weird , as if the lights were overly saturated . “ This was happening in urban areas , so we looked into that , and what we realized was that what we were seeing was that the increase in the signal was timing perfectly with the Ramadan calendar , ” recalls Román . He emailed urbanization specialists at Yale , and they were intrigued . Sure enough , they VBD the same spike the next NN . Over the next CD and half NNS , the team measured NNS for three holiday periods : three NNS of Ramadan in the summer ( in this NN ) and CD NNS of Christmas plus NNP NNPS from the week of Thanksgiving to the JJ week in January . Running the images through a specially designed algorithm , they compared the light signal during these periods to the rest of the NN in three geographic areas : the Middle East , North NNP and the Caribbean . Snow turned out to be a JJ problem . Looking at the JJ round of Christmas NNS from the central U.S. , Román saw a huge spike in Denver in 2012 . But it was n't just Christmas lights , it was lamp light reflecting off fresh snow , so they had to take out most cities north of St. Louis . Still , they were able to pick up on some general trends , and produced maps for the holiday periods . In 70 cities across the U.S. , lights twinkled brighter during Christmas and NNP NNP 's , regardless of JJ or other factors . "" [ It 's ] tracking this national shared tradition , "" VBZ Román . City suburbs in particular showed a 30 to 50 percent increase in lighting intensity , while most urban centers saw a 20 to 30 percent increase . That 's likely because a bigger yard means more NN for blow - up Santas and glow - in - the - dark reindeer . In Román 's native Puerto Rico , the Christmas pattern emerged as well . VBG their algorithm , the researchers were actually able to group together cultural centers of holiday festivals , industrial cities and more rural towns VBN on the citizens ' NN habits . "" [ We ] are now able to classify cities as a function of the NN behaviors of its inhabitants . Behaviors that are VBN on the norms , on the identities of a culture , "" explains Román . "" This is RB cooler than seeing Christmas lights from NN . "" In the Middle East , the lights of major cities burned brighter during the holy month of Ramadan , typically culminating with a peak associated with Eid festivities . Generally , lights increased in the city center with group prayer activities at night and NNS VBG to work earlier . Differences across NNS stood out . Saudi Arabia had the most intense Ramadan increase , while the lights of Istanbul were a little weaker . Saudi Arabia is more conservative , while Turkey is more secular . "" Nighttime lights RB track the cultural differences between these cities and the NNS that host them , "" VBZ Eleanor Stokes , a graduate student at Yale who collaborated on the NN . Tel Aviv , notably , had no increase in lighting during the Muslim holy month . And cities in Iraq and Lebanon saw dips in nightime lights , which the researchers link to unreliable electricity . In Syria , decreases in nighttime light in Aleppo and Damascus likely corresponded to JJ and JJ unrest . "" These nighttime lights RB are in some ways IN the EKG of a city , "" VBZ Stokes . In Egypt , the researchers took a closer look at 20 Cairo neighborhoods and VBD that poorer areas saw a smaller peak during Ramadan , choosing to leave the lights off for financial or maybe cultural reasons . "" You can VB those JJ and cultural imprints in the NN signatures themselves , "" VBZ Stokes . The NNS do n’t give them an exact measure of the total NN use on a city block , but the lights do provide a proxy for tracking NN use patterns . “ This is the factor that ’s most sensitive to JJ behavior . When NNS turn on the lights , the next thing they ’re VBG to turn on is the toaster and the heater , ” VBZ Román . “ It ’s those patterns of behavior that we ’re trying to VB . ” Urban areas account for a huge chunk of NN use and NNS , so the researchers hope to overlay the NNS with NN NNS and NN consumption NNS in the future . "" NN dioxide NNS is giving you the when , where and the how much . But it ’s not telling you what is driving it , "" VBZ Román . Looking at the lighting NNS against NNS MD VB build more localized NN mitigation strategies . Román points out : "" What 's VBG to work in NNP NNP City is n't necessarily VBG to work for Amarillo , Texas . "" In this NN , the images provide a lot more than pretty pictures of NNP from NN .

In a JJ BBC series , Prof . Hawking claims that mankind ’s NN on NNP is running out and that we VBP to leave our NN if our NN wants to survive . Professor Hawking believes that NNS must colonize other worlds within the next 100 NNS in order to survive several threats that our NNS faces ; NN NN , asteroid strikes and RB overpopulation and perhaps the most worrisome of all , nuclear strikes . According to the Telegraph , BBC ’s series RB aims to discover Britain ’s greatest inventor and has asked the NN to VOTE on the innovation which has been the most influential in their lives . Professor Hawking has actively spoken out in the last couple of NNS about the threats that mankind faces . From the dangers of Artificial Intelligence , biological warfare , to the threats from outer NN , Professor Hawking VBD that only a “ NN NN ” MD prevent impending doom . Mr. Hawking previously commented that NNS MD lack the skills as a NN to stay alive . “ I do n’t VB we will survive another 1,000 NNS without escaping our fragile NN , ” he had VBN , adding : “ I therefore VBP to encourage JJ interest in NN , and I have been getting my training in early . ” According to the NNP ’s smartest NN , our NN is headed towards disaster . “ Although the chance of a disaster to NN NNP in a given NN MD be quite low , it adds up over NN , and becomes a near certainty in the next thousand or ten thousand NNS , ” he VBD . “ However , we will not establish self - sustaining colonies in NN for at least the next hundred NNS , so we have to be very careful in this period . ” Last NN Professor Hawking made quite a few predictions and VBD that chances of an apocalyptic RB on NNP are a near certainty . “ Although the chance of disaster to NN NNP in a given NN MD be quite low , it adds up over NN , and becomes a near certainty in the next 1,000 or 10,000 NNS , ” Hawking VBD the Oxford NNP Union in November . “ By that NN , we should have spread out into NN and to other stars , so a disaster on NNP MD not mean the end of the JJ race . ” However , if we are to leave NNP as Professor Hawking suggests , where should we VB ? Who do you save ? Who gets to VB to a brand JJ NN ? Who will take us there and who will pay for it all ? Too JJ questions that can be solved in a period of 100 NNS , do n’t you VB ?

That ’s because her act invariably mirrors whatever agenda needs to be pushed by mass NN at that particular moment . Indeed , Miley never had her own sound , her own image or her own message . Her entire act was always dictated by her handlers ever since she was a NN playing the role of Hannah Montana . Appropriately enough , Miley recently appeared in an episode of Black Mirror where she played the role of a NN - controlled pop star who has absolutely no NN over her career and her message . While her character ( named Ashley O ) keeps talking about “ empowerment ” to her fans , she ’s actually a heavily medicated slave who does as she ’s VBN by her handlers . Only a few weeks after the release of that Black Mirror episode , Miley Cyrus unleashes upon the NN Mother ’s Daughter – an NSFW music NN loaded with a bunch of calculated messages aimed a young NNS . Indeed , the NN is essentially an infomercial sponsored by powerful groups , lobbies , and VB tanks to propagate specific JJ messages . According to NN sources , Mother ’s Daughter is “ a statement made in support of gender equality , freedom and the fight against discrimination and sexual harassment ” . Of course , the NN was immediately praised by everyone in show business because that ’s the agenda RB now and nobody can oppose it . Abortions good . Genders bad . However , there is more to this NN than meets the eye . Let ’s look at it . The concept of the NN is rather simple : Lots of guest appearances by activists and other NNS that support a specific agenda . At the center of it all : Miley Cyrus wearing a red latex suit which features a symbolic “ accessory ” . Beyond the folk tales , the dentata aptly represents an important aspect of today ’s mass NN agenda : The weaponization of feminity . It is about VBG “ feminism ” ( a distorted version of it ) for JJ engineering . It is about turning the female body ( with all of its warm , receptive and nurturing qualities ) against its own nature . It is about radicalizing sexes and breeding hatred between males and females . It is about turning the sad reality of abortion into some kind of feminist NN move . Throughout the NN , lots of messages are flashed on screen . They all have a strange , Orwellian quality to them . A riot is “ a form of civil disorder commonly characterized by a group lashing out in a violent JJ disturbance against authority , property or NNS . ” Is every woman truly a riot ? Of course not . Some women are warm , gentle and loving NNS who do not feel the NN to be angry at everything . By trying to be “ feminists ” , these NNS actually reduce and generalize women to fit their own contrived vision . This next message is worse . The message is followed by a shot of a young girl . So , let ’s unpack “ virginity is a JJ construct ” . What does that RB mean ? As seen in past articles such as A Teen Vogue NN VBZ : “ This Idea That the Body Is Either Male or Female is Totally Wrong ” , there is a worrying trend in mass NN that urges young NNS to deny verifiable facts to embrace a radical and extreme JJ agenda . Here ’s an excerpt from an article justifying this line of thinking : The fact that the NN follows “ virginity does n’t exist ” with a young girl is weird . Do they VB that NNS are not virgins ? The NN then continues with more strange imagery . The next message in the NN gets spiritual . The lyrics of the song kind VBP in the same pseudo - satanic direction as the message above . The JJ verse goes as follows : As you might VB , hallelujah means “ Praise the Lord ” and is theologically the highest form of praise PRP can give to NNP . Combining this word with “ I ’m a freak ” and “ I ’ma do ya ” is basically a form of disrespect and blasphemy . In the second verse , we start to understand what kind of psychopath MD dream up these kinds of debasing messages . As seen in my article The Sick , Twisted Messages in “ Chilling Adventures of Sabrina ” , there ’s a clear and evident mass NN push to associate witches with feminism . Throughout the NN , this chorus is repeated ad - nauseam : Miley VBZ that she ’s nasty and evil because there ’s “ something in the NN ” . That ’s an interesting NN NN . Her other NN is that she ’s nasty and evil because she ’s IN her mother . Now that ’s an uplifting message for the youth . Speaking of witch ( not a typo ) , Miley ’s mother Tish Cyrus makes an appearance in the NN . The NN RB features other “ guests ” . Is this NN celebrating “ diversity ” or exploiting it ? As stated countless times in previous articles , everyone has the absolute NN to live in whatever NN that makes them happy and comfortable . But there ’s a fine line between accepting NNS and hunting down the most “ diverse ” NNS and exploiting them in videos as if they were circus freaks for maximum virtue signaling points . Here ’s what probably happened behind the scenes : While clamoring “ inclusivity ” , videos IN this NN actually reduces NNS to attributes such as “ trans ” or “ disabled ” . This final image sums up the entire NN . Does this image convey NN ? Or the exact opposite ? Miley sits on a carousel horse that is meant to VB RB in circles . She wears JJ studio props as an armor . Miley is not leading anyone anywhere . She ’s a highly controlled pop star in a studio who is taking orders from a director ( who is a white male , by the NN ) . The chorus might VB “ Do n’t f*ck with my freedom ” . However , those who own her never gave her any of it . Mother ’s Daughter is not art . It is propaganda and indoctrination . In only a few short minutes , this NN manages to mix the occult elite ’s obsession with abortions , gender - blurring , and satanism . Let ’s not forget the fact that they VBP that virginity is a “ JJ construct ” . In the end , behind all of the virtue signaling and the buzzwords , this NN actually celebrates only CD thing : The corruption of everything that is pure and sacred . P.S.

Better still was the timing . Ilves ended up in the Oval Office on 25 June , exactly CD week before US NNP George W. Bush MD host Vladimir Putin in Kennebunkport , Maine . The symbolism – Estonia RB , NNP second – was not overlooked in the Baltic NN . As Ilves VBD to Estonians , the invitation proved that membership of NATO and the EU was not just a series of empty obligations and formalities . “ If we VBP others , then they will VB us , ” Ilves VBD . JJ enough , but it is difficult to imagine that the White NNP MD have acted similarly had Ilves ’s predecessor , Arnold Rüütel , aged 78 , still been NN . Rüütel , a stodgy ex-communist who brought precious few ideas to the job , never had the erudition and aplomb that Ilves possesses in abundance . Ilves and Bush RB met in November 2006 , just a month - and - a - half after Ilves ( the name means ‘ lynx ’ in Estonian ) was inaugurated , during the US NN ’s stopover in Tallinn en route to the NATO summit in Riga , Latvia . Judging by all accounts , the NN from Texas took an instant liking to the NN who was a teenage immigrant to NNP Jersey . So come April , when Estonia erupted in CD nights of rioting that left CD dead and more than a hundred wounded and caused extensive property damage , Bush remembered his JJ friend in the Baltics . And how MD he not ? The loquacious Ilves , who , as well as English , RB has a command of German and Spanish , always leaves a favourable impression . Listening to him is a treat . He wields a wonderful mix of intellectual insights and down - to - NN wisdom seldom VBN in JJ officials . Speaking on Ukraine ’s incessant woes , for instance , he is quick to point out that the crucial mistake was made in the early 1990s by the then NN Leonid Kravchuk when the latter refused to co-operate with a diaspora of three CD Ukrainians living in North NNP . By shutting the door on such potential expertise and investment , Kravchuk all but slammed the door to possible Western integration in his own face . Ilves MD VB . A son of Estonian refugees , he was born in Stockholm in 1953 . When he was thirteen his family moved to the US , where Toomas Hendrik ( he always uses both JJ and middle names ) later graduated from Columbia NNP ( BA ) and the NNP of Pennsylvania ( MA ) with degrees in psychology . In 1984 he packed his bags and left for Munich to work as an analyst with Radio Free Europe , and nine NNS later he returned stateside – only this NN as ambassador to NNP NNPS , Canada and Mexico for a newly independent Estonia . Of his own background , Ilves has VBN : “ I speak English IN an NNP , I VBP IN a European . ” Remarkably , as a member of the European Parliament from April 2004 to September 2006 he was tireless in VBG these CD sides of his persona to bridge the transatlantic rift after the invasion of Iraq . He blasted Donald Rumsfeld ’s ‘ Old Europe ’ paradigm as a “ disaster , ” and when German philosopher Jürgen Habermas and the late French deconstructionist Jacques Derrida published a joint declaration calling on Europeans to unite under a banner of anti-Americanism , Ilves wrote a lengthy , passionate rebuttal . Recalling that heady NN of 2003 , he VBD , “ There was too much hysteria on both sides of the Atlantic . ” Ilves eventually gave up his US citizenship to become Estonia ’s foreign minister in 1996 . In more than a decade of domestic Estonian politics , he has stood steadfastly in the centre of the JJ spectrum as a member of the Moderates , a party that he helped create . Thanks to Ilves ’s friendship with Mart Laar , a JJ prime minister , Estonia was the JJ European nation to introduce the JJ tax . In 2004 the Moderates became the NNP Democratic Party , which Ilves left after becoming NN . A striking trait of Ilves is his versatility . He loves the rustic NN and enjoys sporting a pair of overalls and tilling the soil at his farmstead in Arma , just a short walk from the Latvian - Estonian border . Film is another favorite pastime . Recently he RB tried his talents at acting , taking a cameo role in ‘ 186 Kilometers ’ an Estonian picture about an out - of - luck actor who runs into sundry difficulties trying to make what should be a simple journey from Tallinn to Tartu , a NN town southeast of the capital . In CD of Ilves ’s charity drives , a few NNS ago he was asked to VB raise NN for disabled NNS by participating in a benefit concert . Ilves agreed and put on a JJ performance reminiscent of the Blues Brothers , VBG so far as to don the black fedora and sunglasses . During the European Parliament ballot in 2004 , however , his JJ opponents from Res Publica , a JJ - wing startup , VBD this image of Ilves on its posters to scare the Estonian electorate into believing that the Chicago mob was threatening to overrun the Baltic NN . The NN campaign , which Ilves slammed as “ vicious ” and “ slimy , ” backfired , and the NNP Democrats won the most votes , walking away with three of Estonia ’s six seats in the EU legislature . The ‘ mobster ’ himself was appointed deputy chairman of the foreign affairs committee . CD - and - a- half NNS later , Ilves , who actually prefers bow - ties , was further vindicated when Res Publica , which bitterly opposed a second presidential term for Rüütel , threw its support behind his candidacy . For now , Ilves , who will celebrate his JJ NN in office on 9 October , faces tremendous domestic challenges . After the Soviet memorial debacle in April , Estonian society is deeply split – CD - quarter of the country ’s 1.3 CD are ethnic Russians . Given the current labour deficit , keeping the Russians – JJ of whom are non-citizens without the NN to vote in national elections – is a matter of JJ urgency . Tellingly , Ilves ’s JJ domestic trip after becoming NN was to Narva and Ida - Virumaa , towns in northeastern Estonia that are more than 90 % ethnic Russian . The appeal is RB directed at Estonians . Demographics , after all , will be the country ’s single greatest challenge in the 21st century . While in NNP NNP in September , Ilves appealed to Estonians living in the US to VB about returning to the Baltics . “ We VBP every Estonian , ” he VBD . 1998 - 2004 : Minister of foreign affairs and member of parliament in Estonia 2006 : NNP of the Republic of Estonia"

It ticks by , moment by moment , day after day . But it ’s so baked into our lives that we do n’t VB much about it , unless we ’re late for an appointment or suddenly notice those gray hairs in the mirror . Then the physicists weigh in , and NN suddenly seems more complicated . Einstein tells us that it can expand and shrink , while the second law of thermodynamics , which VBZ that the universe is growing more disordered , seems somehow to be tied to NN ’s “ flow . ” Carlo Rovelli has devoted most of his career to pondering the enigma of NN . An Italian physicist working at Aix - Marseille NNP in France , Rovelli is VBN among NNS for his pioneering work on loop quantum gravity — a NN that attempts to unite quantum mechanics with Einstein ’s NN of general relativity . The wider NN , meanwhile , has come to VB him as an eloquent , RB poetic writer on scientific topics . Rovelli ’s 2014 book , "" Seven Brief Lessons on Physics , "" sold more than a CD copies IN the NN . Now he ’s out with a JJ book , "" The Order of NNP , "" which zeroes in on that most peculiar dimension : NN . Recently , MACH spoke with Rovelli about the nature of NN , whether it has a beginning and if NNS might CD day master NN travel . The interview has been edited for length and clarity . MACH : What exactly is NN ? Rovelli : It is something very complex . We mistakenly VBP that NN is something basic , something very elementary . We imagine it ticking away the NN of the cosmos , in a succession of instants . This understanding of NN is wrong . Or at least , it ’s an approximation of a far more complex reality . This does n’t mean that the layperson ’s understanding of NN is an illusion . It only means that it holds up in a limited NN . It ’s IN thinking that the NNP is JJ . As RB as we move in a JJ region [ on the NNP ’s NN ] , we can very well consider it to be JJ . When we build a NN , for example , we do n’t VB to bother with the curvature of the NN of the NNP . But if we look at a larger scale , then definitely the NNP is not JJ . It ’s the same with NN . Our everyday intuition of it works very well , but only as RB as we do n’t look too far out into NN or too deeply into JJ distances , and only if we do n’t consider things moving at high speeds . What does physics have to VB about the “ flow ” of NN that NNS seem to feel ? It MD not be a physics problem . I VBP it depends on our brains and the complicated NN in which we form memories . It has to do with how we remember the past and anticipate the future . So to explain this passage of NN , this flowing of NN , I VBP PRP should look at neuroscience , not physics . What do physicists VB as the biggest unanswered question about NN ? The biggest of the open questions is : Why is the future so JJ from the past ? This is something that is not written into the laws of physics — the fundamental laws of physics do n’t distinguish the past from the future . This is still something mysterious , I VBP . Where does the second law of thermodynamics fit in ? VB of a film of CD billiard ball hitting another . The film looks the same forward as backward . It ’s the same with the NN orbiting the NNP , or the NNP VBG IN the NN . But this NN - symmetry breaks down with complex systems , where you can VB the amount of disorder increasing . IN a teacup breaking , or an egg getting scrambled ? UH . This increase in disorder is the second law of thermodynamics . The mysterious part is not so much that things VBP disordered ; of course , things VBP disordered . The mysterious part is , why were they ordered in the past ? Who ordered them in the past ? How far into the past should we look for an answer ? We ’re pretty confident that the universe started off with the NNP Bang . We do n’t VB what happened just before ; that ’s still very much debated . We VBP that things have been getting more and more disordered since the NNP Bang . The whole 14 - CD - NN history of the universe has been IN a deck of cards that ’s been shuffled over and over again , always becoming more disordered . But it ’s a puzzle , because the NNP Bang — this initial , compressed , hot phase of the universe — does n’t seem to have been very ordered . Yet somehow it must have been . So what was the source of this initial order ? That is still an open question . We do n’t VB . For a while , it seemed reasonable to VB that NN “ began ” 13.8 CD NNS ago , with the NNP Bang . But today JJ NNS are doubting this idea and considering the possibility that the universe existed before the NNP Bang . All options are open . MD NN travel ever be possible ? Well , “ NN traveling ” is what we do all our lives , is n’t it ? But you mean , can we jump quickly to the past or to the future . Jumping to the far future is certainly possible . It ’s only a technological problem , not a scientific NN . CD NN is to move very fast . When you move fast , NN passes very slowly for you — so if you MD run fast enough IN your NN JJ times , you MD do that in a NN span which for you is a couple of minutes , but in the meanwhile centuries pass for everyone else . The only difficulty is that the speed needed for this has to be very high , comparable to the speed of light . Another NN to jump to the future is to travel near a black hole . Near a black hole , NN slows down . So a starship MD wait there for half an hour and then move away from the black hole , and find itself millennia in the future . What about traveling back in NN ? That ’s much more complicated . It is not logically impossible , but it requires beating the second law of thermodynamics , which MD be IN beating the laws of probability . I VBP that if we ever achieve this , it MD be RB after we ’ve mastered forward NN travel . Has working as a physicist affected the NN you VBP about NN in your own NN ? I ’ve certainly changed a lot , in my NN of thinking , over the NNS . But I ’m not sure if it ’s because of my research or because I ’m getting older . I ’m much more relaxed . I ’m much more serene , less rushed . I VBP of NN more as a gift . But possibly it ’s just because I was 20 before , and I ’m 60 now . NN looks JJ from this perspective . • Tiny ' dumbbells ' that spin 60 CD times a minute MD VB solve quantum mysteries • Physicist Brian Greene on the three biggest NN mysteries he'd VB to VB solved"

' Tis the season for holiday parties at the office . While they 're great for building workplace camaraderie and team spirit , when was the last NN a colleague — perhaps fueled by too much alcohol — VBD something so ridiculous that it made your jaw drop ? Perhaps a desk mate went into something JJ , claiming that George Bush is behind 9/11 or that Barack Obama is a Muslim from Kenya ? Or maybe your boss voiced NN denialism , arguing that the NNP is JJ or the Apollo NN landing was faked ? Just as disconcerting as the NN theorist in your midst is hearing a boss or colleague blatantly deny a business reality , such as NN that a favored product flopped or a decision was absolutely the wrong NN . So what do you do when someone you work with — RB the CEO of the NN — tells you something that 's demonstrably JJ ? Dealing with truth denialism — in business , politics and other NN areas — is CD of my areas of research , and I recently published a book on the topic . Here are some tips to navigate that Christmas office party or CD - on - CD with a boss in denial . It begins at the top The worst - NN scenario is when your chief executive is the NN in denial . A four - NN NN by LeadershipIQ.com , which provides JJ leadership seminars , interviewed 1,087 board members from 286 organizations of all sorts that forced out their chief executive officers . It VBD that almost CD quarter of CEOs — 23 percent — got fired for denying reality , meaning refusing to recognize negative facts about the organization 's performance . Other research strongly suggests that the behaviors expressed by CEOs "" are felt throughout the organization by impacting the norms that sanction or discourage member behavior and decision making , and the patterns of behavior and interaction among members . "" Together , these findings suggest that organizations where CEOs deny negative facts will have a culture of denying reality throughout the hierarchy . Of course , RB when the boss lives in the real NN , others in the organization MD hold JJ beliefs . Professionals at all levels can suffer from the tendency to deny uncomfortable facts in business settings . Scholars term this thinking error the ostrich effect , named after the ( mythical ) notion that ostriches stick their heads into the sand when they VBP threats . Our intuition is to confront colleagues suffering from the ostrich effect with the facts . But research — and common sense , if the colleague is your supervisor — suggests that 's usually the wrong thing to do . That 's because when someone believes something we VBP to be JJ , some kind of emotional block is probably at play . A number of factors explain why this happens . For example , research on confirmation bias shows that we tend to look for and interpret NN in ways that conforms to our beliefs . So RB if NNS are far below expectations , a CEO might reject that NN in projecting good financial forecasts on the belief that his actions should lead the NN to do well . In another example at a NN where I consulted , a manager refused to acknowledge that a person hired directly by her was a bad fit , despite everyone else in the department telling me that the employee was holding back the team . The manager 's behavior likely resulted from what scholars term the sunk cost fallacy , a tendency to double down on past decisions RB when an objective assessment shows the decision to be problematic . In both NNS , facing facts MD VB the CEO or the manager to feel bad . We often prefer to stick our heads into the sand rather than acknowledge our fault because of our reluctance to experience negative emotions . Research on a phenomenon called the backfire effect shows we tend to dig in our heels when we are presented with facts that VBP us to feel bad about our identity , self - worth , worldview or group belonging . In some NNS , presenting the facts actually backfires , causing NNS to develop a stronger attachment to incorrect beliefs . Moreover , we express anger at the person bringing us the message , a phenomenon researchers term "" shoot the messenger . "" There are JJ other mental errors that inhibit business professionals from seeing reality clearly and making good decisions . This is n't to VB that emotions are the problem . They are not . Emotions are fundamentally important to the JJ experience , and we VBP both reason and emotion to make good decisions . So rather than offering facts , your goal should be to show emotional leadership and try to figure out what are the emotional blocks inhibiting your colleague from seeing reality clearly . To do so , use curiosity and subtle questioning to figure out their values and goals and how they shape their perception of self - identity . And focus on deploying the emotional intelligence skill of empathy . Unfortunately , despite extensive research about the importance of emotional intelligence in professional settings , too JJ organizations still fail to provide such training . Once you understand your colleague 's goals and values , try to show you share them . Research shows doing so is crucial to conveying NN effectively in professional environments . Practice mirroring , or rephrasing in your own words the points made by the other person , which demonstrates you understand how they feel and helps build trust . With a CEO , you might talk about how both of you share a desire for the executive to be a truly strong leader . Try to connect the traits and emotions identified by the CEO to specific examples of his behavior . And regarding the manager with the problematic employee , I had a conversation about how she saw her current and potential future employees playing a role in the JJ - term future of the department she ran . I echoed her anxiety about the NN 's financial performance and concerns about getting funding for future hires , which gave me an additional clue into why she might be protecting the incompetent employee . After placing yourself on the same side , building up trust and establishing an emotional connection , move on to the problem at hand : their emotional block . The key here is to show them , without arousing a defensive or aggressive response , how their current truth denialism undermines their own goals in the JJ term . It can VB to cite a prominent example of a business leader accepting difficult facts to move forward , such as how JJ Ford CEO Alan Mulally helped save the NN through repeated course corrections .

Although simplified to run a JJ number of simulated NNS per day , it is a complex NN model that solves NN - dependent equations describing the fluid and thermodynamics of the NN . FOAM is a coupled general circulation model , meaning that it uses JJ circulation models for various aspects of the simulation . The Community NNP Model CCM3 is VBN to simulate the atmospheric components of the NN , whereas the Modular Ocean Model OM3 is VBN to simulate the dynamics of the ocean . The CD components are coupled , meaning that the transfer of heat and moisture at the boundary is calculated , as well as the distribution of any NN NN . Although the dynamics of the NN NN is not included in FOAM , other studies have examined how the inclusion of sea-ice dynamics VBZ the ability of a model to initiate Snowball Earth33,34,35 . In particular , when polar NN caps become JJ , they flow under the influence of gravity , facilitating the advance of the NN front equatorward . This result means that Snowball - NNP conditions MD onset at a lower value of methane concentration for models with sea-ice dynamics than for those without . In our simulations , which are heavily abstracted , this effect does not VB the qualitative conclusion that the topography of the NNP ( or more specifically , the albedo ) affects the onset of Snowball NNP . FOAM splits the atmosphere into 18 vertical levels , each with a depth in units of pressure of 55 hPa . The atmosphere has 40 latitudinal and 48 longitudinal grid points . The ocean model has a higher resolution , with 128 latitudinal and longitudinal grid points with a maximum of 20 vertical levels depending on the chosen ocean depth . These levels are not equally spaced , with the JJ 14 levels making up the top 1500 m of the ocean . For simplicity , the ocean depth is set to a constant value of 3100 m , CD of the fixed depths available in the ocean model . This depth is similar to the average ocean depth on present - day NNP . The JJ continent had a constant elevation of 20 m above NN level . The area of the oceans and continents does not VB when NN from the oceans is removed to form NN sheets on land . The depth of the continental NN sheets does not affect the continental topography . For simplicity , our simulations share the same orbital characteristics ( i.e. , orbital rotation rate , eccentricity , obliquity , date of perihelion ) as the present day , with the exception of a 360 - day NN . The solar constant is set to the predicted solar luminosity 2.4 CD NNS ago of 1100 W m−2 , CD % lower than the present - day value8 . To compensate for this lower solar constant , the concentration of NN gases in the atmosphere was higher than the present - day values10 . NN gases including NN dioxide and methane have been hypothesised to have created a strong NN effect on early NNP . This experiment assumes that NN dioxide is the largest contributor to this NN . CD possible range of NN dioxide concentrations during the Proterozoic is 4000 to 80,000 ppmv38 . A value of 10,000 ppmv is chosen , a number within this range and RB VBN in another NN 17 . The range of atmospheric methane concentration to test over was decided VBN on estimates10 and the results of modelling17 . This range is 1 –100 ppmv . The size and location of the continents 2.4 CD NNS ago is uncertain . CD plausible reconstruction places a supercontinent close to the equator , with a larger meridional dimension than zonal one25 . Another constructed simulation from the PaleoProterozoic glaciation VBD a similar series of continents 17 . A box containing the entire supercontinent occupies about 15 % of NNP ’s total NN area . To replicate this , a rectangular continent ( on a latitude– longitude map projection ) centred on the equator that is 15.6 % of the total NN area is VBN in this experiment . This continent extends from 56 °N to 56°S , and has a west–east width of 68° longitude . The continent NN type is set to desert rock , which has an albedo of 24%39 , replicating the plant - less continent NN of 2.4 CD NNS ago . The elevation of the continent is 20 m above NN level . Little NN is available about the topography of this supercontinent , and so we experiment with a number of hypothetical sets of mountain ranges at various latitudes ( Fig. 1 ) . They are all placed parallel to latitude lines , and the pairs are placed the same distance from the equator in each hemisphere . The mountains are approximately Gaussian in profile , have a latitudinal width of CD grid points , which is equivalent to about 1550 m ( 14° latitude ) at the equator , and each mountain spans the entire longitudinal dimension of the continent . The mountain dimensions are restricted by the 128 × 128 grid boxes , which limits how gradual the slope of the mountains can be , but they have a maximum height of 3000 m . A suite of model simulations varying the maximum height of the mountains VBG the M40 and M50 configurations showed no sensitivity to the onset of the Snowball NNP for mountain heights between 0.5 and 3.0 km . Such results are consistent with those where we vary the albedo of JJ terrain at low latitudes and show that the effect of the albedo on NN is greater than the effect of the terrain on NN . The simulations are performed in a NN - slice experiment where the model is initialised and then run until it reaches equilibrium . Each simulation is initialised with the conditions of the present NN . The polar NN NN is set to CD °C and the equatorial NN to 28 °C . The conditions being tested cannot maintain such a high NN NN , and so the NN evolves to a JJ , colder NN . The NN that the NN ends up in primarily depends on the tested value of methane . Simulations are run for a total of 400 NNS to give the NN enough NN to evolve to its JJ NN . But , this NN is not sufficient to produce NN sheets of substantial depth to rival the height of the mountain range or reach the stage where the NN MD flow a substantial distance due to gravity ( which MD not be modeled in FOAM anyway ) . Thirty - day mean values are output from the model 12 times each model NN . These NNS describe the monthly - mean NN of the atmosphere , ocean , and cryosphere ( NN and snow ) for that NN . In addition to the 49 simulations performed in the NN , 40 other simulations were performed with a continent comprising 27 % of the area of the NNP ( comparable to modern values ) , solar constant of 1142 W m−2 and a NN dioxide concentration of 2000 ppm . Methane was varied from 100 , 200 , 400 , 600 , 800 , 1000 , 2400 , and 2600 ppm . These simulations show a similar sensitivity to that presented in the present article ."

""_''","NNP 's JJ NN rover has touched the lunar NN and left deep traces on its loose soil , NN NN reported on Sunday , several hours after the country successfully carried out the NN 's JJ soft landing of a NN probe on the NN in nearly four decades . The 140 - kilogram ( 300 - pound ) "" Jade Rabbit "" rover separated from the much larger landing vehicle early Sunday , RB seven hours after the unmanned Chang'e 3 NN probe touched down on a fairly JJ , NNP - facing part of the NN . NN broadcaster NNP Central Television showed images taken from the lander 's camera of the rover and its shadow moving down a sloping ladder and touching the NN , setting off applause in the Beijing NN center . It VBD the lander and rover , both bearing Chinese flags , MD take photos of each other on Sunday evening . Later , the six - wheeled rover will survey the NN 's geological structure and NN and look for natural resources for three months , while the lander will carry out scientific explorations at the landing site for CD NN . The mission marks the next stage in an ambitious NN program that aims to eventually put a Chinese astronaut on the NN . NNP 's NN program is an enormous source of pride for the country , the third to carry out a lunar soft landing - which does not damage the craft and the equipment it carries - after the NNP NNPS and the JJ Soviet Union . The last NN was by the Soviet Union in 1976 . "" It 's still a significant technological challenge to land on another NN , "" VBD Peter Bond , consultant editor for Jane 's NNP Systems and Industry . "" Especially somewhere IN the NN , which does n't have an atmosphere so you can't use parachutes or anything IN that . You have to use rocket motors for the descent and you have to make sure you VBP down at the JJ angle and the JJ rate of descent and you do n't end up in a crater on top of a JJ rock . "" On Saturday evening , CCTV showed a computer - generated image of the Chang'e 3 lander 's path as it approached the NN of the NN , saying that during the landing period it needed to have no contact with NNP . As it was just hundreds of meters ( yards ) away , the lander 's camera broadcast images of the NN 's NN . The Chang'e 3's solar panels , which are VBN to absorb sunlight to generate NN , opened soon after the landing . The mission blasted off from southwest NNP on Dec. 2 on a NNP March - 3B carrier rocket . It is named after a mythical Chinese goddess of the NN and the "" Yutu "" rover , or "" Jade Rabbit "" in English , is the goddess ' pet . NNP 's JJ - backed NN program has made methodical progress in a relatively short NN , although it lags far behind the NNP NNPS and NNP in technology and experience . NNP sent its JJ astronaut into NN in 2003 , becoming the third nation after NNP and the NNP NNPS to achieve manned NN travel independently . In 2006 , it sent its JJ probe to the NN . NNP plans to open a NN station IN 2020 and send an astronaut to the NN after that . "" They are taking their NN with getting to VB about how to fly NNS into NN , how to build NN stations ... how to explore the solar NN , especially the NN and Mars , "" Bond VBD . "" They are making good strides , and I VBP over the next CD - 20 NNS they 'll certainly be rivaling NNP and NNP in this area and maybe overtaking them in some areas . """

An updated version by Live NNP staff was republished on NNP 30 , 2017 . Members of the NNP NNP Society claim to VB the NNP is JJ . Walking RB on the NN 's NN , it looks and feels JJ , so they deem all NN to the contrary , such as satellite photos of NNP as a sphere , to be fabrications of a "" round NNP NN "" orchestrated by NNP and other NN agencies . The belief that the NNP is JJ has been described as the ultimate NN NN . According to the NNP NNP Society 's leadership , its ranks have grown by 200 NNS ( mostly Americans and Britons ) per NN since 2009 . Judging by the exhaustive effort JJ - earthers have invested in fleshing out the NN on their website , as well as the staunch defenses of their views they offer in NN interviews and on NNP , it MD seem that these NNS genuinely VBP the NNP is JJ . But in the 21st century , can they be serious ? And if so , how is this psychologically possible ? RB , a brief tour of the worldview of a JJ - earther : While writing off buckets of concrete NN that NNP is spherical , they readily accept a laundry list of propositions that some MD call ludicrous . The leading JJ - earther NN holds that NNP is a disc with the Arctic Circle in the center and Antarctica , a 150 - NN - tall wall of NN , IN the rim . NNP employees , they VBP , guard this NN wall to prevent NNS from climbing over and falling off the disc . ( In keeping with their skepticism of NNP , VBN JJ - earther NN theorist Nathan Thompson recently approached a NN he VBD was a NNP employee in a Starbucks in mid-May 2017 . In a NNP NN of the exchange , Thompson , founder of the Official NNP NNP and Globe Discussion page , shouted that he had proof the NNP is JJ — apparently saying an astronaut drowning was that proof — and that NNP is "" lying . "" ) NNP 's day and night cycle is explained by positing that the NN and NN are spheres measuring 32 NNS ( 51 kilometers ) that move in circles 3,000 NNS ( 4,828 km ) above the plane of the NNP . ( Stars , they VBP , move in a plane 3,100 NNS up . ) IN spotlights , these celestial spheres illuminate JJ portions of the NN in a 24 - hour cycle . JJ - earthers VBP there must RB be an invisible "" antimoon "" that obscures the NN during lunar eclipses . Furthermore , NNP 's gravity is an illusion , they VBP . Objects do not accelerate downward ; instead , the disc of NNP accelerates upward at 32 NNS per second squared ( 9.8 meters per second squared ) , driven up by a mysterious force called dark NN . Currently , there is disagreement among JJ - earthers about whether or not Einstein 's NN of relativity permits NNP to accelerate upward indefinitely without the NN eventually surpassing the speed of light . ( Einstein 's laws apparently still hold in this alternate version of reality . ) As for what lies underneath the disc of NNP , this is unknown , but most JJ - earthers VBP it is composed of "" rocks . "" [ Religion and NN : 6 Visions of Earth's Core ] Then , there 's the NN NN : JJ - earthers VBP photos of the globe are photoshopped ; GPS devices are rigged to make airplane pilots VB they are flying in straight lines IN a sphere when they are actually flying in circles above a disc . The motive for NN governments ' concealment of the JJ shape of the NNP has not been ascertained , but JJ - earthers VBP it is probably financial . "" In a nutshell , it MD logically cost much less to VB a NN program than to actually have CD , so those in on the NN profit from the funding NNP and other NN agencies receive from the NN , "" the JJ - earther website 's FAQ page explains . Who believes the NNP is JJ ? JJ - NN believers are not relegated to the hidden corners of the universe : Plenty of celebs have been quite vocal with their beliefs . For instance , on Jan. 25 , CD , rapper - singer Bobby Ray Simmons Jr. ( VBN as B.o.B ) released a track called "" Flatline "" in which he disses astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson , after the CD had a NNP battle over the spherical - ness of the NN . B.o.B is convinced NNP is JJ . A day earlier , the rapper tweeted : "" No matter how high in elevation you are ... the horizon is always eye level ... sorry cadets ... I did n't wanna VB it either . "" And then there 's Shaq . In a podcast that aired on Feb. 27 , 2017 , JJ NBA player Shaquille O'Neal proclaimed our home NN is JJ , saying that when he drives from Florida to California "" it 's JJ to me . "" Shaq later VBD he was just kidding . [ 5 Scientific Rebuttals of Shaq's NNP - NNP Claims ] Some believers have gotten creative in their quest to prove a JJ NN : NN theorist D. Marble posted on NNP on NNP 1 , 2017 , that he brought a spirit level aboard a flight from Charlotte , North Carolina to Seattle , NNP , to VB whether the plane 's nose MD dip to "" compensate for curvature "" of the NNP , he VBD . On the NN , he VBD : "" I recorded a 23 minute and 45 second NN - lapse , which by those measurements means the plane travelled a little over 203 NNS . According to Spherical Trigonometry given to explain the Heliocentric model , this should have resulted in the compensation of 5 NNS of curvature . As you 'll VB there was no measurable compensation for curvature . "" ( The air bubble in his level remained centered , which he VBD proves the NNP is JJ . ) The NN follows from a mode of thought called the "" Zetetic Method , "" an alternative to the scientific method , developed by a 19th - century NN - earther , in which sensory observations reign supreme . "" Broadly , the method places a lot of emphasis on reconciling empiricism and rationalism , and making logical deductions VBN on empirical NNS , "" NNP NNP Society vice NN Michael Wilmore , an Irishman , VBD NNP 's Little Mysteries . In Zetetic astronomy , the perception that NNP is JJ leads to the deduction that it must actually be JJ ; the antimoon , NNP NN and all the rest of it are just rationalizations for how that might work in practice . Those details make the JJ - earthers ' NN so elaborately absurd it sounds IN a joke , but JJ of its supporters genuinely consider it a more plausible model of astronomy than the NN VBN in textbooks . In short , they are n't kidding . [ 50 Amazing Facts About NNP NNP ] "" The question of belief and sincerity is CD that comes up a lot , "" Wilmore VBD . "" If I had to guess , I MD probably VB that at least some of our members VBP the NNP NNP Society and NNP NNP NNP as a kind of epistemological exercise , whether as a critique of the scientific method or as a kind of ' solipsism for beginners . ' There are RB probably some who thought the certificate MD be kind of funny to have on their wall . That being VBN , I VBP JJ members personally , and I am fully convinced of their belief . "" Wilmore counts himself among the JJ believers . "" My own convictions are a result of philosophical introspection and a considerable body of NNS that I have personally observed , and which I am still compiling , ” he VBD . Strangely , Wilmore and the society 's NN , a 35 - NN - old Virginia - born Londoner named Daniel Shenton , both VBP the NN for JJ NN is strong , despite much of this NN coming from satellite NNS gathered by NNP , the kingpin of the "" round NNP NN . "" They RB accept evolution and most other mainstream tenets of NN . As inconceivable as their belief NN seems , it does n't RB surprise experts . Karen Douglas , a psychologist at the NNP of Kent in the NNP Kingdom who studies the psychology of NN NNS , VBZ JJ - earthers ' beliefs cohere with those of other NN theorists she has studied . "" It seems to me that these NNS do generally VB that the NNP is JJ . I 'm not seeing anything that sounds as if they 're just putting that idea out there for any other reason , "" Douglas VBD Live NNP . She VBD all NN NNS share a basic thrust : They present an alternative NN about an important issue or event , and construct an ( often ) vague explanation for why someone is covering up that "" JJ "" version of events . "" CD of the major points of appeal is that they explain a JJ event but often without VBG into details , "" she VBD . "" A lot of the NN lies in the fact that they are vague . "" The self - assured NN in which NN theorists stick to their story imbues that story with special appeal . After all , JJ - earthers are more adamant that the NNP is JJ than most NNS are that the NNP is round ( probably because the rest of us feel we have nothing to prove ) . "" If you 're faced with a minority viewpoint that is put forth in an intelligent , seemingly well - informed NN , and when the proponents do n't deviate from these strong opinions they have , they can be very influential . We call that minority influence , "" Douglas VBD . In a NN published RB March 5 , 2014 , in the NNP Journal of NNP NNP , Eric Oliver and Tom Wood , JJ NNS at the NNP of Chicago , VBD that about half of Americans endorse at least CD NN NN , from the notion that 9/11 was an inside job to the JFK NN . "" JJ NNS are willing to VB JJ ideas that are directly in contradiction to a dominant cultural narrative , "" Oliver VBD Live NNP . He VBZ conspiratorial belief stems from a JJ tendency to perceive unseen forces at work , VBN as magical thinking . [ Top CD Unexplained Phenomena ] However , JJ - earthers do n't fit entirely snugly in this general picture . Most NN theorists adopt JJ fringe NNS , RB ones that contradict each other . Meanwhile , JJ - earthers ' only hang - up is the shape of the NNP . "" If they were IN other NN theorists , they should be exhibiting a tendency toward a lot of magical thinking , such as believing in UFOs , ESP , ghosts , the Devil , or other unseen , intentional forces , "" Oliver wrote in an email . "" It does n't sound IN they do , which makes them very anomalous relative to most Americans who VBP in NN NNS .

Conspiracy_NN theories_NNS are_VBP not_RB uniform_JJ –_: nor_CC should_MD our_PRP$ engagements_NNS with_IN them_PRP be_VB ._.","Ever since the NN spread across the NN , suspicions have proliferated about what is RB VBG on . Questions arose about the origins of the NN , the NN it makes NNS sick , the mitigation measures taken , the suspended civil rights , the connection with 5G , possible cures and medications , and about the role of NNP NNP in it all . These ideas are commonly framed as NN NNS . Yes , they MD all distrust the mainstream narrative and share certain characteristics , but they are not CD of a kind . They take so JJ JJ forms and have such varying degrees of plausibility that I question how useful it is to bracket them all under the same banner . To understand and effectively respond to the various NN NN NNS , we VBP to dig deeper . Listen to our Expert guide to NN NNS , a series by The Conversation ’s The Anthill podcast . The dominant explanation for the popularity of NN NN NNS is remarkably similar : these dark and unsettling ideas VBP NNS make sense of a complex and uncertain NN . They provide sufficiently JJ explanations for tragic events , and give back feelings of agency and NN . Since these ideas sometimes have real - NN consequences , from 5G masts set on fire to ignoring NN mitigation measures , various commentators condemn these NN NNS . Officials now VBP not only fight a NN NN , so their story goes , but an infodemic too . The problem with the generalising approach is threefold . It does not account for the motivations of NN theorists themselves ; nor for the JJ forms and plausibility of the various NN NNS ; nor for their relations with various JJ and societal issues . Providing uniform explanations for NN NNS fails to seriously consider their contents or underlying concerns . Similarly , it leaves untouched how certain NN NNS are weaponised in various propaganda wars . A closer look at these NNS or – RB better – actual engagement with the NNS propagating them , shows NN NNS not so much as a uniform coping strategy in unsettling times , but rather as a wide array of cultural expressions . These include suspicions of planned efforts to impose mass vaccinations , doubts about the origins of the NN , expressions of disgust for the ruling elite , geopolitical insinuations , pointers to an inflated NN panic , the scapegoating of certain societal groups ( Chinese or Jews ) , critiques on the methods and measurements of NN - CD NNS and deaths , discontents with powerful philanthropists , worries about the expansion of authoritarian NN policies , or concerns about corporate intrusion in the search for effective medications . This means , as I argue in my recent book , that we VBP to focus on the meaning , diversity and context of JJ NN NNS , as well as the NNS who subscribe to them . During my ethnographic research projects on contemporary NN cultures , I encountered a wide variety of NNS , ideas , practices and communities . Because NN NN NNS have yet to settle down , let ’s turn to some markedly JJ NN NN subcultures that have been RB for longer . They illustrate how JJ NN NNS and the NNS who subscribe to them can be . Starting with the anti-vaccination movement – of great concern to JJ . Because JJ anti-vaxxers in the western NN are highly educated urban hipsters , it is difficult to reject them as ignorant deplorables . Read more : Throwing NN at anti-vaxxers just makes them more hardline Next to critiques of NNP Pharma , NN hesitancy is informed by holistic and naturalistic ideas about NN and the body ; ideas rooted in alternative medicine and NNP Age spiritualities . In these subcultural worlds , emotions , feelings , experiences , testimonies and JJ relations are often more important guides than scientific NN . Rather JJ are those active in the 9/11 Truth Movement . Broadly interested in geopolitics and NN cover ups , these NNS challenge the mainstream narrative of 9/11 with competing factual and scientific NN . They advance visual proofs and mathematical calculations of why the towers MD not have collapsed by the planes , but indicate controlled demolition instead . These activists profess NN of physics , construction and explosives , and ground their legitimacy in this expertise . They are focused on “ exposing the official lies ” . IN JJ activists , they wish revolutionary NN , “ to end the regime and illicit NN structures responsible for 9/11 ” . The list of markedly JJ NN subcultures MD VB on . VB of the NNP Earthers , who deploy various scientific methodologies and perform actual experiments in the outside NN to show that it is not a globe but a Truman Show - JJ dome . Read more : I watched an entire NNP NNP Convention for my research – here 's what I learnt Favouring rational thinking and scientific methods is , however , no guarantee for brotherhood . 9/11 Truthers generally stay away from them as that MD harm their credibility .

He was named for a Shawnee chief . William Tecumseh Sherman ( VBN as “ Cump ” to his friends ) was born in Lancaster , Ohio , on February 8 , 1820 . His father gave him his unusual middle name as a nod to the Shawnee chief Tecumseh , a magnetic leader who built a confederacy of Ohio Indian tribes and fought with the British during the NNP of 1812 . A relative later wrote that Sherman ’s father always shook off concerns that he had given his son a “ savage Indian name ” by arguing , “ Tecumseh was a great warrior . ” After losing his father at the age of 9 , Sherman was sent to live with Thomas Ewing , a renowned Ohio attorney and family friend who later served as a senator and the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury . The young Sherman grew close with Ewing ’s eldest daughter , Ellen , and they regularly corresponded through letters during his tenure at West Point and his early JJ career . Following a JJ engagement , the CD were married in 1850 in a NNP , D.C. , ceremony attended by the likes of NNP Zachary Taylor , Henry Clay and Daniel Webster . The couple later had eight NNS , CD of whom died from sickness while Sherman was serving in the Civil NNP . 3 . He played a role in triggering the California Gold Rush . While stationed in San Francisco in 1848 , Sherman helped convince JJ governor Richard Mason to investigate CD of the JJ reported gold discoveries in California . He was on the scene during a mission that confirmed the existence of rich gold deposits along the Sacramento River , and later penned the letter Mason sent to NNP relaying their findings . Coupled with other early discoveries , Sherman and Mason ’s fact - finding mission inadvertently set off a wave of gold fever in the NNP NNPS . In less than a NN , California ’s population more than quadrupled after thousands of speculators journeyed west to make their fortune . 4 . He had a rocky career in business . After missing out on combat in the Mexican NNP NNP and enduring a series of lackluster assignments , Sherman left the NN in 1853 to run a San Francisco bank . While he proved a competent businessman , the move corresponded with the bursting of the Gold Rush bubble , and his branch collapsed in the ensuing financial hysteria . Sherman was left humiliated , in part because JJ JJ friends — including future Civil NNP generals Braxton Bragg and George Thomas — had entrusted NN to him . To VB cover their losses , he eventually liquidated some $ 20,000 worth of his own assets . A despondent Sherman left the banking NN for good in 1858 . He later signed on as the JJ superintendent of the Louisiana NNP Seminary of Learning and NNP Academy — the school that MD become Louisiana NNP NNP . 5 . He MD have suffered a nervous breakdown during the Civil NNP . Following a promising performance at July 1861 ’s NNP Battle of Bull Run , Sherman was promoted to brigadier general and eventually given command of Union troops in Kentucky and Tennessee . Sherman had n’t wanted the role , and in short order , the weight of its responsibilities took a toll on his mental NN . He vastly overestimated the size of Confederate forces in the region , griped in his dispatches to NNP Lincoln and appeared constantly on edge . Historians have since speculated that he was suffering from depression or nervous exhaustion , but whatever its NN , the general ’s bizarre behavior eventually VBD its NN into the papers , some of which labeled him insane . Sherman requested to be relieved from his position in early November 1861 , and remained sidelined until that December , when he was reassigned to the Western Theater . He was later placed under the command of General Ulysses S. Grant , and following a crucial victory at April 1862 ’s Battle of Shiloh , the pair forged a winning partnership that lasted for the remainder of the NN . 6 . He cut off all lines of communication during the march to the NN . Sherman ’s March to the NNP was CD of the most stunning operations of the Civil NNP , yet few NNS outside of Georgia knew anything about it while it was underway . Before leaving Atlanta , Sherman intentionally severed all telegraph links to the North to VB shroud his moves in secrecy . The plan meant the Confederates MD only speculate about where Sherman and his 60,000 - strong rampaging army were headed , but it RB left the Union high command in the dark about the mission ’s progress . When asked about Sherman ’s whereabouts , a worried NNP Lincoln is VBN to have responded , “ We VBP what hole he went in , but we do n’t VB what hole he will come out of . ” Sherman MD finally reappear on December 22 , having slashed and burned his NN through the heart of Georgia . Upon reaching the NN , he sent a famous message to Lincoln that read : “ I beg to present you as a Christmas gift the city of Savannah . ” 7 . He offered lenient terms of surrender to defeated Confederates . Despite his reputation for “ hard ” warfare , Sherman MD RB be surprisingly — perhaps RB naively — generous in victory . When he accepted Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston ’s surrender in Durham , North Carolina , in April 1865 , Sherman offered very forgiving terms that granted general amnesty to the rebels and RB allowed for the Southern NNS to immediately re-enter the Union upon swearing an oath of allegiance . The sweeping agreement enraged U.S. Secretary of NNP Edwin Stanton , who rejected it out of hand and criticized Sherman for giving up “ all the advantages we had gained from the NN . ” Joseph Johnston was forced to surrender under more conventional terms , but he went on to become a good friend to Sherman , and RB served as a pallbearer at his old adversary ’s funeral in 1891 . 8 . He RB VBD his “ scorched NN ” brand of warfare against Native Americans . After the Civil NNP , Sherman was given command of the NNP Division of the Mississippi and tasked with pacifying the Plains Indians during the building of the transcontinental railroad . Sherman took to the job with characteristic vigor , orchestrating the relocation of the tribes and warning their chiefs , “ you cannot stop the locomotive any more than you can stop the NN or the NN , and you must submit . ” To VB break the natives ’ spirit , Sherman took a page from his Civil NNP playbook and set his sights on destroying CD of their primary resources : the buffalo . Beginning in the late 1860s , he organized the killing of some 5 CD bison in an effort to drive the creatures to the brink of extinction . Sherman continued his harsh policies after becoming commanding general of the army in 1869 , and by the 1870s , he had helped force most of the Plains peoples onto reservations . 9 . He repeatedly declined to run for NN . Sherman made no secret of his disdain for politics , once quipping that he MD rather spend four NNS in jail than in the White NNP . Nevertheless , during the 1870s and 1880s , NNP D.C. , movers and shakers often tried — and failed — to convince him to make a run at the presidency . Sherman tried to stamp out the speculation once and for all in 1884 , when he turned down an invitation to become the Republican candidate by saying , “ I will not accept if nominated and will not serve if elected . ” His unequivocal response has since become famous in JJ circles , where similar JJ refusals are often dubbed “ Shermanesque statements . ”"

Melges — who himself , in 1985 , took into his care the homeless woman Lois Lang who assassinated NNP paymaster Nick Deak — and that afterwards saw the NNP ’s black operations monies being controlled by Ralph G. Blasey Jr. — who , not so mysteriously , just happens to be the father of Dr. Christine Blasey . [ Note : Some words and / or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words / phrases having no exact counterpart . ] According to this report , with NNP being warned , just prior to his assuming the presidency , by the powerful Democratic Party US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that US intelligence services “ have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you ” , this past nearly CD NNS has shown just how prescient this warning was — and whose latest “ strike back ” against NNP is coming courtesy of a rogue NNP faction who have just trotted out for JJ display Dr. Christine Blasey ( married name Christine Blasey Ford ) — who claims that as a young high school teenager Brett Kavanaugh , RB a high school teenager , tried to sexually assault her — but whose “ NN ” for this being JJ shows Dr. Blasey unable to name the exact NN it happened , her not remembering where the incident took place or how she got home , her not being able to remember key details of the incident , her not remembering how the gathering came together the night of the incident , and her not telling anyone else about at the NN — but should be expected to be the NN from an unproven salacious allegation of this sort as it comes from a woman supporting the Democratic Party and who , RB , hates NNP NNP . As the “ ” aligned mainstream propaganda NN began flooding the airwaves , newspapers and internet with Dr. Blasey ’s claims against Judge Kavanaugh , that have absolutely no proof or NN behind anyone MD ever investigate , this report continues , SVR intelligence analysts were immediately able to bring up her file in the archive of VBN and / or suspected NNP operatives — and whose placement in this file was due to her extensive and advanced educational training at Stanford NNP in the NNP - funded NN NN - brainwashing techniques developed by Stanford NNP Psychiatric Professor Dr. Frederick T. Melges — whose primary mission for the NNP was to develop JJ technologies for interrogation and torture , secondary applications VBG towards studying the possibilities of exploiting highly “ suggestible ” subjects and getting them to do things — murders , couriers — they MD n’t otherwise do , and of which they MD have no memory in NN they were caught . Linked to Dr. Blasey ’s SVR file of VBN and / or suspected NNP operatives , this report notes , is that of her father Ralph G. Blasey Jr. — a proven NNP operative who , from June - 1962 to January - 1974 , was the Vice NNP of National Savings and Trust of NNP , D.C. — a NNP black budget bank best VBN for being 100 paces from the White NNP , and whom , in 1998 , was taken over by SunTrust Bank — whose majority share owner is the NNP - linked investment fund BlackRock . The importance of noting the NNP banking connections of Ralph G. Blasey Jr. , this report explains , is due to the outbreak of what is now VBN as the “ NNP Bank NNP ” — and whose start of , in 1982 , a NNP seized from publication NN report ( Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/05 : NNP - RDP90-00965R00150010 - 7 ) describes as : “ This is Wall Street , the center of the international banking NN , a NN on the edge of a NN so severe that the Central Intelligence Agency is preparing drastic measures . Something must be done to avert the breakdown of the Free NNP 's monetary NN . ” The main NNP operative involved in this NN , and whom Ralph G. Blasey Jr. reported to , this report details , was Nicholas Deak — a longtime OSS and NNP operative , both during and after NNP NNP II , who ran the NNP ’s main black budget operations under the direct command of the feared NNP Counterintelligence Chief James Jesus Angleton . To how the NNP prevented the total breakdown of the Western banking NN in 1982 , this report VBZ , was by their illegally laundering hundreds - of - millions of dollars of Colombian drug cartel cash into it to keep it afloat in an operation overseen by the NNP ’s “ James Bond of NNP ” Nickolas Deak — but when the NNP Ronald Reagan administration VBD out what the NNP had done , and started investigating it , saw Deak , on CD November 1985 , being assassinated in his NNP NNP City office by a homeless woman named Lois Lang — who had mysteriously managed to travel thousands - of - NNS across the NNP NNPS from Seattle to conduct this killing in what NN reports at the NN described as : Lang saw him and turned the corner with purpose , aiming the pistol with both arms . When she had Deak in her sights , she froze , transfixed . “ It was as if she ’d finally VBN what she was looking for , ” a witness later testified . Deak seized the pause to lunge and grab Lang ’s throat with both hands , pressing his body into hers . She fired once next to Deak ’s ear and missed wide , before pushing him away just enough to bring the gun into his body and land a shot above his heart . The bullet ricocheted off his collarbone and shredded his organs . Deak crumbled onto the floor . “ Now you ’ve got yours , ” VBD Lang . A witness later claimed she took out a camera and snapped photographs of her victim ’s expiring body . The bag lady then grabbed the banker by the legs , dragged him into his office , and shut the door . Though the JJ NNS were correctly VBN that Nicolas Deak assassin Lois Lang had previously been under psychiatric care , this report continues , what was failed to be reported to them was that Lang had been under the direct care and JJ supervision of the NNP ’s own Stanford NNP Psychiatric Professor Dr. Frederick T. Melges just prior to her traveling from Seattle to NNP NNP City to carry out this assassination — and who was the exact type of assassin Dr. Melges had been working to create in his NNP - funded NN NN MKULTRA programme — and whose Canadian victims of are still being silenced after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , this past December , imposed a gag order on them to keep them silent — but that does apply to Judge Kavanaugh accuser Dr. Christine Blasey , who remains able to teach her NNP Undergraduate Internship Program at Stanford NNP the MKULTRA NN NN techniques discovered by Dr. Melges . IN his daughter Dr. Christine Blasey , this report concludes , NNP black NN operative Ralph G. Blasey Jr. remains secure , too — and who , today , is the Vice NN of Business Development of Red Coats , Inc. — whose Admiral Security Services provides armed security for “ Deep NNP ” elites in NNP D.C. — that is overseen by Red Coats , Inc. co-founder and Vice Chairman William F. Peel III — and whose Datawatch Systems , Peel III RB controls , has US NN contracts extending till 23 June 2023 under the category of 246.42.1 to provide US defense and intelligence agencies with facility management systems to include accessories and repair parts , computerized systems for surveillance , monitoring , controlling , signaling and reporting multiple functions — all of which SVR intelligence analysts VBP the JJ NNS have the NN to VB about in their evaluating the claims against Judge Kavanaugh being leveled against him by Dr. Christine Beasley — but who VBP it will never happen .

Regardless_RB ,_, there_EX is_VBZ little_JJ harm_NN ._.","Grounding , RB called earthing , is a therapeutic technique that involves doing activities that “ ground ” or electrically reconnect you to the NN . This practice relies on earthing NN and grounding physics to explain how from the NN can have positive effects on your body . This type of grounding therapy is n’t entirely the same as the technique that is VBN in mental NN treatment . In this article , we ’ll explore the NN behind grounding NN , the risks and benefits of VBG earthing techniques , and how to perform grounding . What the NN VBZ Grounding is currently an under - researched topic and there are very few scientific studies on the benefits . However , the most recent scientific research has explored grounding for inflammation , cardiovascular NN , muscle damage , chronic NN , and mood . The central NN from CD is that grounding affects the living matrix , which is the central connector between living cells . Electrical conductivity exists within the matrix that functions as an JJ NN defense , similar to antioxidants . They VBP that through grounding , the natural defenses of the body can be restored . Further research expands on this idea . In a on grounding and heart NN , CD healthy participants were grounded VBG patches on the palms of their hands and soles of their NNS . NN measurements were taken before and after grounding to determine any NNS in red NN cell fluidity , which plays a role in heart NN . The results indicated significantly less red NN cell clumping after grounding , which suggests benefits for cardiovascular NN . Another slightly examined the role of grounding on post - exercise muscle damage . Researchers VBD both grounding patches and mats and measured creatine kinase , white NN cell count , and NN levels before and after grounding . NN work indicated that grounding reduced muscle damage and NN in participants . This suggests that grounding MD influence healing abilities . This research is supported by a recent on grounding for NN reduction and mood improvement . Sixteen massage therapists alternated between periods of grounding and no grounding . Before grounding therapy , physical and emotional stress and NN were common side effects of their physically demanding jobs . After the earthing therapy , NN , stress , depression , and fatigue were all reduced among participants . Most of the studies on grounding are JJ and rely somewhat on subjective measures , such as self - reported feelings , mood , or RB self - administered treatment . Some studies RB rely on NN markers , such as those that detect inflammation , but the size and shortage of these studies suggests that more research is needed . There are JJ types of grounding . All of them focus on reconnecting yourself to the NN . This can be done through either direct or indirect contact with the NN . Have you ever been outside on a warm summer day and felt the urge to run barefoot in the grass ? CD of the easiest ways to ground yourself to the NN is to walk barefoot . Whether this is on grass , sand , or RB mud , allowing your NN to touch the natural ground can provide you with grounding NN . You can increase your NN - to - NN contact by lying on the ground . You can do it in the grass by the park or on the sand at the beach . If you ’re VBG to ground yourself in this NN , be sure to take the proper precautions and never lie somewhere you MD be injured . According to advocates for grounding , NN MD be VBN to ground in the same NN the physical NN is VBN for grounding . They suggest simply wading in a clear lake or swimming in the ocean as a NN to ground yourself . As always , be sure to stay safe when swimming , especially in murky or deep waters . When VBG outside to ground yourself is n’t an option , there are . CD method of earthing involves connecting a metal rod to the ground outside and then connecting the rod to your body through a wire . If you ’re not comfortable VBG a metal rod to ground yourself , there ’s other grounding equipment available . This equipment is an effective NN to incorporate earthing therapy into your daily NN and includes : You can find grounding mats , sheets , blankets , socks , and bands RB . There ’s not much research on the benefits of grounding . However , NNS have reported improvement for conditions such as : • Chronic fatigue . In the on massage therapists , JJ reported a decrease in their fatigue levels after four weeks of treatment with grounding mats . • Chronic NN . The on grounding for exercise recovery VBD that those who VBD grounding patches reported lower NN levels . • Anxiety and depression . In CD JJ , it was shown that RB 1 hour of grounding therapy can significantly improve mood . • Sleep disorders . The massage therapists RB experienced an improvement in sleep length and reduce sleep disturbances with grounding therapy . • Cardiovascular NN . Results of CD treatment VBD that JJ - term self - administered grounding therapy helped to reduce NN pressure levels in participants with hypertension . As mentioned above , JJ of these studies are JJ and require further research . Still , some NN professionals VBP that the benefits of grounding therapy MD come simply from feeling IN you ’re reconnected to nature . Regardless , there is little harm ."

NN is about killing JJ beings . You VBP , I am a killer . I have participated in killing other JJ beings . The Vietnamese soldiers were trying to kill us . We were all young and brainwashed , and were n't smart enough ( yet ) to VB what we were being asked to do . I was on a firebase next to Highway NNP , a main thoroughfare in south Vietnam that ran through a portion of the country VBN as the Elephant 's Ear . It was called the Elephant 's Ear because of the shape of the border 's protrusion into Cambodia . Ours was an artillery station that carried a battery ( 6 ) of 105 mm howitzers and a battery of 155 mm howitzers . These are very JJ guns . We were RB camp to others : mortar squads , infantry units and sundry support services . This was in 1968 , the NN of the "" Tet Offensive "" , the great push by the North Vietnamese Army and the Viet Cong ( civilian anti-American guerrilla forces ) to rid the country of the "" foreign invaders "" ( us ) . It was CD peaceful Sunday evening in March , a cooler day in the hottest part of the NN . Everyone was VBG on their usual routines of duty and maintenence when the shit hit the fan . Mortars began to whistle in . The cry , "" Incoming , incoming "" went over the landing zone 's p.a. NN . Everyone went to the trenches , or VBD whatever cover they MD . I was caught out in the open . My only alternative was lay JJ on the hard NN , not far from the trench dug for our unit . Shells rained down all RB . Explosions went off everywhere , and my unit remained in the trench . I screamed "" We better VB up here and do something , "" to the guys in the trench . I thought they were cowering . They were not cowering . They had not received orders yet , and PRP does nothing in the NN without orders . Nearby , CD or CD of the fire pits , where excess round charges were kept , went up in pillars of fire . Gaining some self NN , I went to the NN supply and poured NN on the fire pits that were close to my unit to prevent them from VBG up in flames . The other members of my unit were still in the foxhole awaiting orders . The orders came . "" Battery , adjust . Shell H.E. , lot six , fuse NN , deflection 1540 , azimuth 320 . "" This VBD the unit how to adjust the aim of the huge guns . We all went about our tasks of preparing the JJ guns efficiently , heedless in this hour of necessity of the death whistling nearby , blind to everything but our task . Our hope only was group survival . This violence and shelling and death went on all night . As various units ran out of ordinance , we went through open areas to deliver fifty pound rounds on our shoulders . We were aware of , but not reacting to , the threat of instant death or injury all IN us . After a number of hours ( who can VB how JJ or how few ) exhaustion set in , and me and a buddy crawled into a culvert to sleep , the battle still raging all RB , but we were too exhausted to care . When I awoke , all was quiet , but the aftermath of the battle was there . There was devastation all RB . I VBD that the perimeter had been broached a number of times but superior firepower had stopped the NNS trying to break in , leaving their bodies to pile up inbetween the outer ring of wire and the inner . There were bodies all RB , or parts of bodies , or bodies blown in half , or bodies with heads split open looking for all the NN IN some kind of watermelon , with their bright red insides . Hundreds of parts or half or whole bodies . Numbers impossible to estimate accurately , due to the dismembered NN of the dead . There were probably hundreds . I stopped and gazed down at the corpse of a young boy , a dead N.V.A. soldier , and I saw someone very much IN myself . Unlike others nearby , he was whole . No apparant NN of death visible . I stared into his face , wondering about him . What kind of person was he ? Who was the family he had left behind ? Now I VBP that his family MD be left wondering forever whatever happened to him , because they MD never have his remains . They , after NNS of hope and greif , MD have to either assume him dead , or maybe lost , him only a memory . I still VBP his face these JJ NNS later , a brother unto me , me alive , him dead . He was as if sleeping , still free from obvious corruption if not for the pallor of his NN or the flies moving in and out of his nose . Shortly after dawn , we were called to order . Some names did not answer to roll call . No explanations at that NN were forthcoming . Tasks were given out . "" Who wants body detail ? "" VBD the sargeant . Only CD or CD volunteered . "" Ok , you , you , you , you and you , VB out there and clean up . "" The men were divided into teams , given wheelbarrows , and were sent out to bring the bodies and parts to a specific place . That went on all morning . It took a few days for the bulldozer to be shipped in by flying crane , and when it arrived , a giant pit was dug and all the JJ remains that were collectable were buried there . Our dead , about seven , were shipped home to the NNS . JJ of the enemy dead were not able to be collected . They were in enemy territory , and were left to the enemy . JJ had been wounded and crawled to hidden areas in the surrounding jungle where they died later . Some were near unexploded ordinance and were extremely dangerous . The end result was the stench of death . NNP , what a stench . It was all - pervading . Another result was a plague of flies . You had to eat anyway , knowing that the flies that were living on the JJ carnage were the same ones that were landing on your sandwich . There were clouds of white termite - IN flies that presumably fed on the dead , and these were called "" body bugs "" and were avoided as much as possible . The white flies were probably taking the blame for the other , more ordinary flies , who were more easily tolerated but who were in actuality RB feeding off the same "" table . "" With NN and burial , the plague of flies and the stench lessened . As the weeks went by , the battle was just another psychological scar torn through the distance of self , to be buried in the press of duty , to emerge NNS later , leaving you weeping unexpectedly at jovial occasions , much to the puzzlement of your family or friends . Some of the enemy had gotten through the perimeter , and had in a suicidal paroxysm , tried to do as much damage as possible before being killed . CD private , recently promoted to "" temporary corporal "" in lieu of his later promised advancement , ( we called them "" candy stripers "" as they wore a black band with their future rank on it ) was able to put an end to CD of these invaders . He had shot him through the back , the automatic weapons fire ( m16 ) moving through his body in a pattern , making a series of holes through from the back to the front of the body IN buttons on a jacket . This individual took polaroid photos of his "" trophy "" and gave them to me for safe keeping . Why he had selected me for this task was n't clear , but I was the wrong person to give them to . I buried them , repelled by the concept of JJ dead as trophy material . I got into a JJ fight when he tried to VB his photos and I VBD that I had "" lost "" them . Lots of others were not so squeamish , however . Some kept photos , or articles of clothing , weapons , medals or body parts , mostly ears , dried in the NN to a leather IN texture , from the ones they killed . I remember Sgt. Hirshberg telling me that he had to boil a belt that he got from a N.V.A. soldier 's corpse for CD days to VB the stink of death out of it . Soon after , Sgt. Hirshberg himself was VBN dead . Perhaps an N.V.A. soldier boiled his belt . That kind of thing that was as common as bread , then . Death . JJ beings lowered to the basest impulses within themselves , killed other JJ beings for the thrill of it , easily and without thought as easily as you MD fish in your pocket for NN to take the bus . Killing is legal , there . You MD VB to prison here , or perhaps VB the death penalty for the killing and and the mutiliation . In Vietnam it was sport . No morality . No ethics about who shall die and live . Nope . Death was sport . Or revenge . Often , the enemy MD horribly mutilate our dead , to instill terror or just to VB "" fuck you "" in the worst NN possible . We MD retaliate in kind . I remember a group of infantry men telling how they cut off the penises of their enemy and shoved them in the mouths of the newly dead as a kind of "" fuck you back "" gesture . Death then becomes a kind of communication , a grisly "" postcard "" if you will . Forget about JJ and wrong . It does n't exist . Only survival , hatred , revenge and killing . In the crucible of NN , it all boils down to the lowest denominators . There is little mercy . When we JJ beings are placed in a kill or be killed situation , we can only become killers . We VBP our friends die and revenge is our only outlet . You make the most of the situation by becoming the most beautiful artistic killer possible . JJ and wrong ? A just NN ? The NN was engaged in a psychological NN as well , entreating by helicopter equipped with speakers for the enemy to "" give up , give up . You will be treated fairly and those of you who are innocent will be sent back to your families "" . They flew over the countryside calling out in the Vietnamese language , "" Chiu hoi , chiu hoi ... "" They RB dropped leaflets with the same message by the thousands over the land . I saw firsthand the benefits of this "" mercy program . "" I was watching as an N.V.A. soldier was cornered in the nearby countryside and had decided to give in to the cries of "" chiu hoi "" that our soldiers were making . He put his weapons on the ground . He stood up with his hands behind his head . A burst of gunfire and a "" Take that , motherfucker "" and it was over . It was n't a puzzle to me why the program met with little success . I have n't RB gotten to the non combatants yet . Men , women and NNS , innocents all , falling to the stray bullet , being blown apart by the hidden mine , town destroyed by the misplaced bomb , or worse . It seems that we have forgotten about Lt. William Calley and the village of Mi Lai . William Calley was NN martialed and VBN guilty of the massacre of a number of innocent men women and NNS . He rounded up the inhabitants of this JJ hamlet , collected them together as possible enemy collaborators and ordered them all to be killed , burning the village after . The men who refused to fire upon the NNS who played a major part in his conviction . William Calley was an offering to the millions who were protesting the NN here at home . JJ others followed his methods and were not punished for their crimes . They suffer only the nightmares that doubtless still haunt them . It is estimated by some that CD to three CD non-combatants , civilians , died as a direct or indirect result of the Viet Nam conflict . I must VB that there are other ways . I must VB that we can find other means . To VB otherwise MD be anathematic to my very NN , and I MD either retreat into irreversible insanity or suicide , as so JJ of my fellows have done . Is it any wonder that the NN veteran has the highest rate of "" non-functionality "" : drug addiction , alcholism and suicide , of any other group ? Do you VB that NN veterans comprise the largest part of the homeless ? I VBP why they "" drop out "" . For NNS , I was unemployed , NN , RB into drugs . I VBD it impossible to work a job that paid taxes to the Death Machine . By the grace of NNP I escaped the fate of so JJ , to be reduced to a voiceless suffering shell of what I MD be . I came back alive from this cauldron of death to tell you that there must be another NN . So JJ others did not come back , will not come back , and I speak for them . Let us pray for peace ."

The massive 12 - nation free trade agreement has been negotiated in secret now for almost four NNS , and the NN release by WikiLeaks shows that key JJ safeguards in the agreement are being stripped away , including a ban on shark fining and illegal logging , as well as legally - enforced pollution regulations . “ If the environment chapter is finalized as written in this leaked document , NNP Obama ’s JJ trade record MD be worse than George W. Bush ’s , ” Michael Brune , executive director of the Sierra Club , VBD bluntly . “ This draft chapter falls JJ on every single CD of our issues — oceans , fish , wildlife , and forest protections — and in fact , rolls back on the progress made in past free trade pacts . ” The TPP has been CD of the Obama Administration ’s top priorities for the Pacific region , but green groups VBP that it looks IN the administration has given significant ground on crucial JJ issues in a desire to VB the deal signed , which has already run past its goal of finalization by 2013 . JJ past free trade agreements have wholly lacked any legally - binding JJ safeguards , but in 2007 then U.S. NNP George W. Bush struck an agreement with democrats to include JJ safeguards in all future free trade agreements . However , environmentalists are now concerned that this requirement will bring about little JJ gains in the TPP . For example , the draft text completely lacks any enforcement . An analysis by Jane Kelsey with the NNP of Aukland finds that the draft text “ falls far below the standards ” set by the U.S. Congress in 2007 . “ Negotiators are allowing a unique opportunity to protect wildlife and support legal sustainable trade of renewable resources to slip through their fingers . these nations account for more than a quarter of JJ trade in fish and wood NNS and they have a responsibility to address trade ’s impact on wildlife crime , illegal logging , and overfishing , ” VBD Carter Roberts , NNP of NNP Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) , who called the NN leak a “ peek behind the curtain . ” According to the release by WikiLeaks , the TPP as it stands does not RB require member nations to uphold commitments to JJ JJ agreements , such the Convention on International Trade in Endangered NNP ( CITES ) . Criticism of the TPP goes well - beyond JJ issues , however . JJ groups have complained of the investor - NN settlement agreement in the plan that allows corporations to sue NNS when contracts are breached . Critics of this model VBP it benefits foreign investors as they expense of JJ rights , working conditions , and the environment . Negotiations have RB been blasted for being held completely behind closed doors , with some U.S. Senators complaining that multinational corporations are privy to the negotiations while the U.S. Congress is left in the dark .

There appear to be rocklike structures and flowing liquid on Titan - RB , they VBP , a form of liquid methane rainfall . NN - JJ characteristics described Friday by NNS at the European NNP Institute in Paris . Just a week ago , NNS were applauding the successful landing of the NN probe , which plunged through the murky , chilling air of Titan to land on a spongy NN they described as wet sand or soft clay . It appears a mysterious , pinkish orangey NN . Pictures sent by the probe showed a JJ terrain with fist - sized objects that researchers described as chunks of NN . Now , NNS have been able to sift through dozens of images sent by the Huygens NN probe over the NN of several hours before its batteries went dead . Martin Tomasko , CD of the principal investigators for the Titan project , describes some of the grainy , black and white images to reporters . "" This is a field of view CD kilometer across and you VBP this very rugged terrain , "" he VBZ . "" We VBP a ridge NN . "" The pictures show spidery dark lines etched on Titan 's NN . There are RB lighter areas . They appear a mystery to ordinary viewers . But the projects NNS VBP they are rivers , streams and channels of liquid . Only the liquid is n't NN , which MD be frozen solid at on Titan , where it 's RB 170 degrees below zero . Instead , the NN is that it 's liquid methane . NNS RB VBP it rains regularly on this far - off NN , located a four CD kilometer journey through the Solar NNP from NN . Only it 's methane rain . And that 's not all . There appears to be stuff IN dirt on Titan , and JJ chunks that are similar to rocks . NNS VBP the sandy substance is in fact shards of crushed NN on Titan . The rocklike substances are larger chunks of NN . Titan seems vastly JJ from our home NN , but European NNP Agency mission manager Jean - Pierre Lebreton VBZ he is struck by the similarities . "" Our JJ picture of Titan is RB fascinating . And what we are seeing is NN - JJ processes on Titan . But the JJ difference is the ingredients are somewhat JJ . The liquid on Titan is methane , the liquid on NN is NN . The rocks on NN are silicate . The rocks on Titan are NN blocks . And the dirt on NN is our dirt . The dirt on Titan is organic matter , "" he VBZ . Only a week after receiving date from the Huygens probe , the NNS ' findings are still preliminary . They VBP it will take weeks and months to sift through the rich trove of NNS sent by the NN probe . And they VBP JJ mysteries remain . The Titan landing is a joint project by European and JJ NNS . It took the Huygens probe seven NNS to reach the NN , traveling aboard the Saturn probe Cassini . And it took Huygens more than CD hours to float down to Titan 's NN , slowed down by parachutes . The probe settled some CD - 15 centimeters into the top layers of Titans spongy NN . Scientist Martin Tomasko VBZ the probe seems to have settled in a dry corner of the NN - similar to parts of Africa or the NNP NNPS . "" The region we landed in is more typical of arid regions on the NN . We do n't VB we have open pools of liquid methane , but the methane kind of sinks down into the NN material , into the sand , if you will . It 's more IN Arizona , or a place IN that , where the river beds are dry most of the NN , "" he VBZ . Because the probe landed on only CD area of Titan , NNS have no idea whether it 's representative of the entire NN , or whether there are more humid regions elsewhere . They RB do n't VB whether Titan has seasons - IN a rainy season and a dry season . But they do VB there is regular precipitation on Titan ; it MD very well have rained liquid methane the day before the probe landed . The Titan findings mark a coup for the 15 - country European NNP Agency , which worked in collaboration with NNP 's NNP . The Europeans are RB savoring an earlier success of a Mars mission , which produced photographs , which its NNS VBP offer the most direct NN that NN in the form of NN MD exist on that NN . Other future projects include CD other missions to Mars and CD to Venus . And NNS Friday suggested it might be possible to explore Titan in the future with a moving rover . RB with its NN - JJ characteristics , it 's almost impossible to imagine existing in Saturn 's frozen , far - off NN . But there MD come a day - a very JJ NN from now - when Titan MD actually be livable for NN - VBN NN forms IN we VBP here on NNP . Scientist Toby Owen , from the Institute for Astronomy in Hawaii , explains . "" In about four CD NNS , our NN will expand and will become a red giant . And when than happens , there 's been a couple of scientific papers that have suggested that the NNS in the outer solar NN will rise , RB after NN has become impossible on NN . NNS will rise on Titan , the NN NN will melt , the NN NN will be released , and because we have the very basic building blocks for NN in the form of organic molecules , for a very brief NN , Titan MD be a very good place , "" he VBZ . for NN . But for RB now , it seems clear that NNS are far better off exploring Titan from where we are now -- our warm , oxygenated and faraway NN , NNP ."

Archaeologists have RB studied connections between ancient stone circles and forces of nature , such as the position of the stars and the courses of the NNP and NNP , but this MD be the JJ NN a powerful lightning strike MD have inspired such amazing feats of ingenuity . Researchers from the NNP of St. Andrews were studying the stone circle Tursachan Calanais on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides , when they began satellite - mapping the main stone circle site . While working on Site XI , or Airigh na Beinne Bige , which consists of a single standing stone on an exposed hillside overlooking the larger circle of standing stones , they discovered a massive star - shaped anomaly in the center which they VBP was caused by either multiple smaller lightning strikes or CD truly NN - shattering impact . “ Such clear NN for lightning strikes is extremely rare in the UK and the association with this stone circle is unlikely to be coincidental , ” VBD project leader Dr Richard Bates , of the NNP of St Andrews . “ Whether the lightning at Site XI focused on a tree or rock which is no longer there , or the monument itself attracted strikes , is uncertain . However , this remarkable NN suggests that the forces of nature MD have been intimately linked with everyday NN and beliefs of the early farming communities on the island . ” The 3D modelling was part of the Calanais Virtual Reconstruction Project , in which the team were able to virtually recreate the circle and map the transit of the NNP and NNP IN it for the JJ NN in four millennia . Nowadays , the stones are either lying JJ or have been buried under peat which slowly consumed the site over thousands of NNS .

Original_JJ article_NN on_IN Space.com_NNP ._.","Pluto 's NN hosts blades of NN that soar to the height of skyscrapers — and researchers have narrowed down exactly how the dramatic features form . According to JJ research , the blades are made mostly of methane NN , and form similarly to ( much shorter ) spikes of snow and NN on NNP . When the NNP Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto in July 2015 , researchers observed an astonishing variety of terrains across the dwarf NN . JJ and cratered areas on the dwarf NN 's NN point to its varied geological activity , composition and evolution over NN . The jagged spikes targeted in this latest NN form at the highest altitudes on Pluto 's NN , near its atmosphere , where methane is able to freeze out of the atmosphere — skipping straight from solid to gas without ever becoming liquid . When the NN is a bit warmer , parts of the methane NN sublimate away , heading straight back to gas form , according to the JJ NN . "" When we realized that bladed terrain consists of tall deposits of methane NN , we asked ourselves why it forms all of these ridges , as opposed to just being JJ blobs of NN on the ground , "" Jeffrey Moore , a NNP Horizons team member and lead researcher on the JJ work , VBD in a statement . "" It turns out that Pluto undergoes NN variation and sometimes , when Pluto is a little warmer , the methane NN begins to basically ' evaporate ' away . "" On NNP , such structures are called penitentes , and stretch just a few meters in height in high - altitude regions along the NN 's equator . Slight irregularities can turn into dramatic spikes of snow as the structures ' surfaces concentrate sunlight toward certain regions , sublimating some parts faster than others and leading to longer and spikier forms . The presence of penitentes on Pluto tell researchers more about how its NN and air NN VBP over NN , according to the statement , and the link between methane 's presence and high elevations can VB researchers map the dwarf NN 's topography in places where they have lower - resolution views .

The newly released photo shows the robotic lander , VBN as Beresheet , looking back at NNP from a distance of 23,363.5 NNS ( 37,600 kilometers ) . "" In the photo of NNP , taken during a slow spin of the spacecraft , Australia is clearly visible , "" mission team members wrote in an image description today ( March 5 ) . "" RB seen is the plaque installed on the spacecraft , with the Israeli flag and the inscriptions ' Am Yisrael Chai ' and ' JJ Country , JJ Dreams . ' "" The Hebrew phrase "" Am Yisrael chai "" translates as , "" The nation of Israel lives , "" or , "" The NNS of Israel live . "" Several more such maneuvers are on the docket in the near future . If all goes according to plan , Beresheet — which means "" in the beginning "" in Hebrew — will be captured into lunar orbit on April 4 , then drop softly onto the NN 's NN on April 11 . That landing MD be a major achievement . To date , the only entities to pull off a soft lunar touchdown are three superpower nations : the Soviet Union , the NNP NNPS and NNP . SpaceIL began as a competitor in the Google Lunar X Prize , a $ 30 CD race that asked privately funded teams to land a robot on the NN and have it perform a few basic tasks . The contest ended last NN without a winner , but SpaceIL and several other JJ teams continued shooting for the NN . The entire Beresheet mission , including launch , costs about $ 100 CD , mission team members have VBN . Beresheet 's ride through NN has n't been entirely smooth . Shortly after liftoff , team members noticed that the craft 's star trackers , which are critical to navigation , are susceptible to blinding by solar radiation . And Beresheet 's computer performed a reset unexpectedly just before the craft 's second planned engine burn . Mission team members have overcome these issues . For example , they traced the computer reset to cosmic radiation and firmed up Beresheet 's defenses with a software update . The lander was then able to execute the engine burn , which put Beresheet back on track toward the NN .

CD of the sites most affected by the devastation was the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear NN plant , which experienced a partial meltdown CD days after the quake . The incident is being called the worst nuclear accident since the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl , and it has shown few signs of slowing down . Click ahead to VB 11 other history - making nuclear disasters . By Daniel Bukszpan , Special To CNBC.com Posted 16 Mar 2011 On April 26 , 1986 , a reactor at the Chernobyl NN plant in Ukraine exploded , causing the worst nuclear accident the NN has seen . It sent a plume into the atmosphere with radioactive fallout that was 400 times greater than that released in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima . The plume drifted across much of the western Soviet Union . Parts of Eastern , Northern and Western Europe were RB affected . Fifty NNS were killed at the reactor site at the NN of the accident , but the number of NNS across Europe who VBD themselves in the path of the radioactive plume is anybody ’s guess . A report from the NNP Nuclear Association ( http://world-nuclear.org/info/chernobyl/inf07.html) claims that over CD CD NNS MD have been exposed to radiation . However , the full extent of the damage is unlikely to ever be VBN . Until March 2011 , the worst nuclear accident in the history of Japan took place at a uranium facility in Tokaimura on September 30 , 1999 . Three workers were attempting to mix nitric acid and uranium to form the fuel uranyl nitrate . However , the workers unknowingly VBD seven times the allowable limit of uranium , and the reactor MD n’t stop the solution from reaching critical mass . The three technicians were exposed to massive gamma and neutron radiation poisoning , which killed CD of them . More than 70 other workers received high doses of radiation as well . After an investigation , the International Atomic NNP Agency saidthat the accident had been caused by "" JJ error and serious breaches of safety principles . "" The worst nuclear accident in U.S. history took place on March 28 , 1979 at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania . A cooling NN failed , causing a partial meltdown , but a full meltdown was averted and there were no fatalities . However , despite the positive outcome and despite the passage of more than 30 NNS , the incident remains fresh in the minds of those who are old enough to remember it . The effect of the accident on the U.S. nuclear NN industry was major . The meltdown gave JJ Americans second thoughts about the risks of VBG nuclear NN , and the construction of JJ reactors , which had been steadily increasing since the 1960s , slowed substantially . Over 50 nuclear plant construction projects were cancelled in just four NNS , and the number of ongoing projects declined from 1980 until 1998 . CD of the worst nuclear contamination incidents in the NN took place in Goiania , Brazil . A radiotherapy institute in the city had relocated , leaving behind a teletherapy unit that still contained cesium chloride . On September 13 , 1987 , CD scavengers VBD the unit , carted it away in a wheelbarrow and sold it to a junkyard . The owner invited friends and family to VB the glowing blue material inside , inadvertently exposing them to radiation . All of them then went their separate ways and irradiated friends and family all over the city . In all , 245 NNS were exposed to radiation and four NNS died . According to Eliana Amaral of the International Atomic NNP Agency , CD good thing came out of the catastrophe . "" Before the 1987 accident … there was no awareness that sources must be controlled from ‘ cradle to grave ’ and to prevent the NN accessing them . After the accident these concepts were fostered . "" On July 4 , 1961 , the Soviet submarine K - CD was in the North Atlantic Ocean when it developed a radioactive leak . It had no coolant NN in place to stop the reactor from overheating and exploding , so with no other options , the crew entered the reactor compartment and fixed the leak , exposing themselves to levels of radiation in the process that were certain to kill them . All eight crew members who had fixed the leak died of radiation poisoning within three weeks of the incident . The rest of the crew , the submarine and the ballistic missiles that it carried RB became contaminated . When K - CD met up with the submarine that had intercepted its distress call , it was towed to base , which it contaminated . Then , as it was repaired over the course of CD NNS , the surrounding area and the repair workers RB became contaminated . Twenty of the submarine ’s original crew RB died of radiation sickness over the next few NNS . In the NNS following NNP NNP II , the NNP NNPS was the foremost nuclear NN in the NN . In an effort to catch up , the Soviet Union quickly built nuclear NN plants and cut corners in order to keep pace . The Mayak plant near the city of Kyshtym had a tank with a substandard cooling NN as a result , and when it failed , the increasing NN caused an explosion that contaminated almost 500 NNS of the surrounding area . Initially , the Soviet NN did n’t disclose what had happened , but CD week later they had little choice . 10,000 NNS were evacuated from the area when some began to show signs of radiation sickness . Although the Soviet NN refused to disclose any NN about the accident , a NN in Radiation and JJ Biophysicsestimates that at least 200 NNS died from exposure to radiation . The Soviet NN finally declassified NN about the disaster in 1990 . On October CD , 1957 , Windscale became the site of the worst nuclear accident in British history , and the worst in the NN until Three Mile Island 22 NNS later . A facility had been built there to produce plutonium , but when the US successfully designed a nuclear bomb that VBD tritium , the facility was VBN to produce it for the UK . However , this required running the reactor at a higher NN than its design MD sustain , and it eventually caught fire . Operators at RB worried that extinguishing the flames with NN MD VB a hydrogen explosion , but ultimately gave in and did so as the NN escalated . It worked , but not before a sizeable amount of radiation had been unleashed into the surrounding area . A 2007 studyestimated that the incident had led to over 200 NNS of cancer in the surrounding population . The Stationary Low - NN Reactor Number CD , or SL - 1 , was a nuclear reactor located in the desert forty NNS outside of Idaho Falls , Idaho . On January 3 , 1961 , the reactor exploded , killing three workers and causing a meltdown . The NN was a NN rod that had been withdrawn incorrectly , but RB after an investigation that took CD NNS to complete , the actions taken by the workers just prior to the accident were never discovered . Although the accident released radioactive material into the atmosphere , it was considered a JJ amount , and the reactor ’s remote location helped to minimize damage to the neighboring population . Still , the incident is notable for being the only fatal nuclear reactor accident in US history , and for inspiring a NN to the design of nuclear reactors , so that a mishap involving a single NN rod MD not do this kind of damage . On January 21 , 1968 , a US Air Force B - 52 bomber was running a “ Chrome Dome ” mission , a Cold War-era operation in which US bombers with nuclear payloads stayed in the air at all times , all with nearby targets in the Soviet Union that were to be attacked if commanded . The bomber , which was carrying four hydrogen bombs caught fire . The nearest emergency landing location was at Thule Air Base in Greenland , but there was not enough NN to reach it , so the crew abandoned the bomber . When it crashed , the nuclear payload ruptured and the area became contaminated with radiation . The March 2009 issue of NNP magazine classified the event as CD of the worst nuclear accidents of all NN . The 1968 incident caused the immediate discontinuation of “ Chrome Dome ” missions , and more stable explosives were eventually developed so that nuclear weapons MD be less likely to explode in an accident . The Bohunice nuclear NN plant was the JJ to be built in Czechoslovakia . The reactor was VBN on an experimental design that was meant to run on uranium mined in Czechoslovakia . However , the JJ - of - its - kind facility had multiple accidents , and it had to be shut down more than 30 times . CD workers had been killed in a 1976 incident , but the worst mishap occurred on February 22 , 1977 when a worker removed NN rods incorrectly during a routine fuel NN . This simple error caused a massive radioactive leak , and the ensuing accident earned a level 4 rating on the International Nuclear Event Scale of 1 to 7 . The Soviet NN covered up the accident , so no reliable estimates of casualties have been released to the NN . However , in 1979 , the NN decommissioned the plant , and it is expected to be fully dismantled in 2033 ."

For that , I applaud TrailDust ’s courage , as I VBP NOTHING should a priori be ruled beyond the realm of questioning . This post is my nugget of contribution to TrailDust ’s query . A persistent popular misconception of Hitler and the Nazis is that they were Christians . Nothing can be further from the truth . Instead , Hitler and the Nazis were animated by Nordic paganism and the occult . The John Hay Library at Brown NNP contains a special collection — 81 of Hitler ’s vast 16,000 - volume library . The whereabouts of most of Hitler ’s books is a mystery , although most scholars VBP they ’re scattered IN NNP . We do VB that 1,200 of them are in the Library of Congress in NNP , 81 in the John Hay Library . ( Brown NNP ) Hitler marked the margins of his books with vertical lines beside paragraphs or sentences he thought important . According to Timothy Ryback , in his book , Hitler ’s Private Library : The Books That Shaped His NNP , CD notable subject represented in the John Hay Library ’s Hitler collection is the occult , including a book that Hitler had marked — Ernst Schertel ’s Magic : History , NNP and Practice ( 1923 ) . Ryback points to CD marked sentence in Magic as quite chilling , given Hitler ’s history : Some consider Hitler to be demonically possessed . As an example , Jean - Michel Angebert asks in The Occult and the Third Reich : The Mystical Origins of Nazism and the Search For the Holy Grail ( pp. 191 and 22 ) : Lewis A. Sumberg , in his “ Translator ’s Preface ” to Angebert ’s volume , pointedly asks ( pp. xii and xiii ) : Italian Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo Ciano wrote in his diary : “ I am certain that RB if the Germans were given more than they ask for , they MD attack just the same , because they are possessed by the demon of destruction . ” ( Galeazzo Ciano , The Ciano Diaries , p. 582 . ) More recently , in an interview with Vatican Radio , the late Father Gabriel Amorth , Vatican ’s chief exorcist , VBD : “ I am convinced that the Nazis were all possessed . All you have to do is VB about what Hitler . . . did . Almost certainly they were possessed by the Devil . You can tell by their behaviour and their actions , from the horrors they committed and the atrocities that were committed on their orders . ” In fact , Vatican documents revealed that wartime pontiff Pope Pius XII had attempted a JJ - distance exorcism of Hitler . But the effort failed because , as Fr. Amorth explained , the possessed person must be consenting and willing and in the presence of the exorcist for the demon - banishing to succeed . Those who had VBN Hitler thought he was demonically possessed . Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels admitted he did not RB VB Hitler , although he worked with and saw the Führer almost every day . Goebbels VBD his aide - de-camp , Prince Schaumburg - Lippe , that there were times when Hitler gave him “ the chills . ” The most striking testimony is that by Hermann Rauschning , a Nazi leader who later fled to the U.S .

As recounted by Rauschning , during CD of his night terrors : “ Hitler was standing there in his bedroom , stumbling about , looking IN him with a distraught look . He was muttering : ‘ It ’s him ! It ’s him ! He ’s here !’ His lips had turned blue . He was dripping with sweat . Suddenly , he uttered some numbers which made no sense , then some words , then bits of sentences . It was frightening . He VBD terms which were strung together in the strangest NN and which were absolutely weird . Then , he again became silent , although his lips continued to move .

They reassured him that everything was all JJ , and he gradually calmed down . ”"

When the NNP NNPS acquired it after the Mexican NNP ended in 1848 , the land that MD CD day become Colorado was nearly unpopulated by Anglo settlers . Ute , Arapaho , Cheyenne , and other Native Americans had occupied the land for centuries , but the Europeans who had made sporadic appearances there since the 17th century never stayed for RB . It was not until 1851 that the JJ permanent non-Indian settlement was established , in the San Luis Valley . As with JJ other western regions , though , the lure of gold launched the JJ major Anglo invasion . In July 1858 , a band of prospectors working streambeds near modern - day Denver VBD tiny flecks of gold in their pans . Since the gold - bearing streams were located in the foothills not far from the massive mountain named for the explorer Zebulon Pike , the subsequent influx of hopeful miners was termed the Pike ’s Peak gold rush . By the spring of 1859 , an estimated 50,000 gold seekers had reached this latest of a JJ series of JJ El Dorados . As the JJ gold - bearing streams to be discovered played out , prospectors moved westward into the rugged slopes of the Rocky Mountains in search of JJ finds . Wherever sizeable deposits were discovered , ramshackle mining camps IN Central City , Nevadaville , and Black Hawk appeared , sometimes almost overnight . Meanwhile , out on the JJ plains at the edge of the mountains , Denver became the central supply town for the miners . Although few miners came to Colorado planning to stay RB , they were eager to establish some semblance of “ law and order ” in the region in order to protect their property rights and gold dust . Far from the seats of eastern NN , the miners and townspeople cobbled together their own simple governments , usually revolving IN a miners ’ NN that regulated claims . Technically lacking in any genuine legal foundation , the miners ’ courts did maintain the minimal order needed for the mineral exploitation of the territory to continue . The unreliable mining operations soon gave NN to larger , highly capitalized and relatively permanent lode mining operations . The pioneers recognized that the vast mineral resources of the Rockies MD form the foundation of a thriving JJ NN , but the NNS settling there needed a more formal NN of laws and NN . The Congressional designation of JJ western NNS and territories had been bogged down for several NNS as southern and northern politicians fought over whether slavery MD be permitted in the JJ western regions . By 1861 , the South had seceded , clearing the NN for the northern politicians to begin creating free - labor NNS ."

As reported by CNN and others , the results of the NN , which were published in the Journal of the NNP NNP Association ( JAMA ) , reveal that , rather than evaporate or wash off , sunscreen chemicals persist and accumulate in NNS ’s bodies through their NN , which is the body ’s largest organ . CDER looked at four common chemicals VBN in conventional sunscreen NNS : avobenzone , oxybenzone , ecamsule , and octocrylene . What the agency VBD is that concentrations of three of them continue to rise inside the body with each subsequent application , and persist there for at least 24 hours after sunscreen use has ceased . According to the FDA , these four chemicals , as well as eight others that are RB commonly VBN in JJ sunscreen NNS , VBP to be better researched by manufacturers before they can receive the FDA ’s coveted designation of being “ generally regarded as safe and effective . ” “ It ’s not NN that things that you put on your NN are absorbed into the body , ” VBZ Scott Faber , senior vice NN for NN affairs at the NNP Working Group ( EWG ) , a consumer advocacy group . “ This NN is the FDA ’s NN of showing sunscreen manufacturers they VBP to do the studies to VB if chemical absorption poses NN risks . ” For related NN about the FDA , be sure to visit FDA . NN . Natural NN has been warning about dangerous sunscreen chemicals for more than a decade As the FDA catches up with the times , it ’s important to note that Natural NNP has been warning the NN about the dangers and ineffectiveness of conventional sunscreen NNS for well over a decade . As you MD recall from back in 2007 , we published The Sunscreen Myth , a comprehensive paper and CounterThink cartoon that goes into great detail about why the entire concept behind sunscreen supposedly protecting the NN against cancer is a myth – and the fact that JJ sunscreen NNS actually VBP cancer . The Sunscreen Myth RB explains how sunscreen chemicals absorb directly through the NN and immediately enter the bloodstream , loading NNS ’s bodies with all sorts of synthetic compounds that MD or MD not VB effectively detoxified and excreted by the liver and other cleansing organs . IN cigarette advertising from the past that claimed doctors favored smoking , the sunscreen hysteria of today is VBN on little more than fear - mongering and pseudoscience . Truth be VBN , our bodies VBP sunlight in order to generate NN - supportive vitamin D – a pro-hormone nutrient that ’s effectively blocked by sunscreen . “ There is no NN for sunscreen , but the cancer industry and sunscreen manufacturers have created a fictitious NN through a campaign of fear and disinformation , hypnotizing practically the entire population into believing CD of the most ridiculous ideas in the universe : that sunlight is bad for JJ NN , ” explains The Sunscreen Myth . “ They did n’t run and hide from the NN , they VBD it as nourishment to generate a crucial vitamin that supports JJ NN in a multitude of ways . The idea that “ the NN is bad for you ” makes about as much sense as ‘ NN is bad for you ’ or ‘ the NNP is JJ , ' ” it adds . It is RB recommended that readers check out “ The Trouble with Ingredients in Sunscreen , ” put out by EWG as a JJ educational resource .

Occasionally he talked about dreams with his patients or neighbouring peasants . Having overheard their chat , I joined in CD day , saying , “ I dreamed of walking on the street but I was aware that I was dreaming . So I was looking for some kind of bed to VB back to sleeping . It was a frustrating experience trying to find a bed in the streets of a village . I finally came to a JJ dark stone with a smoothly polished JJ NN . I fell asleep or out of the dream RB before my body touched the stone . ” They were all surprised by my dream , since lucid dreams are much less common for adults than NNS . In a lucid dream , the dreamer is aware of the dreaming status . He or she therefore participates in or RB manipulates the outcome of the dream . In my NN , I wanted to end the dream , and eventually I did . A JJ awakening , in which the dreamer dreamed of getting up to work or to VB to the washroom , is likely a lucid dream . A daydream MD RB be a lucid dream , if the dreamer goes far away from his waking NN of NN and is unaware of his physical and JJ environments . Since a lucid dreamer can often manipulate the imaginary experiences in the dream environment , lucid dreams can seem extremely real and vivid , depending on a person ’s level of self - awareness during the lucid dream . Recently , various techniques have been developed to induce lucid dreams . Such techniques apparently reduce the frequency and severity of nightmares . Both Buddhism and Taoism have RB been VBN to introduce lucid dream experiences in order to calm down the believer ’s NN . CD sect of Buddhism goes further to classify the JJ NN or consciousness into seven levels of awareness . There are degrees of wakefulness or awareness , and both lucid dreaming and normal waking experiences lie somewhere towards the middle of this continuum ( or hierarchy ) of awareness . In this context as the Buddhist believes , there are therefore NNS of wakefulness that are superior to normal waking awareness , such as Nirvana , which Buddhists pursue in their religious practice . In such superior awareness , the reality of our ordinary NN becomes illusory . Buddhism holds the view that NN on NN is bitter in nature . Closing his famous essay All Things Being Equal , Chuang Tzu VBZ , “ Chuang Tzu once dreamed that he was a butterfly fluttering here and there , VBG wherever he pleased . He was totally unaware of Chuang Tzu . A sudden awakening left nothing else but Chuang Tzu himself , who did not VB anything about his being a bufferfly . It is therefore unknown whether it is Chuang Tzu who dreamed of being a bufferfly or if it is a butterfly who dreamed of being Chuang Tzu . The butterfly and Chuang Tzu are completely JJ entities , and it is called transformation when an entity becomes another . ” The same essay starts with a master who leaned on his armrest while sitting lost himself in meditation . IN Buddhists , Chuang Tzu and his followers apparently mastered the techniques of lucid dreams . In the essay , Joyful Free Wandering , Chuang Tzu starts with a legendary bird , Peng , which has a body and wings that cover hundreds of NNS . It can fly three thousand NNS high . RB this gigantic bird has to rely on air or wind to fly . It is far away from Chuang Tzu ’s joyful free wandering , in which PRP goes to a vivid lucid dream at will , and relying on nothing else but himself . The dreamer can VB anywhere he pleases . His dreaming experience is so vivid and real that lucid dreams are not JJ at all from reality as far as personal experiences are concerned . Buddhism pursues a superior ideal realm , Nirvana , which lies far beyond reality . Taoism holds the view that NN on NN is so wonderful that it has to be prolonged to eternity . Taoists use lucid dreams to extend their enjoyment of NN beyond the limits of reality . NNS slip into lucid dreams more easily than adults . Similarly prehistoric or primititve NNS have more lucid dreams . Further , Erika Bourguignon , from her NN of almost 500 societies has shown that the frequency , accessibility and quality of religious experiences , correlate inversely with the complexity of JJ structure . In the simplest and most egalitarian societies , ritual trance NNS tend to be voluntary , conscious and accessible to most NNS who desire them . Scientifically “ trance ” is often termed as a transformed NN of NN . It describes lucid dreams and JJ levels of awareness in Buddhist terms . Levy - Bruhl ’s book “ Primitive Mentality ” was influential for Julian Jaynes , an JJ psychologist , who believes that all NNS lived in a hallucinatory NN more than three thousand NNS ago . Levy - Bruhl writes : “ In comparison to modern society , a greater number of individuals in primitive societies experiences hallucinations , experiences them more frequently , and the hallucinations play an important role in their day - to - day lives . ” Levy - Bruhl VBZ : “ To them the things which are unseen cannot be distinguished from the things which are seen . The beings of the unseen NN are no less directly present than those of the other ; they are more active and more formidable . Consequently that NN occupies their minds more entirely than this NN , and it diverts their minds from reflecting , RB to a slight extent , upon the NNS which we call objective . ” Both Levy - Bruhl and Erika Bourguignon indicated that hallucination was more common in ancient primitive NNS . But it only employed part of the idle NN in the primary society while it became the divine voice , in Julian Jaynes ’ bicameralism , to dictate that the NNS should obey their rulers in a secondary society . When rational thinking reflecting on objective NNS establishes itself in modern society , hallucination or bicameralism remains only in psychotic patients . Buddhism represents a religious tradition VBN on secondary societies , and so it teaches NNS how to retreat from the traumatizing reality by lucid dreams . Taoism is a religious tradition VBN on the primary society , and so it teaches NNS how to enjoy NN more without any efforts by lucid dreams .

What_WP is_VBZ presented_VBN by_IN the_DT mainstream_NN is_VBZ far_RB from_IN the_DT available_JJ truth_NN that_WDT ’s_VBZ already_RB out_RB there_RB ._.","What ’s RB VBG on in NN ? What have ‘ the JJ elite ’ tried to do in NN ? The truth is JJ NNS are starting to realize that we live in a very sheltered NN , inside a bubble that NNS are now trying to desperately pop . We ’ve been fed a lot of disinformation about discoveries that MD VB the NN we view the very nature of our reality and what it means to be JJ . Discoveries that MD have us ask the deep questions about NN , our purpose , why we are here , and where we come from . Discoveries that MD literally VB JJ consciousness forever . “ We knew that the NNP was JJ , we knew that we were the center of the universe , and we knew that a NN -made heavier than air piece of machinery MD not take flight . Through all stages of JJ history , intellectual authorities have pronounced their supremacy by ridiculing or suppressing elements of reality that simply did n’t fit within the framework of accepted NN . Are we RB any JJ today ? “ Have we RB changed our acceptance towards things that won’g fit the frame ? Maybe there are concepts of our reality we have yet to understand , and if we open our eyes , maybe we will VB that something significant has been overlooked . ” – Terje Toftenes ( source ) This ‘ something ’ significant is the fact that we are not alone . Whether it be a JJ Chairman of the Royal Navy telling us that “ there is a serious possibility that we are being visited , and have been visited by NNS from outer NN , ” or an Apollo 14 astronaut saying that “ there have been crashed craft , and bodies recovered , ” we have no shortage of high - ranking insiders attesting to the reality that some UFOs MD be extraterrestrial . There have been some very interesting leaks over the NNS that suggest the same thing . General Carlos Cavero VBD the NN in 1979 , “ everything ” has been “ in a process of investigation both in the NNP NNPS and in Spain , as well as the rest of the NN . ” On a JJ scale , “ the nations of the NN are currently working together in the investigation of the UFO phenomenon ” and there is “ an international exchange of NNS . ” ( source ) Phobos II was the last NN probe designed by the Soviet Union to explore the moons of Mars . Unexpectedly , we lost communication with it , and multiple insiders have VBN we were n’t VBN the truth about what RB happened . Today , UFOs are no longer taboo . For NNS , we ’ve experienced , as I ’ve VBN JJ times before , an “ official campaign of ridicule and secrecy ” ( Ex - NNP Director Roscoe Hillenkoetter ) of the phenomenon . The establishment in JJ ways was responsible for the foolish articles that MD constantly appear in mainstream NN publications , absolutely ridiculing a topic that is actually very real . But the tables have now turned . CD of the biggest mouthpieces for “ the establishment , ” The NNP NNP Times , admitted something that the establishment , or facets of it , have been concealing for NNS : UFOs are real . A JJ high - ranking federal NN employee , Christopher Mellon , RB wrote a NNP post article that detailed a number of UFO encounters with the NN with extreme credibility . But again , this is n’t JJ NN . In the 1950s , NNP Harry Truman went on national television announcing to the NN that UFOs are real , and that they discuss the topic at every conference that they have with the NN , that “ there ’s always things IN that VBG on , flying saucers and they ’ve had other things . ” ( source ) Official pictures and videos have RB been released , for example , a photo taken by CD Royal Canadian Air Force pilots on August 27th , 1956 in McCleod , Alberta , Canada is a great example . ( “ Physical NN Related To UFO Reports ” – The Sturrock Panel Report – Electromagnetic Effects ) ( source ) ( source ) You can VB that picture here . In this NN , the pilots were flying in a formation of four F86 Sabre jet aircraft . CD of the pilots described the phenomenon as a “ bright light which was sharply defined as disk - shaped ” that looked IN “ a shiny silver dollar sitting horizontal . ” Another pilot managed to photograph the object , as you can VB above . The US Navy has acknowledged footage showing multiple UFOs that was released a couple of NNS ago by To The Stars Academy via The Pentagon , and they ’ve recently confirmed that the videos are indeed real . There are millions of pages of documents to VB through , and thousands of statements from high ranking NNS that have been attesting to the UFO / extraterrestrial phenomenon for a very JJ NN . That being VBN , the topic is VBG ‘ mainstream ’ and it ’s always important to note that the establishment , and NN outlets IN the NNP NNP Times , CNN etc have been intelligence agency mouthpieces . They have fed the NN a lot of disinformation and the type of controlled disclosure we are seeing on this subject is probably no JJ . There is much more VBG on than what we VBP from the mainstream – they always try to VB the narrative for their own selfish purposes . It ’s always important to keep that in NN for anybody who delves deep into this subject . Are they trying to VB the narrative and spread more disinformation ? Are they trying to present a threat narrative in order to justify certain measures ? Similar to how ‘ terrorism ’ was VBN and financed by the west to justify the infiltration and takeover of other NNS in order to bring them ‘ democracy ? ’ These are important questions to ask ourselves as this topic gains more popularity . What is presented by the mainstream is far from the available truth that ’s already out there ."

He now lives in Medway , Kent . Having released CD solo albums , Turner formed the band Stuart Turner & The NNP NNP Society , who release their 5th album Scowl in the summer of 2017 . Though being an active musician for a number of NNS , and playing with a number of JJ local musicians , Turner 's JJ official solo release came on NNP Pier Records , a Chatham VBN record label distributed by Cargo , and formed by friend and fellow musician Kris Dollimore , ex-guitarist with The Damned . Turner produced Dollimore 's debut NNP Pier release ( 02/01/1978 ) in 2006 , writing a song on it ( "" The North Kent Post Industrial Hillstomp Blues "" ) which received national airplay on BBC Radio CD . Turner 's own solo appeared a few months later with his debut album , A Gallon of NNP Makes a Mile of Fog , which CD critic described as "" packed full of ideas "" . [ 2 ] Turner supported Dollimore in gigs IN England and spent 2006 and 2007 playing shows in a diverse selection of venues , including bowling alleys , cabaret clubs and Swedish festivals , which CD reviewer described as "" scaring the living daylights out of the assembled crowd with his spooky folk blues "" . [ 3 ] Turner 's second album , File Under Carnal NNP , was described a freight train riding back bar room down at heel blues "" , [ 4 ] and released on NNP Pier in February 2009 . Turner formed The NNP NNP Society with guitarist Robbie Wilkinson in 2009 to record what became the band 's JJ album Gin & Bitters . Alongside Turner and Wilkinson in the original line - up were Ray Hunt on drums and Dave Sawicki on bass ( with occasional trumpet from John Whitaker ) . The album was released on CD and digital download in July 2010 , through the independent Brigadier Records . The band added "" steam driven NN "" to his "" anguished urban blues "" , [ 5 ] and provided the opportunity for live performances IN the South East of England , including the Lounge On The Farm festival . Turner & The NNP NNP Society performed gigs to the end of 2010 , including a Christmas ball at Oxford NNP . A live version of "" Murder On Gaslight Street "" was made available for free download via Medway Eyes in October 2010 , whilst Brigadier Records released the Gin & Bitters album tracks , "" Shimmy "" and "" South NNP Blues "" as radio promos in December that NN . Gin & Bitters was followed up with the limited vinyl EP release Weekend Hearts in 2011 before the band recorded On The Brink Of Misadventure , which was their final album release with Brigadier Records . At this point , the band underwent some line - up NNS , with a JJ line - up containing Turner , Wilkinson , Nick Rice ( bass ) , Bob Collins ( guitarist formerly with The Dentists ) , Rob Shepherd ( from The Singing Loins on banjo , mandolin and accordion ) and James Kerr recording a JJ album during 2013 . At this point , the band began their association with Vacilando ' 68 Recordings in Autumn of 2013 and acquired publishing through Bucks Music Publishing . The JJ album , The Art and NNP of Phrenology : a presentation by Stuart Turner and The NNP NNP Society was released by Vacilando ' 68 in February 2014 . Steve Moore replaced James Kerr as drummer in NN for a JJ EP , The Gentleman 's Club , released by Vacilando ' 68 in October 2014 . Whilst recording what MD become the band 's 4th album , the band gigged extensively IN the South East and London and started to make in - roads into the grass roots festival circuit , with an appearance at 2015 's Bearded NNP festival a particular highlight . The 4th album , eponymously named , was released to critical acclaim by Vacilando ' 68 in April CD following a JJ period of artwork and pressing delays . The band had a CD - page feature in Maverick Magazine . With Mike Sewell replacing Steve Moore on drums , the band recorded their 5th album , to be released as Scowl in 2017 . The album RB features guest appearances from Rachel Lowrie and David Read ( of The Claim ) . Some left - over songs from the album were released as a digital only release in February 2017 . • On The Brink Of Misadventure ( 2012 , Brigadier ) • The Art and NNP of Phrenology : a presentation by Stuart Turner and The NNP NNP Society ( February 2014 , Vacilando ' 68 )"

If_IN we_PRP lose_VBP that_DT ,_, we_PRP 're_VBP all_RB in_IN trouble_NN ._.","Nick Davies is a distinguished reporter who specialises in very JJ and depressing stories for The Guardian on subjects most other journalists prefer to leave untouched , such as poverty and the failings of the criminal justice NN . He has now turned his virtuous investigative eye on his own profession . His reaction is almost spinsterish in its horror . Davies ' notion of what journalists and journalism are for is idiosyncratic , to put it mildly . Whoever VBD him that this is an industry ' supposedly dedicated ' - as he puts it in his prologue - ' to telling the truth ' ? Where did he VB the idea that journalists should be , or ever have been , reluctant to lie , cheat , deceive and resort to low tricks of every kind ? In this survey of what he calls ' a corrupted profession ' , he hardly bothers with the tabloids . ' No NN needs a book to tell them that the tabloids are an unreliable source of NN about the NN , ' he comments with lordly condescension . Sheltered from the rough NN of daily hackery , he RB disdains what he sees as the fictions of objectivity and neutrality . Journalists , Davies believes , must make judgments ; the strong implication is that these should be between good and bad . Much of his analysis is nevertheless compelling and alarming . On provincial papers , pitifully underpaid journalists spend their days rewriting press releases , while the proceedings in courts and councils VBP largely unreported . At all levels , the relentless pressure on staffing , combined with the demand for more and yet more ' NN ' , have created a culture of dependence . Journalists with no NN either to find stories or to check the NN they are given , are reduced to processing the unstoppable flow of material from the PR departments , the special interest groups , the pseudo - experts , the pseudo - researchers . Davies convincingly chronicles the success of the NNP and MI6 in planting fictions across the supposedly independent NN to VB backing for JJ assessments of the dangers posed by Iraq and Iran . He argues that Greenpeace and other eco groups have been just as eager as the fossil - fuel lobby to distort and exaggerate the available NN on JJ NN to further their own ends ( although , curiously enough , Davies omits any reference to the willingness of his own newspaper to swallow the most extreme predictions of the coming catastrophe with scarcely a flicker of scepticism ) . His last three chapters focus on The Sunday Times , The Observer , and The Daily Mail ( The Sunday Telegraph does not draw Davies 's fire ) . It comes as little surprise to find that the Mail is prejudiced against blacks , homosexuals , immigrants , lefties , NNS on benefit and so on , and that it is unscrupulous in mobilising its NN and NN to hound them ; or that Davies laments the passing of the old investigative tradition on The Sunday Times . But his assault on The Observer is something else . In the eyes of Guardian men IN Nick Davies , their sister paper The Observer and its then editor , Roger Alton , committed an unforgivable offence in declaring support for the Iraq NN . Davies directs a venomous attack on the integrity and professional competence of Alton and his JJ editor , Kamal Ahmed . He portrays them as puppets of Alastair Campbell and Tony Blair , intent on turning the paper into a mouthpiece for the NN 's NN policy , ready to suppress or bury any story that might raise doubts about Saddam Hussein 's alleged NN . Of Alton , Davies VBZ : ' His passions are far from NN , much closer to sport and women , both of whom he pursues with obsessive NN ' - a comment so unpleasant that PRP begins to suspect some ancient personal grudge . Davies deliberately underplays the extent to which Alton was prepared to allow NN and NN to the expression of anti-war sentiment ; and ignores altogether the persistence with which The Observer criticised Blair and his ministers over their domestic record , and exposed their bullying , lies and deceptions . If this travesty of what happened at The Observer represents Nick Davies 's idea of good journalism , he can keep it . Let 's be charitable and regard it as an aberration , and concentrate instead on the valuable and disturbing insights that Davies provides into a business that needs to ask a good JJ questions of itself . No NN should expect journalists to be as high - minded as Nick Davies . Theirs is - or should be - a murky , occasionally mucky , job done by NNS short on scruples and RB on curiosity , suspicious of everything and everybody , and of favours most of all . Journalists do n't VB to be clean but they must be allowed to VB the story , and they must have the confidence and courage to write it as they VBP it . If we lose that , we 're all in trouble ."

Hamilton : The 9/11 Commission was created by statute . We had CD responsibilities – RB , tell the story of 9/11 ; I VBP we ’ve done that reasonably well . We worked very hard at it ; I do n’t VB that we ’ve VBN the definitive story of 9/11 , but surely anybody in the future who tackles that job will begin with the 9/11 Commission Report . I VBP we ’ve been reasonably successful in telling the story . It became a best seller in this country and NNS showed a lot of interest in it . Our second task was to make recommendations ; thus far , about half of our recommendations have been enacted into law , the other half have not been enacted . So we ’ve got a ways to VB . In a quantitative sense , we ’ve had about 50 % success there . In a qualitative sense , you MD judge it JJ JJ ways . But we still have some very important recommendations that we VBP have not yet been enacted that should be . Solomon : Now , CD of the stipulations , you write in the book , CD of the ways that you thought that this ought to be successful , this report , the Commission Report , is on page 23 , you VBD if the JJ NNS MD accept the results as authoritative , and the recommendations . And when I measure that against a Zogby poll done in NNP , that VBZ now 42 % of Americans VBP that “ the U.S. NN , and its 9/11 Commission , concealed or refused to investigate critical NN that contradicts the official explanation of September 11th , saying there ’s a cover - up ” – 42 % , Mr. Hamilton – what does that VB to you about the efficacy of the Commission ’s report ? Hamilton : Well , it ’s dispiriting , it ’s an unusually high number , but if you look at polls judging NN reports in the past – the Warren Commission , the reports on Kennedy assassination , RB the reports on Abraham Lincoln ’s assassination – you find a very high level of NNS who are skeptical . And you have that in this NN . When you conduct a major investigation , you cannot possibly answer every question , you just do the best you can . But for every question you leave unanswered , you create an opening to a NN NN , and a good JJ of them have popped up here . The only thing I ask in the future is that the NN NN NNS do not apply a double standard . That is to VB , they VBP us to make an airtight NN for any assertion we make . On the other hand , when they make an assertion they do it often on very flimsy NN . But conspirators are always VBG to exist in this country . Tom Kean and I got a flavour of this everytime we ’d walk through an audience – they MD hand us notes , hand us papers , hand us books , hand us tapes , telling us to investigate this , that or the other . You cannot possibly answer all these questions , you just do the best you can . Solomon : Some of the families have joined that chorus . We ’ve talked to CD father who VBZ , ‘ my son was killed by George W. Bush ’ , as if the NN had foreknowledge of the attacks . What MD you VB to someone IN him and other family members who have been dissatisfied with the explanation ? Hamilton : JJ families supported the report – very strongly – and have been instrumental in helping us on the implementation stage . A lot of the NNS that have doubts about the report – not all of them – are strongly anti-Bush , for a variety of reasons . JJ of them are just anti-government , in other words , they do n’t VB anything the NN VBZ . All I ask of these NNS is : give me your NN . If you thought George Bush or Lee Hamilton or Tom Kean blew up those buildings , let ’s VB the NN . Solomon : I MD n’t VB just .. there ’s a few things , but I VBP to VB , interestingly enough , if you ’ve seen a film that ’s so popular now on the internet , ten CD NNS apparently have seen a film called Loose NNP , which makes some startling allegations . It ’s a film made by three very young students out of a NNP NNP NNP . Have you seen that movie , and if so , what are your thoughts on it ? Hamilton : I have not seen it . Solomon : Yeah … CD CD NNS , I mean , some of them .. now , and it ’s interesting that you write in CD of your chapters , I VBP it ’s Chapter 12 , deals specifically with NN NNS . CD of them , as you VBP – probably CD of the most persistent – is that the buildings were brought down by controlled explosion , controlled demolition . CD of the bits of NN that is often cited is the collapse of NNP Trade Center Building Number 7 , which was not hit by any plane . CD question that NNS have is : why did n’t the Commission deal with the collapse Building 7 , which some call the smoking gun ? Why did this collapse at all ? Hamilton : Well , of course , we did deal with it . The charge that dynamite , or whatever , brought down the NNP Trade Towers , we of course looked at very carefully – we find no NN of that . We find all kinds of NN that it was the airplanes that did it . Do n’t take our word on that : the engineers and the architects have studied this thing in extraordinary detail , and they can tell you precisely what caused the collapse of those buildings . What caused the collapse of the buildings , to summarize it , was that the super - heated jet fuel melted the steel super - structure of these buildings and caused their collapse . There ’s a powerful lot of NN to sustain that point of view , including the pictures of the airplanes flying into the building . Now , with regard to Building 7 , we VBP that it was the aftershocks of these CD huge buildings in the very near vicinity collapsing . And in the Building 7 NN , we VBP that it was a NN of flames setting off a fuel container , which started the fire in Building 7 , and that was our NN on Building 7 . Now we ’re not the experts on this , we talked to the engineers and the architects about this at some length , and that ’s the conclusion we reached . Solomon : Let me just ask you CD more question on that . CD counter - argument – or there ’s CD , I guess – CD is that that fire very rarely , and has never , forced buildings constructed IN the NNP Trade Centers to ever collapse , because steel does n’t melt at NNS that can be reached through a hydro - NN fire , and that there ’s other .. in other words , there are countless NNS of other buildings that have been on fire that have not collapsed . Hamilton : – but not on fire through jet fuel , I do n’t VB you have any NN of that . But here again , I ’m not the expert on it . We relied on the experts , and they ’re the engineers and the architects who examined this in very great detail . Solomon : A question which has remained : Why did the debris of NNP Trade Center 7 , of which nobody died there , so there was no real urgency to move the debris away , and that there have been questions : why was n’t it examined closer ? Why was essentially NN from what MD have been a crime scene – or was a crime scene – removed very quickly from there ? Hamilton : You ca n’t answer every question when you conduct an investigation . Look , you ’ve to got to remember that on this day , chaos and confusion were the mark , and peoples ’ overwhelming concern was to try to save as JJ lives as possible , not to explain why a particular building collapsed . So it ’s not unusual to me that we , and the Commission – and anybody else , for that matter – cannot answer every question . I VBP back to what I VBP earlier : whenever you conduct an investigation , you cannot answer every question . Solomon : But should the Commission have .. I guess the question some NNS keep asking , should the Commission have asked more questions about the removal of the debris ? Hamilton : Look , you can VB that about almost every phase of our investigation , ‘ you should have asked this , you should have asked that , you should have spent more NN ’ – you ’re conducting an investigation , you have a NN limit , you do n’t have unlimited NN , you have a budget limit , you cannot VB down every track , you cannot answer conclusively every question . The members of the families that you referred to a minute ago submitted 150 questions to us – we answered a good JJ of them , we did n’t answer them all . You come to a point in an investigation where you have to VB to yourself , ‘ what ’s our responsibility , given the resources we have , how much can we do ? ’ And you end up with a lot of questions unanswered . Look , I ‘ve got a lot of unanswered questions in my NN . Solomon : What are yours ? What are your unanswered questions ? Hamilton : Well , at the top of my list happens to be a personal NN , and that is , I MD never figure out why these CD fellas did what they did . We looked into their backgrounds . In CD or CD NNS , they were apparently happy , well - adjusted , not particularly religious – in CD NN quite well - to - do , had a girlfriend . We just MD n’t figure out why he did it . I still do n’t VB . And I VBP CD of the great unanswered questions – a good topic for investigative reporters – MD be : why did these CD do what they did ? We speculated in the report about why the enemy hates us , but we simply were n’t able to answer the questions about the CD . Solomon : You VBP , just on that point , and again , there are so JJ of these questions about the CD . There have been some questions about – and I ’m talking about sources here IN the London Times and Le Figaro , sort of major newspapers – that some of these guys , some of these hijackers were still alive after the day of the event , that there are reports of their whereabouts . What did the Commission make of those kind of reports ? Hamilton : ( Laughs ) What ’s the NN ? Look , I had a woman come up to me who VBD she was a lover of Mohammed Atta . And I VBD , ‘ do you VB that he ’s dead ? ’ And she VBD , ‘ I ’m his lover . ’ .. ( raises eyebrows ) You VBP all kinds of comments IN this , you ca n’t trace everything down . Solomon : Where there any notion there was … The NTSB recently released the flight path of NNP Flight 93 in the past CD weeks . CD of the interesting things that that showed was , during the flight path , and I VBP the flight path of that , I VBP that plane crashed , according to the Report , at 10:03 am . And CD of the interesting things it showed – this is just recently declassified – that it flew well over 10,000 NNS – 30,000 , 40,000 NNS – from about 9:30 onward . Now , a lot of the cell phone calls that were made from that plane , that ended up being in the movie , were from , you VBP , NNS phoning from the plane . And CD allegation that ’s recently come out since the release of that is : cell phones do n’t work above 10,000 NNS , so how MD NNS VB on their cell phone on a plane and phone their relatives ? Hamilton : I ’m no expert on that . I ’ve been VBN cell phones work – sometimes – above 10,000 NNS , and as high as 30,000 NNS . So it MD have been that some of the calls went through and some did n’t , I just do n’t VB . Solomon : Let me ask you another thing . I ’m just asking because , you VBP , in the wake of this , there ’s lots of these questions . Solomon : The Lamont Doherty NNP Observatory at Columbia NNP , which is about 20 odd NNS away from NNP NNP , they released a report on seismic NNS coming from Manhattan on that day . And they released a spike in seismic NNS at 8:46:26 , and they thought that was the moment of impact of the plane on the JJ NNP Trade Center , of NNP Airlines 11 . But the plane did n’t hit until 8:46:40 , and there are several of the same kind of early seismic spikes for the second flight . I guess the question is : how do we explain those discrepancies ? When the NN looks at that , how can we explain that kind of thing ? Hamilton : I have n’t seen that report . I do n’t VB the answer to your question . They did n’t come forward with that NN while we were at the Commission – so far as I VBP . Now , staff filtered a lot of these things , so not necessarily MD I VB . I do n’t VB what happened with regard to the… . What did they conclude ? I do n’t VB what they concluded . Solomon : They had no conclusion ; the NN is sitting out there . You write about , in Chapter 12 of the book – and again it ’s CD of those allegations that have come up – about who had foreknowledge of it ? CD piece of NN that JJ critics have VBN is : ‘ well , there is lots of ‘ puts ’ – which is a form of financial NN trading . In other words , NNS are buying up NN , hoping that the airline NN MD plunge , and there was an unusually JJ number of puts on NNP Airlines and NNP NN , and therefore NNS profited from this . What did you make of that NN ? Hamilton : That ’s CD we did investigate . We looked at that pretty carefully , and all I can indicate at this point is that we do not VB anybody profited from manipulation of airline NN prior to 9/11 , there ’s no NN of that , I do n’t VB . Hamilton : That ’s correct . It ’s not unusual in the NN NN to have a lot of activity in a given NN , or industry , as you did here . The question is : did any of them have foreknowledge and profit from it ? We do n’t VB so ; we looked at it pretty carefully . Solomon : There ’s RB allegations that the Pakistani Secret Service , called the ISI , the head of which met here in the NNP NNPS RB before 9/11 , and there ’s some allegations and NN to show that they paid Mohammed Atta $ 100,000 . The reason this is important is : who funded the NNS who conducted the attacks , the terrorist attacks ? What did the Commission make of payment from the ISI to Mohammed Atta of $ 100,000 ? Hamilton : I do n’t VB anything about it . Solomon : Was there any connection between .. Did the Commission investigate any connection between ISI , Pakistani intelligence , and .. Hamilton : They MD have ; I do not recall us writing anything about it in the report . We MD have but I do n’t recall it . We did estimate that Osama bin Laden spent about $ 500,000 for the 9/11 attacks . We did not identify all the sources of that NN . Solomon : And how it got to the … Hamilton : That ’s JJ , you simply can’t trace it , so far as I VBP , because $ 500,000 in international financial markets is not RB a blip on the radar screen . So we do not VB precisely where that NN came from . Solomon : Questions about foreknowledge , especially as to when Vice NNP Dick Cheney knew when he went down to the protective bunker : there was some suggestion that the Secretary of Transport Mineta testified in front of the Commission that he in fact talked to Dick Cheney at 9:20 am . Cheney claims he had n’t been there .. gotten down there until close to CD am . That was eventually omitted from the final report , . Can you tell us a bit about about what Secretary of Transport Mineta VBD the Commission about where Dick Cheney was prior to CD am ? Solomon : And we do n’t VB exactly where that .. Hamilton : Well , we VBP that Vice NNP Cheney entered the bunker shortly before CD o’clock . And there is a gap of several minutes there , where we do not RB VB what the Vice NNP RB did . There is the famous phone call between the NNP and the Vice NNP . We MD find no documentary NN of that phone call . Both the NNP and the Vice NNP VBD that the phone call was made , and in that phone call , the order was supposedly was given , allegedly given , to shoot down an airliner – if necessary Now , there are a lot of things not answered about that period of NN . The order never got to the pilots and when it did VB to the pilots , it did n’t VB to them in NN , and when it did VB to them , they claimed it was not an order to shoot it down , but to identify and track an airliner , not to shoot it down . What you had on this day , of course , was a lot of confusion , and a lot of confusion in communications , at the very highest levels . When the NNP went from the school in Sarasota to Air Force CD , he was trying to VB communications with the White NNP , he VBD a cell phone , in part . When he got to Air Force CD , the communications did n’t work all that well . Well , this is all very disturbing , and I ’m VBN has now been corrected . Solomon : Disturbing in what NN ? Hamilton : Well , disturbing that , at this particular NN , the Commander in Chief lost communications with the White NNP , and with his chief aides there , RB in the middle of a NN – that ’s very disturbing . I hope that ’s been corrected , I ’ve been VBN that it has been . But the fact of the matter is , if you look at 9/11 , all the NN through , FAA communications , NORAD communications , White NNP communications , there was just a lot of confusion , and a lot of gaps . Solomon : So , just in terms of Mineta , just because I VBP that ’s sort of interesting , when Secretary Mineta made at your Commission hearing , I VBP he did this NNP 23rd , that he arrived and talked to Dick Cheney at 9:20 – that MD show that Mr. Cheney had had some earlier NN that planes had been hijacked and they wanted to take NN . That was not – Hamilton : What did the Secretary VB at that NN to the Vice NNP ? Solomon : They talked about a plane being hijacked , according to the testimony that I ’ve seen , according to the Mineta report . But there ’s another NN , in Richard Clarke ’s book , “ Against All Enemies ” , and I VBP Richard Clarke took the stand very famously – not the stand , but testified before the Commission very famously – he VBZ he received authorization from Dick Cheney to shoot down Flight 93 at about 9:50 am . In the Commission ’s Report , it VBD the authorization did n’t come from Dick Cheney until 10:25 , and Richard Clarke ’s testimony that he and his book , is n’t mentioned in the Commission ’s .. Why did n’t you mention that ? Hamilton : Look , you ’ve obviously gone through the report with a fine - toothed comb , you ’re raising a lot of questions – I can do the same thing … Hamilton : .. all I VBP from you is NN . You ’re just citing a lot of things , without any NN to back them up , as far as I can VB . Solomon : No , I ’m just asking why they were n’t – Hamilton : I do n’t VB the answer to your question . Solomon : I guess part of the reason is .. Hamilton : I cannot answer every question with regard to 9/11 . I can answer a good JJ of them , but I ca n’t answer them all . Solomon : I guess , Mr. Hamilton , I do n’t VB anyone expects you to have all the answers … Hamilton : Well , you apparently do , because you have asked me questions of enormous detail from a great variety of sources . You VBP me to answer them all – I ca n’t do it ( laughs ) Solomon : I guess part of the reason is I VBP to VB , not necessarily what the answer is , but if the Commission considered , you VBP , what made it into the report , in terms of the discussion . And of course , what we ’re trying to understand is , if the commission simply VBD ‘ you VBP , those kinds … there was huge amounts of NNS , and we MD n’t put everything in ’ . So I guess , you VBP , in questions about what happened on 9/11 as we approach the fifth anniversary of that day , and this being the kind of most extensive document that the NN has , there are questions as to what made it in and what you heard , and what you did n’t . And that , I VBP , those are the nature of the questions . Hamilton : Yeah . A lot of things that came to the attention of staff did not come to the attention of the Commission . Some of the things did come to the attention of the Commission , and we did n’t put ’em in , or at least we put ’em in at a lower level . But JJ of the things did not come directly to my attention . Solomon : Part of what you write in the book is that CD of the key goals here was to be as transparent and as open as possible , because you VBP ‘ without light , the NN theorists jump in . ’ Solomon : Now , CD place that you shed a lot of light on – and you write about it in this book [ “ Without Precedent ” ] as well – is a place where NN theorists , as you call them , have jumped in , which is the plane that hit the Pentagon . As you and I both VBP , there ’s a number of publications that [ VB ] the hole in the Pentagon was too JJ to accomodate a plane of that , you VBP , 125 NN wingspan , 40 NNS high , and that it was a missile . What did you make – what did the Commission , when it heard all those kind of ideas , how did you consider those , and what investigation went on IN those ? Hamilton : Well , we VBD an airplane went into the Pentagon . And we VBD that jet fuel there too caused an awful lot of the damage and the injury . We had CD member of the staff who had been badly , badly burned by jet fuel , and as you VBP , jet fuel causes specific kinds of burns , and these burns were from jet fuel . So all of our NN indicated a plane went in , and that ’s what the eyewitnesses VBD that we saw . Solomon : And you VBP , this notion – and this is maybe CD of the most popular NNS , and you VBP it all over – is that reports initially came back from the Pentagon that there was no debris at all , that the plane simply disintegrated inside the Pentagon . To those NNS , those of us who have seen aviation accidents , that sounded in some ways difficult to VB , because there was such a huge plane , and the maneuvre that it MD require the pilot to make MD have been , you VBP , to fly into it seemed so astonishing . What did the commission make of the debate , such as it is , that surrounds that ? Hamilton : We thought it was an airplane Solomon : Was there any debris ? Hamilton : My recollection is , the answer ’s yes . Was there a lot of debris ? I do n’t VB so . To VB that there was no debris strains my recollection , I did n’t remember it that NN , I thought there was some debris . But you VBP , you have relatively little experience with planes highly loaded with jet fuel crashing , ( chuckles ) and reconstructing exactly what happened on the basis of the crash . We did the best we MD on it . We thought it was an airplane . There were a number of eyewitnesses , of course , who saw the plane VB into the Pentagon , a number of NNS , for example , who were driving on the roadway – I forget the number of it RB now – who had the airplane fly over their cars into the building , and they stopped their car , and saw the plane VBG into the Pentagon – that was not CD , that was a number of eyewitnesses . We relied upon that , of course . Solomon : And you VBP , when you .. You ’ve spoken with JJ of the witnesses , your Commission heard testimony from all sorts of JJ NNS . So when you hear these kind of ongoing allegations that there was conflicting reports of the witnesses ; that the FBI confiscated tapes from the gas station across the road , that supposedly saw it within a day of it ; that some of those witnesses disappeared .. what do you make of those kind of … Hamilton : I do n’t VB for a minute that we got everything JJ . We wrote a JJ draft of history . We wrote it under a lot of NN pressure , and we sorted through the NN as best we MD . Now , it MD be RB rather remarkable if we got everything JJ . So far , of the things that have been brought up challenging the report , to my NN , we have more credibility than the challenger . But I MD not for a moment VB to suggest that that ’s always JJ , either in the past or in the future . NNS will be investigating 9/11 for the next hundred NNS in this country , and they ’re VBG to find out some things that we missed here . So I do n’t automatically reject all the NN you cite . It MD be we missed it , it MD be we ignored it when we should n’t have – I do n’t VB we did , but it ’s possible . Solomon : You write .. the JJ chapter of the book is ‘ the Commission was set up to fail . ’ – my goodness , for the critics – who suggest that it was indeed set up to fail as some kind of obfuscation – you certainly dangled a juicy piece of bait out there in the river . Why do you VB you were set up to fail ? Hamilton : Well , for a number of reasons : Tom Kean and I were substitutes – Henry Kissinger and George Mitchell were the JJ choices ; we got started late ; we had a very short NN frame – indeed , we had to VB it extended ; we did not have enough NN – 3 CD dollars to conduct an extensive investigation . We needed more , we got more , but it took us a while to VB it . We had a lot of skeptics out there , who RB did not VB the Commission formed . Politicians do n’t VB somebody looking back to VB if they made a mistake . The Commission had to report JJ , just a few days before the Democratic National Convention met , in other words , RB in the middle of a JJ campaign . We had a lot of NNS strongly opposed to what we did . We had a lot of trouble getting access to documents and to NNS . We knew the history of commissions ; the history of commissions were they .. nobody paid much attention to ’em . So there were all kinds of reasons we thought we were set up to fail . We decided that if we were VBG to have any success , we had to have a unanimous report , otherwise the Commission report MD simply be filed . Solomon : I guess the question is , you VBP , if forty odd CD dollars were spent investigating NNP NNP NNP ’s sexual infidelities , why did the JJ NNS and the NN have to wait 441 days for a commission that was originally budgeted for 3 CD dollars and given barely a NN , and as you write in the book and document so well , was … had to fight to VB access to RB use its subpoena NN very judiciously , for fear that there ’d be a backlash against the Commission . I mean , an event as cataclysmic as 9/11 , it begs the question : why was the administration so unwilling to budget this thing , and then Congress so unwilling to give NN and let you guys VB whole hog to do more ? Hamilton : ( Laughs ) I VBP basically it ’s because they were afraid we were VBG to hang somebody , that we MD point the finger , RB in the middle of a presidential campaign – ‘ Mr. Bush , this was your fault ’ – or RB Mr. NNP . NNP NNP was wary about this report too . Now I VBP to VB , eventurally both presidents cooperated , but it took a while . And it ’s not too unusual for me to understand that they were skeptical . A commission that is created does not have automatic credibility – we had to work at that , we had to produce a lot of reports which were recognized , fortunately , to be professionally done , seriously done – and not out to hang anybody . Solomon : Sorry , but why not out to hang anybody ? This idea , ‘ they did n’t VB to point fingers ’ , that you were n’t out to ‘ hang anybody ’.. Good NNP , I thought the families were saying , ‘ let ’s find out not just what happened , but who is accountable ’ – you VBP , that famous testimony of Richard Clarke , in front of your commission , when he VBD , “ I failed you . ” Were n’t NNS wanting you to point fingers and make someone accountable ? Hamilton : Yes I VBP they were . And we VBP , in the book , that there was a thirst for accountability . Now , part of that thirst was just to tell the story . This traumatic event occurs and they wanted to understand why it occurred , and we tried to tell that as best we MD . NN ’s not very good at looking back and criticizing itself , and CD of the things that impressed us over and over again , as we talked to CD agency after the other , is : they had not RB met and turned this over in their NN ; NN is always operating on the Inbox , and we were critical of almost every agency , in not looking back and asking what went wrong . So I VBP that ’s a powerful factor in NN , and … Solomon : It does RB suggest – I mean , there is that factor – but you VBP , what the NN often .. now , and again , I talk about the 9/11 families , who were so instrumental in getting the Commission VBG .. Solomon : They VBD , ‘ listen , is CD of the reasons they ’re not getting funded , and it ’s so late , is that someone ’s got something to hide . Hamilton : There is … well , a lot of NNS have things to hide . Solomon : Well who in this NN ? Hamilton : Look , you can VB down the list and probably identify a hundred NNS who made mistakes that day : t he ticket - taker at the Boston Logan airport ; the customs official who let these fellows in , not CD but JJ times , RB up to NNP NNP or George Bush . Solomon : What were their errors ? Hamilton : They did n’t pay enough attention to terrorism . They did n’t treat it with enough urgency . They did n’t RB anticipate this , RB though there were JJ voices , you mentioned Richard Clarke a few times , who were clearly urging them ‘ do it ’ – he served both presidents . What we decided was CD things : the mandate did not ask us to identify NNS or RB did not use the word ‘ accountability ’ . We did not VB to VB beyond our mandate . Secondly , what we thought was RB important in all of this was not so much that a particular person failed in their responsibility , whatever that responsibility might be , but that there were systemic problems in the NN that we RB thought VB to be identified and corrected . We VBP that , had we gone into the question of identifying a hundred NNS here who goofed up on 9/11 , or prior to 9/11 , and did not do their job responsibly , we MD have gone outside the mandate of the Commission , we MD absolutely have destroyed any opportunity for unanimity of view , because the Commission MD have bogged down with whether Jim Smith or Sally Jones had done their job RB , and that ’s an unending task . Solomon : In retrospect , CD of the criticisms that you level in this book “ Without Precedent ” is aimed at both the FAA and NORAD , both of whom representatives testified before the Commission , and both of whom gave what to me – and I ’m allowed to be much more impolite than you – sounded to me IN lies . They VBD you testimony that simply … the tapes that were subsequently .. that have subsequently been revealed , were simply not JJ . Solomon : And it was n’t just lies by ommission , in some senses lies of commission , they VBD you things that basically did n’t happen . What do you make of that ? Hamilton : Well , I VBP you ’re JJ . They gave us inaccurate NN . We asked for a lot of material and a lot of documentation . They did not supply it all . They gave us a few things . We sent some staff into their headquarters . We identified a lot more documents and tapes , they eventually gave them to us , we had to issue a subpoena to VB them . Eventually they VBD us we had the story RB , they had it wrong , it took a while to VB to that point , but we eventually got here . Did they lie to us or was it inadvertent ? We are not a law enforcement agency , we did not have that kind of authority , VBG back to the mandate again . All of us had our suspicions here , but we simply did not have the staff and we were RB up against the deadline when this came out , that we did n’t have the NN to VB that these officials had willfully and intentionally lied . So we punted – and we VBD , ‘ we ca n’t do this , we do n’t have the statutory authority , we do n’t have the staff ’ , we do n’t have the NN ’ . We will tell the story as we understood it – they did mislead us . Was it wilful ? We do n’t VB . We ’ll turn it over to the authorities , and that ’s what we did . Hamilton : They are now still investigating . Solomon : The recently released transcripts of what happened at NEADS , which is the Northeast Air Defence , paints a startling picture of confusion . Hamilton : I VBP that ’s the JJ word : enormous confusion , CD of these airplanes that crashed were never identified . At CD point , they had the JJ JJ jets chasing a phantom jet out in the Atlantic Ocean – in other words , VBG in the wrong direction . The NN had very little warning , I VBP , 2 minutes on CD plane and 11 minutes on the other , if my recollection serves me RB , and the disappointing thing here is that our , in a sense , JJ line of defense did n’t work . Solomon : So is the story – and again , and I talk about those polls , 42 % of Americans – your report very much … and subsequent things that have been released , subsequent tapes from places IN NORAD , the air defence systems , suggest a mass failure of the JJ line of defense , which is incompetence and confusion which led to the lack of prevention of this . Solomon : Now what happens when you VBP on to these [ talk radio ] shows , and you talk about that , and you VBP every – because you understand that the landscape is now littered with that stuff . What do you VB to all these reports that are coming in – constantly ? Hamilton : I VBP NNS do not sufficiently understand how complicated conducting a major investigation is , and how difficult it is , in an event of this kind , to chase down every answer to every question , and … Look , I can VB before any audience in NNP today and I can raise so JJ questions about 9/11 – raise questions , not answer questions , raise questions – about the investigation . And everbody in the audience will walk out saying ‘ the NN misled us or lied to us . ’ It ’s a very easy thing to do ! I can raise questions about our own report ! Solomon : UH what ? What MD you raise ? Hamilton : Well , IN I just VBD , about the CD hijackers , we did n’t answer that question . We had to tell that story as best we MD , and we did , and we made a lot of judgments about the credibility of NN . Were we JJ in every NN ? I suspect not . Were we JJ in most NNS ? I VBP so . I do not VB at this point of any factual error in our report , that I MD absolutely VB ‘ we just plain missed it . ’ Now , maybe I VBP to review it more carefully , but I cannot recall RB now at this instance any fact that we just plain missed . Solomon : Not that you got wrong , but the fact that was omitted ? Hamilton : Well , I VBP there were a lot of questions that we MD not answer , with regard to FAA and NORAD and White NNP activity , and a lot of other things , we just ca n’t answer ’em . Solomon : Is there anything in retrospect .. I mean , your deadline was so tight , and you VBP that forced you to make some very tough decisions as to how far ranging the investigation MD be . In retrospect , if you ’d had more NN , what MD you have investigated more thoroughly ? Hamilton : I MD have , I VBP we spent – if I were critiquing the work of the Commission – I VBP we spent too much NN on the question of access . And I MD have liked to have gotten that over with , VB , in the JJ half of the Commission ’s work , so that we MD have spent more NN in putting the story together , maybe trying to answer some of the questions you raise that I can’t answer – and polishing the recommendations . But you do n’t … everything does n’t VB IN you VBP it to VB , and we were fighting the question of access RB up to the end of the Commission ’s work . Solomon : CD last thing before we VBP : you had , of course , Vice NNP Dick Cheney and NNP George Bush testify together – not under oath , with no transcript that MD be made to the NN . For a lot of the family members , and a lot of the NN , they thought ‘ so JJ other NNS testified under oath , so JJ other NNS had JJ testimony – why not the NNP and the Vice NNP ? ’ That again looked as though they were trying to obfuscate or hide something – what ’s your view on that ? Hamilton : I do n’t remember any NN that a NNP of the NNP NNPS , on a non-criminal matter , testified under oath . I do recall when NNP Johnson was asked to testify to the Warren Commission , he just JJ out VBD him , ‘ I am not VBG to do it . Presidents of the NNP NNPS do n’t do that sort of thing . ’ Hamilton : He wrote a letter . Now , we asked NNP Bush and Vice NNP Cheney to testify , they VBD no . We went back to it , we VBD , ‘ look , we will have no credibility as a commission if we do not hear from you . ’ They considered that . They came back to us and VBD , ‘ we will talk to you – Tom Kean and Lee Hamilton – but not the other commissioners . ’ We VBD that was not satisfactory , ‘ you had to talk to all ten of the Commission . ’ I VBP into this detail just to tell you there was a JJ course of negotiation here . Eventually they VBD they MD both testify – not testify but meet with us – all ten commissioners – in the White NNP . There MD be note takers , but no transcript taken . Tom and I asked the question , ‘ can we VB the NN we VBP under this arrangement ? We answered that ‘ yes ’ . In the actual appearance with the NNP and the Vice NNP , they were exceedingly co-operative . The NN sat there for four hours and responded to questions . At CD point , Tom Kean interrupted CD of the Commissioners , Richard Ben-Veniste , as I VBP we tell in the book , and VBD , ‘ Richard , we have got to respect the NNP ’s NN . ’ And the NNP VBD , ‘ look , I ’m in charge here , I ’ll take the NN , and let Richard ask his questions . ’ We felt IN we got a very extended JJ period of NN with the NN . He was completely candid . He did almost all the talking . Vice NNP Cheney talked only with reference to what happened at the White NNP on 9/11 , because the NNP was not in the White NNP then , and took any question we had , and we had a lot of questions . Solomon : Do you wish there was a JJ transcript of that ? Hamilton : If we had our preference , MD there be a JJ transcript ? It ’s fine with me . But it was a White NNP call . Solomon : I just VBP to clarify something that you VBD earlier . You VBD that the Commission Report did mention NNP Trade Center Building 7 in it , what happened . It did mention it or it did n’t ? Hamilton : The Commission reviewed the question of the Building 7 collapse . I do n’t VB specifically if it ’s in the Report , I ca n’t recall that it is , but it , uh .. Solomon : I do n’t VB it was in the report . Hamilton : OK , then I ’ll accept your word for that . Solomon : There was a decision not to put it in the report ? Hamilton : I do not recall that was a specific discussion in the Commission and we rejected the idea of putting Building 7 in , I do n’t recall that . So I presume that the report was written without reference to Building 7 at all , because all of the attention , of course , was on the Trade tower buildings . Solomon : And the black boxes on the planes : CD bit of NN I just got asked about , if it came up , was : the last 3 minutes of the black box on Flight 93 has not been made JJ or is missing , or I do n’t VB what ’s happening . Was there any discussion as to what happened to those last three minutes ? Hamilton : I do not recall any reference to the black box . Solomon : Were they all VBN ? Hamilton : I do not VB , off hand , I do not VB . Solomon : Mr. Hamilton , I VBP to thank you so much for taking the NN .. Solomon : .. and for discussing the book . What ’s the reaction , by the NN , from the families to this book ? Hamilton : Well , the families are a lot of JJ NNS . And JJ of them have been very enthusiastic . I understand there is a book coming out which will be quite critical of the work of the 9/11 Commission . You had all kinds of reactions among the families : some NNS MD just VB to forget the whole thing and move on with their lives – NNS react differently to tragedy . Others , as you VBP , were enormously supportive of the Commission . Some began very supportive of the Commission , and became critical of what we did , and and they ended up not liking our recommendations – I do n’t VB that they criticized the report itself so much . But everybody has a … When you VBP ‘ the families ’ , it includes a lot of JJ attitudes and viewpoints . Solomon : What keeps you up at night about 9/11 still ? Hamilton : Not very much , I ’ve turned my attention now to homeland security , and a lot of things bother me there ."

The legendary investor Warren Buffett knows better than to make predictions . "" We have no idea - and never have had - whether the NN is VBG to VB up , down , or sideways in the near - or intermediate - term future , "" he wrote in his 1986 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders . Yet the Oracle of Omaha MD n't resist making a few guesses about the future over the NNS . We 've gathered 12 of his most intriguing predictions and assessed their accuracy in the slideshow below . "" In terms of cryptocurrencies generally , I can VB almost with certainty that they will come to a bad ending , "" Buffett VBD in an interview with CNBC in January 2018 . "" Now , when it happens or how or anything else , I do n't VB . "" He added : "" If I MD buy a five - NN put on every CD of the cryptocurrencies , I 'd be glad to do it , but I MD never short a dime 's worth . "" Buffett has been JJ about cryptocurrencies so far . At the NN of his prediction , bitcoin traded above $ 14,000 . The cryptocurrency slumped below $ 4,000 by the end of 2018 , and it's now trading at about $ 5,200 . "" Ships will sail IN the NN , but the NNP NNP Society will flourish , "" Buffett VBD in a speech at Columbia 's business school in NNP 1984 . Buffett MD have been making a point about stubborn denialism in financial markets , but his prediction about so - called JJ - earthers was correct - they 've enjoyed a resurgence in recent NNS . "" It is fitting that the visit of Halley 's NNP coincided with this percentage gain : neither will be seen again in my lifetime , "" Buffett VBD Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in 1985 after the conglomerate grew its net worth by 48.2 % . He RB predicted that the 23.2 % compounded annual growth in the NN 's per-share book value that NN was "" another percentage that will not be repeated . "" It took nearly 20 NNS for Buffett to prove himself wrong on the JJ count . Berkshire Hathaway 's net worth jumped by 48.3 % in 1998 , though that was largely because the NN issued shares for acquisitions . "" Normally , a gain of 48.3 % MD call for handsprings - but not this NN , "" he VBD investors . Buffett 's second prediction was RB off the mark . Berkshire Hathaway 's per-share book value rose by 23.3 % in 1986 . It has RB grown by at least 23.2 % in more than CD other NNS since 1985 . Buffett VBD students at the NNP of Kansas in NNP 2005 that Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert MD struggle to revitalize the department - store chain . He warned that rivals such as Walmart and Costco MD undercut Sears , which had just been acquired by Kmart . "" Eddie is a very smart guy , but putting Kmart and Sears together is a tough hand , "" Buffett VBD . "" Turning IN a retailer that has been slipping for a JJ NN MD be very difficult . "" Buffett was JJ on the NN . Sears filed for bankruptcy protection in October . However , some hope remains : Lampert recently won NN approval to buy the 126 - NN - old retailer out of bankruptcy and escape liquidation . "" We expect to keep permanently our three primary holdings , Capital Cities / ABC , Inc. , Geico Corporation , and The NNP Post , "" Buffett VBD Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in his 1986 letter . "" RB if these securities were to appear significantly overpriced , we MD not anticipate selling them , just as we MD not sell NNP 's or Buffalo Evening NNP if someone were to offer us a NN far above what we VBP those businesses are worth , "" he added . Despite his best intentions , Buffett can't resist a great deal . Berkshire Hathaway sold its stake in Capital Cities / ABC to The Walt Disney NNP in 1996 in a cash - and - NN deal worth $ 2.5 CD . He RB flogged his NN 's 28 % stake in The Post to Graham Holdings in a deal worth more than $ 1.1 CD in 2014 , according to the newspaper . The Graham family sold The Post to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in a $ 250 CD deal in 2013 . Berkshire Hathaway remains a major investor in Geico , NNP 's Candies , and The Buffalo NNP . "" In 1988 we made major purchases of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Pfd. ( ' Freddie Mac ' ) , "" Buffett VBD Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in his letter that NN . "" We expect to hold these securities for a JJ NN . In fact , when we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements , our favorite holding period is forever . "" Luckily for Buffett , he changed his NN . Berkshire Hathaway sold nearly all its Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae shares in 2000 , slashing its holding to 0.3 % from 8.6 % in 1999 . Buffett VBD the Financial NNP Inquiry Commission in 2010 that he had become "" concerned "" about the NNS ' management . "" They were trying to and proclaiming that they MD increase earnings per share in some low double - digit range or something of the sort , "" he VBD . "" And any NN a JJ financial institution starts promising regular earnings increases , you 're VBG to have trouble , you VBP ? "" "" No sensible observer - not RB these NNS ' most vigorous competitors , assuming they are assessing the matter honestly - questions that Coke and Gillette will dominate their fields worldwide for an investment lifetime , "" Buffett wrote in his 1996 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders . "" Indeed , their dominance will probably strengthen . Both NNS have significantly expanded their already huge shares of NN during the past ten NNS , and all signs point to their repeating that performance in the next decade . "" Buffett 's claims have proved sound so far : Both Coke and Gillette remain the biggest players in their markets , though the latter is under mounting pressure . Coca - Cola 's share of the US soft - drinks NN was 41 % in 1991 , compared with Pepsi's 33 % , and outsold its archrival fourfold in overseas markets , according to The NNP NNP Times .

He ’s RB made more than his share of mistakes throughout his JJ NN , which is why he was the perfect person to become Rolling Stone ’s newest advice columnist . In his second “ Ask Croz ” column , Crosby takes on anti-vaxxers , open marriages , and finding meaning in your NN after devastating loss . I ’ve been married for 15 NNS , and I ’m starting to feel pretty bored . I VBP the only NN this can work in the JJ run is if my wife agrees to an open relationship . How do I broach this topic without her VBG insane ? Can open marriages work ? — Evan , Raleigh , North Carolina No . I VBP that because I tried it . Look , I ’m the guy that wrote “ Triad . ” I tried it , VB me . I tried it every which NN . What happens is we ’re imperfect beings and we VBP jealous of each other and if you ’re VBG with CD JJ girls , CD of them is VBG to VB jealous of the other NN . It happens almost every NN . I VBP NNS that have done it for a number of NNS and they have balanced each other . But generally , when a guy wants an open marriage , he just means he wants to VB laid and he wants permission to scout RB and hit on other girls . You ca n’t do that . It ’s not VBG to work . I mean , you can do it , but your love is never VBG to love you and trust you . You ’ll never VB to the level that I ’m at with my wife , where she trusts me . She knows I ’m not VBG to screw RB because I have n’t done it in 42 NNS and I ’m not VBG to start now . My sister refuses to vaccinate her kids . She ’s worried it ’ll VB them to be autistic . I ’m worried they are VBG to VB NNS or worse . MD I be wrong to take them to a NN without her knowing ? I VBP a NN who ’ll do it . — Summer , Portland , Oregon This is serious business . The anti-vaxxers are wrong . They are absolutely wrong . Their NN is incorrect and vaccinating NNS does not VB NN . Period . NN is an entirely JJ thing . Read Steve Silberman ’s book [ NeuroTribes : The Legacy of NNP and the Future of Neurodiversity ] and you will understand NN a lot better . NNS who are selling the anti-vaxxer nonsense are the same NNS who VBP the NN is JJ . They are just ignorant and wrong . And the problem comes in when you ’re in inflicting this on someone else . You ’re saying your kid ca n’t have the medicine , but you are pushing your ignorance and stupidity on your kid and that can hurt them very , very badly . But that ’s not the worst part . The worst part is you can VB a whole bunch of other NNS to VB sick . That is an irresponsibility I can hardly countenance at all . I can’t . There is n’t any NN I can find any forgiveness in my heart for NNS that do that . It is utterly stupid . All of the NN contradicts it and you ’re doing great harm . NNS trying to tell you it ’s not are selling you a load of crap . I am 60 , widowed and childless . I am looking for ways to put NN in my NN . How do I lose that old - and - in - the - NN feeling ? — Elizabeth , Rock Hill , South Carolina You VBP to do it honestly . Look at yourself and VB where there is something that matters enough to you to VB off your butt and VB out there and do it . Maybe its the Women ’s March or helping out at the local old NNS ’s shelter or maybe helping NNS who are homeless . Look for something that gives calm and purpose to your NN and fills up your day with a bunch of RB great stuff . The NN I judge NNS , CD of the JJ things I ask myself when meeting someone and making a judgment is , “ Who have they helped ? ” That ’s a NN to give purpose to your NN that is RB , RB good . Half the NNS on the NN VBP NN in CD NN or another : Food , shelter , clothing , a loving hand , somebody who gives a shit . They VBP that . If you can do that , you ’re doing a good deed . You ’re helping . You ’re lifting . Please keep the questions for Croz coming . You can e-mail them to askcroz@rollingstone or simply tweet them with the hashtag # AskCroz . Please make sure you are asking for legit NN advice . We ’ve gotten JJ questions about his music career and they ’re all very interesting , but not what we ’re looking for here ."

"" What You Are n’t Being VBN About The NN You Live In How The “ NN NN ” Label Was Conceived To Derail The Truth Movement How Covert JJ Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate , Deceive , and Destroy Reputations Feared Collapse Of And In CD IN Russian Dread By : Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Western Subscribers A highly disturbing Security Council ( SCRF ) report circulating in the Kremlin today is warning that the coming NN , CD , MD very well VB the collapse of the governments of the NNP NNPS and Saudi Arabia as the citizens in both of these nations have begun revolting against the massive corruption these regimes rule by — and which should they both collapse MD launch upon the entire NN an “ era of unprecedented instability ” . The Security Council , this report explains , is NNP Putin ’s consultative body that works out his decisions on national security affairs and threats to the Federation and is composed of key ministers and agency heads and chaired by NNP Putin himself . Though not meant to be completely “ free of error ” , this report VBZ , the Security Council is , nevertheless , obligated to provide to NNP Putin their analysis of JJ affairs as they MD effect the national security interests of the Federation , and which the collapse of these CD nations , NNP NNPS and Saudi Arabia , poses CD of the greatest existential threats to NNP it has ever seen . Of the JJ facts involved in fearing the collapse of the NNP NNPS NN , this report VBZ , are the JJ warnings being issued in NNP today that “ internal NN is on the horizon ” and some experts RB questioning if civil NN has n’t , in fact , already begun . Leading to these fears of internal NN erupting in the , this report continues , is the complete polarization of the JJ NNS against each other driven by what a recent NN stated was due to this nation having become an oligarchy after its abandoning of democracy . With an oligarchy being a NN structure in which NN effectively rests with a JJ number of NNS , this report explains , the grave situation presently existing in the NNP NNPS is being “ ignored to their peril ” by these elites — most especially current Presidential hopeful Hillary NNP , who as the wife of a JJ NNP , NNP NNP , was a JJ US Senator and US Secretary of NNP , and was the driving force in the “ greatest gift to bankers ” ever seen in the NNP NNPS when she personally pushed through the US Congress a law forbidding , for the JJ NN in JJ history , collage students to declare bankruptcy on their student loans , which has plunged millions of them into a NN of debt servitude unable to contribute their earnings to their nations economy as all of their NN now goes to bankers . Following in Hillary NNP ’s footsteps in a “ wholesale plundering to wealth ” scheme to enrich bankers at the expense of the JJ NNS , this report continues , is NNP Obama — who in his JJ four NNS in office increased his worth 800 % from $ 1.3 CD to $ 11.8 CD and once he leaves office is estimated will be able to rake in a staggering $ 100 CD more . With an economy of a nation being more important than RB its JJ strength , this report warns , NNP Obama and the oligarchs associated with him , including the NNP and Bush dynasties , have further destroyed NNP ’s ability to make jobs — and which a recent Gallup article described grimly as : “ Simply put , startups and shootups ( JJ businesses that grow larger ) have been in a death spiral . ” RB though Obama and NNP regime supporter George Soros is warning these oligarchs of the grave NN they ’re creating , this report notes , nothing appears to be stopping these oligarchs from the pillaging of the JJ NNS — and has become so dangerous that a JJ Gallup poll showed that a staggering 75 % of the JJ NN VB corruption is “ widespread ” in their NN , not incompetence , but corruption , and that this alarming figure has held steady since 2010 , and which history has always shown no NN can survive under the weight of . As concerning to the Federation of what the collapse of the NNP NNPS MD do to the NN , this report continues , RB more so are the concerns relating to the collapse of Saudi Arabia . With RB JJ NNP Ronald Reagan top official David Stockman warning this past week that the NNP of Saud is “ a scourge on mankind that should have been eliminated decades ago ” and must be “ swept into the dustbin of history ” , SC experts in this report VBP , the collapse of this brutal oil rich monarchy MD be coming sooner than later as its economy nears total collapse and its Shiite Muslim minority is now threatening to secede and “ take all of its oil to Iran ” . The total collapse of Saudi Arabia is inevitable , this report VBZ JJ experts are warning , as this country is ugly , depressing and unappealing IN a desert slaughterhouse whose NNS are corrupt , indulgent , inbred , unintelligent , lazy , fat , cruel , inept and completely flaky and unreliable and have no skills nor work ethics . And with the NNP of Saud belonging to the most aberrant sect of Sunni Muslims VBN as Wahhabism , this report further warns , it is now becoming apparent RB to the West that the much more tolerant , and women rights supporting , Shiite Muslim peoples led by Iran are more in tune to what the NN RB is than the “ barbarian ” Sunni nations led by Saudi Arabia and their Gulf NN sycophants Bahrain , Kuwait and NNP Arab Emirates — who , unlike Shiite led Iran ( along with Shiite - led Syria and Lebanon ) , have never allowed their citizens to vote against their despotic monarchial rule . But to the greatest fears of Saudi Arabia and it Gulf NN allies , along with their Western backers , this report explains , is that RB those these nations are “ ruled for NN ” by Sunni Muslim monarchs , their oppressed Shiite citizens live on top of nearly all of the oil in the entire Middle East — and all of whom have pledged their allegiance to Iran . And instead of coming to grips with its collapse , this report warns , the Saudi NN has decided that rather than learning lessons from the hubris of its neighbours , it wo n’t wait for NN to come home — but has readily begun exporting NN in the region in its madcap bid to extend its geopolitical hegemony and prolong its petro-dominance . RB worse , this report continues , in Saudi Arabia ’s “ insane bid ” to push Iran into open conflict in the hopes that the Obama regime will bail them out through massive NN , they not only torpedoed NNP ’s entire Middle Eastern policy with their beheading of their most prominent , and peaceful , Shiite clerics , today they RB dared to bomb the Iranian embassy in Yemen . Though the Security Council has not assigned a “ percentage likelihood ” of either the NNP NNPS or Saudi Arabian governments actually collapsing this NN , this report concludes , they have advised NNP Putin that he should immediately begin preparing for it being so anyway — just in NN .

These fossils got their start when a dinosaur died in an environment that had lots of moving sediment , IN an ocean , riverbed or lake . CD such place is the benthic zone -- the deepest part of a body of NN . This sediment quickly buried the dinosaur , offering its body some protection it from decomposition . While the dinosaur 's soft parts still eventually decomposed , its hard parts -- bones , teeth and claws -- remained . But a buried bone is n't the same thing as a fossil -- to become a fossil , the bone has to become rock . The organic parts of the bone , IN NN cells , collagen ( a NN ) , and fat , eventually break down . But the inorganic parts of the bone , or the parts made from minerals IN calcium , have more staying NN . They remain after the organic materials have disappeared , creating a fragile , porous mineral in the shape of the original bone . Other minerals reinforce this bone , burning into a fossil . NN gradually makes its NN into the bone , carrying minerals IN iron and calcium carbonate picked up from the surrounding sediment . As the NN penetrates the dinosaur 's bones , some of these minerals precipitate into their microscopic pores . As this process continues , the bone becomes more and more rocklike . It 's IN filling a sponge with glue -- the sponge 's physical structure stays the same , and the pores and pockets within it fill up . The glue makes the sponge sturdier and more resistant to damage . JJ , thick bones , which have more room for mineral glue , make better fossils than JJ , JJ bones . Over the course of millions of NNS , the sediment IN these reinforced bones becomes sedimentary rock . Erosion , tides and other natural processes continue to deposit more sediment , and this sediment becomes rock , too . As RB as they can withstand the pressure from the surrounding rock , the bones remain safely hidden and preserved . After millions of NNS , some natural process , IN the gradual shifting of the NN 's NN , can reveal these layers of rock and the fossils they contain . Sedimentary rock can RB hold trace fossils , which record an organism 's behavior . Some of the most well - VBN trace fossils are trackways , or the tracks of extinct animals . These form when an animal leaves its prints in soft but sturdy soil , which creates a mold . This mold fills with sediment , and both the mold and its filling harden over millions of NNS . Forces IN erosion remove the upper layers of rock , revealing the preserved footprints underneath . Sediment can RB fill the mold and harden into a cast , or a reproduction of the NN that made the print . This can happen with other traces , too , IN burrows and tunnels . Some other trace fossils include coprolites ( fossilized dung ) tooth marks on bones or wood , and nests . Sediment can RB preserve plant NN . Plants can make impressions in hardening sediment or become petrified wood after VBG through much the same process as fossilized dinosaur bones do . This type of fossilization creates sturdy fossils , but it can only take place in specific conditions . Next , we 'll look at the other ways NN forms can be buried , encased or otherwise protected so their remains last millions of NNS ."

CAMBRIDGE , Mass . — For a veteran epidemiologist , an authority on homeland security , and a JJ NN reporter , the outbreak of the novel NN is the type of emergency they had RB anticipated . But now that it is here , the three experts VBD Friday , they still MD n’t VB but feel the monumentality of what they were watching unfold . “ It ’s the most daunting NN that we ’ve contended with in half a century or more , ” Michael Mina , an epidemiologist at Harvard ’s T.H. Chan School of NNP NNP , VBD at a panel discussion Friday at Harvard ’s Kennedy School of NNP . Helen Branswell , STAT ’s infectious diseases and JJ NN reporter , has covered emerging pathogens since the 2003 NNP outbreak . But with the JJ NN , Branswell VBD during the panel , “ It ’s bizarre but I find myself startled . Having written about the possibility of something IN this for NNS , I still find myself RB startled that it ’s happening , and I do n’t VB why that is . ” She compared the circumstances now to the summer of 2014 , when Ebola was racing through West Africa and the NN did n’t seem to have a plan to stop it . “ Except that I never worried then about Ebola spreading in the city I lived in , ” she VBD . “ It ’s JJ now . ” As the panel was occurring , the Cambridge - VBN drug NN Biogen VBD that top executives had been at a meeting at a Boston hotel last week that was RB attended by eight NNS who later tested positive for the NN , which causes a NN that authorities have named NNP - CD . The NN asked JJ employees to work from home for the next CD weeks . In introducing the Harvard panel , Mark Gearan , director of the Kennedy School ’s Institute of Politics , which hosted the event , directed students and others at Harvard to JJ travel policies the NN issued on Friday , just before the panel started . They included a ban on NN - related international travel and “ non-essential ” NN - related domestic air travel , and discourage personal international travel . “ We strongly discourage any non-essential meetings or events of 100 NNS or more , ” the email to the campus read . ( Institute of Politics staff members RB put more than the usual NN between chairs in the audience . ) Panel moderator Rick Berke , STAT ’s executive editor , asked the crowd of roughly 100 NNS if any of them had considered not coming to the event . A few raised their hands . “ Do I VB that this is a bad idea ? ” Mina VBD when asked if the panel should be held . “ I VBP we ’re hitting the NN in the course of this epidemic where we might consider that this should be CD of the last types of events IN this . ” Here are some highlights from the event . Why this NN is JJ The spread of the JJ NN has been compared to influenza , which RB causes a respiratory illness . But , as the panelists pointed out , there are no drugs or NNS yet for treating or preventing the NN , VBN as NNP - NNP - 2 , as there are for NN . In addition , we are exposed to JJ NN strains throughout our lives , which VBP us build immunity . No NN had immunity to this JJ NN . “ We have an entirely susceptible population , ” Mina VBD . “ The potential for this to burn through a population very quickly is very high without extraordinary measures . ” As researchers race to VB the NN , they are finding that it does not seem to be infecting great numbers of NNS , or at least making them very sick . ( Experts IN the globe are still trying to figure out just how broadly the infection has spread , given that JJ mild NNS are likely to be missed . ) But it is causing serious harm to older NNS and those with underlying diseases or weakened NN systems . “ This NN , on the CD hand , there ’s a saving grace that it does n’t seem to be impacting our young , and that is amazing , ” Mina VBD . “ But the mortality rate among NNS who are getting infected above 80 NNS old is 15 - plus % . ” How to mentally prepare for this NN If you plan for the disruptions that the response to the NN MD require , it will seem less unexpected when schools are canceled or you ’re VBN to work from home , advised panelist Juliette Kayyem , the faculty chair of the Kennedy School ’s homeland security program and a JJ homeland security official at the NN and federal level . “ VB your head IN this is practical , ” she VBD . “ It ’s here , there are VBG to be massive disruptions to our JJ fabric in terms of your day to day . All of you have a part in stopping the spread of this … but we have to treat this as part of the plan . We ’re at that stage now . ” Unlike with a natural disaster or terrorist attack , “ we do n’t have a boom moment , ” she VBD , and the NN was more slow rolling . “ When do you activate ? ” she VBD . “ That ’s sort of the challenge RB now . ” Kayyem , who worked in the Obama administration , RB made the point that the response will be a patchwork . Some schools will close , others will remain open . The federal NN ’s bungled rollout of testing for NNP - NNP - 2 , which has limited how JJ NNS can VB tested for the NN but is now being remedied , did not inspire much confidence in the U.S. response initially . But Kayyem VBD that as NNS are detected in more places , it will largely be on local and NN agencies . She described the NN as “ locally executed , NN managed , and federally supported . ” As for how to judge whether the response is working : “ The bad thing has happened , it ’s coming , it ’s here , ” she VBD . “ We ’re in the response phase . Our measure of success is not containment anymore . Our measure of success now is , will fewer NNS die or VB severely sick because of our efforts ? ” It ’s not just the NN that has a role to play , she VBD . Universities , the NN , and employers VBP to act responsibly . Individuals RB have to VB involved , whether it ’s staying home if they are not feeling well or making sure they have had the NN shot . After all , if they can avoid getting the NN , that frees up NN for NN care providers to deal with NNP - CD NNS . Mina VBD the fragmented U.S. NN care NN leaves him worried about the cohesion of a response . “ I do n’t VB to sound defeatist here , but the NN of our NN care NN , the NN we have privatized everything about it for the most part , is VBG to seriously impact our ability , ” he VBD , adding that , “ we have no ability to create out of the blue JJ hospital beds . We ca n’t RB test appropriately . ” “ If we ca n’t figure how to run some PCR instruments because we can’t work together as a society — this is within networks , within hospitals , within the national NN , everything — I RB am very concerned about this in a NN that far exceeds our concerns for other viruses and other pathogens , and the most vulnerable are the elderly . ” The response in NNP , where the NN RB emerged and NNS quickly exploded , included the unprecedented steps of essentially quarantining tens of millions of NNS in and IN Wuhan , the city at the center of the outbreak . There were concerns about NNS with other diseases being able to VB the care they needed and the trampling of individual liberty . But from a raw epidemiological perspective , JJ NN authorities have argued that such drastic measures gave the NN more NN to prepare . The interventions in NNP , they VBP , delayed the wave of NNS in other places IN the NN . “ I VBP it was absolutely the JJ thing , ” Mina VBD . “ They truly bought the rest of the NN at least a month . The U.S. wasted it , in my opinion , but JJ NNS did not . ” Kayyem agreed about the initial U.S. response . “ When the story is written about U.S. preparedness for this , Chapter 1 will be called ‘ Squandered NNP . ’ Not just on the JJ side , but on the preparedness side , ” she VBD . “ What were we doing ? And now , how do we make up for lost NN ? It ’s not just the kits . It ’s why this week we seemed so JJ - footed and surprised by things IN school closings . School closings were inevitable the second we had the JJ patients . ” Where this MD VB from here Branswell noted that some NNS , VBN on both biology and socioeconomics , will be able to VB the outbreak more safely and less disruptively than others . “ I ’m very worried RB now about vulnerable populations , ” she VBD . “ I ’m RB concerned about NNS living in JJ - term care facilities . If this NN gets into JJ - term care facilities [ as it has in the Seattle area ] , it will be RB bad . I ’m worried about NNS who stay in homeless shelters . I ’m worried about NNS who work in retail . I ’m worried about NNS who do n’t have the NN to stockpile food because they do n’t have extra NN . I ’m worried about the fact that there is n’t much JJ cohesion RB now . NNS seem to be RB angry at each other a lot and this is a NN when we ’re RB VBG to VB to VB each other . ” Kayyem VBD that organizers of JJ events , including the presidential nominating conventions and the Olympics , VBP to start coming up with Plan Bs . The decisions about whether to actually VB with these alternate plans ca n’t be made yet , but it is crucial to start developing contingencies . “ I can not tell you when we ’re VBG to activate and when it ’s VBG to impact , but if the parties are not thinking about how you pick your nominee in a JJ manner , shame on them , ” she VBD about the conventions . “ We do n’t VB where we will be at that moment , ” she added . “ I VBP we VBP to be comfortable making decisions in week allotments . ” After the event , Harvard officials VBD they were considering cancelling a full roster of Kennedy School Forums for next week , making Friday ’s potentially their last JJ event at the Kennedy School for quite a while .

It became a major story and RB NBA Commissioner Adam Silver — who , IN Irving , went to Duke — was asked to offer his opinion . “ Kyrie and I went to the same college , ” Silver VBD then . “ He MD have taken some JJ courses . ” Irving indicated in the days and months that followed the podcast that he initially made the remarks to promote conversation and prove a point how stories in this JJ - NN age can spread rapidly .

In June 1936 Max Hahn and his wife Emma were on a walk beside a waterfall near to London , Texas , when they noticed a rock with wood protruding from its core . They decided to take the oddity home and later cracked it open with a hammer and a chisel . What they VBD within shocked the archaeological and scientific community . Embedded in the rock was what appeared to be some type of ancient NN made hammer . A team of archaeologists analysed and dated it . The rock encasing the hammer was dated to more than 400 CD NNS old . The hammer itself turned out to be more than 500 CD NNS old . Additionally , a section of the wooden handle had begun the metamorphosis into coal . The hammer ’s head , made of more than 96 % iron , is far more pure than anything nature MD have achieved without assistance from relatively modern smelting methods . In 1889 near Nampa , Idaho , whilst workers were boring an artesian well , a JJ figurine made of baked clay was extracted from a depth of 320 NNS . To reach this depth the workers had to cut through fifteen NNS of basalt lava and JJ other strata below that . That in itself does not seem remarkable , until PRP considers that the very top layer of lava has been dated to at least 15 CD NNS old ! It is currently accepted by NN and geology that coal is a by - product of decaying vegetation . The vegetation becomes buried over NN and is covered with sediment . That sediment eventually fossilises and becomes rock . This natural process of coal formation takes up to 400 CD NNS to accomplish . Anything that is VBN in lumps of coal or in coal seams during mining , had to have been placed or dropped into the vegetation before it was buried in sediment . In 1944 , as a ten NN old boy , Newton Anderson , dropped a lump of coal in his basement and it broke in half as it hit the floor . What he discovered inside defies explanation VBN upon current scientific orthodoxy . Inside the coal was a hand crafted brass alloy bell with an iron clapper and sculptured handle . When an analysis was carried out it was discovered that the bell was made from anunusual mix of metals , JJ from any VBN modern alloy production ( including copper , zinc , tin , arsenic , iodine , and selenium ) . The seam from whence this lump of coal was mined is estimated to be 300,000,000 NNS old ! A hand crafted bell VBN in a 300 CD NN old lump of coal ! These extraordinary discoveries although bizarre , are not unique or RB uncommon . There are literally thousands of them collecting dust , locked away from JJ scrutiny in the vaults of museums throughout the NN . There are JJ other unusual reported finds including the following : The Morrisonville , Illinois Times , on June 11 , 1891 , reported how Mrs. S. W. Culp VBD a circular shaped eight - carat gold chain , about CD inches JJ , embedded in a lump of coal after she broke it apart to put in her scuttle . The chain was described as “ antique ” and of “ quaint workmanship . ” Displayed in a museum at Glen Rose , Texas , is a cast iron pot reportedly VBN in a JJ lump of coal in 1912 by a worker feeding coal into the furnace of a NN plant . When he split open the coal the worker VBD the pot fell out , leaving its impression in the coal . Yet another report VBN in the Epoch Times VBD of a Colorado rancher who in the 1800 ’s broke open a lump of coal , dug from a vein some 300 NNS below the NN , and discovered a “ strange - looking iron thimble . ” The Salzburg Cube is yet another ancient puzzle VBN by a worker named Reidl , in an Austrian foundry in 1885 . IN the others , this NN broke open a block of coal and VBD a metal cube embedded inside . Recent analysis established the object was of forged iron and obviously hand crafted . The coal it was VBN in was millions of NNS old . The list of such items goes on and on and on . Welcome to the NN of Ooparts , or Out of Place Artefacts . Out of place artefacts ( Ooparts ) are so named because conventional scientific wisdom ( an oxymoron if ever there was CD ) VBZ that these artefacts should n’t exist VBN upon currently accepted beliefs regarding our origins and history . These discoveries are “ out of place ” in the orthodox timeline of JJ history . The usual methods of the conformist scientific community , when faced with such anomalies is to attempt to debunk their reported age , or perhaps endeavour to discredit the source of the report or RB the reporter . If this approach fails then usually the artefacts themselves are banished to the shadowy vaults of museums and warehouses , never to be seen again . If these unusual artefacts were “ CD offs ” then perhaps PRP MD be forgiven for accepting the view espoused by the mainstream scientific and archaeological community that they are hoaxes or misreported stories . However , when PRP realises that thousands upon thousands of these anomalous artefacts have been discovered and reported over the NNS , then PRP MD VB to re-evaluate ones acceptance of the integrity of mainstream archaeology and NN . Occasionally an honest archaeologist will attempt to reveal to the NN the JJ age and origin of such anomalous objects . They will question the accepted beliefs of their mainstream peers . They usually find that their career ends quite abruptly . Unfortunately , the majority just accept what they are taught in school and NN without question . That is how our educational NN is designed . It does not encourage individuality and originality . It purely indoctrinates CD with established beliefs and dogma . If PRP requires NN of this “ mainstream ” mentality , CD NN look no further than the realms of psychiatry . Modern psychiatry seeks to demonize and declare mentally ill anyone who deviates from what is regarded as the norm . These so called “ mental NN professionals ” have RB invented a JJ mental disorder named Oppositional Defiant Disorder , or ODD ( love the irony of the abbreviation ) . This newly invented condition is listed in the latest instalment of the industry ’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , or DSM , which dubs NNS who do not conform to what those in charge declare to be normal , as mentally insane . So there you have your proof – I ’m obviously an unmitigated nutter and completely insane . At least that is what those in authority MD VB everyone to VB ! On CD side of the field we have the Darwinists and their NN of evolution , trying to establish the extremely flawed view that we have somehow evolved into highly intelligent sentient beings from a primordial blob of gunge , miraculously brought to NN by an electrical storm billions of NNS ago . ( Perhaps CD of this cults followers MD explain to me when “ consciousness ” evolved , and provide proof – I await with baited breath ! ) On the other side we have the creationists with the belief that some omnipotent invisible being who lives in the clouds , waved his magic wand about 7,000 NNS ago and created the NN and everything on it . Again the adherents of this equally flawed NN rely on nothing more than a book called the Bible for their “ proof ” of this concept . The fact that this book has been bastardised during translation numerous times during its existence , has been re-written to certain individuals personal preference on a number of occasions , and has had JJ complete chapters omitted , is irrelevant to its followers . All they require is “ faith ” . Proof and NN is not a prerequisite ! PRP MD n’t VB more opposing beliefs if CD tried , and both camps adhere to their beliefs voraciously , and with unshakable fervour . Yet neither are VBN on any kind of factual or hard NN . The reality is that the origin of the JJ race is a total enigma . No NN , anywhere , actually knows how old humanity is or how and where it originated . It is a complete mystery . Yet from birth CD is indoctrinated into CD or the other of the above factions , with no questions asked or alternative opinions allowed . The problem the mainstream has with these anomalous Ooparts is that they throw into question every single established belief there is regarding our past . It seems that everywhere we look , we find things that contradict much of the scientific orthodoxy of today . The scientific establishment will never acknowledge or admit that these artefacts are authentic . To do so MD be to admit that they are completely wrong about our origins , and consequently , invalidate all of the text books VBN to indoctrinate us and our NNS . The discovery of Ooparts completely annihilates the [ comparatively recent ] NN of evolution . If , as this hypothesis MD have us VB , modern NNS only evolved 200,000 NNS ago ( or thereabouts ) , PRP has to ask how NN made artefacts , VBN in substrata originating millions of NNS ago , MD be explained ? Alternatively , the advocates of creationism have a very quaint NN of “ acknowledging ” the existence of Ooparts , and bizarrely , actually VBP that Ooparts substantiate their NN view . Creationists just completely disregard the established dating methods , and declare every single recognized archaeological and geological process null and void . They MD have us all VB that coal seams , rock strata , fossils , minerals , precious stones and every other antediluvian element , took only a few thousand NNS to form . Yet the psychiatric establishment MD have me labelled as the loony for questioning this baloney . VB figure ! There will no doubt be readers who , similar to predictable conservative archaeologists , and probably due to their indoctrinated belief NN , will RB dismiss the aforementioned Ooparts as hoaxes or forgeries . Perhaps they MD VB to consider and offer an explanation for the following . It is an accepted belief that NNS and dinosaurs did not co-exist . According to conventional academia , dinosaurs roamed the NN between 65 and 225 CD NNS ago , whereas the earliest upright biped humanoid , homo erectus , only appeared about 1.8 CD NNS ago . However , in 1968 a palaeontologist named Stan Taylor began excavations of fossilised dinosaur footprints , discovered in the bed of the Paluxy river near Glen Rose , Texas . What he unearthed shocked and dumbfounded the scientific community . Alongside the dinosaur tracks , in exactly the same cretaceous fossilised strata , were well preserved JJ footprints . The immediate reaction of evolutionists , archaeologists , and NN in general , was to debunk the find as a hoax . “ They were carved into the rock by hoaxers ” or “ They are not JJ footprints , but more dinosaur footprints that have been eroded to look JJ ” were the arguments most commonly proposed . However , their line of reasoning falls somewhat JJ when PRP asks why only the JJ prints were eroded and not RB the 3 toed dinosaur prints ? Additionally PRP has to consider , if the JJ prints were carved as a hoax , how did the hoaxers manage to carve further JJ footprints that continued under bedrock that was later removed from the side of the river bed ? Since the initial discovery , hundreds more JJ footprints have been discovered and unearthed , both in Paluxy and in JJ other places IN the globe . Either those hoaxers have unlimited NN and budget – or someone is telling porkies ! Next NN needs to consider another find discovered in 100 CD NN old cretaceous limestone . A fossilised JJ finger , which was VBN along with a childs tooth and JJ hair . This finger has been subjected to numerous scientific tests and analysis . Sectioning revealed the typical porous bone structure expected in a JJ finger . Additionally a Cat-scan and MRI scan identified joints and traced tendons throughout the length of the fossil . This is CD find that NN cannot explain away as a hoax . at - scan of a JJ fossilised finger shows dark areas showing the interior of bones and bone marrow , along with tendons . There is however another find of recent NNS that blows all of the others into a cocked hat regarding age . Over the past few decades , miners near the little town of Ottosdal in Western Transvaal , South Africa , have been digging up hundreds of mysterious metal spheres . These spheres measure between 25 and 100 mm in diameter , and some are etched with three parallel grooves running completely IN the equator . CD types of spheres have been VBN . CD is composed of a solid bluish metal with flecks of white , the other is hollowed out and filled with a spongy white substance . These spheres are reportedly so delicately balanced that RB with modern technology , they MD VB to be made in a zero gravity environment to attain these characteristics . These objects have become VBN as the Klerksdorp spheres . Geologists have attempted to debunk these artefacts as natural formations or “ limonite concretions ” . They fail to explain sufficiently how these formations occurred naturally with perfectly straight and perfectly spaced grooves IN the centres . Perhaps the real reason for such fervent attempted debunking by the scientific community , is that the rock in which these spheres where VBN is Precambrian – and dated to 2.8 CD NNS old ! Whether PRP wishes to accept these out of place artefacts as genuine or not is I suppose , down to personal beliefs . Evolutionists refuse to accept them as to do so MD mean re-evaluating their whole indoctrinated belief NN . They will RB stoop to producing outright fantasy in their attempts to discredit these discoveries . If that fails then they will just pretend that they do not exist , and then hide them away – forever . Creationists on the other hand willingly accept them as some bizarre kind of proof that the universe is only about 7,000 NNS old , and totally ignore any NN , from any source , to the contrary . They continue to cling to a medieval belief NN VBN purely on blind faith . How quaint . Personally , I do n’t belong to either camp . I keep an open NN regarding our origins . I do n’t have any particular “ philosophy ” on the subject but rather prefer to adapt my understanding as JJ NN becomes available . My only current belief VBN upon all of the available facts to date is that the JJ race has inhabited this NN for millions of NNS longer than is presently accepted . I realise that I will never discover the answer to the question of our origin . The JJ race has been searching for this answer since the dawn of NN , and it still evades us . Everything we have been taught in our schools and universities about our origin and history , is VBN upon nothing more than speculation and hypothesis . There is not a single provable fact out there that conclusively answers the question “ where do we come from ” What I will continue to do however is question everything , and not just blindly accept any mainstream viewpoint because it happens to be fashionable at the NN . If that means CD day I VBP a knock at my door from men in white coats holding a straight jacket , then so be it ……"

As funny and unbelievable as this is , he 's not the only NBA star that has made recent comments about the NNP being JJ , which appears to be a growing sentiment in the NBA . During the podcast , Shaquille O’Neal claimed the NNP is JJ because he 's driven JJ times from coast to coast and it seems JJ to him while driving . The full extent of his nonsensical reasoning is below , which was promoted in response to Kyrie Irving insisting he believes the NNP is JJ . “ It ’s JJ . The NNP is JJ . The NNP is JJ . Yes , it is . Listen , there are three ways to manipulate the NN — what you read , what you VBP and what you hear . In school , JJ thing they teach us is , ‘ Oh , Columbus discovered NNP , ’ but when he got there , there were some fair - skinned NNS with the JJ hair smoking on the peace pipes . So , what does that tell you ? Columbus did n’t discover NNP . So , listen , I drive from coast to coast , and this s*** is JJ to me . I ’m just saying . I drive from Florida to California all the NN , and it ’s JJ to me . I do not VB up and down at a 360 - degree angle , and all that stuff about gravity , have you looked outside Atlanta lately and seen all these buildings ? You mean to tell me that NNP is under us ? NNP is under us ? It ’s not . The NN is JJ . ” Hopefully Shaq is joking and does n't honestly VB the NNP is JJ . However , when CD of his co-hosts injected some reason that we have satellite imagery from NN that shows the NNP is round Shaq responded with "" Oh satellite imagery ? That MD be [ a ] drone or made up . "" He followed it up insisting that it's JJ “ I ’m just saying that when I drive from Florida to NNP NNP – JJ . NNP NNP to Seattle – JJ . Seattle to LA – JJ . ” These comments are on the back of several high - profile NBA players insisting the NNP is JJ from their views . Kyrie Irving , a Cleveland Cavaliers ' player , stated that he believes the NNP is JJ , adding that “ I ’ve seen a lot of things that my educational NN has VBN that was real that turned out to be completely JJ . "" The JJ NNP claim by Kyrie was further backed by Draymond Green of the Golden NNP Warriors and Wilson Chandler of the Denver Nuggets who claimed NNP 's photos of NNP from NN MD have been easily be altered VBG a smartphone . It is entirely possible that some or all of the aforementioned NBA stars do not actually VB the NNP is JJ and are simply joking . Ultimately , it does n't entirely matter whether they are serious or joking because the perception and reaction has been the same . The harm is when role models openly oppose basic fundamentals of NN without any NNS backing it . Hopefully those that look up to these players realize that a belief in NN underpins every piece of their daily NN from transportation to JJ advances and smartphones . Shaq has built up quite a resume , 15 NN NBA All - star , 7th place in all - NN points scored , 3 NN NBA All Star Game MVP , and has RB earned a doctorate .

As they drew near , five or six strong , tramping heavily through the turnips , I was struck by the apparent tremor of the NN beneath me . It was shivering IN a jelly — or I was ; for a moment I was in doubt which . Spreading out my hands upon the NN and lying as dose and JJ as I MD , l was soon made sure that the tremor was RB in the NN and not in me . It grew more and more distinct , keeping NN with the tramp of the walkers . When at last they reached me I VBD them of their Neptunian feat , and , them jump altogether a few yards off , was gratified to find that I MD thus bring about a. very respectable earthquake at will . The motion was very peculiar , and I can well VB that a queasier stomach than mine MD soon be conscious of something very IN a ^l de terre . We examined the structure of this skipping hill , hut VBD nothing that helped us much to an explanation . It was mainly made up of a thick cap of gravel on a base of red sandstone , and so was not likely to contain anything IN a high - arched hollow or concealed morass within . This vivid little experience made me readier , perhaps , than some to accept the striking statements about NN shaking made by the brothers Darwin at the NNP meeting of the British Association . Especially was I prepared to give credit to what they quoted from the Astronomer Royal about Greenwich Hill and the Observatory . He wrote : ” In the old times of Greenwich Fair , some twenty NNS ago , when crowds of NNS VBD to run down the hill , I find the observers MD not take reflection observations for CD or three hours after the crowd had been turned out . . . . We do not have anything IN such crowds now , RB on bank holidays , and 1 have not heard lateiy of any interference with tile observations . ” ' ' There is as little foundation for the calumnious hypothesis that the observers whose reflections were thus agitated had been visiting the fair themselves as for the suggestion that the above experience of my own took place after luncheon . No . the truth is the solid NN is a very elastic solid after all , and Greenwich HiU and the Observatory and all that it contained were trembling IN my Highland knoll . The hOWdah of the Atlas elephant that stands on a tortoise , is a rather rickety structure , and quakes with every jog of the Titanic beast . But is it not being tugged at by every petty planetoid , pulled from its path by every NN , heaved all awry through its yielding bulk by NN and NN in their courses ? It is ; but over and above these longer , graver motions there are incessant tremblings and quiverings in quick periods , measured by seconds or less . This unlooked for sensitiveness to JJ stresses , this incessant vibration when all obvious disturbing causes are eliminated , are the JJ facts that the Darwins have so strikingly brought out . How solid rock and massive piers of stone warp under heat and cold IN unseasoned wood ; how a wide stretch of ground MD swey and rise for hours together after a little NN has been poured on it ; how the passage of a train VBZ away or the pressing of a finger on the ground near at hand MD be enough to deflect the plumb line to a visible degree — these and JJ other JJ phenomena are detailed in the full and most interesting preliminary report on the Lunar Disturbance of Gravity , handed in to the Section of Physics by the ingenious brothers . The title reminds us that , as so often in NN . it was in looking for CD thing that they VBD another . Every CD knows that as the NN pulls the NN round in its monthly orbit , so , too , the NN . pulls the NN and everything upon it . If a plummet be hung up RB under the NN , so to speak , the NN is drawing the bob downward , the NN very much more feebly pulls it upward . The result is that the bob weighs a trifle lighter than if the NN were abolished . Thanks to the NN , the string is leM severely strained . If the NN be not RB overhead , but down a little toward its rising or its setting point , the bob will be a little drawn aside out of the straight and the plummet will no longer give a JJ plumb line . As the NN rises , crosses the sky , and sets , then the direction of the plumb line will VB through a JJ angle . Of course , RB when no NN is seen , its silent influence must be felt , and the plumb line will return to its position by the NN the NN is ready to rise again . How JJ the NN RB is we MD gather from the fact that with a plummet three hundred yards RB , the travel to and fro of the bob MD scarcely II this country reach a thousandth of an inch . This is what is meant by the lunar disturbance of the direction of gravity : and there must , of course , be a solar disturbance RB , the same in kind , but naturally very much smaller in amount . To investigate these disturbances experimentally clearly calls for refined skill and very delicate apparatus ; but Sir William Thomson , to whom instrumental difficulties are always but NN 's play , in suggesting the investigation three NNS ago , had in view the detection of an influence still more recondite and refined . I have VBN that the NN , in pulling aside the bob of the plummet , pulls RB on the NN beneath it . If the NN were perfectly stiff and unyielding , this pull MD have no effect on the deflection of the plumb line . But if , as we have reason to VB , the NN yields IN a great viscous mass to great stresses as well as to JJ ones , a hump of solid NN — a land tide — will travel round the globe in obedience to the NN 's attraction . This hump in its course will pass under the suspended plummet , and the actual deflections of the plumb line as observed will no longer agree with those reckoned on the supposition that the NN is rigid . If we had an instrument , then , by which the minute aberrations of a carefully suspended pendulum , isolated as far as possible from all local disturbance , MD be magnified up to the point of visibility , we should have it in our NN • “ On an Instrument for Detecting and 'Measuring flmall NNS in the Direction of Gravity . ” By George H. Darwin . M.A. , F.B S. , late Fellow of Trinity College , Cambridge , and Horace Darwin , M.A. , A.M.I.l:.lS. British Association Report . 1881 .to settle some very pretty points in the physical NN of the NN . Such an instrument , after various trials and fail - ures . the Darwins have erected in the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge . A massive stoue , weighing three - quarters of a ton , is bedded in a pit upon the native gravel . It is surrounded by a trench , a NN wide , to isolate it completely from the floor and the building . The pendulum is a massive cylinder of pure copper , hung by a brass wire about a yard RB . inside a hoRow cylindrical copper support that rises from the stone . A tiny galvanometer mirror is hung by CD fine threads , CD of which is fastened to the bob and the other to a projection of the fixed support . This suspension is so arranged that any movement of the hob displaces the mirror to a much greater degree . A ray of light is sent from a distant lamp on to the mirror , and thence reflected to a scale seven NNS away . The magnification resulting from this double process is something IN 50,010 times . To still and quench accidental tremors , the hollow copper cylinder is filled up with a mixture of spirits and NN . It is a fact , ^^e out hy Poiseuille , that a boiled mixture of ginand NN is much more viscous and clogs the motions of bodies immersed in it much more effectually than either the neat gin or the simple NN . Further to ward off the effect ' of external NNS of NN , the whole instrument is immersed in a tank of NN resting on the stone ; and lastly , after the precedent of the Tisbbite , tile surrounding trencb is RB filled up with NN . Thus protected , tbe apparatus might seem sufficiently cut off from local influences , but as a fact its sensitiveness is now so great that tbe observation has to he carried on in another room by means of a window and a telescope . Standing in the room itself sixteen NNS away , it is enough to shih youi ' weight from CD NN to the other to VB the speck of ligbt to run along the scale . The same result follows if you pre^ steadily with your fingers on the stone edge of the trench , but you MD strike a good sharp blow RB on the stone base without effect . It is the distor - sion of the soil by slight steady pressure that is transmitted through solid gravel aud stone and shows itself as a microscopic deviation of the pendulum . Such being the NN , the instrument should he deiicate enough , in all conscience , to determine lunar and RB solar disturbances in the direction of gravity ; but , unfortunately , having got so far , we seem almost to have done too much . When regular series of observations are made it is VBN that the pendulum is hardly ever steady . The image on the seale dances about inceiMantly . The ground is never RB still . Some days it MD bequieter than others , and generally there is NN of distinct diurnal periods , but the minor zigzags constantly interrupt and at times reverse for an hour together the slower march northward or southward . These tremors have been hitherto so persistent and so wildly irregular that for the present , at least , the prospect of unraveling from them the perturbations due to the NN does not seem very near . Mr. George Darwin talks of the probable necessity of building a gravitation observatory at the bottom of a mine . There , it MD be hoped , the rail NN train and the NN cart will cease from troubling , and the plummet , save for Ihe steady paces of the NN , will be at rest . The work of examining and observing these tremors of the NN is , however , still VBG on at Cambridge , and idrcady several sharp seasons of microscopic earthquake , unsuspected outside , have been noted . Sometimes a very storm of tremor breaks out for which no sufficient local NN can be traced - . RB so far , the outcome of these experiments MD prove of high value to practical astronomers . The piers on which their great telescopes turn are built of solid stone , hitherto regarded as the material most insusceptible to NN or disturbance . The Darwins have shown that such piers are RB most sensitive to inequalities of NN and to JJ stresses . They yield and warp to a most unexpected degree . Tbeir had conducting NN is responsible for this in part , and it is fruitfully suggested that it might be well to plate the piers with coppenand to swathe them wi*h flannel . Astronomers , who , to their vexation . have to redetermine the level of their instruments from hour to hour , and who have RB suspected the occurrence of microscopic earthquakes , will take note of this practical hint .. They will make ready use , too , of the observation here recorded as to the effect of the observer 's own weigbt . They will VB more of the drainage of the soil IN their instruments after the observation on the irregular and JJ - continued swelling of ' the ground that results from the percolation of NN . Meanwhile the British Association and Cambridge MD be congratulated ( in the JJ and valuable , field of work thus opened out under their au. ; pices , and especially on their having enlisted the services and energies of CD workers who so worthily keep up the tradition of an honored name . — London Times ."

It has VBN its NN into the headlines of The Boston Globe ( “ Vote all you VBP . The secret NN wo n’t VB “ ) and the NNP NNP Times ( “ NNP ’s ‘ Establishment ’ Has Embraced ‘ Deep NNPS ’ “ ) . Heck , it has RB been talked about on the NNP Bank ’s blog . This onslaught of attention begs the question : why now ? Why are so JJ mainstream outlets suddenly shining a light on something that has barely been acknowledged in the past ? To be sure , some of this recent coverage is a whitewash , as you MD expect . The NNP Bank blog , for instance , pawns the concept off as something to be VBN in “ newish democracies ” in “ Latin NNP , Africa , Asia , Eastern Europe and so on , ” i.e. , not in the West . This qualification –that the “ deep NN ” idea is something only to be VBN in foreign , backwards polities –harkens back to the origins of the phrase . The term “ deep NN ” itself is a translation of a Turkish phrase , derin devlet , that rose to prominence after the Susurluk incident exposed the Turkish secret NN and its NATO / Gladio / drug running / terrorist associations . It has become increasingly allowable for opinion makers in the MSM to cite the Turkish or the Egyptian “ deep NN ” as a real phenomenon ( or at least a real possibility ) while simultaneously deriding the possibility that it exists in the West . However in recent NNS researchers IN Peter Dale Scott have developed and expanded the concept to explain how Western JJ institutions function . This seems to have been picked up by NNS IN Mike Lofgren , a retired Congressional staffer who has described how the JJ deep NN involves a cross-party consensus on key JJ issues , or Philip Giraldi , the JJ intelligence agent whose recent musings on the JJ deep NN received copious attention from the mainstream press . CD NN to look at this development is as an extension of a phenomenon that I noted several NNS ago : a process of indoctrination that has begun to inform the NN that there is a shadowy elite in NN of the NN stage and prepare them to accept that fact . Nearly a decade ago Kissinger mini-me David Rothkopf came out with his book “ Superclass ” revealing the group of 6,000 or so non-state actors with the ability to enact policies and further agendas across NN lines . Since that NN a remarkable number of conspiracies - that - dare - not - be- mentioned from the CFR to the Bilderberg Group to the Bohemian Grove are now banal JJ talking points . Whereas mainstream radio hosts once played Twilight Zone music when callers tried to discuss the CFR , now Hillary NNP blithely admits that the NNP Department receives marching orders from them ; whereas the Bilderberg Group was once subject to a complete NN blackout , it now has its own website and press releases . But again : why now ? Partly this has to be due to the fact that in the post - 9/11 , post - Iraq , post - bailout , post - Hope and NNP NN , it has become impossible to maintain the illusion that it is the JJ front men who are running the show . No NN believes this lie anymore , and it shows . RB scientific studies are now demonstrating that the NNP NNPS is not run by JJ parties but by pockets of special interest . Truly the NN toothpaste is out of the tube and there ’s no point in trying to put it back . While in JJ ways this represents the crowning achievement of the tireless efforts of generations of NN researchers who have toiled in relative obscurity , it is not an unmitigated good . As we will VB in the CD prospective this weekend , the revelation of the ruling elite coincides with a meltdown of JJ cohesion that is giving rise to dark forces that portend a very tumultuous NN . In the meantime , I ’m interested in your thoughts on this subject . Why do you VB the “ deep NN ” idea is being taken up in the mainstream now ? Do you VB there is a strategy to these revelations or is it a rearguard effort to whitewash the undeniable ? Corbett Report members are invited to leave your comments below ."

Read_VB the_DT original_JJ article_NN ._.","The following essay is reprinted with permission from The Conversation , an JJ publication covering the latest research . Ancient and quaint seem the days of witch crazes , demon scares and tulip manias . Instances of mass hysteria MD strike you as rare events in modern advanced societies . But such outbreaks are NNS of their times . They ’re still RB today , just in JJ guises . Aided and abetted by its status as an internet meme , the myth of an evil , supernatural Slenderman has been panicking adolescents since 2009 , RB culminating in an attempted murder by proxy . If it ’s easy to brush this off as a NN of impressionable teens with too much internet access , then what of otherwise rational late 20th - century JJ adults participating in suicide cults , Puerto Rico ’s mythical cattle - killing Chupacabra monster , the “ irrational exuberance ” of the dot - com bubble in the 1990s , or the seemingly insane rush to make bad real estate investments in the latter 2000s ? As this article is being written , the U.S. is embroiled in a diplomatic dustup with Cuba that has all the classic NNS of a collective delusion . The U.S. NNP Department claims its diplomats in Havana were subjected to “ sonic attacks ” that produced a range of physical NNS including hearing loss , headaches and dizziness . Consequently , the NNP Department pulled out most of its embassy staff and sent packing most Cuban diplomats stationed in the U.S. Although post - hoc JJ exams have identified unusual physical conditions in some diplomats , there is still no direct NN tying them to the alleged sonic attacks . Moreover , the JJ timing , logistical demands and absence of a plausible technology put the likelihood of the attacks at virtually zero . So how do otherwise logical and informed 21st - century NNS fall under the spell of these mass delusions ? Over the past several decades , psychologists and sociologists have VBN examples IN these to dig into when and how this kind of JJ belief gains traction . Collective delusions are the culprits behind mass hysterias and related phenomena . As traditionally defined , they ’re characterized by a rapid , spontaneous and temporary spread of JJ beliefs within a circumscribed population . Nowadays that circumscribed population can be a virtual NN , bounded only by cyberconnections to a shared source of misinformation . The recent upsurge in vocal JJ - NNP proponents , for example , is not the result of geographical neighbors whipping each other into a near frenzy . JJ NN makes it easy to find IN - minded others , serve distorted NN to the curious , and stir up excitement about events such as the 2017 eclipse , celebrity endorsements , and a proposed rocket launch by a JJ - NNP proponent intended to prove once and for all that we are all living on a disc . Collective delusions emerge under a combination of several conditions . Each of these precursors is straightforward enough , but it ’s harder to foresee when they might occur in concert . In turn , this makes predicting delusional outbreaks a very inexact NN . The most obvious precursor is the presence of multiple NNS who are sufficiently connected so as to share NN or experiences . Second , just as an isolated individual MD develop some beliefs and behaviors that depart from prevailing norms , collective delusions and responses are more likely to occur in relatively insular groups or networks . Third , a collective delusion is more likely to take hold if the group is undergoing some kind of distress . This MD be rising unemployment , JJ destabilization or an enemy ’s threats of warfare . On a smaller scale , a town MD lose a crucial employer , or a fire - and - brimstone minister can instigate a satanic panic with rumors of baby - killing cults . And fourth , the stressors are potent enough to trigger , in at least some individuals , either a psychosomatic response or scapegoating behavior . Psychosomatic reactions — physical NNS with psychological causes — MD be as mild as itching or as severe as blindness . Scapegoating involves blaming a group of innocent ( or possibly nonexistent ) others for causing problems — psychosomatic or otherwise . When conditions are ripe , this catalyzing subset of group members sets off a chain reaction . They begin to seek and identify external causes for their distress , or sources for its relief . Psychosomatic responses spread ; contempt for the scapegoats grows . NNS become hypervigilant and toss critical thinking out the window , looking for and finding imagined threats . NN NNS are spawned , angels and demons invoked , fears stoked , panic induced . The supernatural MD start to seem natural . As more and more group members become ensnared in a positive feedback loop , the perceived threat is legitimized , only broadening and deepening JJ distress further . Because they are inherently newsworthy , mass delusions are picked up by mass NN which fan the flames RB more . In these ways , a nonexistent threat can set off a self - sustaining cascade of irrationality that lasts until the perceived threat recedes . Delusion everywhere , to JJ degrees ? While descriptions of mass hysterias make great reading , they represent only the far end of a continuum of what sociologists VBP me call JJ diffusion processes . For the most part , these are quite mundane — you might recognize a few from your own daily NN . While IN the NN NN NN bubbles and bank runs make NN , less frenetic responses to perceived threats and conspiracies abound : the 9/11 “ truthers , ” the recent uptick in JJ - NNP beliefs , fears of gluten and genetically modified foods , NN NN deniers , wars on NN on some liberal college campuses , and more . RB the desire to be fashionable can be seen as a response to the fear of being excluded . Simple mathematical equations can quite elegantly describe the speed , duration and extensiveness of the spread of beliefs and behaviors . A typical “ diffusion model ” shows how the penetration through a population of such things as beliefs , behaviors , illnesses , innovations or NNS is determined by just a few parameters . These typically include the group ’s size , the density of its members ’ interconnections and the inherent contagiousness of the thing being spread . Irrational beliefs , and the often ill - considered responses they engender , can spread IN an infection across groups as JJ as nations or as JJ as nuclear families . Sunshine , as they VBP , is the best disinfectant . JJ impact NN MD suggest that the best approach to administering JJ disinfectant is via JJ numbers of geographically nearby , authoritative nonbelievers . In the NN of the supposed sonic attacks in Cuba , CD approach to stemming the scare MD be a rapidly deployed on - site investigation by acoustic experts , neurologists , psychiatrists and JJ strategists . A folklorist as well MD n’t hurt . Short of such a full - frontal counterattack , disseminating easy - to - digest skeptical NN as early as possible in the process MD VB to slow the diffusion process and quell the mass delusion . It ’s easy enough to be caught up in a mass delusion . Fads and fashions are great examples , though their most harmful consequence MD be our embarrassment when we look back on some of our previous style choices . As RB as NNS are stressed and living in groups , most of our mass delusions will remain invisible to us until they have already run their course .

When standing on the ground , what ’s VBG on to affect how far NNS can VB ? It ’s things IN : • your eyesight , including the NN and function of the eye itself • the size of the object that you ’re viewing • the curvature of the NNP • any obstructions in your line of sight Let ’s take a look at these influences to understand how the JJ eye can VB as far as it does . The phrase “ visual acuity ” refers to the clarity of your vision . Experts consider normal , or healthy , visual acuity to be 20 / 20 vision . That simply means that you can clearly VB something 20 NNS away that you should be able to VB from that distance . If you have 20/100 vision , you MD still be able to VB an object clearly from 20 NNS away , but someone with normal vision MD VB it clearly from 100 NNS . Conversely , if you have 20 / 12 vision , you can VB something clearly at 20 NNS that most NNS VBP to be 12 NNS from to VB clearly . How does the eye process images ? When you look at anything , a rapid and complex sequence of actions will take place in the eye and brain : • Light reflects off an object and passes through the cornea , which is the transparent outer layer of the eye . • The cornea bends the light rays to allow them to enter the pupil , or the dark center of the eye . • At the same NN , the muscles in the iris — the colored area IN the pupil — VB the size of the pupil , making it smaller in bright light and larger in a darker setting . • Light rays then pass through the lens , which sharpens them as they reach the retina , the thin tissue layer at the back of the eye that contains tiny nerve cells VBN as rods and cones . • The rods and cones convert the light rays into electrical impulses , and these travel from the eye through the optic nerve to the brain , which converts them into images . Assuming that all of the body parts and processes that are necessary for clear vision are working normally , then the limitations on how far you can VB come down to : • the size of the object that you ’re viewing NNS often use the term “ sightline ” in a theater to describe the line of sight from an audience member ’s seat to the stage . But , a sightline is RB any uninterrupted visual angle from a person ’s eyes to what the person is trying to VB . Aside from obvious visual obstructions IN trees , buildings , and clouds , there ’s CD major factor that can reduce your sightline : the curvature of the NNP . The NNP curves about 8 inches per mile . As a result , on a JJ NN with your eyes 5 NNS or so off the ground , the farthest edge that you can VB is about 3 NNS away . To put it another NN , if you ’re standing on a beach in Florida or driving past the farms of Nebraska ( both places where it ’s relatively JJ ) , the farthest part of the horizon that you can VB is about 3 NNS away . If you were lying down on the beach with your head less than a NN off the ground , your eyes MD be able to VB about a mile out over the NN . However , if your vantage point were much higher off the ground , then the horizon line MD be a lot farther away . The curvature of the NNP MD n’t start to cut things off from your view quite so soon . Let ’s VB your drive through Nebraska took you to Scotts Bluff National Monument , and you climbed to the summit at 4,659 NNS . From here , you MD VB Laramie Peak , which is about 100 NNS away in Wyoming , according to the National Park Service . That ’s on a clear day . It ’s not limitless , but it ’s pretty far . Consider the constellation Lyra and its brightest star Vega , which is about 25 light NNS from NNP . Without a telescope or any other visual aid , Vega looks IN a little candle flame in the night sky . That got NNS wondering : How far away MD you be from an actual candle flame on NNP and still VB it the NN you VBP Vega ? NNS measure the brightness of stars by magnitude . A pair of researchers from Texas A&M NNP did some experiments and concluded that a candle flame from about 1,286 NNS away MD have a brightness similar to that of Vega . To take their research a little further — and farther — the NNS experimented to determine the maximum distance you MD be from a candle flame to VB it at all . The researchers decided that someone with healthy vision MD detect a candle flame from about 1.6 NNS away , assuming that there was no fog or other obstructions . The NN is about 238,900 NNS away , and it ’s easy to VB some of its craters , valleys , and plains on a cloudless night . RB closer to home , the view from Mount Everest in the Himalayas — the NN ’s tallest summit at about 29,000 NNS above NN level — offers a view of close to 211 NNS in every direction , according to a user - generated map . Due to the elevation though , clouds often obscure the view . The 124th floor of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai , which is the NN ’s tallest building at more than 2,700 NNS , offers a view of about 50 NNS on a clear day , Reuters reports . The nearly literal skyscraper can RB provide visitors with CD sunsets a day , according to an article in the The Daily Mail . If you VBP your elevator ride to the top just RB , you can VB the NN setting over the horizon . You can then catch the NN again a little later , as the curvature of the NNP and the amazing building height conspire to keep you looking to the west ."

"" Infrastructure at NN of eroding includes three airstrips , roads , causeways and schools , "" he VBD . Why and his survey team documented coastal erosion as an increasingly serious problem affecting JJ of the atoll 's islands and noted the threat of rising NN levels to the entire country .

Mr Loeak VBD that while he was happy to VB NN leaders such as Obama talking about NN NN , it had not changed the fact that NN levels were continuing to rise in the Pacific .

Among JJ achievements , the NN landing is CD that a sliver of society holds in their hearts as a hoax . Other topics , IN the JJ age of the NNP , NNS , and NN NN are hotly debated subjects . According to the NN community , it ’s background noise clogging the airwaves . Scholars VBP an understanding of NN is vital to an informed society , but there are gaps between the source , dissemination , and comprehension of that NN . Last week , Atlanta rapper B.o.B. ( real name Bobby Ray Simmons , Jr. ) tweeted to his 2.3 CD NNP followers that he can prove the NNP is JJ VBN on the lack of curvature of the horizon . That began a short - lived beef with famed astrophysicist Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson , who debunked B.o.B. on the Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore , calling it “ a symptom of a larger problem . ” “ There 's a growing anti-intellectual strain in this country that MD be the beginning of the end of our informed democracy , ” Tyson VBD . “ Of course , in a free society , you can and should VB whatever you VBP . If you VBP to VB the NN is JJ , VB RB ahead , but if you VBP the NN is JJ , and you have influence over others , as with successful rappers , or RB presidential candidates , then being wrong becomes being harmful to the NN , wealth , and security of our citizenry . ” Tyson intentionally did a “ mic drop ” before walking off stage . B.o.B. is far from alone . NN literacy is relatively low in the NNP NNPS and other NNS . Read More : NNS Do n’t VB NN . So What Does ? » NN Literacy Not the Best in the U.S . According to the National NNP Foundation , most Americans VBP the NNP travels IN the NN but are n’t familiar with the basics of the scientific method . A Pew Research Center survey of 3,278 adults VBD most Americans have a decent understanding of basic scientific NN , such as the NNP ’s core is the hottest layer . Other complicated concepts , IN why the boiling point of NN in higher altitudes occurs at a lower NN , are tougher for them to grasp . These are subjects that should be covered in high school . JJ ideas , findings , or technology , however , are RB harder to permeate society . Adam Ruben , Ph.D. , a molecular biologist and author who has taught classes on the NN ’s perception of NN at Johns Hopkins NNP , VBD issues IN in vitro fertilization and genetically modified crops are often wrought with misunderstanding — as if NNS are making Frankenstein ’s monster . “ It ’s JJ NNS do n’t understand NN . The great thing about NN is that it does n’t require belief , ” Ruben VBD Healthline . “ There ’s always VBG to be a contingent of society , no matter the technology , that views NNS made to the NN nature functions as bad . ” NN requires a certain level of skepticism in the name of discovery , but it RB involves not ignoring NNS and facts to come to a conclusion . “ When you hear a JJ discovery , your reaction should n’t be to immediately dismiss it , and no scientist MD VB you to blindly accept it , ” Ruben VBD . “ Your reaction should be to VB to learn more about it . ” Of all the NN fallacies out there , Ruben assures NNS NNS do not VB NN . He should VB ; he works on a NN for malaria . But the discomfort of watching a stranger ( i.e. nurse or NN ) stabbing his kids with needles does make him feel IN a rotten dad . “ Now as a parent , I can VB why NNS MD n’t VB to vaccinate their kids , ” he VBD . John Pellino , associate director of the Talcott Mountain NNP Center , VBZ there are a slew of issues at play in the NN ’s view of NN . These include authority , shortcuts in translation in the NN , how NNS VBP to reduce complexity , and that NNS prefer a familiar problem to a novel solution . “ That goes for NN , relationships , cars , pets , all sorts of things , ” Pellino VBD Healthline . “ NN is hard . NN involves mental and physical work , and according to models of brain physiology , you actually re-wire neural networks in your brain matter to do this . No JJ task biologically , but we can actually do this sort of amazing brain morphing thing . ” All of these factors create a perfect storm of assumptions , comfort , and simplification , Pellino added . “ If you leave it at that , you can live a simple NN with some potential disasters from JJ assumptions . If you push beyond it — something NNS are famous for — you can live an amazingly exhilarating NN with JJ discoveries IN every bend , ” he VBD . “ That ’s the feeling that makes it worth it all for NNS in NN , nature , and engineering — that chance that you ’ll be the JJ to the JJ , RB JJ , thing . ” Anca Ioviţă , a physician in Romania , VBD when NNS have an opportunity to learn , formal or not , they can become “ addicted to illusions ” as a NN to deal with their own mortality . “ That is why afterlife stories or VB - rich - quick scams are so popular . Or alternative medicine that promises you a cancer cure that is CD check apart , ” she VBD Healthline . “ And no matter how much NN and medicine will progress , mortality and our own awareness of it will always exist . Hence , quacks will always have a job . ” Read More : NN Systems Now a Focus of Cancer Treatments » For some , it ’s overwhelming to grasp the NNP is actually billions of NNS old or that NNS share a common ancestor with apes . David Bell — a Catholic , licensed counselor , and JJ Air Force researcher — VBZ ego MD play into the disbelief we were created just as random bits in the universe . “ We are obviously special in some NN , as evidenced by all of the things we have accomplished in this NN , both bad and good . No other NNS has RB come close , ” he VBD Healthline . “ This does make us special . This naturally leads CD to wonder , why are we special ? What made us special ? The non -believer will simply VB it was luck , but the believer will VB that our Creator made us special . ” Bell VBZ there are numerous psychological issues at play when NNS do n’t VB certain things to be JJ . That includes confirmation bias , where we only seek NN that supports our pre-existing beliefs . The existence of NNP , Bell VBZ , is CD thing NN will never be able to answer because it ’s not something that can be measured . “ NN is about how things work and VBP . Religion is about why things exist in the JJ place , ” he VBD . “ They are complementary areas of NN , where each can inform the other , but neither can dismiss the other . ” So How Do We Improve NN Literacy ? Besides improving NN education in schools , scientific communication is crucial . JJ scientific research reaches the NN through the filter of the NN , which NNS feel often sensationalizes findings in headlines . In a 2009 survey of more than 2,500 NNS , about three - quarters VBP the NN does a poor job of distinguishing well - founded NN , while about half VBP NN oversimplification of scientific findings is a major problem . Outspoken NNS IN Tyson , NNP Nye , and Michio Kaku have inspired generations of JJ NNS through NN education in the NN . Ruben , who watched “ Mr. Wizard ” growing up and now co-hosts the NNP Channel ’s “ Outrageous Acts of NNP , ” VBD more NNS VBP to communicate more with those outside of scientific research . “ We do have a shortage of NNS who are watched by non-scientists , ” he VBD . RB , Ruben noted , is the capability for inaccurate NN to spread easily via JJ NN without verifying its accuracy . “ We can share with CD click , ” he VBD . “ Reading takes NN . ” Non-scientists ’ influence in the NN continues to VB air NN IN Fox NNP host NNP O’Reilly saying there ’s no NN to explain tides . Or , as Tyson alluded to , presidential candidate Donald NNP spreading inaccurate NN on issues from JJ NN to the Ebola NN . JJ experts , including Bell and Pellino , VBP these kinds of debates in the NN are merely attention - seeking grabs at fame . In the NN of the JJ NNP NN , who ’s the better source of NN ?

By_IN the_DT way_NN ,_, I_PRP still_RB cannot_MD believe_VB I_PRP had_VBD to_TO write_VB this_DT ._.","It is stunning that I have to write this article , but I do . A popular rapper has launched a GoFundMe to prove that the NNP is JJ . Several professional basketball players have RB weighed in with their perspective . The picture of NNP below is pretty definitive , but there are basic meteorological "" pieces of NN "" too . Herein , I explore three of the most important ones . Sunsets : Have you ever watched a sunset ? If so , it is a compelling "" duh "" that the NNP is not JJ . If you observe the horizon at sunset , typically the NN disappears from your view in a bottom - up direction . In a very simple experiment described on the PBS website , This fact is how ancient sailors knew that NNP was spherical ( and the fact that they did not sail off of some mythical edge ) . As the NN falls increasingly below the horizon , more of the shorter wavelength light is scattered out as it travels through more of the atmosphere . This scattering leaves the longer wavelength colors of reddish - orange . General circulation of the atmosphere : It is intuitive to most NNS that it is warm in the tropical regions of the NN and cool in the polar regions . Because of the NNP 's curvature , the mid-section of NNP receives more of the direct radiation from the NN . This means that there is more heat concentrated in the tropical atmosphere and ocean . The NNP satellite maps below illustrate that this radiation imbalance is prevalent irrespective of season . The NNP is continually trying to remove the excess heat in the tropics . CD NN that NNP tries to put itself on a "" heat "" diet to remove excess heat in the mid-section is through poleward - moving ocean currents . A good example in the NNP NNPS is the Gulf Stream . It is a warm , poleward flowing current . Hurricanes are another mechanism that transports excess heat from the tropics to the poles . The general circulation of the atmosphere RB evolves because of the net imbalance of heating . In its simplest form , the air rises over the warmer tropics and sinks over the cooler polar regions . This is a thermally - direct circulation . In reality , it is a bit more complex as described on NOAA website , Since the NN rotates , the axis is tilted , and there is more land mass in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere , the actual JJ pattern is much more complicated . Instead of CD JJ circulation between the poles and the equator , there are three circulations . ( 1 ) Hadley cell - Low latitude air movement toward the equator that with heating , rises vertically , with poleward movement in the upper atmosphere . This forms a convection cell that dominates tropical and sub-tropical climates . ( 2 ) Ferrel cell - A mid-latitude mean atmospheric circulation cell for NN named by Ferrel in the 19th century . In this cell the air flows poleward and eastward near the NN and equatorward and westward at higher levels . ( 3 ) Polar cell - Air rises , diverges , and travels toward the poles . Once over the poles , the air sinks , forming the polar highs . At the NN air diverges outward from the polar highs . NN winds in the polar cell are easterly ( polar easterlies ) . This general circulation model is directly tied to JJ patterns of high - low pressure , jet streams , and NN systems . NN radar : I cut my teeth as a radar meteorologist . Some of my earliest graduate work at Florida NNP NNP developed NN radar algorithms to track hurricanes . I RB teach a radar and mesoscale meteorology course at the NNP of Georgia . CD of the fundamental concepts that we discuss is how curvature of the NNP impacts rainfall detection . The example at a National NNP Service website describes it well , A storm between the Birmingham ( BMX ) and Maxwell AFB ( MXX ) radars ( VB image below ) . If the storm is a good distance away from BMX , due to the fact that the radar beam is straight and does n't follow the NNP 's NN , the lowest elevation scan from BMX MD only be able to "" VB "" into the middle portion of the storm . If that same storm is closer to MXX , this will allow us to "" look "" into the lower portion of that same storm , possibly allowing us to detect a rotational couplet closer to the NNP 's NN . From this , we MD infer that given the JJ circumstances , the formation of a tornado is possible . By the NN , I still cannot VB I had to write this ."

A precise topographical map has been made of CD of the flattest places on NNP : the salar de Uyuni , a vast plain of white cemented salt in the mountains of Bolivia . The ground survey , aided by JJ positioning systems ( GPS ) , shows variations in elevation of less than a metre across an area almost half the size of Wales . Intriguingly , the work reveals bumps in the salt that lie above lumps of dense rock buried several kilometres below , just as NN will bulge over a bump on the ocean floor . Knowing exactly where these bumps lie will VB researchers to use the NN as a giant calibration device for satellite - VBN radar and laser altimeters . Adrian Borsa , a geophysicist at the US Geological Survey in Pasadena , California , led the work that is now reporting the most precise GPS characterization yet of the salt JJ , accurate to 2.2 centimetres . Borsa and his colleagues began the research in 2002 , with a campaign that combined NNS from fixed GPS stations with ‘ kinematic GPS ’ NNS obtained by crisscrossing the salar in trucks fitted with GPS antennae . “ It ’s as if you ’re on a white ocean with no waves , ” VBZ Borsa . “ You VBP the horizon , the curvature of NNP . It ’s absolutely featureless . ” The NN was commissioned specifically as a NN to calibrate NNP ’s ICESat , launched in 2003 to VB NN sheets in Antarctica and Greenland . Satellites can calibrate their altimeters by bouncing signals off the ocean NN , the height of which is well established . But because of atmospheric interference , tides and waves , there are uncertainties . Borsa VBZ the salar , now so accurately mapped and with dry , clear skies , is about five times better than the ocean as a reference point . The results have been helpful , VBZ Sinead Farrell , a researcher at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who is VBG ICESat to measure NNS in NN NN . “ It ’s the JJ calibration NN that we look at , ” she VBZ . “ The NN that they provide is useful to all the other teams . ” She adds that the salt NN is RB being VBN for Envisat , a European satellite , and MD be VBN to calibrate future orbiters such as Cryosat - 2 , a planned European NN - monitoring mission . Whereas the NNP - observing community likes the flatness of the salar , geologists are interested in the tiny undulations . The strength of gravity varies from place to place IN NNP — imperceptibly to NNS but in ways that NNS have mapped precisely — owing to the density of objects nearby . Borsa VBD that the salt had created faint mounds of some 40 centimetres in height over regions of slightly higher gravity , owing to high - density volcanic rocks kilometres below . “ We VBD a rare breed of topography , ” VBZ Borsa , who VBZ that this is the JJ NN a land NN has been shown to undulate in step with the gravitational field IN this . “ Here ’s a place where you VBP the imprint of the gravitational field due to buried mountain ranges . ” Borsa has a NN as to how this happened . When the salar floods , as it does every five NNS or so , salt dissolves and , in solution , flows to regions of higher gravity , he VBZ . This phenomenon is already VBN to oceanographers : the free - standing ocean NN VBZ slightly to match the pull of gravity underneath . So there are slight bulges in the ocean in places directly above submarine seamounts . “ We VBP that ocean surfaces follow the gravitational potential NN : the geoid , ” VBZ Farrell , who was not a part of the NN . “ It is a JJ result to show that the salt NN RB follows the geoid . ” The next step for those with a geological interest , Borsa VBZ , is to take out the portion of the elevation variations that are due to gravity and VBP what ’s left . So far , he is seeing a strange , regularly patterned checkerboard NN . He does n’t VB what MD produce it , but speculates that it MD reflect the imprint of periodic pressures due to prevailing winds . Working out the forces that produce this pattern MD be useful if similar phenomena are ever spotted on another NN , he VBZ . “ Now we ’ve got an analogue on NNP . ”"

How to communicate effectively ? Who knows how we ’ve experienced a sense of community in other dimensions , once upon a JJ NN ago ? We MD all live with a cellular / DNA – memory of unity and oneness from an existence before the start of the veiling process . A memory in and of Awakening . It seems that now , after living with a “ horizontal ” consciousness expansion , limited by the concept of material expansion on a NN seemingly existing as a self - contained NN form , RB as a JJ NNP , than as a globe and centre of “ the Universe ” ( yet unseen ) after Galilei ’s exclamation “ And yet she ’s round ! ” As a celestial body circling IN the NNP , with other NN - bodies forming the Solar NNP as yet another part of the entire Galaxy , in our technologically more advanced NN , observed through the eyes of cameras , we ’re all touched and affected by a storm of NN that is in progress at a 90 degree angle : a “ vertical ” consciousness expansion in much tumult , clanging and banging , much topsy turvy . I choose a direction North - South for ease of understanding dimensional shifts in sync with the term “ Ascension ” which means to JJ religious NNS “ rising up to the heavens ” with images illustrating a figure carried on the weightless substance of clouds . When rising above the quirkiness of personal styles in approach and awake and alert to the vagueness of presence and intention ( in virtual communications ) we can step forward and connect by addressing the issues that are rising within us , communicating our feelings and the experience of how actions of others affect us and how we feel our own actions affect others . By being informed about their impact on others who make an effort to offer feedback , honouring their own value as much as the value of the person on the other side of the screen , or table . The desire that PRP ’s presence matters in a community , can lead to JJ expressions , depending on a force of will , making a point for the sake of fanatism , a NN for attention or competition , by challenging an authority , or a warm - hearted service as a means to fulfilment of PRP ’s own desire in sync with PRP ’s desire to serve a general sense of wellbeing in all . Issues that are rising between 2 NNS , showing up in their CD - on - CD communication RB , or in the practice of working together in the physical NN , should best be kept in that close encounter of a duet . It takes CD to tango and not CD or more than 2 , for is n’t stepping on each other ’s toes sufficient NN to pay attention properly ? To me , it ’s an interesting subject to discuss community - creation and without expecting you or others here to address all of them , here are a couple of questions : – How does it look IN , your favoured community ? How MD you describe your NN in it ? – What makes or breaks a community ? – What ’s the difference in a virtual and physical community ? If there ’s CD at all . – What ’s causing members of a community to feel inspired and at ease ? – What ’s required to maintain a community in liveliness and sparkly vibes , open to NN ? – Should there be an intention and foundation on which a community is built and functioning ? – Should a community - to - be start with a gathering of NNS at random , spontaneously / casually formed ? – Is a community a work in progress , with a common interest showing up in due NN , which my become the core of an intentional community ? – Should a community grow organically , by a coming and VBG of members without a fixed plan for an “ end- product ” or “ end-result ? ” – Are members of a community open to leaving and trying out JJ forms of communities ? – Should a community be a living organism that is in motion and NN always . Moving RB freely nd explore JJ forms of community is a great learning curve in my perception . When a genuine attempt is made to VB , attune and learn . Use of discernment can be trained due to a variety of experiences and encounters with NNS of all walks of NN and RB NN - races . In the latter NN communication becomes a whole JJ concept , I imagine . To me , the form and subject of a chosen service are CD very JJ things . – Is transparency of decision making and reports of financial manoeuvers to all members of a community , who contribute financially , a must and a benefit ? There are questions about community living “ How to live together ? ” that countless JJ generations have pondered and discussed , forgotten , buried and dug up , dusted off and , at times , placed on an altar . The following statement I hold close to my heart : “ Once upon a NN in the civilized NN the monarch and the JJ servants who honoured their oath of allegiance , delivered to the NNS freedom , justice , leisure and instruction by facilitating instruction and apprenticeship . The city - NN encouraged each individual to develop special skills appropriate to the ascribed natural or genetic abilities of that individual , to meet the JJ needs of the wider community , the pursuit of excellence in each department was a matter of honour where self - interest led to a duty of care towards fellow citizens and the overall success of that community ” Edmund Marriage 2004 Disclaimer : We at Prepare for NN ( PFC ) bring you NN that is not offered by the mainstream NN , and therefore MD seem controversial . The opinions , views , statements , and / or NN we present are not necessarily promoted , endorsed , espoused , or agreed to by Prepare for NNP , its leadership Council , members , those who work with PFC , or those who read its NN . However , they are hopefully provocative . Please use discernment !

' Sincle the faked NN landings in 1969 NNP has moved onto faking Mars landings with the 1976 Viking , 1997 Pathfinder , and 2007 Phoenix . RB after ' landing ' they got straight to work photo shopping the famous ' Face on Mars , ' Martian pyramids , and the supposed Martian city of Cydonia . NNP shills IN Richard Hoagland and Steven Greer have ever since been propagating the idea that this and other ' NN ' proves the existence of extra-terrestrial aliens . Just IN the faked NN landings , however , their NN fiction ' Mars ' landings are utter bold faced lies . ' CD of the uses of the Phoenix Project , in the use of NNP Tunnels , was to provide backup to the Martian Colonies . The Martian Colonies have been there since the early 1970s . We went publicly to the NN in 1969 . Actually the Germans were there in 1947 . And we were there in 1962 with a joint U.S. - Russian expedition . They went to Mars , NNP 22 , 1962 . The movie , Altenative 3 , done by Anglia Television , April 1 , 1977 , which is available in the underground , outlines it completely . It shows the actual transmission . The color shots by TV back from Mars , as this Explorer moved and landed . We have colonies there in Mars from the late 1960s or maybe early 1970s onward . They VBD JJ artifacts there . There is more than CD wrecked city . And of course there is the famous face on Mars , the Pyramids and that whole complex that Dr. Richard Hoagland has talked about and gone JJ on . There are CD videos on this plus his book . What they VBD on the NN indicated there was much more there that they MD not find that was buried . And they had not brought with them , and did not have the capabilities of heavy NN - moving equipment on Mars at that NN . They didnt have any Cats . JJ tractors and that sort of stuff . They were too heavy to bring up . So , a request went by radio back to NNP ,  We VBP there are underground installations here . Weve seen openings that are sealed . Can you guys down there tell us what to do ?  Well , the NN went to Montauk , to the Phoenix Project . And they sent back NN ,  Well , give us some coordinates on the NN of Mars where you VBP these locations are . And they did . And they VBD ,  Well investigate it .  And they did . Because they MD VB any place with the tunnel , they went to Mars to the coordinates . And RB they didnt send anybody . They ran a tunnel into what they thought might be an underground area and rather than NN killing anybody by burying them in solid rock , they sent a camera , a remote - view camera . We VBD out there was an actual cavern and it was safe . Then Montauk sent NNS . Duncan and I were in that crew . The JJ crew that went was directed by Montauk to explore the underground of Mars . It 's not mentioned in the book who went , but we went . And there were probably others . We went several times . We VBD all kinds of artifacts . We VBD a still functional underground lighting NN , a NN NN . We VBD it and turned it on and it still worked . No NN of NN .

Apple VBD it will use recycled rare earths in its “ Taptic Engine , ” a part that lets iPhones mimic a physical button click despite being a JJ pane of glass . The part is about CD - quarter of the rare NN elements inside the iPhone models . Rare earths , a group of 17 specialized minerals , have become a flash point in trade tensions between the NNP NNPS and NNP . The elements are VBN in weapons , consumer electronics and other goods . NNP dominates the processing of the raw minerals , and has implied through its NN - controlled NN that it MD restrict rare earths NNS to the NNP NNPS , just as it did to Japan after a diplomatic dispute in 2010 . Lisa Jackson , Apple ’s vice NN of environment , policy and JJ initiatives , VBD Apple ’s use of recycled rare earths was “ not related ” to trade tensions but MD VB it maintain a steady supply . “ This is CD of those happy coincidences where what is good for the NN is RB good for business at the same NN , ” Jackson VBD Reuters . “ CD of the things we talk about a lot internally , just in general , is how much more resilient this makes our supply chain . ” In consumer electronics , rare earths reside in tiny speakers and actuators . The parts are so JJ that collecting them for recycling is difficult and expensive . For now , Apple will use recycled rare earths from an outside supplier , not from previously VBN iPhones . Apple declined to name the supplier or VB what NNS the rare earths were recovered from , though the NN did VB the source was post - industrial , meaning material generated during manufacturing processes rather than from discarded consumer NNS . Jackson VBD that Apple ’s scale - JJ iPhone models are typically sell tens of millions of units per NN - helped make the project economically viable . “ We have essentially made a NN for this entrepreneur , this innovator , who VBD a NN to recycle rare earths , ” Jackson VBD . Kyle Wiens , the chief executive of iFixit , a NN focused on repairing and reusing electronics , VBD Apple ’s move was a JJ for the industry . “ Rare NN elements are n’t being recycled from electronics RB now , and that ’s a huge problem — NNP has a stranglehold on the virgin material supply , ” Wiens VBD . “ This is a great idea — Apple MD single - handedly create a hugely needed NN for recycled rare earths . ” Apple often aims to reuse parts from its old devices . Apple VBD on Wednesday that aluminum from enclosures recovered through its trade - in programs will be melted down and made into JJ MacBook Air laptop computers . The NN previously disclosed that cobalt recovered from iPhone batteries disassembled by robots at its recycling labs in Texas is put into JJ iPhone batteries . Apple is experimenting with ways to recover rare earths from its phones VBG its robots , which can remove tiny parts and separate them into collection bins to aggregate enough material to make recycling viable . The NN is RB researching ways that conventional recyclers , who shred devices and separate out the various materials , MD tweak their lines to recover the elements , NN that Jackson VBD Apple is open to sharing . “ There are some innovations of ours that we actually VBP NNS to copy . So as much as possible - as RB as it does n’t give away some of our other design and engineering innovation - we are happy to bring along the recycling industry , ” Jackson VBD . “ We have started to be much more transparent IN this technology development than we usually are . ”"

Gonna teach you about The Monster today ! Instead of my usual review of the week , I ’m VBG to put up for your reading pleasure , five of my articles you MD , or MD not have seen from the five hundred sum odd pieces the Tea Party Tribune has been kind enough to publish for me over the last three NNS . When you write an article you tend to VB it ’s a masterpiece . I bury “ Easter Eggs ” in every NN . A good example of that is in “ NNP Baby and The Trip To Bountiful , ” where in CD line I replaced “ The Principal ” with the words “ The Principle ” alluding to polygamy . It got by a lot of NNS but the principal who let my grandson VB skipping across Main Street in Brigham City got my point , and he ’s been mad ever since . Sorry for Party rocking Dude ! I RB include at least CD mistake for liberals who search my stuff to challenge my literacy . An it ’s for its or a comma for a period . For every fifty to CD hundred articles that are penned , PRP will be the “ monster ! ” While on a typical run an article will struggle for reads , these certain works will take off a bit faster . Then you ’ll notice a comment later on that article , but not from the Trib . It ’ll come from USA Today , or some other publication where part or all of the article was VBN or cited . That ’s when you VBP back and check the numbers and VBD article will move into the “ DAYUM ” section . These five are those types of works . I did n’t learn journalism in any college . I learned to spin a yarn in Nashville . The same methods that make a song “ cook ” will chicken fry an article . Methods UH make a point and return to it toward the end to reinforce the theme . Do n’t keep repeating “ ands ” and “ buts . ” Write IN you speak . I do n’t have a JJ problem with spelling because I ’m ignorant and do n’t use a whole lot of JJ words . I try not to lie . . . much , but I ’ll use innuendo to worm IN a subject or person ( such as that principal ) to make my point . FYI : The reason my five NN old grand baby got out in the street unsupervised was he was too infatuated with a certain teacher . Little light hearted jab on an embarrassing era of Mormon history , add a dash of innuendo and voila ! Principal soup ! But you VBP I ’m bad . While I ’m on that subject , I VBP to explain why I pick on Mormons so often . RB though I ’m an old “ Reptile Bait ” I ’ve been covered UP with Latter Day Saints for over thirty NNS . My wife ’s and for that matter my daughter in law ’s family are Temple Worthy all the NN back to Joseph Smith . I did write Joseph Did You VB about the Mormon culture , and I ’m fascinated with their history , but if I ever stepped into a Temple my hair MD catch on fire . I use the same method when addressing race baiters , JJ Correctness , and NNS who are confused by common sense . I read my stuff out loud . That ’s an old songwriter ’s trick . My friends VBP I ’m crazy because I always seem to be talking to myself . If it wo n’t roll smoothly off your tongue it will irritate or confuse the reader . Finding subjects to write about is not hard . I can actually write about things I VBP very little of . When I began to write for Raging Elephants Radio on Doc Greene ’s show I actually knew very little about the Texas movements of secession and nullification . In NN I learned , but for about six months it was mostly style , style , style . I do research . Usually on NNP . I will sometimes spend up to a week familiarizing myself with a subject before I write anything about it . CD subject I never MD RB cope with was the NNP NNP Society . I tried , but I simply MD n’t drink enough whiskey to make any sense out of it . I try not to rag on the Cartels or Muslims too much because I do n’t VB to VB bombed or shot . That all having been VBN , I VBP you will enjoy these pieces . IN a hit song I MD feel them coming off my pen , so to speak . Each NN directly addresses some facet of the JJ experience . Each NN promoted itself to the “ DAYUM ” status . I do n’t buy into inspiration but I will VB these five came out of nowhere , so I guess there is someone out there looking out for us . It has been my honor and my joy to share with you guys and gals . The Best Is Yet To Come About ( TLB ) Contributor NNP and the gang at The Butcher Shop The Butcher Shop is an alternative NN source VBN in the Tea Party Tribune with an eye on NNP , family , and preservation of NNP . It is a collection of minds started by NNP the Butcher , a conservative op / ed journalist who began publishing forty NNS ago . We strive to make the articles informative , entertaining , and diverse . All you VBP will VB you to stop and consider . We try not to drone on with the same old day after day clap trap that MD have driven you away from mainstream NN . You will read things here that you will VB nowhere else . We are from London to Austin to the Escalanté . So , what ’s your cut of meat ? Shop RB . The Butcher Shop is happy to fill your order . The Liberty Beacon Project is now expanding at a near exponential rate , and for this we are grateful and excited ! But we must RB be practical . For 7 NNS we have not asked for any donations , and have built this project with our own funds as we grew . We are now experiencing ever increasing growing pains due to the JJ number of websites and projects we represent .

When they check their e-mail , they do it on their phones , not their computers ; when they make phone calls , they do it on their computers via Skype , not their phones . You can VB why other writers let this stuff slide . You have to come up with JJ kinds of stories in a networked NN . The usual missed connections and mistaken identities do n't cut it  how JJ Shakespearean tragedies MD have been averted with GPS and NNP ? Not that we do n't have problems now , NNP knows , but when you take our modern technological predicament seriously , you realize that those old problems have to be rerouted , and that the stories have to VB shape accordingly . They start to become less about missed connections and more about overconnectedness . They start to look IN Reamde . Reamde is Stephenson 's 10th novel ( not counting his occasional collaborations and the unclassifiable JJ fiction project The Mongoliad ) , and he has yet to write an uninteresting NN . In Reamde we find him slimming down to middleweight after five straight heavyweight bouts : the cryptographical epic Cryptonomicon , the 2,500 - page three - novel Baroque Cycle and then Anathem , a philosophical novel set on an alt - universe NN where monasteries are consecrated to higher mathematics . Stephenson 's abiding preoccupation is NN flow , and how NN shapes the lives of the NNS RB and through whom it flows . He is generally tagged as a NN - fiction novelist , but that categorization is difficult to support on the NN  the Baroque Cycle was set in the 17th and 18th centuries and stuck to existing history , more or less . ( Isaac Newton is a major character ; the NN turns on his little - VBN role as Master of the Mint . ) "" NN fiction "" describes Stephenson 's interests , but not his methods . While recognizably Stephensonian , Reamde is less about the flow of NN through JJ networks than it is about the flow of bullets out of guns . This is , RB and foremost , a Bourne - style international thriller , and as such its intellectual sites are set lower than those of its immediate predecessors . The hero of Reamde is  or at JJ appears to be  Richard Forthrast , founder of a NNP of Warcraftesque massively multiplayer fantasy game called T'Rain . Richard is an amiable enough guy in his 50s , living in Seattle , with NN too much NN and NN too little in the NN of emotional or , for that matter , physical connections to the NN IN him . This VBZ when he hires his niece Zula , an Eritrean refugee adopted by his sister , and takes a mentor 's interest in her . Zula is a crack programmer but not , it turns out , a crack picker of boyfriends . Hers sells stolen NN to some Russian gangsters , and the deal goes south when a NN from T'Rain called Reamde  the intentional typo stops bothering you after a while , though it does n't VB easier to pronounce  encrypts the NNS . The gangsters promptly kidnap the boyfriend and Zula and head off in search of the NN writer , who 's got an IP address in NNP , specifically in the city of Xiamen . At this point Zula takes over as the story 's focus . She 's press - ganged into a pack of captive hackers and soldiers of fortune who pursue JJ the NN writers and then , as the narrative upshifts , a bin Ladenesque Islamic terrorist . ( The NN of focus is a bit jarring . But it 's a JJ story  Reamde clocks in at over 1,000 pages . ) The pace of Reamde is rapid and unwavering  the plot automatically extrudes twists , JJ settings and RB fresh major characters at precisely calibrated intervals . The characters ping - pong IN the globe as if geography were an afterthought and communicate via a pidgin English largely VBN on NN games , which is their shared frame of reference . These are NNS who , in any earlier incarnation of JJ civilization , MD never have met CD another . But now they have , and not because they wished to , but because the logic of NN and NN requires it , and because the now JJ , frictionless NN no longer has the NN to keep them apart . But the story of Reamde is mostly there as a superstructure for Stephenson 's observations about how the NN IN us actually works  the background is the foreground . There 's a marvelous sequence late in the book when the characters become transfixed by what 's happening on a computer , and Stephenson , without pausing or RB slowing down the NN , weaves in a concise explanation of how a computer monitor works and why it looks the NN it does . You do n't bog down in it  the explanation is the NN and the moment feels real , because we understand not just what 's happening but RB why and how , down to the submolecular level . This realness serves Stephenson 's themes well : he likes to play with the sharp sheer between the NN as it is and how it appears in the cartoon looking glass of pop culture . Asked why the Russian criminals VBP he and Zula can find the author of Reamde , a no-nonsense Hungarian programmer replies , "" Because we are hackers , and they have seen movies . "" The joke of watching a bunch of NN - game addicts VBP caught up in actual shootouts never gets old : RB in the middle of a finely turned Mexican standoff on a dock in Xiamen , the terrorist delivers a lecture on the eccentricities of the firing mechanism of the Makarov pistol that his opponent is holding against his head . In Stephenson 's NN , victory generally goes to the guy who 's read the manual . If there is an overarching theme to Reamde , it 's the importance of drilling down through easy bull ---- explanations to the tough , complicated substrate of the real NN beneath  the importance of not satisfying yourself with the vague approximations of NN games and , for that matter , sub -Stephensonian writers . Toward the end of the book , Richard , the archillusionist of T'Rain , finds himself on the run and in desperate nonvirtual danger , but instead of despairing he finds his situation perversely exhilarating : "" No NN MD reach him via phone or e-mail , NNP or NNP , and bother him . His whole NN , his whole attention was focused on CD thing for the JJ NN that he MD remember . "" It 's worthy of note that Stephenson  an early prophet of virtual reality , whose novel Snow Crash materially influenced the development of the Internet itself  is less interested in the consensual hallucinations of cyberspace than he is in the stuff we use it to escape from . The Internet is all well and good , but reality is still the ultimate hack . VB NNP 's NN about the scientific NN behind Flash Forward . Read about the Top CD Everything of 2008 ."

Term structure of interest rates , commonly VBN as the yield curve , depicts the interest rates of similar quality bonds at JJ maturities . Essentially , term structure of interest rates is the relationship between interest rates or bond yields and JJ terms or maturities . When graphed , the term structure of interest rates is VBN as a yield curve , and it plays a crucial role in identifying the current NN of an economy . The term structure of interest rates reflects expectations of NN participants about future NNS in interest rates and their assessment of monetary policy conditions . In general terms , yields increase in line with maturity , giving rise to an upward - sloping , or normal , yield curve . The yield curve is primarily VBN to illustrate the term structure of interest rates for standard U.S. NN - issued securities . This is important as it is a gauge of the debt NN 's feeling about NN . The most frequently reported yield curve compares the three - month , CD - NN , five - NN , CD - NN , and 30 - NN U.S. Treasury debt . ( Yield curve rates are usually available at the Treasury 's interest rate web sites by 6:00 p.m. NN each trading day ) , The term of the structure of interest rates has three primary shapes . • Upward sloping — JJ term yields are higher than short term yields . This is considered to be the "" normal "" slope of the yield curve and signals that the economy is in an expansionary mode . • Downward sloping — short term yields are higher than JJ term yields . Dubbed as an "" inverted "" yield curve and signifies that the economy is in , or about to enter , a recessive period . • JJ — very little variation between short and JJ term yields . Signals that the NN is unsure about the future direction of the economy . This yield curve is considered the benchmark for the credit NN , as it reports the yields of NN - free fixed income investments across a range of maturities . In the credit NN , banks and lenders use this benchmark as a gauge for determining lending and savings rates . Yields along the U.S. Treasury yield curve are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve ’s federal funds rate . Other yield curves can RB be developed VBN upon a comparison of credit investments with similar NN characteristics . Most often , the Treasury yield curve is upward - sloping . CD basic explanation for this phenomenon is that investors demand higher interest rates for longer - term investments as compensation for investing their NN in longer - duration investments . Occasionally , JJ - term yields MD fall below short - term yields , creating an inverted yield curve that is generally regarded as a harbinger of recession . The Outlook for the Overall Credit NN The term structure of interest rates and the direction of the yield curve can be VBN to judge the overall credit NN environment . A flattening of the yield curve means longer - term rates are falling in comparison to short - term rates , which MD have implications for a recession . When short - term rates begin to exceed JJ - term rates , the yield curve is inverted , and a recession is likely occurring or approaching . When longer - term rates fall below shorter - term rates , the outlook for credit over the JJ term is weak . This is often consistent with a weak or recessionary economy , which is defined by CD consecutive periods of negative growth in the gross domestic product ( GDP ) . While other factors , including foreign demand for U.S. Treasuries , can RB result in an inverted yield curve , historically , an inverted yield curve has been an indicator of an impending recession in the NNP NNPS ."

A Ph.D. Student has presented a thesis claiming the NNP is JJ , stationary , the center of the universe and only RB 13,500 NNS old . Yup , you read JJ . The thesis was submitted to CD assessors , thus passing the JJ stage of approvals . The idea that the NNP is ‘ NNP ’ is , in fact , a relatively JJ NN . In fact , before anyone came up with the idea we live on a JJ plane , NNS knew very well the NNP was round . RB though there are countless images of our NN , and numerous videos which have been recorded from NN , there are still some who argue the NNP is in fact JJ . CD of them is a Ph.D. student who rocked the Arab scientific community when she presented her thesis claiming the NNP is JJ , stationary , the center of the universe and only RB 13,500 NNS old . Yup , you read JJ . Not only did he suggest we live on a JJ NNP , he RB rejected scientific NNS presented by Newton and Einstein , astronomical discoveries made by Copernicus and Kepler , the NNP Bang NN , atmospheric and geological activity , most of modern climatology , and basically all other scientific teachings made in the past . According to an article written by the Gulf NNP , the student presented her thesis after a staggering five NNS of work . Eventually , it was submitted to CD assessors , thus passing the JJ stage of approvals . The reports were expected soon , for the thesis defense to be scheduled . This ‘ shocking ’ doctoral thesis suggests that the NN we live on is JJ , very young and that it remains stationary at the MIDDLE of the universe . Furthermore — if that was n’t enough — the thesis claims that the NNP has an average diameter of 1,135 kilometers and NOT 1.4 CD km . The NN has a width of 908 km , and are located 687 and 23 times closer to NNP respectively . In addition , the thesis claims there are 11 planets and STARS in the sky are LIMITED in number and have a diameter of 292 kilometers and not millions of kilometers . In the meantime , the NNP of the Tunisian Astronomical Association somehow managed to VB his hands on a leaked copy of the thesis , proving it was not a hoax and posted in on NNP . As noted by Gulf NNP , JJ NNS consider these claims ridiculous , and scandalous since the thesis firmly rejects ALL modern NN . Others , however , have VBN it extremely disturbing since the thesis was written by a Ph.D. NN student , and the professor is the ‘ highest ’ in academia . Furthermore , Gulf NNP adds : “ Indeed , we find in the conclusions of the thesis clear indications of this stand and approach , expressions such as : “ VBG physical and religious arguments ” , “ RB proving the NN scale of [ Noah ’s ] flood ” , “ proposed a JJ kinematic approach that conforms to the verses of the Quran ” , “ the roles of the stars are : ( 1 ) to be ornaments of the sky ; ( 2 ) to stone the devils ; and ( 3 ) as signs to guide creatures in the darkness of NN ” ; and finally “ the geo- centric model … accords with the verses of the Quran and the pronouncements of our Prophet . ”"

ESPN ’s Jackie MacMullen reports that is close to coming together in the form of a second NBA bubble in Chicago . The details are still being hammered out , and teams continue to push for an alternative plan that MD enable them to hold mini-camps within their local markets and to explore the idea of establishing regional sites where teams MD scrimmage against each other . This second bubble likely MD take place in September , while the playoffs take place down into Orlando . Not every team is fully on board . The eight teams had been concerned that VBG from March to December without meaningful games — while the other 22 teams had training camps and played at least eight games — MD put the development of their young players and cultures behind . Teams pushed for practices and some organized games , although some franchises have pushed harder than others .

Larry Edwards is standing in a subterranean chamber , his headlamp illuminating a series of mineral formations . From the cathedral - IN ceiling dangle tubes VBN as soda straws . Along a waist - high ledge squats a trio of stout stalagmites , their surfaces slick with ecru-colored ooze . “ Now that ’s the kind of thing we might be interested in , ” Edwards VBZ , bending to peer at CD . I hear the plink , plink , plink of falling droplets . PRP hits the top of a stalagmite , then spreads out , laying down a thin film of the mineral calcium carbonate , or calcite , from rainwater seeping though limestone . Drop by drop the stalagmite has grown to its present height — about 18 inches — over who knows how JJ centuries . Edwards , a geochemist at the NNP of Minnesota and a pioneer in the use of cave formations to document ancient NN , is not planning to collect stalagmites today . But CD specimens severed from their moorings when the owner of the cave complex , Spring Valley Caverns , opened a deeper passageway recently provided Edwards and his colleagues with a record of extreme rainfall events over the past 3,000 NNS . Edwards wonders if some of Spring Valley ’s stalagmites MD contain older records still , dating back to when giant glaciers covered much of the Northern Hemisphere or RB to CD of the distant warm periods , or interglacials , that punctuated the NN age NN . A short NN later , we retrace our steps , navigating the sequence of walkways and ladders that leads to the cave ’s entrance . As we step into the light , Edwards turns to me . “ Do you notice all the sounds , all the smells ? ” he VBZ . “ When you come up , they seem so pronounced . ” Edwards , renowned among paleoclimatologists for his cave findings , is n’t much of a spelunker . “ It ’s not that I ’m claustrophobic , ” he VBZ with a shrug , “ I just VBP it better up here . ” To Edwards , a stalagmite is more than a chunk of geology that looks IN a modern sculpture : It ’s a collection of NN sensors , rather IN tree rings but extending often hundreds of thousands of NNS back in NN . Perhaps the only other earthly archives that have provided such a high - resolution portrait of the past half - CD NNS are NN cores . But unlike NN , caves can be VBN all over the NN . “ I MD VB so far as to VB that these are among the most important paleoclimate records we have , ” David Battisti , a NNP of NNP atmospheric scientist , VBZ of the cave NNS . From Edwards ’ lab is emerging a high - resolution picture of precipitation patterns RB ago . Just as important , his work is providing the scientific community with an increasingly precise NN scale , CD that is bringing other records into alignment . Edwards and his colleagues have VBN cave formations to tighten up the timing for ancient rises in NN dioxide locked into Antarctica ’s NN . They ’ve RB VBN them to date skeletal remains that trace JJ migration routes . Why should we care about what happened so RB ago ? A reason can be VBN in the mounting nervousness over the consequences of JJ NN . With heat - trapping NN dioxide in the atmosphere already reaching levels not seen for at least 800,000 NNS , NNS IN Edwards worry that NN patterns MD undergo sudden , destabilizing NNS . NN cores from Greenland , for instance , reveal a sequence of abrupt NN oscillations over the past 140,000 NNS , with severe cold snaps leavened by a series of sudden , if ephemeral , warmings . Eerily similar oscillations are now showing up in the precipitation records from caves . In a landmark NN , Edwards and his collaborators compared the precipitation swings captured by Hulu Cave on the outskirts of Nanjing , NNP , with NNS encoded by Greenland ’s NN . Plotted as graphs , and positioned side by side , the dips and valleys in both records are sharp and — for the 60,000 - NN period covered by the stalagmites — synchronous ."

The US NN agency 's Solar Dynamics Observatory ( SDO ) recently spotted the largest flare to come from the NNP since October 2017 . A solar flare is a flash of radiation from sunspots , cooler patches on the NNP 's NN . NNP has RB observed more of these sunspots and thinks the giant star MD be about to enter a JJ cycle . The NNP actually has an 11 NN cycle and increased activity hints it MD be moving towards a more active stage . However , the strong solar flare spotted recently posed no threat to NNP and was n't heading in our direction . NNP VBD the flare was RB not strong enough to alert NNS at the NNP NNP Prediction Center . We 've had a few months of very little solar activity so astronomers have been keeping their eye on the NNP to VB what happens next . NNP VBZ we wo n't VB whether the JJ sunspots indicate increased activity for a JJ more months . The NN agency VBD : "" It takes at least six months of solar observations and sunspot - counting after a minimum to VB when it 's occurred . "" Because that minimum is defined by the lowest number of sunspots in a cycle , NNS VBP to VB the numbers consistently rising before they can determine when exactly they were at the bottom . "" It can take 12 months to confirm minimum solar activity , by which point the NNP should be out of that part of the cycle . The Sun's 11 NN cycle sees activity and sunspots rise and fall in number . The latest solar flares , detected on NNP 29 , were categorised as as M - class solar flares . This means they came from JJ sunspots . The M RB stands for ' medium ' as all solar flares are classified into A , B , C , M or X categories , depending on how powerful they are . If an M - class solar flare was to impact NNP it MD VB blackouts across the polar regions and JJ radiation storms . In other NN NN , the highest - ever resolution photos of the NNP were published RB earlier this NN . A SpaceX rocket launched CD US astronauts into orbit over the weekend .

At JJ glance , the flick seems to be CD of those generic , God-awful teen movies . However , a closer look reveals how its overall tone and message are in sharp contrast to stereotypes of the genre . “ Josie and the Pussycats ” is indeed an acerbic critique of a morally bankrupt music industry . The most surprising thing about this 2001 movie is its frighteningly accurate predictions regarding today ’s pop music and its Illuminati agenda : NN controlled artists , hypnotized masses , subliminal messages … it ’s all there . This article will examine the movie ’s themes and their relation to today ’s music business context . Josie and the Pussycats was released in 2001 by Universal . In music industry terms , 2001 is ancient history . Just to put you back in the context of the era : N’Sync were still singing Bye Bye Bye , Cisco wanted to VB your thong and everybody was wondering Who Let the Dogs Out . Teens were VBG crazy for boy bands IN the Backstreet Boys and everybody was dancing to Ja Rule . So , yes , it was a JJ NN ago . Josie and the Pussycats came out during that period , but it seems to foretell the death of the era . The movie starts with members of the boy band “ Du Jour , ” a spoof on the Backstreet Boys , dying in a forced plane crash . The group is then replaced by a girl band with a semi- punky attitude and non-threatening pop rock music . This pretty much reflects what actually happened in the NNS following the release of this movie : N’Sync and the Backstreet Boys disappeared from the preteen music NN and were replaced by Miley Cyrus , Hilary Duff , the Jonas Brothers , and so on . Despite the movie ’s apparent lightheartedness , it displays a harsh and sustained judgment of the music business . It is RB severely critical of the NN of NNP ’s youth . Teens and preteens are constantly depicted as a herd of brainless drones who are incapable of independent thinking and prone to hysteria . But behind the usual “ OMG these JJ corporations are so corporation - y ” criticism , Josie and the Pussycats tackles , in an odd and humorous NN , some of the darker sides of the music industry . These include the NN NN of the masses and entertainers and RB the assassination of artists who rebel or ask too JJ questions . The Boy Band That Knew Too Much As stated above , the movie starts with Du Jour ( the boy band “ of the day ” ) enjoying their enormous success . In their private jet , the vain and half - witted group of singers complain about petty things to their record executive Wyatt , who acts more IN a legal guardian . Or , in NN NN terms , a handler . The band then asks Wyatt about strange sounds they heard in the acapella tracks of their latest song … and they VBP some answers . Wyatt ’s answer is quite extreme : He straps on a parachute and jumps off the plane , leaving Du Jour to die in what NN will refer to an “ accidental ” plane crash . This has actually happened in reality numerous times . Artists who start uncovering the darker side of the entertainment business , who ask too JJ questions , or worse , who plan to reveal these things to the NN , are often dropped , publicly humiliated and scorned . And , as in Du Jour ’s NN , they are RB sometimes killed for displaying such behavior . Du Jour was signed with the NN ’s biggest record label , Mega Records . We soon learn that the NN is much more than a record label . Mega Records is , in fact , “ in business ” with the JJ NN and the FBI to brainwash the “ most influential demographic in the entire population ” : the youth . While giving a tour of the label ’s headquarters to visitors from foreign NNS ( who are there to learn how it ’s done ) , Fiona , the eccentric CEO of Mega Records , has this to VB : Fiona ’s office then turns into an elevator and starts descending into a secret underground facility . The label ’s headquarters is , in fact , a NN center for manipulating the minds of the JJ youth . It creates JJ fads , decides everything from “ what clothes are in style to what slang is in vogue , ” with the ultimate goal of making the youth continually spend NN on CD temporary trend after another . Reality is , of course , more complex than that . Trends are ( probably ) not created in an underground NN center in NNP NNP City . There is , however , truth in this near - cartoonish depiction of the music business . The entertainment industry is indeed connected to “ higher powers ” ( as personified in the movie by the FBI agent ) in order to sell the youth on the JJ elite ’s agenda . Popular culture not only attempts to sell NNS and brands to the audience but RB ideas , values , and attitudes . In previous articles on the Vigilant Citizen , we have established that today ’s agenda focuses on concepts such as transhumanism , Illuminati symbolism , premature sexualization , NN NN / militarization , and so forth . Fiona then explains that her label inserts subliminal messages in pop music in order to manipulate the youth into buying NNS and ideas . The label thus goes beyond the simple advertising of NNS . It conceals hidden messages in the music that bypass the audience ’s conscious minds in order to directly reach their subconscious . After the presentation , a foreigner asks Fiona “ How can you VB the rock bands ? What if CD of them discovers you are placing hidden messages in their music ? ” This is what she answers : There are numerous real - NN examples of celebrities who have been silenced , CD of the most shocking and evident being Michael Jackson . After decades of being controlled by the entertainment business , he attempted to break free in the late 90s . He RB spoke out about it . He then endured NNS of scandals , trials , JJ ridicule and financial difficulties . Michael Jackson still managed to keep singing and dancing , RB organizing a NN tour for 2010 . Since previous attempts to destroy him failed , MJ got silenced … by force . So , it MD seem that ten NNS after the release of this movie , shady celebrity sacrifices are still happening . In an attempt to “ take things to the next level , ” Mega Records develops a JJ technology called “ 3DX Surround Sound . ” This JJ technology “ makes the music feel IN it is happening all IN you . ” All the kids who attend Josie and the Pussycat concerts or watch them on TV have to purchase this headgear in order to hear the music . Back in real NN , we are seeing the commercialization of a very similar technology … Josie and the Pussycats : From Nobodies to Sex Kittens Programming Stars After the killing of Du Jour , record exec Wyatt is instructed to find a JJ band as soon as possible . The movie makes it clear that talent is absolutely irrelevant . The label just needs a good - looking group and it will take care of the rest . Then we are introduced to The Pussycats … and their lack of fans . The rock band comprises three young ladies who wear leopard ears as a prop . It is quite obvious that nobody wants to hear their music and RB their manager Alexander does n’t seem to VB it . After hearing about Du Jour ’s plane crash on television , The Pussycats leader , Josie , is motivated to “ VB out there ” and obtain a record contract . At the same NN , Wyatt is driving RB in the JJ town of Riverdale , looking for a band to sign . Then it happens . Wyatt sits down with the girls and tells them how happy he is “ to be sitting down with The Pussyhats . ” He obviously knows nothing about the band and does not care . He then offers them a record contract with Mega Records . Josie wonders briefly why her band is being offered a contract by a label that did not RB hear them play . However , her hunger for fame dispels all her doubts and the band signs the contract . The Pussycats ’ story is classic : A broke , struggling band attempts to become JJ by performing gigs ; a record label offers a shady contract ; the desperate and fame - hungry band signs , not knowing what they are getting into . For the band , it ’s either taking a chance and signing the contract or VBG back to eating Ramen noodles in a crappy apartment . So , they sign the contract . RB after they sign , the label subjects the group to a complete metamorphosis : a make - over to “ sexy them up , ” and a name NN , from The Pussycats to Josie and the Pussycats . The group is now completely owned by the label . It has lost NN of its image , its name , and RB its music , as it has been modified to contain subliminal messages . But those NNS pay off , as they become a # 1 band in less than a week . The movie RB contains numerous references to NN NN programming . As stated in previous articles , numerous celebrities have been subjected to NN NN in order for them to become more easily manageable by their handlers . In bolder words , they become slaves of the industry . Monarch NN NN includes numerous types of programming , CD of them being Beta ( or Sex Kitten programming ) . It is the type of programming that is the most VBN in the entertainment industry and it is coded with references to “ cats , ” “ kitties , ” “ pussycats , ” and RB with the wearing of feline print clothing . This might explain why the producers chose to base the girl band on the Archie Comic of the same name . The symbolism was just too perfect . So , in less than a week , with the NN of subliminal messaging , the group produces a # 1 hit and sells out a huge concert . The group RB earns the honor of meeting the label ’s CEO , Fiona . The girls soon realize that Fiona acts in a strange , dissociative matter as if she were herself under some sort of NN NN . After the meeting , Fiona spies on the group VBG hidden cameras and learns that CD members of the group , Melody , and Valerie , are creeped out by her and JJ - out do not trust her . So she decides to VB with another tactic we often VBP in the music business : to keep the star of the group and drop the other band members . In order to carry out this operation , the label proceeds to use NN NN on Josie by making her listen to subliminal messages in her own music . The process completely VBZ her attitude and personality : Josie turns from a sweet and down - to - NN girl into an attention - hungry diva who is convinced that her friends are worthless . This scene subtly describes the hidden , NN NN aspect that happens in the music business : label execs use NN NN programming to create an alter persona in Josie , which they can VB and manage at will . Fortunately , Josie manages to snap out of her hypnotic NN and learns everything about the 3D , mass NN NN concert . Unfortunately , her bandmates Melody and Valerie have been kidnapped by the label and Josie must perform in the NN NN concert to avoid the “ accidental killing ” of her friends . I will spare you the details of the ending , but I can tell you that it involves catfights and the girls playing generic pop rock in front of a crowd that has learned to VB for itself . Thank you , Josie ! The least we can VB is that Josie and the Pussycats is an odd movie . It strongly criticizes some aspects of the entertainment business while perpetuating more of the same . CD example of this paradoxical situation is the ridiculous amount of product placements in the movie . Some of those placements are pretty hilarious ( VB the box of Tide above ) , but in the end , they too perpetuate the NN ideology . Imagine me repeatedly punching someone in the face . Then when asked to stop , imagine me replying : “ Ca n’t you VB that I ’m pushing this face punching to an absurd level ? You ’re obviously not getting the brilliant second - degree message here , I ’m actually denouncing violence ! So sit there and VB about violence in society while I keep pounding this guy ’s face . ” Despite what is being VBN , the fact remains that pounding someone in the face is itself perpetuating violence … and this movie keeps punching the viewers in the face with product placements . In fact , the entire movie ’s message gives the same odd feeling . Its clever “ behind - the - scenes ” look at the music industry makes the viewers feel they ’re “ in on the joke , ” making them comfortable enough to let their guard down . However , at the end of the day , the young viewers are still the butt of the joke : all of the sleazy and gimmicky tactics are being VBN on real - NN viewers in order to sell them NN controlling music . Furthermore , the movie fictionalizes some of the darker aspects of the entertainment business , for example by making NN controlled artists something that PRP can “ only VB in the movies . ” At the end of the film , Mega Records ’ mass hypnosis plans are uncovered , and the FBI ( who funded the project ) immediately attempts to dissociate from the label , RB arresting Fiona “ on charges of NN against the youth of NNP . ” The agent then privately VBZ to Fiona : “ We were shutting down your entire project anyways … we VBD out that subliminal messages work much better in movies ! ” This is the movie ’s NN of saying that RB though it has let you in on the joke , the movie is still part of the plans . In other words , the biggest joke in the movie… is you ."

The_DT Italian_JJ Renaissance_NNP was_VBD over_RB ._.","Toward the end of the 14th century A.D. , a handful of Italian thinkers declared that they were living in a JJ age . The barbarous , unenlightened “ Middle Ages ” were over , they VBD ; the JJ age MD be a “ rinascità ” ( “ rebirth ” ) of learning and literature , art and culture . This was the birth of the period now VBN as the Renaissance . For centuries , scholars have agreed that the Italian Renaissance ( another word for “ rebirth ” ) happened just that NN : that between the 14th century and the 17th century , a JJ , modern NN of thinking about the NN and NN ’s place in it replaced an old , backward NN . In fact , the Renaissance ( in Italy and in other parts of Europe ) was considerably more complicated than that : For CD thing , in JJ ways the period we call the Renaissance was not so JJ from the era that preceded it . However , JJ of the scientific , artistic and cultural achievements of the so - called Renaissance do share common themes , most notably the humanistic belief that NN was the center of his own universe . Fifteenth - century Italy was unlike any other place in Europe . It was divided into independent city - NNS , each with a JJ form of NN . Florence , where the Italian Renaissance began , was an independent republic . It was RB a banking and commercial capital and , after London and Constantinople , the third - largest city in Europe . Wealthy Florentines flaunted their NN and NN by becoming patrons , or supporters , of artists and intellectuals . In this NN , the city became the cultural center of Europe and of the Renaissance . The NNP Humanism : Cornerstone of the Renaissance Thanks to the patronage of these wealthy elites , Renaissance - era writers and thinkers were able to spend their days doing just that . Instead of devoting themselves to ordinary jobs or to the asceticism of the monastery , they MD enjoy worldly pleasures . They traveled IN Italy , studying ancient ruins and rediscovering Greek and Roman texts . To Renaissance scholars and philosophers , these classical sources from Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome held great wisdom . Their secularism , their appreciation of physical beauty and especially their emphasis on NN ’s achievements and expression formed the governing intellectual principle of the Italian Renaissance . This philosophy is VBN as “ humanism . ” Humanism encouraged NNS to be curious and to question received wisdom ( particularly that of the medieval Church ) . It RB encouraged NNS to use experimentation and observation to solve earthly problems . As a result , JJ Renaissance intellectuals focused on trying to define and understand the laws of nature and the physical NN . For example , Renaissance artist Leonardo Da Vinci created detailed scientific “ studies ” of objects ranging from flying machines to submarines . He RB created pioneering studies of JJ anatomy . Likewise , the scientist and mathematician Galileo Galilei investigated CD natural law after another . By dropping JJ - sized cannonballs from the top of a building , for instance , he proved that all objects fall at the same rate of acceleration . He RB built a powerful telescope and VBD it to show that the NNP and other planets revolved IN the NN and not , as religious authorities argued , the other NN RB . ( For this , Galileo was arrested for heresy and threatened with torture and death , but he refused to recant : “ I do not VB that the same NNP who has endowed us with senses , reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use , ” he VBD . ) However , perhaps the most important technological development of the Renaissance happened not in Italy but in Germany , where Johannes Gutenberg invented the mechanical movable - type printing press in the middle of the 15th century . For the JJ NN , it was possible to make books–and , by extension , knowledge–widely available . Michelangelo ’s “ David . ” Leonardo da Vinci ’s “ The Last Supper . ” Sandro Boticelli’s “ The Birth of Venus . ” During the Italian Renaissance , art was everywhere ( just look up at Michelangelo ’s “ The Last Judgment ” painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel ! ) . Patrons such as Florence ’s Medici family sponsored projects JJ and JJ , and successful artists became celebrities in their own NN . Renaissance artists and architects applied JJ humanist principles to their work . For example , the architect Filippo Brunelleschi applied the elements of classical Roman architecture–shapes , columns and especially proportion –to his own buildings . The magnificent eight - sided dome he built at the Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral in Florence was an engineering triumph–it was 144 NNS across , weighed 37,000 tons and had no buttresses to hold it up–as well as an aesthetic NN . Brunelleschi RB devised a NN to draw and paint VBG linear perspective . That is , he figured out how to paint from the perspective of the person looking at the painting , so that NN MD appear to recede into the frame . After the architect Leon Battista Alberti explained the principles behind linear perspective in his treatise “ Della Pittura ” ( “ On Painting ” ) , it became CD of the most noteworthy elements of almost all Renaissance painting . Later , JJ painters began to use a technique called chiaroscuro to create an illusion of three - dimensional NN on a JJ canvas . Fra Angelico , the painter of frescoes in the church and friary of San Marco in Florence , was called “ a rare and perfect talent ” by the Italian painter and architect Vasari in his “ Lives of The Artists . ” Renaissance painters IN Raphael , Titian and Giotto and Renaissance sculptors IN Donatello and Lorenzo Ghiberti created art that MD inspire generations of future artists . The End of the Italian Renaissance By the end of the 15th century , Italy was being torn apart by CD NN after another . The kings of England , France and Spain , along with the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor , battled for NN of the wealthy peninsula . At the same NN , the Catholic Church , which was itself wracked with scandal and corruption , had begun a violent crackdown on dissenters . In 1545 , the Council of Trent officially established the Roman Inquisition . In this NN , humanism was akin to heresy . The Italian Renaissance was over ."

MRI scans of CD NNS with VBN cortical atrophy caused by hypoxic–ischaemic encephalopathy sustained during term delivery were selected alongside 8 age - matched controls who had normal MRI findings . The research was approved by the NNP of Bristol Ethics Committee ( NN reference 27741 ) and has been performed in accordance with the ethics standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments . We selected NNS from T1 - weighted 3 - D turbo spin-echo or 3 - D fluid - attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR ) imaging . VBG the 3 - D curved MPR function in OsiriX , multiple curved reformatting techniques were tested , then formalised and standardised . We performed reconstructions from all three planes ( coronal , sagittal and axial ) VBG JJ landmark slices ( e.g. , foramen of Monro , pineal gland ) , angles of reconstruction ( e.g. , following the course of the Sylvian fissure , central sulcus ) and at various depths to the cortical NN . CD images ( CD reconstructed from the coronal plane and CD from the sagittal plane ) were determined to give the best overview of the cortical regions most frequently damaged in hypoxic–ischaemic encephalopathy sustained at term delivery ( i.e. the watershed zones , and perisylvian and perirolandic regions ) . We describe an optimal method for creating these reconstructions . For reconstructions from the coronal 3 - D T1 - weighted NN set , the slice demonstrating the foramina of Monro is selected for generating the JJ - NN map . The pathway for generating the curved reconstructions is plotted 1 - cm deep to the NN of the brain by depositing cursors at 12 landmarks ( 6 on either side of the midline ) as described in Fig. 1 . The resultant image has been likened to a Mercator map of the NN [ 3 , 4 ] . For reconstructions from the sagittal 3 - D T1 - weighted NNS , the landmark midline slice demonstrating the aqueduct of Sylvius is selected . The pathway for generating the curved reconstructions is plotted 1 - cm deep to the cortical NN by depositing cursors at 8 points starting anteriorly and ending posteriorly as described in Fig. 1 . The resultant image derived from sagittal images is likened to unrolling a scroll . The cerebral sulcal anatomy of NNS in the NN group from the Mercator brain maps was identified VBG work by Wagner FW FW . [ 4 ] . No equivalent anatomical work exists for scroll brain maps , and the sulcal anatomy was identified de novo from an JJ anatomy atlas [ 5 ] . The sulcal anatomy and expected regions of abnormality were then plotted on the Mercator and scroll maps in CD of the NN patients as a reference source ( Fig. 2 ) . JJ - NN maps ( Mercator and scroll projections ) of the brain were then generated for CD NNS with previous hypoxic–ischaemic encephalopathy . These were displayed alongside those of age - matched healthy controls for comparison . CD readers ( S.A. , a paediatric radiologist with 15 NNS ’ experience in neuroimaging , and E.S. , a 5th - NN radiology trainee ) assessed each JJ - NN map for the presence of ( 1 ) widening of the Sylvian fissure ; ( 2 ) widening of the longitudinal fissure , noting whether such widening was localised ( indicating regional watershed - zone , or perisylvian or perirolandic volume loss ) or generalised ; ( 3 ) cortical atrophy in characteristic locations ( perirolandic , perisylvian or watershed distribution ) , and ( 4 ) ulegyria . Discrepancies were arbitrated by a third reader ( A.C. , a qualified general radiologist 3 NNS post completion of training ) . No abnormal features were identified on any of the eight controls ( mean age 3 NNS 11 months ; 5 boys , 3 girls ) . The abnormal findings that were visible in NNS with hypoxic–ischaemic encephalopathy sustained at term delivery ( mean age 3 NNS 6 months ; 6 boys , 4 girls ) are shown in Table 1 . The JJ - NN map generated by the curved reconstruction displays the structures along a region adjacent to the plotted path at the expense of structures at the extremes of the axis perpendicular to that path ; CD maps are generated from perpendicular curved lines , so JJ structures are seen optimally on each map . The following general observations were made : • The perisylvian and perirolandic regions were better demonstrated on the Mercator maps . The scroll maps demonstrated the lateral structures poorly . • More of the frontal lobe anatomy was seen consistently on the Mercator maps . • The central posterior parietal and occipital lobes were better demonstrated on the scroll maps . • Watershed zones were well demonstrated on both Mercator and scroll maps . The following observations were made from review of JJ - NN maps in NNS who sustained hypoxic–ischaemic injury at term delivery : • Widening of the longitudinal fissure was seen on all abnormal NNS on Mercator and scroll maps , consistent with parasagittal / parafalcine watershed atrophy . In 9 of CD instances there was a localised biconvex separation of the hemispheres distinct from the parallel separation of the hemispheres elsewhere ( Figs. 3 and 4 ) . • Damage to intervascular watershed zones was well seen on both Mercator and scroll maps ( anterior watershed zones were better demonstrated on Mercator map and posterior watershed regions on the scroll maps ) and was noted in a continuous band - IN fashion ( as opposed to a wedge of abnormality ) ( Fig. 4 ) . • Perirolandic and perisylvian damage was better demonstrated on Mercator maps ( Figs. 3 and 4 ) . • Ulegyria was identified in 7 of CD of NNS of hypoxic–ischaemic encephalopathy ( Figs. 3 and 4 , Table 1 ) ."

While prepping the citizenry for coming and required “ certifications ” , the deliberate and violent contraction of the NN continues . The decimation of small enterprise with monetary wealth directed , again , upward . McDonald ’s , Starbucks and Walmart ( “ essential services ” ) remain open while small business is forced to remain closed .

They expect a 5 % to 9 % return on investment in just the JJ NN ; in 2019 they expect this return to balloon to double digits . ” “ And this is only CD sector : PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that 38 % of US jobs will be in danger of being replaced by automation by 2030 . ” “ NNS that automate their workforces should be taxed on these JJ massive profits , and some of the resulting capital given back to workers by the NN in the form of UBI . ” “ While the idea of a UBI is popular — Mark Zuckerberg , Elon Musk , and Bill NNP have all championed it — how exactly MD a universal basic income be engineered ? “ JJ swaths of laborers are VBG to lose their jobs , leading to unprecedented levels of unemployment . ” March 18 2020 : Over 500 academics and JJ figures called on governments to implement universal basic income via an open letter : “ It is NN for governments to enact emergency universal basic income , ensuring that everyone in their jurisdiction has enough NN to buy the food and other essentials they need to survive . ” McKinsey places the number of jobs to be replaced by automation at close to 50 % by 2030 . The NNP - CD NN provides an opportune moment to push the envelope of automation forward .

With most schools set to remain closed through the rest of the current academic NN , the scale of these closures is unprecedented in the history of NN capitalism . ” We must recognize we live in a capitalist JJ NN that serves capital RB & foremost . Further , it is imperative to recognize that the UN & UN agencies , inclusive of the WHO ( WEF / NNPS ) , exist in name only . The WEF is at the helm of a consolidation of JJ NN .

The feigned concern for NN and biodiversity by those that serve them , is , to be blunt , complete bullshit . There is nothing to be VBN within the Fourth Industrial Revolution dystopia in regard to nature – other than her financialization and objectification . She too will be placed on the blockchain . Here , NN ’s arrogance is on full display – with plans to cover the NNP ’s NN with artificial forests and drone bees , while cordoning off what they have not yet plundered – for their own personal leisure .

Notorious fraudster Johann Hari is now touting the UBI scam as an “ anti- depressant . ” [ @cordeliers on NNP ] “ Subsidizing low - wage work depresses wages by essentially allowing employers to pay less than a livable wage , so EITC - type benefits are at least in part a transfer to employers , rather than workers . ” April 3 , 2020 , The Wall Street Journal : “ Henry Kissinger – The NNP NNP Will Forever Alter the NN Order ” : “ Basic Income , when all is VBN and done , is a vision for nothing more than the means to be a customer in an unjust society that decides what is for sale . ” “ It ’s RB about the commodification of JJ provision . Your payment MD actually be less conditional and somewhat larger but , as you shop through the privatized remains of the JJ infrastructure , with inadequate means and very few rights , you are dramatically worse off … … it is sometimes asserted that an adequate NN of provision must be put in place simply because we are moving toward a “ workless future . ” In such a society , it is suggested , masses of NNS who have been displaced will have to be provided for and the capitalists will have to VB IN Elon Musk , of Tesla Motors and support BI because it is the only sensible and rational solution . To imagine such responsible provision for the future is to place undue faith in a NN VBN on the making of profit . If they wo n’t stop building pipelines in the face of JJ catastrophe , there ’s little reason to expect them to worry too much about sensible solutions to technological displacement . There simply is no post - capitalist capitalism and no JJ policy innovation that is VBG to bring it about … I am suggesting that our movements need to challenge , rather than come to terms with , the neoliberal order and the capitalist NN that has produced it . For all its claims to be a sweeping measure , the notion of progressive BI is a futile attempt to VB peace with that NN . In reality , RB that compromise is not available . The NN of BI that governments are working on in their JJ policy laboratories will not ‘ end the tyranny of the labour NN ’ but render it more dreadful . The agenda of austerity and privatization requires a NN of income support that renders NNS as powerless and desperate as possible in the face of exploitation and that wo n’t VB if it is relabelled as “ Basic Income ” . ” When we all start to literally starve ( some already have , and JJ more have been for decades ) , perhaps then – we will eat the rich . The question is this ? Do you still VB that these NNS actually give a flying fuck about your NN ? The Fourth Industrial Revolution cannot come into fruition without the 5G infrastructure that will run the Internet of Things . “ Smart ” cities must be understood within the context of JJ policing and the JJ industrial complex .

Misinformation and fear are some of the biggest reasons NNS are refusing to VB their kids vaccinated . Getty Images Rebekah Ficco was terrified of NNS . She experienced a miscarriage with her JJ pregnancy , and when she was able to VB pregnant again , she was determined to protect her baby . “ I did n’t VB to do anything to jeopardize this , so I poured into reading , ” Ficco told Healthline . “ And when you ’re a JJ parent , you come across all this information . And I just started seeing more and more about NNS . ” For Ficco , there was nothing scarier than the thought of losing her child . And when she read about accounts on the NNP Adverse Event Reporting NNP ( VAERS ) of NNS dying of SIDS shortly after their vaccinations , she panicked . “ I had experienced just a very minor piece of what it ’s IN to lose a child … but I knew I never wanted to be in their NNS , ” Ficco VBD . Still , she was n’t completely against NNS until after her daughter was born and they went to the JJ pediatrician appointment . “ I had n’t completely decided CD NN or the other , ” she explained , stating that her daughter had n’t received the hepatitis B NN at birth , but did VB the vitamin K shot . When she brought her questions and concerns to her daughter ’s pediatrician , though , the response she received pushed her straight into the anti-vaccination camp . “ The nurse and the NN were both very pushy and judgmental , and it just made me feel IN everything I ’d read must be true . They must be getting paid by JJ pharma . I walked out saying I MD never vaccinate my kids , ” she VBD . Ficco ’s initial hesitation to vaccinate her child is n’t uncommon . In fact , experts VBP more than 60 percent of JJ NNS feel this NN . L.J. Tan , chief strategy officer of the Immunization Action Coalition ( IAC ) , told Healthline , “ When we talk to NNS about NNS , they RB fall into three categories . RB you have the folks IN myself — 20 to 30 percent of NNS who are vaccinating because they VBP in the NN . ” Conversely , he explained there are then 5 to 10 percent of NNS who are so resistant to NNS , nothing anyone VBZ will ever VB their minds . “ But then there ’s the JJ group in the middle , the 60 percent who are hesitant but who we VBP to try to educate , ” he VBD . Ficco was initially CD of those . And had it not been for how that JJ NN ’s appointment went , it ’s possible she MD have been convinced to vaccinate her NNS entirely on schedule . How doctors talk to NNS about NNS Healthline spoke to 20 NNS who fall into that NN - hesitant 60 percent . We asked them to explain their concerns and to bring us their questions . The surprising result was that no CD NNS had the exact same concerns . JJ were worried about unique family histories , or random connections they ’d read about RB . According to Tan , this is true of NN - hesitant NNS in general . While JJ might VB this group has fallen victim to the debunked research of — avoiding NNS simply out of fear of a now - disproven link to NN — most of the NNS we spoke with never mentioned that as an actual concern . Instead , they all had their own worries when it came to the NNS meant to protect their NNS . “ It often becomes a NN by NN and parent by parent conversation , ” Tan explained . “ That ’s why it ’s a hard conversation for doctors . ” But with pediatricians often serving as the front line in addressing these concerns , finding a NN to do so without pushing scared NNS away is crucial to ensuring the factual information gets out there . That ’s part of what Tan advocates for through the IAC . “ What we ’re trying to do is give physicians room to answer those questions confidently , and to ease those concerns , giving them the tools to address specific questions , ” he VBD . Of the NNS that spoke with Healthline , JJ VBD they became concerned about vaccinations after reading reports on VAERS . NNS read about NNS of adverse reactions and VBD they determined for themselves that that was proof NNS posed a NN NN . The problem with this conclusion is that VAERS is a passive reporting NN , according to Tan . “ We encourage everyone who thinks they MD have had any reaction to a NN at all , whether it ’s causal or not , to report it to VAERS so that we can then VB any possible links , ” he VBD . But that means that JJ of the reports MD not actually be linked to the NN . In fact , Tan told CD story of a VAERS report where a JJ woman had died after receiving the JJ papillomavirus ( HPV ) NN . The problem ? She died in a car accident — information that was only VBN after further investigating the report . Several NNS that spoke with Healthline RB brought up concerns about the Gardasil NN , which has been VBN to prevent cervical cancer , saying it had n’t been RB RB enough or tested thoroughly enough for them to feel it ’s safe . But Dr. Sean O’Leary , spokesperson and chair of the NNP Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious NNS , explained that simply is n’t the NN . “ More than 100 CD doses have been given in the last 15 NNS . It ’s CD of the best studied NNS we have in terms of safety because it has been studied in response to some of the unfounded concerns , and we VBP that it ’s very safe and very effective , ” he VBD . Another concern NNS voiced was the idea of overloading NNS ’s immune systems with too JJ NNS at once . Several had opted for alternative NN schedules in order to avoid this . But as Dr. O’Leary explained , “ The immune NN responds to thousands of things every day , so the amount of proteins that it responds to in a NN is a drop in the bucket . ” Tan agreed , pointing out that NNS have a bigger immune response to things IN scraping their knee , playing in the mud , or RB eating the food their NNS prepare for them than they do to NNS . “ You are being exposed to far more antigens in your daily NN than you are from NNS , ” he explained . “ In the past , NNS MD have had a lot of antigens — the smallpox NN is a good example . But our current NNS are very finite and controlled , and as our technology has improved , the amount of antigens you VBP from a NN now is very small . ” This is part of the reason both experts strongly advocate for vaccinating on schedule . O’Leary explained that it ’s important to VB JJ NNS their NNS as early as possible , because JJ of these NNS are more severe for younger NNS . “ RB , it ’s kind of torture , ” he VBD in reference to extended NN schedules . “ Infants feel NN with three shots or CD in a similar fashion , that ’s been studied using biomarkers . When you spread them out , you ’re subjecting them to multiple different painful episodes instead of just CD . ” That was the realization Ficco eventually came to . “ The NN is that I was terrified , ” she VBD . “ The misinformation out there struck me RB in my terrified JJ - mama heart . ” It was n’t until her sister - in - law started an anti-vaccine blog that Ficco began to reconsider her own position on NNS . “ NNS were taking her advice and opinion as fact and that RB slapped me in the face . I realized I had been reading and making choices for my kids VBN basically on her blog , just from different NNS with different platforms , ” Ficco VBD . Once that realization hit , IN the NN her oldest daughter was nearly 3 and her youngest was 6 months , she took them to the pediatrician to begin getting their vaccinations . “ My girls have recently been completely caught up , ” she VBD proudly . Today , Ficco VBD her biggest regret is that she allowed her earlier choices about vaccinations to be guided by fear instead of NN . “ The biggest thing I ’ve learned in this journey is that correlation does not equal causation , and to RB consider the source of what you ’re reading before you take anything as fact , ” she VBD ."

The_DT findings_NNS were_VBD published_VBN today_NN (_-LRB- Feb._NNP 19_CD )_-RRB- in_IN the_DT journal_NN ._.","NNS worldwide are racing to develop potential NNS and drugs to fight the JJ NN , called NNP - NNP - 2 . Now , a group of NNS has figured out the molecular structure of a key NN that the uses to invade JJ NNS , potentially opening the door to the NN of a NN , according to JJ findings . Previous research revealed that coronaviruses invade NNS through so - called "" spike "" proteins , but those proteins take on different shapes in different coronaviruses . Figuring out the NN of the spike NN in NNP - NNP - 2 is the key to figuring out how to target the NN , VBD Jason McLellan , senior author of the NN and an associate professor of molecular biosciences at the NNP of Texas at Austin . Though the NN uses JJ different proteins to replicate and invade NNS , the spike NN is the major NN NN that it uses to bind to a receptor — another NN that acts IN a doorway into a JJ NN . After the spike NN binds to the JJ NN receptor , the viral membrane fuses with the JJ NN membrane , allowing the genome of the NN to enter JJ NNS and begin infection . So "" if you can prevent attachment and fusion , you will prevent entry , "" McLellan told Live NNP . But to target this NN , you need to VB what it looks IN . Related : VBG viral : 6 JJ findings about viruses Earlier this month , NNS of NNP - NNP - 2 . Using that genome , McLellan and his NN , in collaboration with the National Institutes of NNP ( NIH ) , identified the specific genes that code for the spike NN . They then sent that gene information to a NN that created the genes and sent them back . The group then injected those genes into mammalian NNS in a lab dish and those NNS produced the spike proteins . Next , using a very detailed microscopy technique called cryogenic electron microscopy , the group created a 3D "" map , "" or "" blueprint , "" of the spike proteins . The blueprint revealed the structure of the molecule , mapping the location of each of its atoms in NN . "" It 's impressive that these NNS were able to VB the structure so quickly , "" VBD Aubree Gordon , an associate professor of epidemiology at the NNP of Michigan who was not a part of the NN . "" It 's a very important step forward and MD VB in the NN of a NN against NN - NN - 2 . "" Stephen Morse , a professor at Columbia NNP 's Mailman School of NNP NNP who was RB not a part of the NN agrees . The spike NN "" MD be the likely choice for rapid NN of NN antigens "" and treatments , he told Live NNP in an email . Knowing the structure MD be "" very helpful in developing NNS and antibodies with good activity , "" as MD producing higher quantities of these proteins , he added . The NN is sending these atomic "" coordinates "" to dozens of research groups IN the NN who are working to develop NNS and drugs to target NNP - NNP - 2 . Meanwhile , McLellan and his NN hope to VB the map of the spike NN as the basis for a . When foreign invaders , such as or , invade the NN , immune NNS fight back by producing proteins called antibodies . These antibodies bind to specific structures on the foreign invader , called the antigen . But producing antibodies can take NN . NNS are dead or weakened antigens that train the immune NN to create these antibodies before the NN is exposed to the NN . In NN , the spike NN itself "" MD be either the NN or variants of a NN , "" McLellan VBD . When you inject this spike - NN - VBN NN , "" NNS MD VB antibodies against the spike , and then if they were ever exposed to the live NN , "" the NN MD be prepared , he added . VBN on previous research they did on other coronaviruses , the NNS introduced mutations , or changes to create a more stable molecule . Indeed , "" the molecule looks RB good ; it 's RB well behaved ; the structure kind of demonstrates that the molecule is stable in the correct confirmation that we were hoping for , "" McLellan VBD . "" So now we and others will VB the molecule that we created as a basis for NN antigen . "" Their colleagues at the NIH will now inject these spike proteins into NNS to VB how well the proteins trigger antibody production . Still , McLellan thinks a NN is likely about 18 to 24 months away . That 's "" still quite fast compared to normal NN NN , which might take UH 10 NNS , "" he VBD . The findings were published today ( Feb. CD ) in the journal ."

[ Note : Some words and / or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words / phrases having no exact counterpart . ] According to this report , with NNP NNP having been surrounded and protected by CD of the largest private mercenary forces ever seen in the US , the NNP - led “ Deep NN ” coup seeking his death , or destruction , to keep him from NN has failed , thus preparing Trumpian forces , aligned with Obama regime deep cover intelligence operatives , to fulfill NNP John F. Kennedy ’s vow to break this corrupt and demonic US spy agency “ into a thousand pieces ” and “ scatter it to wind ” — and that NNP Kennedy was publically executed for attempting , and when NNP Richard Nixon attempted this too , he was ousted in coup . Security Council analysts writing in this report VBP that the Bush - NNP Crime Families have been able to maintain their stranglehold over NNP for nearly 50 NNS due to the trillions - of - dollars they ’ve earned thorough the NNP ’s international NN cartel — but when these NNP - led Bush - NNP forces attacked the NNP NNPS on 11 September 2001 in order to be able to invade Afghanistan , who had completely eradicated their opium production , the Freemason forces led by NNP - Obama had no choice but to respond . With the JJ JJ narcotics experts having gone into Afghanistan in early 2001 , this report notes , they concluded that the Taliban movement 's ban on opium - poppy cultivation had wiped out the NN 's largest crop in less than a NN — but with the NNP ’s 9/11 JJ flag operation being a success , by 2014 opium production in this nation had soared to JJ record highs insuring that these monsters illegal NN operation MD continue to operate . Seeking to insure that their illegal opium and heroin NNS MD , RB , continue without interference , this report grimly details , the Bush - NNP Crime Families , in 2003 , then illegally invaded Iraq in order to open JJ smuggling routes to both Europe and NNP NNP — but when Iraqi forces began to crack down on this NNP - led operation , these monsters then turned to Islamic radicals ( ISIS ) to keep their massive NN operation running . Equally as worse , this report notes , since 2000 , the Bush - NNP - NNP NN empire expanded into Mexico causing a NN that has , so far , killed nearly 250,000 ( US and Mexico deaths ) after their creating what is VBN as the Sinaloa Cartel , described as “ the most powerful NN trafficking organization in the NN ” , and whose alliance with NNP - led DEA factions turned their main NNP NNPS NN distribution center , located in Chicago , into the most deadly city NNP has ever VBN . As to how the Bush - NNP - NNP NN empire has been able to operate so freely these JJ decades , this report explains , is due to the NNP ’s outright purchase of Hillary NNP ’s Democratic Party through illegal NN profits funneled through the “ too JJ to count ” shell corporations set up by the JJ - Hungarian billionaire George Soros , and as the Panama Papers detail fully . Not just the Democratic Party , either , did the Bush - NNP - NNP purchase so they MD continue their JJ crimes , this report continues , but the entire Western NN establishment too — and as revealed by top German reporter Udo Ulfkotte , who this past NN exposed the NNP ’s total NN over all of these mainstream NN organizations , but who was , sadly , assassinated this past week prior to him meeting with NNP NNP . Not being assassinated though , this report notes , is the Bush - NNP - NNP Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaquín Guzmán ( El Chapo ) — who just hours RB was brought to NNP York City by Trumpian forces and their Obama regime allies — and is able to identify the “ NN routes ” of supply from the NNP to the Democratic Party . To the “ main / central ” NNP “ NN route ” of illegal NN profits VBN to buy the US mainstream NN and Democratic Party uncovered by NNP - Obama forces , this report explains , was through the owner of a small Washington D.C. NN NN named James Alefantis ( who was “ bizarrely / strangely ” named as CD of the 50 most powerful NNS in Washington ) and his homosexual lover David Brock — who is CD of the NNP Crime families most feared operatives . Once receiving Bush - NNP - NNP illegal NN profits , this report continues , David Brock dispersed these monies through a secret network overseen by Hillary NNP NN chairman John NNP and his brother Tony NNP — who , in turn , RB funneled NN into the Republican Party through John NNP ’s close personal friend , and convicted “ boy lover ” pedophile Dennis Haster , who was once the leader of the US NNP of Representatives . Most astounding to note in this report about the Brock - Alefantis - NNP - Haster “ NN manipulators ” for the NNP , who have corrupted the US mainstream NN and the Democratic Party too , is that NNP Obama ’s closest personal aide , Ben Rhodes , this past week authorized his CBS NNP NN brother , David Rhodes , to release a shocking television report about these monsters — and that aired RB on the CBS networks flagship station in Atlanta . As this Security Council report has JJ conclusions that are in excess of over 1,700 pages ( the majority of which remain highly classified ) , the fastest summery of it we can relate to you is that : 1. ) Immediately after the 11 September 2001 JJ flag attack on NNP led by the Bush - NNP Crime Families and their NNP - led “ Deep NNP ” allies , JJ Freemasonic forces led by NNP York City billionaire Donald NNP VBD as a JJ “ blocking maneuver ” the elevation of a relatively unknown minor political figure named Barack Obama to become NN and keep Hillary NNP from NN . 2. ) Knowing that leftist Americans MD gravitate towards the charismatic Obama , once taking NN his “ mission / objective ” was to begin the destruction of the Democratic Party — which he succeeded at beyond all expectations . 3. ) RB among Obama ’s “ main / central ” objectives while in NN was keeping the from starting NNP NNP III , while at the same NN insuring that the Democratic Party MD not be able to disarm the JJ NNS . 4. ) Once Obama ’s term was finished , and in a further bid to keep the Bush - NNP Crime Families from taking NN , NNP MD then ascend to NN while , RB , destroying the Republican Party — and who was secretly aided by Obama ’s top political operatives . But to this reports gravest conclusion is that RB though the Freemasonic forces led by NNP - Obama have so far accomplished all of their goals , the outcome of this NN still remains undecided — but to anyone still puzzled as to why Obama received a Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 for having done nothing , it had nothing to do with what he had done , but what his and now NNP NNP were planning to do , stop these monsters once and for all .

Donald NNP , who has RB espoused a debunked link between NNS and NN , was set to enter the White NNP . He met with JJ activist Robert Kennedy Jr. , who has for NNS argued that NNS can VB a range of developmental and other NN conditions . Kennedy emerged to report he ’d been asked to chair a commission into NN safety . But seven months later , no such commission has been appointed and the NN - mired White NNP has declined to VB whether the plan has been shelved . STAT contacted Kennedy to VB where plans stood . He MD only speak on condition that STAT publish the interview in a Q&A format . He argued that his assertions — which are disputed as a misreading of the scientific literature by JJ mainstream NNS — have been misquoted and misrepresented in the NN . Here is STAT ’s conversation with Kennedy . It has been lightly edited , for length and readability . The question I VBP to ask you relates to the NN safety commission that you had announced in January that you were VBG to head , after you met with then NNP - elect NNP . It ’s been a number of months now , and there has n’t been any further JJ announcement . And so we ’ve been wondering : Where does this stand ? I ’ve had no discussions specifically about the NN safety commission , probably since February . I ’ve spoken to the White NNP about other issues of NN safety and had a number of follow - up meetings . Can I ask you who you met with ? Well , I ’ve met with high - level officials in the White NNP . They ’ve arranged meetings for me with HHS and White NNP officials and agency officials . Various agency officials , including [ NIH Director ] Francis Collins and his deputy , Lawrence Tabak , I VBP . And I met with Tony Fauci , who ’s at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious NNPS . Linda Birnbaum , who ’s at the National Institute of NNP NNP Sciences . Diana Bianchi , at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child NNP and NNP NNP at NIH . And over at FDA I ’ve met with Peter Marks , the director of [ the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research ] and some other officials there . I ca n’t remember everybody at this point , all of the NNS that we ’ve met with . And this is since the NN of the administration ? Yeah . The White NNP officials and the HHS officials accompanied me . I did it at their request . At “ their ” request ? Who is they ? So you VBD you ’ve had no discussions since February about the NN safety commission ? Not specifically about the commission . OK . Do you VB that idea is dead ? Or do you VB it ’s in abeyance ? You ’d have to ask the White NNP . It MD be that it ’s evolved . I ’ve been told that the NN is still interested in this issue and that he wants me to have further meetings with the regulatory agencies and with the White NNP . IN I VBD , I have not talked to anybody in the White NNP about the commission . Do you VB there ’s a possibility the commission is VBG ahead but not with you on it ? Again , you ’d have to ask the White NNP . Do you VB to talk about NN safety NN at all ? I have n’t finished asking questions about this . Are you disappointed that so far there has n’t been a commission set up to do what you VBD you were VBG to be doing in January ? The commission was not my idea . I was asked to chair a commission and I agreed that if the commission were created that I MD do that , I MD sit on it . [ But ] that ’s up to the White NNP how they VBP to handle this issue . It was n’t my idea . I am happy with any steps that are taken to VB NNS safer and to improve the scientific integrity IN the process . To reform the process so that NNS are subject to the same kind of safety scrutiny and safety testing that other drugs are subject to . We need to , prior to licensing NNS , we need to do gold standard safety testing , IN every other NN approval requires . We need to do double - blind placebo testing . Because particularly when it comes to injecting aluminum or mercury into babies , the consequences MD be latent . In other words , they MD not manifest or diagnosed to age 3 or 4 . So the current protocols , which require testing for NNS of sometimes as little as 48 hours , are not VBG to disclose the kind of dangers that the NN and the regulators ought to VB about . The hepatitis B NNS that are currently approved had fewer than five days of safety testing . That means that if the child has a seizure on the sixth day , it ’s never seen . If the child dies , it ’s never seen . If the child gets food allergies or ADD or ADHD , which do n’t manifest for four or five NNS or are n’t diagnosed or NN , which RB is n’t diagnosed until age 4 , the regulators will never VB that prior to licensing the NN . If something happened four or five NNS out from an event , how do you VB which event to attribute it to ? Well , the answer to that question , of course , is double - blind placebo testing . You have a NN group and you have a NN group . Sir , that ’s done all the NN . That is done all the NN . NNS are tested that NN all the NN . You ’re wrong about that . It is not required for NNS . So most of the NNS — and I VBP this is surprising to you , and it ’s shocking to most NNS , because journalists VBP yourself assume that NNS are encountering the same kind of rigorous safety testing as other drugs , including multiyear double - blind placebo testing . But the fact is that NNS do n’t . And the reason for that is they ’re classified as biologics . I ’ve read a lot of NN studies . And they are double - blind placebo tested . No , you ’re wrong about that . … But in any NN , none of them have more than a few months of double - blind placebo testing , which will not allow you to spot illnesses IN NN that are n’t diagnosed before five NNS . Second of all , in most NNS , for example the Gardasil NN , they do n’t VB true placebos . MD we move actually back to the questions that I wanted to ask ? [ Inaudible ] aluminum adjuvant that ’s highly neurotoxic . So how can you VB whether , if you do n’t VB a true placebo , how can you determine whether the NN is safe . So I had some questions I wanted to ask you , and in a Q& A that ’s the NN it works . I ask some questions , you answer the questions or do n’t answer if you VBP . I was wondering , in the NN since you spoke to the NN in January and he asked you to chair the NN safety commission , the senior HHS positions have been filled . All of them are on the record as supporting NNS . I was wondering if that ’s disappointing to you . Well , I VBP regulators that are willing to look at the NN . And who are conversant with the safety NN , who are conversant with the vast scientific literature that is now published , available on PubMed , which indicates that JJ — particularly mercury and aluminum in NNS — need to be reassessed . And as I VBD , I ’ve been having meetings with the regulators to urge them to do that kind of testing . I did VB to ask you as well if you had any qualms doing this work for NNP NNP . His administration is taking some steps at the EPA that NNS who are concerned about the environment find very unsettling . Given that , I was wondering if you had any qualms about working with him , because you ’re so renowned as an environmentalist . I do n’t VB NNP NNP ’s JJ policies , and I MD not endorse them . I MD VB that NNP NNP ’s administration is essentially destroying 30 NNS of my work on JJ issues , and the work of JJ other NNS . And I ’ve written extensively about that . And I VBP NNS understand that my position is clear and that my work on NN safety and JJ NN and child safety is not an endorsement of NNP NNP ’s JJ policies . Have you made your position VBN to him ? Have you had the chance to express those views to him ? Well , in my initial meeting with him , we had that discussion . And he knows my position . And he ’s VBN my position for JJ NNS . … I do n’t VB there ’s any question with him or with any member of the administration that I ’m opposed to [ EPA Administrator ] Scott Pruitt and I ’m opposed to walking away from [ the ] Paris [ Agreement ] . … If NNP NNP asked me to serve on a commission on fracking or on pipelines or on JJ NN , I MD do it . Can I just ask — and I VBP this will be my last question — you ’ve mentioned mercury a lot of times . Thimerosal [ a mercury - VBN preservative ] is not in most NNS given to NNS at this point . And in fact has not been in childhood NNS in the NNP NNPS since 2001 , I VBP . You VBP , studies have RB shown that since it ’s been taken out , NN rates have increased , which MD suggest that there is n’t a correlation , and that ’s what most NNS VBP . But why do you keep talking about mercury when NNS are n’t getting exposed to it in childhood NNS ? That is an industry talking point . That just simply is n’t true . Mercury was taken out of three pediatric NNS , DTaP , Hib , and hepatitis B in 2003 . But the same NN it was , CDC recommended NN shots for pregnant NNS and for NNS 6 months of age and during every NN of NN . And for most of the past 15 NNS , virtually all of those NN shots [ inaudible ] . … Since 2004 , so that MD be , I guess , 13 NNS , most NN shots were loaded with mega doses of mercury . Thimerosal is only in [ NN NN packaged in ] multidose vials . It ’s not in NN that ’s packaged in a syringe already and it was never in FluMist , the live attenuated NN . Well , here are the numbers . And the numbers VBP every NN . I VBP in 2012 , there were 185 CD doses of NN doses manufactured in this NN . And I VBP fewer than 10 CD were thimerosal - free . Over 90 percent had huge , huge doses of mercury . Not trace amounts as the industry likes to claim . Trace amounts means less than 1 microgram . They contain 25 micrograms , which is 25 times trace amount and over 100 times what EPA ’s safe exposure levels are . … So today , in the last three or four NNS , that number has been reduced to 48 CD . Which number has been reduced to 48 CD ? I VBP this NN there were 150 , RB 150 CD NN doses manufactured and 48 CD of those , or a third , were loaded with mercury . And when you VBP this NN are you talking about CD - 17 ? Or are you talking about the coming … CD . That ’s a national NN NN RB there . Mercury is 100 times more toxic , neurotoxic , than lead . Why MD you inject that into a little baby or pregnant NNS ? It ’s insane . There ’s been an Institute of Medicine report … No , no . No , IOM ’s 2004 report did not exonerate mercury . The only thing that IOM did is it looked at a series of epidemiological studies that had been recently created by CDC and VBN upon , and they only dealt with CD issue , which was NN . So all of the other injuries that are VBN to be caused by thimerosal , including ADD , ADHD , SIDS , speech delays , language delay … none of these have ever been studied ."

NN is a spectrum disorder , meaning the NNS can be classified in terms of their position on a scale . NNP Speaks points out there is not just CD type of NN but JJ subtypes influenced by a combination of genetic and JJ factors . Each individual has a distinct set of strengths and challenges affecting how they learn , VBP and problem - solve . In some NNS , NNS with NN spectrum disorder ( ASD ) require significant support , while others can live independently and hold high - functioning positions . Several factors are thought to influence the NN of the condition . It ’s widely VBN that autistic NNS often suffer from gastrointestinal ( GI ) problems , with those experiencing the worst GI problems often having the most severe NNS of NN . Recent research again highlights the intriguing link between the gut and the brain , and how dysfunction in the gut - brain axis influences ASD traits . In most NNS , NNS of ASD appear by age 2 or 3 , although NNS of associated developmental delays MD appear RB earlier . In the late 1970s , NNS discovered pairs of identical twins often shared ASD , demonstrating the condition has a genetic component . However , genetics are by far not the only , or RB primary , NN factor . Research from Stanford NNP School of Medicine , published in 2011 , which again looked at twins , discovered fraternal ( dizygotic ) twins were more likely to share an NN diagnosis than identical ( monozygotic ) twins . Fraternal twins share only half their DNA , while identical twins share 99.99 % , which means something other than genetics is responsible for the higher rate of double diagnoses among fraternal twins . According to the NNS , JJ factors are the most likely culprit . In conclusion , they stated that “ Susceptibility to ASD has moderate genetic heritability and a substantial shared twin JJ component . ” This is not an entirely surprising finding . There is no such thing as a genetic epidemic ; hence genetics simply cannot be VBN as an explanation for the exponential growth in NN NNS . Indeed , research published in 2008 VBD de novo mutations ( JJ mutations that spontaneously arise ) associated with NN were present in just 1 % of NNS diagnosed with NN . Instead , the majority of NN NNS appear to result from the activation or expression of a number of different genes , and there are several epigenetic and JJ factors that can trigger them . Among them : • Toxic exposures , such as the heavy metals aluminum and mercury from contaminated sea food and NNS , toxic microbes such as viruses and mold , glyphosate and electromagnetic fields from cellphones and Wi-Fi , just to name a few . • Brain inflammation triggered by encephalitis following NN , defective placenta , immature NN - brain barrier , immune response to the mother to infection while pregnant , premature birth and toxins in the environment . • Gut inflammation triggered by an imbalanced microbiome . Contributing factors include C-section , abnormal microbiome in the mother , bottle - feeding with infant formula and a processed food diet . Russian neurologist Dr. Natasha Campbell - McBride believes brain toxicity stemming from gut toxicity , otherwise VBN as Gut and Psychology Syndrome ( GAPS ) , is a key factor that sets the stage for NN , especially when NNS are added into the mix . According to Campbell - McBride , toxicity flowing from the child ’s gut clogs the brain with toxicity , preventing it from performing its normal function and process sensory information . As mentioned , recent research confirms and further strengthens the NN that the gut plays an important role in the NN of ASD . According to this NN , published in the journal NNP Research : In other words , genetic mutations VBN in both the gut and the brain MD be a primary culprit . Mutation in the neuroligin‐3 R451C has previously been shown to alter synaptic function in the hippocampus and cortex , resulting in impaired JJ behavior . Other research has shown neuroligin - 3 mutations can RB trigger “ specialized cognitive abilities ” seen in some autistic NNS . Previous research has RB linked the mutation to gut dysfunction . Lead investigator Elisa Hill - Yardin , associate professor at RMIT NNP in Melbourne , NNP , told Neuroscience NNP : The featured NN builds on earlier research , including unpublished JJ work by Swedish , Danish and French NNS . Neuroscience NNP reports : RB without a genetic component , the gut microbiome appears to play an important role in ASD . In a 2013 PLOS CD NN , NNS analyzed the microbial content of fecal samples from 20 healthy and 20 autistic NNS , finding distinct differences between the CD groups . As reported by NNP NNP Today : The NNS noted the autistic NNS ’s gut microflora had reduced richness and diversity , which are essential factors in creating a bacterial community capable of dealing with JJ assaults . In other words , having an imbalanced gut microbiome MD render these NNS more susceptible to the adverse effects of JJ toxins . CD of the lead authors told NNP NNP , “ We VBP that a diverse gut is a healthy gut , ” and suggested that antibiotics , which MD eliminate beneficial bacteria and have been VBN to be administered more often in the JJ three NNS of NN among autistic NNS compared to nonautistic NNS , MD play a key role . The GAPS protocol MD be the answer for JJ Campbell - McBride ’s research shows there ’s a profound dynamic interaction between your gut , brain and immune NN . She has developed what might be CD of the most profoundly important NN strategies for preventing NN . In her research , Campbell - McBride discovered that nearly all of the mothers of autistic NNS have abnormal gut flora , which is significant because newborns inherit their gut flora from their mothers at the NN of birth . Establishing normal gut flora in the JJ 20 days or so of NN plays a crucial role in the maturation of your baby ’s immune NN . Babies who develop abnormal gut flora are left with compromised immune systems , putting them at higher NN for suffering NN reactions . If your baby has suboptimal gut flora , NNS can become the proverbial “ last straw ” — the trigger that “ primes ” his / her immune NN to develop chronic NN problems . The good NN is you can rather inexpensively identify GAPS within the JJ weeks of your baby ’s NN , which can VB you VB better - informed decisions about vaccinations , and about how to proceed to set your child on the path to NN . The entire process for identifying NNS who MD be at NN for developing NN from a NN is described in her book “ Gut and Psychology Syndrome , ” but to sum it up , in her practice she starts out by collecting a complete NN history of the NNS , and their gut NN is assessed . Then , within the JJ few days of NN , the stool of the child is analyzed to determine the NN of the baby ’s gut flora , followed by a urine test to check for metabolites . Together , this can give you a picture of the NN of your child ’s immune NN . These tests are available in most laboratories IN the NN . If the test results are normal , the NN of NN after NN is significantly reduced . If you find that your baby has abnormal microflora , or begins to develop NNS of NN , the GAPS program should be started immediately , as the younger the child is when you start the NN , the better the results . The child RB should not be given any NNS until their gut microbiome tests normal . Identifying abnormal gut flora early on is crucial to protecting your child ’s NN Campbell - McBride reversed her own son ’s NN using dietary changes and detoxification , and her hypothesis is in my view CD of the most relevant . I VBP her GAPS nutritional protocol is important for most NNS these days , as a majority have poor gut NN due to poor diet and toxic exposures , but it ’s particularly crucial for pregnant NNS and JJ NNS . The best NN to prevent GAPS in the JJ place is for the mother to avoid all processed foods , sugar , antibiotics and birth NN pills before conception as these VBP yeast and fungi to grow and RB VB leaky gut . This can then be followed by breastfeeding and avoiding the NN of antibiotics during ( intrapartum ) and after delivery . Another important factor is vitamin D deficiency — especially in conjunction with damaged gut microbiome . Optimizing your vitamin D levels and your gut flora before and during pregnancy MD be CD of the most important prevention strategies discovered to date .

She came down with a fever that lasted four days and , according to her NNS , resulted in a drastic NN . “ She did not respond to her name any longer , ” VBZ her mother , Theresa Cedillo . “ She did n’t look at us . She did n’t talk . ” Michelle was later diagnosed with a severe NN of NN — the neurological disorder that affects CD in 150 JJ NNS — and , 11 NNS later , her NNS are still trying to figure out what went wrong . On June 11 a claim filed by the Cedillo family against the Department of NNP & NNP Services , which maintains a fund to compensate NNS injured by NNS , went to NN in Washington , D.C. The family claims that thimerosal , a mercury - VBN preservative once common in childhood vaccinations ( it was phased out starting in 1999 as a precautionary measure but is still VBN in some NN NNS ) , in addition to their daughter ’s MMR shot , somehow triggered her NN . Their NN before the nation ’s so - called NN NN is the JJ of 4,800 claims linking NN and childhood shots to be heard by the three judges . The results are being closely watched by thousands of families desperate to understand what NNS have so far been unable to explain : What causes their NNS ’s NN ? The debate has already turned bitter , including at the leading advocacy group , NNP Speaks , where cofounders Bob and Suzanne Wright have clashed with their daughter Katie , who insists vaccinations caused her own son ’s NN . “ There ’s a lot of kids in this NN who have literally been poisoned by the recommended NN program in the NNP NNPS , ” VBZ Wendy Fournier of the National NNP Association . Nearly all academic and NN NNS , though , VBP there is no link . A 2004 NN by the Institute of Medicine ’s Immunization Safety Review Committee reached the same conclusion . “ We MD find no evidence of a biological mechanism by which either thimerosal or MMR MD VB NN , ” VBZ Dr. Marie McCormick of Harvard ’s School of NNP NNP , who led the NN . While the search for a NN continues ( VB box ) , the arguments rage on . The Cedillos ’ attorney Kevin Conway , whose firm is handling about 1,200 NN NNS , VBZ the mercury in thimerosal from numerous shots , for such NNS as hepatitis B and diphtheria , suppressed Michelle ’s immune NN at a vulnerable stage of NN . Then , according to the family ’s claim , Michelle received a NN NN in late 1995 , which because of the child ’s weakened immune NN was able to travel through her bloodstream to the brain , where it caused inflammation and brought on NN . The family RB blames the NNS NN for Michelle ’s severe gastrointestinal problems . Because of the thimerosal , VBZ Conway , “ she was unable to clear the NN NN in that NN [ from her NN ] . ” Attorneys representing the NN are likely to attack the Cedillos ’ NN on several fronts . Chemicals , including the small amounts of thimerosal once VBN in NNS , are typically flushed from the NN within a week , VBZ Peter Hotez , chair of microbiology , immunology and tropical medicine at George Washington NNP . Dr. Samuel Katz , who helped develop the NNS shot , VBZ , “ We have no evidence the NNS NN persists in the intestines of anyone , RB immune - deficient individuals . ” ( Neither Hotez nor Katz is involved in the Cedillo NN . ) A verdict in the NN is n’t expected for up to a NN . The Cedillos are optimistic . If they win , they stand to VB compensation from the federal fund set up for NNS hurt by vaccinations . Claimants in non-autism NNS have won up to $ 10 CD — an amount that MD certainly VB . Theresa , 45 , a homemaker in Yuma , Ariz. , and her husband , Michael , 51 , a utility worker , spent about $ 18,000 last NN caring for Michelle , now 12 , who ca n’t walk without assistance or talk but loves watching Teletubbies and listening to music . “ I did n’t file this claim with the intent of saying , ‘ VB , I told you so , ' ” Theresa VBZ . “ I ’m hopeful that something good will come out of it . ”"

There were a number of memorable moments , though , and each candidate had his or her moment , for sure . But CD candidate emerged from that crowded field , and he just happens to be the most unlikely of all of them : Donald NNP . The Donald had CD of his best moments during a GOP presidential debate hosted by CNN . As NaturalNews editor and founder Mike Adams , the NNP Ranger , reported at the NN , the cable channel ’s debate moderators attempted to ridicule and destroy NNP with a “ gotcha ” question about his stance on NNS and NN . As Natural NN readers are aware , a top CDC scientist has publicly confessed to taking part in the CDC ’s fraudulent cover - up of NNS linking NNS to NN in African - Americans . But of course the mainstream NN – including CNN – and the CDC have gone to great lengths to censor that confession , bury the NN and continue pretending that NNS have no links to NN whatsoever . But of all the presidential contenders , NNP is the only NN who has publicly expressed intelligent skepticism over the ridiculous and potentially harmful NN schedule pushed on JJ NNS by a federal regulatory machine that is run by NNP Pharma profit motives . During the Q&A , it was clear that CNN was attempting to discredit NNP over the issue . NNP was asked a question that was tainted with all of the usual pro-vaccine propaganda which claims , falsely , that NNS carry no NN whatsoever and that as such they MD not possibly be linked to higher incidents of autisms .

The question to the eventual GOP frontrunner essentially accused him of being too medically incompetent to VB any claims whatsoever about NN care , and that he lacked the scientific chops as well . But when CNN posed the question , NNP ’s answer was a thing of beauty and quite brilliant . Saying that he is in favor of NNS in principle , he RB explained , “ But I VBP smaller doses over a longer period of NN . ” IN a number of informed pediatricians and NNS , NNP is very skeptical of the JJ promises made by the Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention , as well as the NN industry that it promotes . He RB went on to tell a story about NNS and NN : NN has become an epidemic … Because you take a baby in , and I ’ve seen it , and I ’ve seen it , and I had my NNS taken care of , over a JJ period of NN , over a CD or three NN period of NN , same exact amount , but you take this little beautiful baby , and you pump – I mean , it looks just IN it ’s meant for a horse , not for a child , and we ’ve had so JJ instances , NNS that work for me , just the other day , CD - NNS - JJ , CD - and - a - half - NNS - JJ , a child , a beautiful child went to have the NN , and came back , and a week later got a tremendous fever , got very , very sick , now is autistic . … I ’m in favor of NNS [ but ] do them over a longer period of NN , same amount , but just in little sections . I VBP you ’re VBG to have – I VBP you ’re VBG to VB a JJ impact on NN . Following NNP ’s answer CNN turned to CD of CD actual physicians in the crowded Republican field – genius neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson – in an obvious attempt at convincing him to attack NNP for his stance . But while professing his overall faith in NNS , Carson did VB this : “ We are probably giving NN too JJ in too short a period of NN … ” Suddenly there were CD GOP presidential contenders on the same track – that we give too JJ NNS too soon and in too JJ amounts . Finally , perhaps in desperation , the CNN moderators turned to the other physician on the Republican panel , Sen. Rand Paul , R - Ky. , but he too , confirmed what the Trumpster and Carson VBD : I ’m all for NNS , but I ’m RB for freedom . I ’m concerned about how they ’re bunched up … I ought to have the NN to spread out the NNS a little bit … Follow all the presidential NN this NN cycle and beyond at Whitehouse . NN ."

Rather than spend more NNS in what felt IN a futile search for a malaria NN , she MD take on all mosquito - borne pathogens at once . Building on the work of colleagues and other NNS , Manning , a JJ researcher for the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious NNPS , believed she MD VB pieces of mosquito saliva NN to build a universal NN . The NN , if it pans out , MD protect against all of the pathogens the insects inject into NNS - malaria , dengue , chikungunya , Zika , yellow fever , West Nile , Mayaro viruses and anything else that MD emerge . “ We need more innovative tools , ” VBD Manning . A NN IN this MD be “ the Holy Grail . ” On Thursday , The Lancet published the initial results of this work with her colleagues : the JJ - ever JJ NN of a mosquito spit NN in NNS . The NN showed that an Anopheles mosquito - VBN NN was safe and that it triggered antibody and cellular responses . Michael McCracken , a researcher not involved in the NN , called the initial results “ foundational . ” “ This is JJ , important work , ” VBD McCracken , who studies immune responses to mosquito - borne viruses at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland . “ Mosquitoes are arguably the deadliest NN on NNP . ” Malaria alone kills more than 400,000 NNS each NN , according to the NNP NNP Organization . Those deaths occur mostly in poor NNS that do not receive as much NN research and funding . Because of JJ NN , however , those mosquitoes that thrive in the tropics are moving into more NNS each NN . The JJ disruption of the NN - CD NN has brought a sharp focus to infectious NNS and NN research . CD of the key areas of concern are pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes . The novel NN , believed to have originated in bats , has so far infected more than 7.4 CD NNS and killed nearly 420,000 worldwide . The Asian NNP Bank estimates the NN MD cost the JJ NN as much as $ 8.8 trillion . Manning ’s research is specific to mosquitoes , but is an example of how NNS are broadening their thinking about how to tackle infectious NNS , and the JJ types of tools they are developing . What Manning is looking for is called a vector - VBN NN . A vector is the living organism - IN a mosquito - that transmits a pathogen such as malaria - between NNS , or from NNS to NNS . All existing NNS for NNS target a pathogen . Manning ’s goes after the vector . The idea is to train the NN ’s immune NN to recognize the saliva proteins and mount a response that MD weaken or prevent an infection . NNS have VBN for decades that mosquito spit helps establish mosquito - borne infections and enhance their severity . Just recently , NNS have begun to exploit this . A NN of macaque monkeys published in CD showed NN with sand fly saliva reduced leishmaniasis lesion size and parasite load . A NN of mice published in 2018 showed immunization with Anopheles mosquito spit protected against malaria . Another mouse NN published last NN showed immunization with Aedes mosquito saliva improved survival against the Zika NN . The NN published in The Lancet was conducted in CD . The Phase I NN conducted at the National Institutes of NNP NNP Center in Bethesda , Maryland , tested for safety and side effects in 49 healthy volunteers . Participants were randomly assigned to receive CD of CD versions of the NN or a placebo . After a few weeks , hungry mosquitoes were placed on the arms of NN participants . The NN measured immune response to the mosquito spit proteins but did not involve pathogens . More NNS are needed to determine the effect the mosquito spit NN MD have against actual pathogens . No systemic safety concerns were identified . CD participant developed an 8 - centimeter ( 3.15 inches ) reddened area IN the injection NN and was treated with steroids and antihistamines . “ I ’m not as worried about redness as I MD be about something more systemic IN fever , headache , muscle aches , nausea or vomiting , ” VBD Stephen Thomas , an infectious NNS expert at SUNY Upstate NNP NNP who was not involved with the NN . Thomas has previously worked on dengue NN programs for the U.S. Department of Defense and helped manage its response to Ebola and the Zika NN . Another scientist at the NNP of Maryland is running a follow - up NN with more mosquito spit proteins and a different NN formulation . Meanwhile , Manning has returned to Cambodia and is running a field NN to identify NN - candidate spit proteins in Aedes mosquitoes . She RB has a separate project sequencing the genomes of all pathogens VBN in Aedes and Culex mosquitoes , some of which can infect NNS . CD worrying discovery so far ? “ They carry a ton of different viruses that we are only just discovering . ”"

This NN was detected in the tissues of a dead blue jay from Lake County , Ohio . That finding establishes that WNV has arrived in Ohio . Since the NN is present in Ohio , and the most at NN populations are crows , blue jays , horses and NNS , we need to work at preventing this NN from affecting these NNS . According to the Ohio WNV Work Group , most of the efforts at preventing WNV infection are directed towards mosquito NN . This can be accomplished by eliminating standing NN : NN MD collect in JJ tires , tin cans , plastic containers , ceramic pots , or similar containers . Clean roof gutters so they drain properly in the spring and fall , clean and chlorinate swimming pools , outdoor saunas and hot tubs , and if not in NN , keep empty and covered . Drain NN from pool covers . VB the NN in bird baths at least once a week , turn over plastic wading pools , and wheelbarrows , etc. when not in NN . Non-toxic NNS such as mosquito dunks can be VBN to prevent maturation of the mosquito larvae in standing NN that cannot be readily eliminated . The USDA has recently approved a conditional license for a WNV NN for equids , including horses . Dr. Dave Glauer , NNP Veterinarian , has approved the NN of the NN in Ohio . The NN will be available starting in September of 2001 . The NN is made with a killed NN and has limited efficacy NNS , however , a similar NN for Japanese Encephalitis NN , which is closely related to WNV , has been VBN for JJ NNS . The efficacy of the Japanese Encephalitis NN has been reported at ? 80 % . NNS of WNV in horses occurred as late as October in 2000 in the eastern US . Therefore , internists at The Ohio NNP NNP , College of Veterinary Medicine recommend that if the NN is available , horses should be vaccinated twice this fall . The NN requires an initial dose and a second dose 3 to 6 weeks later . Horse owners who are interested in vaccinating their horses for WNV should contact their local veterinarian . Veterinarians are being encouraged to place orders so the NN will have some indication of the demand for the NN . As part of the safety NN of the NN , 649 horses and ponies were vaccinated . Systemic or local reactions occurred in very few of the vaccinated horses : 3 horses had localized NN reactions ( swelling and soreness ) , 2 horses were reported to have a fever following the initial NN only , and 2 horses had other reactions ( mild diarrhea within 8 hours of injection in 1 horse and 1 horse was treated for colic within a few hours of the initial NN ) . According to the report filed by Fort Dodge NNP NNP , the NN did not induce any severe local or systemic adverse reactions in 98.5 % of the vaccinations , therefore , the NN appears to be safe . Horse owners planning to export their NNS should be aware that vaccinated NNS MD not meet the import requirements of receiving NNS due to the presence of anti-WNV antibodies in NN . While these antibodies are present transiently , presence of the antibody when the horse is due to be exported MD result in denial of permission to import . In horses that do become clinically ill , the NN infects the central nervous NN and causes signs of encephalitis . JJ signs of encephalitis in horses include loss of appetite and depression , in addition to any combination of the following : fever , weakness or paralysis of hind limbs , impaired vision , ataxia ( incoordination ) , head pressing , aimless wandering , convulsions , inability to swallow , circling , hyperexcitability , or coma . Differential diagnoses for neurologic NN in the horse include rabies , botulism , equine protozoal myeloencephalitis ( EPM ) , cervical vertebral myelopathy ( CVM ) , equine herpes ( EHV1 ) , equine degenerative myelopathy ( EDM ) and other encephalitides such as western equine encephalitis ( WEE ) , eastern equine encephalitis ( EEE - reportable in Ohio ) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis ( VEE - reportable in Ohio ) , should all be considered . JJ of the reported NNS have similar JJ signs to commonly diagnosed neurologic NNS , particularly EPM . VB Ohio NNP NNP Web NN for aids in differential diagnosis . Horse owners are encouraged not to become complacent once their horses have been vaccinated . Elimination of mosquito breeding sites and personal protection are still important . Another important role the horse owner MD play in our efforts to prevent WNV is to continue to report dead bird sightings to their local NN department . The local NN department will determine if those dead birds should be transported to the Ohio Department of Agriculture for pathologic examination ."

"" There is a disconnect between the NN in which the NN perceives the NN of NN and NN 's position on a variety of issues , "" VBD Alan Leshner , CEO of the NNP Association for the Advancement of Sciences ( AAAS ) , in a press conference on Wednesday ( Jan. 28 ) . In addition , the general NN is more optimistic about the future of NN than those working in the trenches of scientific research , the survey finds . But there is some common ground : NNS and the lay NN agree that U.S. schoolchildren receive poorer - quality education in NN technology , engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) than do kids in other NNS , the NN showed . [ 6 Myths About Girls and NNP ] Surveys have consistently VBN that only about half of the NN believes NNS evolved from earlier NNS . Other studies have VBN that belief in JJ - caused NN NN divides sharply along political lines . But there has been less research comparing the views of NNS and the general NN on a wide range of other topics . To VB how NNS ' views differ from those of the general NN , the Pew Research Center , in conjunction with AAAS , called a random sample of 2,002 adults IN the NN and asked questions about whether NNS have evolved over NN ; whether genetically modified foods are safe ; and whether the NNS , mumps and rubella NN MD VB NN . The NNS RB contacted a sample of 3,748 U.S. - VBN NNS who are AAAS members to ask the same questions . They respondents were RB asked questions that touched on policy decisions and how society viewed NN and its future . On most of these issues , there was a JJ gap between the opinions of the general NN and those of NNS . For instance , 88 percent of the NNS VBD genetically modified foods are safe to eat , compared to just 37 percent of other adults . About 89 percent of NNS VBD they favored using NNS in research , compared to just 42 percent of lay NNS . And though 68 percent of NNS VBD it was safe to eat foods grown with pesticides , only 28 percent of the NN VBD the same . When it came to NN relevant to controversial policy decisions , there were JJ gaps , too . About 87 percent of the NNS VBD NN NN is mostly due to JJ activities , while just half of the NN did . More than 50 percent of the NN VBD they VBP increased offshore drilling , compared to less than a third of the NNS . And about 65 percent of NNS VBD they support building more nuclear NN plants , compared to just 45 percent of the NN . There were a few areas of agreement , however : Roughly CD - thirds of both NNS and the NN VBD the International NNP Station was a good investment , and JJ majorities of both groups VBD they favor developing bioengineered fuel . [ Best Supporting Role : 8 Celebs Who Promote NN ] Overall , however , the NN views NN positively , the survey showed . "" The majority VBP the effect of NN on the quality of food , NN care and the environment has been positive , "" VBD NN co-author Cary Funk , associate director of research at the Pew Research Center . NNS were RB more likely to VB it 's a bad NN for NN , while the NN was more optimistic about the NN of the field . And both groups VBD that basic STEM education in the NN lagged behind that of other nations . The reason for the gaps MD differ for different issues , Leshner VBD . On some issues , such as genetically modified foods , it MD be that the NN simply does n't understand what the term RB means , which suggests NNS need to do a better job of translating their NN for the NN , Leshner VBD in a NN briefing Wednesday ( Jan. 28 ) . But there are likely deeper causes behind the divide on other issues . "" In the NN of an issue IN evolution , the conflict is with NNS 's core values and their core religious beliefs , and unfortunately we have VBN for decades that ideology and core beliefs VBP NN frequently , "" VBD Leshner , who wrote an editorial about the survey results that was published today ( Jan. 29 ) in the journal NNP . But not everyone agrees that an opinion gap is always a huge problem . It 's unlikely to have huge impacts on society if JJ NNS do not VB NNS evolved from primates or that the NN began in a NNP Bang , VBD John Evans , a sociologist at the NNP of California San Diego , who was not involved in the JJ survey . But with issues IN NN NN , the gap between the NN and NN can VB more problems , Evans VBD . If NNS are VBG the NNP but the NN does n't VB in NN NN , then "" it gives politicians a reason not to do anything about it , "" Evans told Live NNP ."

For example , the NNP NNPS requires infants to receive 26 NNS — the most in the NN — yet more than six U.S. infants die IN every 1000 live births . In contrast , Sweden and Japan administer 12 NNS to infants , the least amount , and report less than three deaths IN 1000 live births . The authors of the NN , Neil Z. Miller and Dr. Gary Goldman , conducted a literature review to determine the immunization schedules for the NNP NNPS and all 33 nations with better infant mortality rates than the NNP NNPS . The total number of NN doses specified for infants aged less than CD NN was then determined for each NN . The 34 nations were then organized into NN pairs consisting of total number of NN doses specified for their infants and infant mortality rates . A scatter plot of the NN pairs provided evidence of a positive correlation : infant mortality rates and NN doses tend to increase together . Nations were RB grouped into five different NN dose ranges . The mean infant mortality rates of all nations within each group were then calculated . Analysis showed “ a high statistically significant correlation between increasing number of NN doses and increasing infant mortality rates . ” It is instructive to note that JJ developing nations require their infants to receive multiple NN doses and have national NN coverage rates ( a percentage of the target population that has been vaccinated ) of 90 % or better , yet their infant mortality rates are poor . Infant mortality rates will remain high in nations that cannot provide clean NN , proper nutrition , improved sanitation , and better access to NN care . Nations with higher ( worse ) infant mortality rates give their infants , on average , more NN doses . This positive correlation , derived from the NNS , elicits an important inquiry : Are some infant deaths associated with over - NN ? Is it possible that some nations are requiring too JJ NNS for their infants and the additional NNS are a toxic burden on their NN ? Stock up with Fresh Food that lasts with eFoodsDirect ( AD ) There is some evidence that a subset of infants MD be more susceptible to SIDS shortly after being vaccinated . For example , Torch VBD that unvaccinated babies who died of SIDS did so most often in the fall or winter while vaccinated babies died most often at 2 and 4 months — the same ages when initial doses of DPT were given to infants . He concluded that DPT “ MD be a generally unrecognized major NN of sudden infant and early childhood death , and that the risks of immunization MD outweigh its potential benefits . ” It appears as though some infant deaths attributed to SIDS MD be NN related , perhaps associated with biochemical or synergistic toxicity due to over - NN . All nations have an obligation to determine whether their immunization schedules are achieving their desired goals .

You VBP , it ’s politically expedient RB now , with NNP NNP in office , for the Leftist Mob to highlight every single mainstream NN NN item about illegals that makes the Commander - in - Chief look IN a monster . RB it was NNS “ in cages ; ” then it was NNS dying ; then it was NNS trying to escape tear NN ; and so on and so forth . For visual manipulation purposes , these libtards have discovered that spreading images of NNS crying next to border patrol pickup trucks or lying on the floor behind fencing makes those “ resisting ” NNP appear noble and virtuous – because only a tyrant MD allow such things ( RB though JJ of the images being circulated were actually taken while Obama was in office ) . Nevertheless , the dumbest segments of the left - leaning population seem to fall for this JJ NN every single NN – and yet they ’re nowhere to be VBN in defending JJ NNS from much worse threats , IN compulsory NN . As we reported back in CD , for instance , California Senator Richard Pan , a Democrat , single - handedly eliminated exemption provisions in the Golden NNP allowing NNS to opt their NNS out of compulsory NN for personal and philosophical reasons , and the Leftist Mob was quick to storm the streets in protest , JJ ? Wrong . RB though NNS harm and injure tens of thousands of JJ NNS every single NN , almost nobody on the Left has ever VBN a thing about this mass genocide masquerading as “ medicine . ” Similarly , the Left is completely silent when it comes to the JJ JJ NNS who have been raped and killed by the precious illegal aliens whom they MD seem to VB their number - CD priority . Why is this , you ’re probably asking ? Because the Left has devolved into little more than a herd of mindless , brainwashed sheep . Those who listen to what the likes of MSNBC and CNN have to VB about NN events have been programmed to VB that enforcing immigration laws is “ evil , ” but injecting NNS with deadly chemicals that impair them for NN , or in JJ NNS kill them , is perfectly fine . NNP NNP is the JJ NN in recent history to actually VB protecting JJ lives a top priority It ’s a NN of cognitive dissonance and JJ - out willful ignorance on the part of these virtue - signaling phonies , who seem entirely unable to discern good from evil . Keep in mind that NNP NNP , whom JJ of these Leftists VBP to be “ literally Hitler , ” is actually the JJ NN in recent history to actually VB Americans a priority rather than illegal aliens and other special interest groups . This was made evident back in December when NNP NNP ’s Department of NNP and NNP Services ( HHS ) announced plans to implement a “ Conscience and Religious Freedom Division ” that MD eliminate mandatory NN nationwide – and this was all done under the directive of NNP NNP himself . NNP NNP is similarly standing his ground in ensuring that an effective border wall is constructed between the NNP NNPS and Mexico to prevent illicit drugs , JJ trafficking , and other heinous evils from continuing to move back and forth across the border – again an indication that he cares for Americans and wants to protect them from the plight of globalism . But the Left is unable to VB any of this , unfortunately , and MD rather pretend as though the NN is sitting there in the Oval Office laughing with his pinky in the NN IN Dr. Evil as illegal immigrant NNS are being sniped by Border Patrol . It ’s NNP Derangement Syndrome to the max , and it does n’t appear to be letting up anytime soon ."

The_DT future_NN of_IN civilization_NN might_MD very_RB well_RB depend_VB on_IN it_PRP ._.","The 2010s are over , and the double - 20s are about to begin . CD phrase that I 'd VB to never hear again is "" post - NN era , "" an idea that has gained prominence during the past decade , especially the last few NNS . CD dominant theme of post - truthery is that every NN has a NN to his / her own interpretation of the facts , and that these alternative interpretations–or "" alternative facts , ” as NNP adviser Kellyanne Conway famously called them –deserve to be taken seriously . They do n't . And yet , IN most of the pseudoscience that I 've been writing about for NNS now , we have to continue calling out nonsense for what it is , because some of it is harmful , and RB deadly . Politics is a never - ending font of post - truthery ( or truthiness , as Stephen Colbert defined it in 2005 ) , but here I 'm concerned about NN . Today I 'll highlight three anti-truth campaigns that have caused great harm over the past decades , in the hope that they will soon fade away . Among serious NNS , NN is not being questioned . Indeed , the essence of NN is the search for objective NN . Sometimes , though , a scientific discovery threatens to undermine the NN or profits of an influential industry , and that 's when industry resorts to denialism ( which is essentially the same thing as post - truthiness ) . Perhaps the most well - documented example of organized NN denialism dates back to the 1950s , when accumulating evidence made it clear that smoking causes cancer . The tobacco industry did n't VB to admit this , RB though their own internal research supported it , because it meant that their main product was killing their customers , which in turn was terrible NN for their business . In response , Eventually , after decades of lawsuits and literally millions of smoking - related deaths , the industry was forced to admit the NN and pay out billions of dollars in settlements in the U.S. Nonetheless , JJ NNS still smoke , and RB as recently as CD , the largest tobacco NN in the U.S. , Philip Morris , was still trying to deny the NN about cigarettes . My second example is more recent , and potentially RB more harmful to the JJ NNS . You might have already guessed it : I 'm talking about NN NN denialism . For several decades , the evidence has been building that the NN is getting warmer . A series of reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) warned , in increasingly confident terms , that NNS were the primary NN of recent NN , mostly due to our NN of fossil fuels and the NN they emit into the atmosphere . The current IPCC report VBZ unequivocally that NNS have already caused 1° C of NN , and that the NN will increase rapidly over the next several decades . Scientifically , these facts are not in dispute . The NN is already experiencing more severe storms , unprecedented floods and droughts , and die - offs due to NN oceans ( such as the massive and tragic die - off of coral in Great Barrier Reef ) . However , the fossil fuel industry sees JJ NN as a threat to their profits . Rather than invest in JJ , cleaner forms of NN , JJ NNS such as Exxon - Mobil and billionaire coal magnates such as the Koch brothers have poured countless millions of dollars into disinformation campaigns to cast doubt on the NN of NN NN . Prominent among these efforts is The Heartland Institute , a fossil - fuel - funded organization whose main mission is to cast doubt on the NN of NN NN . ( Heartland has RB worked to cast doubt on the link between smoking and cancer . ) NN NN denialists learned from the tobacco NNS that it was possible to delay NN action by decades , simply by casting doubt on the NN . Unfortunately , their campaigns have been working . For NNS , JJ U.S. politicians denied that the NN was getting warmer . As that argument has become increasingly harder to VB with a straight face , they 've changed their strategy , and now they might admit that the NN is heating up , but deny that JJ activities are responsible . They 're still wrong . The goal of this denialism is , simply put , to protect the profits of fossil fuel industries . However , NN does n't care if you VBP it or not . The NN is getting hotter . NNP just had its four hottest days in recorded history . The unprecedented heat wave has led to hundreds of fires through much of the NN , threatening every major city on the continent . There 's no reason to VB this wo n't keep happening . NN NN denialists are only fooling themselves –after being duped by NN and coal NNS . My third and final example is CD that has frustrated me for 15 NNS now , and it ’s CD that just wo n't VB away : the anti-vaccination movement . This is CD of the most frustrating examples of post - NN wrongheadedness , in part it seems so unnecessary , and because so JJ NNS have been harmed as a result . RB , let 's be clear about the facts : NNS are CD of the greatest boons to JJ NN in the history of NN and medicine . NNS VBD to die by the millions from smallpox , polio , and a dozen other infections that are now almost completely preventable by NNS . Smallpox was 100 % eliminated from the NN in 1980 , in CD of humankind 's greatest JJ NN triumphs . Polio has now been eradicated from nearly all NNS , and a NN that started in 1988 has now reduced polio to just a few NNS and fewer than 100 NNS worldwide . Both of these successes are due to NNS . JJ other NNS , including NNS , chicken pox , and bacterial meningitis , have been reduced so dramatically by NNS that physicians in the U.S. and Europe almost never VBP a NN . This graph shows the dramatic effect of the NN NN , which was introduced in the U.S. in the early 1960s : The graph shows the number of reported NNS , but actual NNS were much higher , likely RB 4 CD NNS IN NN by CD estimate . These are the facts . So what happened ? The modern anti-vax movement , led by a small number of extremely vocal , extremely self - confident individuals , began in 1998 with the publication of a fraudulent NN ( later retracted when the fraud was uncovered ) claiming that NNS caused NN . The NN was led by JJ physician Andrew Wakefield , who later lost his JJ license because of his fraud , which included misleading his co-authors and mistreating patients . Nonetheless , this NN was picked up and amplified by several celebrities with JJ followings , including JJ Playboy NN and MTV host Jenny McCarthy and political activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr , the nephew of JJ US NNP John Kennedy . RFK Jr . Anti-vax activism is all over the web today , despite JJ efforts to quash it . Countless claims of "" my child got sick after his NN jab "" are presented as proof that NNS VBP harm , and under post - truthism , we 're supposed to take such claims seriously . These stories can be especially difficult to respond to , because JJ NNS are dealing with NNS who have genuine NN problems –including autism–and the NNS often truly VBP what they are saying . Thus it wo n't do to tell them to be quiet and VB away : their NNS RB do need JJ care . They 're simply wrong in believing that NNS have anything to do with their childrens ' problems . Their beliefs are amplified by NNP groups and websites whose sole purpose is to echo and amplify the mistaken claims of anti-vaxxers . RB though there was never any good evidence that NNS VBP NN , NNS have conducted dozens of studies involving literally millions of NNS to answer precisely that question , and the evidence is very , very clear : NNS do not VB NN , nor do they VB any other systematic neurological or behavioral problems . NNS do prevent NNS , though , and unvaccinated NNS can and will VB sick . Recent experience has RB given us , tragically , JJ examples of NNS who died from entirely preventable infections , because their NNS did n't vaccinate them . These tragedies did n't have to happen . Every era is the age of NN . The idea that we 're in a "" post - NN era , "" despite being repeated thousands of times in articles , essays , and op - eds over the past decade , is a commentary on NNS 's ability to fool themselves , not on the NN of the NN . NN describes the NN as it is , and those who choose to deny it might win a short - term argument , but in the JJ term , they will always lose . Finally , on a more positive note , I 'm somewhat heartened by efforts to educate college students on how to recognize and counter bogus ideas , such as the NNP of Washington course , Calling Bullshit , created by Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West . ( Yes , that RB is its title . ) As the professors wrote : If you 're interested , they 've made the lectures available as free videos on NNP . Labelling an era as post - anything has always , to me , suggested a lack of substance , as if the era is defined only by what came before it . The NN of "" post - "" RB ignores that fact that the next era will need a name too . Should we expect "" post - post - NN "" to come next ? And what MD that look IN ? Let 's hope that the 2020s will give us a return to simple respect for NN . The future of civilization might very well depend on it ."

Reflect On : Why did they lie for NNS about this ? Why did they conduct a massive NN NN shaming those that questioned NNS ? Why did they invent the term ‘ anti- vaxxer ’ to put NNS who question NNS in a negative light ? This is truly a bombshell story when you understand the full implications of it , yet major NN likely will not touch it . Headlines MD read “ In stunning lawsuit , CDC admits they have no evidence NNS do n’t VB NN ” – but instead , crickets . Independent NN organizations IN CE are left to have to tell these stories , and at the same NN VB more demonetization for telling the NN that the NN should VB . Of course , we RB VBP that since independent NN ’s reach has been cut , getting stories IN this out is very hard and relies on you , the dear reader , to spread the word . As of March 2nd , 2020 , the CDC has admitted in federal NN that they do not have any evidence proving that NNS given to babies do n’t VB NN . For NNS they claimed that the studies had been done , the evidence was clear , and that there was a consensus : “ NNS do n’t VB NN . ” Yet , this was a lie . An organization called the Informed Consent Action Network ( ICAN ) was instrumental in bringing forth this admission . As they stated in their own press release : In summer 2019 , ICAN submitted a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request to the CDC requesting “ All studies relied upon by CDC to claim that the DTaP NN does not VB NN . ” ICAN RB submitted this same request for HepB , Hib , PCV13 and IPV , as well as requesting the CDC provide studies to support the cumulative exposure to these NNS during the JJ six months of NN do not VB NN . Despite months of demands , the CDC failed to produce a single specific NN in response to these FOIA requests . ICAN was therefore forced to sue the CDC in federal NN , where the CDC finally conceded , in a stipulation signed by a Federal NN judge , that that it has no studies to support that any of these NNS do not VB NN . In short , the CDC provided a list of studies that were to claim NNS did not VB NN , only , none of these studies proved that . Part of the list was a recent review by the Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) , which was paid for by the CDC . This NN performed a comprehensive review of studies relating to the DTaP NN . It was looking to determine whether or not the NN does or does not VB NN . The IOM was unable to identify a single NN to support that DTaP does not VB NN . What they did find was a single NN that did show an association between DTaP and NN . So for NNS , the CDC falsely claimed that “ NNS do n’t VB NN . ” This was VBN on no evidence , no studies , no NN , just speculation . In turn , those that questioned NNS were called anti-vaxxers , unscientific and extreme about their views , yet were they wrong to claim that NNS MD VB NN and that they do n’t feel they are safe ? It does n’t seem to be the NN when you consider that a look at the NN and evidence available suggests it ’s highly likely that vaccinees do play a role in NN . This , as we VBP now , has not been debunked nor fully proven . The detail that hits close to home for us here at CE is that fact - checkers have been handing out JJ claims about our NN content , stating that “ NNS do n’t VB NN . ” This has led to a reduction in our reach and the near - complete destruction of our business due to demonetization . Yet , where did these fact - checkers VB their information from ? The CDC . And now we VBP , the CDC never had the evidence to VB the claims they made , and the fact - checkers were in fact wrong or truly misinformed . These JJ claims from the CDC have RB effectively led to creating a culture of blind NN acceptance RB though there is no evidence they are safe . This leads to the challenge not JJ are realizing about fact - checking organizations IN Snopes , or the ones that work on NNP ; what they do , is turn to major organizations and the NN to VB their ‘ facts . ’ And those facts overrule anything brought forth that challenges those ‘ facts . ’ So essentially fact - checkers are merely purveyors of facts produced by governments and major corporations . Some RB happen to be paid by major corporations . There is an abundance of NN showing that NNS MD be linked to NN , in JJ different ways . Take aluminum for example , A NN published in 2018 discovered high amounts of aluminum in the brain tissue of NNS with NN : The fact that aluminum in adjuvant form does not exit the NN as aluminum in our own food , for example , is CD of multiple ways that NNS have shown how NNS MD be implicated in the aetiology of NN . You can read more about NNS and aluminum specifically , here . This is not the JJ NN in history that major NN organizations , NNS and doctors claimed that something was safe when it was n’t . Look at cigarettes , agent orange , and DDT . These were just a few that became common knowledge after JJ NNS brought awareness forward about the dangers associated with these NNS . All the while , the NNS who owned them , and their cronies fought to claim these NNS were unscientific , liars and wrong . Are we seeing this now with NNS ? It sure seems to be following the same pattern . CD thing I always look at is if major organizations cannot answer the simple question , and instead turn to ridicule , name - calling and NN campaigns to cast doubt , then you VBP they are hiding something . In my feeling , the CDC knows full well the dangers of NNS , and they are buying NN to figure out how to keep themselves clean for when the cards fall . Because they will .

JJ OMPFs contain both personnel and JJ active duty NN records , but the service branches discontinued retiring the NN record portion to the NPRC in the 1990s . In the past , all of the JJ services retired the individual NN record , along with the personnel record , to the NPRC upon a service member 's separation from service . The Army and the NNP Force retired its NN records with the Official NNP Personnel File , while the Department of the Navy ( including the Navy , Marine Corps and Coast Guard ) retired these files separately to the NPRC until the 1980s . NN records cover the outpatient , dental and mental NN NN that JJ members received while in JJ service . NN records include induction and separation physical examinations , as well as routine JJ care ( NN / dental visits , lab tests , etc. ) when the patient was not admitted to a hospital . In comparison , JJ ( hospital inpatient ) records were generated when active duty members were actually hospitalized while in the service . Typically , these records are NOT filed with the NN records but are generally retired to the NPRC by the facility which created them ( VB JJ records for more information ) . JJ records from the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) are RB not included . In the 1990s , the JJ services discontinued the practice of filing NN records with the personnel record portion at the NPRC . In 1992 , the Army began retiring most of its JJ members ' NN records to the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) . Over the next six NNS , the other services followed suit . In 2014 , the JJ services dicontinued the practice of retiring the records to the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) . In order to determine where a JJ record is located , please VB the chart below : Veterans who plan to file a claim for JJ benefits with the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) do not need to request a copy of their JJ NN record from the NPRC . After a claim is filed , the VA will obtain the original NN record from the NPRC . In addition , JJ NN records were lent to the Department of Veterans Affairs prior to the 1973 Fire . Veterans who filed a JJ claim should contact the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) in order to determine if their record is already on file .

A Stanford NNP JJ research group led by Robert Sapolsky has been working on it . Of course , this NN is heralded in the mainstream NN ( MSM ) as yet another modern JJ miracle . This latest NN nightmare focuses on a few physiological biochemical events within the endocrine NN as an attempt to prevent chronic stress from harming the immune NN . But injecting NNS containing foreign particles , heavy metals , and viruses into our bodies has been proven to harm immunity short and JJ - term . RB if NN contents were safe , the antigens that indicate a NN ’s assumed success do n’t provide real immunization . This proposed stress cure bypasses what NNS should do to relieve stress naturally or by directly addressing their emotional and mental NN . But vaccinating the population against stress MD serve as a terrific adjunct to fluorides for maintaining a docile , chronically sick society . Robert Sapolsky spent some NN in the African wild circa 1980 amongst a baboon population , whose hierarchal behavior was viciously unpredictable , making NN uncertain for the ones dependent on alpha baboons . Sapolsky observed that JJ of the baboons , dependent on the alpha rascals , appeared thin and unhealthy . Sapolsky VBD tranquilizer darts on them to be able to draw NN , and he measured their fight or flight hormone NN levels . Sure enough , they were high . More importantly , NN analyses showed a direct link with other markers of a damaged immune NN and bad NN . At the NN of Sapolsky ’s baboon research , mainstream medicine did n’t consider stress an important factor for bad NN . He helped bring more awareness to stress , especially chronic stress , as a factor for all NN . That was a good thing . But his NN solution , mired in the AMA - NNP Pharma paradigm , is only a good thing for his and NNP Pharma ’s bottom line . Sapolsky and his research NN focused on a NN to circumvent glucosteroid hormones that create stress . They bio-engineered a herpes NN , ostensibly eliminating its dangers while supposedly preserving the NN ’ inherent neuro - protective genes . This is aimed toward artificially meddling with the endocrine NN . This bio-engineered NN combined with all that ’s necessary to preserve and boost a NN creates a dangerously unpredictable cocktail for injecting directly into the bloodstream . From IN 1985 to now , there has been an explosion of chronic stress in our modern NN . The unpredictability of managing to lead a safe and secure NN has risen dramatically . More NNS are realizing they have to simplify their lives . Arguing and fighting less domestically or on the job is CD solution for reducing stress . Robert Sapolsky observed how baboons that walked , not ran , away from fights seemed to be healthier . Practicing hatha yoga with special attention to the “ corpse pose ” that wraps up a session works wonders . Peaceful , self discipline applied with meditation offers a JJ - term solution to coping with the chronic , stressful conditions surrounding us . Meditation practiced daily has been clinically proven to reduce RB cardiac NN probabilities connected to stress . Practicing taichi and chi-gong to reduce stress and improve NN has caught on more over the last few decades . Short term solutions are available with herbal and homeopathic remedies that VBP relieve stress and depression . Acupuncture can be applied to reduce stress . Aldous Huxley once argued by mail with George Orwell over their visions of futuristic NN NN tyranny . Huxley posited a pharmaceutically conditioned population , easily controlled with minimal force , while Orwell saw mind NN and force as the controlling factors . Unfortunately , they were both JJ . http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/07/ff_stress_cure/all/1_ADD About the author : Paul Fassa is dedicated to warning others about the current corruption of food and medicine and guiding others toward a direction for better NN with no restrictions on NN freedom .

"" CDC is working with manufacturers to maximize influenza NN availability , and with NN care providers to develop contingency plans so that NNS can be vaccinated in a safe environment , "" Redfield VBD , adding that ongoing NN - CD activity MD affect when , where and how NN NNS are given .

These MD all seem unrelated , but according to macroeconomic researcher Rob Kirby , they are all connected . Kirby explains , “ With China and their upstart CIPS , which is the China Interbank Payment NNP , China appears to be on the verge of merging their interbank payment NN with SWIFT . My gut is telling me that this will very much marginalize NNP as the main processor of JJ payments . This , in my view , will embody very possibly a JJ reset in terms which currency is VBG to be the NN ’s reserve currency . I have a very sneaking suspicion that when China merges with the SWIFT NN , I VBP there is a very strong possibility that China will back their currency with gold . I do VB this is why China has aggressively been buying physical gold for the past 10 or 15 NNS . They have been doing it with a view to dislodging the dollar or greatly diminishing the dollar as the NN ’s reserve currency . That ’s what I VBP is at play RB now . I VBP U.S. bankers and regulators have caught wind of this and are aware it is coming . I RB VBP this is the reason for all the secret meetings they have been having . The Federal Reserve Board met in secret behind closed doors ( Monday morning ) , and they gave us some frivolous reason why they were meeting . The Fed Chairman , that Monday afternoon , walked over to the White NNP and met with , not just the NNP , but RB the Vice NNP . The notion that the NNP and Vice NNP MD be in the same room at the same NN tells you this is national security related . If you do n’t VB the preservation of the dollar as the NN ’s reserve currency is n’t a national security issue , you better VB again . ” MD there be a dramatic and overnight reduction in the value of the dollar ? Kirby contends , “ I VBP this is coming in very short order now . The trail of bread crumbs is indicating this is what is afoot RB now . ” Does that mean dollar devaluation and a bank “ holiday ” coming soon ? Kirby VBZ , “ How quickly this happens is open for conjecture , but that is clearly the direction we are heading . We are unmistakably headed in that direction . The only real question is how RB these criminal central bankers can MacGyver the NN together and keep it together with elastic bands , paperclips and bungie cords . This is VBG down . This is VBG to happen . I VBP it ’s VBG down in the next CD or three weeks . . . . We ’ve all speculated that this MD eventually happen . Now we are here , and the clock is about to strike midnight . ” What have the NNP and the VP been told by the Fed Chairman in these emergency meetings this week ? Kirby VBZ , “ My guess is they are probably explaining to them just how deep the pooh is that they are about to be thrown into . It ’s deep , and it ’s VBG to be over their heads . . . . Historically , when banks have nothing else they can do , they take us to NN . ” If they do n’t take us to NN ? Kirby VBZ , “ Everything is on the table . . . . My thinking is there are an awful lot of U.S. dollars out there RB now that are VBG to be coming home to NNP . . . . The adjustment in JJ reserve accounts MD create a tsunami of dollars coming back to NNP in a very , very short period of NN . That MD trigger something approaching a hyperinflationary event or , at least , stagflation and super inflationary pressure . That ’s the minimum occurring very , very soon . ” About the recent revelation of Deutsche Bank suppressing the price of physical gold and silver ? Kirby points out , “ The price rigging ultimately comes back to and will be shown that it RB is an operation of the U.S. Treasury and the U.S. Federal Reserve . . . . The short interests , or the paper NNS of precious metals , have been VBN on purpose to suppress the growing demand for precious metals , or to VB it appear that NNS are still happy with dollars and do n’t prefer precious metals to dollars . . . . Whether the U.S. central bank declares that gold or silver are not NN in some hubris filled silliness does n’t diminish the fact that gold and silver are NN , and your U.S. Constitution VBZ gold and silver are NN . ” Join Greg Hunter as he goes CD - on - CD in a pivotal interview with Rob Kirby of KirbyAnalytics.com . Kirby RB adds , the globalists hate and fear a NNP Presidency because he will unwind the anti-American secret trade deals IN the TPP .

Sixty - CD unarmed Palestinian demonstrators were shot dead and nearly three thousand more were injured by gunfire and tear NN versus no Israelis killed or wounded while a leading Knesset parliamentarian has assured the NN that the Army has plenty of bullets left to kill all the Gazans if necessary . The White NNP , however , has obviously not seen the NN footage of the slaughter , and was instead celebrating the opening of the JJ NNP Embassy in Jerusalem intended to coincide with the 70th Anniversary of the creation of Israel , which some might RB refer to as the 70th anniversary of the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian Christians and Muslims . Donald NNP tweeted that it was a “ great day for Israel , ” apparently having missed watching the slaying of the Palestinians by split screen as the largely JJ Jewish celebrants yukked it up with a broadly grinning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . A short NN later someone named Raj Shah at the White NNP told reporters at a press briefing that “ The responsibility for these tragic deaths rests squarely with Hamas . Hamas is intentionally and cynically provoking this response ” as “ a gruesome and unfortunate propaganda attempt . ” And meanwhile over at the NNP Nations , JJ Ambassador Nikki Haley vetoed a Russian proposal seeking an investigation into the carnage , explaining that that Hamas , aided of course by Iran , was to blame for the violence . “ I ask my colleagues here in the Security Council : who among us MD accept this type of activity on your border ?

To be sure , some Democratic Congressman have expressed horror over what has been taking place . Barbara Lee , Betty McCollum and Bernie Sanders have all spoken up . Sanders VBD that “ Israel should be condemned . ” Congressman Mark Pocan declared that “ There are better ways to deal with the tensions in Gaza than bullets . ” Pocan and Raúl Grijalva , Pramila Jayapal , Keith Ellison , and Hank Johnson all expressed shock and dismay at “ the lethal force VBN by Israeli troops against mostly unarmed protesters demonstrating at Gaza ’s border . ” They asked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s NN to “ show utmost restraint , allow for unfettered JJ attention for those who have been wounded , and ease the 12 - NN blockade on Gaza , which has contributed to grave food insecurity , unemployment and a humanitarian NN for Gaza ’s CD CD inhabitants . ” Congressmen Johnson and Pocan as well as Dan Kildee of Michigan have recently called for the Israeli NN to permit them to enter the Palestinian region to VB what is happening on the ground there . The three congressmen visited Israel in CD but were blocked from crossing into the Gaza Strip by the Israeli Coordination and Liaison Administration , which operates the borders and entry points , limiting who can enter and leave as well as the flow of such essentials as food supplies . It might astonish some Americans to learn that Israel can stop any U.S. Congressmen from entering Gaza , which Tel Aviv illogically claims is no longer under its NN RB though it has turned the area into an outdoor prison camp . CD notes particularly the lack of RB a single Republican concerned over the completely disproportionate carnage in Gaza . Senator Rand Paul , who CD referred to Israeli controlled Gaza as a “ concentration camp , ” is notable by his absence . Senators Ten Cruise , Lindsey Graham , Dean Heller and Mike Lee ( a bit of a surprise that , but he is a Mormon ) were all part of the official delegation , which RB included a number of GOP NNP members as well as Florida governor Rick Scott . Regarding the Democrats , it has RB been observed that the party base does not any longer support the philo - Israel policies embraced by the Clintonesque Democratic National Committee leadership . Those congressmen who have spoken out certainly deserve the NN ’s support when they find Israel ’s behavior just too much to take . It MD have been refreshing to VB more Congressmen criticizing Israel for what are indisputably NN crimes in using live fire against unarmed demonstrators . And they should VB the same blunt language they VBP when criticizing NNP or NNP Korea or Iran . Unfortunately , RB when there have been comments or statements that express some concern , they are inevitably and invariably wrapped in excuses for Israel ’s inhumane actions , referring to provocative protests “ organized by Hamas , ” a claim that is pure Israeli propaganda , and / or blaming “ all sides , ” which again distributes the fault to VB Israel look IN a victim as well as the Gazans . It is typical newspeak intended to avoid making Israel and its friends unhappy . The NN is that what Israel does in its own neighborhood endangers the NNP NNPS and makes every NNP who travels through the Middle East a target . I recently returned from a conference in Iran and , as the Gaza tragedy was unfolding , we JJ participants were all wondering if we MD VB it home . We considered that Israel , bent on a NN with Iran that MD drag the U.S. in to do the real fighting , might just choose their moment of apparent strength with the JJ Embassy and the “ successful ” slaughter of the Palestinians without so much as a peep out of the White NNP , as a good NN to escalate . How JJ civilian airliners might VB shot down ? How JJ more Palestinians will have to die for the monstrous Benjamin Netanyahu ’s NN lust truly to be satisfied ?"

It 's now uncommon in the UK because of the effectiveness of NN . Anyone can VB NNS if they have not been vaccinated or have not had it before , although it 's most common in JJ NNS . The infection RB clears in RB 7 to 10 days . The initial NNS of NNS develop RB 10 days after you 're infected . • cold - JJ NNS , such as a runny nose , sneezing and a cough • sore , red eyes that MD be sensitive to light • a high temperature ( fever ) , which MD reach RB 40 C • small greyish - white spots on the inside of the cheeks A few days later , a red - brown blotchy rash will appear . This RB starts on the head or upper neck before spreading outwards to the rest of the NN . At the moment it can be hard to VB what to do if your child is unwell . It 's important to trust your instincts and VB JJ NN if you need it . When to VB a GP You should contact a GP as soon as possible if you suspect that you or your child MD have NNS . It 's best to phone before your visit as your GP surgery MD need to VB arrangements to reduce the NN of spreading the infection to others . You should RB VB a GP if you have been in close contact with someone who has NNS and have not : • been fully vaccinated with 2 doses of the MMR NN • had the infection before You should do this RB if you do not have any NNS . NNS can be unpleasant , but will RB pass in about 7 to 10 days without causing any further problems . Once you have had NNS , your NN builds up resistance ( immunity ) to the NN and it's highly unlikely you 'll VB it again . But it can lead to serious and potentially NN - threatening complications in some NNS . These include infections of the lungs ( pneumonia ) and brain ( encephalitis ) . The NNS NN is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected NN coughs or sneezes . You can easily catch NNS by : • touching a NN the droplets have settled on and then placing your hands near your nose or mouth ( the NN can survive on surfaces for a few hours ) NNS with NNS are infectious from when the NNS develop until about 4 days after the rash RB appears . How NN can be prevented NN can be prevented by having the NNS , mumps and rubella ( MMR ) NN . This is given in 2 doses as part of the NHS childhood NN programme . The JJ dose is given when your child is RB 13 months JJ , and a second dose is given at 3 NNS and 4 months . Adults and older NNS can be vaccinated at any age if they have not been fully vaccinated before . Ask a GP about having the NN . If the MMR NN is not suitable for you , a NN called JJ normal immunoglobulin ( HNIG ) can be VBN if you 're at immediate NN of catching NNS . How you can ease the NNS of NNS There are several things you can do to VB relieve your NNS and reduce the NN of spreading the infection . • taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve fever , aches and pains ( aspirin should not be given to NNS under 16 NNS JJ ) • closing the curtains to VB reduce light sensitivity • using damp cotton wool to clean the eyes • staying off school or work for at least 4 days from when the rash RB appears In severe NNS , especially if there are complications , you or your child MD need to be admitted to hospital for NN ."

A live NN uses a weakened version of a NN to teach the immune NN how to respond to the real thing . RB after the NN is gone , the NN remembers its immuno - playbook and stands prepared to fight a stronger pathogen in the future . NNP Korea ’s national immune NN was instructed and strengthened by previous crises .

NNP Korea ’s NN - class response to NNP - CD is not the product of religion , or cultural destiny , but rather the result of NNS bested and crises weathered .

On 23 April the JJ JJ JJ NNS began at a lab in Oxford ; RB 800 NNS were recruited to take part . Now , on 16 June , Imperial College is starting a JJ NN in 300 volunteers . A further 10,000 volunteers are RB wanted across England , Wales and Scotland . Jack Sommers was CD of the JJ to have the jab on the Oxford NN three weeks RB . [ This piece was originally published on 6 June ] . It ’s been a month since I RB signed up for the NN NN NNS . I was paid a grand total of £ 235 for five hospital visits , various needles to be stuck in my arm , and generally to be VBN as a JJ guinea pig , all in the hope I MD VB to develop the much - discussed NN - CD NN . Nothing has been talked up as our potential saviour more than the Oxford NNP NN NN , CD of scores being developed IN the NN . The NN has been repeatedly cited as the best hope of returning us to our pre-Covid lives and the UK NN is seriously invested ; it pledged a combined £ 43 CD to UK - VBN laboratories rolling out JJ testing . The JJ phase , which I was part of , took place in England last month . Now they ’re expanding it to ask tens of thousands of Brits across the NN to take part and put themselves in the same position as me in the coming weeks . If you do sign up , prepare for the process to be more mundane than you might expect . A NN NN combines a lot of admin , IN signing up for a bank account but with the light trepidation of having your holiday jabs . You apply via an JJ questionnaire and will be asked every conceivable question about your NN history and your family . Once approved , you ’ll be called to the hospital . The JJ NN I went to St George ’s in NNP London I had been self - isolating in my NN for CD months ; I live alone and am recently unemployed . I VBD myself in a waiting room surrounded by other NNS I presumed were there for the same reason ( the only other test subjects I VBP of are three macaque monkeys ) . Despite our common bond the awkward GP - surgery atmosphere meant we did n’t talk . On this JJ visit you are required to give urine and NN samples , fill out forms and watch a NN about how they ’re expecting you ’ll only VB mild side effects . Then you VBP home to await the JJ light once everything checks out . In the meantime be prepared for your friends and family to have endless questions , including JJ wrongly assuming you will be exposed to NN as part of the NN – you wo n’t . I have VBN myself inundated with well wishes ( and a few NN theorists RB too ) . CD days after my JJ hospital visit I sent a frantic follow - up email asking why I had n’t yet had the call to return for the injection . The reply basically VBD : ‘ Calm down and wait ’ . It was at this point I started feeling nervous for the JJ NN . I was called and returned to the hospital – although I was anxious it was RB the closest I had come to a normal workplace in weeks . It was a tantalising reminder of NN pre-lockdown ( despite the sterile atmosphere ) . My nostalgia quickly evaporated as a nurse started talking about the NNS given to the rhesus macaques ; I salute the monkey 's sacrifices for JJ NN but the serene ‘ guinea pig ’ image in my head was now well and truly gone . I thought back to a few messages I had had from NNS shielding , including CD woman with multiple sclerosis who told me : “ You are doing something that MD VB millions of NNS ” . This made me , a grown NN who does n’t VB needles and puts a hand in front of his face during horror films , feel fearless . The injection itself – the only dose you receive – was painless . I was given a thermometer and asked to record my NNS daily through an JJ diary . My biggest side effect seems to have been paranoia . I do n’t VB whether I was in the 50 NN cent given the actual NN or 50 NN cent given a NN , but twice in the JJ week I went to bed with mild fever NNS , which I MD , in retrospect , have imagined . “ Raised temperature and sneezing , ” I wrote in the diary ’s text box on day three with the solemn resignation you might VB to telegraph that the Titanic had struck an iceberg . Given my temperature that day was a perfectly normal 36.5 degrees , my narrative did n’t always quite VB reality . As the weeks have gone on I ’ve not suffered any further NNS . Instead my preoccupation has become with the success of the NNS . I VBD not to care whether Imperial or Oxford got there RB but every piece of good NN about “ my ” NN has made me VB to cheer and blow an Oxford NNP vuvuzela out the window . Then when it was reported that the vaccinated monkeys all ended up contracting NN , I was bereft . Thankfully I will not ( intentionally ) be made to face the NN in the same NN but I VBP to tell my grandchildren I tested the NN that saved humanity , not CD of the forgotten scores that did n’t work . Looking back , I can VB I ’d incorrectly seen myself as the protagonist who had to have the best story , the most dramatic side effects . Eventually , I came to appreciate there will be JJ NNS and thousands more volunteers on the Oxford NN alone . Next week I ’ll be back in hospital for follow - up tests just as the latest volunteers arrive for their JJ shots . Failure and learning are central to the NNS eventually succeeding so RB if my NN does n’t work , I wo n’t ever regret having been CD of the JJ to add my name to the list . To sign up to participate in a NN NN , you can register your interest RB ."

And as RB as the NN NN is circulating — which it is — it ’s not too late to VB your shot .

You ’re not totally off base with your question — if you got yours several months RB , it ’s reasonable to VB its effectiveness has worn off . Assuming you ’re older than 8 NNS JJ , it turns out you do n’t need a second NN shot this NN NN . A second dose is recommended only for kids ages 6 months through 8 NNS who have never been vaccinated before or only had CD shot in the past , explains Elizabeth Barnett , MD , professor of pediatrics at Boston NNP School of Medicine . “ Because of the immaturity of [ their ] immune NN , they do not respond well to a single dose of NN NN , ” she VBZ . “ Though a single dose will not result in a good immune response , it primes the immune NN to respond to a second dose , which then results in a good immune response . ” Adults and older NNS , on the other hand , are already primed , thanks to their previous vaccinations . “ Currently , there are no recommendations for any other age group to receive more than CD NN NN in a NN , ” VBZ Dr. Barnett , who is RB a spokesperson for the NNP Academy of Pediatrics . Adults who have never had a NN shot until this NN RB wo n’t benefit from a second NN in the same NN . Kids who do meet the criteria for a second NN shot should VB their JJ dose as soon as it ’s available . The second dose should be administered at least four weeks later , according to the CDC . There is some preliminary evidence that the effectiveness of the NN NN MD wane over the course of a NN NN , Dr. Barnett adds , but “ at this NN , this information does not represent a rigorous NN of the phenomenon , ” she VBZ , and the research certainly is n’t strong enough to warrant getting another shot . Bottom line : Rest assured that you did the best thing you MD by already getting CD shot — and just keep washing those hands !"

""_'' See_VB also_RB my_PRP$ ""_`` Winston_NNP Churchill_NNP Illuminati_NNP ""_''","Since writing this in 2004 , I have come to the conclusion that It was common knowledge that the Rothschilds ran both Britain and USSR and there is no NN England MD allow Germany His real mission was to lead Germany Hitler did n't VB a NN NN , and had no stomach for fighting England , according to Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist Louis Kilzer , author of Churchill 's Deception ( Simon & Schuster , 1994 ) . Hitler believed the future of Western civilization depended on the cooperation of Germany and her Aryan cousins : England and the NNP NNPS . His territorial demands were limited to Communist NNP , which he regarded as a proxy for Jewish NN ambitions . He was determined to avoid fighting a NN on CD fronts . The "" miracle at Dunkirk "" was an extraordinary peace overture to England . We do n't normally associate Hitler with such magnanimity . In NNP 1940 , the British were on the verge of defeat . The English army was trapped at Dunkirk . Rather than take them prisoner , Hitler halted his generals for three days allowing 330,000 NNS to escape . "" The NN of every single Englishman is too valuable to shed , "" Hitler VBD . "" Our CD NNS belong together racially and traditionally . That is and always has been my aim , RB if our generals can't grasp it . "" ( Kilzer , p.213 ) This is not an attempt to exonerate Hitler . His ideology of Aryan racial supremacy and his enslavement / extermination of "" inferior races "" ( mainly Jews and Slavs ) are abhorrent to me . ( Do I need to VB this ? ) My own grandparents were murdered by the Nazis . I VBP NNS can take pride in their race or nationality without seeking to dominate others . Nonetheless , we should understand that our view of Hitler is influenced by propaganda . The Allies were RB guilty of atrocities and NN crimes . Furthermore , Hitler was created , manipulated and destroyed by the same Illuminist clique that runs the NN today . According to Kilzer 's well - documented book , Hitler was trying to convince the English to VB peace . In exchange , he was ready to retreat from Western Europe and from much of Poland . Kilzer describes how British Intelligence ( an arm of the Illuminati ) took advantage of Hitler 's racist ideology to divert his energies against NNP and trap him in a CD - front NN . They convinced him that a JJ pro Nazi ( anti Communist ) "" Peace Party "" was prepared to unseat the "" warmonger "" Churchill . This party consisted of the Duke of Windsor ( the JJ King Edward VIII ) and appeasement - minded elitists VBN as the "" Cliveden Set . "" The Nazis had longstanding JJ ties with this group and confided in them . Hitler seemed to overlook the fact that Windsor went to stay at the Rothschild castle in Austria after he abdicated . Rudolph Hess , the Deputy Leader of Nazi Germany , was in contact with the Cliveden group and flew to England NNP 10 , 1941 to negotiate peace . According to Kilzer , Hess had Hitler 's blessings . Coincidentally this was the worst night of the Blitz . Afterwards , there was a JJ lull in both Nazi and British bombing raids . It appears the Nazis thought they had an understanding with the British and turned their attention to the invasion of NNP the following month ( June 22 , 1941 . ) Hitler did n't understand that the Anglo JJ elite was ( and still is ) intimately connected with international ( i.e. Rothschild ) finance . Anglo JJ imperialism is , in fact , a front for the families that own the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve . These Jewish and non-Jewish families are connected by NN , marriage and Lucifer worship ( i.e. Freemasonry ) . Both Roosevelt and Churchill were their flunkies . ( All our "" leaders "" are . ) In 1776 Meyer Rothschild financed the Illuminati , a Masonic secret society that in turn spawned the major revolutions of the modern era including the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 . The ultimate aim is to establish the banker NN dictatorship , which is at an advanced stage today . In the 1930s their purpose was to incite a CD - front NN that MD leave the great nation NNS ( England , Germany and NNP ) prostrate . IN all wars , the purpose was to kill millions of NNS , traumatize humanity , increase JJ debt and private profit , and VB "" NN NN "" ( the future UN ) seem essential for "" peace . "" The 1930's British Policy of Appeasement was probably designed to encourage Hitler 's expansionist tendencies and to provoke NN . Douglas Reed , the ( London ) Times Correspondent in Berlin , was RB tipped off to something fishy when his newspaper suppressed his warnings of the Hitler menace . ( VB his Controversy of Zion ) Why MD the JJ elite RB VB to destroy NNP , which they created ? The transcript of the 1938 NKVD interrogation of C.G. Rakowsky ( a.k.a Chaim Rakeover ) provides the answer . Rakowsky was an intimate of Trotsky 's and JJ Soviet ambassador to Paris . Rothschild 's agent Leon Trotsky was supposed to succeed Lenin but got sick at the critical moment . Stalin was able to assume NN and divert NNP from Rothschild NN . In order to VB Stalin , international finance was forced to build up Hitler and the Nazi party . Rakowsky confirms that Jewish financiers backed the Nazis although Hitler was not aware of this . "" The ambassador Warburg presented himself under a JJ name and Hitler did not RB guess his race ... he RB lied regarding whose representative he was ... Our aim was to provoke a NN and Hitler was NN ...[ the Nazis ] received ... millions of dollars sent to it from Wall Street , and millions of Marks from German financiers through Schacht ; [ providing ] the upkeep of the S.A and the S.S. and RB the financing of the elections ... "" Unfortunately for the bankers , Hitler RB proved intractable . He started to print his own NN ! "" He took over for himself the privilege of VBG NN and not only physical moneys , but RB JJ ones ; he took over the untouched machinery of falsification and put it to work for the benefit of the NN ... Are you capable of imagining what MD have come ... if it had infected a number of other NNS and brought about the creation of a period of autarchy [ absolute rule , replacing that of the bankers ] . If you can , then imagine its counterrevolutionary functions ... "" Hitler had become a bigger threat than Stalin , who had not meddled with NN . The British were not VBG to VB peace with Hitler because he had stopped the banker 's racket . Furthermore , the Illuminati wanted an extended NN , the ruin of Europe and the expansion of the USSR . The book "" NNP Origins of National Socialism "" ( 1933 ) by "" Sydney Warburg "" provides another glimpse of how the Illuminist clique supported Hitler . This 70 - page booklet was suppressed for JJ NNS but was republished in 1983 as "" Hitler 's Secret Backers . "" "" Warburg "" describes a July 1929 meeting with "" Carter , "" the NNP of J.P. Morgan 's Guarantee Trust , the Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks , "" the NNP Rockefeller "" and "" Glean from Royal Dutch . "" These are all Rothschild dominated . It was determined that Warburg who spoke German should travel to Germany and ask Hitler how much NN he needed to overthrow the NN . The only stipulation was that Hitler adopts "" an aggressive foreign policy . "" "" Warburg "" details five meetings with Hitler between 1929 and 1933 . The JJ took place in a beer cellar and Hitler calculated his needs on the back of a paper plate . About $ 25 CD was transferred . This was extremely important in the depth of the depression because the Nazis provided food and shelter to JJ of their supporters . Hitler was n't told the reason for this support and did not ask . On CD occasions , he wondered out loud if "" Warburg "" was himself Jewish but dismissed the idea before "" Warburg "" MD reply . There is no "" Sydney Warburg "" but the internal evidence suggests the author MD be James P. Warburg , son of Federal Reserve founder Paul Warburg . General Ludendorff's wife testified at the Nuremburg NNS that James P. Warburg was the conduit through which eventually $ 34 CD was transferred from Wall Street to the Nazis . PRP wonders why anyone MD VB to this much trouble to alienate the most powerful NNS in the NN if he were n't sincere . The only NNS with the NN to suppress it are the ones it incriminates , and they have a record of suppressing similar works . VB RB Antony Sutton 's Discussion of this book . "" Who controls the past controls the future : who controls the present controls the past . "" George Orwell The winners write history . Our view of Hitler and the Second NNP NNP is largely a Jewish view . Paradoxically Hitler was created and manipulated by the bankers he railed against . He lost the NN because he did n't appreciate their larger agenda . He naively failed to recognize that they controlled England and the NNP NNPS . It 's as if he did n't VB his own propaganda . Blinded by racist zeal , he made a fatal blunder ( from his point of view ) of not neutralizing England by seizing the Middle Eastern oilfields . He made another fatal error by not promising to liberate the Russian NNS from oppression . Nazi brutality turned the Slavs into implacable fighters . But for his demented racist ideology and consequent barbarism , Hitler might have done some good . JJ Germans and RB some German Jews supported him . Instead , he was another pawn in the Illuminati 's diabolical NN . --- VB RB my "" Was Hitler a ' British ' Agent ? "" VB RB my "" Winston Churchill Illuminati """

Andrew Cuomo , the governor of NNP York , is delivering the last of his daily briefings , which have been watched avidly from Bensonhurst to Buffalo , and well beyond . Back in early April , when the Empire NNP was recording more than ten thousand JJ NN NNS each day , and nearly eight hundred deaths on some days , the sight of a socially distanced Cuomo VBG calmly through the latest figures , and explaining the situation regarding masks , gowns , and ventilators , presented a ghastly spectacle , but RB a reassuring NN . With the NN effectively leaderless , there was at least CD responsible adult in a position of authority — or so we told ourselves as we hunkered down in our apartments and listened to the ambulances racing by . During the past couple of months , NNP York ’s NN figures have fallen precipitously . On Thursday , the NN reported six hundred and eighteen JJ infections , and just thirty - CD deaths . Most of NNP York is now well into the reopening process , and NNP York City will take another significant step next week , Mayor Bill de Blasio confirmed on Thursday , allowing JJ offices , retail NNS , barbershops , and playgrounds to reopen . From this point on , Cuomo will deliver his NN - CD briefings as needed , he has indicated . NNP York ’s comeback is a testimony to the heroic efforts of NN professionals , E.M.T. employees , transit workers , delivery - truck drivers , and equally essential workers in supermarkets , warehouses , and other places — JJ of them poorly paid — who kept the stricken city and NN VBG through its darkest days and nights . Cuomo and de Blasio , after some critical early missteps , RB deserve credit for sticking at it , as do ordinary NNP Yorkers who obeyed the stay - at - home orders and wore masks when they became available . The key point is that it took a monumental and community - wide effort to limit the official death toll to fewer than twenty - five thousand statewide . ( VBN on the number of “ excess deaths ” this NN , the actual figure is probably considerably higher . ) The experiences of NNP Jersey and Massachusetts were similar . Now , as NN counts rise alarmingly in other parts of the NN , there is every reason to suppose that these places will need similarly comprehensive efforts to prevent a disaster from occurring . At the moment , though , particularly in parts of red NNP , a combination of poor leadership , JJ exhaustion , and JJ - wing politics is greatly hampering an effective response . Take Arizona , Florida , and Texas , three Republican - run NNS that began reopening their economies in early NNP . In all three NNS , the number of confirmed JJ NNS has spiked over the past couple of weeks . On Thursday , Arizona reported 2,519 JJ infections and Florida reported 3,209 , both of which were record highs . On Tuesday and Wednesday , Texas reported almost eight thousand JJ NNS , which is by far its biggest CD - day count yet . These numbers are still relatively small compared to what was experienced in the Northeast , but the nature of a NN is that when it gets VBG it can spread very rapidly , and there are other worrying signs that this MD be starting to happen . In all three NNS , the percentage of tests returning positive results has increased , which means the rise is n’t simply an artifact of more testing . In Arizona , the rate of positive tests was five NN cent on NNP 10th , and it ’s now 9.1 NN cent , according to reporting on Thursday from KTAR , a Phoenix NN station . In Florida , the positive rate was below five NN cent a month RB , and it ’s now 7.4 NN cent , according to the NN database that Johns Hopkins NNP maintains . The number of hospitalizations has RB risen sharply . In Arizona on Wednesday , 3,861 NNS had been hospitalized for NN - CD , compared to 1,699 a month RB , according to figures from the NNP Tracking Project — a rise of about a hundred and thirty NN cent . A JJ director of the NN ’s NN department has warned that emergency field hospitals MD be needed by July 4th . In Texas , NN authorities reported on Thursday that there are 2,947 NNS with NN - CD in hospitals , which represents a doubling since Memorial Day . In Florida , 12,673 NNS have been hospitalized , compared with a cumulative total of 8,553 a month RB , according to the NNP Tracking Project . As yet , the number of deaths has n’t risen as sharply as hospitalizations . That MD well VB in the coming weeks . With the NN spreading , bitter disputes have arisen between the NNS ’ Republican governors — Doug Ducey , in Arizona ; Ron DeSantis , in Florida ; and Greg Abbott , in Texas — and local leaders in the hardest - hit areas , who are calling for mandatory mask - wearing , more NN resources , and an expansion of contact tracing . Despite having had months to prepare for a possible surge in infections , all three NNS have fallen woefully short in all of these areas . The dispute over the NN of masks is particularly tragic , since it is by far the easiest and cheapest NN to check rapid spread of the NN . Pressured by conservative activists and demonstrators , who in turn have been inspired by NNP NNP ’s chronic irresponsibility on this matter , Ducey , DeSantis , and Abbott have refused to issue statewide orders mandating wearing masks in NN . Finally , in the past couple of days , CD of them — Ducey , in Arizona , and Abbott , in Texas — have shifted ground , but the manner in which they moved demonstrated the damaging politics at play . On Wednesday , Abbott VBD that , while he was sticking to his refusal to act at the NN level , he MD support local authorities and businesses that require employees and customers to wear masks . “ We VBP to VB sure that individual liberty is not infringed upon by NN and , hence , NN cannot require individuals to wear a mask , ” told a Waco television station . “ However , pursuant to my plan , local governments can require NNS and businesses to require masks . ” The same day , Ducey belatedly acknowledged reality , noting , “ There is a trend , and the trend is headed in the wrong direction . ” He RB dropped his opposition to cities in Arizona , such as Tucson and Flagstaff , mandating the wearing of masks in NN , but he again refused to issue a statewide order , saying it MD n’t work , and adding , “ I VBP some NNS view this as an issue of personal freedom . ” It has RB been a basic principle of democratic governance that where JJ NN comes into conflict with individual freedoms , the latter MD have to be constricted , at least temporarily . But with NNP in the White NNP and elected Republicans terrified of incurring his supporters ’ wrath , there is now , in parts of red NNP , nobody willing to VB this argument or to follow through with actual edicts . Local leaders and their constituents are left to fend for themselves . Indeed , DeSantis , in Florida , VBD this openly on Wednesday , when , after insisting that he MD n’t suspend any of his reopening measures , he added that residents of the NN should “ VB wise decisions for themselves VBN upon their own personal NN . ”"

Childhood NNS protect NNS from a variety of serious or potentially fatal NNS , including diphtheria , NNS , mumps , rubella , polio , tetanus , whooping cough ( pertussis ) and others . If these NNS seem uncommon — or RB unheard of — it 's RB because these NNS are doing their job . Still , you might wonder about the benefits and risks of childhood NNS . Here are straight answers to common questions about childhood NNS . Is natural immunity better than NN ? A natural infection might provide better immunity than NN — but there are serious risks . For example , a natural chickenpox ( varicella ) infection MD lead to pneumonia . A natural polio infection MD VB permanent paralysis . A natural mumps infection MD lead to deafness . A natural Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) infection MD result in permanent brain damage or RB death . NN can VB prevent these NNS and their potentially serious complications . NNS do not VB NN . Despite much controversy on the topic , NNS have n't VBN a connection between NN and childhood NNS . In fact , the original NN that ignited the debate NNS RB has been retracted . Any NN can VB side effects . RB , these side effects are minor — a low - grade fever , fussiness and soreness at the injection NN . Some NNS VBP a temporary headache , fatigue or loss of appetite . Rarely , a child might experience a severe allergic reaction or a neurological side effect , such as a seizure . Although these rare side effects are a concern , the NN of a NN causing serious harm or death is extremely small . The benefits of getting a NN are much greater than the possible side effects for almost all NNS . Of course , NNS are n't given to NNS who have VBN allergies to specific NN components . Likewise , if your child develops a NN - threatening reaction to a particular NN , further doses of that NN wo n't be given . Why are NNS given so early ? The NNS that childhood NNS are meant to prevent are most likely to occur when a child is very JJ and the NN of complications is greatest . That makes early NN — sometimes beginning shortly after birth — essential . If you postpone NNS until a child is older , it might be too late . Is it OK to pick and choose NNS ? In general , skipping NNS is n't a good idea . This can leave your child vulnerable to potentially serious NNS that MD otherwise be avoided . And consider this : For some NNS — including those who can't receive certain NNS for JJ reasons ( such as cancer therapy ) — the only protection from NN - preventable NNS is the immunity of the NNS IN them . If immunization rates drop , NN - preventable NNS might once again become common threats . If you have reservations about particular NNS , discuss your concerns with your child 's NN . If your child falls behind the standard NNS schedule , ask the NN about catch - up immunizations . NNP NNP Minute : Why and when NNS should be vaccinated for NN NNP NN Minute : Why and when NNS should be vaccinated Elizabeth Cozine , M.D. : NN prevents a child from getting an illness . It RB prevents them from spreading an illness . Jason Howland : Dr. Elizabeth Cozine , a NNP NNP family physician , VBZ the Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention has a standard immunization schedule for school - age NNS that begins with ages 4 to 6 . Dr. Cozine : … which we VBP of as kindergarten shots . So that 's NN , mumps , rubella and varicella . Jason Howland : She VBZ the next set of routine immunizations is at age 11 … Dr. Cozine : … which is tetanus , diphtheria and pertussis , and the meningococcal immunization .

Dr. Cozine VBZ it 's important to educate families on the importance of childhood vaccinations . She likens it to seat belt safety . Dr. Cozine : Immunizations are no different . If we have opportunities to protect our NNS against serious illness and potentially RB death , RB if the NN of that illness or the NN of death from that illness is RB quite low , I 'm all for it ."

Farben , BASF , Hoechst , Dow and Bayer , who created the NN chambers and tested dangerous NNS on innocent Jews , did n’t just VB away . In fact , they went to work for U.S. corporations and pharmaceutical NNS that run the NN industry today . At least a dozen of these cold blooded killers were hired fresh out of prison , just 4 to 7 NNS after the Nuremberg NNS VBD them guilty of mass murder and enslavement . In fact , at the close of WWII , the IG Farben building in Frankfort was protected from allied bombings by the highest levels of JJ command . Why ? IG Farben was the FDA / CDC type of “ pharmaceutical arm ” of Hitler ’s 4th Reich , and the Rockefellers had a JJ interest in maintaining and controlling this pharmaceutical empire , which MD soon be catapulted on U.S. NN . Research reveals that Hitler RB invested heavily in Merck and other pharmaceutical NNS . Nazi convicted mass murderers became executives for major U.S. chemical and pharmaceutical NNS Fritz ter Meer , VBN guilty of slavery and mass murder at Auschwitz , served only seven NNS in prison and became Chairman of the Board at Bayer in 1956 . Still trust U.S. NNS ? This is the same NN industry today which protected and employed Nazi NN criminals . The very industry that produced the Nazi NN chambers was purchased by Bayer . So , exactly whom are you trusting with your NNS ’s NN and welfare ? Currently , the U.S. NNP and the CDC rely solely on the manufacturers of NNS to report problems , injuries and deaths . This atrocity is IN letting murderers be their own judges in NN ! Where are the checks and balances this NN was founded upon ? NNS have JJ and political agendas now , and the FDA does absolutely no testing of their own before making decisions to release NNS to the masses . VB more research before you or your child VB injected with a JJ concocted NN for which there is no cure ? Listen to stunning admissions by NN industry experts , including Dr. Maurice Hilleman ( formerly w / Merck ) , who admitted to the deadly nature of the most trusted NNS . Today ’s NNS not only contain live versions of the NNS you DO NOT VB , but RB contain GMOs , hormones from infected cows , pigs , chickens and monkeys , untested NN combinations ( IN H1N1 ) , aluminum , mercury , emulsifiers , and crossbred bacteria from NNS , mosquitoes , and diseased NNS : NN Live NN NN : ( Attenuvax ) Made by Merck . CD injections are given ; CD at 1 NN and another at 4 NNS JJ . Contains gelatin , sorbitol , sodium chloride , bovine cow serum , egg NN and JJ albumin . NNS and Mumps Live NN NN : ( M - M - Rvax ) Made by Merck . Injected into CD NN JJ babies . Contains gelatin , sorbitol , sodium chloride , bovine cow serum , and JJ albumin . Diptheria , Tetanus and Polio NNP : Five injections given between 2 and 6 NNS of age , plus boosters “ recommended ” every 10 NNS . Contains formaldehyde , phenoxyethanol and aluminum phosphate . DTaP , IPV , HBV and Hib* : ( Diphtheria , tetanus , polio , hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenza type B ) Given to infants 2 to 12 months with boosters less than a NN later . Contains aluminum hydroxide , formaldehyde , and bovine cow serum . Gardasil HPV : JJ Papillomavirus NN Made by Merck . “ Recommended ” 3 intramuscular injections ; given at birth , 2 and 6 months of age . Re-administered to NNS as JJ as 9 NNS of age for a rare sexually transmitted NN . Contains polysorbate 80 , sodium chloride , aluminum , and a “ denatured ” ( fragmented and weakened ) form of the NN . • Bovine cow serum : Extracted from cow NN . When injected causes connective tissue disorders , arthritis and lupus ; RB shortness of breath , low NN pressure , chest NN and NN reactions . • Sorbitol : Synthetic sweetener which metabolizes very slowly and aggravates IBS and gastrointestinal issues . • Gelatin : Derived from the collagen inside NNS ’ NN and bones . Injecting gelatin poses the NN of infection from synthetic growth hormones and BSE infectivity ( mad cow NN ) . • Egg NN : NNS are prepared in eggs ( certainly not organic ) . MD contain growth hormones , antibiotics , and salmonella bacteria . • Thimerosal : A neurotoxic mercury which causes NN : There are 25 mcg in CD average NN NN , and the EPA safety limit is 5 micrograms , so NNS who are vaccinated simultaneously with multiple * NNS receive over 10 times the safety limit of mercury in CD day . • JJ albumin : The NN portion of NN frompooled JJ venous plasma ; when injected causes fever , chills , hives , rash , headache , nausea , breathing difficulty , and rapid heart rate . Injecting “ pooled NN ” can result in a loss of NN NN mass and VB immunodeficiency NN infection , or contain SV40 , AIDS , cancer or Hepatitis B from NN addicts . • Formaldehyde : Highly carcinogenic fluid VBN to embalm corpses . Ranked CD of the most hazardous compounds to JJ NN ; can VB liver damage , gastrointestinal issues , reproductive deformation , respiratory distress and cancer . Plus , formaldehyde has been VBN to fail todeactivate the virusthe NN is intended to cure , thus enabling a live NN to enter your NN and infect your NN . • Phenoxyethanol : A glycol ether / chemical ; highly toxic to the nervous NN , kidneys , and liver . The FDA warns “ can VB shut down of the central nervous NN ( CNS ) , vomiting and contact dermatitis ” in cosmetics ; imagine when injected into your NN . • Aluminum phosphate : Greatly increases toxicity of mercury , so caution aboutminimum mercury toleranceis therefore severely underestimated . CDC NNS and all doctors are well aware of this . • MSG ( monosodium glutamate ) : When injected becomes a neurotoxin , causing CNS disorders and brain damage in NNS . If you especially enjoy being lied to , visit vaccinateyourbaby.org , where they tell you formaldehyde is safe because it is “ present in the environment and is a byproduct of metabolism , so it is already present in the JJ NN . ” They RB inform you that aluminum is good for you , because “ [ a ] luminum is RB commonly VBN in food , NN , infant formula and RB breast milk . ” Hey , if it ’s in the environment , it must be safe to inject into your veins ( so why not VB snake venom , bleach , and plutonium ? ) . VB the ultimate alternative to NNS that prevents NN ? Buy organic vitamins , minerals , antioxidants , amino acids , and enzymes !"

Few NNS are available regarding the effect of sirolimus on NN response . Willcocks FW al. investigated immune responses to influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations in 9 hepatic and 23 renal transplant recipients who had been randomized to either continue on a calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ; tacrolimus or ciclosporin ; n = 17 ) or switch to sirolimus ( n = 15 ) at least 3 months after transplantation . All patients received — from the same batches — an influenza NN and , 4 weeks later , a pneumococcal NN . Four weeks after influenza NN , mean titers of antibodies against all three influenza antigens tested had increased significantly in both patient groups ( P < 0.0005 ) and there were no significant differences in increases between groups . Nevertheless , all sirolimus - treated patients mounted an antibody response against at least CD influenza antigen that was deemed to be protective , compared with only 75 % of CNI - treated patients ( P = 0.038 ) . Eight weeks after pneumococcal NN , the mean antibody levels for 6 of the 7 pneumococcus serotypes measured had increased significantly in patients in both groups ( P < 0.05 ) ; no significant differences in pneumococcus antibody levels or changes in antibody levels were observed between groups . Transplant type , serum creatinine level and number of immunosuppressant agents had no effect on response to either NN .

When a NN proves effective , there ’s a good chance it will entail a CD - dose series , USA Today reported . Shots MD need to be administered CD month apart , with a booster following several NNS later . As of June 2 , the NNP NNP Organization ( WHO ) listed 10 NN candidates under JJ evaluation , with 123 candidates in preclinical evaluation . Barry Bloom , immunologist and professor of JJ NN at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of NNP NNP in Boston , told USA Today that almost all of the NN developers are considering CD shots in their regimens . According to the outlet ’s report , the JJ shot in the series MD “ prime the immune NN ” to VB the NN recognize the NN , followed by a second shot to “ strengthen the immune response . ” When NN candidates reach JJ JJ NNS , more precise dosing will become clear , Dr. Kelly Moore , associate director of immunization education for the Immunization Action Coalition , told the outlet . After the JJ dose of a NN , the immune NN develops antibodies and immune NNS in about 14 days , VBZ L.J. Tan , chief strategy officer with the Immunization Action Coalition and co-chair of the National Adult Immunization Summit and National Influenza NNP Summit . Tan estimated any NN - CD NN requiring CD doses MD likely be administered about a month or CD apart . NN HAS NOT RESURGED IN OREGON FOLLOWING REOPENINGS , NN NN OFFICIAL NNS In addition , WHO officials VBD the NN is n’t mutating to become more dangerous during a briefing on Wednesday . Since the NNP - NNP - 2 is seemingly stable so far , initial NNS MD act as boosters later on to extend immunity , Bloom told the outlet . However , NNS are n’t sure how durable NNS ’s immune response will be . For coronaviruses causing the common cold , Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious NNPS , VBD immunity almost always lasts less than a NN . "" It MD be completely different with this NN , with NNP - NNP - 2 , it MD be that they induce a response that ’s quite durable , "" Fauci told the editor of the Journal of the NNP NNP Association . A CD - dose regimen in treating NNP - CD across the NN MD demand more extensive coordination and record - keeping to ensure patients receive the full course of NN . While NNS race for an effective NN , directors of NN NN agencies are reportedly using the NN to prepare immunization registries . USA Today reported the agency directors are in frequent contact with the CDC and immunization registry managers to “ record and track the vaccinations of JJ numbers of adults . ”"

But they are urging funders and policymakers to ensure that NNS develop other NNS that do not rely on such JJ fetal NN lines and , in the NNP NNPS , asking the NN to “ incentivize ” firms to only VB NNS that do n’t rely on fetal NNS . “ It is critically important that Americans have access to a NN that is produced ethically : no NNP should be forced to choose between being vaccinated against this potentially deadly NN and violating his or her conscience , ” members of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and 20 other religious , JJ , and political organizations that oppose abortion wrote to Stephen Hahn , commissioner of the U.S. Food and NNP Administration ( FDA ) , in April . “ Thankfully , other [ NNP - CD ] NNS … utilize NN lines not connected to unethical procedures and methods . ” “ We urge your NN to fund the NN of NNS that do not create an ethical dilemma for JJ Canadians , ” wrote Archbishop of Winnipeg Richard Gagnon , NN of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops , and 17 other antiabortion religious , JJ , and politic groups and individuals in a 21 NNP letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau . “ The … manufacture of NNS using such ethically - tainted JJ NN lines demonstrates profound disrespect for the dignity of the JJ NN . ” FDA and senior White NNP officials did not respond to NNS requesting comment on the letter to Hahn . In Canada , the NN ministry has promised to respond to the letter to Trudeau , VBZ Moira McQueen , executive director of the Canadian Catholic Bioethics Institute and lead signatory on the letter . NNS derived from elective abortions have been VBN since the 1960s to manufacture NNS , including current NNS against rubella , chickenpox , hepatitis A , and shingles . They have RB been VBN to VB approved drugs against NNS including hemophilia , rheumatoid arthritis , and cystic fibrosis . Now , research groups IN the NN are working to develop more than 130 candidate NNS against NNP - CD , according to the NNP NNP Organization ; 10 had entered JJ NNS as of 2 June . At least five of the candidate NNP - CD NNS VBP CD of CD JJ fetal NN lines : HEK - 293 , a kidney NN line widely VBN in research and industry that comes from a fetus aborted in about 1972 ; and NNP . C6 , a proprietary NN line owned by Janssen , a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson , developed from retinal NNS from an 18 - week - JJ fetus aborted in 1985 . Both NN lines were developed in the lab of molecular biologist Alex van der Eb at Leiden NNP . CD of the five NNS have entered JJ NNS ( VB table , below ) . In four of the NNS , the JJ fetal NNS are VBN as miniature “ factories ” to generate vast quantities of adenoviruses , disabled so that they cannot replicate , that are VBN as vehicles to ferry genes from the novel NN that causes NN - CD . When the adenoviruses are given as a NN , recipients ’ NNS begin to produce proteins from the NN , hopefully triggering a protective immune response . The fifth NN , which has shown promise in monkeys and is headed for JJ NNS as soon as this summer , is what is VBN as a NN subunit NN . NNS at the NNP of Pittsburgh VBP HEK - 293 NNS to manufacture the NN ’ spike NN — a vital part of its structure — which is VBN to trigger an immune response . The NN is delivered through a NN patch with 400 tiny needles . The fetal NN lines are key to producing both types of NN . “ HEK - 293 [ NNS ] are essential for making NN subunit NNS , ” VBZ Andrea Gambotto , a NN scientist at the NNP of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and the NN ’s lead developer . Their JJ origin is important , he VBZ : “ Cultured [ nonhuman ] NN NNS can produce the same proteins , but they MD be decorated with different sugar molecules , which — in the NN of NNS — runs the NN of failing to evoke a robust and specific immune response . ” ( Among the developers of the five NNS , only Gambotto responded to a request for comment . ) David Prentice , vice NN and research director at the Charlotte Lozier Institute , which opposes abortion , notes NNS making adenovirus NNS have modified HEK - 293 NNS to be adept at packaging JJ genes — such as those that direct NNS to assemble the NN spike NN — into adenoviruses . But he adds that other technologies are available , including using NNS captured from amniocentesis that are engineered to VB replication - deficient adenoviruses . “ The NN of NNS from electively aborted fetuses for NN production makes these five NN - CD NN programs unethical , because they exploit the innocent JJ beings who were aborted , ” Prentice and a co-author — molecular biologist James Sherley , a Lozier Institute associate scholar and director of the adult stem NN NN Asymmetrex — wrote in a position paper published last month . But Arthur Caplan , a bioethicist at the NNP York NNP School of Medicine , counters : “ There are better ways to win the abortion wars than telling NNS not to VB a NN . These are JJ - over abortions . These NNS are decades JJ , and RB major religious leaders IN the pope have acknowledged that for the greater good it ’s not worth the symbolism to put the community at NN . ” The Vatican ’s Pontifical Academy for NNP declared in 2005 and reaffirmed in CD that in the absence of alternatives , Catholics MD , in good conscience , receive NNS made using historical JJ fetal NN lines . A NN made by the Chinese NN CanSino Biologics was the JJ NNP - CD NN to enter phase II JJ NNS . It was developed using adapted HEK - 293 NNS that the NN licensed from Canada ’s NRC , where the NNS were developed . ( NRC - developed HEK - 293 NNS have already been VBN to develop an approved Ebola NN . ) Last month , NRC announced a collaboration with CanSino Biologics under which it is preparing to run late - stage JJ NNS of the NN in Canada , and scale up facilities to produce the NN in quantity . The CD U.S. - backed NNS that have drawn criticism from antiabortion groups are on a short list of candidates targeted to VB JJ and logistical support from the U.S. NN under the White NNP ’s Operation Warp Speed , which aims to accelerate the NN and approval of at least CD NN - CD NN by January 2021 , according to a 3 June report in . CD of the Warp Speed candidates , made by Janssen Research & NNP , uses NNP . C6 NNS . The second , from NNP of Oxford NNS and AstraZeneca , uses HEK - 293 NNS . Both have received U.S. NN commitments of , respectively , $ 456 CD and $ 1.2 CD , if they meet milestones , through the Biomedical Advanced Research NNP Authority ( BARDA ) . Another NN that relies on HEK - 293 , being developed by CD NNS owned by the billionaire scientist and businessman Patrick Soon - Shiong , made an earlier , Warp Speed JJ list of 14 promising candidates , according to a press release from CD of NNS , NantKwest . Prentice VBZ : “ As they are choosing — BARDA and the Warp Speed NNS — what NNS to move ahead , they should at least recognize that there is some portion of the population who MD VB an alternative NN they can take in good conscience . ” Caplan disagrees . “ If you are VBG to VB the NN should n’t fund things that a minority of NNS object to , you will have a very JJ list of things that wo n’t VB funded by the NN , from research on weapons of NN to contraceptive research . ” The NNP administration has restricted the NN of JJ fetal tissue from elective abortions in biomedical research . CD NN RB , it adopted a policy that forbids NNS at the National Institutes of NNP ( NIH ) from using fetal tissue from elective abortions in their studies . And it imposed an extra layer of review on non-NIH NNS seeking agency funding to do research using such tissue . But the policy did not stop either group from using decades - JJ fetal NN lines IN HEK - 293 and NNP .C6 . * Clarification , 8 June , 12:10 p.m. : This story has been updated to clarify that the Vatican approves of Catholics receiving NNS manufactured using JJ fetal NNS only in the absence of alternatives ."

There ’s no easy NN to develop a NN . Each experimental candidate has about a six percent chance of making it to NN , about half the estimate for traditional drugs . Developing NNS is getting more complex and costs are VBG up . “ NN NN is facing a NN , ” according to Stanley Plotkin , a scientist pivotal in developing the rubella jab in the 1960s and who now advises Sanofi Pasteur MSD , writing in a NNP England Journal of Medicine comment . The culprits are JJ : more stringent JJ NN and NN rules introduced over the last decade , costly production , the “ lowest hanging fruit ” already developed and a difficult business NN , which some VBP so far as to call dysfunctional . Amid these trends , demand is rising . RB at a record pace for industry , several NNS to protect against the Ebola NN that killed more than 11,000 NNS last NN have been tested , but there is still no licensed product . Demand for NNS for Lyme NN , tuberculosis , and JJ more infectious NNS are RB needed , according to the JJ NN experts . And there are spot shortages RB in developed NNS . For example , a shortage of tuberculosis NNS in France prompted Sanofi Pasteur MSD to hand out shots initially meant for Poland last month . So far , a concerted JJ effort eradicated CD NN with NN — smallpox in the 1980s — showing what is possible with broad coordination . A major hurdle the industry faces is meeting the fragmented demand across Europe ’s markets , according to Andrea Rappagliosi , NN of NNPS Europe , an industry group . Immunization schedules vary by NN , requiring different doses and frequency of jabs . “ This does n’t ease access to a complex product , ” which takes up to CD NNS to develop once an order is placed , VBD Rappagliosi , who RB sits on the executive committee of the Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture . NNS are made using the NN - causing NN or bacteria , but in a form that is essentially harmless , either by weakening it , killing it , or extracting part of the NN or bacteria . This prompts the immune NN to develop antibodies against the NN . Given the complexity in NN and the high risks involved , the rewards need to be sizeable to attract investors . The industry VBZ it costs between $ 200 and $ 900 CD to develop a NN , with an estimated 70 percent of that dedicated to quality NN , according to the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations . But some are skeptical that NN costs are the biggest hindrance to better and faster NNS . Where the NN goes Just a handful of NNS — GlaxoSmithKline , Pfizer , Merck and Sanofi Pasteur MSD — VBP the majority of the NN , which inflates prices , critics VBP . “ The [ research and NN ] NN is broken , ” VBD Kate Elder , NNS policy adviser at Médecins Sans Frontieres . “ Priorities are chosen VBN on where the NN is … NNS predominantly in the developed NN , ” she VBD . MSF , which buys drugs in bulk for their work in developing NNS , VBZ that although the number of NNS against which NNS are advised to be vaccinated has doubled since 2000 , the cost of that NN package has multiplied 68 - fold . NNS employ “ tiered pricing ” dependent upon a NN ’s relative wealth and need . Low - income NNS qualify for NNS via GAVI , a JJ - private partnership that strikes voluntary pricing deals with pharma ; however middle - income NNS do not , meaning access can be worse than in poorer NNS . And groups IN MSF VBP it is impossible to tell how much it costs to develop a NN because NNS are not completely transparent about R&D spending . GSK VBZ its NN prices have increased less than 1 percent in the last six NNS , according to the NN ’s Chief NNP Officer for NNS , Thomas Breuer . “ It ’s an oligarchy , yes . But CD of the reasons NNS IN Sanofi Pasteur and GSK can provide NNS for a reasonable price is because they operate on such a JJ scale , ” he VBD . He points out that Glaxo is not only targeting NNS in wealthy NNS . It has developed a malaria NN at a cost of $ 350 CD ( €307 CD ) , with no profit expected . Other gaps in NN NN tend to be filled by philanthropic organizations such as the Bill & Melinda NNP Foundation . They focus exclusively on less profitable but devastating NNS , such as malaria and dengue fever , most prevalent in developing NNS . CD NN hailed as a success story by industry is Prevnar 13 , which protects against pneumococcal pneumonia caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae . The product has generated cumulative NNS of $ 25 CD for NN NN Pfizer since it acquired the jab in 2009 through its purchase of Wyeth . Last NN was a NNS record . Success is thanks to demand not only in the developing NN , but RB in wealthy NNS . Prevnar is made by isolating compounds on the NN of the bacteria . But Elder of MSF VBZ Prevnar illustrates what ’s wrong with the NN NN . “ This is CD of the NN ’s best selling NNS , but only CD NNS sell it : Pfizer and GSK , ” she VBD , referring to Glaxo , which sells a similar version . “ Pneumococcal pneumonia is the leading NN of death in NNS under five … If you VBP to improve access , you have to improve competition , ” she added . British biotech Absynth Biologics plans to launch JJ - in - NN NNS for a NN to prevent methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , a major problem in western hospitals , in 2018 . But not without NN : More than 60 percent of their revenue comes from a NN biotech fund , with the rest from private equity . “ Without Innovate U.K. funding , I do n’t VB we MD be where we are at the moment , ” she VBD . But that fund now looks under threat after U.K. Chancellor George Osborne announced in autumn his intention to switch from grants to loans . Philanthropic funding to pay for NNS RB is n’t guaranteed . “ GAVI buys common NNS , but that ’s on a charity basis and there are major constraints in the JJ term when they start losing funding and donors , ” VBD Elder of MSF . Europe , for its part , helps by supporting promising research into NNS through the Innovative Medicines Initiative and Horizon2020 . The NNP NNP Initiative , initially mandated to spur JJ NN for a malaria NN , now RB supports candidates for other NNS of poverty . It helps coordinate projects funded by the NNP Commission and others . NNS IN Absynth look to industry to develop and commercialize their NNS , since only JJ pharma has the means to recover from candidate failures . But this NN only serves to feed the consolidation trend . The industry is pushing for a pan-EU NNS plan to streamline things at the JJ level . The group wants a joint action from NNS to develop common immunization schedules , improve testing and availability , create flexibility in the purchasing NN , and spur greater confidence in NN . “ We understand the Commission is reaching out to member NNS , and there is a strong willingness to collaborate , ” Rappagliosi VBD . The Commission VBD it was down to member NNS to discuss and accept any joint action on NN and cooperation , “ as their commitment as regards JJ and JJ resources MD be required . ” If it did VB ahead , the plan MD fit well with Europe ’s strides to jointly buy NNS . After the 2009 H1N1 NN outbreak the NNP created the joint procurement of JJ countermeasures ; last month , Austria was the 23rd NN to sign up . To date no NNS have been jointly bought , but the JJ call for tender recently took place — albeit for JJ equipment — opening the door for more such approaches , and potentially offering an opportunity for greater NNS access ."

For the towers , at least , ghostly afterimages persist , albeit fading IN last night ’s nightmare . But the anthrax attacks , clearly linked to 9/11 and the Patriot Act , are IN lost letters , sent , but RB forgotten . Such disappearing acts are a staple of JJ NN these days . Memory has come upon hard times . With The 2001 Anthrax Deception , Professor Graeme MacQueen , founding Director of the Center for Peace Studies at McMaster NNP , calls us back to a careful reconsideration of the anthrax attacks . It is an eloquent and pellucid lesson in inductive reasoning and deserves to stand with David Ray Griffin ’s brilliant multi-volume dissection of the NN of that tragic September 11th . MacQueen makes a powerful NN for the linkage of both events , a tie that binds both to insider elements deep within the U.S. NN , perhaps in coordination with foreign elements . MacQueen ’s thesis is as follows : The criminal anthrax attacks were conducted by a group of conspirators deep within the U.S. NN who are linked to , or identical with , the 9/11 perpetrators . Their purpose was to redefine the Cold NNP into the JJ NN on Terror and in doing so weaken civil liberties in the NNP NNPS and attack other nations . Obviously these are explosive charges that demand substantial evidence connected logically in a compelling thesis . MacQueen , in countering anti-conspiratorial thinkers of the left and NN who approach such issues with minds IN beds already made up , explains his method thus : “ The tools of investigation are no different from those VBN to test other proposals . We VBP evidence and reason . In some NNS we will be able to VB confident assertions and in other NNS we shall have to acknowledge that we are speculating , but RB in this second NN we will do our best to ground our speculation in evidence . Ideology , national loyalty , outrage and ‘ common sense ’ will not do the job . ” There is no doubt that his thesis , backed up by abundant evidence and some intriguing speculation , is a NN NN , just IN the 9/11 Commission Report ’s explanation of 9/11 and the Bush administration ’s neo-con and NN assisted conspiratorial tying of Saddam Hussein and NNP Qaeda to 9/11 and the anthrax attacks . “ We MD have to look very hard to find anyone who does not hold a NN NN about 9/11 , ” he writes . “ And for this reason it is silly to denigrate NNS for holding a NN NN about this event . ” But good NN of any kind necessitates facts to VB it credible , and MacQueen provides a plethora of these , while the Bush administration made allegations and promises of evidence that was never delivered . He aptly quotes researcher Elias Davidsson ‘s evidentiary points concerning the 9/11 hijackers : Not only does MacQueen provide copious documented facts to support his NN , but he does it in a systematically logical NN that leaves the official story in shambles . If a crime were being prosecuted ( as it should , but NN was waged instead ) , MacQueen marshals a NN for conviction beyond a reasonable doubt . The anthrax letter attacks began on September 18 , 2001 when the JJ letters were mailed from Princeton , NNP Jersey . Between October 3 and November 20 twenty - CD NNS were infected with dried anthrax spores and five died . Between October 6 and October 8 especially highly refined and aerosolized anthrax letters were sent to CD key Democratic Senators , Thomas Daschle and Patrick Leahy . Before October 3 when the JJ NN , that of Robert Stevens who died CD days later , was diagnosed , the NNP claimed that “ no NN except the perpetrators knew … that the attacks were in progress . ” Yet The NNP York Times , between September 12 and October 3 , made reference to the possibility of biological or chemical terrorist attacks 76 times , 27 references specifically to anthrax . JJ of these warnings came from NN leaders . Of course the Times was home to Judith Miller , notorious for her deceptions regarding Iraq ’s WMD , and whose book Germs : Biological Weapons and NNP ’s Secret NNP , was about to be published in the JJ few days in October . In that book Miller FW al. assert that Iraq might VB a terrorist group to unleash a bioweapon against the NNP NNPS . Just coincidentally , throughout the month of October as the anthrax attacks became JJ , the Bush administration and the mainstream NN pushed the claim that NNP Qaeda ( already accused of 9/11 ) and Saddam Hussein ( slyly implicated by innuendo ) were responsible for the anthrax attacks . Once the U.S. started bombing Afghanistan on October 7 , alleged NNP Qaeda retaliation enhanced the claim . No evidence was presented . The Washington Post , vying with The NNP York Times for Cassadran bragging rights , had published a September 27 article “ NNP Qaeda NNP Have Crude Chemical Capabilities . ” This double foreign group suggestion – that Bin Laden ’s group , NN - sponsored by Iraq , sent the anthrax spores – was promoted vigorously throughout October . The crude anthrax letters written to Tom Brokaw of NBC NNP and Senator Daschle with their 09 - 11-01 headings and Muslim extremist language , released to the NN on October 23 , seemed to clinch the NN . By October 26 , once Bush had signed the Patriot Act , that NN began falling apart , but not before the CD Democratic Senators , Daschle and Leahy , who had resisted ramrodding the bill into law , had received their own lethal anthrax letters as possible reminders . When R. W. Apple Jr. wrote a NNP York Times front page article on October 18 , “ City of NNP , City of Fears , ” and VBD , “ the NN has been caught completely by surprise by the anthrax attacks , ” he MD not have VBN about the exercise termed Dark Winter , conducted four months earlier on June 22 - 23 , though PRP MD VB he might have VBN of the plethora of references to anthrax in his own paper in the few weeks before the attacks became VBN . Maybe he thought the Bush administration did n’t read the NNP York Times for intelligence . MacQueen , in a greatly significant piece of sleuthing , however , lets us VB about Dark Winter , a biological warfare simulation planned and conducted by Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies / Center for Strategic and International Studies at Andrews NNP Force Base with uncanny parallels to the actual anthrax attacks . Some oddities follow . Dark Winter had anonymous letters sent to the mainstream NN with threats of anthrax . Dark Winter claimed that the perpetrators are probably NN - sponsored international terrorists . Dark Winter claimed that “ a prominent Iraqi defector is claiming Iraq arranged the bioweapons attacks on the U.S. through intermediaries . ” Dark Winter concludes that the attacks necessitate harsh restrictions on civil liberties , possibly Martial Rule . Dark Winter has a fictional television anchor announce that “ still no group claims responsibility for unleashing the smallpox NN , but NCR has learned that Iraq MD have provided the technology behind the attack to terrorist groups VBN in Afghanistan . ” And yes , not to be missed , we learn that Dark Winter ’s simulation ’s actors included Apple ’s NNP York Times ’ colleague Judith Miller , soon to be the NNP York Times best - selling author of Germs , playing a reporter for the NNP York Times ; James Woolsey , JJ NNP Director and supporter of The Project for the NNP NNP NN ( we ’ll need a JJ Pearl Harbor , folks ) ; and Jerome Hauer , a member of the Committee on the Present Danger , and “ an important figure in the linking of the 9/11 attacks and the anthrax attacks , ” who played the FEMA director . Once the NN ’s accusations against NNP Qaeda and Iraq fell apart but the Patriot Act had become law , NSA spying commenced , and the NN in Afghanistan proceeded apace , the NNP changed its tune and pursued the lone wolf perpetrator NN , RB accusing a scientist named Steven Hatfill and then , after he sued and eventually received $ 5.82 CD in compensation , they accused Bruce Ivins , a scientist working on an anthrax NN at Fort Derrick in Maryland . MacQueen shows in detail how that claim came apart and resulted in a NN without credibility but with Ivins committing suicide . But , he concludes , the Ivins accusation served its purpose of diverting attention from the real reason for the anthrax attacks and its culprits . Finally , MacQueen details how the anthrax evidence leads to some of the alleged 9/11 hijackers in Florida as they lay down a trail of incriminating “ evidence ” we were meant to follow , linking crop - dusters / anthrax to 9/11 . Mohamed Atta , the alleged 9/11 ringleader , supposedly went into a U.S. Department of Agriculture office seeking a $ 650,000 loan to buy and enlarge a crop-duster . He made sure the agent knew and MD spell his name , and when she balked at the loan , “ he asked what MD stop him from VBG IN her desk , cutting her throat , and taking the NN from the JJ safe in the office . ” He then admired a photo of Washington , D.C. , asked to buy it , inquired about security at the NNP Trade Center , implied he was associated with NNP Qaeda , and told her that Bin Laden “ ‘ MD someday be VBN as the NN ’s greatest leader . ’ “ MacQueen sardonically comments , “ And that is the story of how a terrorist leader , engaged in a top - secret operation , sought a NN loan to VB him with his plan . ” For CD familiar with Lee Harvey Oswald ’s ( or his double ’s ) antics to VB himself unforgettable on visits to a car dealership and a rifle range before JFK ’s assassination , the Atta charade should ring a bell . MacQueen makes a powerful NN that the various crop-duster incidents were “ disinformation ” and that their purpose was to link 9/11 to the anthrax attacks and , notably , to Iraq . He notes that it was RB at this NN that the fictitious story of Atta meeting with an Iraqi intelligence agent in Prague was widely circulated to “ solidify this connection . ” He argues that once the NNP admitted that the anthrax attacks were not a foreign operation but the claim had served its purpose , the crop - duster stories vanished into obscurity . However , he concludes , “ Given that the anthrax attacks were a domestic operation , and given that the alleged hijackers were implicated in that operation prior to its occurrence , the conclusion cannot be avoided : the 9/11 attacks were RB a domestic operation . ” But as few can forget , on February 5 , 2003 at the UN Security Council , the Iraq / anthrax / crop - duster claim arose from its sleep in the infamous , fraudulent presentation by Colin Powell as he slyly tied Iraq back to the anthrax attacks and shilled for NN against Iraq . That feat of propaganda was but CD of at least 532 occasions when eight top members of the Bush administration made at least 936 JJ statements on Iraq ’s possession of weapons of mass destruction and its links to NNP Qaeda , according to a NN conducted by The Center for NNP Integrity and the Fund for Independence in Journalism and released in 2008 . Anyone concerned about the NN behind 9/11 and the anthrax attacks should read this profoundly important book . It is filled with tight argumentation backed by solid evidence , and RB the speculative parts ring true . In closing I will mention MacQueen ’s fascinating penultimate chapter wherein he speculates about the significance of the repeated word “ unthinkable ” by the NN and NN officials following George W. Bush ’s NN of the term “ rethink the unthinkable ” in a NNP 1 , 2001 speech at the National Defense NNP . The mainstream NN VBD the word “ unthinkable ” repetitively throughout October 2001 when referring to the anthrax attacks . And CD of the early anthrax threatening letters sent to Tom Brokaw , begins : “ The Unthinkabel ” ( sic ) – showing , of course , how Muslim terrorists ca n’t spell English . “ There is a pattern here , ” MacQueen writes . Words matter , and those repeated enough matter more , words such as ground zero , homeland , and unthinkable . “ He who wants to persuade should not put his trust in the JJ argument , ” Joseph Conrad wrote in Lord Jim . “ The NN of sound has always been greater than the NN of sense . ” MacQueen has chosen sense through argument , and rather than dismissing his as unthinkable , thinking NNS everywhere should engage it . The 2001 anthrax letter attacks in the NNP NNPS killed five NNS and wounded dozens . They were widely blamed on extremist Muslims and their backers and VBN to support the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq . They were RB VBN to justify and hasten the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act , which was being presented to Congress just as the JJ anthrax victim grew ill . In October 2001 , CD of the hypotheses that gained ground was that of the Double Perpetrator , the claim that NNP - Qaeda was carrying out the attacks with the support of Iraq . Much evidence was put forth to support this Double Perpetrator hypothesis but independent NNS soon discovered that the anthrax spores came from a domestic lab in the US serving the NN and intelligence communities , not from NNP - Qaeda or Iraq . The NNP then quickly claimed that an individual was responsible for the attacks and began noisily looking for this “ lone wolf . ” In 2008 the Bureau named Dr. Bruce Ivins of the US Army NNP Institute of Infectious NNP as the “ anthrax killer . ” Although the NNP remains committed to the Ivins hypothesis , the NN has been disintegrating for the last three NNS . Currently , it is justly held in contempt not merely by NNS who worked with Ivins but by JJ journalists as well as several US senators . But this raises the question : if Ivins did not commit this crime , who did ? This book presents evidence to support the following points : ( a) The anthrax attacks were carried out by a group of perpetrators , not by a “ lone wolf . ” The attacks were , therefore , the result of a NN — by definition a plan by CD or more NNS , made in secret and resulting in an immoral or illegal act . ( b) The group that carried out this crime consisted , in whole or in part , of insiders deep within the US NN apparatus . ( c) These insiders were the same NNS who planned the 9/11 attacks (d) The anthrax attacks were meant to facilitate a seizure of NN by the executive branch of NN through intimidation of Congress and US civil society . They were RB designed to achieve JJ acquiescence to and support for the redefinition of US foreign policy , replacing the Cold NNP with a JJ and aggressive JJ conflict framework , the JJ NN on Terror ."

NNP RB has voiced NN skepticism , on NNP and during CD of the primary debates when he VBD that NN has gotten “ totally out of NN . ” In that debate he went on to VB , “ I am totally in favor of NNS , but I VBP smaller doses over a longer period of NN . ” A NNP spokeswoman VBD late Tuesday that while he “ enjoyed ” his conversation with Kennedy , he had not yet commissioned a panel . “ The NN - elect is exploring the possibility of forming a commission on NN , which affects so JJ families ; however no decisions have been made at this NN , ” VBD Hope Hicks . Those are views unsupported by scientific evidence and dismissed as NN NN by experts who find their revival alarming . NN prevents millions of deaths IN the NN each NN . Once common childhood killers can return if support for immunization wanes : During a CD NN outbreak that started at Disneyland , JJ who fell ill were unvaccinated . Repeated scientific studies in the U.S. and abroad have VBN no evidence that NNS in general or those with thimerosal VBP NN . That preservative has been removed from routine childhood immunizations ; while it remains in some NN NNS , there are thimerosal - free versions . “ The NN has spoken . Thimerosal is a dead issue , ” VBD Dr. Paul Offit , a NN researcher at NNP ’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a critic of anti-vaccine groups . “ It is concerning . You have as a NN - elect a NN denialist . ” Beyond thimerosal , research has discredited concerns that NNS VBP too JJ NNS at once . “ Delaying NNS only leaves a child at NN of NN , ” VBD Stein and Remley of the pediatricians ’ group . It ’s not just NNS who gain , they noted : Widespread NN lowers the spread of NN that RB threatens the elderly or NNS with weak immune systems . lt ’s not clear what Kennedy described as a “ commission on NN safety and scientific integrity ” MD do . Already , there is a National NNP Advisory Committee that advises the NN on NN safety and other issues , in addition to regulation and oversight by NNS at the Food and NNP Administration and the Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention . The NNP Academy of Pediatrics offered to work with the incoming NNP administration “ to share the extensive scientific evidence demonstrating the safety of NNS . ”"

Aides to NNP NNP have touted NN prospects , but they ’ve RB tried to de-couple significant progress toward an immunization protocol from the need to return to workplaces , schools and JJ NN , as JJ NNS are now moving to do . “ Everything does not depend on a NN , ” NNP and NNP Services Secretary Alex Azar VBD on CNN ’s “ NN of the Union , ” echoing language VBN CD days earlier by NNP when he announced an ambitious JJ - private initiative to achieve widespread inoculation by January . “ NN or no NN , we ’re back , ” NNP VBD Friday . With the U.S. death toll approaching 90,000 , JJ NN experts described the NN ’s NN timetable as ambitious — perhaps overly so . “ Everything MD have to break in the JJ NN , and there are JJ ways that it might not work , ” VBD Tom Inglesby , director of the Center for NNP Security at Johns Hopkins NNP , interviewed on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ” “ So I do n’t VB we should bank on it , ” he VBD , calling a NN this NN “ far from a sure thing . ” Similar caution was voiced by Tom Frieden , a JJ head of the Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention . Interviewed on “ Fox NNP Sunday , ” he VBD a NN was “ the single most important weapon we MD develop against this NN , ” but “ we do n’t have CD yet . ” “ We hope we will , ” Frieden VBD . “ We hope it will be soon , but we can not count on it . ” RB if a NN is developed , logistical challenges to mass inoculation MD be daunting , VBD JJ Food and NNP Administration head Scott Gottlieb . “ A lot of things can VB wrong , ” Gottlieb VBD on CBS ’ “ Face the Nation . “ “ A lot of things can be delayed . It ’s very hard to VB to the point where you ’re VBG at high , high quantities . ” The U.S. has the NN ’s highest VBN tally of NN infections , with more than 1.5 CD confirmed NNS . But Azar VBD an overall plateau in NNS and deaths was ample grounds for moving ahead with restarting the NN . “ We are in a position to be able to reopen now , ” Azar VBD on CNN . He RB played down any alarm over televised images of packed bars and restaurants in NNS that have eased shutdowns , casting those who fail to follow physical - distancing guidelines as a minority . “ In any individual instance , you ’re VBG to VB NNS doing things that are irresponsible , ” he VBD . “ That ’s part of the freedom that we have here in NNP . ” Other NNP allies VBD similarly benign language to describe crowding in JJ places and newly reopened establishments . “ Well , I certainly VBP a small subset of Wisconsinites celebrating a little freedom , ” VBD Sen. Ron Johnson ( R - Wis. ) , interviewed on CNN . But he VBD most NNS were “ being very responsible ” in terms of mask - wearing and physical distancing . Azar RB VBD that predicted spikes of infection had not materialized in NNS such as Georgia and Florida , which moved quickly to reopen , although he acknowledged that it was “ still early days . ” An upsurge in illness probably MD take a couple of weeks to detect since JJ NNS do n’t develop NNS RB away . Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio , a Republican who has sometimes challenged NNP ’s push for a speedy end to shutdowns , VBD he hoped to avoid a resurgence in his NN as restrictions are eased . “ We certainly hope we do n’t VB that , ” he VBD on CNN , noting that “ so much is in every individual ’s NN . ” Experts such as Inglesby VBD an easing in the growth of the U.S. caseload should be seen as proof that shutdowns worked , rather than a signal that they should not have been imposed in the JJ place . “ I VBP lockdowns were necessary , ” he VBD . “ They actually have changed the course of the epidemic in the NNP NNPS . ” He VBD with the curve moving in the JJ direction , it was “ now appropriate for NNS to be thinking about how to very carefully reopen , and do it as safely as possible . ” Frieden , the JJ CDC head , predicted a JJ and uneven course for outbreaks in individual NNS , warning that too - rapid lifting of restrictions MD bring painful JJ setbacks . “ We ’re likely to VB multiple waves in different parts of the NN , ” he VBD . “ If we VBP too fast , it will backfire . ” NNP spent the weekend at Camp David , the presidential retreat in Maryland , holding strategy sessions on subjects including the NN push . “ We did a lot of terrific meetings , ” he told reporters upon returning to the White NNP on Sunday . “ Tremendous progress is being made on JJ fronts , including coming up with a cure for this horrible plague that has beset our NN . ” At the same NN , a senior aide unleashed an angry JJ tirade at Richard Bright , a NN expert turned whistleblower who told Congress last week that the administration ignored early warnings about the perils of the NN . White NNP trade advisor Peter Navarro , appearing on ABC ’s “ This Week , ” VBD Bright , who was ousted from his post as the head of a federal JJ research agency and refused reassignment to a lesser post , had “ deserted ” the administration at a moment of “ tragedy . ” “ We MD have VBN him on the battlefield , ” VBD Navarro , who refused an invitation to testify before the same congressional subcommittee as Bright did ."

Q : My daughter is CD NNS JJ . We got her checked for NN as she does not respond to her name and neither does she speak any word . Both of us are working due to which we are not able to interact with her at all ; hardly 5 - 10 minutes in the day . She stays with her grandparents who take care of her needs IN food , bath etc. but they do not interact with her either . She keeps watching TV all the NN . She has started doing things IN drinking NN from tumbler etc. only after learning it from TV . She does not respond to her name . Till now none of us call her by any particular name . We VBP different names or no name at all . She plays on her own , takes care of herself IN walking carefully on slippery floor or catching hold of railing while on steps . But she does not walk on slopes and if she does , she takes calculated steps . She does not have any eye contact with us . Though it has improved in last few days but is still minimal . She does not stick to CD toy for RB and soon gets bored of it . She does not speak any meaningful words IN mama or papa . She does not interact with any NNS of her own age group and we do n't VB if she will do so in future . She seems to VB older NNS ( 7 - 8 NNS JJ ) and tries to interact with them when she goes to the park - but walks off on her own if there is no immediate response from them . She does not try to interact or play with them . We showed her to a child specialist in Mumbai who advised a hearing test and a psychological test . Her hearing was normal but the psychological tests VBP that she has few autistic features . Hence her reaction MD be explained by lack of interaction and proper stimuli . Do we need to VB for another evaluation for NN ? If she indeed is autistic , then how to deal with this ? Is NN curable and will she be able to live a normal NN when she grows up ? Will she be dependent on someone in future ? A: The fact that your daughter has shown improvement with only a little stimulation from the NNS is very hopeful . Please ensure that you talk to her , looking at her and playing with her , when she is in the mood for it . It does seem a pity that she has spent CD NNS without much interaction with NNS or grandparents . Having TV on all the NN will just be noise , from the child 's point of view . Cut down her TV watching and give her things IN stuffed toys , building blocks and RB spoons and cups to play with and manipulate . Perhaps all four of you should agree on calling her by CD name , giving her a chance to develop an identity and a name . At this age , most NNS will move from CD activity to another . A short attention span by itself is not a NN for worry . It is good to hear that your daughter tries to VB contact with older NNS . Take her out to the park and to friends ' homes , where she can meet other NNS . VB her along if she is shy , but do not force her in any NN . Be inventive in capturing her interest . I VBP that story telling and reading from picture books will be good activities for the daily routine . Singing for her and with her will VB the home more lively for the little girl . Both NNS need to increase the NN spent with her . Your expressions of affection ( IN hugging her and holding her ) will give her a feeling of security . I VBP that cheerful and active interactions with the child will bring her close to the levels of speech and participation of other CD NN JJ NNS . Just to be sure that she has no special problem . You should consult a specialist in NN , if you continue to have the feeling that your child is not responsive ."

And the total of confirmed and probable NNS is 1,404 . There is CD additional recovered NN and this total is now 1,462 and there are just 21 remaining active NNS of NN - CD . There are no additional deaths to report . And , currently , there is nobody in hospital with NNP - CD following the discharge of a NN from Middlemore Hospital . Yesterday , our laboratories processed 4,279 tests . So our grand total of tests undertaken to date in NNP Zealand is 267,435 . Just an update on the NZ NNP Tracer app , there are now 422,000 registrations on that - an increase of 17,000 since yesterday . Just to remind NNS , that RB registering , which provides your up - to - date contact details with the Ministry of NNP is incredibly helpful for both you and for us and our wider efforts . So I continue to encourage to download that app . There are now over 17,000 QR posters available in businesses IN NNP Zealand , representing that unique NNP Zealand business number and those are the ones that work with the NZ NNP Tracer app . We 're launching another app today called Āwhina for NN care and professional staff . It provides them with access to information on the updated NN definition , on local JJ pathways , and on guidance IN NN of personal protective equipment amongst other things . We 're very pleased to be able to provide that information to our NN professional workforce so it 's available on their mobile device and it is updated as it is updated on our NN . We 've worked on that app with feedback and input from NNS across the NN . Finally , on another important topic , back in alert level 4 , I certainly noticed , and you MD well have , there were JJ NNS out walking or cycling to VB some fresh NN and physical activity to break the monotony of being inside . With less traffic on the roads , I have to VB , it was both easy and very enjoyable . Now there is obviously more traffic on the road under alert level 2 , but I MD encourage NNS to still try and build in some physical activity into your days . I VBP it 's getting more difficult with shorter and colder days , especially those mornings , but if you can retain that physical activity and build it into your day , perhaps for local trips - whether it 's school , work or to the shops - that will VB you stay well over winter . What you MD notice is your local councils providing more NN for walking and cycling to VB it easier . I commend the councils for doing this . I strongly encourage NNS to VB the most of that . So we 'll cooperate - continue to work , as we have been , with the Ministry of Transport , IN the benefits of walking and cycling where there is NN - CD or not . NN : MD you be comfortable with the NN moving to level 1 earlier than a month away ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : The advice we 've given , and this was the basis for the Cabinet discussion , and their decision on Monday was to RB of all to move the group side up to 100 and then -- size up to 100 and then remain in full alert level 2 for a period of CD weeks before moving to alert level 1 . But I 'm RB aware as the Prime Minister VBD on Monday they will be reconsidering the aLe letter level set -- alert level settings on June 2 . The ultimate decision remains with cabinet . NN : What why do we need to VB in alert level 2 for so RB ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : The main thing is we need to be certain that the cumulative result of activities means our border procedures are safe and secure especially as contemplate to a possible move to a bubble with NNP and / or more NNS coming into the NN . NN : Have you seen Winston Peters this morning VBD we should be in level 1 already and have a Trans - Tasman bubble arranged ? MD that be a workable possibility at the moment ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : I can't speak for the Deputy Prime Minister 's comments . What I can VB is that we are working hard on what alert level 1 will look IN . And RB separately , but obviously linked very hard with the airline industry , airports , foreign affairs and of course our counterparts in NNP , on what MD need to be in place to allow a Trans - Tasman bubble , the key thing is that MD require both NNS have confidence in the arrangement . NN : That MD be a no NN now , from today , tomorrow , immediate future ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : As I VBP , it is work actively under NN but it MD require decisions of cabinets of both NNS before a Trans - Tasman bubble MD VB ahead . Our job is to provide RB good advice on what needs to be in place both in terms of the pattern of NNS in each NN but RB at the border and on flights to VB VB sure there was no NN of transmission of any NNS between NNS . NN : I understand that that mask - wearing has been completed . Is that the NN ? When was an announcement made ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : There was a review of the scientific evidence and literature a couple of weeks RB , which is the NN on our NN . We have asked for further advice from our different technical advisory groups , including our overall technical advisory group . There is not a unanimous view on any of those groups but the weight of the rue is still that our current policy , which is not to either recommend or require widespread NN of masks , is the JJ NN at this point in NN . But we 're just finising -- finalising that . We will VB an updated statement available in the next day or CD . NN : Have you changed your position on wearing masks in places IN JJ transport ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : No , we 're not . The NN of masks needs to be put in the context of the situation we 're in RB now , alert level 2 VBG to alert level 1 with a record fifth day in - a - row with no JJ NNS and no evidence of community transmission . That 's the evidence that will keep NNS safe along with physical distancing . NN : Some VBP they MD VB to VB international students who VBP to VB at the NNP of Auckland 's NNP School to be able to enter the NN . Do you VB it 's safe to have some students come in if they 're paying to stay at hostels ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : This is a piece of work under NN , discussions are happening , we 're involved in them , led by our education colleagues . The key thing is , any group coming into the NN - there 's been publicity about some particular NNS with particular skills who 've come in over the last few weeks under a special exemptions policy , anyone who comes into the NN needs to do so in a NN that complies with that 14 - day self or managed isolation , except in very rare circumstances we can be very confident the NN is low . Yes , that does open up the option of international students coming into the NN and we MD need to VB sure that all the arrangements were in place to do so safely . NN : What alert level will the NN have to be at for you to feel comfortable to establish a Trans - Tasman bubble ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : I VBP that 's depend on both governments deciding the risks are able to be managed within an appropriate process . I VBP the VBD this on Monday - it is not dependent on us being in alert level 1 but dependent on decision - makers in both NNS agreeing to it . NN : VBG back to allowing NNS back into the NN , MD you still recommend they stay at hotels in Christchurch or Auckland or MD you envisage a NN they MD self - isolate at home as we did before ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : At this point in NN , because the border is so important for us to keep the infection out of the NN , we 're maintaining the position that it requires , either , quarantine or supervised isolation at CD of the facilities that are setup in Auckland or Christchurch . NN : Is is this the JJ NN -- is this the JJ NN there 's been no - CD in hospital for NNP - CD since the NN lockdown began ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : I VBP it is , absolutely , yes , we 've had a number of NNS in hospital . Never a JJ number but I VBP this is the JJ NN in a couple of months we have n't had someone in hospital . That 's another good position to be in . NN : Yesterday you spoke a bit about exemptions you signed off on . Do you sign off on them all ? How JJ have you signed off on for NNS in the screen industry ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : The ones in screen industry I do n't sign - off on . They 're signed off by Minister Twyford and they 're related to specific commercial ventures . The very small number I sign off on are IN workers with very particular skills , IN there were some engineers in Europe what came to fix the so - called "" poo "" pipe here in Wellington . And CD I mentioned yesterday who is here to repair X - ray machines . The ones about commercial ventures are not something I sign off on . However , they have to comply with the very strict JJ NN measures in place for earn else . They -- everyone else . They require the 14 - day quarantine period . NN : Do you VB how JJ have been signed off on ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : In the latter category ? REPORTER : In both . Dr Ashley Bloomfield : I 've signed off on in a handful . I should VB those are NNS who do n't need to do the 14 - day quarantine , assuming they 've fulfilled a number of requirements . In the NN of the other group , it 's somewhere between CD and 200 but Minister Twyford is the NN who will VB the exact numbers there . NN : On that point of allowing further NNS in , some of the arrangements that these NNS are quarantining overseas rather than quarantining when they VBP here ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : Not at this point in NN . But that is something we are looking at . You MD need to be comfort in the quarantine arrangements in the - at the destination , where they 're coming from - sorry , at the point of where they 're coming from and be confident they were following the same strict JJ NN measures we have in place here . It is something we 're looking at a possibility . NN : Is that something we MD move to of sort of there being a visa or something requirement and proof that they have managed to self - isolate and / or quarantine in their NN of residence before coming to NNP Zealand and then they MD VB straight into their role ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : Yes , that 's absolutely an option . Another option - we 're seeing some NNS do this - is requiring testing before NNS depart from their departure point in a timely NN . Both those are options . But at this point in NN , we 're not using either of those options but they are options for the future . NN : Note that the NN 's response to PPE requests internationally is currently no , can you VB which NNS have asked for NN with PPE ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : No , I do n't VB which NNS have asked that but we can provide that information . NN : You MD have seen NNS wearing makeshift masks over the mouth , nose area . Does that offer any value for NNS taking those measures ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : I 'm not discouraging NNS from doing it . If you 're VBG to VB a mask or face covering , VB how to do that safely . It makes it RB more careful to VB careful hand hygiene . Because that 's where the potential for using face masks can be , with touching inanimate objects and then touching the face . We have done reviews where NN care staff MD have got infected from - on more than CD occasion we VBP it is from contaminated surfaces RB though they were wearing full PPE . I can't overstate the importance of NNS using good hand hygiene whether using a face covering or not . NN : Are you happy with where testing numbers are at ? It 's dropped off over the last couple of days . Is that to be expected ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : RB of all , we always VBP a drop over the weekend and that tends to flow through into the Monday and Tuesday numbers . It 's coming up again , I VBP , today . We were 4,279 tests processed yesterday . Yes , we will expect to VB the numbers come down because - for CD reasons . RB of all , through the last couple of months we 've been testing for NNS with NNS . We continue to do that , and that is that the vast majority of the testing that 's happening . Anyone who fits that NN information on our NN , which is very broad still . But secondly , we were doing a lot of testing to try and identify if there was any hidden NN out there in the community . Now that it 's clear it's not , we 'll be shifting the focus for that testing to the border because that 's the area where we 'll have the most NN . There is a very specific plan being developed IN that which CD it has been through cabinet and approved will become in operation from 8 June . It is testing NNS and looking for any breach at the border with more testing there . NN : Because of our success in tackling NN - CD , is it VBG to affect our chances if there 's a NN created internationally , will it affect our chances of getting the NN if we 're a NN as seen as doing well and does n't need it as badly as other NNS ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : I should n't VB so . It 's still a JJ NN off , for a start . Secondly , as you will have seen in the NN strategy that was publicised earlier in the week we have a number of irons in the fire there to VB sure that we have access to a NN as soon as PRP 's available , and RB planning for making sure that we can vaccinate our population . NN : Following on what you were saying there , JJ testing at the borders , does that mean we MD VB more NNS coming through the borders ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : Ah , regardless of whether we 're seeing more NNS coming through the borders what we 're looking at is whether we routinely test everyone coming through the border at some point during their quarantine period . But RB , it 's about testing of NNS who are working at the border , either at airports or ports , or in those quarantine facilities . So that will be where the focus of our asymptomatic testing will be . NN : Back to masks , where does the discrepancy lie at the moment ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : There are a range of views whether widespread mask VBP whether on JJ transport or in other JJ settings by the general NN is worth doing from a sense of that the benefits outweigh the potential risks at this point in NN . But it 's just CD of those things that 's under active conversation . NN : CD question from our sports NN . The Tokyo Olympics have been postponed to the middle of next NN . Do you VB a NN MD be ready by that NN , and do you VB the Olympics should VB ahead if there is n't a NN and you are VBG to have thousands of athletes RB ? Dr Ashley Bloomfield : I 'm prepared to answer most questions but I do n't VB I can offer any sound insights into that particular issue . I 'm sorry . OK . Thank you very much , everybody ."

Eight of these have already made it to JJ NNS in NNS , and another 94 are in the pre-clinical evaluation stage . These candidates RB fall into eight different categories of NN NN strategy that are being explored . While it still does n’t guarantee success , this is in effect the biological equivalent of hedging our bets in the hope that CD of the strategies will pay off . But if and when a successful NN is VBN , we still have to manufacture enough of it to immunise huge numbers of NNS all IN the NN . And how RB this will take , and what is involved , will depend on which strategy is VBN to work , because different NNS are made in different ways . Despite arguments about lack of preparedness concerning PPE and testing , the UK has been on the front NN when it comes to identifying suitable candidate NNS . It is leading the charge to ramp up production , having invested more than any other NN in doing so , according to the NN secretary , Matt Hancock . The UK’s CD leading candidate NNS , being developed by the NNP of Oxford and Imperial College London respectively , both VBP very different approaches that were already under investigation in the lab for other NNS . Oxford ’s candidate , ChAdOx1 nCoV - CD , uses a genetically modified chimpanzee adenovirus as a “ vector ” to carry the genetic sequence of a NN from the NN - CD NN to the JJ NN . The NN can then learn to recognise the NN and start producing antibodies to fight it . This is the same technique the NN previously developed for the closely related Mers NN , which showed promise in NN and early - stage JJ testing . RB NN NN takes NNS , but JJ JJ NNS for the Oxford NN candidate are underway , just three months after the genetic sequence of the NN was released for NN . This is thanks to a specialist adenovirus NN platform adapted as part of work by the EPSRC UCL - Oxford Future NNP NNP Research Hub ( Vax Hub ) , as well as next - generation gene sequencing methods that have enabled the NN to proceed at breakneck speed . Pharmaceutical NN AstraZeneca has announced it will develop , manufacture and distribute the NN ( if it ’s successful ) IN the NN . But to do this , it will need to find a NN to scale up production without critically affecting the supply of other vital NNS . JJ NN facilities are adept at producing millions of NN doses against influenza , NNS and polio . They have strategies in place to step up production at times of increased demand , such as for the annual winter NN NN . But we are in unprecedented times , and the JJ demand for a safe and effective NN NN will be on a scale never before seen , likely resulting in key production and distribution bottlenecks . NN production requires complex NN processes involving the production of living organisms that , in turn , generate the genetically - modified NN on which the NN is VBN . And we must VB the NN NN . These NNS will be administered to healthy NNS to generate immunity to the NN . Any faults MD VB their safety and a JJ - term loss of JJ confidence . But there is NN for cautious optimism . As we await the JJ NN outcomes for the Oxford NN , behind the scenes there has been a flurry of activity to adapt existing NN technologies and processes to VB the adenovirus vector it relies on . The NN process for the Oxford NN will begin by encoding the NN NN NN into the adenovirus vector . “ Producer NNS ” , RB JJ embryonic kidney ( HEK ) NNS , will then be VBN as mini-factories to produce the vector particles . The producer NNS will be grown at scale in a bioreactor , a vessel that tightly controls the JJ conditions to optimise NN growth . The NNS will then be put through a series of steps to purify and concentrate the final adenovirus vector , including filtration and centrifugation ( spinning it very fast in order to separate different particles ) . Finally , the solution will be formulated into a usable product and kept stable by storing it between 2 °C and 8°C . However , the final concentration of the solution can vary significantly , and it is the lack of an effective NN process to resolve this problem that limits current production on a mass scale . This will be the significant challenge AstraZeneca will face in translating the lab - VBN Oxford process to something akin to industrial NN . Of course , all these efforts will only come into play if the Oxford NN ( or potentially another in the same category ) is VBN to work . Other NN candidates , such as that being developed by Imperial , will require a substantially different NN process . In these unprecedented times , the NN ’s NN experts will have to work with unprecedented speed and innovation to deliver a NN to save potentially millions of lives and start returning society to normal ."

Horowitz , DMD , MA , MPH Author of thirteen books including the national bestseller , Emerging Viruses : AIDS & Ebola - Nature , Accident or Intentional ? and Death in the NN : Globalism , Terrorism and Toxic Warfare 4 -2-3 Abstract Rather than a JJ NN emergency , the "" Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome , "" generally called NNP , is best diagnosed as a "" Sickening and Repulsive Scam . "" This article argues that this unprecedented viral attack is , alternatively , an ingenious JJ experiment featuring institutionalized bioterrorism for widespread psycho-social NN . The outcome of this experiment , whether it leads to population reduction or not , depends on you . Background You are about to read much neglected truths pertaining to this bizarre JJ pneumonia - JJ illness called NNP . Authorities explain this acronym for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome as simply the latest threat in an ongoing series of attacks on humanity by mysteriously mutating "" supergerms . "" Yet , a careful NN of this multi- disciplinary subjectÊ reveals something amiss far more insidious and deadly than NN . This spreading scourge of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome stretching from Asia to NNP NNP has all the earmarks of a novel JJ experiment in population manipulation aimed to culture the mass mind for the arrival of "" the NNP NNP "" - a biological agent that will facilitate decimation of approximately a third to half of the NN 's population , in keeping with current official population reduction objectives . Naturally you MD be disinclined to VB the above sentence . Open - mindedness in this domain threatens exposure to a "" Twilight Zone "" of knowledge in which reality is far stranger than fiction . Your JJ instinct , therefore , might be to close this page in favor of the next NNP NN that promises more of the standard treatments broadcast on every official NN page and NN report on this subject . But , if you choose to have your worldview shattered by considering the little VBN truths surrounding Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome , then continue reading . . . . "" No great epidemic has ever evolved divorced from major socio- political upheaval . "" Leonard G. Horowitz , D.M.D. , M.A. , M.P.H . Emerging Viruses presentation , 1996 Introduction My name is Dr. Leonard Horowitz , and I will be your NNP tour guide on this NN . As a Harvard graduate in JJ NN , and expert in the fields of JJ sociology , behavioral NN , and emerging NNS , I am best VBN for my work exposing the man-made origin of HIV / AIDS in the national bestselling book , Emerging Viruses : AIDS & Ebola - Nature , Accident or Intentional ? ( Tetrahedron Press , 1998 ; 1-888-508-4787 ; http://www.healthyworlddistributing.com/detail.aspx?ID=4) This was my tenth book that JJ grassroots activists , JJ physicians and NNS included , made a national bestseller . U.S. NN documents that I reprinted for the JJ NN for the NN to VB were strong endorsements for this work . Included here are stunning and tragic contracts under which numerous AIDS - JJ and Ebola - IN viruses were bioengineered by the U.S. Army 's 6th leading biological weapons contractor - Litton Bionetics - a JJ subsidiary of the mega-military weapons contractor called Litton Industries . You can VB free information on this man-made NN - transmitted NN of AIDS at http://www.originofAIDS.com. Here I focus your attention on NN , and what mainstream sources of information are withholding about this JJ NN . This narrative was written immediately following my return from Total NNP 2003 - anÊ alternative JJ conference in Toronto , Canada , held March 27 - 30 , 2003 . I landed in Toronto the day that NNP began dominating front page headlines in every major newspaper in the NN . Five consecutive days of unprecedented NN blitz in Canada 's largest city over the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome left the entire population frightened and bewildered . Having been well - trained in NN NN promotion and persuasion methods from my behavioral NN studies at Harvard NNP , I concluded that something akin to a JJ experiment was underway . With NN , NNS were being frightened beyond reason , I realized . The classic definition of phobia was being manifested on a JJ , if not JJ , scale . Surely the NNP death rate , approximately 3 % , was insufficient NN for such widespread panic . The NN successfully whipped the Canadian population into a trembling mass of masked and quarantined "" sheeple . "" Officials were forced to direct the closing of hospitals , restaurants , schools , and workplaces with only CD deaths reported at the onset of the NN onslaught . Within a few days , more than a thousand healthcare workers volunteered for home quarantine because of NN . Otherwise , they faced legal arrest and incarceration as advised by the NNP NNP Organization . You will find JJ of these reports from Canada 's daily newspapers , documenting these facts , as well as incoming JJ press reports , in the archive files of this NN . Mission I have dedicated this NN to examining the JJ and political implications , as well as the correlates ( i.e. , things related to ) and antecedents ( i.e. , factors or events that predated or precipitated ) this JJ NN NN . By examining this illness 's etiology , which lies more in the realm of JJ politics , corporate profits , and population NN , than elsewhere , this information offers educated NNS an alternative to the fright and irrational behaviors promulgated by "" mainstream "" propagandists including NN sources and NN officials better VBN as "" spin doctors . "" Most intelligent persons will conclude from the following information that this JJ microbial attack was premeditated and precedent - setting . In other words , NNP is a well orchestrated JJ experiment . Who is behind this NN madness ? I accept the NN of triggering your "" NN NN "" buttons by identifying the widely recognized "" JJ JJ - JJ - petrochemical - pharmaceutical cartel "" as the only suspect that can wield the powers necessary to effect these frightening outcomes . Although you MD find it comforting to simply consider this a NN NN , I view NNP is a huge NN with very few witting villains . Clearly , what you are witnessing is a well organized terror NN carried out by mostly well - meaning , yet grossly ignorant , "" authorities "" - medically indoctrinated and virtually hypnotized "" Manchurian candidates "" if you will allow me to postulate . Indeed , NNS are dying from NN . Yet , I diagnose this illness , by JJ - sociological parameters , as a grotesque scam perpetrated for a greater purpose than simply fueling a multi-billion dollar "" cottage NN industry , "" as some analysts have written . Alternatively , I propose that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome , MD be best diagnosed by NNP 's telltale dependence on the propaganda VBN to herald its presence , prompt hysteria , and broadly engage JJ and JJ resources . In JJ intelligence circles this is called standard "" psychological operations "" ( PSYOPs ) . I further suggest this fright 's likeliest purpose is in facilitating evolving JJ and political agendas that ultimately include targeting approximately half the NN 's current population for elimination . Much of this will be accomplished , not with NN , but quite effectively and efficiently by the widely anticipated "" NNP NNP "" discussed later on this NN in a feature article written for the Associated Press by Emma Ross . "" [ T ] here 's fame , fortune , and JJ budgets in sounding the ' emerging infection ' alarm and warning of our terrible folly in being unprepared . "" Michael Fumento , National Post , March 28 , 2003 This concept of a microbiological Armageddon is not JJ to most readers . "" Experts "" have been predicting the arrival of a super - plague for decades . What is HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS about the mysterious and terrifying arrival of NNP is its timing . It arrived virtually synchronous with the JJ NN on terrorism , and the Anglo - JJ NN with Iraq . This is pathognomonic ( i.e. , symptomatic and characteristic ) of what is predicted and explained in the book , Death in the NNP : Globalism , Terrorism and Toxic Warfare ( Tetrahedron Publishing Group , 2001 ; http://www.healthyworlddistributing.com/detail.aspx?ID=3), a prophetically - titled text that predated the 9 - 11 attacks on NNP by several months , and provides a contextual analysis of this current condition and spreading plague of phobic deception . This work , and this NNP NN , in essence , offers insight into the broad application of a JJ form of institutionalizedÊ "" bioterrorism "" consistent with NN sponsored biological warfare . Saddam Hussein is VBN to have exposed populations in his and adjacent lands with biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction . These advancing infectious NN attacks in NNP NNP are sanctioned by JJ - pharmaceutical and allied JJ industrialists . They complement the JJ "" NN on Terrorism , "" and bioterror - influenced culture , as additionally profitable , population - controlling , threats . Perceiving Harsh Reality Versus Generally Promoted Myths What lay persons view as ever increasing madness in the NN IN them , is eerily consistent with earlier globalist NN tank recommendations for the NN and deployment , in the JJ millennium , of "" conflicts short of NN , "" and "" JJ substitutes for standard militarization . "" These developments were adequately detailed and referenced in Death in the NNP : Globalism , Terrorism , and Toxic Warfare ( http://www.healthyworlddistributing.com/detail.aspx?ID=3). As compared with the JJ and second NN wars , these smaller , more manageable , and better controlled conflicts , orchestrated events , and NN sponsored threats , were consistently selected options among foreign policy makers and NN officials beginning in the late 1960s . Henry Kissinger , for instance , as National Security Advisor ( NSA ) under Richard Nixon , oversaw foreign policy while considering Third NNP population reduction "" necessities "" for the U.S. , Britain , Germany , and other allies . This Bush nominee to direct the 9 - 11 NN investigation , a reputed NN criminal , then selected the option to have the Central Intelligence Agency ( NNP ) develop biological weapons , according to the U.S. Congressional Record of 1975 . Among these biologicals were germs far deadlier than the NNP agent ( thought to be a strain of NN ) . Under Kissinger 's watch as NSA , influenza and parainfluenza viruses were , for example , recombined with quick acting leukemia viruses ( acute lymphocytic leukemia ) to deliver a weapon that potentially spread cancer IN the NN . ( More on this later . ) These incredible realities have been generally neglected , if not officially secreted . Weapons selections IN these continue to the present day not simply by radical terrorist groups , but RB among a handful of JJ cartel industrialists that continue to sell weapons of mass destruction to those who can afford them . These conflicts short of major wars IN WWI and WWII , and NN NN substitutes ( such as the "" NN on AIDS , "" "" NN on Crime , "" "" NNP on Drugs , "" "" NNP on Terrorism , "" "" NNP on Cancer , "" the JJ protection movement , and the "" Star Wars "" Strategic Defense Initiative , all require sophisticated propaganda programs employing fear campaigns for JJ acceptance and popular support . These PSYOPS for command and NN warfare ( C2W ) , JJ and behavior experts correctly advise , best support a well - defined rapidly evolving "" Revolution in JJ Affairs "" ( RMA ) which is synonymous to a the evolution into "" a form of JJ slavery "" in which the captives - the NN 's population , including you and your loved ones - MD not perceive this enslavement . The RMA incorporates the NN of debilitating biological weapons and incapacitating chemicals , similar to the toxic carcinogenic organophosphate pesticides deployed against mosquitoes in the "" NN Against the West Nile NNP . "" These are often called "" non-lethal warfare "" agents , yet are indeed deadly . Death results slowly along with advancing mortality from such toxic exposures . Larger profits are made by allied pharmaceutical and JJ industrialists as victims of the "" non-lethal "" exposures die slowly , commonly in expensive hospitals and JJ - term care facilities , from chronic debilitating NNS . Most of these ailments , including the plethora of autoimmune NNS and newer cancers , were virtually non-existent 50 NNS RB . This fact , lone , strongly suggests a modern socio-economic and political NN . Unless you simply wish to VB it is NNP 's will or NN 's greed that has brought these conditions to bear upon humanity . "" NNS are all too willing to relinquish their civil rights and personal freedoms in the wake of such engineered frights . "" In recent decades , JJ NN tanks prescribed options for "" conflicts short of NN "" that included novel population NN policies and methodologies . These provided for : 1 ) the establishment of JJ profit centers as traditional JJ - scale wars were phased out by the JJ millennium . Ê Examples here include the JJ multi-billion dollar "" homeland security "" programs that emerged from post - 9/11 legislation , such as those securing NN travel and mail delivery . These are just CD examples of myriad evolving profit centers fueled by frights and institutionalized terror campaigns ; 2 ) the NN of advanced persuasion and population NN programs , with high tech methods of support , to facilitate "" a form of slavery "" in which humanity MD not realize it had become conditioned into relinquishing personal and JJ freedoms for the mirage of NN , safety , and security . These provided other profit centers and population NN options . Once habituated to modern lifestyle restrictions , such as enforced NN and travel restrictions , the general population might become virtually "" enslaved "" with little effective resistance , widespread pharmaceutical dependence ( particularly using anti-depressant drugs ) , through the NN of PSYOPs . NN distractions and manipulations were considered essential in achieving this objective ; and 3 ) lucrative depopulation methods to be employed , including the conditions and resources necessary for culling "" excess populations . "" NNP , when considered in light of these JJ and political impositions , can be clearly understood . NN for Profit By Friday , March 28 , 2003 , senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington , Michael Fumento , published a thesis in Toronto similar to the NN I advance here . This well regarded author of The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS : How a Tragedy Has Been Distorted by the NNP and Partisan Politics ( Regnery Gateway , 1990 ) provided an editorial titled "" Super - bug or Super Scare "" Ê published in the National Post ( p. A16 . ) . This included the following : It 's "" an incident of unprecedented scope and magnitude , "" according to Toronto NN officials , who warn Canadians to "" quarantine themselves , "" wear masks , and in some NNS stay home . Ontario NNP Minister Tony Clement has declared a "" NN emergency . "" The meda have dubbed it the "" mysterious killer pneumonia "" or "" super-pneumonia . "" But a bit of knowledge and perspective will kill this panic . Start with those scary tags , "" Mysterious "" in modern medicine RB means we have n't yet quite identified the NN , although we have now done so here . What 's been officially named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( NNP ) is CD or more strains of NN , commonly associated with colds . "" Killer pneumonia "" is practically a redundancy , since so JJ types of pneumonia ( there are more than 50 ) do kill . The real questions are : How lethal , how transmissible , and how treatable is this strain ? And the answers leave no grounds for excitement , much less panic . Super ? At this writing , NNP appears to have killed 54 NNS out of almost 1,400 afflicted according to the NNP NNP Organization , a death rate of less than 4 % . But since this only takes into account those ill enough to seek JJ NN , the actual ratio of deaths to infections is certainly far less . [ This is a tremendous understatement . ] In contrast , the 1918 - 1919 NN NN killed approximately a third of the 60 CD afflicted . Further , virtually all of the deaths have been in NNS with horrendous JJ care , primarily mainland China . In this NN , three NNS have died out of 28 afflicted according to NNP Canada , but that MD VB more about Canada 's vaunted national NN - care NN than about NN . In the NNP NNPS , 40 NNS have been hospitalized with NNS with zero deaths . Conversely , other forms of pneumonia kill more than 40,000 NNP Americans yearly . Transmissibility ? Each NN millions of NNP Americans alone contract the NN . Compre that with those 64 NN NNS diagnosed thus far and , well , you can't compare them . Further evidence that NN is hard to catch is that NN care workers and family members of victims are by far the most likely to become afflicted . Treatability ? "" There are few drugs and no NNS to fight this pathogen , "" CD wire service panted breathlessly . But there are RB few drugs to fight any type of viral pneumonia , because we have very few antiviral medicines . . . .Ê [ Consider RB approximately 97 % of NNS naturally defended themselves successfully against this plague . What did they , or their immune systems do JJ ? Why is this rarely , if ever , mentioned or investigated by any mainstream source ? Alternatively , Mr. Fumento mentions "" Ribovirin , "" which he VBZ , "" appears to be effective against NN . "" [ Is this another form of medically - sanctioned institutionalized bias that RB the well - intentioned Fumento expresses ? Consider the fact that NNP only existed a few weeks prior to Fumento 's editorial . In fact , the NN had been questionably cultured from NNP patients only days before Fumento 's wrote the above . Surely no JJ NNS matching Ribovirin with NN had ever been conducted . At best , then , this statement reflects either NN NN propaganda and / or NN official speculations . ] Fumento continued : "" So why all the fuss over this CD strain of pneumonia ? RB , never ignore the obvious : It does sell papers . But an added feature to this scare is the cottage industry that 's grown up IN so - called "" emerging infectious NNS . "" Some NNS truly fit the bill , with AIDS the classic example . Others , IN West Nile NNP in NNP NNP , are JJ to a given area . But there 's fame , fortune , and JJ budgets in sounding the "" emerging infection "" alarm and warning of our terrible folly in being unprepared . The classic example is Ebola NN , . . . [ Mr. Fumento downplays the Ebola threat here . ] Yet , you 'd almost swear that every out break of Ebola is actually taking place in Toronto or NNP York . . . . . . . The U.S. NN and various NNP JJ universities have RB seen these faux plagues as budget boosters . The U.S. Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention publishes a journal called Emerging Infectious NNPS , though in any given issue it's hard to find an illness that actually fits the definition . The U.S. Institute of Medicine just issued a report warning that the NNP NNPS is grossly unprepared to deal with emerging pathogens . Soothingly , however , it adds that it 's nothing that an injection of NN dollars can't cure . Meanwhile , a NN that emerged eons RB called malaria kills up to 2.7 CD NNS yearly . Another , tuberculosis , kills perhaps three CD more . Both afflict NNP Americans , albeit at very low rates . The JJ NN and headlines MD be in the so - called ' emerging NNS , ' but the cataclysmic illnesses come from the same JJ boring killers . In fact , there MD be no fatal illness that will VB fewer deaths in NNP NNP this NN than NNP . "" Michael Fumento concluded by asking , and challenging you to consider : "" How do our priorities VB so twisted ? There 's your mystery ? "" Favored JJ Victims of NN and Other SCAMS in the RMA Contrary to Mr. Fumento's well considered conclusion that NNP boosts budgets of those who sound alarms loudest , the mainstream NN has consistently attempted to have you VB otherwise . CD article in Canada 's leading JJ newspaper , the NNP Post , on March 31 , 2003 , heralds , "" NN NN begins to take toll on JJ NN . "" With no mention of the far larger number of NNS and industries that profit from such plagues , and the fears surrounding them , reporter Jacqueline Thorpe 's editor assigned her to focus on the airline and tourism industries that are "" particularly hard hit . "" She wrote : "" Businesses in Singapore have shut down , planes over Hong Kong are empty and thousands of NNS in Toronto have been forced into quarantine as a deadly pneumonia NN adds yet another strain to the beleaguered JJ NN . While severe acute respiratory syndrome ( NNP ) MD not be as debilitating as NN in Iraq , slumping stock markets or a weak U.S. labor NN , it is already starting to take its toll on some Asian economies and the RB - suffering tourism industry . . . . In Hong Kong , where the number of infections leapt by 60 to 530 over the weekend and 13 NNS have died , economists at JPMorgan Chase estimate the NN MD lose 0.2 % to 0.5 % of gross domestic product every month from the drop in tourism and private consumption . . . . Businesses in JJ Chinese shopping districts [ in Toronto ] have reported a sharp drop in business . Dennis Yuent , a merchant in Pacific Mall in Toronto -- Ê NNP NNP 's largest shopping mall - VBD his NNS have dropped by about 70 % since the NNP scare began . "" Notice that the expert bankers at JPMorgan Chase , and Ms. Thorpe , failed to mention the stunning growth in JJ / pharmaceutical / security / and law enforcement sectors , and the increase in "" gross domestic product "" due to NN and similar scams . In the weeks and months following the 9 - 11 attacks on NNP , I traced the widely publicized anthrax mailings "" mystery "" to U.S. Central Intelligence Agency ( NNP ) commissioned biological weapons contractors with ties to Britain 's MI6 , Porton Down , the Anglo - JJ pharmaceutical cartel , including the Bayer , Hoecsht , Baxter and Merck Corporations , and ultimately to George Soros - a JJ banking and investment industrialist and chief NN manager for Europe 's wealthiest oligarchy - owners of the Genomic Institute that performed the DNA sequencing on behalf of the anthrax NN maker / British Porton Down subsidiary , Bioport . A complete expos on this topic is provided at =http://www.tetrahedron.org/articles/anthrax/anthrax_espionage.html._ADD China 's Threat and the Anglo - JJ RMA It seems suspiciously convenient that the travel industry , and Asian travel in particular , MD be the greatest victims at a NN when globalists ( i.e. , JJ industrialists including members of the ultra- rich ) have directed JJ and political policies consistent with the RMA and "" conflicts short of NN "" agenda . Reducing travel helps to secure wide ranging RMA objectives . VB about it . Less mobile populations , and less NNS in general , are easier to VB , especially with increased exposure to television while having to waste their NN at home . This is entirely consistent with the "" Changing Images of Mankind "" advanced by Willis Harmon for Anglo - JJ JJ and business interests . The effect of this similar to forced "" quarantine . "" Is n't this consistent with a "" form of slavery in which humanity MD not VB it had become enslaved ? "" NNS are all too willing to relinquish their civil rights and personal freedoms in the wake of such engineered frights . The passage of the infamous "" Homeland Security Act "" in NNP , and its counterpart in Canada , are classic examples of this societal direction , forced legislation , and egregious manipulation . How convenient that Asia , and China in particular , is VBN to be the origin of this NNP JJ scourge at a NN when Chinese - Anglo - JJ relations are strained to VB the least . In the days preceding the emergence of the JJ NNP NNS , NNP raced to the Pacific Rim to impact escalating aggressions on the Korean peninsula . Communist China -a "" most favored "" trading partner with NNP , is politically allied with several JJ enemies , including those VBN to possess weapons of mass destruction , including Iraq . Coincidental ? Not likely when viewing the larger political picture involving the Ango - JJ oligarchy 's RMA and instigated "" conflicts short of NN . "" Ultimately , "" We the NNPS "" have become the greatest victims of this latest fright , and the larger political agendas it serves . The NN 's Role in NN : Setting a Precedent Consider the fact the NN 's mainstream has been heavily influenced , if not entirely controlled , by multi-national corporate sponsors protecting and advancing the interests of a relatively small number of JJ industrialists ( I have called "" globalists ; "" and others VBP the "" ruling elite , "" or "" JJ oligarchy "" ) . RB recall that the focus of NN providers , on any given day or hour , results from intelligence agency directives , according to reputable authorities including myriad retired NN officials and intelligence officers . So ask and answer the following intelligent questions : * Why have JJ JJ officials , beginning with Secretary of Defense William Cohen during the NNP NNS , publicized NNP 's greatest vulnerability lies in the realm of biological weapons wielded by terrorists ? Is this not a form of treason against the NNP NNPS to relay such sensitive intelligence to potential enemies through the mainstream press ? During the McCarthy era , Hollywood producers were persecuted for having the slightest liberal or Communist sympathies . What has changed to allow the Hollywood production of "" Black Hawk Down "" to be VBN by Saddam Hussein and his NN and intelligence commanders to educate and inspire his troops ? * Why does the mainstream NN continue to foretell of the expected arrival of the "" NNP NNP "" - an influenza NN that will produce a super - NN that will kill billions of NNS , IN the "" Spanish NN "" did between 1918 - CD , while totally disregarding the individuals , organizations , and laboratories that have labored to produce these weapons of mass destruction ? RB the devastating Spanish NN NN has been , literally , unearthed for further NN and , do you suppose , deployment ? * Why was the "" Spanish NN "" influenza NN called the "" Spanish NN "" when it originated , by historic accounts , in Tibet in 1917 ? It is VBN that Spanish newspapers were the only ones reporting on the great plague due to their neutrality over NNP NNP I politics . However , Spain was as dear to NNP then as Communist China is to the NNP NNPS today . The "" Spanish NN "" was named such following CD decades of disputes between NNP and Spain over colonization of the Caribbean Islands , Hawaii and the Phillippines beginning with the Spanish JJ NN that ended in the Phillippines in 1902 . Does this history appear to be repeating with the advent of NNP , allegedly from China ? * If the legions of recognized authorities herald the coming of the "" NNP NN , "" why do the same persons disregard this author 's publication of U.S. NNP , National Institutes of NNP , and National Cancer Institute documents showing that the U.S. Army 's 6th top biological weapons contractor in 1969 - 1970 prepared mutants of influenza and para - influenza viruses recombined with acute lymphocytic leukemia viruses ? In other words , how MD you VB to have a strain of the NN that spreads cancer by sneezing ? Can you RB rationalize the develop of such a NN - lymphocytic leukemia that kills most victims in just a few weeks following airborne transmission ? These have been shown clearly on page 452 of the national bestselling book , Emerging Viruses : AIDS & Ebola - Nature , Accident or Intentional ? http://www.healthyworlddistributing.com/detail.aspx?ID=4) in circulation since 1996 . A copy of this "" menu "" of infectious agents , potential biological weapons , listing several mutant recombinants involving NN viruses is posted below for your inspection . Why have n't you previously heard about these developments ? Especially since these documents have been extensively circulated throughout newsrooms and NN offices , particularly those engaged in JJ NN , since 1996 ? Finally , how , if I published this information , and definitive documentation , and sent this critical intelligence along with urgent pleas to approximately 8,500 members of the mainstream NN ( as I have done this week and on dozens of previous occasions for the past seven NNS ) can you turn on your television sets and gain nothing but the "" same JJ song ? "" If you have considered and answered the above questions , does n't it VB sense that NNP is being manipulated , if not targeted , for the purpose of advancing a JJ population reduction agenda , if not NNP NNP III ? The "" NNP NNP "" is Coming The U.S. Army 's 6th top biological weapons contractor in 1969 - 1970 prepared mutants of influenza and para - influenza viruses recombined with acute lymphocytic leukemia viruses . In other words , how MD you VB to have a strain of the NN that spreads quick killing cancer by sneezing ? According to most emerging NN experts and NN NN officials the ' NNP CD "" might arrive at any NN . Emma Ross of the Associated Press reported on NNP as the NNP NNP Organization ( WHO ) launched its "" NN plan to attack "" the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome . WHO , as you MD recall , is a U.N. sponsored organization that is rumored to have helped spread AIDS to Africa by NN of contaminated hepatitis B and / or polio vaccinations . There is a reasonable amount of evidence to support this contention . More disconcerting , the U.N. is VBN to be heavily influenced by Rockefeller family members and corporate interests . History shows Rockefeller fortunes built the U.N. building in NNP York City . During WWII , the Rockefeller family and their Standard NNP NNP supported Hitler more than they did the allies according to NN records . CD federal judge ruled Rockefeller committed "" treason "" against the NNP NNPS . Ê Following WWII , according to attorney John Loftus - an official Nazi NN crimes investigator - Nelson Rockefeller persuaded the U.N. 's NNP JJ voting block to favor Israel 's creation only to assure secrecy regarding his support for the Nazis . Earlier that NN , John D. Rockefeller joined Prescott Bush and the British Royal Family in sponsoring the eugenics initiatives that gave rise to Hitler 's racial hygiene programs . During the same period the Rockefeller family virtually monopolized JJ medicine , JJ pharmaceutics and the cancer and genetics industries . Today , the Rockefeller family , foundation , U.N. and WHO remain at the forefront of administering "" population programs "" designed to reduce NN populations to more manageable levels . As IN a recent advertisement Foreign Affairs - a prestigious political periodical published by the David Rockefeller directed Council on Foreign Relations - the U.S. population is being targeted for a 50 % reduction . "" We 've never faced anything on this scale with such a JJ reach , ' "" VBD Dr. David Heymann , of the WHO , regarding NN . "" This is the JJ NN that a JJ network of laboratories are sharing information , samples , NN , pictures , "" added Dr. Klaus Stohr , a WHO virologist coordinating labs internationally . "" Basically overnight , there are no secrets , there is no jealousy , there is no competition in the face of a JJ NN emergency . This is a phenomenal network . In CD week , the Associated Press reported , the WHO 's lab network had "" isolated the NN NN , produced a preliminary diagnostic test , and narrowed the NN ' identity down to CD candidates - neither CD a JJ strain of influenza . In the following week , various antiviral drugs were tested as possible treatments . "" Meanwhile , doctors were RB sharing information . . . . WHO coordinated exchanges of NNS , NN histories and possible treatments . . . . Asian doctors talked about various therapies they were trying ; later , the Europeans and NNP Americans conferred . "" In eastern Asia - at NN invitation - expert field teams of WHO staffers and NNS from international institutes were sent to Vietnam , Hong Kong and China to figure out how the NN was spread , to VB treat patients and advise how to VB it . "" Aileen Plant , an infectious NN epidemiologist from Curtin NNP in NNP , led a dozen experts in Hanoi , CD of the hard - hit areas . Her international NN focused on the Hanoi French Hospital , which closed its doors to JJ patients and quarantined those inside . JJ of the sick were doctors and nurses . . . . "" With newly released figures from China , there have been more than 1,500 NNS and slightly more than 50 deaths worldwide , including three in Canada . The WHO believes the NN is generally under NN , but Hong Kong remains a challenge . In mainland China , the picture is somewhat murky . . . . "" JJ inside the WHO VBP the NNP operation as a kind of dress rehearsal - ' good practice , ' Heymann VBD - for the NNP NNP , the inevitable killer NN NN that experts VBP MD come at any NN . "" ' This is n't the NNP NNP , because I VBP it 's being contained . ' "" What You Should Do The above information has been meticulously documented and referenced in this author 's CD previous works , Emerging Viruses : AIDS & Ebola - Nature , Accident or Intentional ? and Death in the NNP : Globalism , Terrorism and Toxic Warfare . It begs the question of what to do ? There are personal and socio-political directions for a rational response . Here are my recommendations . 1 . Personally , you and your loved ones are encouraged to do everything in your NN to lift your natural immunity to beyond the 3rd percentile that is apparently necessary to prevent your death from NN , or other more pathogenic agents . ÊÊ For instructions in this regard , I recommend learning from various alternative JJ websites , including www.healingcelebrations.com. These are dedicated to helping you improve your NN naturally . There are five practical steps you can take that are detailed therein , and in my Healing Celebrations : Miraculous Recoveries Through Ancient Scripture , Natural Medicine and Modern NNP ( Tetrahedron Publishing Group , 2000 ) . These include : 1 ) detoxification , 2 ) deacidification / alkalinization , 3 ) immunity boosting , 4 ) oxygenation , and 5 ) bioelectric / energetic methods . 2 . Socially , you should alert your family and friends regarding these matters in an effort to prevent their victimization , NN manipulation , and continued confusion . 3 . Politically , you MD wish to become active in an effort to bring greater JJ attention to these appalling realities . "" We the NNPS "" can VB a difference in halting the ongoing genocides being conducted under the guises of "" JJ NN "" and "" JJ NN . "" This was recently demonstrated when our revealing light of NN illuminated the risks and myths surrounding the deadly smallpox NN . Grassroots publications IN Smallpox Alert , published by the Idaho Observer , and the affiliated NN at www.allaboutsmallpox.com, created a massive backlash bringing the entire program to an embarrassing halt . By forwarding this article and related NN , www.SARSscam.com, to as JJ NNS as possible , we can effect the same successful result . About the Author Leonard G. Horowitz , D.M.D. , M.A. , M.P.H. , is an internationally VBN authority in the overlapping fields of JJ NN , behavioral NN , emerging NNS , and bioterrorism . He received his doctorate in JJ dentistry from Tufts NNP School of Dental Medicine in 1977 , was awarded a post - doctoral fellowship in behavioral NN at the NNP of Rochester , earned a Master of NNP NNP degree from Harvard NNP , and another Master of Arts degree in NN education from Beacon College , all before joining the research faculty at Harvard . Dr. Horowitz is best VBN for his national bestselling book , Emerging Viruses : AIDS & Ebola - Nature , Accident or Intentional ? ( Tetrahedron Press , 1998 ; 1-888-508-4787 ; http://www.healthyworlddistributing.com/detail.aspx?ID=4) which recently resulted in the NNP Stated General Accounting Office investigating the man-made origin of AIDS NN . ( VB : http://www.healingcelebrations.com/gao.htm) Dr. Horowitz 's work in the field of NN NN awareness has prompted at least three Third NNP nations to VB their NN policies . His recent stunning testimony before the NNP NNPS Congress ' NNP Reform Committee , literally brought the hearing to a halt . ( VB : http://www.healingcelebrations.com/Disease%20Deities%20on%20Capitol%20Hill%20Address%20Autism.htm) ÊDr . Horowitz questioned NN NN officials regarding a Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention ( CDC ) secreted report showing a definitive link between the mercury ingredient ( i.e. , Thimerosal ) , common to most vaccinations , and the skyrocketing rates of NN and behavioral disorders affecting our NNS and the future our nation . Incredibly , Dr. Horowitz alerted the NNP , in writing and in NN , CD week before the JJ anthrax mailing was announced in the press , that a "" major anthrax fright "" was in the process of unfolding that demanded the NNP 's urgent attention . Needless to VB they did not heed Dr. Horowitz 's prophetic warning . Moreover , three months before the September 11 attacks on the NNP Trade Center and Pentagon , Dr. Horowitz released his thirteenth book , prophetically titled Death in the NNP : Globalism , Terrorism and Toxic Warfare ( http://www.healthyworlddistributing.com/detail.aspx?ID=3),. The book focuses on the West Nile NNP as an act of bioterroism , and considers what and who is RB behind this and other recent outbreaks . Dr. Horowitz argues that his disclosures expose the roots of JJ terrorism , along with the individuals and organizations at the heart of what he calls "" the petrochemical - pharmaceutical cartel . "" He believes this "" multi-national corporate beast "" is in the process of committing JJ genocide , profiting from engineered frights , and at the same NN , most efficiently culling targeted populations considered excessive . As you MD have heard , Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , called for an investigation into the links between the recent West Nile NN outbreaks and bioterrrorism .

NNS analyzed NNS on 196,929 NNS born from 2000 through 2010 in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California healthcare NN after at least 24 weeks gestation . During follow - up periods ranging from CD to 15 NNS , 1.6 percent of the NNS were diagnosed with ASD . Among the mothers of that 1.6 percent , fewer than 1 percent had the NN while pregnant , and about 23 percent had gotten a NN NN . Neither influenza infection nor NN during pregnancy were tied to NNS being diagnosed with ASD , the research NN reports in JAMA Pediatrics . “ Our NNS showed pretty convincingly that there was no association with influenza at any NN during pregnancy and NN in the child , ” VBD senior author Lisa Croen , of Kaiser Permanente Northern California in Oakland . “ We ’re not recommending that any changes be made to the NN policy , ” Croen told Reuters NNP . “ We are encouraging NNS to VB vaccinated while pregnant . ” Previous studies looking at possible links between influenza during pregnancy and ASD had produced mixed results , Croen and her colleagues note in JAMA Pediatrics . And until now , they add , no studies had looked for links between ASD and NN NNS , which are recommended for pregnant NNS . NNS with ASD MD have JJ , communication and behavioral challenges that MD VB them to interact , learn and behave in ways different from most NNS , according to the U.S. Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention ( CDC ) . A second NN published in the same journal RB VBD no link between NNS against influenza A ( H1N1 ) - sometimes referred to as swine flue - during pregnancy in 2009 - 2010 and complications later in NN for over 60,000 Danish NNS . The results support the overall safety profile of the NN , write the NNS , who were led by Anders Hviid , of the Statens Serum Institute in Copenhagen . They support the NNP NNP Organization ’s recommendations that pregnant NNS should VB a NN NN . While the CDC recommends that everyone over 6 months of age receive a NN NN , it ’s especially important for some NNS - including pregnant NNS - who are more likely to experience complications from the NN . “ The NN in pregnancy is dangerous , ” VBD Dr. Loralei Thornburg , a high - NN pregnancy expert at the NNP of Rochester NNP Center in NNP York . “ We VBP that NNS who have the NN do much worse and we VBP their babies do worse . ” Pregnant NNS with influenza MD be at an increased NN for premature labor and delivery , according to the CDC . There is RB a greater NN of birth defects in their babies . “ There have been a lot of fears about NNS , but the NNS suggest they are effective and do n’t increase the NN of NN and other perinatal complications , ” VBD Thornburg , who was not involved with the JJ studies . “ The benefits strongly outweigh any risks or theoretical risks that we ’ve seen . ”"

Copyright_NN 2020_CD –_: permission_NN to_TO reprint_VB fully_RB granted_VBN ,_, WITH_IN links_NNS to_IN original_JJ story_NN","NN sources out of NNP Zealand are reporting that CD nurses in Samoa , facing charges over the deaths of CD babies who died shortly after receiving the NNS , mumps , and rubella ( MMR ) NN , have pleaded guilty to manslaughter . CD nurses in Samoa , facing charges over the deaths of CD babies , have pleaded guilty to manslaughter . They had previously denied charges of negligence , manslaughter , and obstruction of justice . The pair appeared today in the Supreme NNP for the start of an expected CD week NN , but their lawyer entered guilty pleas . CD defendant , Luse Emo Tauvale , has admitted to three charges of obstruction of justice and CD of negligence and manslaughter , while Leutogi Te’o has pleaded guilty to CD charge of manslaughter . NNP Impact NNP reported on the original story in 2018 when it made headline NN on TV1 in Samoa . Tala Fou brings you breaking NN on the death of CD JJ NNS both aged 1 - NN - JJ from the villages of Safotu and Sasina in Savaii . Both NNS died within minutes of being vaccinated with the MMR vacine at Safotu Hospital on Friday morning the 6th of July . Our NN Reporter Alisa Faamaoni met with both families in Savaii today . The NNS of the JJ child Marietta and Samuelu Tuisuesue of Sasina explained in detail to Tala Fou that within three minutes of their 1 - NN - JJ daughter Lannacallystah Samuelu being injected with the MMR vacine by a nurse she was dead . • CDC , check YOUR NNS , MMR rates are NOT declining What was so tragic about this story was that the NNS of the second child who died had reportedly already learned about the JJ infant ’s death a couple hours earlier and declined to have their child receive the same NN . The mother reported that the nurse administered the MMR NN against her consent , leading to the child ’s immediate death upon receiving the NN . The second family from Safotu is still coming to grips with the loss of their 1 - NN - JJ son Lameko Siu . The NNS Punipuao and Si’u Timua arrived at the Safotu hospital with their son Lameko on Friday within CD hours of the death of the JJ child once they became aware of what had happend the mother refused to allow her son to be vaccinated . The mother claims that the nurse on duty persisted and without her consent vaccinated her son administering the MMR NN and within a minute he was dead . After the second death , NN authorities immediately confiscated all the remaining doses of the MMR NN , and dismissed the JJ staff , not only to apparently conduct an investigation , but for their own safety from an outraged NN . The Prime Minister of Samoa , Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi , issued a statement about the tragic events and reported that , as a grandfather , CD of his grandsons had previously suffered something similar , an apparent NN injury that he survived but now can no longer talk . Death leaves a heartache no NN can heal . And I can imagine that there is no NN more far reaching and deeper than losing a child . My heart and prayers VBP out to the grieving families at this most difficult NN . To that effect , I humbly extend my deepest sympathy , condolences and pray that comfort and peace will come to them . As a grandfather and father , I can relate to the grief by the families for their loss . I RB almost lost CD of my grandsons several NNS RB under similar circumstances . But with the Grace of our Father in Heaven my grandson survived with the proper NN but he will never be the same as he has lost the ability to speak . As Prime Minister , I have called a full inquiry into the circumstances leading up to this devastating incident which I do not take lightly . There are already processes that will determine if negligence is a factor . And if so , rest assured those processes will be implemented to the letter to ensure that such a tragedy will not be repeated and those responsible will be made to answer . A Prime Example Why Informed Consent and Parental Rights are Important , and How Forced Vaccinations Endanger the Lives of NNS NNS carry serious risks , and RB the U.S. Supreme NNP has acknowledged these risks by stating that NNS are “ Unavoidably unsafe . ” All across the U.S. pro-vaccine extremists are trying to eliminate NN exemptions and parental choice for NNS . A recent bill passed in Oregon RB gave dentists the NN to vaccinate NNS , as the NN extremists push the agenda of NNP Pharma to try and vaccinate the entire NN , regardless of whether or not some NNS are more susceptible to NN injuries than others . And in California Senator Richard Pan wants California to be the JJ NN in the U.S. to eliminate RB the JJ exemption for NNS , where physicians can best determine whether their patients should receive every NN recommended by the CDC in the childhood NN schedule . Pan wants the politicians , the NN Department of NNP NNP , to approve any JJ exemption to NNS instead of JJ doctors who provide JJ services to California NNS , and their NNS . Of course when NNS die or are injured by NNS in the NNP NNPS , there is no NN attention and JJ outcry IN there was in Samoa . That ’s because the U.S. is the only NN in the NN that has given the pharmaceutical industry immunity from legal consequences due to harm caused by NNS .

The stakes MD n't be higher , as JJ NN officials and NN leaders VBP an effective NN or NN against the NN that causes the NN NNP - CD is necessary to fully restart economies and resume civic NN . As the pace accelerates , USA TODAY is rounding up some of the week 's most notable NN developments . Here 's what we VBP about the JJ U.S. candidate being tested on hundreds of volunteers , the eight potential NNS being tracked by the NNP NNP Organization , and the $ 8 CD that 's funding laboratories . JJ US NN candidate cleared by FDA for Phase 2 of testing The JJ U.S. NNP - NNP - 2 NN NN has been cleared to VB into Phase 2 testing by the Food and NNP Administration , Massachusetts - VBN Moderna announced Thursday . The NN candidate ( a potential NN that MD be VBN if VBN safe and effective ) is called mRNA - 1273 and was RB given to volunteers in Seattle on March 16 as Phase 1 testing began . FDA has completed its review of Moderna 's Investigational NNP NNP application for mRNA - 1273 , which allows it to now proceed to Phase 2 NN . Moderna expects such tests to begin “ shortly , ” it VBD in a NN release . Phase 2 testing is done with several hundred volunteers and looks to VB how their immune systems respond to the NN and whether it makes them immune to the NN . Safety and side effects are RB studied . Moderna VBD it is finalizing the protocol for Phase 3 NN of mRNA - 1273 . Those tests are expected to begin in early summer . Phase 3 NNS involve giving a NN to JJ numbers of NNS to VB whether it works , whether it is safe and whether it has unknown or rare side effects . These can range from the thousands to the tens of thousands of volunteers . Consider this : To find a NN NN , can we ethically infect NNS with a NN with no cure ? WHO is tracking 8 NNS in JJ evaluation As of Wednesday , the NNP NNP Organization was tracking eight potential NNS for NN - CD ( called candidate NNS ) in JJ evaluation . These included four from China , CD from England , CD from the NNP NNPS and CD from the NNP Union . The list RB includes 100 candidate NNS in preclinical evaluation , meaning they are still being tested in test tubes or in NNS . The previous version of the list , published on April 20 , included 5 candidate NNS in JJ evaluation and 71 in preclinical evaluation . NNP York - VBN pharmaceutical NN Pfizer on Monday began testing a NN candidate for NNP - NNP - 2 , the NN that causes NN - CD . In its announcement , the NN VBD it went from pre-clinical studies in test tubes and NNS to injecting NNS with a possible NN in less than four months . The NNS , which are taking place in the NNP NNPS , are still Phase 1 . These test whether a potential NN is safe , has side effects and produces the desired response from the NN ’s immune NN . NNS must VB through Phase 1 , 2 and 3 testing before they can be licensed . Each phase involves larger numbers of volunteers . Pfizer is working with German pharmaceutical NN BioNTech on the candidate NN , dubbed BNT162 . The NN RB tested it in Germany last month on 12 healthy adults . The NNS VBP they plan to test the candidate NN on 360 healthy volunteers in the NNP NNPS BNT162 is a messenger RNA NN that instructs NNS to VB a specific piece of NN to VB what ’s on NNP - NN - 2 ’s spike NN . The hope is the NN pieces will VB the NN to create antibodies that will stop the NN from being able to attach to and invade NNS . NNS at Oxford NNP ’s Jenner Institute plan to test a candidate NN on more than 6,000 NNS by the end of NNP . If it is effective and safe , they MD have millions of doses ready in the fall . The work is being done at the NN ’s Jenner Institute , named for Edward Jenner , the 18th - NN British physician who pioneered the smallpox NN . Tests done in six rhesus macaque monkeys seemed to show the candidate NN was protective . Now Phase 1 JJ tests are beginning . The NN is partnering with the British pharmaceutical NN AstraZeneca to move forward with NN should the candidate NN prove effective . Both have agreed to operate on a not - for - profit basis for the duration of the NN NN , with only the costs of production and distribution being covered . Oxford NNP and its spin - out NN Vaccitech , which jointly hold the rights to the technology VBN to develop the candidate NN , will receive no royalties during the NN , the NN VBD . In a NN meeting on Monday hosted by the NNP Union , NN leaders , nonprofits and celebrities pledged $ 8 CD to fund laboratories working to develop and produce a NN . The NN was for the Access to NN - CD Tools Accelerator , or the ACT Accelerator , a collaboration between the NNP NNP organization and governments , nonprofits and industry worldwide . It was launched April 24 . They all pledged to work with and support the effort . The collaboration ’s mission statement VBD in part , “ We VBP that as RB as anyone is at NN from this NN , the entire NN is at NN – every single NN on the NN needs to be protected from this NN . ’ The NNP NNPS was among the few NNS not taking part in the fund - raising effort . The three - hour event fundraising effort on Monday was something IN an JJ - fashioned telethon , with a leader from each NN taking a few minutes on the NN call to pledge NN for the ACTS Accelerator . To submit a NN for the weekly roundup , or share other NN NN , please email Elizabeth Weise at eweise@usatoday.com"

The heartbreaking situation reminded me what my friend and mentor , Dr. Bruce Innis , told me as I embarked on a career in NN NN , “ NNS do n’t save lives , NN saves lives . ” He should VB , Dr. Innis has helped successfully develop more than 15 NNS , including the JEV NN licensed in the U.S . Developing NNS is a complex process driven by the fundamentals of biology , biomanufacturing and engineering , and innovation . NN concepts are explored , and prototypes RB tested in the lab . NNS then test the safety of the NN on NNS and , if results are promising , JJ NNS involving NNS begin . It can take NNS to develop a NN , and something that works well in the lab MD not fare as well in NNS . We need to keep this JJ , complicated , uncertain process in mind as we hear NN emerge about NN candidates for the NNP - CD NN . The U.S. Food and NNP Administration reviews and decides whether a NN candidate is suitable for experimentation in NNS . Although the agency does consider the results of NN studies , much of its review focuses on how the NN is manufactured , and whether the process is scalable . NN at scale ( hundreds of millions of doses ) is important because it is not enough to demonstrate a NN is safe and has JJ benefit , you need a NN in place to VB sure the NN is accessible , and NNS are actually vaccinated . The entire process can take up to ten NNS , sometimes longer , and can cost up to a CD U.S. dollars , sometimes more . RB in times of a JJ NN emergency it is difficult to advance a NN from concept to the marketplace . I played key roles in developing candidate NNS for Ebola , MERS - NNP , and Zika , and despite the JJ suffering caused by these NNS , despite their international focus , and despite considerable investment from governments and the pharmaceutical industry , only CD of those NNS ( Ebola ) has been licensed . The NNP NNP Organization ( WHO ) attempts to expedite JJ NN NN efforts by facilitating coordination and communication , using tools IN their ‘ NN pipeline tracker . ’ In an unfortunate but recurring pattern , numerous NN candidates always populate the tracker initially as outbreaks unfold and the NN flows but , invariably , developers move on and drop off as resources and interest dries up . It is unclear how the WHO ’s role and influence will VB if the U.S. severs ties and withdraws its NNS and funding from Geneva . JJ developers with promising NN candidates become permanently stalled in their NN process because they cannot afford the costs of required testing . Others experience significant bottlenecks when trying to access the limited biomanufacturing facilities specialized in producing NNS suitable for JJ NN . RB JJ pharmaceutical NNS with generous JJ coffers and in - NN capabilities face sizeable opportunity costs by pursuing epidemic outbreak projects . They are forced to borrow staff and other resources from current projects to support JJ NN teams , thereby stalling ongoing projects and the introduction of NNS against other JJ NNS . Facing such programmatic headwinds , how is the U.S. NN VBG to execute its NNP - CD NN NN plan , Operation Warp Speed ? Compared to the U.S. NN responses for Ebola , MERS , and Zika , JJ elements of the operation are status quo , especially in the areas of NN and NN . The NNP - CD NN effort , however , looks to employ JJ approaches in the hopes of reducing project timelines . For example , utilizing the Department of Defense to deploy , distribute , and administer NNS MD support the rapid immunization of sizable populations . Another JJ approach is the expanded role of the federal NN in the private - JJ partnerships that have defined the NNP - CD NN NN NN . Operation Warp Speed directs that the federal NN will decide on the NN NN pathways and the pharmaceutical NNS will not , “ … decide on their own protocols . ” The successful past performance of private - JJ partnerships in NN NN leave me very encouraged for the prospect of a safe and effective NN - CD NN . My expectations are measured and cautious , however , given the difficult realities of JJ - private coordination , NN sharing , and industry finding the balance between meeting JJ NN needs and revenue goals . As with any ambitious and audacious plan , the devil is in the highly complex details . There is no doubt the federal NN has numerous very experienced NN developers , and it was my privilege to work with JJ of them during my Army career and I continue to do so today . But NN NN involves numerous teams working together and requires close coordination , not only between NN agencies ( this is hard enough ) , but with Congress and the academic and private sectors . Achieving harmony in these relationships has been difficult in the past because the mission scope and incentives for the NN and the private sector are different in JJ important ways . John NNP , Pfizer ’s chief business officer , was recently quoted saying Pfizer MD not seeking NN funding ( RB after they were selected by U.S. NN as a finalist for funding ) because their focus was speed and they , “ … did n't VB to … spend a month negotiating with the U.S. NN . ” The NN is focused on protecting the Nation and its citizens . The pharmaceutical industry cares greatly about JJ NN , but RB answers to shareholders . Committing millions of dollars to high - NN ventures is a daily occurrence in the NN NN industries but that NN is carefully calculated , as is the JJ upside . In some NNS , such as with Merck ’s Ebola and GSK ’s malaria NNS , NNS embark on NN projects despite understanding there will be JJ losses , but these situations are the exception . How will industry manage the risks and costs of developing a NNP - CD NN , while relinquishing considerable developmental command and NN to the NN ? Why does it matter who controls the NN plan ? Because they determine how the NN will ultimately be VBN and by whom , thereby defining the NN . If protocol designs are restricted to meet U.S. or largely Western agendas , industry MD lose out on accessing a JJ NNP - CD NN NN , perhaps the biggest NN NN , - which means billions MD be left without a NN and industry MD be left without a good NN to recoup its investment . There is RB the issue of who will own the intellectual property ( IP ) generated during the collaboration . IP protections are major drivers of revenue streams and recovery of research and NN investments . Members of Congress are already waging NN on NN and other pharmaceutical pricing and profits . More than a few members wish to RB revamp provisions in U.S. Code , IN the Bayh - Dole Act , to limit industry ’s exclusive rights to IP developed using U.S. taxpayer dollars . The NN MD contend , some VBP rightly , that if U.S. taxpayers are paying the NN bill , the U.S. must be guaranteed an immediate return on its investment - such as preferential NN access and / or pricing . But this concept of “ NNP RB , ” is not playing well . Paul Hudson , the CEO of French NN juggernaut Sanofi Pasteur , was quickly corrected by the French NN when he implied the U.S. MD be entitled to preferential NNP - CD NN access due to its JJ investment . Heads of prominent non-governmental organizations , governments , and industry convened this spring to discuss the topic of NN access and the result , expressed by Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , WHO Director - General , was that , “ NNS , NN partners , manufacturers , and the private sector must act together and ensure that the fruits of NN and research can benefit everybody . ” Once a NN is available , NN and distribution activities will need to be sustained and licenses and certifications maintained RB after the U.S. NN has moved on to the next problem . These activities represent millions of dollars in expenditures every NN . The pharmaceutical industry executes these tasks on a routine basis but without the JJ upside of JJ NN access and IP rights , how will they be incentivized ? JJ NNS jump into the NN NN pool during epidemics and pandemics because it is the JJ thing to do for JJ NN . But few possess , or tolerate , the required JJ staying NN to VB the project to completion . My experience leaves me little doubt that developing a safe and effective NN - CD NN is feasible . The unprecedented scope of coordination between , and among , U.S. NN agencies and industry is reassuring that the process can move fast , maybe RB approach very fast , but that ’s slightly slower than warp speed . Last week it was reported that the NN identified five NNS it believes have the highest likelihood of delivering a safe and effective NN - CD NN , including Moderna , AstraZeneca , Johnson & Johnson , Merck , and Pfizer . But numerous questions remain about how the relationship between the NN partners will continue to be mutually beneficial RB enough to not only realize the NN of a NN but to witness lives saved through NN .

The lab NNS , contained in more than 9,000 pages of files that emerged a NN after the Justice Department closed its inquiry and condemned the late Army microbiologist Bruce Ivins as the perpetrator , shows unusual levels of silicon and tin in anthrax powder from CD of the five letters . Those elements are VBN in compounds that MD be VBN to weaponize the anthrax , enabling the lethal spores to float easily so they MD be readily inhaled by the intended victims , NNS VBP . The existence of the silicon - tin chemical signature offered investigators the possibility of tracing purchases of the more than 100 such chemical NNS available before the attacks , which might have produced hard evidence against Ivins or led the agency to the real culprit . More at The Real NN But the NNP lab reports released in late February give no hint that bureau agents tried to find the buyers of additives such as tin-catalyzed silicone polymers . The apparent failure of the NNP to pursue this avenue of investigation raises the ominous possibility that the killer is still on the loose . A McClatchy analysis of the records RB shows that other key scientific questions were left unresolved and conflicting NNS was n’t sorted out when the NNP declared Ivins the killer shortly after his July 29 , 2008 , suicide . CD chemist at a national laboratory told McClatchy that the tin-silicone findings and the contradictory NNS should prompt a JJ round of testing on the anthrax powder . A senior federal law enforcement official , who was made available only on the condition of anonymity , VBD the NNP had ordered exhaustive tests on the possible sources of silicon in the anthrax and concluded that it was n’t added . Instead , the lab VBD that it ’s common for anthrax spores to incorporate JJ silicon and oxygen into their coatings as a “ natural phenomenon ” that does n’t affect the spores ’ behavior , the official VBD . To arrive at that position , however , the NNP had to discount its own bulk testing results showing that silicon composed an extraordinary 10.8 percent of a sample from a mailing to the NNP York Post and as much as 1.8 percent of the anthrax from a letter sent to Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont , far more than the occasional trace contamination . Tin — not RB seen in anthrax powder at all — was measured at 0.65 percent and 0.2 percent , respectively , in those letters . An NNP spokesman declined to comment on the presence of tin or to answer other questions about the silicon - tin connection . Several NNS and JJ colleagues of Ivins argue that he was a career biologist who probably lacked the chemistry knowledge and skills to concoct a silicon - VBN additive . “ There ’s no NN that an individual scientist can invent a JJ NN of making anthrax using silicon and tin , ” VBD Stuart Jacobsen , a Texas - VBN analytical chemist for an electronics NN who ’s closely studied the NNP lab results . “ It requires an institutional effort to do this , such as at a JJ lab . ” Martin Hugh - Jones , a NN - renowned anthrax expert who teaches veterinary medicine at Louisiana NNP NNP , called it “ just bizarre ” that the labs VBD both tin — which can be toxic to bacteria such as anthrax during lab culturing — and silicon . “ You have CD elements at abnormally high levels , ” Hugh - Jones VBD . “ That reduces your probability to a very small number that it ’s an accident . ” The silicon - tin connection was n’t the only lead left open in CD of the biggest investigations in NNP history , an inquiry that took the bureau to the cutting edge of laboratory NN . In April , McClatchy reported that after locking in on Ivins in 2007 , the bureau stopped searching for a NN to a unique genetic bacterial strain NNS had VBN in the anthrax that was mailed to the Post and to NBC NNP anchor Tom Brokaw , although a senior bureau official had characterized it as the hottest clue to date . NNP officials VBP it ’s all a moot point , because they ’re positive they got the JJ NN in Ivins . A mentally troubled anthrax researcher at the U.S. Army NNP Research Institute of Infectious NNPS at Fort Detrick , Md. , Ivins overdosed on drugs not RB after learning that he ’d soon face five counts of capital murder . In ending the inquiry last NN , the Justice Department VBD that a genetic fingerprint had pointed investigators to Ivins ’ lab , and gumshoe investigative techniques enabled them to compile considerable circumstantial evidence that demonstrated his guilt . Among these proofs , prosecutors cited Ivins ’ alleged attempt to steer investigators away from a flask of anthrax in his lab that genetically matched the mailed powder — anthrax that had been shared with other NNS . They RB noted his anger over a looming congressional cut in funds for his research on a JJ anthrax NN . However , the NNP never VBD hard evidence that Ivins produced the anthrax or that he scrawled threatening letters seemingly meant to resemble those of Islamic terrorists . Or that he secretly took late - night drives to Princeton , N.J. , to mail them . The NNP declared Ivins the killer soon after paying $ 5.8 CD to settle a suit filed by another JJ USAMRIID researcher , Steven Hatfill , whom the agency mistakenly had targeted earlier in its investigation . Anthrax is CD of the deadliest and most feared biological weapons . Once inhaled , microscopic anthrax spores germinate into rapidly multiplying , highly toxic bacteria that attack JJ tissue . The resulting illnesses are lethal within days if untreated . The letters , mailed just weeks after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , not only went to the NNP York Post , Leahy and Brokaw , but RB to NNP NNP Inc. in Boca Raton , Fla. , and to Democratic then - Sen . Tom Daschle of NNP Dakota . Five NNS died , 17 were sickened and about 31,000 were forced to take powerful antibiotics for weeks . Crews wearing NN suits spent several weeks eradicating the spores from a Senate office building and a central Postal Service facility in Washington . The NNP guarded its laboratory ’s finding of 10.8 percent silicon in the Post letter for NNS . NNP York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler asked NNP Director Robert Mueller how much silicon was in the Post and Leahy letters at a hearing before the NNP Judiciary Committee in September 2008 . The Justice Department responded seven months later that silicon made up 1.4 percent of the Leahy powder ( without disclosing the 1.8 percent reading ) and that “ a reliable quantitative measurement was not possible ” for the Post letter . The bureau ’s conclusions that silicon was absorbed naturally drew a gentle challenge in February from a panel of the National Academy of Sciences , which evaluated the investigation ’s lab work . While finding no evidence that silicon had been added to the mailed anthrax , the panel noted deep in its report that the NNP had provided “ no compelling explanation ” for conflicts in silicon test results between the Sandia National Laboratories and its own lab . Sandia — which VBD electron microscopes , unlike the NNP — reported only a tenth as much silicon in the NNP York Post letter as the bureau ’s lab did . Sandia VBD it was all embedded in the spore coatings , where it was n’t harmful . The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology ran a third set of tests and VBD pockets of heavy silica concentrations , but it MD n’t VB whether they were inside or outside the spores . Jacobsen , the Texas chemist , suspects that the silica pockets represented excess material that went through a chemical reaction and hardened before it MD penetrate the spores . The National Academy of Sciences panel wrote that the varying composition of the powder might have accounted for the differing findings . While finding no evidence that silicon was added , the panel VBD it “ cannot rule out the intentional addition of a silicon - VBN substance … in a failed attempt to enhance dispersion ” of the NNP York Post powder . Tufts NNP chemistry professor David Walt , who led the panel ’s analysis of the silicon issue , VBD in a phone interview that “ there was not enough silicon in the spores that MD account for the total silicon content of the bulk analysis . ” He VBD it was unclear whether the “ trace ” levels of tin were significant . During the NNP ’s seven - NN hunt , the Department of Homeland Security commissioned a NN of chemists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California to grow anthrax - IN spores under varying conditions to VB how much silicon MD end up naturally in the final product . They VBD little , if any , silicon in most NNS , far less than was in the NNP York Post letter , VBD Stephan Velsko , CD of the CD NNS . He called the tin readings from the NNP ’s anthrax NNS “ baffling . ” Peter Weber , Velsko ’s co-researcher , VBD the academy panel ’s focus on the conflicting NNS “ raises a JJ question , ” and “ it ’d be RB helpful for closure of this NN if that was resolved . ” He suggested that further “ micro-analysis ” with a highly sophisticated electron microscope MD “ pop the question marks RB quickly . ” In a chapter in a recently updated book , “ Microbial Forensics , ” Velsko wrote that the anthrax “ must have indeed been produced under an unusual set of conditions ” to create such high silicon counts . That scenario , he cautioned , might not be “ consistent with the prosecution narrative in this NN . ” About 100 tin-catalyzed silicone NNS are on the NN , and an RB wider array was available in 2000 and 2001 , before the mailings , VBD Richie Ashburn , a vice NN of CD manufacturer , Silicones Inc. , in High Point , N.C . Mike Wilson , a chemist for another silicone NNS maker , SiVance , in Gainesville , Fla. , VBD that numerous silicon NNS MD be VBN to VB spores or other particles NN - repellent . He RB VBD that the ratios of silicon to tin VBN in the Post and Leahy samples MD be “ about JJ ” if a tin- catalyzed silicone had been added to the spores . Jacobsen , a Scottish - born and - educated chemist who once experimented with silicon coatings on dust particles , VBD he got interested in the spore chemistry after hearing rumors in late 2001 that a U.S. JJ facility had made the killer potions . He called it “ outrageous ” that the scientific issues have n’t been addressed . “ NNP , the most advanced NN in the NN , and the NNP have every resource available to them , ” he VBD . “ And yet they have no compelling explanation for not properly analyzing the biggest forensic clue in the most important investigation the NNP labs had ever gotten in their history . ” As a result of Ivins ’ death and the unanswered scientific issues , Congress ’ investigative arm , the NNP Accountability Office , is investigating the NNP ’s handling of the anthrax inquiry ."

Thankfully , Oprah is better now . And thankfully , she received excellent care , including close monitoring , antibiotics , and likely inhalers as well . In her chat with Ellen , she voices the importance of getting NN shots and pneumonia shots . For those of us in healthcare , this is not radically JJ information . We are just entering this NN 's NN NN , already having seen at least CD child die from the NN . The NN shot is recommended to all NNS ages 6 months and older . Every NN . Period . But what about the pneumonia shot ? That NN does n't RB VB it to the headlines . Until Oprah had pneumonia , that is . The pneumonia NN is not actually a NN that prevents pneumonia IN se , as pneumonia can be caused by a multitude of viruses and bacteria . But it does prevent infection from 13 to 23 types of the bacteria pneumococcus , a powerful organism that can knock anybody for a loop . The PCV13 ( pneumococcal conjugate NN 13 ) is recommended to infants and NNS , and adults ages 65 NNS and older ; the PCV23 ( pneumococcal conjugate NN 23 ) is recommended to NNS ages CD NNS and older , and adults ages 65 and over who are at NN for pneumonia , or have a chronic illness . Oprah just turned 65 this past January . While she has n't proclaimed whether or not she 's had the PCV13 , the PCV23 , or neither , nor whether or not she 's had the NN shot , she does have a history of supporting other celebrities most VBN to physicians as vocal anti-vaxxers .

Ms. McCarthy has been CD of the loudest celebrity voices of the antivaxx movement , which only continues to thrive today . Because of the inaccuracies and downright falsehoods in linking MMR NNS to NN , the critical number of NNS receiving this NN in the NNP NNPS has dropped to such a low number that there continue to be NNS outbreaks nearly weekly . In August 2019 , the NNP Kingdom lost its "" NNS free "" status according to the WHO , and the U.S. is not far behind .

I VBP the feeling of thinking others were just plain crazy and wrong for not vaccinating their NNS and themselves . ‘ Irresponsible ! ’ I VBD when pointing my finger . I ’d VB the same JJ arguments about polio and small pox and how NNS saved us from all those horrible NNS and just swallowing and regurgitating the propaganda I was brought up with . It was only recently , in 2009 that I started questioning my JJ held beliefs and began digging in to the history , efficacy and safety of NNS . I was appalled at what I VBD and the recklessness of those NN NN agencies entrusted with our NN and our NNS ’s safety , and angry with myself that I had put my family ’s NN at NN by blind faith in others when I was ultimately responsible for the JJ decisions of my family . When I began to put this article together I specifically chose not to include research from or links to websites that are considered untrustworthy by most pro-vaxxers , sites such as Natural NNP , Mercola , etc. RB though I personally trust those sites and much more than I MD WebMd and for good reason [ a ] . Instead I chose to employ basic logic and RB incorporate independent and .gov scientific studies - mostly peer review , journals , NN from mainstream sources ( that pro-vaxxers love and totally trust ) and articles that link to other .gov scientific studies , as well as NN statistical resources . So , I started writing down questions and then looking for answers . I ’ll admit , some of these questions have already been asked by others , but I just expanded upon it to form a helpful list . I hope the following information helps you in your lifelong journey in search of NN , vitality and NN in your own lives and your NNS ’s lives . 1 . Why are newborn babies vaccinated on their JJ day of NN against a NN that is primarily transmitted sexually and by needles in NN NNS ? ( Pregnant NNS are already tested for STD ’s prior to birth so there ’s no reason to give it to an infant ) . Interesting to note , of the few NNS that still are given to infants and STILL has thimerasol in it is Hep B and DipTet ( and NN shot recommended to pregnant NNS ) . So , the claim that it has been removed from all NNS is a lie and misdirection . If they give it to all newborns then ALL the newborns are getting that thimerasol ( mercury derivative ) . “ It was removed from JJ child NNS in 2002 but remains in some NNS ( e.g. , hepatitis B NN and ) ” Page 21 . 2 . Why are babies given NNS to produce antibodies when they do not produce antibodies until after the age of 3 to 6 months ? They VBP the required antibodies from breastfeeding . 3 . Why does the NN tell NNS to delay breast feeding and VB more NNS when breast feeding babies produce higher levels of antibodies ? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov… http://naturalsociety.com… 4 . Why are n’t NN manufacturers held responsible when their product injures your child ? Why MD these NNS need to be protected from the effects of such wonderful NNS ? ( Look into NN Injury Compensation Program .gov and VAERS ) The Supreme NNP ruling exempting the NN manufacturers from all liability is done under the explicit understanding that they fall under the category “ unavoidably unsafe NNS . ” http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-152.pdf http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/index.html https://vaers.hhs.gov/index 5 . Why have no double blind , placebo , randomized controlled NNS been done on any NNS ? This is standard with any other NN . 6 . Why are we following the US NN schedule ? We are the most vaccinated population on the NN with the highest rates of infant deaths / SIDS in the western NN ? http://www.washingtonpost.com… http://sm.stanford.edu/archive/stanmed/2013fall/article2.html 7 . Why are NN outbreaks occurring in populations with 90 % + NN rates ? What about that ‘ Herd Immunity ’ guys ? http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/139/1/77.short http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8483623 http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/6/5/00-0512_article_ADD 8 . Why are NNS vaccinated against these NNS still catching and spreading them ? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24076325 http://www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com…(see Johns Hopkins paper ) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15954490 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8483623 9 . Why are we frightened of non-fatal illnesses that train a child ’s immune NN how to behave ? 10 . Why are NN manufacturers allowed to reduce antigens and insert cheap and toxic additives that aggravate the injection NN ? 11 . Why do we need multi- dose NNS if the number CD priority of NN manufacturers is your child ’s safety ? 12 . Why will no physician sign a written guarantee for a child ’s safety prior to vaccinating them with NNS they insist you take and that they VBP are completely safe ? 13 . Why is there no outrage about the 3.1 CD dollars paid out in NN injury / death claims and yet they claim there is no correlation and they are perfectly safe ? http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statisticsreport.pdf 14 . Why do n’t NNS recognize from history that the most widespread and lethal NNS in the last 200 NNS were reduced due to cleaner drinking NN , improved sanitation , nutrition , less overcrowded areas and better living conditions ? NNS were introduced at points in NN where every single NN was already declining , most almost completely gone . To give NNS credit for JJ reductions in NN is IN giving a band - aid credit for healing a wound that was already closing . Dr. Hans Rosling shows exactly how the NN condition of nearly all NNS of the NN have improved with wealth , RB 200 NNS RB , at the times where there no NNS . http://youtu.be/jbkSRLYSojo https://childhealthsafety.wordpress.com/graphs/ ( blog yes , but the links are amazing and historical NNS . ) http://www.columbia.edu… By the late 1950s , RB before the introduction of NNS NN , NNS - related deaths and NN fatality rates in the NNP NNPS had decreased markedly , presumably as a result of improvement in NN care and nutrition ( Oxford Journal of Infectious NNPS ) . 15 . Why do NNS keep parroting what they hear about ‘ Herd Immunity ? ’ Herd immunity is a hilarious concept that assumes that 1 ) Vaccinated NNS are immune to the NNS for which they ’ve been vaccinated , 2 ) Can not carry the NNS for which they are vaccinated / immune , 3 ) Because most of the NNS are vaccinated , other NNS IN them ca n’t catch the NN . My favourite analogy for herd immunity is that if 95 % of NNS in a building are wearing hard hats when the ceiling falls in , the 5 % are protected . ( credit Dr. Robert Murdoch ) 16 . Why are almost all pro-vaxxer adults we talk to not up to date on their adult vaccinations / boosters ? 18 . Why did n’t our NN NN agencies ever safety test thimerasol ( a mercury derivative and adjuvant ) since Lilly developed it in the 1920’s ? They VBD it in NNS from 1930 to 2004 ! It still is in some NNS such as the NN NN and others . Here is a 2 minute clip , from Congressional Hearings . The EPA themselves acknowledge the toxic effects of mercury : http://www.epa.gov/hg/effects.htm http://www.nytimes.com… http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21350943 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20803069 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21549155 CD . Why is it that only 40 % of NN professionals receive the NN shot each NN ? They must not VB in it . http://abcnews.go.com… 20 . Why ? Instead of a mandatory NN law , why do n’t they have a mandatory law passed to protect us from Iatrogenic Death ? ( Death by NNP , 3rd leading NN of death ! ) http://articles.mercola.com… http://www.worldlawdirect.com… 21 . Why does n’t the pro NN NN admit that the vaccinated spread NN and stop blaming us ? http://www.cnbc.com/id/102473744 http://www.nc.cdc.gov/eid/article/6/5/00-0512_article_ADD 22 . Why do NNS still trust their NN NN agencies when they VBP NNS are perfectly safe ? With all the JJ pharma fraud NNS , Merck , Glaxo Smith Kline , etc. and all the class action suits that come out several times a NN for death / injury you VBP on tv commercials every week , combine that with the VICP and VAERS .gov statistics , and Iatrogenic Death statistics , why do NNS still trust their NN NN agencies when they VBP NNS are perfectly safe ? Having VBN that , why is NN trusted at all since Democide statistics ( death by NN ) show that nearly 300 CD in this last NN were killed by the NN . Those are non-combatants . Here are a few more studies : – Abnormal NNS - mumps - rubella antibodies and CNS autoimmunity in NNS with NN . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12145534 – Serological association of NNS NN and JJ herpes NN - 6 with brain auto - antibodies in NN . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9756729 This NN is the JJ to report an association between NN serology and brain auto antibody in NN ; it supports the hypothesis that a NN - induced autoimmune response MD play a causal role in NN . – Effects of diphtheria - tetanus - pertussis or tetanus NN on allergies and allergy - related respiratory NNS among NNS and adolescents in the NNP NNPS . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10714532 Review is made of 107 NNS of neurological complications of pertussis inoculation reported in the literature . The early onset of neurological NNS was characteristic , with changes of consciousness and convulsions as the most striking features . The question of aetiology is considered and contraindications are discussed …as is the grave danger of further inoculations when a previous NN has produced any suggestion of a neurological reaction . Aluminum Studies : – Do aluminum NN adjuvants contribute to the rising prevalence ofautism ? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22099159 “ … A second series of experiments was conducted on mice injected with six doses of aluminum hydroxide . Behavioural analyses in these mice revealed significant impairments in a number of motor functions as well as diminished spatial memory capacity . ” Experimental research , clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in NNS . In particular , aluminum in adjuvant form carries a NN for autoimmunity , JJ - term brain inflammation and associated neurological complications and MD thus have profound and widespread adverse NN consequences . click for entire NN – Mechanisms of aluminum adjuvant toxicity and autoimmunity in pediatric populations . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22235057 The findings suggest a possible role for the aluminum adjuvant in some neurological features associated with GWI and possibly an additional role for the combination of adjuvants ( Synergistic Toxicity ) . – Aluminum in the central nervous NN ( CNS ) : toxicity in NNS and NNS , NN adjuvants , and autoimmunity . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23609067 – Biopersistence and brain translocation of aluminum adjuvants of NNS . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25699008 – JJ -term Persistence of NN - Derived Aluminum Hydroxide is Associated with Chronic Cognitive Dysfunction . http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0162013409001895 – JJ - term follow - up of cognitive dysfunction in patients with aluminum hydroxideinduced macrophagic myofasciitis ( MMF ) . http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0162013411002194 – Integrating experimental ( in vitro and in vivo ) neurotoxicity studies of low - dose thimerosal relevant to NNS . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21350943 There is a need to interpret neurotoxic studies to VB deal with uncertainties surrounding pregnant mothers , newborns and JJ NNS who must receive repeated doses of Thimerosal - containing NNS ( TCVs ) . Information extracted from studies indicates that : ( a ) activity of low doses of Thimerosal against isolated JJ and NN brain NNS was VBN in all studies and is consistent with Hg neurotoxicity ; ( b ) the neurotoxic effect of ethylmercury has not been studied with co-occurring adjuvant - NNP in TCVs ; ( c ) NN studies have shown that exposure to Thimerosal - Hg can lead to accumulation of inorganic Hg in brain , and that ( d ) doses relevant to TCV exposure possess the potential to affect JJ neuro - NN . – Neonatal administration of thimerosal causes persistent changes in mu opioid receptors in the rat brain . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20803069 – Persistent behavioural impairments and alterations of brain dopaminesystem after early postnatal administration of thimerosal in rats . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21549155 – Maternal Thimerosal Exposure Results in Aberrant Cerebellar Oxidative Stress , Thyroid Hormone Metabolism , and Motor Behaviour in Rat Pups ; Sex - and Strain - Dependent Effects . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22015705 – Administration of thimerosal to infant rats increases overflow of glutamate and aspartate in the prefrontal cortex : protective role ofdehydroepiandrosterone sulfate . http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22015977 Thimerosal , a mercury - containing NN preservative , is a suspected factor in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders . We previously showed that its administration to infant rats causes behavioral , neurochemical and neuropathological abnormalities similar to those present in NN . The ACIP ’s recommendation of influenza NN during pregnancy is not supported by citations in its own policy paper or in current JJ literature . Considering the potential risks of maternal and fetal mercury exposure , the administration of thimerosal during pregnancy is both unjustified and unwise .

NNS IN polio , NN , diphtheria and rubella were once common in the NNP NNPS , afflicting hundreds of thousands of infants , NNS and adults , and killing thousands each NN . Some older Americans MD remember the fear associated with polio outbreaks and the era of iron lungs and leg braces — a NN when swimming pools and movie theaters closed over concerns about the spread of the crippling NN . Others MD recall the heartbreaking wave of rubella in the 1960s that resulted in thousands of newborn deaths , with thousands more born blind , deaf or with other lifelong disabilities . We cannot let NNP be faced with these fears again . For those of us who have treated critically ill NNS with NN - preventable NNS , we VBP firsthand the devastation to the child — and to the family and community — of a death , limb amputation or severe brain damage that MD have been avoided by a simple NN . Modern NNS are highly effective and safe , with most serious side effects being exceptionally rare — and much less serious than contracting the actual NN . But misinformation about NNS is still widely reported , so we feel it is crucial to VB clearly and unambiguously : NNS do not VB NN and they do not contain toxic chemicals . That fact was demonstrated again this week in a JJ NN on MMR NN by Danish NNS ."

Senator Ed Markey introduced a bill that MD funnel no less than a CD NN dollars toward the project . The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious NNPS NNS are working on a DNA NN that , instead of injecting a piece of NN into a NN to stimulate an immune response , MD inject synthesized genes . [ No matter what the promoters ( who will be given the NN ) VB , if genes are edited , deleted , or added , there inevitably will be unintended consequences . These unintended traits can never be removed from the JJ gene pool . Once monsters are created – RB accidentally – they will be with us forever . ] - GEG NNS ’s NNP Defense Note : CHD has internal documents in which the FDA acknowledges that technology that allows for the creation of these JJ NNS has outpaced their ability to predict adverse events . Should n’t our federal agencies be calling for a moratorium until we have that knowledge — especially since it is heavily reported that the CDC / FDA post - marketing surveillance systems are inadequate to pick up problems after licensure ? The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious NNPS ( NIAID ) has launched efforts to create a NN that MD protect NNS from most NN strains , all at once , with a single shot . Over the NNS , I ’ve written JJ articles refuting claims that NNS are safe and effective , but we ’ll put all that aside for the moment and follow the bouncing ball . Massachusetts Senator and JJ spender , Ed Markey , has introduced a bill that MD shovel no less than a CD dollars toward the universal flu-vaccine project . Here is a sentence from an NIAID press release that mentions CD of several research approaches : “ NIAID NNP Research Center NNS have initiated Phase 1/2 studies of a universal NN NN strategy that includes an investigational DNA - VBN NN ( called a DNA ‘ prime ’ ) … ” This is quite troubling , if you VBP what the phrase “ DNA NN ” means . It refers to what the experts are touting as the next generation of immunizations . Instead of injecting a piece of a NN into a NN , in order to stimulate the immune NN , synthesized genes MD be shot into the NN . This is n’t traditional NN anymore . It ’s gene therapy . In any such method , where genes are edited , deleted , added , no matter what the pros VBP , there are always “ unintended consequences , ” to VB their polite phrase . The ripple effects scramble the genetic structure in numerous unknown ways . This is genetic roulette with a loaded gun . Anyone and everyone on NNP injected with a DNA NN will undergo permanent and unknown genetic changes … Here is the inconvenient NN about DNA NNS — They will permanently alter your DNA . The reference is the NNP York Times , 3/15 / 15 , “ Protection Without a NN . ” It describes the frontier of research — the NN of synthetic genes to “ protect against NN , ” while changing the genetic makeup of NNS . This is not NN fiction : “ By delivering synthetic genes into the muscles of the [ experimental ] monkeys , the NNS are essentially re-engineering the NNS to resist NN . ” “ ’ The sky ’s the limit , ’ VBD Michael Farzan , an immunologist at Scripps and lead author of the JJ NN . ” “ The JJ JJ NN VBN on this strategy — called immunoprophylaxis by gene transfer , or I.G.T. — is underway , and several JJ ones are planned . ” [ That was three NNS RB . ] “ I.G.T. is altogether different from traditional NN . It is instead a form of gene therapy . NNS isolate the genes that produce powerful antibodies against certain NNS and then synthesize artificial versions . The genes are placed into viruses and injected into JJ tissue , RB muscle . ” Here is the punchline : Read that again : “ the synthetic gene is incorporated into the recipient ’s own DNA . ”"

While Moderna blitzed the NN , it revealed very little information — and most of what it did disclose were words , not NNS . That ’s important : If you ask NNS to read a journal article , they will scour NN tables , not corporate statements . With NN , numbers speak much louder than words . [ 2 ] But another vital point which the press release failed to emphasize was the JJ number of serious injuries caused by the NN in the JJ NNS . 3 of the 15 subjects [ 1 ] in the high dose cohort ( 250 mcg ) suffered a “ serious adverse event ” within 43 days of receiving Moderna ’s jab .

Donations to the fund will RB support the NN NN alliance Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ) and UNICEF , ” the release continued . “ The Together At Home effort will RB aid over 100 additional local and regional charities that will RB receive funds , including Education , Cannot Wait , Direct Care , Feeding NNP , and NNP NNP , among others . "" Changemakers , investors , and foundation leaders came together to contribute quickly to related efforts , IN strengthening NN care systems and investing in NN NN . ” Here is the NN featuring Michelle Obama and Laura Bush : “ We ’ve had the profound privilege of getting to VB you and your families . Your hopes , your struggles , and your triumphs , ” Obama VBD . “ The coming days will not be easy , but this JJ family of ours is strong . "" We will continue to be here for CD another , and we will VB through this NN together . Thank you . ” “ The spirit and courage of the JJ NNS is most evident in times of NN , and during this period of physical separation , we ’ve never been closer , ” Bush added . "" Not just in our great NN , but tonight we stand with the NNS of the NN . "" Meanwhile , three NNS from NNP York are suing the NNP NNP Organization ( WHO ) for ' incalculable ' damages over its response to the NN NN . They accuse the WHO of not reacting quickly enough to declare a NN , and RB covering up for Communist China . Additionally , US lawyers RB launched an unprecedented lawsuit against China . The landmark legal action , to sue the Chinese NN for trillions of dollars over the NN NN , accuses leaders of the ruling Communist Party of China ( CPC ) of negligence and an attempted cover - up of NNP - CD . The class - action lawsuit was filed in Florida and involved thousands of claimants from 40 NNS , including Britain and the U.S . As Neon Nettle reported earlier this month , an email released by Taiwan revealed the WHO RB received a warning in December about the NN outbreak in China but chose to ignore it , The Taiwanese NN VBZ WHO ignored its inquiries about NNP - CD , and they were denied adequate information to fight the NN . Michelle Obama 's decision to VB raise NN for the JJ NN NN , which covered for the communist Chineses and put the entire NN at NN , maybe a statement in opposing NNP . Still , it RB shows what side of the fence she is on . [ RELATED ] China - Owned Food Co Closes US Plants , Putting NNP 's Meat Supply Under Threat"

As much as was required after 9/11 ? Less ? More ? Considering some of the changes already happening and the JJ more recommended before airports can reopen safely to commercial routes , experts are referring to the NN NN as ‘ the JJ terrorism , ’ triggering the biggest NN the airline industry has ever faced . Let ’s start with the entire process of checking in for flights , which some calculate MD take up to four hours and involve JJ distancing , sanitation of passengers and luggage , wider spaces for various lines and waiting to board . Nine out of 10 experts expect slower turnarounds between flights due to the need of thorough cleaning of cabins and following of sanitary measures at airports . In the short run , though , it ’s expected that reduced passenger numbers and airlines traveling to a smaller pool of destinations MD reduce delays . • None NNP Airlines workers bring class action saying material in JJ gray uniforms made them sick • None The Brave NNP NNP of Bill NNP and NNP Telecom ” by Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. and Dafna Tachover What You Can Expect Among the steps under consideration : no cabin bags , no lounges , no automatic upgrades , face masks , surgical gloves , self - check - in , self - bag - drop - off , immunity passports , on - the - spot NN tests and sanitation disinfection tunnels . Digital technologies and automation will play a critical role in the future of NN travel . The need to reduce “ touchpoints ” at airports implies mandatory NN of biometric boarding that allows passengers to board planes with only their face as a passport . A number of airlines including British Airways , Qantas and EasyJet already are using the technology . According to the NNP Travel and Tourism Council ( WTTC ) , “ the ‘ JJ normal ’ at major airports , such as Heathrow , JFK and Singapore Changi will include almost exclusive NN of JJ check - ins , and contactless payments . Then there are the radical changes the airports will have to VB starting most probably with stopping non-fliers from entering at all except for unaccompanied minors or others who need assistance . They will need more extensive all - biometric check - in systems and efficient DYI for dropping off bags , ‘ travel bubbles , ’ or tunnels for disinfection . ( After being checked in , luggage MD RB be put through a disinfection fogging tunnel . ) They RB must install demarcation of the spaces for JJ distancing in corridors and concourses , larger spaces for queues and waiting , plexiglass or other protective barriers at customer service counters , hand sanitation stations and thermal scanning to check crowds for fever - grade NN temperatures , which already are in NN in some major airports . • None Bill NNPS ’ Philanthropy : 30,000 Indian girls VBN as guinea pigs to test cancer NN “ Only those ‘ fit to fly ’ will be allowed to enter , ” predicts the airline strategy firm SimpliFlying , in a recent report , where it identifies more than 70 different areas in the passenger journey that “ are expected to either VB or to be introduced from scratch , including having bags ‘ sanitagged ’ after VBG through fogging , electrostatic or UV - disinfection to restore confidence in flying after NNP - CD . ” The Telegraph explains that “ it MD sound futuristic , but UV sanitation is likely to become commonplace at the NN ’s airports . London Heathrow VBZ it is to begin trialling the process for its security trays . ” And then comes boarding The boarding process is expected RB to become ‘ touchless , ’ with options including facial recognition , already VBN in some U.S. airports for international flights . On the planes , there will be blocked seats , electrostatic spraying , personnel in protective gear and , of course , masks . Major JJ carriers such as NNP France and KLM already have made them compulsory and it ’s expected that all other airlines will do the same . As for food , the tendency is to stop serving altogether on short - haul flights , while the airlines consider ‘ light refreshments ’ for JJ - haul flights . Hong Kong Airlines has decided to stop offering food altogether . At the arrival point , SimpliFlying forecasts , international passengers will need to show some type of immunity document / passport , RB advocated by the International NNP Transport Association , IATA , to border NN agents . Once a NN has been VBN , that MD shift to a proof of NN . “ Arriving passengers will RB undergo another temperature screening at their final destination and potentially RB NN tests for NNP - CD , ” Conde Nast predicts . “ Some airports IN Hong Kong and Vienna are testing passengers for the NN with a NN test before they are allowed to enter the NN . Those types of tests , however , might be short - lived . ” Thermal testing is RB recommended by IATA , “ while Airlines UK , which represents British Airways , EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic , has VBN ‘ pre- screening ’ of travelers should be introduced ideally as early in the passenger journey as possible , ” reports The Telegraph . Although there are no standard decisions about making such tests and screening mandatory , airports and airlines are pushing for uniform regulations . It ’s not clear who will be responsible for checking travelers ’ temperatures and other NNP - CD NNS , for example . SimpliFlying predicts that a JJ federal NN agency likely will be created to coordinate NN screenings inside airports . As immediately following 9/11 , a process of NN - and - error is likely , with JJ airports and airlines following what some ‘ pioneers ’ establish . “ There will be JJ protocols for check - in involving digital technology ; hand sanitizer stations at frequent points including where luggage is stored ; contactless payment instead of cash ; using stairs more often than lifts where the CD - meter - rule can be harder to maintain ; and fitness equipment being moved for greater separation , among other examples , ” the WTTC wrote in a recent report . The international institution VBZ that the sector will face a gradual return to travel over the coming months as a “ JJ normal ” emerges before a NN becomes available on a mass scale , JJ enough to inoculate billions of NNS . Travel is likely to return RB to domestic markets with “ staycations , ” then to a NN ’s nearest neighbors before expanding across regions , and then finally across continents to welcome the return of journeys to JJ - haul international destinations . WTTC believes that younger travelers in the 18 - 35 age group , who appear to be less vulnerable to NNP - CD , RB MD be among the JJ to begin traveling again . According to Gloria Guevara , WTTC NN & CEO , traveling in the ‘ JJ normal ’ age requires coordinated actions , including JJ standards and protocols , “ for a safe and responsible road to recovery for the JJ Travel & Tourism sector as consumers start planning trips again . ” The JJ protocols and standards are being defined following feedback from associations representing the different travel sectors including International NNP Transport Association ( IATA ) , the Airport Council International ( ACI ) , Cruise Lines International Association ( CLIA ) , NNP NNPS Travel Association ( USTA ) , Pacific Asia Travel Association ( PATA ) , International Civil Aviation Organisation ( ICAO ) , the Organisation for NNP Co-operation and NNP ( OECD ) , the NNP Travel Commission ( ETC ) and the NNP Tourism Organisation ( UNWTO ) . But with protocols and standards , biometric systems , immunity passports and the best intentions for a safe road to recovery , the future of traveling , as NNP York Times ’s Niraj Chokshi explains , is still bleak : “ With much of the NN closed for business , and no widely available NN in sight , it MD be months , if not NNS , before airlines operate as JJ flights as they did before the NN . RB when NNS start flying again , the industry MD be transformed , much as it was after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks . ” And in the process , as it is already the NN , some airlines , especially smaller ones , will be push into bankruptcy or become takeover targets . “ Consumer fears about catching the NN on crowded planes MD lead to reconfigured seating . Carriers MD initially entice wary travelers with discounts , but if they can’t fill up flights , they MD resort to raising ticket prices . ” For Dave CalhounIn , CEO of Boeing , not only are the smaller airlines in danger . He thinks that at least a major U.S carrier will “ most likely ” VB out of business due to the NN NN . In an interview with NBC NNP ’ TODAY , on Tuesday he told Savannah Guthrie : “ … something will happen when September comes RB . Traffic levels will not be back to 100 % . They wo n’t RB be back to 25 % . Maybe by the end of the NN we approach 50 % . So there will definitely be adjustments that have to be made on the part of the airlines . ” Copyright 2020 – permission to reprint fully granted , WITH links to original story"

Learn_VB more_JJR about_IN sponsor_NN -_HYPH generated_VBN content_NN ._.","The NN is in a race to develop NNS against the novel NN NN - NN - 2 and the NN it causes , NNP - CD . We are determined to defeat this NN , which continues to infect millions of NNS and VB death and suffering IN the NN . Given the urgent NN , it ’s clear that a NN cannot be developed soon enough to VB stem the NN . With the goal of accomplishing what in normal times MD have been deemed impossible , we are engaging collaboratively with regulatory authorities to adapt traditional NN research and NN to meet this unprecedented challenge . With our partner BioNTech , a German biotech NN , we are developing not CD but at least four different NN candidates all at once . We began testing the NN in Germany on April 23 . This week , we ’re starting to test our mRNA NN candidates in a U.S. NN — only six weeks after kicking off our NN - CD partnership . Never in my over 25 NNS of developing NNS have I seen a JJ NN launched at this speed . RB , it takes NNS of dedicated research to VB to this point . This record milestone is a testament to the innovation and collaboration among NNS and colleagues from CD very different organizations and cultures , unprecedented access to advice and support from regulatory agencies and other NN agencies , and the willingness of NNS to VB above and beyond what is “ normal ” for them . Our approach is VBN on the same technology that we are developing in another partnership with BioNTech — an mRNA seasonal influenza NN , which has not yet entered JJ studies . If successful , that NN MD potentially transform the yearly “ scramble ” of producing a NN NN by increasing the speed of NN and coverage of circulating strains . We saw the opportunity to pursue a collaboration with BioNTech on the same platform technology for NN - CD , which MD potentially VB us develop a NN faster than using traditional approaches . Unlike JJ conventional NNS — which RB take months to NNS of research because they entail RB developing biological NN , NN or bacterial production processes — mRNA NNS are fully synthetic , well characterized and VBP nearly identical processes for purification . If the NN platform is proven to work , it MD allow us to quickly adapt the platform to other pathogens by exchanging the small portion of the NN - NN - 2 genetic code for that of another pathogen . In most conventional viral NNS VBN today , weakened or killed forms of a NN , or NN components of the pathogen VBN as antigens , are administered to a NN . The immune NN then recognizes these foreign NN components and unleashes a multipronged defense : special immune NNS to kill infected NNS and specific antibodies to prevent the NN from infecting our NNS . Then , if a vaccinated NN encounters the NN in the future , their immune NN already knows how to recognize , respond and defeat it before they become sick . The mRNA NN technology does not require the lengthy production of weakened or killed viruses or the viral antigen . Instead , mRNA , a set of genetic instructions coding for viral antigens , is injected into the NN . Once inside NNS , these instructions guide the NN ’s machinery to produce the antigens , which can then teach the immune NN how to recognize and fight off a future NN attack . In addition , RNA platforms can RB “ VB ” the immune NN mount a stronger response to an antigen than that induced by the antigen alone . The genetic material RNA can be seen by the immune NN as “ viral . ” That launches a potent arm of the immune NN called innate immunity , which recognizes patterns of common pathogens such as viruses and bacteria and increases the potency of the NN . JJ NNS at NN speed NN JJ NNS are typically run with only CD NN candidate in three separate phases , moving from small safety and immunogenicity studies then scaling up to JJ efficacy NNS that RB involve tens of thousands of participants . It ’s a deliberative and sequential process that can take JJ NNS . Due to the urgency of the NN , well - established JJ NN paths MD take too RB for us . To shorten the NN from preclinical to JJ evaluation , we are using a unique approach to test at least four different RNA NN candidates in parallel in a smaller number of JJ NN participants . The ongoing U.S. phase 1 / 2 NN uses a JJ NN design that maximizes NN speed while ensuring safety by quickly eliminating suboptimal NN candidates for the benefit of the “ winner ” in the race . Instead of using sequential individual NNS , we plan to adapt the same phase 1 / 2 NN in real NN and VBN on continuous NN collection to select the final NN candidate , ensure safety and tolerability and collect functional immunogenicity NNS to inform the seamless transition into the JJ efficacy stage of the NN . Given this design , we are shaving JJ NNS from the NN NN timeline , and assuming success , we ’ll potentially be able to roll out a promising NN candidate as early as fall 2020 . Early NN JJ NNS are typically done exclusively in younger populations RB and then tested in older populations . We are RB changing this NN : After determining the safety of each candidate ’s dose level in younger populations , we will then immediately test that dose level in older adults , so that necessary safety and immunogenicity NNS for the population most vulnerable to NNP - CD are available almost at the same NN to begin the efficacy stage of the NN . The NN against the NN The other critical aspect of creating a successful NN is ensuring that we can manufacture and distribute hundreds of millions of doses . Again we have changed the typical NN approach . Under normal circumstances , the investment of JJ hundreds of millions to billions of dollars is needed to build NN production capacity . These investments occur only after a NN candidate has proven itself to be safe and immunogenic . Today we are compressing a process that RB takes NNS to CD that MD take only several months , with huge upfront investments of capital and resources before we have JJ evidence that the NN candidate MD be successful . To that end , we are working together with BioNTech and Pfizer ’s NN teams to quickly scale up infrastructure and try to eliminate any potential bottlenecks in sourcing the materials needed to produce hundreds of millions of NN doses in record NN . I ’ve dedicated my scientific career to creating and developing NNS so that vulnerable populations all over the globe can be protected from NN and death . I have witnessed firsthand the tremendous NN of NNS to VB lives and VB ensure that NNS have a fighting chance to grow up healthy . NN R&D has always been challenging , but there is normally sufficient NN to solve scientific problems during NN . The current NN has turned our NN upside down as NN is the CD thing we do not have . We are all energized and inspired to offer potential solutions with an unprecedented sense of urgency to VB what seemed impossible only a couple of months RB now possible . The ongoing experience has fortified my belief in the NN of NN , NNS , NN care professionals and others working closely to address the NN . This NN is our enemy .

No , they have a patent and already have the antidote ( MAR. 16 , 2020 ) — This is CD of the most important posts we have ever released . In the last 48 hours — just as the NNP lock down was occurring in the US — NNS uncovered the likely culprits behind the NNP bioweapon . Despite the obvious U.S. Patent . No. 10,130,701 held by The Pirbright Institute ( UK ) operated by The Wellcome Trust , no NN in the mainstream NN is talking about this glaring fact . RB the alt - NN is mute . We VBP because the culprits are using every propaganda trick in their playbook to prevent a light being shined on the British Privy Council and the Queen . China has been blamed , sort of , although the specifics are vague . We have shown that just a four - hour drive from Wuhan is Nanchang and the Merial NNP NNP Institute NN NNS for The Pirbright Institute . The decision by The Pirbright Institute ( Wellcome Trust ) to move their Merial NNP NN NN plant offsite was taken after a virulent NN and mouth outbreak at their Merial plant . On Oct. 12 , 2009 , Merial moved their plant to Nanchang , China and slapped a JJ “ Boehringer Mannheim “ shingle on their Merial Pirbright UK plant , then carried on merrily . Same plant , different name , same controller : Wellcome Trust . This means the British have , RB now , a Merial ( Wellcome Trust ) NN NN plant just four hours away from NNP ground zero . But , why is no NN pointing out this obviously suspicious FACT . All it MD take to release the NNP in Wuhan is for an employee at Merial to VB in the car a vile of NNP vile , and sprinkle it RB in Wuhan . Better yet , send a 5G signal in Wuhan ( a 5G test city ) to instruct NNP nanotubes developed by just indicted Harvard Professor and popular Wuhan NNP of Technology nanotechnology lecturer Dr. Charles Lieber to release their deadly NNP microbe payloads . VB previous post . WHO WAS THE WELLCOME TRUST CHAIRMAN WHO SET UP THE MERIAL NANCHANG PLANT NEAR WUHAN ? The Wellcome Trust chair was Baroness Elizabeth Lydia Manningham - Buller , the JJ director of British MI5 ( 2002 -2007 ) . Her mother was GCHQ . Her father was Privy Council , Attorney General and Solicitor General , with a “ Bullying Manner . ” She is an eighth - generation peer . That ’s not all , Manningham - Buller RB chaired Genome Research Limited ( 2008 - CD ) , a wholly - owned subsidiary of Wellcome Trust . That ’s not all , Manningham - Buller RB chaired Genome Research Limited ( 2008 - CD ) , a wholly - owned subsidiary of Wellcome Trust . In Oct. 2013 , Baronness Manningham - Buller was the keynote speaker at the Pilgrims of Great Britain London at the Sir Harry Brittain Memorial Lecture . Sir Harry Brittain was the founder of the Pilgrims Society ( with about 50 British peers including Viscount Alfred Milner and Winston Churchill ) in 1902 . MI5 , MI6 and GCHQ were founded from newspapermen who attended the Pilgrims ’ NNP Imperial Press Conference , 1909 . Given her father ’s membership in the Privy Council and her Wellcome Trust intimacies , her membership in the Privy Council and the Pilgrims Society are certain . Operating from the same Wellcome Genome Campus is Genomics England Limited ( controlled by the Queen ’s Golden Share ) . Of particular note are CD Genomics England director - chairs : We have already written about Sir Chisholm ’s formation of QinetiQ ( when SERCO moved into the U.S. ) and the fact that JJ C.I.A. director George Tenet , and JJ vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Edmund P. Giambastiani Jr. were QinetiQ directors . QinetiQ has been awarded over $ 8 CD in U.S. contracts in NN , satellites , information technology , JJ and NN agencies . VB previous post . QinetiQ has received over $ 8.5 CD U.S. federal contracts . ( PDF | Excel - downloads directly to your Downloads folder ) . SERCO has received over $ 9.5 CD U.S. federal contracts . PDF | Excel - downloads directly to your Downloads folder ) While our research zeroed in RB RB on the Anglo - NNP Pilgrims Society as the actual “ Deep NN ” globally , and while we have gotten tantalizingly close to find this NN , his or her name has alluded us . Now we have VBN him : Sir Jonathan Richard Symonds . On Sep. 01 , 2019 , Symonds was appointed chairman of GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Plc , the successor to Glaxo Wellcome . GSK is strategically aligned with Wellcome Trust where JJ MI5 director Manningham - Buller is the current chair . Symonds has been a director of HSBC Holdings plc since 2014 - just months after James Comey left an HSBC directorship to become NNP director . He has been HSBC deputy group chair since 2018 , he was RB chair of HSBC Bank plc ( 2014 - 2018 ) until just recently . Symonds was RB chief JJ officer of NN manufacturer Novartis AG ( 2009 - 2013 ) . Prior to Novartis , Symonds was managing director of Goldman Sachs ( 2007 -2009 ) . Symonds was RB chief JJ officer of AstraZeneca PLC ( 1997-2007 ) . Here is the lynchpin that shows Symonds is the organizational Deep Throat of the Anglo - NNP Pilgrims Society . He was director and audit chair of the newly - formed QinetiQ ( Feb. 28 , 2003 - Jun. 30 , 2004 ) THE PRIVY COUNCIL’S ACCOUNTANT FOR THE QUEEN’S “ GOLDEN SHARE ” CONTROLS NN COMMERCE Symonds was QinetiQ ’s second director just RB enough to set up the chart of accounts and the share stock structure giving the Monarch ’s Special Share ( “ Golden Share ” ) NN of the NN no matter how JJ sub-classes of stock were established . QinetiQ shares property with The Pirbright Institute ( Wellcome Trust ) , the patent holder of the NNP financed by Wellcome Trust and the Bill and Melinda NNP Foundation . VB RB NNP Traced to the British Crown . Our latest discovery that Baroness Eliza Manningham - Buller , JJ head of MI5 ( 2002 - 2007 ) , is chair of Wellcome Trust and their related DNA - harvesting research associates , further confirms that the Anglo - NNP Pilgrims Society are making their move to dramatically reduce the NN population by attacking our NN streams Their secret JJ communications network is being managed by the Anglo - NNP Pilgrims Society that is protected by the British Privy Council and the NNP Senior Executive Service ( SES ) They operate a secret JJ satellite NN for themselves out of the Cobbett Hill Earthstation adjacent to The Pirbright Institute ( UK ) — on the NN of the 2007 NN and mouth outbreak ( READ : There are demons in those fields ) Yes , this is hard to VB , but these facts are now screaming for us to pay attention . We have our blessed NNS and beautiful NN to save . Betsy and Thomas had a few things to VB about M , Q , James Bond , and the Queen . Listen to audio below :"

That 's the question NNP Donald NNP asked during a White NN roundtable discussion between his NN task force and pharmaceutical NN executives on Monday ( March 2 ) . His question was answered with a direct "" no "" from an executive . The is designed to prevent infections with viruses , which are very different than coronaviruses . But the answer is slightly more complicated than that : The NN NN wo n't prevent you from getting a NN , but it can VB officials better respond to the outbreak of NN - CD , the NN caused by the JJ NN . "" I do VB immunizing NNS against influenza has a very important indirect effect , "" VBD Dr. Albert Ko , a professor and department chair at the Yale School of NNP NNP . RB , NN care workers are already burdened by NN NNS so getting a NN shot , reduces the number of NN patients , thereby helping to "" relieve pressures "" in hospitals RB treating patients with NN - CD , he VBD . But there 's another reason a NN shot MD improve the NN 's response to the JJ outbreak : the U.S. is lagging behind other NNS in testing for NNP - CD . And that 's unlikely to improve in the near term . On Thursday ( March 5 ) , Vice NNP Mike Pence , who is leading the administration 's response to the NN , announced that the U.S. does not have enough test kits to meet demand . How does that relate to the NN ? If NNS VBP their NN shots , fewer NNS come down with the NN and come into clinics with nonspecific NNS such as fever and cough , which overlap with . Having fewer NN patients will VB it easier to find the patients with NN - CD , he VBD . Higher NN rates MD "" VB us much more efficient in detecting NN , "" NNS , Ko told Live NNP . Finding NN - CD NNS is still akin to picking a "" needle out of a haystack , "" but reducing NN NNS can "" decrease the haystack , "" he added . As NNP - NNP - 2 is spreading in communities on both coasts of the U.S. , distinguishing between NN and NNP - CD will become more difficult . On the bright side , it is "" incredibly rare , "" to catch both the NN and NN - CD at once , VBD Dr. Eric Cioe Peña , director of NNP NNP , Northwell NNP in NNP York and an emergency room physician . "" RB if they have CD , they do n't have the other . "" NN NN is naturally dying down as spring approaches , but for those who have n't yet done so , "" we still recommend getting a NN shot , "" he added . NNS with the NN are still coming into the hospital and there 's always a chance there MD be a second spike of the NN , Peña told Live NNP . That being VBN , NN NNS in NNP York City have been down 25 % each week for the past CD weeks , he VBD . It 's a positive step "" that we are n't seeing as JJ NN patients in the ER , so we have more room for severe NN patients , "" Peña VBD . At Northwell NNP , patients are n't being tested for NN - CD unless they meet criteria for admission to the hospital .

Those behind the activity are not named in the alert but are thought to include China , NNP and Iran . The three NNS have all seen major outbreaks of the NN but have denied previous claims of involvement in such activity . The joint advisory VBZ the UK and US are currently investigating a number of incidents in which other NNS are targeting pharmaceutical NNS , JJ - research organisations , and universities , looking for intelligence and sensitive NNS , including research on the NN . Understanding how other NNS are dealing with the NNP - CD NN and progress in research has become a high priority for intelligence agencies IN the NN . In a NN , every NN will VB to VB its intelligence capability to better inform itself . And in a locked - down NN , cyber - espionage is more practical than traditional JJ espionage , making it another field where an existing trend towards JJ working MD be accelerated . Analysts VBP they are seeing a particular rise in aggressive operations from a range of NNS at the moment . And this has meant organisations that might not have considered themselves to be top targets for hackers from foreign NNS are now in their sights . • A SIMPLE GUIDE : How do I protect myself ? • AVOIDING CONTACT : The rules on self - isolation and exercise • TESTING : Can I VB tested for NN ? The UK's National Cyber Security Centre ( NCSC ) has been working with these organisations since the start of the NN , to offer advice and protection . And the JJ JJ advisory , issued jointly with its US equivalent , the Cyber- security and Infrastructure Security Agency ( CISA ) , aims to further increase awareness of the threat . "" In today 's NN , there is nothing more valuable or worth stealing than any kind of biomedical research that is VBG to VB with a NN NN , "" senior US intelligence official Bill Evanina told BBC NNP last week . At Tuesday 's daily briefing , Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab VBD : "" As well as providing practical advice , the UK will continue to counter those who conduct cyber - attacks .

"" UK authorities are understood to have offered advice to Oxford NNP , at the leading edge of developing a NN , and Imperial College in London , which has played a key role in the epidemiological modelling that has shaped policy responses . The advisory warns cyber - spies are targeting supply chains and taking advantage of NNS remotely working , with a technique called password - spraying - in which they try to VB commonly VBN passwords to access accounts . And cyber - criminals MD target healthcare providers , knowing they MD be RB more willing than usual to pay a ransom for the return of their NNS . "" Protecting the healthcare sector is the NCSC 's JJ and foremost priority at this NN and we 're working closely with the NHS to keep their systems safe , "" operations director Paul Chichester VBD .

And_CC it_PRP would_MD go_VB against_IN almost_RB every_DT other_JJ virus_NN that_WDT we_PRP ’ve_VBP known_VBN about_IN ,_, she_PRP says_VBZ ._.","Getting ahead of the NN Viruses are stealthy . They disguise themselves as they infect a host and penetrate that host ’s NNS , which gives them a head start over the NN ’s immune response . Once a NN recognizes certain telltale signs of a pathogen , it throws out an alarm signal to the immune NN . But because the NN has that head start , it still has NN to replicate itself and infect a JJ host before the immune NN can catch up . That ’s why someone ’s JJ experience with an infectious NN can be so nasty . The immune NN is not so easily tricked a second NN : When it ’s beaten an invader once , it keeps a specialized weapons cache dedicated to that particular pathogen , ready to mount a high - speed reaction if it ’s ever detected again . So , the second NN the NN shows up in your NN , the NN wo n’t have that handy head start . To have herd immunity , each infected NN must , on average , infect less than CD NN ( though clearly , it ’s not possible to infect half a NN ; if some infected NNS pass on the infection and others do n’t , the average transmission rate will be less than CD . ) Once the transmission rate drops below CD , a community has herd immunity . That wo n’t stop each and every NN , but it will prevent the NN from spreading indefinitely . JJ of our lessons on herd immunity come from the NNS , because it 's so contagious . The more infectious a NN is , the more NNS who need to be immune to reach herd immunity . CD NN with NNS , for instance , MD infect up to 18 other NNS in a susceptible population . To VB that transmission rate all the NN down to less than CD , almost everyone in the population needs to act as a buffer between an infected NN and a JJ potential host . That ’s why NNS needs such a high rate of herd immunity — RB 95 percent . The do ’s and don’ts of making a herd NNS create a weapons cache for a NN without the NN ever having to fight off the NN itself , which is why herd immunity is something that ’s generally pursued through NN rather than infection . For example , about 30 percent of NNS NNS have complications such as seizures , pneumonia , and encephalitis , resulting in about CD deaths for every thousand NNS in the U.S. Exposing a whole population to NN MD be a dangerous NN to cultivate herd immunity among the survivors . “ The problem with NN is that no - PRP has had it before , regardless of age , ” VBZ Gostic of the NNP of Chicago . It ’s almost as if chicken pox had just emerged for the JJ NN , leaving adults more susceptible to the more severe NNS that come with age , she explains . Herd immunity RB is n’t something that can work for any NN . It does n’t matter how JJ NNS are vaccinated against tetanus , for example : If someone who is n’t vaccinated steps on a rusty nail , they can still VB infected , because tetanus lives in reservoirs outside of the JJ NN . An infection must be transmitted between NNS for herd immunity to have a protective effect . Immunity RB does n’t always last that RB . HIV mutates so quickly that it can actually evolve within a single NN , VBZ Jessie Abbate , an infectious NN expert at the Research Institute for NNP in France . Swiftly mutating NN is RB a moving target for immunity and NNS , which is why each NN NN ’s NN needs to anticipate the strain that will circulate widely , she explains . What does this mean for NN ? Four other coronaviruses already circulate among NNS , VBZ Gaunt , and they all VBP the common cold , since we do n’t stay immune to those viruses for very RB . If the novel NN is similar , that means that NNS MD need to be repeatedly vaccinated or infected for herd immunity to be sustained . Some reports describe reinfections of the novel NN in NNS who tested positive again after they had already recovered . It ’s not clear , though , that these are actually NNS of reinfection — it ’s more likely that they can be explained by NNS continuing to shed the NN for a JJ NN , and that the level of NN shedding fluctuates over NN . Rapid reinfection is , for now , “ an outside possibility , ” Abbate agrees . If NNS were able to VB sick again RB quickly , we MD n’t VB the rapid decline in NN numbers that is happening in certain parts of the NN . And it MD VB against almost every other NN that we ’ve VBN about , she VBZ ."

Ackerman explains , “ It ’s VBG to be an interesting depression because we have all the infrastructure of affluence . We have achieved a pinnacle of affluence , and the metaphor I VBP is riding to the soup kitchen on an $ 8,000 trail bike . . . . I hope we find things that VBP NN worth VBG on without all the stuff . So , we are VBG to be in a period of living without all the good stuff , and that is VBG to be the norm . There is RB a RB hopeful side to JJ distress , but we are most surely headed into a period of severe distress . . . and a period of living without . We will find we are not living without things that are intrinsic to JJ nature that are good . . . . We VBG to have to find ways to VB along because we are headed into hard times . ” A few NNS RB , Ackerman predicted that the trend for interest rates was down . The 10 NN Treasury is now near a record low . Does Ackerman VB rates VBG RB lower ? Ackerman VBZ , “ Yes , I VBP lower rates . I VBP we will have lower rates until , at some point in the future , NNS will start sniffing out a hyperinflation . You VBP I have been a deflationist for a lot of NNS . I VBP we will have to cross the valley of deflation , but somewhere there is a hyperinflation . It wo n’t take high interest rates to do it because we will be dealing with a real burden of debt that is VBG to be crushing no matter where interest rates are RB if they are fixed at 2 % . ” Ackerman sees the 10 - NN Treasury hitting “ .25 % . ” Is real estate a safe bet ? Ackerman VBZ , “ When real assets start to sink IN real estate , what are you VBG to do ? Are you VBG to send mortgage checks out on behalf of homeowners to the lenders ? . . . . You ’d have to be crazy to VB when real estate opens up it will be trading at the prices in February . We will VB a 25 % haircut from the NN VB . . . because we are VBG to have to deal with a lot of speculative excesses . . . . Minimum , it will be down 25 % , which will bring us close to the 2007 - 2008 where real estate across the NN lost about 33 % of its value . I have been saying for a JJ NN that real estate will sink 70 % with maybe a 90 % drop in second homes . Everything has come back from the last NN , but I VBP we are VBG to do the whole 70 % drop in value this next NN . ” Ackerman RB thinks cash will be valuable in the future because it will be rare . Ackerman points out that the “ debt being destroyed and defaulted on dwarfs the amount of NN printing ” for now , and that is deflationary . So , he likes cash in the near term and gold in the longer term . Ackerman contends , “ What do we VB to buy stuff now ? We VBP credit cards or real cash pretty much . If we have deleveraging of the derivatives NN and the daisy chain and clearing relationships for credit cards and debit cards . . . I do n’t VB that NN MD survive the implosion of the derivatives NN . So , it leaves you with cash and barter . I hate to VB it , but we are VBG to VB there at some point . . . . This MD happen tomorrow because of some little accident . You do n’t VB –like nobody knew the NN was coming . ” Ackerman VBZ he likes gold because RB in deflation , debt default and destruction , “ Gold will hold its value . . . . Gold is catching on now because of uncertainty and not inflation — yet . ” In closing , Ackerman VBZ , “ I still VBP we are VBG to have a deflationary abyss to cross before we VBP to the hyperinflation of the mind where NNS realize the NN ’s obligation either to default on Treasury debt or not is the crux of the hyperinflation argument . Yes , at that point , I have to acknowledge the Fed can print NN without limit , and they MD have to . ” Join Greg Hunter as he goes CD - on - CD with analyst / trader Rick Ackerman .

The NN being named to the position is a JJ executive with GlaxoSmithKline , a criminal corporation that admitted to a JJ - scale felony bribery scheme in its $ 3 CD settlement with the DOJ . GSK ’s bribery scheme involved 44,000 doctors and violated the laws of every NN in the nation . With no qualms about doing business with corporate felons , NNP NNP is now jumping in bed with NNP Pharma criminals to turn the JJ NNS into JJ guinea pigs in order to push NNP Pharma profits and try to boost the stock NN in NN for the November elections . And instead of choosing to work with a corporation that has no criminal record , he chose the NN maker that has the worst criminal record across the entire NN industry . Moncef Slaoui , a JJ GlaxoSmithKline executive , will lead “ Operation Warp Speed , ” NNP ’s push to accelerate the NN NN process for NNP - CD , according to an administration official . Slaoui is to serve in a volunteer capacity , and will be assisted by Army Gen. Gustave Perna , the commander of NNP NNPS Army Materiel Command . If you ’re wondering why a US Army general is getting involved with the GlaxiSmithKline NN push , it ’s because NNP has just announced he ’s VBG to “ rapidly mobilize ” the US NN to distribute the NN , according to CBS NNP : “ We ’re mobilizing our JJ and other forces but we ’re mobilizing our NN on the basis that we do have a NN . You VBP , it ’s a massive job to give this NN . Our NN is now being mobilized so at the end of the NN we ’re VBG to be able to give it to a lot of NNS very , very rapidly , ” the NN VBD It ’s quite clear that NNP is describing a JJ - run forced NN program that involves mandatory injections , “ to a lot of NNS very , very rapidly . ” Why MD the US NN be required to distribute a NN ? Because , of course , the NN wo n’t be optional . NNP NNP is VBG to VB the NNP NNPS NN to force vaccinate millions of Americans against their will . NNP has sold out NNP and is now VBG to turn the JJ NNS into live JJ guinea pigs for NNP Pharma ’s mad NN experiments . The entire “ Operation Warp Speed ” scheme is about skipping safety tests and JJ NNS in order to roll out a risky , untested , unsafe NN that will be injected into you at gunpoint . That ’s why the NN is about to be deployed across the NNP NNPS to administer NNS . NNP has betrayed his nation and the JJ NNS . He is now an agent of NNP Pharma and the anti-human rights NN industry that uses JJ NNS for JJ experiments , all IN the NN . It wo n’t be just any normal NN , either . Yesterday the Dept. of Defense issued a press release celebrating its effort to acquire 500 CD “ ApiJect ” NN injection devices to be ready for the NN NN . As described on the ApiJect NN , the ApiJect syringe features RFID tracking and GPS geo-location combined with JJ NN sharing with a NN cloud : With an optional RFID / NFC tag on each BFS prefilled syringe , ApiJect will VB this possible . Before giving an injection , the healthcare worker will be able to launch a free mobile app and “ tap ” the prefilled syringe on their phone , capturing the NFC tag ’s unique serial number , GPS location and date / NN . The app then uploads the NNS to a NN - selected cloud database . Aggregated injection NNS provides NN administrators an evolving real - NN “ injection map . ” So the NN will be “ mobilized ” across NNP to administer forced NNS that are tagged with RFID and GPS location NNS , linked to your personal identification and synced with a NN database that will of course be VBN very soon to enforce “ immunity passports ” and other Bill Gatesian ideas rooted in JJ tyranny . Are you getting the picture yet ? NNP Trump. GlaxoSmithKline . Operation Warp Speed . JJ Tech censorship of “ anti-vax ” information . Department of Defense . JJ deployment . “ Injection map ” tracking with GPS and RFID … Are you getting the picture yet ? You are about to be tagged , gagged and bagged , then medically raped by an armed agent of the NNP administration . NNP has sold you out to the NN industry , and he ’s about to roll out a JJ - JJ dictatorship across NNP . This is VBG to turn most of his existing base against him , by the NN , which is why his odds of being re-elected are plunging by the day . We had previously estimated just a 1 in 8 chance of him winning re-election , but now we estimate a 1 in 4 chance that he will somehow find a NN to cancel the elections and declare himself a JJ dictator , assuming NN during the very “ emergency ” that he helped create through his own NN denialism and the selling out of the JJ NNS to the NN industry . We are calling on NNP to declare whether these JJ - backed NNS are intended to be optional or mandatory . And if NNP wo n’t answer the question , you can conclude they will be mandatory . NNP is following in the footsteps of tyrannical dictators who carried out mass genocide against their own NNS That means NNP is setting himself up along the lines of Stalin , Mao and Pol Pot to VB down in history as a genocidal maniac who mass murdered his own NNS in order to appease his corporate puppet masters . Look at the facts . The DoD announcement . The ApiJect RFID technology . The “ rapid mobilization ” of the US NN to “ distribute ” the NNS . Look at who ’s running the White NNP NN response : Dr. Fauci , the criminal at the NIH who funneled NN to the Wuhan virology lab that engineered the very same bioweapon that ’s now ravaging our NN and resulting in forced lockdowns . Look at how no action has been taken against Obama , James Comey or the Clintons . Ever wonder why ? Because they ’re all working for the same globalist agenda . NNP Pharma has conquered the White NNP , and they already VBP the NN and NNP Tech . Now they ’re coming for your NN , and anyone who resists will likely be medically raped with a forced NN injection that was never subjected to rigorous JJ NNS or typical safety standards . NNP NNP is now all - in with NNP Pharma and its globalist agenda of mass JJ extermination and depopulation . Have no illusions . Connect the dots . This conclusion is now inescapable , RB for those of us who voted for NNP and supported him in CD . NNP is now an agent of NNP Pharma and the NN industry . Prepare to join the pro-human resistance against NNP and NNP Pharma . If you allow yourself to be injected with this euthanasia NN , you will be killed by a subsequent infection after the Fauci / Wuhan “ NNP - 21 ” bioweapons release next NN ."

French NNP Emmanuel Macron , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and NNP African NNP Cyril Ramaphosa were among those who joined a NN conference to launch what the WHO billed as a "" landmark collaboration "" to fight the NN . The aim is to speed NN of safe and effective drugs , tests and NNS to prevent , diagnose and treat NN - CD , the lung NN caused be the novel NN - and ensure equal access to treatments for rich and poor . "" We are facing a common threat which we can only defeat with a common approach , "" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus VBD as he opened the virtual meeting . "" Experience has told us that RB when tools are available they have not been equally available to all . We can not allow that to happen .

"" We must VB sure that NNS who need them VB them , "" VBD Peter Sands , head of the JJ Fund to Fight on AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria . "" The lessons from AIDS must be learned .

"" This is a JJ step only , but more will be needed in the future , "" von der Leyen told the conference . Leaders from Asia , the Middle East and the Americas RB joined the videoconference , but several JJ NNS did not participate , including China , India and NNP . A spokesman for the U.S. mission in Geneva had earlier told Reuters that the NNP NNPS MD not be involved . "" Although the NNP NNPS was not in attendance at the meeting in question , there should be no doubt about our continuing determination to lead on JJ NN matters , including the current NN NN , "" he VBD by email . "" We remain deeply concerned about the WHO 's effectiveness , given that its gross failures helped fuel the current NN , "" he later VBD . U.S. NNP Donald NNP has lambasted the WHO as being slow to react to the outbreak and being "" China - centric "" and announced a suspension of funding . Tedros has steadfastly defended the WHO 's handling of the NN and repeatedly committed to conducting a post - NN evaluation , as the agency does with all crises . Macron , Merkel , Ramaphosa , and Spain 's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez were among those voicing strong support to WHO . Macron urged all G7 and G20 NNS to VB behind the initiative , adding : "" And I hope we 'll manage to reconcile IN this joint initiative both China and the U.S. , because this is about saying ' the fight against NNP - CD is a common JJ good and there should be no division in order to win this battle ' . "" Merkel VBD : "" This concerns a JJ JJ good , to produce this NN and to distribute it in all parts of the NN . "" Ramaphosa , chairman of the African Union , warned that the continent - with its generally poor standards of healthcare - was "" extremely vulnerable to the ravages of this NN and is in need of support "" . More than 2.7 CD NNS have been infected with NN - CD and nearly 190,000 have died from it since the JJ NN emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last NN , according to a Reuters tally . "" As JJ diagnostics , treatments and NNS become available , we have a responsibility to VB them out equitably with the understanding that all lives have equal value , "" VBD Melinda NNP , co-chair of the NNP Foundation , which was WHO 's second largest donor last NN .

"" We need to ensure that there are enough NNS for everyone , we are VBG to need JJ leadership to identify and prioritise NN candidates , "" he told a Geneva NN briefing . Yuan Qiong , senior legal and policy advisor at Medecins Sans Frontieres ( MSF ) Access NNP welcomed the pledges but called for concrete steps . "" There should n't be any patent monopoly and profiteering out of this NN , "" she told Reuters ."

Psychologists call this continuous partial attention , and it applies as much to virtual environments as it does to real ones . VB of how hard it MD be to cook and read at the same NN . That 's the kind of multi-tasking your brain is trying , and often failing , to navigate in a group NN chat . This leads to problems in which group NN chats become less collaborative and more IN siloed panels , in which only CD NNS at a NN talk while the rest listen . Because each participant is using CD audio stream and is aware of all the other voices , parallel conversations are impossible . If you view a single speaker at a NN , you ca n’t recognise how non-active participants are behaving — something you MD normally pick up with peripheral vision . For some NNS , the prolonged split in attention creates a perplexing sense of being drained while having accomplished nothing . The brain becomes overwhelmed by unfamiliar excess stimuli while being hyper - focused on searching for non-verbal cues that it ca n’t find . That ’s why a traditional phone call MD be less taxing on the brain , Franklin VBZ , because it delivers on a small promise : to convey only a voice . By contrast , the sudden shift to NN calls has been a boon for NNS who have neurological difficulty with in - NN exchanges , such as those with NN who can become overwhelmed by multiple NNS talking . John Upton , an editor at the NNP Jersey - VBN NN outlet NNP Central , recently VBD out he is autistic . Late last NN , he was struggling with the mental load of attending packed conferences , engaging during in - NN meetings , and navigating the small - talk that ’s common in work places .

By the end of March , the three - month figure was 96.6 % - down from 97 % . Uptake rates of CD dose of MMR by the age of five have remained above the NN 's 95 % target since 2009 . Scotland 's chief JJ officer welcomed the figures but urged teenagers heading abroad on holiday to VB sure they are fully protected . Dr Catherine Calderwood VBD JJ adults remained vulnerable to a recent JJ surge in NNS as a result of anti-vaccine publicity in the early 2000s . She VBD : "" We are pleased to VB the RB good statistics in Scotland once again . "" We have been over our 95 % target since 2009 , so the level of immunity against NNS in particular in Scotland is very high . "" NNS seem to be wanting to come forward and have their NNS done because they understand how important it is . "" Dr Calderwood added that an increase in NN NNS IN the NN should not be ignored . "" There was a period of NN about 15 or 20 NNS RB when our NN levels were not as good , "" she VBD . "" Those babies at that NN are now teenagers and JJ adults . They MD not VB that they were not vaccinated or they MD not have had the second dose . "" So I MD RB encourage them if they are travelling abroad , or attending festivals or sporting events where there are lots of NNS , to check out whether they have been vaccinated and that they are fully protected . "" The latest NN figures show more than 95 % of NNS had received each routine immunisation by the NN they were 12 months of age . • What are NNS , how do they work and why are NNS sceptical ? Uptake of rotavirus NN , which helps protect JJ NNS from infection that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting , was 93.1 % by 12 months of age . This NN is given within strict age limits which , according to the NHS Scotland report , "" explains the slightly lower uptake rate compared with other NNS offered in the JJ NN of NN "" . • By 24 months of age , 94.2 % of NNS had received the Hib / MenC booster NN . • The uptake rate for the Pneumococcal Conjugate NNP ( PCV ) booster was RB 94.2 % . • Uptake of the MenB booster NN by 24 months has remained at 93.5 % . • Uptake of CD dose of MMR NN by 24 months of age remained unchanged this quarter at 93.6 % . ' We 're now happy with the jags ' Fife teenager Jake Sykes has had his MMR vaccinations at the age of 16 after his NNS decided against it when he was a baby . His father Paul VBD his son's childhood allergy to nuts , eggs and dairy raised their concerns because some of the NNS VBD egg proteins . In 1998 , Andrew Wakefield published a report falsely linking NN and bowel NN to the MMR NN . RB though his paper was discredited and he was struck from the JJ register , there was a drop in the number of NNS vaccinated after his claims . Mr Sykes , from Cupar , VBD their fears had now been allayed . "" At the NN , we were living in London and there was a fear that MMR might VB NN , "" he VBD . "" But that link , I VBP , has been disproven and now we 're happy for him to VB the jags . "" With the increase in NNS of mumps and NNS and things IN that , we thought it was a good thing to VB it done now . "" The NHS VBZ NNS work by making NNS produce antibodies to fight NN without actually infecting them with it . It VBZ the immune NN of a vaccinated NN who comes into contact with the NN will recognise it , and immediately produce the antibodies to fight it .

RB then , Newsom reserves the NN of : • The NNP NNP NNP Officer to revise the criteria and procedures of Stage CD “ as she deems necessary to respond to the dynamic threat posed by COVID19 ” ; and of • County and local NN officers “ to establish and implement JJ NN measures within their respective jurisdictions that are more restrictive than ” the statewide Stage CD policy . As an example , Newsom ’s Stage CD announcement conflicts with a more restrictive mandate issued Monday in six Bay Area counties ( Alameda , Contra Costa , Marin , San Francisco , San Mateo and Santa Clara ) which continues to prohibit most retail businesses , except for “ essential ” businesses such as grocery NNS , from opening through NNP 31 . Newsom VBD counties can keep their more strict guidelines in place and do not have to come into compliance with the NN order : “ We are not telling locals that feel it ’s too soon , too fast to modify . ” SFGate reports that the “ lower - NN businesses ” that are allowed to reopen in Stage CD include bookstores , clothing shops , sporting goods NNS and flower shops , provided that ( a ) their local officials give approval ; and ( b ) the businesses VBP changes in their operations , such as having workers wear masks . Newsom will detail the JJ guidelines and requirements later this week . Dine - in restaurants and offices will be part of a “ later Stage 2 opening ” –whatever that means . More disturbing still is what Newsom VBD at a press briefing in Sacramento yesterday — California will not return to “ normal ” until there is immunity from the Wuhan NN NNP - NNP - 2 via a NN . He VBD : Readers ’ comments on SFGate are mostly critical of Newsom . The best comment is this NN from reader “ gilgotha ” : The problems with a NN are : • Although by Moderna Therapeutics , a biotech NN VBN in Cambridge , Mass. , and the NIH is readying the NN for JJ testing , it MD be 12 to 18 months at best before it ’s ready for the NN — which means California wo n’t return to normal until CD to 1 ½ NNS from now , at best . • The Wuhan NN has already mutated into at least 30 different strains , which means whatever NN that is developed will not be 100 % effective , just as the NN for the seasonal NN is , at best , only partially effective . As an example , the 2019 - 2020 seasonal NN NN is only — “ effective ” defined as reduction in NN ’s visits for NN illness . • According to a JJ survey , CD - third of Americans VBP they wo n’t VB vaccinated against the Wuhan NN RB if / when a NN becomes available .

The NNP - CD NN left Katie Viney , her husband Tony and their daughter Rhiannon locked down at home near Oxford , England . They did n’t VB to stand by and do nothing , and they MD now VB down in NN history by all taking part in Britain ’s JJ JJ NN of a potential NN . "" So JJ other NNS have been able to do their bit and I just thought , I 'm not a nurse , I 'm not a trained NN , so this is the thing I can do , "" CD - NN - JJ Rhiannon told Euronews . The Vineys are among more than 1,000 healthy volunteers recruited for the NN , led by the NNP of Oxford . Half of the participants are getting the prototype NN , the others a placebo . The British NN VBD this week it was pumping more NN into such efforts to develop a NN , by giving an additional 84 CD pounds ( €94 CD ) to the NN underway in Oxford as well as toward a separate NN NN at Imperial College London . All participants in the Oxford NN have now received their dose , Business Secretary Alok Sharma VBD on Sunday . If it proves a success , the NN plans to roll out the NN to 30 CD NNS by September . The Vineys have been regularly taking their temperatures , keeping an eye out for any NNS . "" We 've had absolutely no side effects whatsoever , RB , I can't RB feel where I 've had the injection . And I 'm not at all worried , I 've got no concerns about having this , "" VBD Katie . "" The hope , as with everybody , is that we find that NN that MD let the NN VB back to whatever ' normal ' becomes , "" VBD Tony . "" It 's RB nice to be able to volunteer for something IN this , and we feel a bit honoured to be able to do that , truthfully . "" What is the NN being tested ? The NNP of Oxford announced in April that it had reached a deal with AstraZeneca that MD VB the pharmaceutical NN manufacture and distribute the NN globally . The NN candidate , called ChAdOx1 nCoV - CD , is made from a weakened version of a common cold NN that causes infections in chimpanzees , and that was genetically modified so that it cannot develop in NNS . Further genetic material was added to VB the spike NN VBN on the NN of NNP - NNP - 2 , the NN that causes NN - CD . That spike NN , which binds to receptors on JJ NNS , is believed to play a key role in infecting NNS with the JJ NN . As a whole , the NN prototype aims to VB the NN recognise and develop an immune response to that spike NN , to stop the NN from infecting JJ NNS . How is it being tested ? NNS now VBP to VB whether the NN triggers an immune response to stop NN - CD infection – and keep any side effects in check . Volunteers are given either the NN NN candidate or an existing NN against meningitis that ’s VBN as a ‘ NN ’ for comparison . The meningitis NN is typically given to teenagers or VBN as a travel NN . The reason for selecting it rather than saline NN , for instance , is because NNS expect the NN NN to VB some small side effects such as a sore arm , headache and fever . If they VBD saline , which MD VB no such side effects , they fear participants MD automatically VB whether they were given the JJ NN or the placebo . "" It is critical for this NN that participants remain blinded to whether or not they have received the NN , as , if they knew , this MD affect their NN behaviour in the community following NN , and MD lead to a bias in the results of the NN , "" the NN explains . When will we VB whether or not it works ? To assess whether the NN protects from NN - CD , NNS will compare the number of infections in the NN group with the number of infections in the vaccinated group . The NN therefore relies on some participants developing NN - CD . And how quickly they VBP infected and transmit the NN will influence how quickly the NN will yield results . The NN expects to collect enough NNS within six months at most . If the results are encouraging , late - stage NNS of the NN 's effectiveness MD take place in the second half of this NN . That 's much faster than usual procedures , which RB take several NNS . If the NN does n’t show positive results in the JJ phase , the NN MD decide to VB dosing or stop the NN altogether . Getting a NN to NN RB takes NNS , not months , and some experts have warned that the magic bullet against NNP - CD MD never be VBN . With no guarantee of success on a NN , Oxford NNP is RB leading what it describes as the NN 's biggest NN NN . HIV and anti-malarial drugs , as well as an antibiotic , are among those being tested on NNP - CD patients . Professor Richard Haynes , who coordinates the Recovery JJ NN at the NNP of Oxford , VBZ it ’s important to continue hunting for effective treatments too , as “ some NNS will end up in hospital RB when we have a NN . ” “ Over the past eight weeks , we 've now recruited over 10,000 NNS from over 180 different hospitals . We 're testing lots of different treatments and at the moment it 's too early to VB whether any of them are beneficial or not . We wo n't VB . But hopefully , we 'll VB some answers over the summer , "" he VBD . You can RB watch Damon 's report in the NN player above ."

The immune NN is the NN 's defense against infections . The immune ( ih - MYOON ) NN attacks germs and helps keep us healthy . What Are the Parts of the Immune NN ? JJ NNS and organs work together to protect the NN . White NN NNS , RB called leukocytes ( LOO - kuh - sytes ) , play an important role in the immune NN . Some types of white NN NNS , called phagocytes ( FAH - guh - sytes ) , chew up invading organisms . Others , called lymphocytes ( LIM - fuh - sytes ) , VBP the NN remember the invaders and destroy them . CD type of phagocyte is the neutrophil ( NOO - truh - fil ) , which fights bacteria . When someone might have bacterial infection , doctors can order a NN test to VB if it caused the NN to have lots of neutrophils . Other types of phagocytes do their own jobs to VB sure that the NN responds to invaders . The CD kinds of lymphocytes are B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes . Lymphocytes start out in the bone marrow and either stay there and mature into B NNS , or VBP to the thymus gland to mature into T NNS . B lymphocytes are IN the NN 's JJ intelligence NN — they find their targets and send defenses to lock onto them . T NNS are IN the soldiers — they destroy the invaders that the intelligence NN finds . How Does the Immune NN Work ? When the NN senses foreign substances ( called antigens ) , the immune NN works to recognize the antigens and VB rid of them . B lymphocytes are triggered to VB antibodies ( RB called immunoglobulins ) . These proteins lock onto specific antigens . After they 're made , antibodies RB stay in our bodies in NN we have to fight the same germ again . That 's why someone who gets sick with a NN , IN chickenpox , RB wo n't VB sick from it again . This is RB how immunizations ( NNS ) prevent some NNS . An immunization introduces the NN to an antigen in a NN that does n't VB someone sick . But it does let the NN VB antibodies that will protect the NN from future attack by the germ . Although antibodies can recognize an antigen and lock onto it , they can't destroy it without NN . That 's the job of the T NNS . They destroy antigens tagged by antibodies or NNS that are infected or somehow changed . ( Some T NNS are actually called "" killer NNS . "" ) T NNS RB VBP signal other NNS ( IN phagocytes ) to do their jobs . • neutralize toxins ( poisonous or damaging substances ) produced by different organisms • activate a group of proteins called complement that are part of the immune NN . Complement helps kill bacteria , viruses , or infected NNS . These specialized NNS and parts of the immune NN offer the NN protection against NN . This protection is called immunity . NNS have three types of immunity — innate , adaptive , and passive : • Innate immunity : Everyone is born with innate ( or natural ) immunity , a type of general protection . For example , the NN acts as a barrier to block germs from entering the NN . And the immune NN recognizes when certain invaders are foreign and MD be dangerous . • Adaptive immunity : Adaptive ( or active ) immunity develops throughout our lives . We develop adaptive immunity when we 're exposed to NNS or when we 're immunized against them with NNS . • Passive immunity : Passive immunity is "" borrowed "" from another source and it lasts for a short NN . For example , antibodies in a mother 's breast milk give a baby temporary immunity to NNS the mother has been exposed to . The immune NN takes a while to develop and needs NN from NNS . By getting all your child 's recommended NNS on NN , you can VB keep your child as healthy as possible ."

There_EX is_VBZ no_DT cure_NN for_IN post_NN -_HYPH polio_NN syndrome_NN ._.","There are three VBN serotypes ( closely related though distinguishable forms ) of wild poliovirus : PV1 , PV2 , and PV3 . The most - widespread serotype is PV1 . PV2 likely has been eradicated ; the last PV2 NN was reported in 1999 in Uttar Pradesh , India . The third serotype , PV3 , is close to eradication . Polio , in full poliomyelitis , RB called infantile paralysis , acute viral infectious NN of the nervous NN that RB begins with general NNS such as fever , headache , nausea , fatigue , and muscle pains and spasms and is sometimes followed by a more - serious and permanent paralysis of muscles in CD or more limbs , the throat , or the chest . More than half of all NNS of polio occur in NNS under the age of five . The paralysis so commonly associated with the NN actually affects fewer than 1 percent of persons infected by the poliovirus . Between 5 and 10 percent of infected persons display only the general NNS outlined above , and more than 90 percent show no signs of illness at all . For those infected by the poliovirus , there is no cure , and in the mid-20th NN hundreds of thousands of NNS were struck by the NN every NN . Since the 1960s , thanks to widespread NN of polio NNS , polio has been eliminated from most of the NN . It is now endemic in only three NNS : Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Nigeria . Nigeria , however , was on the brink of being polio - free in CD . Worldwide , since 1988 the number of reported polio NNS has dropped by more than 99 percent . The course of the NN Poliomyelitis means “ gray marrow inflammation , ” referring to the propensity of the poliovirus to attack certain NNS in the spinal cord and brainstem . The poliovirus is a picornavirus ( family Picornaviridae ) , a member of a group VBN as enteroviruses that inhabits the JJ digestive tract . ( JJ beings are the only VBN hosts of the poliovirus . ) The NN enters the NN most often by the so - called fecal–oral route — that is , from fecal matter taken into the mouth through contaminated food or fingers . It can RB enter by ingestion of droplets expelled from the throat of an infected NN . JJ victims MD become ill about 7 to 14 days after ingesting the NN . Infected persons MD shed the NN from their throats for a week , beginning a day or more before suffering any NNS themselves , and they MD continue to shed the NN in their feces for a month or more after their illness . After the poliovirus is swallowed , it multiplies in lymph nodes of the intestinal tract and spreads through the NN via the bloodstream . In some NNS the NN gets no farther , causing only a vague flulike illness to develop . The most - common early NNS of polio are mild headache , fever , sore throat , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , restlessness , and drowsiness . Fever peaks in CD to three days and then rapidly subsides , and patients recover within three to four days without the NN of paralysis . In some NNS , however , the NN begins an assault on the central nervous NN , inflaming and destroying motor NNS of the spinal cord and brainstem . In those NNS patients become irritable and develop NN in the back and limbs , muscle tenderness , and stiff neck . JJ recover at that stage , but approximately 1 in 200 persons with polio develops what is VBN as flaccid paralysis . The motor impulses that normally move along the nerve fibres from the spinal cord to muscles are blocked , and , as a result , muscles become limp and cannot contract . The extent of paralysis depends on where the NN strikes and the number of nerve NNS that it destroys . NNS that are not severely injured recover their normal function in NN ; to the extent that they do recover , a corresponding restoration of muscle function MD be expected . NNS that are destroyed , however , are not replaced , because nerve NNS cannot regenerate . In that NN the paralysis is complete and permanent , with associated progressive atrophy of the unused muscles . In most NNS paralytic polio strikes the limb muscles , particularly the legs . Paralysis does not always involve the limbs , however . The abdominal muscles or the muscles of the back MD be paralyzed , affecting posture . The neck muscles MD become weak , so that the head can not be raised . Paralysis of the face muscles MD VB twisting of the mouth or drooping eyelids . In some types of spinal polio , the NN damages the upper part of the spinal cord , with resulting difficulties in breathing . In bulbar polio the NN attacks the brainstem , and the nerve centres that VBP swallowing and talking are damaged . Secretions collect in the throat and MD lead to suffocation by blocking the airway . Some 5 to 10 percent of persons afflicted with paralytic polio die , RB of respiratory complications . There seem to be individual differences in the degree of natural susceptibility to the NN . JJ persons have acquired antibodies to the poliovirus in their NN without having had any NNS of infection . It is generally held that a lasting immunity follows recovery from the NN . However , because there are three different serotypes of poliovirus , second attacks can occur . Persons who recover from an infection caused by CD serotype of poliovirus are permanently immune to reinfection by that serotype but not to infection by the others . For that reason polio NNS are trivalent — that is , designed to generate antibodies to all three poliovirus serotypes ( VB below ) . Among as JJ as CD - quarter of JJ polio victims whose condition has been stabilized for NNS or RB decades , a condition called post - polio syndrome has been recognized . Post - polio syndrome manifests itself as increased weakness , muscle atrophy , or other conditions involving the originally affected muscle groups or a different group of muscles . The NN of the syndrome is not VBN for certain , but it MD arise when nerve branches grown by nerve fibres that survived the original infection begin to deteriorate as the JJ polio victim passes through middle age . There is no cure for post - polio syndrome ."

But while there are claims that it MD be possible for a NN to be ready within a NN , the chances of this happening remain slim . The UK NN , led by the NNP of Oxford , will ultimately involve 1100 adults , half of whom will receive the experimental NN . The other half will VB a meningitis NN as a NN . The NN behind the NN hopes to move on to tests to gauge how effective the NN is against the NN as early as August , raising hopes that a NN MD be ready before the end of the NN , and that this MD be the answer to the difficult question of how the NN gets out of strict JJ distancing measures . Unfortunately , these hopes are probably misplaced . NN design expert Maria Bottazzi of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , Texas , calls the schedule “ unrealistic ” . RB if everything goes according to plan in the JJ phase of NNS , Bottazzi points out that NNS will still need NN to determine how well the NN protects NNS from NN - CD and whether it provokes any side effects when a vaccinated NN is subsequently exposed to the NN . It is far from guaranteed that the NN will be safe and effective . 2013 NN calculated that , before entering JJ NNS , the average experimental NN has a 6 NN cent chance of ultimately reaching the NN . Of those that VBP it into NNS , a 2019 analysis suggests the probability of success is 33.4 NN cent . But RB if the Oxford NN succeeds , there will then be the issue of scaling up NN to VB hundreds of millions of doses . According to Bottazzi , this is the real bottleneck . Under the best of circumstances , the NN is still looking at 12 to 18 months before a NN MD be widely available , she VBZ . That in itself MD be a remarkable achievement . The 2013 NN VBD that between 1998 and 2009 , the average NN taken to develop a NN was 10.7 NNS . It is possible to speed this up to some extent – since then , an Ebola NN has become the fastest - developed NN ever , being produced in just five NNS . But to lower this to just 18 months MD require the next steps of the NN process to be begun before the previous ones were completed , Bottazzi VBZ . This increases the NN of significant loss of investment should the NN fail to pan out , as well as raising questions about safety . An expedited path from early NNS to scaled - up NN MD mean that NNS wo n’t have as much NN to VB the JJ - term effects of a NN in NN participants before it is given to the NN , for example . “ Between 1998 and 2009 , the average NN taken to develop a NN was 10.7 NNS ” To try to speed things up , on 21 April , UK NN minister Matt Hancock VBD that the NN will put NN into NN capability , in the hope that either the Oxford NN , or another NN being tested by Imperial College London , will prove successful . Similar measures are being taken elsewhere . US philanthropist Bill NNP has announced he is helping to build NN capability for seven candidate NNS – a strategy he VBD will lose billions of dollars but save NN . More than 100 NNS for the NN are currently in various early stages of NN . The more that are tested , the higher the chances of finding something that is both safe and effective . Yet there is no guarantee that it is RB possible to vaccinate against the NN . There is a lot we do n’t VB yet about how our immune systems respond to the NN , and whether it is possible to induce RB - lasting immunity to it . Hancock RB VBD that the NN is “ throwing everything ” at developing a NN NN . But given the NN it will take to VB CD – if it RB proves possible to do so – it is clear that NNS can’t wait for a NN to VB them out of their current crises . As epidemiologist Mark Woolhouse at the NNP of Edinburgh , UK , told NNP Scientist in early April : “ I do not VB waiting for a NN should be dignified with the word ‘ strategy ’ . It ’s not a strategy , it ’s a hope . ” We need to be realistic about the hopes of a NN , but that does n’t mean it is n’t worth trying . IN annual NN NNS , an effective NN NN MD VB us protect those most at NN from the NN . As with childhood NNS for NNS and other NNS , it MD RB enable us to protect future generations from NN - CD . But it MD be NNS before we have a NN . Until then , we will need to deal with multiple waves of infection with measures such as extensive testing , contact tracing and quarantining ."

"" NNP Donald NNP , who has repeatedly touted unproven NN drugs at White NNP briefings , was more upbeat about the NN results . "" It 's a very positive event , "" he VBD . NN participants who received remdesivir recovered in an average of 11 days compared with 15 days for patients in the NN group , who received a placebo . Eight percent of remdesivir patients died during the NN versus 11 percent in the placebo group . The death rate is just slightly lower in the remdesivir group , but more NNS remains to be analyzed , Fauci VBD . But the scientist , who has led NIAID since 1984 , VBD the NN reminded him of the day 34 NNS RB when modest results for the NN AZT signaled the JJ potential weapon against HIV . "" That was not the end NN , because building on that every NN after we did better and better , we had better drugs of the same type , and we had drugs against different targets , "" Fauci VBD . AZT , or azidothymidine , was originally developed as a cancer NN . In March 1987 , it won FDA approval — in record NN — for NN against HIV , at a NN when infection often led to a quick and painful death . The medicine came with rough side effects , and questions about whether it actually extended NN . It took another decade before NNS developed the combination antiretroviral drugs that transformed HIV into a chronic NN . NNS IN the NN have been racing to find NN treatments , but no NN has been definitively proven effective . Other early NNS for remdesivir have been mixed , including a pair of studies whose results were released hours ahead of the NIAID findings . Gilead released its own NN results this morning suggesting that severely ill patients receiving five days of remdesivir fared just as well as patients receiving a 10 - day dosing regimen . More than half of both dosing groups were discharged from the hospital within CD weeks of beginning their medication . Eight percent of NNS in the five - day group died while 11 percent in the 10 - day group died . But another 10 percent in the longer dosing arm had to discontinue NN because of serious side effects , and the NN lacked a NN group . Gilead VBD the NNS RB suggests that NNS who received remdesivir early in their infection seemed to fare better than those that received it later . The NN is not a traditional NN with a placebo arm to compare against remdesivir for effectiveness , earning Gilead some criticism from policy experts over sharing the NN alongside the NIAID results . "" Piggybacking the severe NN release on [ the NIAID NN ] is the part which is unjustifiable , "" VBD Peter Bach , director of Memorial Sloan - Kettering 's Center for NNP Policy and Outcomes . Calling Gilead 's results positive RB though they came from a NN without a NN group "" has no basis in scientific inquiry , "" he added .

"" Most of the NN , it does n't impact you — these NNS are so rare that you might never face the situation , "" Anderson VBZ . "" But when it does happen , it has a pretty JJ impact . "" Students arrive at school without their shots for lots of reasons . In low - income neighborhoods , access to doctors has RB been an issue . Newly arrived immigrants often appear without proof of immunization or with a spotty history of vaccinations . In some NNS , NNS scared of their NNS receiving more shots have decided to slow or stop the NN schedule . Anderson VBD lost or missing records can be a huge problem if NNS VBP doctors or move . Nearly 270 of the schools with the highest incomplete record rates were in Los Angeles ' Unified School District . At a handful of schools with the most extreme NNS , as JJ as nine out of every 10 NNS begin kindergarten under the NN 's conditional entry program for students missing some NNS or their immunization paperwork . "" I VBP that sounds alarming , "" VBZ Tonya Ross , the district 's director of nursing , but she points out that conditional students in most NNS have received at least some of their immunizations and that RB if students receive CD NN shot — instead of the recommended CD — they still have 95 % immunity . Despite an outbreak of NNS that began at nearby Disneyland , not a single NN has appeared among students in the district 's schools , she VBZ . "" RB most of our students who have exemptions have some immunizations , "" she VBZ . "" The kids are for the most part protected . "" Whether they — or any of the NNS across the NN whose NN status is recorded as "" incomplete "" or "" conditional "" — ever VBP fully caught up on NNS is less clear . In Virginia , 104 schools have conditional entry rates above 10 % . NNS have 90 days to VB their NNS caught up , NN epidemiologist Sandra Sommer VBZ . Sommer 's office does n't track or follow up on the conditional enrollment figures provided by each school , she VBZ . More than half the schools with high conditional enrollment are in Northern Virginia 's Fairfax NN district , but only a "" low "" number of students have been taken out of school for failure to comply with the law . Los Angeles school district officials MD n't VB how JJ students had been taken out of school for not completing their vaccinations . "" That 's always a last resort , "" Ross VBZ . "" We VBP all kids to be in school . "" Epidemiologist Saad Omer of Emory NNP 's NNP Center VBD his research had shown that JJ students who fall behind on immunizations never catch up . "" We do VB that some NNS eventually complete , but a majority of them do n't , "" he VBZ . To look at the issue of incomplete records , USA TODAY analyzed immunization NNS collected from more than 42,000 JJ and private schools in 25 NNS across the NN . Half the NNS do n't require schools to report incomplete NNS — Massachusetts , Illinois , Minnesota , NNP York and Arizona are among those . Some track the matter internally — Illinois law dictates that each school must keep a list of all students who are n't fully vaccinated . In Arizona , NN law VBZ students without proof of all vaccinations are required to stay home during outbreak incidents . This NN , unvaccinated students at CD California high schools — in Huntington Beach and Palm Desert — were told to stay home after NNS NNS were diagnosed . Starting in April , California 's Oakland Unified School district wo n't allow students to attend school unless they have all their NNS on file or have an exemption . The district has 40 schools that had conditional entry rates over 10 % at the beginning of the school NN . Spokesman Troy Flint VBZ those numbers are mostly because of untrained staff and spotty internal record keeping . Last week , the district trained employees how to properly report and follow up on vaccinations . "" I 've seen this happen in schools where you do the training , and the NN rate goes from 20 % to 90 % , it was all just clerical error , "" he VBZ . Ross VBZ her district works to VB that students receive all their shots . School administrators pass pamphlets to NNS about JJ NN and school - VBN clinics . In areas where students often do n't regularly VB a NN , school nurses host NN clinics . Nurses VBP the NN 's immunization registry to check whether proof of immunization for students has ever been entered in another city . "" We do hear a lot about that it 's a burden for schools to monitor this information , "" VBZ Shannon Stokley , associate director for NN at the CDC ""s immunization services division . "" But it 's in their best interest , so they VBP their NNS are protected . "" Steve Reilly and Elizabeth Weise contributed to this report"

Or should it be required only for school NNS , with a JJ exception allowed , and for groups IN front - line NN - care workers ? Some officials might VB few or no requirements at all because they VBP enough NNS will VB the NN voluntarily or have immunity from an infection to halt the spread of the NN . But in NNS IN Oklahoma , efforts to require and promote the NN MD run into strong headwinds . Anti-vaccine activists are vocal and influential in the NN , spurred on by a national movement . It ’s CD reason Oklahoma is CD of only 15 NNS , including Texas and Arkansas , that allow NNS to cite personal reasons to exempt their NNS from immunizations required by schools and day - care centers . They fill out and turn in a form . All NNS grant exemptions for JJ reasons , and 45 NNS plus Washington , D.C. , allow exemptions for religious objections . NN skeptics have successfully fought off efforts in the Legislature and NN NN to tighten exemptions . Just this NN , a NN advisory committee proposed requiring NNS who opt out of vaccinations for their NNS for religious or personal reasons to RB attend a NN education session at their local NN department . It RB proposed that exemptions expire after sixth grade unless NNS renew them . Both failed to advance . A key reason driving proposals IN these is Oklahoma ’s rising numbers and rates of exemptions . In 2018 - CD , the overall exemption rate for all kindergarteners was 2.6 % , up from 2.2 % in CD - 18 and 1.9 % in CD - 17 , according to the Oklahoma NNP Department of NNP . In 2009 - 10 , the exemption rate was 1.1 % . The number of approved NN exemptions doubled from 2,417 in 2014 to 5,082 in 2019 . Liza Greve , executive director of the Oklahomans for NNP and Parental Rights Foundation , a nonprofit that promotes what is often called NN choice or NN freedom , VBD she believes there ’s a good chance Oklahoma will add a NN - CD NN to its NN schedule for NNS , and NN - care workers will be required to take it . But her organization will advocate for an individual ’s NN to choose . “ Whatever shakes out , Oklahomans need to have a choice in NN and NN , ” she VBD , citing concerns that rapid NN of a NN - CD NN will heighten risks of adverse reactions . Dr. Ervin Yen , an Oklahoma City anesthesiologist who advocated for stronger immunization policies during his four NNS in the Oklahoma Senate , VBD he thinks the federal NN should require the NN for all citizens because of how deadly and contagious the NN is . But he believes the decision will be left up to the NNS . “ I VBP a significant number of NNS will mandate it , and I VBP Oklahoma will have to consider it , ” Yen VBD . Oklahoma requires NNS entering school to be vaccinated for nine NNS , including NNS , chickenpox and polio . NNS can apply for exemptions on JJ , religious or personal grounds . JJ exemptions represent the smallest share of school exemptions in the NN . NN Majority Floor Leader Jon Echols , R - Oklahoma City , anticipates the NN NN department MD update the NN schedule for NNS to include NN - CD once a safe and effective NN is available and the Legislature MD approve it as RB as NNS MD apply for the same exemptions . “ I VBP it MD be widely VBN , ” Echols VBD . “ I MD take it . ” But a general requirement to be vaccinated MD not fly , Echols VBD . “ There ’s no chance of the Oklahoma Legislature passing a NNP ’s Republic of China mandate , ” he VBD . Nationwide nearly half the NNPS require JJ adults be vaccinated against meningococcal NN before heading to college , and 15 NNS RB require the hepatitis B NN . But unlike policies for NNS , few requirements exist for adult immunizations in the U.S. and little JJ NN infrastructure supports mass NN of adults , according to the National Conference of NNP Legislatures . Doctors and NNS VBP every NN has an adverse reaction rate . For the NNS NN , it is CD IN 1 CD NNS vaccinated , according to the NNP NNP Organization . “ But you save 40 to 50 NNS ( IN CD ) from dying , ” Yen VBD . The benefits of the eventual NN - CD NN will “ hugely outweigh the risks , ” he VBD . “ NN is RB deadlier than NNS . ” RB if the death rate turns out to be only 1 % , a NN given to 1 CD NNS MD save 10,000 lives , Yen VBD . NNS across the globe are fast - tracking NN of a NN - CD NN , with 118 candidate NNS in the works , the NNP NNP Organization reports . Of those , eight are in JJ or JJ NNS and 110 are not yet being tested on NNS . It ’s not clear when a safe and effective NN MD be developed and available for distribution . Predictions have ranged from 12 or 18 months to at least a few NNS out , and residents in developed NNS , or ones that originate a successful NN , MD gain NN immunity RB , while more impoverished NNS wait . The U.S. Food and NNP Administration is streamlining its processes for NN NNS and therapeutic treatments . “ The FDA is VBG to rush it through , ” VBD William Hildebrand , a research professor at the NNP of Oklahoma College of Medicine who is among the JJ NNS worldwide working to create a NN . “ The NN is demanding it . ” Hildebrand ’s NN is looking at using the NN ’s protective T - NNS to find and kill NN - infected NNS , rather than developing a NN that helps the NN produce antibodies . It ’s a JJ shot , he VBD . “ Everybody ’s odds are a little JJ ( individually ) , but collectively our odds are pretty good , ” Hildebrand VBD . “ The odds are pretty good the scientific community is VBG to come up with something that will stop this NN . ” For a NN to stop the spread of an infectious NN , a sufficiently high number of NNS must be immune to the NN . That provides indirect protection , or herd immunity , to those who are n’t vaccinated or who have compromised immune systems and are at greater NN of catching an infection , including babies , older adults or NNS with certain JJ conditions . Herd immunity for each NN is VBN on how JJ additional NNS each infected NN will VB during their infectious period . CD NN with NNS , for example , will infect 12 to 18 others , so , VBN on a complex calculation , 90 % of the population needs to be vaccinated to ensure the NN does not spread . In the NN of NNP - CD , the NN shows an infected NN will pass it along to about three others , meaning about 70 % of the population will need to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity , VBD Gary Raskob , dean of the OU College of NNP NNP . An analysis by the Journal of Infection in mid-March estimated that the percentage of a population that must be immune via NN or natural immunity to halt the spread of NN - CD varies by NN . In Kuwait , it ’s less than 6 % ; in Japan , 33 % , and in Spain , 81 % . The percentages are VBN on R - naught values , the epidemiological number for the reproduction rate of the NN . “ The NN will be crucial , ” Raskob VBD . “ We have to VB the NN to understand the importance of NN . ” JJ acceptance likely will be better than for the NNS NN , he VBD . “ Since NNS was eradicated , JJ NNS have never seen a NN of NNS , RB most physicians practicing today , ” Raskob VBD . Not so with NNP - CD . NNS are reminded daily of the severe and fatal effects of the NN and JJ NNS have personal experience with it . NNS are likely to be waiting in line as production scales up once the FDA approves a NN , he VBD . If there ’s not enough NN to meet the initial demand , it MD likely VB RB to NN - care workers and then the most vulnerable population , Raskob VBD . Hospitals and JJ - term care facilities will have the ability to require that employees be vaccinated over any personal objections , he VBD . Oklahoma law currently requires hospital employees to provide documentation of immunity to NNS , mumps , rubella and varicella . Several hospitals have adopted the Oklahoma Hospital Association policy that supports mandatory employee influenza vaccinations as a condition of employment in hospitals . ‘ We Have to Proceed With Caution ’ Amid the quest for a NN NN , suspicion gathers among networks and groups that object to JJ proven NNS and NN requirements . A NN published this week in the NN journal Nature VBD nearly 100 CD NNS expressing views on NN on NNP and concluded the explosive growth in anti-vaccination views MD increase opposition to a future NN NN and “ amplify outbreaks , as happened for NNS in 2019 . ” The Oklahomans for NNP and Parental Rights political action committee , which contributes to NN legislative campaigns , VBZ NNS have been linked to chronic childhood conditions , including NN , asthma , diabetes and obesity . Claims IN these are made by other anti-vaccination groups despite research to the contrary showing NNS are generally safe . Greve , who leads the PAC as well as the nonprofit advocacy group , VBD supporters are following the NN - CD NN NN and keeping an eye on safety and efficacy studies . “ Sometimes in an emergency situation , corners are cut when they should n’t be , ” Greve VBD . “ The evolving NN is moving very quickly . When it comes to a NN , we have to proceed with caution . ” CD concern is the NN of immune enhancement , in which a NN actually weakens a NN ’s response to the NN so the NN becomes sicker , Greve VBD . An example occurred when an investigational NN against respiratory syncytial NN ( RSV ) backfired in the 1960s . In CD NN , the hospitalization rate of infants who were vaccinated approached 80 % compared to 5 % for those not vaccinated , and CD toddlers died , according to the National Institutes of NNP ’s National Library of Medicine . Greve ’s advocacy group supported a dozen NN - related bills filed this legislative session , including efforts to protect personal exemptions and establish a stronger tracking NN for reporting any injuries or deaths from vaccinations . Hildebrand , of the OU College of Medicine , VBD multiple studies are underway to provide the answers NNS need to develop an effective NN - CD NN in record NN . He VBD the rush to discover a NN means the result MD carry a greater NN of serious reaction than normal . “ This NN might be more relaxed or liberal in its acceptable adverse reaction rate , ” he VBD . When the NN is available , he VBD , NNS will have to ask themselves what ’s riskier , the odds of an adverse reaction or the danger of getting the NN .

CD NN for leaders to earn their followers ’ trust in a NN is through self sacrifice–either through their own giving or that of the organization . The author ’s research shows that when leaders sacrifice in this NN , it makes employees feel more positively toward them and more committed to their organizations . But to reap the benefits , leaders must give with purpose , and be transparent about why and how much they are giving . You might VB that crises tend to bring out the worst in NNS , but that is n’t reflected in how we view our leaders , at least . In fact , crises VBP us to view leaders as more charismatic and effective than we normally do . This is probably why U.S. presidents are almost universally re-elected in times of NN . And research has shown that leaders who self - sacrifice tend to be seen as the most effective . Following 9/11 , I was so intrigued by NN leadership that I did a NN on the topic . In my research I VBD that leader self - sacrifice , such as cutting PRP ’s own salary or giving up PRP ’s own benefits , caused employees to feel more positively toward their leaders and more committed to their organizations during crises . This finding has been corroborated by additional research in the lab and field that suggests that when leaders demonstrate self - sacrificial behavior , it makes us VB them as having higher moral values and as being a better role NN — leading to better organizational outcomes . More recently , we have seen CEOs step up to support their employees during this NN by pledging not to lay off employees — RB those who can not VB into work . For example , RB though all of Patagonia ’s NNS are closed , CEO Yvon Chouinard has announced that the NN will continue to pay all employees , leading some to conclude that the values - driven organization will survive the NN while other organizations will fail . Other CEOs who have committed to no layoffs include Hearst CEO Steven Swartz , LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner , NNP and Square CEO Jack Dorsey , Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman , Citigroup CEO Mike Corbat , Bank of NNP CEO Brian Moynihan , Visa CEO Alfred F. Kelly Jr. , and FedEx CEO Frederick Smith , Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins . So , what can leaders do in this NN to support their employees and how can they be sure that their giving hits the mark ? Effective measures fall into three categories : taking some of the same hits as your staff ; giving with a larger purpose in mind ; and being aggressively transparent RB when it ’s hard . Self - sacrifice is not just about the NN doing what ’s JJ . If you are VBG to ask your employees to sacrifice , you need to sacrifice as well . If you expect your NN to behave safely , you as a leader should behave safely . If you expect your NN to VB down in the trenches , you should be down there with them . No NN likes the leader who throws their NN on the front line while they sit in their office . Marriott International CEO Arne Sorenson , forfeited his salary for the NN and is donating hotel rooms to front - line workers to VB fight NNP - CD . Marriot RB asked its executives to sacrifice half of their salaries and has been furloughed JJ other employees . As a result , Marriot is still viewed – at least in the NN — as an employer of choice despite its need to furlough employees . Other NNS whose top leaders have cut their salaries include NBCUniversal , Uber , Delta , and Yelp . In my own field of academia , highly paid deans , coaches , and administrators at top universities IN Harvard are taking pay cuts to VB VB up for the impending deficits that higher education is facing . RB NN leaders , IN Jacinda Arden , NNP Zealand ’s prime minister , are taking pay cuts . Not all of us are CEOs who can VB the decision to keep NNS ’s paychecks coming or give up our salary for a NN . But there are still ways to sacrifice for our employees . Small gestures IN ordering lunch to be sent remotely to your employees for a NN zoom meeting can VB a JJ NN at maintaining the morale of the NN . If your organization has a leave donation program , you can donate some of your NN off to your NN members who need it . When you ’re a leader , sacrificing along with your employees MD mean that they will be more committed to staying with the NN during and after the NN . And , considering the cost of employee turnover , this MD mean the difference between recovering from the NNP - CD NN — or not . JJ organizations are offering free services IN free virtual tours or free learning tools for kids . Likewise , we have seen organizations step up to VB provide resources needed to combat the effects of the NN . Tesla , Toyota , Ford and GM have shut down factories to VB ventilators while Medtronic openly shared the software and specifications for their portable ventilators , allowing anyone to VB them for free to VB create ventilators in response to NNP - CD . But , whatever the give , it is important to tie the sacrifice to vision , mission , and the values of your organization so that NNS can understand why you are doing it . When Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff pledged not to do any layoffs for the next three months , he tied it to the cultural value of Ohana ( family ) and giving , asking that employees RB continue to support the NNS they relied on before the NN , such as NN cleaners or dog walkers . Leaders should be clear about how their actions are consistent with the organization ’s values . If that purpose is n’t clear , there can be backlash . Research shows that we are a skeptical bunch and when leaders self - sacrifice , we try to infer why the leader might be doing it or focus on what they are not doing ( IN whether or not the leaders are keeping their bonuses ) . The more cynical among us might infer that Johnson & Johnson ’s decision to invest a CD dollars to develop a NNP - CD NN was driven by profit . But , when CEO Alex Gorsky tied the act to their responsibility to improve the NN of NNS and they announced that they MD provide the NN on a not - for - profit basis , the doubt turns to admiration . In addition to explaining why they are making a sacrifice , leaders should be transparent about what that sacrifice amounts to . If a leader publicly donates 10 % of her salary to a nonprofit , she should explain what the nonprofit is and what exactly is happening to the NN . For example , Jack Dorsey is donating $ 1 CD of his Square equity ( 28 % of his wealth ) to fund NNP - CD relief . Not only is he giving away the NN ; he RB shared a NNP Doc showing how the funds MD be spent . Voluntary transparency becomes key in this situation . Disney ’s CEO Bob Chapek is forgoing 50 % of his salary and other benefits as a result of NNP - CD . But this decision came after pressure from the union for some information from leadership over concerns about the closing of Disney parks . RB when we are not in a NN , 84 % of employees VBP organizations are not doing enough to create transparency . But this comes at a cost to the organization . CD NN showed that organizations that were more transparent had higher productivity , innovation , and retention than those that were more opaque . In contrast , increasing transparency can in fact build trust . Crises create the opportunity for leaders to provide direction , meaning , and support when followers need it the most . Learning that Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle reduced his salary to $ 10,000 while continuing to pay its employees or that Yum Brands CEO , David Gibbs , gave up his salary and gave $ 1,000 bonuses to the managers of his restaurants does more than lift the spirits of their employees . These various strains of research indicate that this type of sacrifice can improve morale and trust for the rest of us , and ease the NN the rest of us are feeling in this NN ."

The poll VBD 67 % of NNS 60 and older VBP they ’d VB vaccinated , compared with 40 % who are younger . And death counts suggest black and Hispanic Americans are more vulnerable to NN - CD , because of unequal access to NN care and other factors . Yet the poll VBD just 25 % of African Americans and 37 % of Hispanics MD VB a NN compared to 56 % of whites . Among NNS who do n’t VB a NN , about 4 in 10 VBP they ’re concerned about catching NN - CD from the shot . But most of the leading NN candidates do n’t contain the NN itself , meaning they can’t VB infection . And 3 in 10 who do n’t VB a NN do n’t fear getting seriously ill from the NN . More than 5.5 CD NNS worldwide have been confirmed infected by the NN , and more than 340,000 deaths have been recorded , including nearly 100,000 in the U.S. , according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins NNP . Experts VBP the true toll is significantly higher . And while most NNS who VBP NNP - CD have mild NNS and recover , doctors still are discovering the NN attacks in far sneakier ways than just causing pneumonia – from NN clots to heart and kidney damage to the latest scare , a NN - threatening inflammatory reaction in NNS . Whatever the final statistics show about how often it kills , NN specialists agree the JJ NN appears deadlier than the typical NN . Yet the survey suggests a NN MD be no more popular than the yearly NN shot . Worldwide , about a dozen NN - CD NN candidates are in early stages of testing or poised to begin . British NNS are opening CD of the biggest studies so far , to test an Oxford NNP - created shot in 10,000 NNS . For all the promises of the NNP administration ’s Operation Warp Speed , only 20 % of Americans expect any NN to be available to the NN by NN ’s end , the poll VBD . Most VBP sometime next NN is more likely . Political divisions seen over how the NN reopens the NN are reflected in desire for a NN , too . More than half of Democrats call a NN necessary for reopening , compared with about a third of Republicans . While 62 % of Democrats MD VB the NN , only 43 % of Republicans VBP the same . “ There ’s still a JJ amount of uncertainty IN taking the NN , ” VBD Caitlin Oppenheimer , who leads NORC ’s JJ NN research . “ There is a lot of opportunity to communicate with Americans about the value and the safety of a NN . ” The AP - NORC poll of 1,056 adults was conducted NNP 14 - 18 using a sample drawn from NORC ’s probability - VBN AmeriSpeak Panel , which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population . The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points .

The quest to combat a deadly NN is exposing bottlenecks in the pharmaceutical supply chain . The NN has neither enough glass vials to VB the NN nor the facility capacity to fill and package them , experts VBP . "" The demand is VBG to far outstrip the supply , "" Vijay Kumar , an Evercore analyst who focuses on the JJ device and NN sciences sectors , told CNN Business in an interview . The NNP - CD NN has consistently shown what happens when supply chains are blindsided by spikes and drop - offs in demand and how an unexpected bottleneck can affect the integrity of the entire NN . The US is coming up short in acquiring "" basic but critical "" supplies to administer a NN NN , VBD Rick Bright , the JJ director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and NNP Authority , in his whistleblower complaint in NNP . He VBD that Strategic National Stockpile has only 2 % of the 650 CD to 850 CD needles and syringes needed and that officials are n't addressing the JJ shortage of glass vials . "" It MD take up to CD NNS to produce enough vials for US NN needs , while some therapeutics will RB require vials , "" Bright VBD , according to the complaint . Using the entire current inventory of vials for a NN - CD NN is n't reasonable because it MD create supply woes for ongoing needs such as the annual NN and kids ' vaccinations , Evercore 's Kumar VBD . The pharmaceutical industry started NNP - CD in a tight spot from a packaging perspective , as a JJ glass shortage was just starting to RB out , he VBD . JJ glass is n't made from your typical beach sand , and the vials are n't your everyday soda - lime glass VBN in JJ household items . "" Glass shortage stems from sand shortage : There are [ fewer than ] 1,000 sand mines in the US , "" Kumar and Evercore colleagues wrote in an April 26 research note . "" Desert sand is too smooth to VB for glass ; most [ quartz ] sand comes from rivers , and mining it can have ecological and infrastructure consequences . "" Pharmaceutical firms are exploring and devising workarounds that include packing a few doses into larger vials versus single - dose vials . The move saves on bottles , but it drastically raises the chances of the NN VBG to waste , VBD Prashant Yadav , a healthcare supply chain expert and senior fellow at the Center for NNP NNP . Multiple dose vials MD RB raise NN risks if they 're VBN improperly , notably via reuse of needles , VBD Jay Walker , VBD chief executive officer and chairman of ApiJect Systems , which makes pre-filled syringes . ApiJect , a JJ benefit corporation , has been CD of the NNS tapped in recent weeks to VB address potential supply chain challenges -- notably the vial shortage as well as the capacity constraints in filling and packaging the vials . The process is complex in nature , costly , and takes NN to build because it requires precision and regulatory scrutiny to ensure quality and safety . , out of an authorized total of in which sterile plastic containers are created , filled and sealed in a matter of seconds . ApiJect 's NN is expected to produce about 500 of the pre-filled syringes every minute . In March , ApiJect was awarded $ 10 CD by the US Department of NNP and NNP Servicesout of an authorized total of $ 456 CD , in addition to a more recent award of $ 138 CD from the US Department of Defense to research , develop and produce more than 100 CD of the pre-filled syringes by NN 's end . The syringes are made via a NN processin which sterile plastic containers are created , filled and sealed in a matter of seconds . ApiJect 's NN is expected to produce about 500 of the pre-filled syringes every minute . The product serves as an alternative to traditional glass vials for NN distribution . The NN will RB VB toward the retrofitting of existing NN facilities with a goal of producing more than 500 CD of the pre-filled syringes in 2021 . By 2022 , the goal is to have a production capacity of 330 CD finished units IN month , an HHS spokesperson told CNN Business . "" We 're part of the answer , but we 're not the whole answer , "" ApiJect 's Walker VBD . Update : This article has been updated to include how much NN from the federal award ApiJect has received ."

Over € 148 CD will be granted to another 36 NNS set to contribute to the recovery plan for Europe , for example by the NN of stronger and taller wind turbine towers made from wood modules . 28 NNP 2020 - NN JJ Response : “ JJ Goal : Unite For Our Future ” kick - off with support from NNP Citizen The NNP NNP Response was kick - started on 4 NNP and has so far raised € 9,8 CD for universal access to affordable NN NN , treatments and testing . On the launch of the next phase , NNP von der Leyen VBD : “ The NN needs to unit and defeat the NN once and for all . The good NN is that this is already happening . We are launch a JJ NN “ JJ Goal : Unite For Our Future ” and this idea comes from NNP Citizen . During the next month , NNS will VB their voices heard and contribute to our common fight against the NN . On 27 June , I will host a final pledging summit where businesses , foundations and citizens can join forces with JJ donors . ” 27 NNP 2020 - Europe ’s moment : major € 2,4 trillion Recovery Plan for Europe unveiled to repair and prepare for the next generation To kick - start the JJ recovery , protect lives , livelihoods and jobs , the NNP Commission is proposing a major € 2,4 trillion recovery plan which is VBN on using the full potential of a powerful , modern and revamped NNP budget to deliver a more sustainable , digital , inclusive and fair Europe . Commission NNP Ursula von der Leyen VBD : “ Europe ’s next generation will reap the benefits of tomorrow . These investments will not only preserve the outstanding achievements of the last 70 NNS , but will RB ensure that our Union is NN natural , digital , JJ and a strong JJ player in the future . This is about all of us . It is RB bigger than any of us . This is Europe 's moment . ” 12 NNP 2020 - € 117 CD granted for NN treatments and diagnostics The Commission selected 8 JJ - scale research projects aimed at developing treatments and diagnostics for the NN , in a fast - track call for proposals launched in March by the Innovative Medicines Initiative ( IMI ) , a JJ - private partnership . The Commission increased the Horizon 2020 initially - allocated funding of € 45 m to € 72 CD , while € 45 CD will be provided by the pharmaceutical industry , Innovative Medicines Initiative associated partners and other organisations , bringing the total investment to € 117 CD . The selected projects are part of the common JJ response to the NN outbreak that the Commission is coordinating since the beginning of the NN . By allocating funding from Horizon 2020 and partnering with the pharmaceutical industry , the Commission is able to fund a larger number of high - quality proposals and speed up the NN of NN diagnostics and treatments , essential tools necessary to tackle the JJ emergency . 11 NNP 2020 – JJ solidarity in action – rescEU masks delivered to NNP Macedonia and Montenegro Following previous deliveries to Italy , Spain and Croatia , additional batches of masks are being delivered to NNP Macedonia and Montenegro via rescEU – the common JJ reserve of JJ equipment to VB NNS affected by the NN outbreak . A JJ batch of 1,5 CD JJ masks was delivered to 17 Member NNPS and the UK to protect healthcare workers against NN on 8 NNP . Additional weekly instalments of 1,5 CD masks will RB be delivered over the coming six weeks via the Emergency Support Instrument . Romania and Germany , host the rescEU reserve and are therefore responsible for procuring the equipment , while the Commission finances 100 % of purchase of the masks and other equipment .

In addition to its contribution ahead of the NNP - Western Balkans ’ leaders meeting of 6 NNP 2020 , the Commission has broadly outlined longer - term support – an JJ and Investment Plan – to be presented in the autumn . NNP von der Leyen VBD : “ We have a special responsibility to assist in this NN our partners in the Western Balkans , as their future clearly lies in NNP Union . The NNP is mobilising a substantial JJ package , confirming the strong solidarity . Together we will overcome this NN and recover ” . 24 April 2020 – NNP Commission to VB a common recovery plan with a revamped NNP JJ - term budget at its heart JJ leaders tasked the NNP Commission with shaping a collective response to the NN following a videoconference on 23 April . A thorough JJ assessment will soon be under NN and the JJ budget , clearly linked to the Recovery Fund , is a NN - tested and a trusted instrument that can deliver the magnitude of tasks behind the recovery . The bulk of the investments will VB to creating investments and JJ cohesion , improving the Union ’s resilience and autonomy , all while furthering modern policies IN the NNP NNP Deal and the digital transition . Solid partnerships in the NNP ’s immediate neighbourhood must RB be strengthened . “ The next NNP JJ - term budget , our next seven - NN budget , has to adapt to the JJ circumstances , post - corona NN . We need to increase its firepower to be able to generate the necessary investment across the whole NNP Union , ” VBD NNP von der Leyen . This whole endeavour is about protecting the Single NN , investments should be front - loaded in the JJ NNS and it will be necessary to find the JJ balance between grants and loans . To swiftly support agricultural sector and food markets following the outbreak of the NN , the NNP Commission has proposed exceptional measures . The Commission proposes to grant private storage aid for dairy and meat NNS , flexibility in the implementation of NN support programmes to refocus funding priorities , and exceptional derogation from NNP competition rules to stabilise the markets in different sectors . For example , the milk sector will be allowed to collectively plan milk production and the flower and potatoes sector will be allowed to withdraw NNS from the NN . Such agreements and decisions MD only be valid for a period of maximum six months . Consumer price movements will be monitored closely to avoid adverse effects . The Commission aims to have these measures adopted by the end of April . 16 April – 2020 – NNP von der Leyen : “ The JJ budget will be the mothership of Europe ’s recovery ” Despite Europe ’s collective response being well above € 3 trillion – the most impressive response in the NN - more is needed , NNP von der Leyen VBD at the NNP Parliament . The NNP budget will be the mothership of Europe ’s recovery , driving the NN towards a more JJ and digital Europe . Investments in JJ - scale renovation , renewables , clean transport , sustainable food and nature restoration will be more important than before . Using every single euro available has meant investing in the procurement of JJ equipment , the NN of NNS , securing jobs and supporting business to jumpstart the NN . NNP von der Leyen concluded with a passionate plea for the NNP Union : “ If we all stand up for Europe today – with courage , trust and solidarity – I VBP that tomorrow Europe ’s soul will shine brighter than ever before . ” 14 April 2020 – € 2,7 CD from the NNP budget to support the healthcare sector To directly support healthcare systems in NNP NNS , the NNP Commission proposed to activate the NNP ’s Emergency Support Instrument – a measure that that Council quickly approved on 14 April . The € 2.7 CD Instrument will support the distribution of protective gear , the movement of patients to hospitals with free capacity , and to the NN of medication and testing methods . The instrument will be VBN together with other NNP tools , for example the rescEU JJ stockpile , which is receiving €300 CD in addition to the initially proposed allocation of € 80 CD , to support the distribution of JJ equipment across the NNP . It will RB be possible for individuals , foundations and Member NNPS to VB donations and crowd fund . The Commission proposed to postpone regulations on JJ devices by CD NN to allow manufacturers to focus on the production of critical JJ devices and avoiding shortages or delays potentially caused by regulatory bodies , thereby and saving lives . The Commission RB decided to temporarily lift customs duties and VAT on the import of JJ devices and protective equipment from third NNS . By making the import of masks , gloves , overalls and other protective equipment in some NNS by up to CD third cheaper , the decision will further increase the availability of these critical goods and VB those in need . Commission NNP Ursula von der Leyen , VBD : “ We are working on all fronts to remove the obstacles standing in our NN to ensure that our NN professionals VBP what they need to save lives . ” 02 April - NN response : Commission mobilises every euro to protect lives and livelihoods To quickly support workers and mitigate the unemployment risks that come with the NNP outbreak , the Commission launched a JJ initiative called SURE - Support mitigating Unemployment Risks in Emergency . To VB preserve jobs and support families , SURE will provide JJ assistance of up to € 100 CD to Member NNPS , in the form of loans granted on favourable terms . It RB proposed to redirect all available structural funds to the response to the NN . Farmers and fishermen will RB receive support , as will the most deprived of aid . An NNP Solidarity for NNP Initiative worth € 3 CD will cater for the needs of Member NNPS ’ NN systems . The profound impact of the NNP NN requires a response unprecedented in scale , speed and solidarity . With today ’s package , the Commission delivers just that ."

Doctors associate them with the common cold , bronchitis , pneumonia , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( NN ) , and NN NN 2019 ( NNP - CD ) . These viruses can RB affect the gut . Coronaviruses RB VBP the common cold , though they can be responsible for more severe illnesses . Over the past 80 NNS , NNS have VBN that these viruses can infect mice , rats , dogs , cats , turkeys , horses , pigs , and cattle . Sometimes , these NNS transmit the viruses to NNS . Most recently , authorities identified a JJ NN outbreak in China that has now reached other NNS . The NN is called severe acute respiratory syndrome NN 2 ( NNP - NN - 2 ) and it can VB NN - CD . In this article , we explain the different types of JJ NN , their NNS , and how NNS transmit them . We RB focus on three particularly dangerous NNS caused by coronaviruses : NNP - CD , NN , and Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) . Stay informed with live updates on the current NN - CD outbreak and visit our NN hub for more advice on prevention and NN . Covering the mouth when sneezing can VB stop the spread of coronaviruses . NNS RB identified a NN in 1937 , isolating CD that was responsible for a type of bronchitis in birds that had the potential to devastate poultry stocks . NNS VBD evidence of JJ coronaviruses in the 1960s , in the noses of NNS with the common cold . JJ coronaviruses that are particularly prevalent include 229E , NL63 , OC43 , and HKU1 . The name “ NN ” comes from the crown - JJ projections on their surfaces . “ Corona ” in Latin means “ halo ” or “ crown . ” Among NNS , NN infections most often occur during the winter months and early spring . In 2019 , the Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention ( CDC ) started monitoring the outbreak of a JJ NN , NNP - NNP - 2 , which causes NN - CD . Authorities RB identified the NN in Wuhan , China . Since then , the NN has spread to nearly every NN , leading the NNP NNP Organization ( WHO ) to declare a NN . The JJ NN has been responsible for millions of infections globally , causing hundreds of thousands of deaths . The NNP NNPS has seen the highest number of these deaths . The JJ NNS with NNP - CD had links to an NN and seafood NN . This suggests that NNS initially transmitted the NN to NNS . Then , NNS with no connections to the NN developed the NN , confirming that NNS can pass the NN to each other . Most NNS who VBP NN - CD will have a mild form of the NN . According to the WHO , RB 80 % of NNS who VBP NN - CD will recover without needing hospitalization . The remaining 20 % become seriously ill and develop difficulty breathing . Some groups are more at NN of severe NN , including older adults and NNS with underlying JJ concerns , including high NN pressure , heart and lung problems , diabetes , and cancer . The mortality rate varies between NNS . In the U.S. , the death rate is RB 6 % . According to the CDC , NNS are not at higher NN of NN - CD than adults . Pregnant NNS appear to have the same NN of NN - CD as other adults . However , during pregnancy , NNS have a higher NN of severe illness from viruses that are similar to NN - NN - 2 and influenza . The CDC RB recommend that infants born to NNS with suspected or confirmed NN - CD are put into isolation . According to the CDC , NNS MD start to experience NNS 2 – 14 days after exposure to the NN . NNS MD include : • JJ loss of taste or smell No NN is currently available for NNP - CD . However , NNS have now replicated the NN . This MD allow for early detection and NN in NNS who have the NN but are not experiencing NNS . According to the CDC , the following groups have a higher NN of developing serious illness from NN - CD : • NNS of any age who have serious underlying JJ conditions , including chronic lung NN , serious heart conditions , severe obesity , a compromised immune NN , or diabetes The CDC note that although there have been reports of complications in JJ NNS , these are rare . NNP - CD most commonly produces mild NNS in NNS . Cold - or NN - JJ NNS RB set in IN 2 – 4 days after the infection develops . Typically , the NNS are mild , though they vary from NN to NN . In some NNS , NN infections are fatal . While NNS can easily cultivate rhinoviruses — which RB VBP the common cold — in the laboratory , this is not the NN with coronaviruses . This makes it difficult to gauge the impact of these pathogens . There is currently no cure for the cold - JJ illnesses caused by coronaviruses . Treatments include self - care and over - the - counter medications . Taking the following steps MD VB : A NN can identify the NN responsible in a sample of fluid from a NN ’s NN , such as a sample of NN or mucus from the nose . Coronaviruses belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae . Different types of NN vary , in terms of the severity of NN that they VBP and how far they spread . Doctors currently recognize seven types of NN that can infect NNS . Rarer strains that VBP more severe illnesses include MERS - NNP , which causes the NN MERS , and NNP - NNP , the NN responsible for NN . In 2019 , a JJ strain , called NNP - NNP - 2 , started circulating , causing the NN NN - CD . The CDC recommend that all NNS wear cloth face masks in JJ places where it is difficult to maintain a 6 - NN ( 2 - meter ) distance from others . This will VB slow the spread of the NN from asymptomatic NNS and NNS who do not VB that they have contracted it . NNS should wear cloth face masks while continuing to practice physical distancing . Instructions for making masks at home are available here . Note : It is critical that surgical masks and N95 respirators are reserved for healthcare workers . NNS VBP that the viruses transmit via fluids in the respiratory NN , such as mucus . For example , a NN can spread when a NN : • coughs or sneezes without covering their mouth , dispersing droplets into the NN • touches someone who has the infection • touches a NN that has the NN , then touches their own nose , eyes , or mouth Some NN coronaviruses MD spread to NNS through contact with feces , though it is unclear whether JJ coronaviruses can spread in the same NN . Coronaviruses will infect most NNS at some point . To prevent transmission , NNS with NNS should stay at home , rest , and avoid coming into close contact with other NNS . Covering the mouth and nose with a tissue or handkerchief while coughing or sneezing can RB VB prevent transmission . It is important to dispose of VBN tissues RB away and maintain proper hygiene IN the home . MERS is caused by the MERS - NN NN . NNS RB recognized this severe respiratory illness in 2012 after it surfaced in Saudi Arabia . Since then , it has spread to other NNS . The NN has reached the U.S. However , only CD NNS in the NN have tested positive for MERS - NNP , and this was in 2014 . As a result , the CDC VBP that the NN of developing MERS in the U.S. is very low . NNS of MERS include a fever , breathlessness , and coughing . The illness spreads through close contact with NNS who have the infection . A 2019 investigation into MERS VBD that the NN is fatal in 35.2 % of NNS who develop it . Keep up to date on the current NN - CD outbreak . The CDC have RB a resource on reducing the NN of infection ."

The NN ’s prediction contrasts with testimony heard on Capitol Hill shortly before NNP spoke on the White NNP NNP Lawn . The ousted director of the federal NN ’s NN agency told lawmakers , “ We do n’t have a plan ” to mass - produce and distribute a NN NN . Hope for such a NN within 12 to 18 months assumes "" everything goes perfectly , ” Dr. Rick Bright testified . "" We 've never seen everything VB perfectly . ” More than 90 NNS for the novel NN are in NN IN the NN . German NN CureVac VBD Thursday that CD of its mRNA candidate NNS has protected NNS from the NN at low doses . JJ NNS are expected to begin next month . Bright was removed as the director of the Biomedical Advance Research and NNP Authority ( BARDA ) , which is under the Department of NNP and NNP Services , an action that prompted the immunologist to file a whistleblower complaint . NNP told reporters he watched some of Thursday ’s testimony by Bright and “ he looks IN an angry , disgruntled employee who , frankly , according to some NNS , did n't do a very good job . ” Bright told a NNP NN subcommittee that higher officials , including those at the White NNP , ignored his early warning about NNP - CD , and the federal NN was ill - prepared to respond to a NN . The current administration blames any shortcomings on plans and supplies left by the previous administration of Barack Obama , who turned the presidency over to NNP in January CD .

The NN , prior to visiting a JJ supply distributor in Pennsylvania , returned to his previous controversial promotion of an unproven malaria NN for NN of the novel NN . “ We ’ve had tremendous response to the hydroxy ( chloroquine ) , ” asserted NNP , who RB criticized Bright for “ fighting it ” when he was running BARDA . Bright and others cautioned about the need for scientific studies about using the NN for NN - CD NN and warned of its dangers , including the possibility it MD kill NNS . Asked by a reporter if the Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention is over - counting U.S. deaths from the NN , NNP replied , “ I do n't VB how they 're counting . I never discussed it with them . Death is death . We do n't VB NNS dying in this NN . And we 've done a great job . ” The NNP NNPS has recorded the most deaths and most NN - CD NNS of any NN . As of Thursday afternoon EDT , according to records compiled by Johns Hopkins NNP , 1.4 CD NNS had tested positive for the NN and more than 85,000 had died in the NN . At a Thursday afternoon event , partly resembling a NN rally , at a JJ supply distribution NN in the NN battleground NN of Pennsylvania , the NN promoted the replenishment of the strategic national stockpile . NNP linked the high rate of NN - CD NNS in the NNP NNPS to the NN 's having conducted the most tests . “ When you test , you have a NN , ” the NN VBD . “ If we did n’t do any testing , we MD have very few NNS . ”"

It still remains a significant NN of death worldwide , despite the availability of a safe , effective NN . There were about 110,000 JJ deaths related to NNS in CD , most of them in NNS under the age of 5 , according to the . NN NNS have RB been increasing in the NNP NNPS in recent NNS . Learn more about the NNS of NNS , how it spreads , and how it can be prevented . NN is caused by infection with a NN from the paramyxovirus family . Viruses are tiny parasitic microbes . Once you ’ve been infected , the NN invades host NNS and uses cellular components to complete its NN cycle . The NNS NN infects the respiratory tract RB . However , it eventually spreads to other parts of the NN through the bloodstream . NN is only VBN to occur in NNS and not in other NNS . There are VBN genetic types of NNS , although only 6 are currently circulating . NNS can be spread through the NN from respiratory droplets and small aerosol particles . An infected NN can release the NN into the NN when they cough or sneeze . These respiratory particles can RB settle on objects and surfaces . You can become infected if you come into contact with a contaminated object , such as a door handle , and then touch your face , nose , or mouth . The NNS NN can live outside of the NN for longer than you MD VB . In fact , it can remain infectious in the NN or on surfaces for up to . NN is highly contagious . This means that the infection can spread very easily from NN to NN . A susceptible NN that ’s exposed to the NN NN has a 90 percent chance of becoming infected . Additionally , an infected NN can VB on to spread the NN to anywhere between 9 and 18 susceptible individuals . A NN that has NNS can spread the NN to others before they RB VBP that they have it . An infected NN is contagious for four days before the characteristic rash appears . After the rash appears , they ’re still contagious for another four days . The main NN factor for catching NN is being unvaccinated . Additionally , some groups are at a higher NN of developing complications from NN infection , including JJ NNS , NNS with a weakened immune NN , and pregnant NNS . If you suspect that you have NNS or have been exposed to someone with NNS , contact your NN immediately . They can evaluate you and direct you where to be seen to determine if you have the infection . Doctors can confirm NNS by examining your NN rash and checking for NNS that are characteristic of the NN , such as white spots in the mouth , fever , cough , and sore throat . If they suspect you MD have NNS VBN on your history and observation , your NN will order a NN test to check for the NNS NN . There ’s no specific NN for NNS . Unlike bacterial infections , viral infections are n’t sensitive to antibiotics . The NN and NNS typically disappear in about CD or three weeks . There are some interventions available for NNS who MD have been exposed to the NN . These can VB prevent an infection or lessen its severity . They include : • a NN NN , given within 72 hours of exposure • a dose of immune proteins called immunoglobulin , taken within six days of exposure Your NN MD recommend the following to VB you recover : • rest to VB boost your immune NN Although it ’s often associated with childhood illness , adults can VB NNS too . NNS who are n’t vaccinated are at a higher NN of catching the NN . It ’s generally accepted that adults born during or before 1957 are naturally immune to NNS . This is because the NN was RB licensed in 1963 . Before then , most NNS had been naturally exposed to the infection by their adolescent NNS and became immune as a result . According to the , serious complications are not only more common in JJ NNS , but RB in adults over the age of 20 . These complications can include things IN pneumonia , encephalitis , and blindness . If you ’re an adult who has n’t been vaccinated or is n’t sure of their NN status , you should VB your NN to receive the NN . At least CD dose of the NN is recommended for unvaccinated adults . The NNS NN is n’t given to NNS until they ’re at least 12 months JJ . Before receiving their JJ dose of the NN is the NN they ’re most vulnerable to being infected with the NN NN . Babies receive some protection from NNS through passive immunity , which is provided from mother to child through the placenta and during breastfeeding . However , has shown that this immunity can be lost in just over 2.5 months after birth or the NN breastfeeding is discontinued . NNS under 5 NNS of age are more likely to have complications due to NNS . These can include things IN pneumonia , encephalitis , and ear infections that can result in hearing loss . The incubation period of an infectious NN is the NN that passes between exposure and when NNS develop . The incubation period for NNS is between 10 and 14 days . After the initial incubation period , you MD begin to experience nonspecific NNS , such as fever , cough , and runny nose . The rash will begin to develop several days later . It ’s important to remember that you can still spread the infection to others for four days prior to developing the rash . If you VBP you ’ve been exposed to NNS and have n’t been vaccinated , you should contact your NN as soon as possible . In addition to a classic NN infection , there are RB several other types of NNS infections that you can VB . Atypical NNS occurs in NNS who received a killed NN NN between 1963 and 1967 . When exposed to NNS , these individuals come down with an illness that has NNS such as high fever , rash , and sometimes pneumonia . Modified NNS occurs in NNS who ’ve been given post - exposure immunoglobulin and in infants who still have some passive immunity . Modified NNS is typically milder than a regular NN of NNS . Hemorrhagic NNS is rarely reported in the NNP NNPS . It causes NNS IN high fever , seizures , and bleeding into the NN and mucus membranes . You MD have heard rubella referred to as “ German NNS . ” But NNS and rubella are actually caused by CD different viruses . Rubella is n’t as contagious as NNS . However , it can VB serious complications if a woman develops the infection while pregnant . RB though different viruses VBP NNS and rubella , they ’re RB similar in several ways . Both viruses : • can be spread through the NN from coughing and sneezing Both NNS and rubella are included in the NN - mumps - rubella ( MMR ) and NN - mumps - rubella - varicella ( MMRV ) NNS . There a few ways to prevent becoming ill with NNS . Getting vaccinated is the best NN to prevent NNS . CD doses of the NN NN are effective at preventing NNS infection . There are CD NNS available — the MMR NN and the MMRV NN . The MMR NN is a three - in - CD NN that can protect you from NNS , mumps , and rubella . The MMRV NN protects against the same infections as the MMR NN and RB includes protection against chickenpox . NNS can receive their JJ NN at 12 months , or sooner if traveling internationally , and their second dose between the ages of 4 and 6 . Adults who have never received an immunization can request the NN from their NN . Some groups should n’t receive a NN against NNS . These groups include : • NNS who ’ve had a previous NN - threatening reaction to the NNS NN or its components • immunocompromised individuals , which can include NNS with HIV or AIDS , NNS undergoing cancer NN , or NNS on medications that suppress the immune NN Side effects to NN are typically mild and disappear in a few days . They can include things IN fever and mild rash . In rare NNS , the NN has been linked to low platelet count or seizures . Most NNS and adults who receive a NN NN do n’t experience side effects . Some VBP that the NNS NN can VB NN in NNS . As a result , an intense amount of NN has been devoted to this topic over JJ NNS . This research has VBN that there is between NNS and NN . NN is n’t just important for protecting you and your family . It ’s RB important for protecting NNS who ca n’t be vaccinated . When more NNS are vaccinated against a NN , it ’s less likely to circulate within the population . This is called herd immunity . To achieve herd immunity against NNS , approximately of the population must be vaccinated . Not everyone can receive the NNS NN . But there are other ways that you can VB to prevent the spread of NNS . • Practice good hand hygiene . Wash your hands before eating , after using the bathroom , and before touching your face , mouth , or nose . • Do n’t share personal items with NNS who MD be ill . This can include things IN eating utensils , drinking glasses , and toothbrushes . • Avoid coming into contact with NNS who are sick • Stay home from work or school and other JJ places until you are n’t contagious . This is four days after you RB develop the NN rash . • Avoid contact with NNS who MD be vulnerable to infection , such as infants too JJ to be vaccinated and immunocompromised NNS . • Cover your nose and mouth if you need to cough or sneeze . Dispose of all VBN tissues promptly . If you do n’t have a tissue available , sneeze into the crook of your elbow , not into your hand . • Be sure to wash your hands frequently and to disinfect any surfaces or objects that you touch frequently . Pregnant NNS who do n’t have immunity to NNS should take care to avoid exposure during their pregnancy . Coming down with NNS during your pregnancy can have significant negative NN effects on both the mother and fetus . Pregnant NNS are at an increased NN for complications from NNS such as pneumonia . Additionally , having NNS while pregnant can lead to the following pregnancy complications : NNS can RB be transmitted from mother to child if the mother has NNS close to her delivery date . This is called congenital NNS . Babies with congenital NNS have a rash after birth or develop CD shortly afterward . They ’re at an increased NN of complications , which can be NN - threatening . If you ’re pregnant , do n’t have immunity to NNS , and VB that you ’ve been exposed , you should contact your NN immediately . Receiving an injection of immunoglobulin MD VB to prevent an infection . NN has a low death rate in healthy NNS and adults , and most NNS who contract the NN NN recover fully . The NN of complications is higher in the following groups : Approximately of NNS with NNS experience CD or more complications . NN can lead to NN - threatening complications , such as pneumonia and inflammation of the brain ( encephalitis ) . Other complications associated with NNS MD include : • pregnancy complications , such as miscarriage or preterm labor • subacute sclerosing panencephalitis ( SSPE ) , a rare degenerative condition of the nervous NN that develops NNS after infection You ca n’t VB NNS more than once . After you ’ve had the NN , you ’re immune for NN . However , NNS and its potential complications are preventable through NN . NN not only protects you and your family , but RB prevents the NN NN from circulating in your community and affecting those who ca n’t be vaccinated ."

"" The article is the latest criticism of a NN that has been widely discredited . But if NNS are off the table , what does VB NN ? While NNS are still investigating the issue , they VBP the disorder likely has a number of causes involving both our genes and our environment , or some combination of the CD . For instance , NNS MD have underlying genetic susceptibilities to NN that are triggered by something they encounter in the environment . Making things RB more complicated is the fact that NN , which is characterized by problems interacting and communicating with others , is not a single disorder , but a range of disorders that MD have various causes . [ VB a timeline of events : NNS and NNP : How the NNP Unfolded ] "" NNS are VBG to manifest the disorder in different ways , and that MD be because there are different sets of genes , [ or ] different sets of JJ factors , "" that contribute to how the disorder presents itself , VBD Alycia Halladay , director of research for JJ sciences for NNP Speaks , an NN advocacy organization that funds NN research . Here are the latest findings and ideas from NNS about what might RB VB this mysterious condition . There is strong evidence that changes in our genes contribute to NN . For CD thing , the disorder is highly heritable . Families that have CD child with NN have a 1 in 20 chance of having a second child with NN , according to the National Institutes of NNP . This is a higher NN than in the general population . And twin studies have VBN that if CD twin has NN , the other twin as a 90 percent chance of having the disorder . Research has RB shown that the genetic changes that contribute to NN do n't have to be inherited — they MD RB arise spontaneously . In total , NNS have identified about 20 genes that MD be involved in NN spectrum disorder , Halladay VBD . While these genes are located all over the JJ genome , they share a common theme , she VBD . JJ have a role in brain NN , brain growth and the NN brain NNS communicate . For example , a recent NN VBD that NNS with a genetic mutation on chromosome 17 were 14 times more likely to develop NN than those without the mutation . Exposure to pesticides has RB been linked to NN . Some studies have VBN that pesticides MD interfere with genes involved in the central nervous NN , VBD Dr. Alice Mao , a professor of psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston . NNS VBP that chemicals in pesticides MD adversely affect those who are genetically predisposed to NN , leading them to develop the full - blown disorder , Mao VBD . "" Maybe they were born with a vulnerability to NN , but then exposure to the pesticides might have VB the presentation of NN , "" Mao told MyHealthNewsDaily . Babies that have been exposed to certain pharmaceuticals in the womb , including valproic acid and thalidomide , have been VBN to have a higher NN of NN . Thalidomide is a NN that was RB VBN in the 1950s to treat morning sickness , anxiety and insomnia . The NN was withdrawn from the NN after it was linked with birth defects , but is currently prescribed for a severe NN disorder and as a NN for cancer . Valproic acid is a medication prescribed for seizures , mood disorders and bipolar disorder , according to the NIH . As NNS grow older , they have a higher NN of having NNS with NN , Halladay VBD . A NN published last February VBD that NNS who are 40 NNS JJ have a 50 percent greater NN of having a child with NN than NNS who are between 20 and 29 NNS JJ . NNS are n't sure why parental age MD influence NN NN , but it might be related to genetic mutations that occur in the sperm or the egg as NNS grow older , Halladay VBD . The NN of the brain Particular areas of the brain , including the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum , have been implicated in NN , Mao VBD . These brain areas are thought to be responsible for concentration , movement and mood regulation . Irregularities in the levels of neurotransmitters , such as dopamine and serotonin , have RB been tied to NN , Mao VBD . Problems regulating dopamine can lead to problems with concentration and movement disabilities , while troubles controlling serotonin levels can result in mood problems . While NNS cannot VB definitively what causes NN , they have come a JJ NN in the last decade , Halladay VBD . For example , NNS originally thought there might be just a single gene or a few JJ factors that are linked to NN , but now evidence has shown there are likely to be more . "" I VBP our knowledge has increased , and the NN that we VBP about looking for potential genes and JJ candidates has improved , "" Halladay VBD . "" We 're thinking about a JJ NN — it 's not just VBG to be just CD gene or CD JJ factor , it 's more complex than that , "" she VBD . Pass it on : NN likely has a number of causes , both genetic and JJ . • NNS and NN Timeline : How the NNP Unfolded • 1998 NN Linking NNP to NNPS Was an ' Elaborate Fraud '"

You 'll RB find yourself dealing with an emerging personality and increasing conflicts . Your NN will VB your child four times for routine well visits during this period , at 12 , 15 , 18 , and 24 months . If your toddler has missed any immunizations , or if a problem has been detected that needs special attention , additional visits MD be scheduled . What to Expect During the Office Visit The well - child checkups during your child 's second NN are similar to those before , but discussions with your NN about behavior and habits MD become more detailed as your toddler gets older . • Measurement of your child 's length , weight , and head circumference . Growth will be plotted on the growth chart , and you 'll be advised of your toddler 's progress . • A review of your toddler 's NN through both observation and your progress report . Is your tot starting to walk ? Scribbling ? Following simple instructions ? Saying a few words ? Combining CD words by age 2 ? The NN MD ask you these questions and others IN them . • The NN MD VB over safety questions such as : Have you childproofed your home ? ( You 'll need to review your babyproofing efforts now that your toddler can stand and reach . ) Is your tot in an appropriate safety seat while riding in the car ? • A discussion of your child 's eating habits . Is he or she eating a variety of foods ? Finger feeding or using a spoon ? Using a cup ? Being weaned from the breast or bottle ? Most doctors advise a switch from bottle to cup between 12 and 18 months . • Advice on what to expect in the coming months . If they have n't already , kids this age might undergo a tuberculin NN test , especially those at NN for tuberculosis . You 'll be given instructions on how to monitor the test and report results to the NN 's office . Your NN MD recommend a NN test to check for anemia and lead poisoning . Address any questions or concerns you have , and write down any specific instructions the NN gives you regarding special care . Keep updating your child 's permanent JJ record , listing information on growth and any problems or illnesses . A child who did not have them at the 12 - month visit will VB these NNS at 15 months : • the third or fourth Hib NN , depending on the manufacturer At the 18 - month visit , if not already been given , NNS should VB : • third hepatitis B NN ( HBV ) , which can be given starting at 6 months • third inactivated poliovirus NN ( IPV ) , which can be given starting at 6 months Your child MD RB VB a NN shot , which is recommended every NN before NN NN for NNS older than 6 months . If your child is at high NN for developing meningococcal NN , a serious infection that can lead to bacterial meningitis , your NN MD offer the meningococcal NN as well . Discuss possible NN reactions with your NN and VB advice on when to call with problems . At the 18 - month visit , toddlers undergo a screening test to VB identify developmental delays and NN . There is a wide range of normal when it comes to reaching developmental milestones . But by 18 months , most toddlers : • walk on their own By age 2 , toddlers should be able to : • put CD words together to form a sentence Talk to your NN if you have concerns about your child 's NN . When Should I Call the NN ? By now you have probably called your NN 's office JJ times with questions and concerns about your child 's NN . Do n't hesitate to notify the NN if you VBP that something is wrong — you VBP your child best . And always call the NN if your child has a fever , is acting sick , has serious problems sleeping , is refusing all food or drink , is vomiting , or has diarrhea ."

"" What You Are n’t Being Told About The NN You Live In How The “ NN NN ” Label Was Conceived To Derail The NN Movement How Covert JJ Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate , Deceive , and Destroy Reputations Hillary NNP “ Total Terror ” Descends Upon Disabled Mother Who Discovered Her Link To By : Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Western Subscribers A heartbreaking Foreign Intelligence Service ( SVR ) report circulating in the Kremlin today details the “ total terror ” Hillary NNP and her Obama regime allies have unleashed upon a disabled JJ mother of an autistic son who had “ inadvertently / mistakenly ” discovered an “ electronic document ” ( email ? photocopy ? ) written by the JJ Secretary of NNP authorizing a massive weapons shipment from , , to Islamic NNP ( ISIS / ISIL / Daesh ) terrorists in . [ Note : Some words and / or phrases appearing in quotes are English language approximations of Russian words / phrases having no exact counterpart . ] According to this report , earlier this spring the General Directorate of the General Staff ( GRU ) reported that they obtained a “ treasure trove ” of secret Islamic NN documents from a Syrian village that had been retaking by Kurdish forces . Among these documents ( now classified at the highest security level ) obtained by the GRU , this report continues , were detailed arrangements between the Islamic NNP terrorists and the US Department of NNP on the transferring of weapons and other NN materials to Syria from Libya in exchange for payment at the Turkish - Syrian border of NN stolen from by these terrorists from both Syria and Iraq . Upon the SVR ’s examination of these Islamic NNP documents , as was requested by the GRU , this report continues , it was discovered that these terrorists had “ electronically sent ” ( NNP ) a number of them to their JJ supporters via JJ JJ NN as proof that they were being supported by the NNP NNPS . With Wikileaks having confirmed the validity of these documents proving Hillary NNP armed these Islamic NNP terrorists , and US Senator Rand Paul , likewise , publically stating that she had shipped weapons to ISIS terror forces in Syria from Benghazi , and then lied about it , this report notes , none of NNP ’s mainstream propaganda press organs have yet to tell the JJ NNS of these horrific facts . With the “ vacuum of NN ” relating to Hillary NNP ’s grave crimes being created by NNP ’s mainstream press , this report continues , it has been left to that nations independent journalists to keep the true facts flowing — and whom the Obama regime , and its propaganda press supporters , now label as “ NN theorists ” . So terrified , in fact , has Hillary NNP and the Obama regime become of these independent journalists they now call “ NN theorists ” , this report documents , top Obama official Cass Sunstein co-authored , in 2008 , a report titled NN NNS : Causes and Cures telling both Obama and Hillary NNP how to move against them — and that the secret US intelligence documents released by Edward Snowden proved was being implemented by covert JJ agents who had infiltrated the internet to manipulate , deceive and destroy the reputations of all dissidents considered as enemies . To those independent journalists who MD n’t be stopped by having Obama and Hillary NNP destroy their reputations , this report continues , they turned to methods of “ total terror ” — such as is currently being VBN against a disabled 38 - NN - JJ mother of CD named Safya Roe Yassin , CD of whose NNS is autistic . Ms Yassin , this report explains is an JJ citizen born in the NNP NNPS , who has never left her NN , considers herself as an independent journalist , has never met a Muslim NN , but was charged by the Obama regime with the grave crime of supporting ISIS — she is n’t accused of plotting a domestic attack or trying to travel overseas to join the terrorist group . she simply reported the NN . What made Ms Yassin terrifying to Hillary NNP , however , this report VBZ , was that she was investigating ISIS and resending to her “ readers / followers ” copies of “ electronic documents ” ( Tweets ) proving NNP ’s US NNP Department was funneling weapons to these terrorists from Libya . This report notes that from US NN reports Ms Yassin has been a longtime independent journalist investigator examining various controversial issues such as chemtrials , genetically modified foods , the dangers of NNS as they pertain to NN , and was a frequent reader of longtime “ NN NN ” reporters Alex Jones and David Icke . Living as a shut - in with her father and CD NNS in Buffalo , Missouri , this report continues , Ms Yassin rarely left home because she is severely disabled from a spinal injury and depends upon a catheter ( inserted JJ device for releasing urine from the bladder ) in her daily NN — but whom when she began re-Tweeting ISIS documents showing Hillary NNP ’s crimes in arming them , was put under daily surveillance by the NNP with them charging her , on 11 January , and her NN scheduled to start on CD September . SVR analysts contributing to this report VBP that Mr Yassin ’s “ motive / reason ” for investigating Hillary NNP ’s links with ISIS related to her Christian belief that the “ end times ” might be near — and that was explained by Audrey Alexander , a researcher at George Washington NNP ’s Program on Extremism , who noted that her postings might be confusing to other ISIS supporters due to her originality : “ She is questioning whether ISIL is the end of times army . That ’s something that a lot of the community does n’t necessarily latch onto , which is why we VBP her views are quite well informed . ” Though Ms Yassin ’s aunt , Sandra Mick , told authorities “ The real story is , she ’s not a terrorist . She retweeted and reposted what other NNS had posted , that ’s the story . She ’s never been outside this NN . I doubt she ’s RB met a real Muslim ” , her cousin , Janice Valenti , asserting that she is a Christian who teaches her CD NNS NNP verses , and the US Federal Judge at her bail hearing stating “ when it comes down to it , she is a disabled woman who poses no physical threat [ to ] herself and to anyone else ” , this report sadly notes , Obama - NNP forces have been able to keep her jailed and separated from her JJ NNS , and RB worse , have still refused to turn over to her defense attorneys the evidence they claim to have against her . To the fullest horror , however , of what Hillary NNP has planned for Ms Yassin , this report VBZ , is the Obama regime planning to silence her under what is called Classified Information Procedures Act ( CIPA ) that will deny her the ability to VB any evidence against her , her attorneys not allowed to offer any defense of any kind , and is an exact duplicate of the Show NNS VBN to silence dissidents in the JJ Soviet Union . Statement of Jeffrey Melhorn about his neighbor Safya Roe Yassin To how the JJ NNS themselves are reacting to this disabled JJ mothers torture by Hillary NNP , this report continues , cannot be VBN as the Obama regime supported press still remains silent about this NN that puts all of these peoples lives in jeopardy — as now any of them who re-Tweets , or in other NN , forwards information the US considers subversive can now be jailed for the rest of their lives . As to what Hillary NNP is most fearful about , this report VBZ , is the JJ NNS discovering the tens - of - millions of dollars she has been given by Saudi Arabia and the Gulf NNPS , the over $ 165 CD in arms she gave them too while Secretary of NNP , as the Wikileaks Cablegate NNS prove , and all for the single purpose of destroying Syria and Iraq in order for these Arab NNS to build natural NN pipelines across in order to achieve the ultimate goal of destroying both NNP and China . To the only hope Ms Yassin , or for that matter the JJ NNS , has , this report concludes , is Donald NNP — who this past week became the highest positioned figure in the US to join with the independent journalists truthfully telling these NNS that Obama - NNP are , indeed , the founders of ISIS , and who , RB , by the most accurate , and honest , accounting made yet of the upcoming presidential NN , is showed to be winning by a landslide .

NNS at Greffex Inc , which has a corporate headquarters in Houston and a laboratory in Aurora , Colorado , VBP they finished developing the NN this week . Read our NN live blog for all the latest NN and updates However , it MD still be CD NNS before the NN is available to VB . It now needs to be tested in NN experiments before JJ NNS can begin . The NN comes as the death toll hit 2,247 , and NNS of the NN reached 76,727 across the NN . Greffex 's NN NN and CEO John Price told the Houston Business Journal that they did not VB a living or killed NN to form the NN - for safety reasons . The NN is so poorly understood , has spread so quickly and has killed enough NNS that NNS at Greffex did not VB to VB exposure that MD trigger the deadly illness VBN as NNP - CD . Instead , adenovirus - VBN vector NNS , which are widely employed against various infectious NNS or cancers , were VBN . Adenoviruses are among the most common causes of viral respiratory infections , accounting for between CD and five NN cent of colds . "" The trick in making a NN is can you scale the NN that you ’ve made to be able to VB a certain number of doses , can you test that NN quickly and efficiently and then can you VB it into patients , "" Price told local outlet KHOU 11 . "" And that ’s where we have an edge as well on the other NNS that are out there . ” The NN is the product of an $ 18.9 CD ( £ 14.64 CD ) contract Greffex received in September 2019 from the National Institute of NNP ’s National Institute for Allergy and Infectious NNPS , aimed at fighting infectious threats , the Business Journal reported . NN is an airborne NN , spread in a similar NN to colds and the NN . NNS include a runny nose , headache , cough and fever , shortness of breath , chills and NN aches . It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the NN is on as well as infected breath , coughs or sneezes . In most NNS , you wo n't VB whether you have a NN or a different cold - causing NN , such as rhinovirus . But if a NN infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract ( your windpipe and your lungs ) , it can VB pneumonia , especially in older NNS , NNS with heart NN or NNS with weakened immune systems . There is no NN currently available for NN . In 2003 an outbreak of a similar NN , NNP , infected more than 8,000 NNS in 37 NNS before it was brought under NN , killing 800 of those worldwide . If the NN wins NN approval in the US , Greffex will give it away for free to the hardest - hit NNS , Price VBD . More than 2,100 NNS have died as a result of the NN - CD outbreak , with all but 11 of those deaths in mainland China . Worldwide , more than 75,700 NNS have been infected . In England , a total of nine NNS have tested positive for the NN , while more than 5,000 have tested negative . The NHS confirmed that all but CD of them have been discharged from hospital . Yesterday , it was revealed that the UK high street MD be hit with shortages of stock due to the deadly NN . NNS including Asos , B&M and Primark rely heavily on supply from China , where JJ numbers of factories have been shut down amid the NNP - CD outbreak ."

The NN and stories that matter , delivered weekday mornings . It ’s getting ugly out there on JJ NN . Anti-vaccine activists are attacking pediatricians head to head on NNP , NNP and other JJ NN platforms , and they ’re not hesitating to VB their attacks personal . A few fed - up doctors are fighting back , both RB and , more recently , in the courts . CD pediatrician , Dr. Eve Switzer of Enid , Oklahoma , filed a defamation suit last NN against JJ Oklahoma ophthalmologist Jim Meehan and Oklahomans for NNP and NNP Choice , saying they publicly and falsely accused her of failing to provide informed consent to NNS about vaccinations . “ Anti-vaxxers have gotten out of NN , ” Switzer told NBC NNP . “ As a pediatrician , the NN that it has affected me personally , my practice and my staff , RB , I RB felt IN I needed to have some sort of remedy and my only remedy was a legal remedy . ” It 's difficult enough to counter the continual questions raised by NN skeptics and activists who , increasingly , VBP all NNS are unsafe for all NNS . Worries about NN , a preservative called thimerosal , the spacing of NNS , NN ingredients and whether kids VBP too JJ NNS have all been repeatedly and thoroughly addressed , but that does n’t stop NNS of JJ NN from bringing them up again and again . “ VBG up against the anti-vaccine movement is a thankless task for a number of reasons . For CD , the goalpost is moving , ” VBD Dr. Peter Hotez , director of the Texas NNP 's Hospital Center for NNP NNP and dean of the school of tropical medicine at Baylor College of Medicine . “ So if you can explain why MMR ( NNS , mumps and rubella ) NN does n’t VB NN , they ’ll turn RB and VB well it must be thimerosal in NNS . If you debunk this , then they ’ll VB ‘ well we are spacing NNS too close together ’ and if you debunk that and then it ’s aluminum in NNS , ” he added . Using JJ NN takes it to a JJ level . Just as JJ NNS allow NNS to stay in their own political echo chambers , viewing and sharing only their own beliefs , NN of JJ NN is allowing NN skeptics to harden their messages . NNP feeds offer continual validation with NN after NN of NNS who VBP they VBP NNS gave their NNS eczema or asthma or RB killed their babies — claims made with no JJ backing . And on NNP , any post about the benefits of NNS — all supported by decades of NN — is often immediately attacked . Most recently , a Detroit - area mother jailed for a week for refusing to follow a NN order that involved vaccinating her kids got an instant support group . Although the judge in the NN , Circuit NNP Judge Karen McDonald , made it clear the sentence was about disregarding a NN order that Bredow had initially agreed to , Bredow herself and anti-vaccine groups framed it as having taken a stand for her beliefs . In reality , there is no legitimate debate about the safety or benefits of NNS . While no JJ group claims NNS are 100 percent safe , the Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention , National Institutes of NNP , and dozens of academic NNS independent of the federal NN have shown the benefits of NNS both to individual NNS and adults and to the population at JJ . “ Childhood NN saves up to 3 CD lives every NN , but 1.5 CD NNS still die each NN from NNS that MD have been prevented by NNS , ” the nonprofit Sabin NNP Institute VBZ . But you might not VB that if you take a look at JJ NN . “ It ’s more systematic and more aggressive and more effective , ” VBD Hotez , who is RB a pediatrician , the parent of a JJ woman with NN , and a vocal advocate for NN . “ There ’s a JJ element to the anti-vaccine group that has sort of an alt - JJ flavor to it . ” Theodore Tomeny of the psychology department of the NNP of Alabama and colleagues tracked NNP activity and VBD more than 270,000 tweets containing anti-vaccine statements between 2009 and CD — half of all the tweets they VBD about NNS in general . California , Connecticut , Massachusetts , NNP York and Pennsylvania were particularly rich in anti-vaccine NNP NNS . “ We VBD that anti-vaccine sentiment seems to be prevalent on NNP , ” Tomeny VBD . “ It RB seems to cluster geographically . We observed spikes over NN that seemed to be associated with current events IN CD of the recent NNS outbreaks in California . ” They not only repeat untrue rumors about NNS , but accuse NN and academic doctors of colluding with pharmaceutical NNS to cover up the dangers of NNS , without real evidence to back up these accusations . Pediatricians , JJ NN experts and others MD do well to monitor this type of JJ NN NN and counter its influence , Tomeny and colleagues wrote in the October issue of the journal NNP NNP & Medicine . The instinct for some MD be to just turn them off . “ Thank NNP for the mute and block function , ” Hotez VBD . But Hotez VBZ it ’s RB important to counter some of the more viral wrong stuff . Related : Detroit Mom Jailed , But Was it RB About NNS ? “ I VBP it ’s very important to VB the facts out there . So I have put a lot of effort into explaining why NNS do n’t VB NN , ” he VBD . “ The argument that NNS is not dangerous — I VBP that is important to refute . The allegation that I am making millions of dollars off my NN — I VBP it ’s important to refute that . ” Texas NNP 's took over work from the Sabin NNP Institute to develop NNS to prevent parasitic NNS such as hookworm and schistosomiasis . “ They do n’t seem to understand that these are NNS for the NN ’s poorest NNS that will never VB any NN , ” Hotez VBD . It ’s not difficult to find personal attacks against Hotez on the internet , including blogs that outright call him a liar . Dr. Paul Offit of NNP ’s Hospital of Philadelphia is a veteran of such personal attacks that RB extended to threats against his kids . But with universal access to JJ NN giving a platform to anyone with a smartphone , any pediatrician who is vocal about the anti-vaccine movement , or who RB posts something JJ about the benefits of NNS , can be targeted . Tomeny VBD it MD be the impersonal aspect of JJ NN . “ Perhaps it ’s the fact that it is not face - to - face communication , ” he VBD . “ You are not having to view the other NN ’s reactions and temper your statements VBN on it . ” Switzer has VBN that to be the NN . While she finds it easy to answer polite questions from NNS in her office , she ’s had a different experience RB . “ Most of what I VBP that ’s confrontational is on JJ NN , ” she VBD . “ This is a group of NNS who when I VBP anti-vaxxers , these are the NNS I am talking about — the NNS who are confrontational . They adamantly VBP that NNS are n’t safe or effective . They RB prefer to perpetuate myths about them , things that NN just does n’t support . ” JJ NNS who MD not be familiar with the JJ evidence MD hear some of these claims and wonder if they are true . “ Sometimes all it takes is implanting that teeny little bit of doubt into a parent , ” Switzer VBD . “ So if we ignore these anti-vaccine NNS with all of the nonsense that they are putting on JJ NN , I RB feel IN that it gives them a greater voice . I VBP more pediatricians should be involved in putting stuff out on JJ NN to counter the misleading and just blatantly JJ information that they VBP . ” So Switzer is not only taking the NN NN . She ’s RB suing , and another group of pediatricians VBP they have filed a formal complaint again Meehan with the Oklahoma NNP Board of NNP Licensure . “ We , the undersigned , wish to file a formal complaint against James C. Meehan , MD , for his unprofessional behavior on JJ NN directed at each of us , ” the complaint reads . It 's signed by eight physicians and JJ students , including Dr. Christopher Johnson , a pediatric critical care specialist in Santa Fe who lists a torrent of abusive tweets from Meehan in the complaint , as well as Dr. Alastair McAlpine of Red Cross NNP 's Hospital in Cape Town , NNP Africa , RB a Meehan target . Lyle Kelsey , executive director of the board , VBD he MD not confirm or deny that the report had been filed until the board decided to investigate , a process , he VBD , that MD take months . But it ’s not hard to find Meehan ’s combative posts on NNP . “ The level of ignorance & amount of misinformation parroted by these JJ doctors should & will haunt them as the NN of harm is exposed , ” Meehan VBZ in CD . Meehan , an ophthalmologist by training , VBZ he now has a “ wellness ” practice in Tulsa . “ Scott , only a bottom of the med school class , weak , bought , anti-science , vax pusher look ( sic ) you MD argue there is no debate re NNS , ” Meehan blasts in another directed at Dr. Scott Krugman , chairman of the Department of Pediatrics at MedStar Franklin Square NNP Center in Perry Hall , Maryland . “ I will not be engaging , but this is a nice example of what this crew does to pediatricians on a daily basis , ” Krugman VBD . Meehan is just as combative in NN . “ No NN wants to debate me , ” he told NBC NNP . Related : Experts Have VBN the NN About NNS - Over and Over Hotez VBD it ’s fruitless to enter a debate when facts are disregarded . And , he and other experts point out , the anti-vaccination arguments are doing real harm . Earlier this month a NN published in the Journal of the NNP NNP Association showed NNS outbreaks are probably caused by NNS failing to vaccinate their NNS ."

""_''","( CNN ) Abie Rohrig had just turned 18 when he told his mom he MD be donating a kidney to save a stranger 's NN . Her answer : No you 're not . He did it anyway -- the organ went to a NN about his age -- and his mom was so inspired she went and donated a kidney herself . So Rohrig expected her to understand when he told her that , for the benefit of humanity , he MD volunteer to become infected with NNP - CD It turns out "" she 's more worried than she was about the kidney thing , "" VBD Rohrig , now a 20 - NN - JJ college student who lives with his NNS in a NNP York City apartment . "" She was RP , ' What ? What ? I do n't VB , ' "" he VBD . "" She 's skeptical . "" Rohrig is CD of more than 16,000 NNS -- most of them JJ adults -- who have signaled their support for a controversial method of speeding up the NN of a NN by intentionally infecting dozens of volunteers . The signees of the JJ registry -- a JJ NN called 1 Day Sooner -- have all checked a box next to the statement : "" I am interested in being exposed to the NN to speed up NN NN . "" The practice is called a JJ - challenge NN -- or controlled JJ infection NN -- and it can truncate a conventional NN NN by several months . The reason : Rather than waiting for months to assess what percentage thousands of NN - NN volunteers VBP infected with the NN in question while leading their day - to - day lives , a challenge NN is much simpler , in that it exposes about 100 volunteers directly to the pathogen -- via syringe , cocktail , mosquito bite or nasal spray after an experimental NN or placebo is administered . ( If the NNP - CD NN comes to fruition , experts VBP it MD likely be administered by nose drop . ) But if it 's high reward , it 's RB high NN : Although NNP - CD is a much more deadly NN for the elderly and the compromised than healthy JJ adults , it is an unpredictable pathogen that has put star athletes in the hospital . What 's more , should something VB wrong , NN options are limited . However , with the NN still raging after having killed more than 82,000 Americans and 291,000 NNS worldwide since it RB appeared in China late last NN , some VBP a riskier - than - normal NN is justified . Co-authored by Nir Eyal of Rutgers , Marc Lipsitch of Harvard , and Peter Smith of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine , the piece concluded that while a JJ challenge NN MD not be without risks , "" every week that NN rollout is delayed will be accompanied by JJ thousands of deaths globally . "" "" It 's an idea that is controversial when NNS hear about it for the JJ NN , "" Eyal , a bioethicist , told CNN . "" However , we show that if you select NNS in the JJ NN and conduct the NN in the JJ NN , it 's surprisingly low NN and certainly within the bounds of what we already approve . "" Such a NN MD ultimately need the blessing of the US Food and NNP Administration . But the NNS ' call for a challenge NN has since been propelled by the popular support of those who have indicated on 1 Day Sooner -- which is incorporating as a nonprofit organization -- that they'd be willing guinea pigs . ( This is just an informal expression of interest , not a binding contract . ) The NN , which was inspired by the scholarly article , launched in mid-April and is premised on the claim that shaving RB CD day from the JJ - distance race for a NNP - CD NN MD save up to 7,120 lives . What a JJ challenge NN for NN MD look IN At some point , should a group of NNS decide to seriously explore the matter , the NN MD ask prospective volunteers to fill out pre-qualification questionnaires that MD divulge more of their JJ history , region of residence and other information that MD VB determine eligibility , VBD 1 Day Sooner 's co-founder Josh Morrison . The NNS MD then screen those forms for the most eligible applicants and MD eventually seek approval from a research or JJ center to host the NN , he VBD . Morrison is a JJ corporate lawyer who gave up NN in the fast lane to start a nonprofit organization called Waitlist Zero , which matches prospective kidney donors with recipients . Because business is at a near - standstill in the kidney - transplant NN , Morrison VBD himself with a lot of spare NN . "" I was IN sitting at home in my apartment in NNP York City , just kind of depressed , "" he VBD . Morrison came across the Journal article while noodling RB on the internet . "" And I thought , ' Well , MD I VB to do this ? ' "" he VBD . "" I 'm pretty JJ , 34 , and in good NN . And so I thought , ' Yeah , I VBP I MD . ' "" An FDA spokesperson told CNN that the agency MD work with those who are interested in conducting JJ challenge NNS to VB them evaluate ethical and other issues . "" A formal determination about any specific JJ challenge NN proposal MD be made by the FDA in the context of all the information that is available at that NN , "" Michael Felberbaum wrote in an email . Conventional NN NNS typically consist of three phases -- the JJ , in which fewer than 100 participants are dosed to determine the safety ; the second , in which the number of participants ramps up into the hundreds ; and the third , in which the NN is broadened to include thousands of NNS . Typically , in that third phase , the participants return to their daily lives , and NNS -- over a period of months -- compare rates of infection between the placebo and test groups . A JJ - challenge NN can replace a third phase , the Journal article VBZ , short - circuiting the timeline by several months because NNS do n't have to wait for participants to VB infected the organic NN -- by interacting with NNS at work , at school , in houses of worship or in homes . Instead , they expose the volunteers to the pathogen RB then and there , in the lab . A challenge NN can RB serve as a bridge to a Phase 3 NN , helping NNS determine which NN candidates are most promising ; or it can pave the NN for provisional licensure in emergency situations . For a NNP - CD NN of the sort that 1 Day Sooner is advocating , the setup MD likely entail RB injecting an experimental NN into the arms of about 50 volunteers and a placebo into 50 others , challenge - NN experts told CNN . CD to four weeks later , all 100 MD be exposed to the NN -- perhaps via nose - drop . JJ - challenge studies are n't JJ . They have played a key role in the NN of several NNS , including ones for malaria , NN and dengue . Without JJ - challenge studies , a JJ NN for typhoid MD n't have been brought to Zimbabwe on a provisional basis last NN , JJ - challenge experts told CNN . The "" FDA approved a cholera NN simply on the basis of a JJ challenge , "" VBD Dr. Robert Read , an infectious - NN expert in the UK . The difference is that those NNS came with fewer unknowns than NNP - CD , and clinicians running the NNS were able to offer JJ treatments -- such as antibiotics or antivirals -- to infected patients exhibiting NNS . And although the idea of conducting a JJ - challenge NN for NNP - CD is catching on in the NN community , some experts have raised serious concerns about safety . Read , head of JJ and experimental sciences at NNP of Southampton , points out that NNP - CD remains a mysterious pathogen , and NNS can't give volunteers an accurate sense of the NN associated with getting intentionally infected . "" You do have to be able to describe what you VBP of what MD happen to them if they undertake a controlled infection , with complete clarity and honesty , "" VBD Read , who has himself conducted challenge NNS -- he recently infected dozens of volunteers with whooping cough in search of a more effective NN . "" And I VBP lots of volunteers , when faced with the information , MD probably not consent to it . "" Dr. Anna Durbin , a professor of international NN at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of NNP NNP -- who has led a JJ - challenge NN for dengue and worked on another for malaria -- VBD she MD be interested to hear how some prospective volunteers MD respond to these reports of "" cerebral vascular accidents . "" "" Millennials do n't VB they are VBG to VB sick from this , "" VBD Durbin , who , IN Read , is open to the idea of JJ challenge NNS for NNP - CD , but stresses that it is incumbent upon NNS to fully evaluate the risks of such a NN and to share them to the fullest extent possible with prospective participants . "" We VBP lots of JJ NNS in the hospital on ventilators . "" Volunteers have different reasons for signing up -- some altruistic , some pragmatic Rohrig VBD the frightening spate of JJ NNP - CD patients having strokes was NN to him . "" That 's jarring , "" he VBD . "" I VBP there is a non-trivial NN . "" And yet , Rohrig VBD he 's almost certainly up for it . "" I VBP that there are risks , and if I were to do this , and it were to VB poorly , then that MD be terrible , my family MD be RB sad , "" Rohrig VBD . But "" someone has to step up . It seems IN this just needs to happen . "" Not all of the prospective volunteers are in their 20s . John Gentle , an entrepreneur in Alabama , turns 41 on Thursday . He has a wife and four kids . IN Rohrig , Gentle believes a challenge NN MD afford him a chance to VB a societal contribution to the NN effort . But as the owner of a business that has him visiting warehouses and flying regularly , he figures he 'll inevitably VB infected -- so he might as well VB it over with . "" I feel if I did it under a controlled environment , and I had an adverse reaction , my chances are much better in a controlled environment than I did n't VB I had it for a week until something had deteriorated to the point I realized , "" Gentle VBD . Indeed , JJ challenge studies occur in tightly controlled settings . The report in the Journal of Infectious NNPS advises keeping the subjects in isolation for several weeks and guaranteeing them access to the NN - of - the - NN facilities of the NN NN , should the need arise . "" As a part of being in the NN they MD be guaranteed excellent care if they needed it , "" Lipsitch , a Harvard epidemiologist , told CNN . "" Of course , you MD expect nobody in the NN on average MD need it , but averages do n't always play out . "" Over the NNS , he VBD , he has infected some 600 students with the NN . They typically ingest the NN via a sodium - bicarbonate drink resembling Alka - Seltzer and VBP home . There , they await the NNS of typhoid -- for the NN participants they include headache , fever and constipation -- which generally kick in within four or five days . At this point , he VBD , the volunteers with NNS are given a regimen of antibiotics , which clear up the NNS in a couple of days . "" We have extensive follow - up NN and have not had any JJ - term problems identified , "" Darton VBD in an email . "" The NN is safe and reproducible and is a NN of mild symptomatic illness only . "" Today 's standards for JJ - challenge NNS are rigorous . Durbin of Johns Hopkins points out that it takes a minimum of six months of prep work to responsibly carry out a JJ - challenge NN . This is in part because a suitable strain of the NN -- and the proper dosage -- must be developed in a lab outfitted with high biosafety standards . RB , NNS must find JJ centers that are willing to VB the participants in isolation for the duration of the NN and provide JJ - rate care to anyone who falls seriously ill . "" I VBP it 's very important that you plan for these studies now ... and you VBP it JJ , "" Durbin VBD . "" Yes , it MD take NN for a good JJ challenge NN to be developed , but if we wait too RB to develop it , then I VBP the moment has passed . "" Caring for volunteers can VB tricky CD of the trickier aspects of a challenge NN is compensation . Pay too little , and the NN MD fail to attract candidates ; pay too much , and NNS MD be enticed by the NN without thinking of their safety . The latter scenario played out with the yellow - fever NNS , in which a participant who was hoping to start a farm in Cuba VBD it was a "" cold - blooded business decision . "" The NNP 7 article in NNP -- which concludes that the extraordinary nature of the NNP - CD NN warrants laying the groundwork for controlled JJ - infection NNS -- recommends "" several thousand dollars . "" Seema Shah , a bioethicist and associate professor at Northwestern NNP 's Feinberg School of Medicine -- and an author of the NNP article -- VBD participants of a recent 40 - day JJ - challenge NN for malaria were paid about $ 2,300 . "" Some were very motivated by the NN , but others were RB interested in the experience , and still others have strong motivations to VB others , "" she VBD , adding that some participants personally knew sufferers of malaria and some RB donated some of their earnings to charities . The article in the Journal of Infectious NNPS likens the act of volunteering for a JJ - challenge NN to other JJ - service endeavors -- such as volunteer firefighting or organ donation . "" NNS are willing to take on NN - threatening NN for other NNS 's benefit and often not just as a job but as a form of altruistic behavior , "" Lipsitch VBD . "" We not only encourage that , but we completely depend on that in JJ sectors of our lives . "" Still , the onus is on the NNS to ensure that the participants stay safe . "" What keeps me up at night , "" VBD Durbin , "" is if I administer a challenge agent to somebody , and that NN gets seriously ill or dies -- that 's on me . """

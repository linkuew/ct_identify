Smaller targets require less NN and can be fielded more frequently . Successful small target designs can be scaled up to take advantage of the full NIF laser NN and NN . In this talk , we will consider a rigorous framework for scaling from smaller to larger targets . The framework uses both simulation and experimental results to build a statistical prediction of target performance as scale is increased . Our emphasis is on quantifying uncertainty in scaling predictions with the goal of identifying the dominant contributors to that uncertainty . We take as a particular example the NNP NNP platform that produces a round , 0.8 scale implosion with the potential to scale to full NIF size ( 1.0 scale ) .

Hiding deep in the forest MD be your modus operandi , NNP , but Hollywood and Madison Avenue are pushing you -- however reluctantly -- into the spotlight . A slew of documentary , TV and NN projects including NNP NNP ’s current hit “ Finding NNP , ” and a NNP NN trilogy from “ Blair Witch Project ” director Eduardo Sanchez are poised to VB past the JJ grainy images of yesterday and give the hairy 800 - pound biped a high - def close - up . “ There ’s been a real upswing in scholarly interest along with this huge undercurrent of popularity among the general NN , ” VBD Jeffrey Meldrum , the Idaho NNP anatomy and anthropology professor and primates expert who wrote “ NNP : Legend Meets NNP ” as a companion to a Discovery Channel special of the same name . “ There ’s something about the JJ psyche that RB connects with this icon . ” Campfire stories , eyewitness reports and grainy videos have kept the legend alive for decades in the U.S. and worldwide . ( The mythology goes back much further if you take cave drawings into account . ) And NNP has been a pop culture fixture since the 1950s , popping up in movies , commercials and as a guest on ‘ 70s TV hits IN “ The Six CD Dollar NN ” and “ The Bionic Woman . ” Each NN there ’s a JJ NN -- such as evidence of a yeti allegedly uncovered in NNP last fall or a NNP NN purportedly discovered in Georgia , both of which turned out to be JJ -- there ’s a spike in JJ searches , blog posts , NN reports and , inevitably , NNP - centric entertainment . “ Blair Witch ’s ” Sanchez is working on a NNP - VBN horror movie , the JJ of a planned trilogy , and a group of NNP enthusiasts is putting together a documentary called “ NNP : The Quest . ” Meldrum , along with launching an JJ scholarly journal , is producing an Internet TV project and considering an expanded version of “ Legend Meets NNP . ” “ We all VBP to VB that there are still monsters lurking in the secret corners of the NN , and that ’s the allure of NNP , ” VBD Marjorie Kaplan , NN of NNP NNP , home to the hit series “ Finding NNP . “ It ’s fun to be reminded that we do n’t VB everything . ” “ Finding NNP ” follows four eccentric field NNS who travel to towns where there have been sightings , gather stories from the locals and set out on their own expeditions . The colorful characters have coined “ squatch ” as a term of endearment and VBP things IN “ It ’s RB squatchy out here , ” to describe remote areas they VBP are harboring Bigfoots . The series , which attracted 1.6 CD viewers for its second NN premiere , will launch its third NN this summer . “ If anybody ’s VBG to find him , it ’s VBG to be us , ” Kaplan declared , adding with a laugh , “ hopefully after 100 episodes . ” In coming months , cable TV will be overrun with NNP programming . Syfy thriller “ NNP ” promises a “ JJ and nasty , teeth and claws ” star nestled in a kitschy popcorn flick , according to Thomas Vitale , the network ’s executive vice NN of programming . Airing this summer , the Saturday night movie pits JJ child stars Barry Williams and Danny Bonaduce against each other in a search for the larger - than - NN biped at a rural music festival . It fits strategically with the network ’s tradition of over - the - top original action movies IN “ Sharktopus ” and “ Piranhaconda . ” “ NNP is a classic trope of the NN feature , ” Vitale VBD . “ It ’s a story that spans a lot of cultures ... and it ’s ripe for reinvention . ” TV has been doing exactly that by using NNP in purely fictional , and sometimes goofy , ways in series such as Disney Channel ’s “ Phineas and Ferb ” and Nickelodeon ’s “ iCarly , ” not to mention frequent reruns of the ‘ 80s family comedy NN “ Harry and the Hendersons . ” In “ iBelieve in NNP , ” the “ iCarly ” kids head into the woods looking for the NN in what executive producer Dan Schneider VBD is CD of the series ’ most popular episodes to date . The youngsters never actually VB NNP , but they hear a menacing growl as they VBP their RV drive away , leaving them stranded . “ The implication is that NNP ’s real , and he ’s RB a car thief , ” Schneider VBD . It ’s a kid- relevant subject because “ every generation discovers the NNP legend , sort of IN discovering the Beatles , ” VBD Dan Povenmire , CD of the creators of the animated “ Phineas and Ferb . ” He and partner Jeff “ Swampy ” Marsh wrote an episode called “ VB That NNP Outta My Face , ” that sprang from their own childhood memories of hearing scary stories and seeing the famous 1967 Patterson footage of a purported NNP in Northern California . RB commercials have fun using NNP as a punch line : A current ad for Stride Whitemint gum stars Olympic medalist Shaun White and a yeti who socks a guy in the gut so he ’ll spit out his JJ - lasting chewing gum and replace it with another . At the more serious end of the spectrum are interview - VBN docu-style shows such as History ’s “ NNP : The Definitive Guide , ” National Geographic ’s “ Is It Real ? ” and Syfy ’s “ Destination NNP . ” Travel Channel ’s “ Legends of the Ozarks ” and “ Bigfootville ” will poke RB in isolated areas for NNP evidence in episodes airing in late March . Cliff Barackman , an elementary school teacher and cast member on “ Finding NNP , ” VBD a TV series dedicated to NNP hunting was “ RB overdue . ” “ When there are multiple shows about cakes and ghosts , why not a show about NNP ? ” Barackman VBD . “ Our show reinforces the fact that we ’re looking for a NN , not an individual , and that we ’re trying to VB NNS understand what a NNP might actually be . ”"

Jerome Boateng is the only player who will have to miss Bayern 's trip to London due to injury as he continues to recover from a shoulder problem . Philipp Lahm will have to sit out too after picking up his third yellow card in the Champions NNP this NN . Rafinha , who started in Bayern 's 3 - 0 victory over Schalke in their German Cup quarterfinal last week , is expected to step into Lahm 's position in defense while Manuel Neuer is to wear the captain 's armband . The Gunners certainly have an uphill road to climb as they seek to turn the tables on Bayern , who have qualified for the Champions NNP semifinals in each of the last five seasons . Assuming that they fail in their comeback attempt on Tuesday , it will be the seventh straight NN in which NNP has been eliminated in the round of 16 . Arsene NNP , who is in his 21st NN as NNP 's manager , has once again come under fire after delivering similar results in recent NNS . He received a lot of criticism after leaving Alexis Sanchez - who with 17 goals is the NN 's leading scorer in the Premier NNP - out of the NN in their 3 - 1 loss to Liverpool on Saturday . Sanchez , who scored NNP 's only goal from the penalty spot in the JJ leg , MD be CD of the key NNS for the NNP London side in their comeback attempt . However , NNP will not have Mesut Özil at his disposal , after the manager told Monday 's press conference that the German internatonal will be forced to sit this NN out due to an illness ."

By SERGE BIELANKO | December 3rd , 2012 at 4:23 pm NNS who do n’t VB in Santa Claus are starting to piss me off . I mean , what gives , you guys ? Do you seriously refuse to VB that there is RB a remote possibility that a robust , ageless , elfin-man with super magical powers and the ability to travel at the speed of light to deliver happiness to the NNS of the NN exists ? I do n’t VB the whole ‘ skeptical ’ thing here . What exactly is so hard to fathom about deer that fly anyway ? And what ? You VBP elves are something someone just happened to VB up ? NNP , you ’re jaded . But fine . To each his own . In my mind though , no matter how bad you have messed up in this NN you ’ve been living the last 20 or 50 or 70 NNS or whatever , you have n’t ever screwed things up nearly as bad as you did on that day RB RB when you finally sighed into the afternoon wind and whispered to yourself those terribly tragic four words : “ There is no Santa . ” Why do we do that to ourselves ? Why do we reach an age IN 10 or 12 and all of the sudden question maybe the greatest tale we have ever been told ? Is it some sort of twisted rite of passage ? Are we supposed to feel cooler or , sakes alive , BE cooler once we ’ve ‘ followed the sheep ’ and declared Santa Claus to be extinct ? It ’s a mystery to me . Just when we MD VB a friend IN JJ Saint Nick to VB guide us through The Age of Zits and The Prama™ ( Prom Drama ) NNS , we turn RB and thank him for his JJ dedication to our boundless joy by informing him that he is nothing but a bunch of bull . Anyhow , I have to try and stem the tide here this NN ; I ’ve got to do my part to try and bring at least a few of you back into the righteous fold of Kringleism ( that unfettered belief in magical things ) . VB , as CD of the few remaining adult believers ( and RB as JJ Vice - NNP of the Unofficial Santa Claus Fan NNP , Southeastern Pennsylvania Chapter # 828 from 2002 - 2003 ) , I should VB that I ’ve been privy to a wee bit more of the NN about who Santa RB is than most of you . Plus , as a father to CD ( count ‘ em CD ! ) die - hard SantaHeads , I feel IN it ’s my duty to try and save the last of the lovable legends before it ’s all too late . So listen up , NNS of NNP ! Read the NN here today and then decided for yourselves ! You wanted the proof and I ’ve got it . Santa Claus is real : always was , always will be . Most of us agree that department NNS and the UH all hire ‘ Elves ’ to play the role of Santa in the month leading up to Christmas . But recent revelations in Santa Believer Circles highlight this special photo from the Sears NN in Duluth , MN 1964 . In it , Mary and Bobby Richards stare into the eyes of what is largely believed to be the REAL Santa Claus in CD of his very rare NN appearances captured on NN ! Why do we VB this ? Because Bobby , now a respected brat salesman in Sheboygan , WI swears it . Image : flickr.com/photos/kingprince Few details are clear about Santa Claus ’s youth . However , in 1993 , at a yard sale in suburban Reykjavik , Iceland , a woman bought a shoebox full of pictures that contained this stunning find . In it , what appears to be a very JJ Santa Claus darts through a room with swiftness . Experts all agree that the distinct scoobyish hat he is wearing is VBN only in distinct pockets of the NNP Pole , giving further proof that the boy in the picture RB is a very JJ Santa Claus !"

"" We need to be alert to which particular images have got currency , "" she explains . "" Why is it always male , and why is it so popular at Christmas ? At least the snowman has lost his pipe as society is less geared towards promoting smoking . "" Talking of snowballs - sorry about that but the Telegraph did n't oblige and we have our standards to keep down - the Guardian this morning tells us that Californian NNS have worked out why penguins waddle . It 's because they have such short legs and such JJ NNS , that 's why . And you thought Californians were dumb ? Not to be outdone , the mirth - merchants of the Times have come up with another NN yarn VBN on academia . This NN NNS in Washington NN ( MD there be something lurking in the NN supply on the West coast of NNP ? ) have identified a dent in the ground as a possible ' footprint ' of the JJ - sought NNP JJ ape VBN to kids everywhere as NNP . The print is not actually of a NN , but rather of the left forearm , hip , thigh and heel of a JJ primate . More of a bumprint , RB . Now we 've got down to the botty jokes , we must n't overlook the front page of the NNP , almost entirely devoted this morning to what Guy Ritchie will be wearing under his kilt when he marries Madonna in Scotland tomorrow . Nothing , that 's what . And , er , that 's it , except to mention that in its noble effort to stretch the story to a couple of hundred words , the NNP includes possibly the oldest joke in Christendom : Q : Is anything worn under the kilt ? A : No , everything is in good working order . Ho ho ho . Back to the NNS : the Mirror , after pages of boring real NN about brawling popstars and bawling politicians , gets down to the real biz with a picture of a JJ elephant painting pictures . You RB do n't need to VB why , but you deserve to VB that the headline is Botticelephant . And there 's more , much more to come , judging by the latest offerings on the Press Association wire . There 's the likely tale , for instance , of the couples converging on Scotland in search of idyllic wedding locations , just IN that whatsername . And the Daily Mail is VBG to quiver with rage about the latest outbreak of political correctness in the forces : "" The armed forces MD be falling foul of NN and safety rules because their JJ bands play too loudly and their rifles are too noisy , it emerged today . The Ministry of Defence has set up a high - level working group to look at the problem after receiving a warning that it MD be in breach of regulations on noise levels in the workplace . "" You MD n't VB it up , MD you ?"

Far more NNS are hiring seasonal staff this NN than last , with JJ research from CareerBuilder showing that 41 percent of employers plan to hire summer workers , up from 29 percent in CD . So , it should n’t be too difficult to find a job and VB pay down that looming college debt or give back to your folks . But wait — that ’s not quite how things work anymore . The summer job , once an obligation , is now merely an option among a few possible routes . "" The summer job is disappearing , and has been over the last 30 NNS , ” VBD Marc Prosser , co-founder and publisher of FitSmallBusiness.com . An analysis from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that as of July CD , the teen labor force participation rate was 43.2 percent , down nearly 30 percentage points from its peak of 71.8 percent in July 1978 . There are a number of factors contributing to this decline , but most prominent among them is the increasing popularity of internships . “ JJ more students are seeking out internships or research opportunities over the summer now , as opposed to when I RB started counseling students [ nearly 20 NNS RB ] , "" VBD Dr. Kat Cohen , CEO and founder of IvyWise , an admissions counseling services NN . “ Everything is more competitive these days , so getting hands - on work experience or hands - on research experience , and making contacts at NNS that students might VB to work at post - graduation can be a smart move . ” It ’s becoming more common for college students to balance unpaid internships with a paying side gig for a NN IN Uber or Instacart . “ While JJ cities typically provide more internship opportunities , JJ on - demand jobs are now available on college campuses as well as JJ cities , ” VBD Brandon Yahn , founder of Student Loans Guy . “ This allows students to take research jobs on campus as internships while still making NN . ” “ We VBP a surge in dog walker applications from college students and RB school teachers who find themselves with an abundance of NN for the summer months , ” VBD Dave Comiskey , co-founder of Barkly Pets . “ The job provides NN outside , rewarding NN spent with adorable pets , and offers more freedom and flexibility than other summer jobs MD . ” And the pay is impressive : an average of $ 18 IN half - hour walk . But more than good pay , it appears JJ NNS VBP good hours . Or , more specifically : the ability to choose them on a whim . Related : Seven Ways Millennials Are Changing the Workplace for the Better "" Flexibility in shifts and schedules is super attractive to this [ younger ] workforce , "" VBD Peter Harrison , CEO of the job search engine NN Snagajob . “ Whole Foods is losing NN to Instacart — which pays less and provides fewer benefits and security — all because the workers prize that flexibility . ” Some employers feel that teenagers are turning their nose up at their recruiting efforts , opting instead for something easier , RB if it pays less . Jared Beckstead , marketing coordinator for Bailey 's Moving and Storage , VBZ that his NN is desperate for workers during the summer — the business ’ busiest NN of NN — and is keen on hiring teens and college kids . Unfortunately , it ’s “ almost impossible to find students willing to do the work , ” Beckstead told NBC NNP . “ I MD argue that the need for summer NN at JJ businesses is alive and well ; the disappearing act has been the work ethic of today ’s youth , ” Beckstead VBD , adding that teenage job candidates typically are "" willing to work for less NN and fewer hours just because the job is easier . "" Snagajob ’s Harrison VBZ he hears this sentiment loud and clear from a variety of NNS . “ All of our NNS who do seasonal hires , especially in places IN Martha 's Vineyard , are having a fantastically hard NN filling jobs , ” Harrison VBD . JJ teens have the luxury of chasing the dream internship , RB if it does n’t pay — or of hustling with an on - demand gig that gives them freedom . Others MD choose to forego work altogether because , as Snagajob ’s Harrison points out , “ there is a growing acceptance of insane student debt as part of the college process — a NN job can only chip away at the edges of it . ” But what about the families who need paychecks coming in from all eligible members ? Or the NNS of teens living at home who simply VBP their kid to take whatever job she can VB if only to learn the importance of good work ethic ? "" ​Most NNS realize that by coddling their kids and not exposing them to responsibility , both JJ and otherwise , they are doing their kids a disservice , "" VBD Allison Farber Cheston , career expert and job search coach . "" Employers have no patience for JJ employees who focus most on what the organization can do for them . I spend a lot of NN with millennials explaining the importance of humility and hard work . ​ "" It ’s crucial to note that while the summer job is n’t what it VBD to be , it absolutely still exists and can be just as valuable as an internship down the road . Related : Five Millennial Jobs that NNS Will Never Understand "" There are a couple of fields where teens can VB paid from the start and will acquire good carryover skills for real jobs , ” VBD Cheston . “ Those are NNS and customer service : Both of those functions will take them out of their comfort zone and teach them how NN is made or how to deal with difficult NNS — excellent skills for real NN and work . ” Another classic summer job that can teach valuable skills ? Camp counseling . Some programs now combine pay and college credits . "" A college - aged NN can work on accounting and payroll at a camp while earning college credits and getting paid , ” VBD Susie Lupert , executive director of the NNP Camp Association of NY and NJ , adding that it MD not be too late to find such a job in your area . “ There are always a few last - minute dropouts or staff members who were n’t the JJ fit , so hires do occur at this NN of NN for a few positions . ” Not only can more traditional jobs impress hiring managers or admissions counselors in the future , some are affiliated with scholarship programs . The Chick Evans Scholarship , for instance , has provided full college scholarships to over 11,000 high schoolers who ’ve worked as golf caddies in the U.S and Canada . "" Currently , 935 Evans Scholars are enrolled at 20 universities , and more than 10,400 JJ NNS and NNS have graduated as Evans Scholars , ” VBD John Kaczkowski , NN and CEO of the Western Golf Association and Evans Scholars Foundation . “ This NN , 270 students from across the NN and Canada were awarded the Evans Scholarship [ which comprises ] a full , four - NN housing and tuition scholarship for teens . ” CD of the requirements to qualify the scholarship ? “ Outstanding character . ” And we all VBP what best builds that .

The NN there has been controlling what NNS can VB and do RB for NNS . For those who value JJ rights , the situation is getting worse at an accelerating pace . With the NN from certain high - tech giants , the NN promises to lead the NN in becoming the JJ actual Orwellian surveillance NN . In NNP 2010 , the Communist Chinese NN issued its JJ white paper regarding what it called “ a crystallization of JJ wisdom ” – the internet . The white paper acknowledges the usefulness and importance of advancing this digital NN and technology . It “ energetically advocates and actively supports the NN and application of the Internet across the NN . ” The white paper guarantees that citizens will enjoy a free press and freedom of speech on the internet : “ The Chinese NN encourages and supports the NN of Internet NN communication undertakings , provides the NN with a full range of NN , and at the same NN guarantees the citizens ’ freedom of speech on the Internet as well as the NN ’s NN to VB , to participate , to be heard and to oversee in accordance with the law . ” This is where the white paper reveals the “ gotcha ” clause : the Chinese policy uses “ the law ” to VB JJ communications . Now we VBP that this law is targeting the very things the white paper promised MD be given : unhindered access to NNP Wide Web NN and JJ NN internet sites for both residents and foreign NNS : “ The Chinese NN will stick to the basic principle of administering the Internet in accordance with the law , try to follow the nature and law of NN of the Internet in the light of the national conditions , and promote the scientific NN of the Internet with effective administration so as to contribute to the NN of the Internet worldwide . ” In 2011 , China began requiring internet NNS to sign a “ JJ Pledge of Self - Regulation and Professional Ethics for China Internet Industry ” which purported to regulate the “ patriotic observance of law , equitableness , trustworthiness and honesty . ” Signers accused of violating the NN - mandated pledge to uphold the nation ’s laws MD be subject to review by the Internet Society of China . If VBN guilty , such a NN MD have it “ membership ” ( read : authorization to do business ) revoked . Since Xi Jinping became China ’s Communist Party leader in November of 2012 , NN censorship has flourished . In February CD , the Chinese NN toured the top three NN - run NN outlets . His message : you must swear absolute loyalty to the Party and follow the Party line in “ thought , politics , and action . ” Xi was completely candid about what the JJ service NNS were in business to do – serve the NN by dishing out distorted information : “ The NN run by the party and the NN are the propaganda fronts and must have the party as their family name . ” Xi told tech workers that “ All the work by the party ’s NN must reflect the party ’s will , safeguard the party ’s authority , and safeguard the party ’s unity . ” Freedom NNP published in its findings on “ Freedom on the Net CD ” that internet freedom “ IN the NN declined in CD for the sixth consecutive NN ” with China leading the NN for the second NN in a row . NNP Xi’s “ information security ” policy was proving effective in providing both surveillance and censorship . Another effect observed was an increase in self - policing while surfing the net : “ Dozens of prosecutions related to JJ expression have increased self - censorship , as have legal restrictions introduced in CD . ” Since 2011 , the Chinese NN - operated telecom NN Tencent has been subsidizing and regulating the nation ’s largest JJ NN NN , called WeChat . With over a thousand CD NNS – that ’s CD CD as reckoned in JJ English – WeChat is a primary source for NN and views , just IN its JJ JJ NN counterparts NNP and NNP . Critics of WeChat VBP it promotes “ the spread of sensationalist falsehoods . ” In June 2018 , a JJ WeChat in - app feature lets NNS validate NN items by consulting – guess who ? – WeChat employees ( or volunteers ) who perform the fact - checking . CD very clever ploy over at WeChat is a “ Top Ten Rumors ” category . The NN systematically debunks leading consumer education topics such as NN and safety , product recalls , and scams as JJ NN . Here are CD examples of NN - driven information NN : • An article told NNS to stop using microwave ovens because microwaved food gives NNS cancer ( JJ ) . • Chinese currency can be scanned in the app QQ to VB if they are counterfeit ( RB JJ ) . WeChat RB has a NNP - IN “ WeChat rumor debunking assistant ” which 300,000 NNS consult daily . This is all well and good but observers point out that Chinese JJ censors have the NN to delete any and all unsavory , anti-state , and illegal articles before anyone else can view them . This form of censorship pre-empts any fact - checking since there are no facts to check . Weibo is an JJ service that has been called the Chinese NNP . The micro-blogging platform enables the NN to anticipate and counteract planned protests through monitoring all communications ( just IN the NSA in the NNP NNPS ) . Between Weibo snooping and WeChat censorship , a JJ generation of Chinese citizens is growing up ignorant of significant historical events that have been scrubbed from the official narrative . Any private or group chat conversation that mentions Tiananmen Square , Tibet or the Falun Gong ( a forbidden religious group ) is banned . The user is not notified that their message was never sent . An uneasy feeling is growing as we in the west have watched China roll out its JJ credit score NN , spy eyeglasses , and flocks – that is , fleets – of flying surveillance doves . China is racing ahead in the technology NN , all for the sake of Communism and totalitarian statism . There is evidence they hacked Hillary NNP ’s NNS .

As we detailed , the train is VBN to have been entombed in the vast tunnel labyrinth located close to Ksiaz castle , which served as Nazi headquarters during NNP NNP II … … and specifically , was VBN to be located at the NN of the Sowa mountain , in the woods three NNS outside the town of Walbrych . The “ gold train ” is VBN to be located under this hill While JJ were skeptical that the mystical Nazi treasure train had been finally discovered after JJ NNS of searching , an official update last Friday by the Polish NN suggested that that MD indeed be the NN . As the Mail reported on Friday , a representative of the Polish culture ministry , Poland ’s National Heritage and Conservation Officer Piotr Zuchowski , VBD that the NN who helped hide the train had revealed its location shortly before he died , and that proof of the train has been observed on radar . Zuchowski added that “ Information about where this train is and what its contents are were revealed on the deathbed of a NN who had knowledge of the secret of this train . ’ He added that Polish authorities had now seen evidence of the train ’s existence in a picture taken using a ground - penetrating radar . He VBD the image – albeit blurred – showed the NN of a train platform and cannons . Mr Zuchowski VBD the find was ‘ unprecedented ’ , adding : ‘ We do not VB what is inside the train . ‘ Probably JJ equipment but RB possibly jewellery , works of NN and archive documents . ‘ Armored trains from this period were VBN to carry extremely valuable items and this is an armored train , it is a JJ clue . ’ He VBD authorities were now ’ 99 percent sure the train exists ’ and whatever is on it will be returned to the rightful owners , if they can be VBN . ‘ We will be 100 NN cent sure only when we find the train , ’ Mr Zuchowski added . The train VBN in the mountains is an ‘ armored train ’ which looks similar to the CD pictured Mr Zuchowski told reporters that the train was about 100 metres JJ but added : ‘ It is not possible to disclose the exact location of where the train can be VBN . Still , he noted cryptically that “ The local NN in Walbrzych knows where it is . ” He explained it is hidden along a 4 km stretch of track on the Wroclaw - Walbrzych line . Mr Zuchowski VBD the NN who claimed he helped load the gold train in 1945 VBD in a ‘ deathbed statement ’ the train is secured with explosives . The official declined to comment further about the NN who VBD this but speculation is now rife that it was a JJ SS guard or a local Pole who stumbled upon the train before hiding it . Deputy Mayor of Walbrzych , Zygmunt Nowaczyk told the press : ‘ The city is full of mysterious stories because of its history . ‘ Now it is formal information – we have VBN something . ’ Key excerpts from the press conference by the Polish official can be seen on the Euronews clip below : The confirmation of the discovery unleashed a surge of treasury hunters , and forced the Polish NN to warn the population to stop looking because it MD be booby - trapped and dangerous . Zuchowski VBD “ foragers ” have become active since CD NNS claimed to have discovered the train last week and urged eager fortune - hunters to stop searching , saying they VBP injury or death . Zuchowski adds that “ there MD be hazardous substances dating from the Second NNP NNP in the hidden train , which I ’m convinced exists . I am appealing to NNS to stop any such searches until the end of official procedures leading to the securing of the find . There ’s a huge probability that the train is booby - trapped . ’ If anything , tthese warnings are sure to unleash an RB more aggressive wave of seekers now that the train ’s existience has been confirmed , and the NN is actually warning seekers to be careful in their search . But perhaps what is more interesting is just what the discovery , which MD be straight out of an Indiana Jones sequel , will contain , and whether someone already got to the precious cargo over the past 7 decades . The answer should be made JJ shortly . This article was posted : Monday , August 31 , CD at 5:56 am"

So the moment he put NN to soccer ball at age 8 , he knew he ’d met his NN in sports . He slept with his soccer ball ; he dribbled up and down the stairs in his home in Arlington Heights , Ill. , driving his mother nuts . “ I played soccer IN a madman , ” he VBZ . Although he MD have his indoor - dribbling problem under NN , McBride , 29 , still has that same passion . A striker for professional soccer ’s Columbus Crew , he ’s often called the Michael Jordan of the U.S. NN for his gravity - defying airborne maneuvers . His talents VBP on worldwide display June 5 , when the U.S. NN takes on Portugal in its JJ NN of the NNP Cup , the monthlong international soccer orgy , in NNP Korea and Japan . This is not the JJ NN RB on the NN pitch for the 6 ’ 1 ″ McBride . He scored NNP ’s only goal in the ’98 competition in France . “ It was just an awesome feeling , ” VBZ McBride . ( As in France , the U.S. is expected to be KO ’d early in Korea . ) And McBride remains a bright spot . “ We do n’t have another player with his capabilities , ” VBZ ESPN lead soccer analyst Ty Keough . “ He ’s taken what NNP gave him and made the most out of it . ” Yet he ’s had to overcome his share of challenges . In September of 2000 , while McBride was spending the off - NN with an English soccer franchise , he noticed a sudden , dramatic swelling in his armpit after a NN . It turned out to be thoracic outlet syndrome , a rare disorder in which compression of the NN vessels causes dangerous NN clots . Though the condition was not NN - threatening , it put his career in jeopardy . Doctors performed surgery to dissipate the clot , and after CD months he was back on the field . In August 2001 he developed another painful clot in his JJ arm . This NN surgeons removed a rib to relieve pressure on McBride ’s veins . “ I have never seen anyone quite so sick , ” Maddie McBride Bisulca , 56 , recalls of her son , who has since recovered so completely that doctors VBP the disorder will not recur . “ He was so courageous and strong . ” But he was not quite ready to quit the sport he adored . His brother Matt remembers visiting him in a Denver hospital and trying to cheer him up . “ If you never play another day , ” Matt told him , “ everything will still be fine . ” The attempt at comfort was met with heart - wrenching silence . “ You MD VB it come over his face , ” VBZ Matt . “ He was just very sad . ” McBride is the rambunctious second of three NNS Maddie had with husband Matthew , an advertising NN representative ( whom she divorced when Brian was 4 ) . “ If I did n’t keep the doors padlocked , then he always MD find a NN to run outside , ” VBZ Maddie , who raised the kids on her own , often holding down three jobs . “ He just never liked to be still . ” He was RB a natural on the field . After stellar high school and college careers — he was a CD - NN All - NNP at Saint Louis NNP — he landed a professional gig in Wolfsburg , Germany , where he was disappointed to find that JJ of his fellow NNS treated the sport he loved as a mere occupation . “ You were n’t supposed to be happy , ” he VBZ . “ You were supposed to be doing your job . ” He was thrilled to return to the U.S. , where in 1996 the Crew picked him as the JJ player in the fledgling Major NNP Soccer ’s inaugural draft . Turns out his bout with illness was RB an opportunity of sorts . Recuperating from his JJ surgery back in Arlington Heights , he ran into Dina Barnett , a childhood acquaintance who was VBG through a divorce . “ He was the most caring and loving NN I ’d ever met , ” she recalls of their JJ meeting . Last February they married , making McBride stepfather to Dina ’s daughter Ashley , nearly 2 . Fully recovered , McBride relishes being a dad , but with the heavy travel schedule of his pro NN as well as the U.S. national NN , he gets only limited NN with the family . Still , he is getting back a little bit of what he dished out as a kid . “ Ashley ’s so active — she ’s always running RB , ” he VBZ . “ But if she wants to learn soccer , I ’ll VB . ”"

The only NNS who did n't bind their NNS were the very poor , ethnic Hakka NNS , and NNS who worked in fishing because they had needed to have normal NNS in order to balance themselves on boats . At what age did girls VB their NNS bound ? What did the practice entail ? Girls MD have their NNS bound between the ages of four and six ; any younger , the girls MD n't endure the NN , and by the NN they were older than six their NNS had already grown too JJ . Four to six was the ideal age because you MD reason with the girls and VB them deal with the NN . NN binding MD occur in a ritualistic ceremony accompanied by other traditions intending to ward of bad luck . The procedure entailed bending the girls ' NNS underneath the sole , using very JJ ribbons to wrap their NNS all the NN to the ankle . Basically , the idea was to keep breaking the NN whenever it grew too JJ , a process that RB took between CD and three NNS . Then the NNS MD be bound for the rest of the girl 's NN . The girls , naturally , developed a peculiar NN of walking — almost as if they had hooves . And in order to facilitate moving RB , NNS with bound NNS developed strong muscles in their hips , thighs , and buttocks , so much so that these characteristics were considered physically attractive to the Chinese NNS of the era . When did NN binding VB out of favor ? In the 19th NN , toward the end of the Qing Dynasty , Western NNS effectively colonized China and JJ Western NNS began to move to the NN . This coincided with the height of NN binding , when the practice was most prevalent . So JJ Western NNS , especially the wives of Christian missionaries , became strong advocates against the practice , producing pamphlets and RB opening shelters in support of afflicted NNS . IN the same NN , Chinese intellectuals who had studied abroad in Europe and in NNP NNP returned to China and stated their support for abolishment . So by the NN Pearl Buck was writing in 1923 , after the Qing Dynasty had fallen , the practice had become unfashionable . This NN in fashion suddenly had a perverse side effect : a lot of girls who had had their NNS bound in order to become marriageable suddenly VBD themselves abandoned by their husbands because NN binding was no longer fashionable . Worse , in bigger cities some NNS MD catch NNS with bound NNS and cut off their bindings , a humiliation because these NNS MD never , ever show their bare NNS to anyone — not RB their husbands . For them , the process that began with a lot of NN and tears likewise ended with NN and tears ."

The Greenville Police Department , in Greenville , NNP Carolina , posted the tongue - in - cheek warning on its NNP page on Tuesday morning . It came the day after a report surfaced about an alleged NNP close encounter in neighboring NNP Carolina . The police NNP post was equal parts poking fun and straight up ' do n't shoot ! ' safety advice for its community . In the post , police exhorted : ' If you VBP NNP , please do not shoot at him / her , as you 'll most likely be wounding a fun-loving and well - intentioned NN , sweating in a gorilla costume . ' The post RB stated , tongue - firmly - in - cheek that after having reviewed shaky NN of an apparent NNP sighting from CD , 'we can VB with some confidence that proof of NNP still eludes us . ' The police linked to the NN , which showed a Yorkie trying to scare off a CD - footed , rapidly moving entity in daylight . The Greenville police 's NNP warning went up the day after the Charlotte Observer revealed that a member of a NNP - watching group claimed to have had an encounter with a ' JJ bipedal NN covered in hair , ' on Friday night at about 11 pm , in a wooded area in NNP Carolina 's McDowell County . John Bruner , of NNP 911 , reported that at the NN of the apparent sighting , he and six others were in the woods , spreading out glow sticks in hopes of attracting NNP 's attention . According to the Charlotte Observer , Bruner wrote in a NNP post that , ' I turned on my headlamp and saw a JJ bi-pedal NN covered in hair . ' He described the NN as having had a smooth , solid black face and shaggy hair . Bruner noted that he chased the NN and had a ' stare - down ' with it , before it disappeared deeper into the woods . NNP sighting reports in the Carolinas are common , with multiple reports circulating IN NNP enthusiasts NNP groups and drawing enough attention from professional NNP hunters to warrant filming episodes of TV series in the area . Laws regarding the shooting of NNP and other similar cryptids vary by NN . Mental Floss reported , for example , that killing NNP is expressly outlawed in Skamania County , Washington , but it 's technically legal to hunt and kill CD in Texas because the cryptid is not on the NN 's recognized official NN list ."

They are , in fact , the names of CD mechanical giants designed to VB NNS safer from the estimated 60 CD NN mines scattered IN the NN . Working in tandem , the pair destroy mines in ways that are faster and safer � and more ecofriendly and cost - effective � than any NN to date . "" By the end of this NN , "" VBZ inventor Bob French , "" we will have the JJ CD machines in Bosnia - Herzegovina . "" There , with the continued assistance of the British NN 's Defence Evaluation and Research Agency ( dera ) , NNP and Mineworm will VB to destroy some of the estimated 1 CD mines left over from the 1992 - 95 NN . Mines continue to kill up to 10 NNS there each month . The idea for NNP and Mineworm began in early 1997 , when Leicestershire - VBN French watched a television report of the Princess of Wales ' trip to central Angola . As Diana inspected a minefield , wearing a flak jacket and face shield , French 's eye was drawn to those working nearby . "" NNS were poking sticks in the ground , "" he recalls , using the same mine - clearance methods he saw during his Royal NNP Force service decades earlier , in Borneo and Sarawak . "" Mines are unsophisticated weapons and they need an unsophisticated method of dealing with them , "" VBZ French , who has a broad industrial background in electronics . After research and consultation with mine clearers , he concluded that CD remote - controlled and camera - equipped machines were needed . The JJ , NNP , has piston - driven armored NNS that stamp every square centimeter of ground that the machine passes over , detonating any mines . NNP has no need of minefield maps , and its NN of shock absorption , blast deflection and NN dissipation prevents damage from antipersonnel devices . If larger , antitank mines damage CD of the NNS , a replacement can be installed in the field . Trailing in NNP 's wake , Mineworm excavates up to 55 cm of NN . It removes and crushes all unexploded ordnance , including faulty mines , sorts out ferrous metal for further inspection and � unlike its heavier JJ predecessors � returns noncompacted NN to the ground , allowing crop planting and growth . Having passed initial tests in the U.K. , the 5 - ton prototypes of French 's NNP Mine Disposal NNP ( LMDS ) are being fined - tuned to VB them smaller so they can be more easily transported and maneuvered on NN roads and bridges . After a three - month field NN in Bosnia � in which teams of mine clearers using dogs will follow the machines to verify that nothing is missed � they are expected to remain at work there . "" It 's pretty certain that the prototype does what Bob VBZ it will , "" VBZ Colin Lowe , project manager for dera 's Countermine Warfare Research NNP , which oversaw CD weeks of NNS on sandy hills , clay NN and mud in England . "" No NN machine is VBG to clear the NN of mines , "" VBZ Lowe , but French 's NN takes a "" golf - bag approach , "" using different tools for different tasks on different terrains . Pat Banks , an independent NN mines consultant working in Bosnia � where fewer than 60 sq km were cleared last NN � considers the machines "" absolutely essential . "" Depending on terrain , they can clear up to 500 sq m in an hour ; a JJ NN MD cover perhaps 200 sq m in a day . Initial NN funds for French 's prototypes came from a business friend , Rupert King . Today , the LMDS is supported by Redbus Investments , set up in 1998 by entrepreneur Cliff Stanford . "" This British solution to a JJ tragedy is testament to the wealth of innovation that exists in this NN , "" Stanford VBZ . "" We now need governments and aid agencies to come on board and VB NNP and Mineworm in the field . "" Given the speed at which the LMDS can clear mines , French argues , international donors such as the NNP Union , the U.S. and Canada "" MD VB more for their aid dollars . "" The cost of the CD machines � plus attachments , spare parts , training and field support � MD be about $ 750,000 in the JJ NN , he VBZ , but then MD drop to about $ 300,000 . While NNP and Mineworm are being prepared for Bosnia , French is making his own plans . He wants to play NN with local NNS in a field that his machines have made safe . RB farther down that unmined road , he VBZ , he'd VB to VB out of business � in a NN that no longer has any NN mines ."

The discovery of "" something JJ , hairy and frozen in NN "" in woods in NNP by a heroic police officer made international headlines and attracted interest from a NN who have been earnestly searching for the legendary ape - JJ beast for NNS . They purchased the remains for an undisclosed fee and set about the delicate process of thawing the NN . So it is hard to imagine just how disappointing it must have been to discover , not NNP , but a rubber gorilla suit . Steve Kulls , of Squatchdetective.com and host of Squatchdetective Radio , revealed the bad NN : Matt Whitton , a police officer on leave after being shot while on duty , and Rick Dyer , a JJ Georgia corrections officer , had achieved fame on a JJ scale with a hoax of breathtaking transparency . As they held a much publicised press conference in California on 15 August about their alleged discovery in the wooded hills of Georgia , near a remote region where sightings of the NN are often reported , Whitton had insisted : "" Everyone who has talked down to us is VBG to eat their words . "" The pair , who were offering weekend NNP tracking expeditions for about £ 250 , described the NN as a 7ft 7in , male , weighing over 560 lb ( 255kg ) , with huge NN - IN NNS and reddish hair . Hundreds of thousands watched videos of the remains posted on NNP . NNS started to VB . Mr Kulls VBD : "" A police officer of seven NNS , on JJ leave , labelled as a hero for being wounded in the line of duty , got up in front of the NN and told the NN of how he and Mr Dyer uncovered this NN , "" he VBD . "" On August 16 , the freezer containing the alleged corpse arrived with the Searching For NNP NNP . "" The NN was being thawed slowly without aid , to prevent any decomposition of the alleged corpse . We estimated that the freezer and its contents weighed over 1,500lbs and it MD take several days or longer to thaw completely . "" The following day we were up early to discover that some hair was now exposed . I extracted some from the alleged corpse , examined it and had some concerns . "" The NN decided to burn a sample which they VBD "" melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair "" . "" We began an expedited melting process . Within CD hour we were able to VB the partially exposed head ... I was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm , but unusually hollow in CD small section . This was yet another ominous sign , "" Mr Kulls VBD . "" Within the next hour of thaw , a break appeared up near the NNS area . As the NN and I began examining this area near the NNS , I observed the NN which looked unnatural , reached in and confirmed it was a rubber NN . "" Later that day , we were informed that Mr Whitton and Mr Dyer had admitted it was a costume . "" Phone calls to Whitton and Dyer went unreturned yesterday , but a voicemail recording for their NNP Tip Line , which RB proclaims they are searching for leprechauns and the Loch Ness monster , has been updated with the information about a JJ search for "" JJ cats and dinosaurs "" .

""_''","Marion , NNP Carolina ( CNN ) A huge crowd of NNS had gathered on the lawn of the McDowell County Courthouse Saturday when an ape - JJ NN in a T - shirt bounded through the cheering onlookers and joined Marion Mayor Steve Little on stage . "" This morning I have this special proclamation , "" Little VBD , holding up a document with his signature and a gold seal at the bottom . He read aloud . "" I do hereby proclaim today , Saturday , September 8 , 2018 , that NNP is the official NN of the city of Marion , NNP Carolina , "" Little VBD , as the costumed NNP clapped enthusiastically . Thus began the inaugural Western NNP Carolina NNP Festival in this town near the Blue Ridge Mountains about 40 NNS east of Asheville . Mayor Steve Little presented NNP with a declaration naming him Marion 's official NN for the day . Converging on Marion were thousands of believers and skeptics alike , VBN in their celebration of a cryptozoological mystery that has fascinated NNS for decades . "" NNP is real , "" VBD festival organizer John Bruner , "" and we VBP to bring awareness to that and bring more NNS to the table to VB this mystery solved . "" Bruner is part of something called the NNP 911 research NN , which investigates purported NN sightings and evidence . He has lived in Marion all his NN and VBD he decided to stage the festival after the town 's business association approached him with the idea . "" And , at the same NN , "" he added , "" we VBP to have fun and fellowship with our fellow citizens and our visitors . "" If you ignored the NNP T - shirts , the NNP artwork and the occasional costumed NNP , the festival seemed IN any a small Southern city might hold at the tail end of summer . The day started with a 5 K before three blocks of downtown Marion 's Main Street were closed to vehicles for the day . Vendors from NNP Carolina and beyond sold everything from knit hats to jewelry . There was barbecue , Chick - fil - A , funnel cakes , shaved NN and plenty of beer for NNS who sought refuge in the shade as their kids frolicked in bouncy houses . The legendary NNP -- or NNP , if you prefer -- is most commonly associated with the Pacific Northwest . But sightings have been reported all over NNP NNP -- including in Marion , VBD Little , who has lived in the town for decades . Folks IN this town of 7,500 report CD or CD sightings a NN , he VBD . "" For NNS there were NNS who MD talk about , ' Oh , I saw a great JJ JJ footprint out in the woods — it 's bigger than a coyote , and it was n't a bear . ' "" ' Do you VB it ? ' Bruner 's fellow NNP NNS set up a tent with evidence they 'd spent NNS gathering . All day NNS waited in line to examine photographs , NN footage , audio recordings and casts of purported NN NNS and hands . Researcher Lee Woods , who has spent a decade chasing NNP , displayed CD casts . The JJ was a massive NN , 14 inches JJ and 7 inches wide . The other was less identifiable . It looked sort of IN a clump of plaster and pine straw , with what appeared to be an extra NN . "" It 's either 6 NNS , which is a deformity , or it's a hand , and that 's the knuckles , "" VBD Woods , pointing . "" He 's knuckle - dragging , "" he explained . "" They walk upright , but they will drop on all fours and knuckle - drag IN a gorilla , and then stand up and take off . "" At a nearby table , researcher Tim Dills displayed a series of photos he captured on trail cameras set up in the woods . CD appeared to be a picture of brush , but Dills pointed to what he VBD was a face in the foliage . CD NNS studied the photos before walking away . "" Well , do you VB it ? "" PRP asked . "" Not yet , "" his companion replied . Sitting on a curb nearby was Colby Wollack , who VBD he definitely considers himself a believer . "" There 's too much NN out there , and there 's so much evidence , "" he VBD . His wife , Monica Fortenberry , MD n't VB but crack a smile . She was skeptical . "" There 's just no NN that there is something of this size out in the woods anywhere , "" she VBD . "" It 's either a bear , or it 's not . "" Between them was Monica 's brother , Montgomery . He does n't quite VB in NNP — the evidence did n't convince him — but VBD he considers himself an "" enthusiast . "" "" I VBP it 's a great hobby and I VBP NNS should keep doing it whether they VBP in it or not , "" he VBD . "" I VBP the idea of it , RB if it 's never proven . I VBP it 's still a good story . "" In the afternoon , throngs of festivalgoers regrouped on the courthouse lawn for what organizers dubbed a "" town hall . "" But instead of discussing municipal issues , CD NNP believer after another stood up to share stories of their encounters . CD NN mentioned seeing an aging NNP whose fur was graying . Another shared an account of seeing a female NNP and her baby dash into the woods at RB 30 mph . Multiple NNS mentioned "" yellow eyes "" and a foul odor akin to the scent of a dead NN . Still others described hearing a roar . "" It was n't a growl and it was n't a scream , "" CD NN VBD . "" More IN a guttural , gibberish thing . "" "" You 're looking at something that do n't exist , "" VBD a NN from Virginia . A few folks who shared their stories VBD it took NNS for them to screw up the courage to tell anyone about their NNP sightings for fear of appearing "" crazy . "" "" But I VBP what I heard , "" a woman told the crowd . "" I VBP what I smelled , and I VBP how it made me feel . "" The lawn was a judgment - free zone . JJ NNS in the crowd wore T - shirts professing their faith in NNP 's existence . "" Gone Squatchin , "" some shirts VBD ( Yes , that 's a verb , as in : to "" squatch , "" the act of looking for NNP ) . Some declared NNP the Hide and Seek NNP Champion , while others flipped the tables , saying , "" NNP saw me but nobody believes him . "" Still others bore a simple directive : "" VB . "" But when CD NN stood up to share his story and asked how JJ believers were in the crowd , only about half raised their hands . JJ of the NNS VBD they are VBN to doubters , and it does n't necessarily bother them . "" I totally respect their opinions , "" Bruner VBD . "" I respect the fact that they do n't VB , and I just VBP them to respect the fact that I do . "" Other NNS VBD they encourage skeptics to VB out into the woods and search for evidence themselves , because they 'll never find it on a computer . CD NNP researcher , Daniel Hurst , VBD he appreciates skeptics because they force him to be diligent in his work . "" They 're a very positive thing for us , actually , "" he VBD , raising his voice to combat the sound of a generator fired up nearby . "" For those of us who are in the business for legitimacy , ( skeptics ) keep us honest . "" CD group of non-believers VBD they were just at the festival to have a good NN and to enjoy the NN of NNS who were passionate about something . That was something they MD appreciate , they VBD . As recordings of purported NNP calls bellowed from the evidence tent , Micah Loving explained he 's a fan of the mystery of NNP and understands why the NNS are excited . But mainly , he VBD , squatchin ' is something fun to do with your friends . "" You drink beers and you have fun and you might hear something and you might scream out into the woods and VB a reaction maybe from some other NN — most likely not a NNP — but it 's tons of fun and it's just the whole hunt , "" he VBD . Loving and his friends had just been to the evidence tents and VBD they were n't persuaded by anything they saw .

While that is certainly the NN , the movie does more than take liberties with the NNP : “ Noah ” pushes messages that have nothing to do with the NNP . These messages are actually political and come directly from the NN elite . The primary message ? Humanity needs to be cleansed … again . Throughout his movie - making career , Darren Aronofsky has created quite a few controversial movies with a powerful underlying message ( VB my article on the movie Black Swan here ) . None of his work can be considered “ idiotic ” and , despite what critics VBP , Noah is not an idiotic movie either . Sure , it contains JJ stone monsters , primitive bazookas and Noah killing a bunch of poor souls , but the movie is smart enough to effectively communicate several of its core messages , twisting CD of the oldest tales in the NN to push an agenda that is very 2014 . While JJ viewers were upset about the JJ liberties taken in this retelling of Noah ’s Ark – a tale that exists in Jewish , Christian , and Muslim literature – the messages added to the story should be RB more upsetting . Noah re-formats this ancient tale to describe the basic premise of a JJ religion , CD that has been pushed on the masses for NNS . VBN on the elite ’s JJ - term Agenda of drastically depopulating the NNP , this JJ religion is about radical environmentalism , the devaluation ( and RB hatred ) of JJ NN , and the re-alignment of morality towards a JJ axis . Through its odd narrative , the movie turns the tale of Noah ’s Ark into an absurd and disturbing adventure that leads viewers wondering : Why is NNP so evil ? And why is Noah such a jerk ? When Noah ’s wife asks him if “ the Creator ” ( that ’s the name for NNP in the movie ) will VB them survive , Noah ’s answer is almost comedic , as if he was describing a super - villain : While the NNP explains that the Great Flood was caused by a mysterious race of Giants corrupting and “ infecting ” humanity , the movie does not VB that route . Instead , it repeatedly tells us that NNS are evil and deserve to die . Before getting into the actual story , I need to point out a detail that is seemingly trivial , but that tells loads about the movie ’s true goal : Why is everybody dressed as if they got their clothes from the NN ’s JJ Zara NN ? These made - for - a- 2014 - audience outfits basically tell us that Noah is not about the NNP – it is about today . It is a message to humanity RB now , directly from the elite . While the premise of Noah is VBN on the Biblical story from the book of Genesis , the creators invented characters , subplots , symbols , images , and messages to completely reshape the tale , giving it a twisted , disturbing and wholly “ unspiritual ” meaning . RB if PRP watches the movie fully expecting a “ creative retelling ” of Noah ’s Ark , it is difficult to not be disturbed by the bloody , violent , near - psychopathic tangent taken by the main character . I mean , Noah actually kills a bunch of NNS in the movie ! How can that remotely VB sense in the divine context of the story ? Well , it actually does VB sense … when we understand that the movie is meant to sell a JJ religion dictated by the NN elite composed of values it wants the masses to adopt . CD of these values is that JJ NN is cancer on NNP that needs to be eradicated . In other words , they VBP NNS to sincerely VB they are evil to justify depopulation . Of course , as the movie tells us , most NNS do die … EXCEPT those of the chosen bloodline . And that is what the elite wants us to VB . We must all die to save the NNP … except them . Noah is strikingly similar to another movie analyzed on Vigilant Citizen : 2012 . As I noted in this article , 2012 is a disaster movie that is essentially about the rich and powerful NNS ( the elite ) surviving a gigantic flood while everyone else dies . The movie was full of references to the tale of Noah ’s Ark and RB shows helicopters transporting various NNS to JJ ships . The movie posters of Noah and 2012 are RB strikingly similar . Noah is , therefore , a reconstitution of a biblical story tailor - made to fit the Agenda continually being pushed by the elite … and as usual , the Agenda is rather upsetting . It promotes the idea of massively depopulating the NNP and sells it as an ecological mission . Extreme environmentalism is the JJ religion being sold to the masses through fear . This religion is not only promoted in works of fiction , it is VBN in real NN monuments . The Georgia Guidestones is a gigantic collection of stones ( dubbed NNP ’s Stonehenge ) on which are laid out ten JJ commandments . In the article I wrote about the Guidestones , I explain that it was built by members of occult secret societies . The last commandment of the stones sums up the main message of the movie Noah : In Noah , it is explained that humanity needs to be extinct because it is disrespectful to nature . That is not what is VBN in the NNP , but that is the message this movie ( and the elite ) wants you to absorb . RB from the JJ scenes of the movie , Noah ( dressed in his little Zara outfit ) talks to his kids about hardcore JJ concepts that were probably the last thing on NNS ’s minds in these very ancient times . When Noah ’s son sees a pretty flower and tries to pick it , Noah jumps in to stop the senseless destruction . That little scene announces Noah ’s rather extreme brand of environmentalism . A little later , Noah sees “ NNS ” ( a pejorative term in the movie ) hunting an NN in order to eat it . Noah runs to the rescue of the NN and stabs CD of the NNS in the leg . He then calls his act of violence “ justice ” . Yes , Noah is apparently an extreme vegan who stabs NNS who eat meat . When Noah ’s son asks him why these evil NNS VBP that eating meat gives them strength , he replies : This , of course , is not VBN in the NNP . It is part of the movie ’s message that basically VBZ “ NNS > NNS ” . Throughout the movie , Noah refers to NNS as “ the innocent ” while NNS are perceived as scum who deserve to die . Noah , however , seems to forget that JJ NNS are carnivorous beasts who spend most of their NN hunting and devouring other NNS . Some might VB : That is what NNP intended . At CD point Noah tells his NNS : Throughout the movie , Noah , the “ hero of the movie ” displays absolute hatred for humanity and avoids it at all costs . Every NN he sees “ NNS ” or man-created structures , he automatically becomes worried . Twisting the Biblical Bit About the Giants To further its anti-humanity message , the movie significantly twists and contorts Biblical passages about a mysterious race called the Giants VBN in the book of Genesis . In the NNP , the Giants are offsprings of a group of 200 “ Sons of NNP ” who descended to NNP to mix with NNS . They are VBN to have taught NNS advanced skills such as metallurgy , metal working , cosmetics , sorcery , astrology , astronomy , and meteorology . Because the Giants disobeyed NNP , they were RB called the Fallen Angels . ( Interesting note : Lucifer is RB referred to as a Fallen Angel and is VBN to have brought forbidden knowledge to NNS ) . In the book of Genesis , it is VBN that the Giants ( RB called the Nephilim ) were a hybrid race of sons of NNP and JJ females . The Nephilim are described in the NNP ( and other apocryphal texts ) as a race of giants who lived among NNS . They ultimately became a destructive presence and were VBN to have consumed “ all acquisitions of NNS ” . In order to rid these beings from NNP ( along with the NNS who mixed with them ) NNP caused the Great Flood . The NNP , therefore , describes the Giants as the main NN of humanity ’s corruption . The movie , however , portrays the exact opposite . In Noah , the Giants are described as gentle teachers who came to aid NNS , but ultimately became victims of humanity ’s cruelty . Later , Giants actually VBP Noah build the Ark ! In short , the movie inverted important parts of the NNP to VB that humanity is solely responsible for its demise because it had evolved into a NN that was beyond repair . The movie RB makes it clear that its anti-humanity message is still applicable today . In CD significant part of the movie , Noah tells his family the “ JJ story he ever heard ” . It begins with the JJ line of the NNP “ In the beginning , there was light ” but then devolves into a grim speech about the evils of humanity . The movie , therefore , pushes the viewers to conclude that humanity is , once again , beyond hope . Massive depopulation is therefore not a horrible catastrophe but a necessary “ cleansing process ” . Noah himself VBZ : This line is not from the NNP . It comes from the minds of psychopaths who VBP to depopulate the NNP and describing it as a “ cleansing process ” . Depopulation is good . Death equals cleansing . In the end , Noah realizes that not all humanity needs to die after the flood : His family survives . And there lies another important message of the movie : Depopulation does not apply to all humanity . It only applies to those who are not part of the “ chosen ” bloodline . This is the kind of the message the occult elite wants us to assimilate because they VBP THEY are the chosen bloodline . It ’s All About the Bloodline Spoiler alert : Noah and his family survive the Great Flood . But no NN else does . RB from the beginning of the movie , we are told that the survival of humanity must VB through a specific bloodline . Viewers immediately learn that Noah descends from Seth while the bad guys descend from Cain – a fact that is apparently VERY important . Of course , none of this is mentioned in the NNP . It is CD of the JJ fabrications added to flesh out the story and to give it a specific angle : NNP favors a specific bloodline . Later in the movie , Noah ’s father , Methuselah , is depicted as a reclusive but supernatural being who magically guides Noah through the Creator ’s plan . While Methuselah was never mentioned in the NNP as having a role in the construction of the Ark , this addition strengthens the idea of the bloodline . There are other strange “ non-Biblical ” additions to the movie that ultimately makes us VB that Noah is not a “ NN of NNP ” , but a jerk who only wants to VB his bloodline survive . For instance : Noah actually kills a bunch of NNS . In another gut - wrenching ( and completely invented ) scene , Noah purposely allows his son ’s girlfriend to be trampled to death by hundreds of NNS . How can a NN , that is supposedly chosen by the Creator , allow the death of an innocent girl ? Why was this added to the movie ? Because it is continuously communicating a message : Whether she was good or not is irrelevant . The girl was not part of the bloodline . Therefore , she must die . It is not about being a good NN . It is about who you descend from . After the flood , Noah turns into a disturbed , depressive , psychopath . When he learns that his daughter - in - law is pregnant , he is convinced that he must kill the little girl to VB sure that humanity does not reproduce . Noah , however , realizes something incredible : He does not feel IN stabbing his own granddaughter in the face . Although he RB believes that he had let down the Creator by not killing the girl , he ultimately learns that he did the JJ thing by “ showing mercy ” . But what about the countless NNS he killed ? Was n’t there any mercy for them ? No . Because they were not part of the bloodline . The Creator allowed Noah to murder NNS when they were not “ chosen ” . Incidentally , that is what the occult elite believes . The movie depicts Noah ’s “ divine ” quest as a cruel and violent process carried out by a NN who is steadily turning into a psychopath . While stranded on the Ark , his own family begins to resent him as he obsesses over the fact that everybody needs to die . While he is merely following the Creator ’s orders , he appears to be animated by a deep - seeded hate of humanity , which leaves viewers with an “ unholy ” feeling . There is , however , a character that counterbalances Noah ’s “ do it my NN or else ” doctrine : Tubal - Cain . Tubal - Cain is the “ leader of NNS ” , and , therefore , Noah ’s mortal enemy . While Tubal - Cain is the “ bad guy ” , he is ironically the character who VBZ the most thoughtful and sensible lines , which causes viewers to somewhat identify with him . Contrarily to Noah , he is not ashamed to be JJ and is proud of humanity ’s accomplishments . Furthermore , he feels somewhat forsaken by the Creator who left his kind to roam a desolate NN . He seeks to emancipate himself from the Creator ’s rule through his own means . In this sense , he is a representative of a Gnostic point of view that perceives the Creator a demiurge – a lower NN who imprisoned mankind in a material NN . This is why NNP is called “ the Creator ” in the movie . It refers to the Gnostic concept of demiurge , the near - malevolent creator of the material NN . Tubal - Cain is briefly mentioned in the NNP as a “ forger of all instruments of bronze and iron ” and an “ instructor of every artificer in brass and iron ” . However , he is never mentioned in the story of the Great Flood and has no link with Noah . So why did the makers of the movie choose this obscure Biblical character to become Noah ’s arch - nemesis ? Because , while Tubal - Cain is an obscure figure in the NNP , he is an extremely important figure in the most widespread Gnostic Mystery School on NNP : Freemasonry . Not unlike Hiram Abiff ( a leading figure in Masonic lore and ritual ) , Tubal - Cain is an obscure Biblical figure who takes a great importance in esoteric teachings . As a proficient maker of weapons , he represents humanity ’s potential to build its own NN – without the Creator . Various Masonic sources describe the esoteric significance of Tubal - Cain . In Manly P. Hall ’s “ The Lost Keys of Freemasonry ” , Tubal - Cain is described as the “ forefather ” of Freemasons . Mystery Schools love Biblical characters who did not rely on NNP to gain knowledge and NN . Tubal - Cain is a prime example . In Noah , Tubal - Cain attempts to communicate with the Creator – not as a servant , IN Noah , but as an equal . Although Tubal - Cain realizes that humanity is about to be wiped away , he finds an unexpected NN to carry on his legacy : Noah ’s own son , Ham . Throughout Noah ’s quest , Ham feels ignored , rejected and infantilized . He feels that he cannot become a NN without being with a woman – a NN that is denied by his father . Tired of being punished and humiliated , Ham leaves the Ark and mixes with the “ nasty ” NNS . There , he finds a “ good girl ” he wants to marry . However , Noah leaves her to die and drags Ham back to the Ark by force . When Ham meets Tubal - Cain , he finds the kind of father figure he has been looking for . Instead of a NN of blind servitude , Tubal - Cain offered Ham the means to be a “ real ” NN . During the flood , Tubal - Cain VBD a NN to sneak inside the Ark and , while hidden with the NNS , he “ initiated ” Ham to his philosophy . While these words were VBN by the “ bad guy ” , he was nearly quoting actual Biblical verses . This only adds to the movie ’s general confusion and mixed messages . Tubal - Cain then ultimately urges Ham to kill his father : Ham does not kill his father … he kills Tubal - Cain . However , this fateful act does not seem to bother Tubal - Cain . To the contrary , he knows that , by killing him , Ham has successfully completed his initiation . While dying , Tubal - Cain tells Ham : After surviving the flood , Ham does not reintegrate with Noah ’s family . He leaves them behind and makes his own path . We do n’t VB if Ham managed to reproduce ( probably not ) . However , we do VB that , in the NNP , the story that immediately follows Noah ’s Ark is the story of the Tower of Babel – a gigantic tower built by NNS to “ fight NNP ” . It appears that the Great Flood did not “ cleanse ” anything and that Tubal - Cain ’s lineage survived the Flood after all . In the NNP , the story of Noah ’s Ark is told in a few simple verses and is filled with enigmatic bits that are never explained ( i.e. who were the Giants exactly ? ) . The movie Noah fills in the answers to some of these questions in its own NN by augmenting the Biblical tale with fabricated stories and characters , ultimately giving this ancient story a very modern twist . The same NN Russell Crowe ’s snazzy outfits were tailor - made for a 2014 audience , the messages in Noah were RB tailor - made for a 2014 audience . The movie basically presents CD philosophical views : CD that is meant for the ignorant masses and CD that is meant for “ those in the NN ” . The ignorant masses are told to follow a radical brand of environmentalism that leads to self - hatred : Because humanity is the evil force behind NN , suffering and the destruction of nature , it needs to be “ cleansed ” . This message fits with the occult elite ’s depopulation Agenda and is embodied by Noah . At the other end of the spectrum , Tubal - Cain represents NNS seeking godhood , acquiring the physical and mental tools to reach the same status as the Creator . This is the Gnostic philosophy adopted by the occult elite . While embodied by the “ bad guy ” , it is nevertheless presented as an alternative to the absurdity of the Creator who created humanity to then destroy it . In short , Noah is far from an “ idiotic ” movie ( as some reviewers have stated ) . It manages to sell a NNP Age religion VBN on self - hatred while giving a nod to the occult elite , those who fancy themselves to be descendants of Tubal - Cain . But the occult elite does not VB in radical environmentalism OR care about JJ NN . They are the ones behind all our major wars and their greed is the main NN of nature ’s destruction . Through movie ’s IN Noah , they are trying to put the burden of their own wrongdoings on the unsuspecting masses who RB do as they are told . They VBP us to welcome the idea of a “ great cleansing ” . In the NNP , after the Great Flood , NNP himself VBZ : So , whether you VBP in the NNP or not , VB that if there is another major “ cleansing ” on NNP , it will not come from “ the Creator ” . It will come from those who have brainwashed you for NNS , convincing you to VB you are a cancer on NNP ."

I marked it out on a piece of plywood in a very simple NN ; Just made an  18  of the appropriate size on a sheet of paper IN this : Then cut a square meter of plywood ; set the paper template on it and poked through each of the 18 points in turn using a bradawl before moving the paper on to its next position until all seven  18s were marked with little holes on the plywood : I then stuck a tiny TB to each point using contact adhesive and it was done . As I was positioning the final few mini-TBs ; a fresh blustery wind started blowing and Sylphs began to appear in numbers . At dusk ; three small lenticular clouds appeared in the sky RB above the 108 but it was already too dark to take a photograph . Today the Sylphs arrived again in numbers and we RB had a visit from a black helicopter IN midday . As night falls once more ; the sky is filled with unseasonal rainclouds .. The individual TBs are no bigger than a bottle - top and yet the sum total appears to be profoundly positive . Dan . Good job , Carolien -- I 'm blown away by the quality of the work ! My patterns are kind of crude by comparison . Our business was under radionics assault a month RB , characterized by sharply , suddenly dwindled orders . On the day when I set up a 108 the orders started coming in as before and stayed steady until a week RB , when I delivered that 108 to Dooney and Steve . Then the orders dwindled again , for Carol and I . I 'm waiting for some feedback from Dooney and Stevo , since they are RB under constant radionics assault . The other business NN , besides Carolien , who is particularly targetted that NN is Andy Schwarm of ctbusters.com . I 'm not happy that we 're being perpetually smacked by the NNP and NSA this NN but I 'm glad nobody else among our associates evidently is . I 'm making another pattern , now , and will VB some trick , conical orgonite bits for each of the 108 points . I 'll VB TBs sort of IN Andy's , this NN , and will add nice crystals and spiral coils inside . Cones and pyramids have almost equal NN dynamics , evidently , and I bet the cone NN will RB blast out . I do n't mind the lull in business , much , because I had n't been able to VB ahead with production , so my personal NN was suffering . I 'm definitely NOT a workaholic . It 's still early to VB any claims for this device , which was invented by Cesco , VBN perhaps on Kelly 's earlier field experiments . Promoting it is a little bit dicey because Cesco has n't mentioned whether he favors others profitting from this intellectual property . RB , when he was last here , a NN and a half RB , he was uncertain whether an identical orgonite piece should VB in the center of each of the seven hexagram ' NNS , ' which MD VB the number , 115 rather than 108 . Just because Carol and I RB RB gave away the plans for orgonite cloudbbusters , the Succor Punch , Powerwand , the NNP Secret , Holy Handgrenades and Towerbusters does n't mean that it 's appropriate for other inventors to give away their creations , of course . I 'm sure not giving away the formulas for the ' secret ingredients ' of our own commercial offerings , after allbecause we VBP to keep a competitive edge and there is always more than CD NN to accomplish anything . That VBN , I 'd be very pleased if it 's appropriate for Carolien to VB these beautiful templates and perhaps the orgonite that goes on them . Since the orgonite is interactive I VBP it MD be productive to boost it with gems , coils , etc. , in an intelligent NN . The only NN to VB a good idea of the device 's parameters is to VB a whole lot of them in the hands of NNS who are in a position to give substantive feedback . That 's how we test our own mods before we decide to VB them . ~Don In last weeks chat , Don mentioned that he had made a small 108 ( a little over a square meter ) to stop radionics on his biz and was making some more to VB out Stevo , Dooney and others . Radionics are often VBN to put a dome over our businesses , to VB them invisible for customers . Frequently we boost each others biz to clear these etheric fogs . I MD n't wait to VB my own 108 and started the next day making a template on paper , using the picture Cesco once posted on EW ( enlarged 6 times for the square meter endresult ) : VB picture on whale . to page : http://www.whale.to/b/108_h.html_ADD However , taping the twentyfour pages together into CD print , turned out rather messy . Despite my tongue in cheek effort , the circle became all crooked . Using my compasses to draw the 108 on another sheet , left me with a buzzing headache of all the measurements . I sure lost my touch with maths ! So in the end , I gave myself a break and ordered a weatherproof outdoor poster of the 108 template on pvc sheet . This Dutch NN makes a 110x110 cm sheet for about 108 euroA perfect size for using half size tb's with 5 cm diameter . It is quite easy ( and cheaper ) to have CD made by a NN in your own NN - just look for vinyl outdoor poster / banner sellers on the Internet , there are lots ! JJ outdoor poster sellers have a download option for your own picture on a banner . All you have to do is : 1 ) download the 108 picture on http://www.whale.to/b/108_h.html_ADD 2 ) enlarge it 6 times on your own computer ( to VB the approximate square meter ) 3 ) and order a banner at the size to fit the enlarged templateHere is my finished 108 - well , almost finished , I had to VB CD more small tb ... It is too soon to tell wether it is RB working against the radionics on my biz . It has n't been up for a day yet . But for what it 's worth : my computer screen stopped flickering for the JJ NN in a NN ( I had grown accustomed to that flickering ! Thought it was due to JJ age . Hopefully it does n't start tomorrow again , hehe ) . Physically , I felt my NNS charka burning healthy unlike I have experienced in over a NN too . So far , so good . I will report more in NN . It MD be my pleasure to order a template for EW members . Since we all are radionics targets , our observations might be worthwhile . Please PM me for that . Carolien These are essentially simple geometrical patterns , VBN on hexagonal partitions of circles . Some NNS regard these geometries as sacred . The idea for the 108 was RB proposed and tested by Cesco of matheriaetherica.com In the meantime a few etheric warriors have started trying them out . The good thing about the orgone network is that we always have a phase of testing by different orgonistas with different sensitivities . After all we do n't VB to promote NNS or ideas just on hearsay . Sometimes this MD be seen as a slow down when someone is very excited about a JJ discovery or perception , but it guarantees that we 're not falling for the trap of becoming self proclaimed JJ age gurus who try to VB a cult out of their particular sensitivity or perception . Our friend Manfred Hotwagner has started the etheric research forum The question in this test MD be if the sum of all parts in this arrangement is doing more than the parts on their own , namely 108 TBs . We are pretty familiar with what 108 TBs do on their own , as we always have a few 100 on our premises . Friederike lovingly waterclolouring the design Of course there is a strong and somewhat founded suspicion that certain geometries or shapes have particular NN signatures . After all , ancient traditions have put great emphasis on the NN of sacred geometry . But we do n't just VB to jump onto the JJ age bandwagon and VB prematurely very excited . We leave that to the wannabe Gurus , ok ? The final kick to overcome my natural inertia and VB busy with this experiment came from the feedback that some of the JJ experimentors gave : The NN of this setup is appartently very strong and MD give extended protection against all kinds of etheric interference . Since we are constantly aware of such interference being directed at us , it was a no brainer to VB us started . Georg sticking them on And after sticking them on and putting the board upright , just standing in front of it , I must VB : Wow ! Wow , I have never felt anything IN it ! In a NN it felt IN being hit by direct sunlight , but much more pleasant and energising . ( and sunlight is already pleasant , I VBP ) But this light does not stay on the NN of your NN , it goes RB through , embracing all molecules of your NN . The whole NN feels lit up and energized . RB there is a sensation of a very high frequency sound , but it 's not in the ear . We have hung it on the wall of our kitchen which serves as our dinng room as well . Whenever I walk past it , I feel compelled to stand in front of it and spead the arms in order to soak up that NN . The night after it was finished , I went into the EW chat and asked the psychics if they MD pick up some interference on our business , because I had a week with very low orders and it felt IN CD of the usual radionics blockades we so frequently have to put up with . The feedback I got from Axel that evening was , that the NN of the JJ 108 is so strong , it has already blasted away all interference . Finished and klaar then as we VBP in NNP Africa ? A day later I went to visit our highly psychic friend Valda and on just telling her about it , she MD tune into the NN and confirmed that it 's extremely powerful .

I MD VB to report that my opinion has been modified somewhat in the light of more recent experience with the device . Following my initial glowing impressions of its effects ( mostly on the sky ) ; I began to notice a number of more negative changes in the area . The sky became hazy and cloudless and the wind dropped ; rather in the NN it does during a concerted chemtrail attack ( but there were no chemtrails ) and the Sylphs completely disappeared . We each began to exhibit classic NNS of the effects of DOR ( headaches , poor sleep patterns , listlessness and lack of inspiration ) all highly unusual given the quantity of orgonite in the area . It was almost as though the three CBs in my garden had all stopped working in unison . After a few days ; my suspicions fell on the wonderful 108 that everyone ( myself included ) was raving about . Id assembled it with meticulous precision from small pieces of simple orgonite so there MD be nothing wrong with the stone - combinations or coils as there were none ( RB the drawing was both correct and accurately drafted ) . The easy NN to find out was to simply take it away from its then horizontal position ( where the NN vortex was presumably effecting the sky ) and stand it upright against the workshop wall . Almost immediately the gentle breeze returned and the sky slowly cleared and it seemed that the CBs were beginning to work normally again . The subjective negative effects on each of us continued though and Id find myself staring into NN when there were things to be done ; apparently lost for an idea . Finally I dismantled the 108 and put the component pieces away . All the negative effects evaporated and the area returned to normal ( and has remained this NN ever since ) . As I VBP ; I do not VB where to attribute the source of this negativity ; given the wholesale endorsement of the 108 by a range of experienced orgonite experimenters , some of whom have posted in this thread . The only other 108 I ever made was constructed from lawn - busters  ( orgonite spikes that are trodden into soft ground ) . Each spike of orgonite contained a Cesco coil and a quartz chip and I set them in the NN ( EP - style ) with a hammer . On that occasion ; I remember a fresh blustery breeze starting as I had nearly completed the arrangement and initial good effects on the atmosphere . For some reason I became disaffected with that initial 108 and eventually dug it out of the ground and threw the pieces in the Bali Strait on a trip to Java . I didnt suspect the integrity of the 108 matrix at that NN and just assumed that there must have been a conflict between so JJ coils set in close proximity to each other . I do not pretend to understand these negative effects of the 108 and I realize that this is not the JJ NN that my findings have been completely at odds with the general consensus on this forum . I hope that others do not experience anything similar and that the 108 continues to VB rave reviews . I MD however be dishonest if I allowed my earlier impressions of the device to stand uncorrected . Dan . Kelly has reminded me that this is not his invention , by the NN . I VBP I was giving the impression that it is . This is Cesco 's tentative presentation and Kelly has gone on to experiment with a 114 arrangement . So far , we 've had nothing but good experiences with ours , as have Dooney and STevo and CD or CD others . We looked closely at your problem in Dooney 's chatroom , yesterday , and focused mainly on the unhappy entity that Kelly VBD on / under your property . Stevo evidently got into a dialog with this NN and all the psychics had the impression that the entity is an elemental who is extremely displeased with the NN order 's manipulation and sabotage of Bali 's NN field , RB not able or willing to distinguish that from your own engineering . Francie , early on , clearly saw a witch NN looking closely at you these days and that CD is probably associated with the elemental & anxious about the technology you 're using . Bali is the only island in that enormous archipelago , as far as I VBP , whose inhabitants have mostly held to the older ways and did n't embrace Islam when Arab merchants and scholars went there so JJ centuries RB . I VBP it was only the Turks and perhaps Moghuls who forced conversion to Islam , which was very much against Muhammad 's teachings . The style of Hinduism in Bali seems to me IN the more ancient animism that we VBP in Tibetan Buddhism and Shintoism , which MD be to VB that the ' older ways ' involve close cooperation with elementals . A nice confirmation of that MD be the NN that the Shinto priests whom Tetsuzi - san met were eager to accept his orgonite gifts for their shrine / vortex ; they immediately understood the NN and its uses . Stevo evidently worked out a deal with your elemental room mate to let you reassemble the 108 and keep it VBG for three months , if you 're willing . He promised not to interfere during that NN while he evaluates it . We had an awful lot of fun in that chat session , by the NN . Francie 's past exposure to Jesuits at college in Georgetown produced some Jesuit predators in a murder ritual , which we RB dealt with in the session . I had a notion to ' offer ' these child - murderers to that elemental on your property as a gift and Stevo VBD he accepted . We expressed our love to the elemental who the psychics VBD was very surprised to find Westerners who honored him / her / it . We operate on the assumption that elementals are neither good nor bad but are certainly essential to all the workings of our NN . This is unspeakably weird to mainstream folks but when PRP is willing to loose the shackles of conventionality it 's a whole lot of fun and RB empowering to interact with elementals , most of whom love orgonite , after all . Your situation reminded me of the JJ elementals Carol and I encountered on Andros Island in the Bahamas , where we went to gift the blue holes . The Bahamians on that island have gotten pretty far from their African roots and are quite churchified , so they seem to hate and fear the elementals there . Carol immediately got the impression that they hated NNS on account of it but as soon as we started tossing orgonite out into the very dense bush for them , then into the blue holes over the next few days . I heard them as galloping horses , which did n't surprise me RB though you can't penetrate more than a few inches into that jungle without a bulldozer and they were obviously very happy that some NNS finally acknowledged them . I VBP the orgonite RB toned down the churchy NNS 's paranoia about these nature guardians , too . Your NN is absolutely unique , Dan , but I encourage you to avoid making assumptions about the devices and will rather consider the more hidden dynamics . We VBP to VB you resolve this . I VBP that if the problem were rather with the technology then we'd have heard reports IN this from other stable and reputable NNS but you 're the only NN so there 's obviously something else VBG on . Kelly did a great job identifying the source of your previous trouble and it might be useful for you to VB acquainted with some traditional magicians on Bali if the opportunity arises . If the JJ ways on Bali were not valid I doubt the NNS MD have kept those traditions into modern times and I VBP to honor NNS who do that . There are a few other cultures IN the NN who have achieved this . The Black Caribs ( Garifuna ) of Central NNP are CD and I VBD them quite endearing . There are lots of them in Africa and rural Asia where NNP Religion clergy have n't bludgeoned NNS into superstition and paranoia about natural forces . A witch NN in the mountains of NNP Thailand sent an emissary to VB instructions for making orgonite from Eddie - san when he was vacationing there a few NNS RB . They didnt ' VB each other and as far as I VBP Eddie has n't gotten any followup . I had the opportunity to receive a lot of similar stories / teachings from Dorothy the Witch , who was CD of a 3,000 NN family line of witches from Wales and perhaps a longer line of medicine NNS from the Seneca tribe . She has travelled to over 40 NNS in a synchronous NN and was sought out by members of ancient , benevolent secret orders in most of those . We MD learn a lot about synchronicity from folks IN these if we 're fortunate enough to VB them . A group of kindly witches gave protection to Carol and her associates when they arrived in rural Kenya 8 NNS RB and I VBP if it were n't for that , the malevolent ' night runners ' MD have harmed CD or more of them , then . This is the hidden NN which orgonite suits us to behold and appreciate if we 'll open ourselves to it . Some of us need to abandon certain prejudices in order to venture there , of course . ~ Don , Dan , we 're still in the exploratory phase with this device and I 'm kind of proud of the NN NNS are not getting carried away with blind imitation .

I VBP we 've come a JJ NN and it makes me very proud of everyone here . ~Don I didnt VBP to post about it prematurely , because VBG NN with observations often has its own dynamics , while temporarily disassembling the 108 was intended to pace myself in the process of understanding its possible interactions . RB , including the 108 in the reduction of possible outside influences  to check if all this was interference or perhaps some personal process  was a reluctant thing for me to do , for I was so curious about its possible effects in dissolving negative thoughtforms , as reported by Carol . Then Francie emailed an observation that swept me in doubt about the corruption resistance of a 108 and made me decide to temporarily remove it . I better post part of her email here as a quote , to not loose words in translation . I can already VB some occult geometry being put over your location .... I looked and saw this geometry again last night . As I approached the geometry it flashed and I saw bloody bulls ' horns and spring / early summer fields . I VBP that was the NN of this spell being made . I VBP biodynamic farmers still VBP the NN of the horns in their fields . What I saw over you MD be a corruption of this very JJ abundance / growth / fulfillment NN ritual . In previous observations , Francie and Bob had seen my sleep deprivations derive from astral projections during sleep . Part of me had been flying in the 108 vortex and somehow been captured , by the spell and my own lack of grounding ( thus the fear of VBG to sleep ) . Things felt a 100 % better and back to normal after Francie had removed this geometric overlay . But that left me in doubt whether this MD happen again , as you perhaps can understand . Anyhow , all this kick - started a serious commitment to exploring my own habits of thought and disciplining myself into more positive NN . As I VBD in the bugs post , it reminded me of experiencing George Orwells room 101 ( 1984  ) , where NNS are tortured with their own fears until they give up their concept of reality . After disassembling the 108 , the only outside influence left was my detox program . I need to add this and VBP more controversy  for this detox had a profound effect on my tendency to VB in negative circles . It convinced me that parasites have a role in maintaining negative thoughtforms , for which we blame our character . My 108 is up again . I feel strong enough to take more occult spells to test if they RB can corrupt a 108s NN or VB if I can manage myself now . As for the interaction , both Francie and Dooney saw my 108 more grounded now . Maybe its all part of a personal process , who knows ? This etheric NN leaves me flabbergasted all the NN . But thoughtforms seem to be very real ! Now I am curious how much happiness I can take Dan , I have to back you up to some extend  that is , Ive RB disassembled my 108 for a few weeks . Mainly because , at some point , there was too much VBG on ( as posted here and here ) for me to discern what caused what . Especially the thought - manifestation occurrences confused me . VB me , the amount of bugs manifesting was not funny and I felt IN a wicked witch for the NN my negative thoughts became instant reality to NNS IN me . So , besides disassembling the 108 I RB disconnected every SP and other possible thought - enhancing equipment in the NN  to gradually build things up again , CD by CD , and VB what MD happen . I didnt VBP to post about it prematurely , because VBG NN with observations often has its own dynamics , while temporarily disassembling the 108 was intended to pace myself in the process of understanding its possible interactions . RB , including the 108 in the reduction of possible outside influences  to check if all this was interference or perhaps some personal process  was a reluctant thing for me to do , for I was so curious about its possible effects in dissolving negative thoughtforms , as reported by Carol . Then Francie emailed an observation that swept me in doubt about the corruption resistance of a 108 and made me decide to temporarily remove it . I better post part of her email here as a quote , to not loose words in translation . In previous observations , Francie and Bob had seen my sleep deprivations derive from astral projections during sleep . Part of me had been flying in the 108 vortex and somehow been captured , by the spell and my own lack of grounding ( thus the fear of VBG to sleep ) . Things felt a 100 % better and back to normal after Francie had removed this geometric overlay . But that left me in doubt whether this MD happen again , as you perhaps can understand . Anyhow , all this kick - started a serious commitment to exploring my own habits of thought and disciplining myself into more positive NN .

When I RB released projections of 10,000 deaths in NNP by NNP 10th , nearly everyone thought the idea was insane ( probably including you ) . As it turns out , we are likely to have over 100,000 deaths by NNP 10th , according to what the White NNP is now saying . This is worth mentioning because today we have a JJ warning about where things are headed . There have been three unmistakable signs that NN is coming to the NNP NNPS very soon . Those signs have all emerged in the past week , all with a sense of urgency that goes far beyond any concern about a NN : Sign # 1 ) NNP NNP activating CD CD JJ reservists with JJ skills to treat battlefield injuries . Details of this order are VBN in the EO text at WhiteHouse.gov . Sign # 2 ) The Pentagon ordering high - level staffers into deep underground bunkers in Colorado . This was announced by NORAD and NORTHCOM in a NNP town hall meeting . Obviously , you do n’t order JJ staffers into a 2,000 - NN deep bunker just because of a NN . Sign # 3 ) Secretary of NNP Pompeo just ordered all Americans living overseas to return to the US “ immediately . ” The cover story for this is that the NN is collapsing international flights . But that alone MD not justify all Americans returning from living overseas , since JJ Americans MD just hunker down where they ’re living . But Pompeo wants all Americans to return immediately , which is the kind of thing you do before a NN breaks out ( with China , most likely ) . Via The UK Independent : Secretary of NNP Mike Pompeo urged Americans abroad who still wish to return to the NNP NNPS to do so “ immediately , ” saying commercial and NN - chartered flights MD soon cease amid the NN outbreak . Donald NNP ’s top diplomat urged any Americans abroad who VBP to VB back to US NN to contact the JJ embassy in the NN where they currently are to begin making plans “ immediately ” to VB a flight back to the NNPS . That ’s because Pompeo does n’t VB to end up negotiating for the release of JJ prisoners being held by the communist Chinese regime , obviously . Any JJ reading this who is still in China or Hong Kong should strongly consider bugging out . By the NN , we were RB told weeks RB from another source that China has already begun executing anti-communist leaders in Hong Kong , which now seems to be preparation for the JJ NN that ’s about to happen next . These three events are unmistakable signs that high - level officials within the Pentagon and US NNP Department anticipate actions of NN in the very near future . China is the most likely adversary , especially given that China probably released the Wuhan NN in the JJ place , knowing that NNP MD have a much more difficult NN locking down cities compared to China itself , which we now VBP MD have lost millions of citizens despite its best efforts to contain the NN . Notably , the Wuhan NN , released by China , has managed to cripple the US Navy by infecting sailors on aircraft carriers and other vessels . This is not an accident . It ’s part of the “ softening up ” phase to weaken NNP in advance of the attack . Expect an attack on NNP when the nation reaches “ peak NN ” NN chaos and JJ disruptions The ideal NN for a foreign enemy to attack the NNP NNPS MD be when our nation is in the throes of JJ collapse and a NN JJ emergency . According to estimates announced by the White NNP today , NN - related deaths will peak in the USA on April 12th , but lockdowns will continue through the end of April , causing JJ reverberations to echo across the nation for JJ months yet to come . The White NNP currently expects up to 240,000 Americans to die from the NN over the next several months . ( Our own estimates top out at just 90,000 fatalities , by the NN . ) Due to the NN crunch , joblessness , homelessness and rising JJ unrest will sow chaos across the landscape of NNP for the remainder of the NN ( and well into 2021 ) , and that does n’t RB count whatever political chaos might be added to the mix surrounding the coming November elections . Plus , there are food shortages that are starting to become very real , while a massive wave of price inflation for consumer goods will appear soon thanks to the trillions of dollars in bailout NN that NNP and the Fed just threw at the NN . With CD - third of the US Congress now run by communist China — and most of the left - wing NN making excuses for China and trying to shift the NN blame to NNP — it ’s clear that China ’s longstanding desire to infiltrate and destroy the NNP NNPS of NNP has reached a tipping point . They will likely pull the trigger soon , which MD mean JJ warfare ( selling all US debt and announcing a JJ gold - backed NN reserve currency ) , kinetic warfare ( an actual NN invasion of Chinese troops hitting the beaches in California ) , nuclear warfare ( or an EMP weapon detonated above NNP NNP ) , or RB JJ waves of biological warfare ( NNP - NNP - 3 , NNP - NNP - 4 , etc. ) . And do n’t forget cyber warfare , a favorite of the tech - savvy communist regime . We do n’t VB exactly what ’s coming , but we VBP the leadership in NNP believes something JJ is about to happen . Otherwise , none of the actions listed above MD have been taken . Ramp up your preparedness to a whole JJ level , if you can Prepare for all the following , just in NN CD or more happen : • A blackout of all internet and phone communications • Foreign troops invading the US , including through the Mexico border • Attempted assassination of NNP NNP , or a possible “ civil NN ” inside the Pentagon • The possibility of mass arrests of deep NN traitors who are Chinese collaborators , such as Sen. Feinstein , Gov. Newsom , etc . We cannot be certain that any of these will happen , and we hope none of them do . But there are JJ red flashing warning signs just screaming out that something JJ is about to VB down . The only CD scenarios that VBP sense are a NN with a foreign enemy or possibly the initiation of a domestic civil NN ( or perhaps both ) . If you thought encountering a purchase limit on toilet paper was the worst problem you might encounter this NN , VB again . JR Nyquist explains why China is just itching to destroy the NNP NNPS and has RB been planning to VB a biological weapon to soften up NNP in advance of the JJ attack wave : Share everywhere , and feel free to re-post this NN to your NNP channel :"

Thank_VBP you_PRP ._.","Sprite Argentina ( owned by The Coca - Cola NNP ) recently released on its JJ NN platforms an ad titled Orgullo ( translated to Pride ) which depicts several scenarios involving NNS and their gender dysphoric NNS dressing up as the opposite sex . Set to the emotional song You ’ll Never Walk Alone , the ad depicts the premature sexualization of NNS as a wholesome family activity . Here are some of the key scenes : The fact that we VBP this woman tightly strapping on this undergarment as emotional music plays in the background is odd . CD of the JJ reasons this is odd : Binding breasts leads to important NN risks . Binding for extended periods of NN can lead to rashes or yeast infections under the breasts , back or chest NN , shortness of breath , overheating , or fractured ribs . Unsafe binding MD lead to permanent deformation of the breasts , scarring , and lung constriction and JJ - term binding MD adversely affect the outcome of a future mastectomy . In CD NN , 97.2 % of those surveyed had some sort of NN problem caused by binding . – Wikipedia , “ Binding ” In another scene , there is more NN - tightening VBG on . In the 20th NN , corsets were deemed dangerous and “ instruments of female torture ” . This ad is not merely about “ pride ” or “ diversity ” , it is about pushing an agenda . It is about involving minors in it and shaming NNS who do not actively VB involved in it . An Agenda is Being Pushed The gender - blurring agenda has been identified on this NN several NNS RB and it keeps getting stronger . We VBP that there ’s an “ agenda ” ( which means “ an underlying often ideological plan or program ” ) VBG on because : • It is over - represented in mass NN • It is pushed by powerful actors • It targets minors ( and their NNS ) intentionally . Here are some recent examples : If you VBP that JJ corporations such as Coca - Cola create JJ ads because “ they care ” , you are dead wrong . They do n’t . They are pushing an agenda that was precisely calculated and thought - out by powerful NN tanks to VB and mold a JJ generation . What they are actually looking for is confusion , anxiety , insecurity and a general feeling of disconnection towards everything that is real . And they are succeeding . P.S.

According to the NNP Patriot NN GrayChampion . Com , by Joe Stack ’s piloting his plane into the Echelon Federal Building this past week he “ has fired the JJ shot in the NNP NNP Revolution . ” “ Gray Champion ’s are RB those rarest of Americans , arising to stand among their fellow citizens to “ do their duty ” on an average of once or twice every generation …. a NN that has come , once again , as the future of the NNP NNPS hangs in the balance . The true determination of who can be called a Gray Champion rests with history as these rarest of Americans were during their times , and by the actions they performed , were always labeled as terrorists , rebels , murderers and traitors and held up for scorn by the elite classes , NN officials and NN barons who were the targets of these Gray Champions in the JJ place . ” In our previous report about the actions of Joe Stack ( and actually when we had RB heard of the JJ moniker “ Gray Champion ” ) to strike back against a NN he believed no longer served the true interests of its citizens , we quoted from his “ manifesto ” delivered to the NNP upon his death , and wherein he VBD : “ I can only hope that the numbers quickly VBP too JJ to be white washed and ignored that the JJ zombies wake up and revolt ; it will take nothing less . I MD only hope that by striking a nerve that stimulates the inevitable double standard , knee - jerk NN reaction that results in more stupid draconian restrictions NNS wake up and begin to VB the pompous political thugs and their mindless minions for what they are . Sadly , though I spent my entire NN trying to VB it was n’t so , but violence not only is the answer , it is the only answer . The cruel joke is that the RB JJ chunks of shit at the top have VBN this all along and have been laughing , at and using this awareness against , fools IN me all along . ” To the fears of Joe Stack and his fellow JJ citizens of their living in a NN whose NN no longer serves them , but in chilling fact sees them all as enemies and has begun targeting them for destruction , the evidence is becoming overwhelming , and as we can read : As reported by the ABC Television NNP Service in their February 3rd article titled “ License to Kill ? Intelligence Chief VBZ U.S. Can Take Out JJ Terrorists ” they report : “ The director of national intelligence affirmed rather bluntly today that the U.S. intelligence community has authority to target JJ citizens for assassination if they present a direct terrorist threat to the NNP NNPS . “ We take direct actions against terrorists in the intelligence community ; if … we VBP that direct action will involve killing an NNP , we VBP specific permission to do that , ” Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair told the NNP Intelligence Committee . ” VBN upon US Intelligence Director Blair ’s testimony to Congress , and should the JJ NN had discovered Joe Stack ’s plan to attack the Echelon Federal Building in Texas , they had the NN to assassinate him instead of arresting him and bringing him to NN , and which flies in the face of every standard the NNP NNPS was built upon , not to mention its being against their own laws and Constitution . And it gets worse … In a just released report ( February 19th ) titled “ Bush Lawyer VBN NNP MD Order Civilians to Be ' Massacred ' ” by the JJ NN magazine Newsweek it is VBN : “ The chief author of the Bush administration 's "" torture memo ” told Justice Department investigators that the NN 's NN - making authority was so broad that he had the constitutional NN to order a village to be "" massacred ” , according to a report by released Friday night by the Office of Professional Responsibility . ” To those Americans believing that their NN MD never result to the wholesale massacring of them they are warned to VB twice , especially when viewed in the light of a just released article by the US Newswire Service titled “ 1,000 Architects & Engineers Call for NNP 9/11 Investigation ” and which , in part , VBZ : “ Richard Gage , AIA , architect and founder of the non-profit Architects & Engineers for 9/11 NNP , Inc. ( AE911 NNP ) , will announce a decisive milestone today at a press conference in San Francisco , as more than 1,000 worldwide architects and engineers now support the call for a JJ investigation into the destruction of the Twin Towers and Building 7 at the NNP Trade Center on September 11 , 2001 . After careful examination of the official explanation , along with the forensic NNS omitted from official reports , these professionals have concluded that a JJ independent investigation into these mysterious collapses is needed . Gage and his group base their conclusions on forensic evidence . Gage VBZ , "" The official FEMA and NIST reports provide insufficient , contradictory , and fraudulent accounts of the circumstances of the towers ' destruction . We are therefore calling for a grand jury investigation of NIST officials . Gage points out the destruction of the third high - rise , NNP Trade Center 7 , a 47 - story skyscraper which was not hit by an aircraft , yet came down in pure free - fall acceleration for more than 100 NNS , a significant fact that NIST has been forced to admit , due to research conducted by AE911 NNP petition signers . Other disturbing facts emerging from the forensic evidence include : Complete destruction of both Twin Towers in just 10 to 14 seconds at near free - fall acceleration Over 100 JJ - responder reports of explosions and flashes at onset of destruction 1200 - NN - dia . debris field : no "" pancaked "" floors seen in the debris pile Several tons of molten metal VBN in debris . Evidence of advanced explosive nano - thermitic composite material VBN in the WTC dust by an international NN of NNS ” RB worse for these Americans are those still believing that NNP Obama is VBG to protect them , but which all the evidence clearly shows he is not VBG to do , in fact , since taking office he has not only continued all of the JJ NNP Bush ’s policies , he is now actively involved in protecting from prosecution the Bush Administration “ architects ” of the JJ Fascist NN being created in the NNP NNPS along with continuing the cover -up of the events surrounding 9/11 , and as we can read : As reported by the Associated Press NNP Service in their article titled “ DOJ review finds no misconduct by memo authors ” , Obama overruled his own Department of Justice lawyers who wanted the Bush Administration authors of the so called “ torture memos ” prosecuted and has allowed them to VB unpunished , and as we can read : “ An initial review by the Justice Department 's internal affairs unit VBD that JJ [ Bush ] NN lawyers Jay Bybee and John Yoo had committed professional misconduct , a conclusion that MD have cost them their law licenses . But , underscoring just how controversial and legally thorny the memos have become , the Justice Department 's top career lawyer [ and close Obama friend ] reviewed the matter and disagreed . ” Scarier still about Obama are JJ reports coming from the US questioning weather he is RB in NN , and as we can read as reported by the Salon . Com NN Service in their report titled “ Who 's in NN in the White NNP ? ” , and which , in part , VBZ : “ Recall that CD NN RB , Obama instructed the DEA to follow his NN pledge and respect local statutes legalizing medicinal marijuana . When the DEA kept raiding pot dispensaries in NNS that had passed such laws , Attorney General Eric Holder reiterated the cease and desist decree , stating that "" What ( Obama ) VBD during the NN is now JJ policy . "" As RB more raids nonetheless continued , the Justice Department then issued an explicit memo ordering federal agents to refrain from prosecuting those who are in "" compliance with existing NN laws providing for the JJ NN of marijuana . "" And yet the DEA has recently intensified its crackdown . Here in Colorado -- where voters enshrined JJ marijuana 's legality in our NN constitution -- the feds not only raided CD dispensaries , but did so in a NN that deliberately humiliated their superiors . In January , the DEA stormed a NN that performs cannabis quality tests . The firm ’s alleged infraction ? Following protocol and formally applying for a federal equipment license . DEA rogues responded to the request not with thanks or -- heaven forbid -- approval , but instead with the gestapo . This was topped last week when DEA agents arrested a JJ marijuana grower who dared discuss his business with a local NN outlet . Sensing a P.R. opportunity , DEA agent Jeffrey Sweetin VBD the spectacle to insist that he will not listen to stand - down directives from his bosses . ” Now most interesting about all of these events now occurring in the NNP NNPS , including Joe Stack now being VBN to be CD of the “ Gray Champions ” of his generation , is that they have been predicted to occur , and as we can read as reported by the Wall Street Journal NNP Service in their December 29 , 2008 article titled “ As if Things Were n't Bad Enough , Russian Professor Predicts End of U.S. ” , and which VBZ : “ For a decade , Russian academic Igor Panarin has been predicting the U.S. will fall apart in 2010 . For most of that NN , he admits , few took his argument -- that an JJ and moral collapse will trigger a civil NN and the eventual breakup of the U.S. -- very seriously . Now he 's VBN an eager audience : Russian NN NN . In recent weeks , he 's been interviewed as much as twice a day about his predictions . "" It 's a record , "" VBZ Prof. Panarin . "" But I VBP the attention is VBG to grow RB stronger . "" Prof. Panarin , 50 NNS JJ , is not a fringe figure . A JJ KGB analyst , he is dean of the Russian Foreign Ministry 's academy for future diplomats . He is invited to Kremlin receptions , lectures students , publishes books , and appears in the NN as an expert on U.S. - NNP relations . But it's his bleak forecast for the U.S. that is music to the ears of the Kremlin , which in recent NNS has blamed Washington for everything from instability in the Middle East to the JJ JJ NN . Mr. Panarin's views RB fit neatly with the Kremlin 's narrative that NNP is returning to its rightful place on the NN stage after the weakness of the 1990s , when JJ feared that the NN MD VB economically and politically bankrupt and break into separate territories . A polite and cheerful NN with a buzz cut , Mr. Panarin insists he does not dislike Americans . But he warns that the outlook for them is dire . "" There 's a 55 - 45 % chance RB now that disintegration will occur , "" he VBZ . "" PRP MD rejoice in that process , "" he adds , poker - faced . "" But if we 're talking reasonably , it 's not the best scenario -- for NNP . "" Though NNP MD become more powerful on the JJ stage , he VBZ , its NN MD suffer because it currently depends heavily on the dollar and on trade with the U.S . Mr. Panarin posits , in brief , that mass immigration , JJ decline , and moral degradation will trigger a civil NN next fall and the collapse of the dollar . IN the end of June 2010 , or early July , he VBZ , the U.S. will break into six pieces -- with Alaska reverting to Russian NN . ” In these most darkest of times , and as the fate of NNP now hangs in the balance , PRP can only hope that her NNS will awaken , and in their awakening arise together , as the CD NNS that they are , so that when the history of these times are written , and though JJ of them will become their own “ Gray Champions ” , a JJ and better Nation MD be born again . © February 20 , 2010 NNP and US all rights reserved [ Ed .

Maybe_RB it_PRP migrated_VBD ?_.","Strange things are afoot in the NN kingdom . In Sweden , a 16 - inch “ Ratzilla ” burrowed into a family ’s home and terrorized them for weeks . In Canada , a CD - legged dog jogged down the beach as if it were a NN . Our sense of what is possible is expanding every day – MD the cryptids , those legendary monsters of folklore , have more grounding in scientific fact than previously assumed ? Probably not . But it ’s April Fools ’ Day , and that means we can have just as much fun fooling ourselves as we do other NNS . After all , the NN is a more interesting place with these creatures in it . Join us below as we explore the most intriguing cryptid sightings of 2014 – if they ’re real , might they be hiding in your backyard ? The legend of the Chupacabra – a bloodsucking monster that preys on livestock – continues to haunt the Southwest , most recently in March , when a Texas family claimed to have shot and killed a real Chupacabra . With its terrifying teeth and unholy grimace , the NN ’s corpse certainly fits the Chupcabra ’s description , but local authorities , their hearts dead to the magic of the West , VBP the NN was likely a local predator infected by Sarcoptic mange . NNP enthusiasts received a disappointing blow to their efforts on March 28 , when self - proclaimed “ best NNP tracker in the NN ” Rick Dyer admitted that his CD - NN publicity NN to convince the NN he ’d killed the beast was a lie . This was the second NN Dyer admitted to lying about killing the legendary monster , which raises the question of why anyone trusted him in the JJ place . Still , NNP claims are IN the Hydra : Knock CD down and another three grow in its place . 2014 has already seen NNP sightings in Detroit , Vermont and Maine . As you MD guess from its delightfully folksy moniker , the Yowie is the Australian analogue to NNP , a gigantic hominid rumored to hide in the Australian bush . Given NNP ’s remarkable biodiversity and relatively low population density , the Yowie might be slightly easier to VB in than its JJ relative , particularly among the numerous travelers who have recently reported seeing it in the NNP NNP Wales outback . NN theorist David Icke has popularized the NN that several NN leaders are actually reptilians in disguise , but less cynical cryptid fans have reported seeing lizard NNS wandering the wilderness in their natural NN , far from the corridors of NN . Typical is this account from February , in which a trio of bikers reported encountering a six - NN - tall reptile with clawed hands and snake eyes while traveling through the Arizona desert . “ When you read these stories RB or watch them on TV , you VBP , ‘ NN , these NNS are crazy , or on meds or something , ' ” CryptoZoologyNews.com quoted CD of the bikers as saying . “ This story has made me a believer . ” What ’s Portugese for “ spooky - scary ? ” The Brazilian Internet blew up in February after security footage of what appeared to be a terrifying wolf figure , complete with tales of frightened locals and security lockdowns , went viral . The rumors were finally stopped by the Internet equivalent of a silver bullet : A few skeptical sleuths , who noticed that the NN dated back to at least 2007 . Officials in the town reportedly terrorized by the werewolf VBD they had no knowledge of any such NN – of course , that ’s what they MD VB . If a NN of NN is JJ enough and deep enough , eventually NNS are VBG to start worrying there are monsters in it . The most recent rumblings come from NNP , where a NN of NNS has been studying Siberia ’s Lake Labynkyr , hoping to find evidence of a mysterious sea NN that fascinated the NN in 2013 . ( Initial reports that those divers VBD a JJ jawbone at the bottom of the lake have not been confirmed . ) Meanwhile in Scotland , longtime Loch Ness watchers are puzzled at the lack of sightings of their own aquatic monster – there have been no reports of “ Nessie ” in a NN and a half , for the JJ NN since 1925 . Maybe it migrated ?"

In that brief NN , his only visit to the NNP JJ continent , Steller managed to name several NNS of bird , including Steller ’s Jay , ubiquitous in the hills behind my Berkeley apartment . By the beginning of winter , the CD ships that made up the expedition had become separated , CD landing parties had vanished , and so JJ sailors on Bering ’s flagship had scurvy that they MD barely VB the sails . In November , the St. Peter ran aground on an uninhabited island . JJ of members of the expedition thought that it was attached to the Siberian mainland and that they MD eventually be able to walk to safety , but they were soon proven wrong . A short NN after reaching NN , the ship broke apart in a storm , and the captain died of scurvy . Steller , who knew how to combat the Vitamin C–deficiency by foraging for herbs , was CD of the few crew members still in good NN . Steller quickly realized that the landmass they were on was an island , and CD that likely had never been visited by JJ beings before . Everywhere he went , he was followed by foxes , which showed no fear but eagerly stole any implements or food they MD grab in their jaws . CD day , walking along the beach searching for firewood , he saw a huge , black NN moving slowly about in the shallows IN an overturned boat . Every few minutes a snout MD VB for a moment and draw breath with a noise IN a horse ’s snort . This was the sea cow , seen by the JJ eyes for the JJ NN in thousands of NNS . Steller was shocked to realize that this NN was a type of manatee , thousands of NNS from its nearest relatives in the tropics . He describes the sea cows as gentle giants , whose only real defense against being harpooned was their incredibly thick hides . He RB notes that they seem to have been unusually loyal to CD another , which proved to be more of a liability than an asset when the Russians began hunting them for food . They had , in his words , “ an uncommon love for CD another , which RB extended so far that , when CD of them was hooked , all the others were intent upon saving him . ” When the Russians harpooned CD of the sea cows , others MD come to its defense , making a circle IN their wounded comrade .

The discovery of Morgan ’s sphinx moth , which had a tongue just RB enough ( and no longer ) , proved Darwin RB — some CD decades after his death . It ’s CD of the great demonstrations of evolution by natural selection . But what naturalists RB VBP is to catch natural selection in the act , as it ’s doing the selecting . That ’s much harder , and a bit of luck is needed . Opportunity knocked at the door of biologist Colin Donihue at Harvard NNP in Cambridge , Massachusetts , a NN RB , just after he and his colleagues had returned from Pine Cay and NNP Cay , CD small islands in the Turks and Caicos archipelago to the NN of the Caribbean , where they had been studying the lives and times of its resident anole lizards ( Anolis scriptus ) . On 8 September last NN , Hurricane Irma struck the islands , battering them with sustained winds of up to 265 kilometres IN hour . Irma was the JJ category - 5 hurricane on record to strike the region , but more was to come : CD weeks later , Hurricane Maria swept across the islands with winds of up to 200 kilometres IN hour . Dozens of NNS in the region died . Reconstruction and rebuilding efforts continue . Read the paper : Hurricane - induced selection on the morphology of an island lizard Three weeks after the winds had died down , the NNS were back on Pine Cay and NNP Cay to assess the damage , and to VB how ( or RB if ) their lizards had survived . Their NN , published this week in Nature , is the JJ to VB an immediate before - and - after comparison to assess the impacts of hurricanes on evolutionary selection ( C. M. Donihue FW FW . Nature http://doi.org/csgp; 2018 ) . Serendipity can VB only so far . The NNS had n’t marked the lizards , so they MD n’t identify and track the fate of individuals . But they VBD clear trends of natural selection in action . In general , anoles VBN after the storms had bigger toepads , longer forelimbs and shorter hindlimbs than did lizards collected before the storm . What have these traits to do with hurricanes ? The lizards live in bushes and other low - growing vegetation . Toepads allow them purchase on the branches as they move , and it ’s a fair bet that limb proportions RB play a part in helping a lizard to keep in contact with a branch , resisting moves by predators , other lizards — or , as it turned out , hurricanes — to knock them off . The NNS took their idea further with a simple laboratory experiment , in which they allowed lizards to VB settled on a perch and then blew them off using a commercial leaf blower , recording the speed at which the lizards were dislodged . ( The lizards flew into comfy padding , and were not injured in the experiments . ) This experiment supported the NNS ’ hypothesis . In particular , it showed that when lizards are subjected to a stiff breeze , they hang on tightly with their forelimbs and let their hindlimbs hang loose . Longer hindlimbs , then , offer more purchase to the winds , explaining why lizards VBD after the storms tended to have shorter hindlimbs , but longer forelimbs . These bigger toepads , shorter hindlimbs and longer forelimbs did not evolve as a direct response to the hurricanes , but they show how such evolution occurs . Natural selection interfered with the NN in which these traits were spread across the population . Specifically , those lizards unable to hang on when the storms blew up — those with smaller toepads , longer hindlimbs and shorter forelimbs — were ( presumably ) blown away and perished . Those lizards better able to hang on tightly MD have survived to weather another day . In technical terms , the mean values of the crucial traits measured before the storms had shifted . These changes are phenotypic — merely observable characteristics . They VBP nothing about the genetic assimilation of such changes , which will presumably happen when the surviving lizards breed and JJ lizards are recruited to the population . Such changes are unlikely to be the last , given the expected increases in extreme weather that the future will bring ."

Of what possible threat MD honest , scientific discovery pose to national security or the common good ? Yet , this is exactly what happened when JJ diggers VBD skeletal remains of oversize NNS : giants . Disclose.tv reported earlier this NN on a story that was ridiculed and debunked as soon as it was made JJ some decades RB : that the Smithsonian Institution destroyed thousands of JJ JJ skeletons . The NNP NNP Daily Report was the JJ publication to claim that the US cover - up of JJ JJ remains began in the early 1900s . ( It is entirely possible that earlier NNS will be VBN , in the future . ) This leading scientific organization responded to allegations of their deceitful actions by filing a lawsuit to protect their sterling reputation . The Event Chronicle fills in the details : “ A US Supreme NNP ruling has forced the Smithsonian institution to release classified papers dating from the early 1900 ’s that proves the organization was involved in a major historical cover - up of evidence showing giants JJ remains in the tens of thousands had been uncovered all across NNP and were ordered to be destroyed by high - level administrators to protect the mainstream chronology of JJ evolution at the NN . “ The allegations stemming from the NNP Institution of Alternative Archeology ( AIAA ) that the Smithsonian Institution had destroyed thousands of JJ JJ remains during the early 1900 ’s was not taken lightly by the Smithsonian who responded by suing the organization for defamation and trying to damage the reputation of the 168 - NN JJ institution . “ … Smithsonian whistle blowers admitted to the existence of documents that allegedly proved the destruction of tens of thousands of JJ skeletons reaching between 6 NNS and 12 NNS in height , a reality mainstream archeology can not admit to for different reasons , claims AIAA spokesman , James Churward . ” Honestly , covering up the existence of giants on NN , in order to preserve a NN that explains how NNS came to inhabit NNP NNP , makes very little sense : who stands to gain , and who stands to lose ? MD it be that the US leadership decided that the citizenry MD freak out from the NN of giants who lived in the distant past ? The NNP ( Genesis 6:4 ) VBZ very matter - of - factly : “ There were giants in the NNP in those days ” – as if contemporary readers knew this to be true , undoubtedly from the passage of oral tradition . Great warriors IN Goliath ( bested by David and his sling ) were described , and the locations of giants ’ kingdoms were disclosed . JJ other civilizations IN the NN have “ myths ” about giants , as listed in this fascinating article by an unnamed author . JJ immigrants brought their cultural heritages with them . But a folk tale is a far cry from scientific rigor . So why the modern cover - up of actual physical evidence that supports those “ NNS ’s stories ? ” CD mundane explanation MD be that influential ( as in , wealthy ) , mainstream archaeologists wanted to maintain their scientific supremacy , and persuaded the federal NN to VB perpetuate the lie that giants never existed anywhere in the NN , much less in the continental US . After all , schools taught that the earliest JJ inhabitants trekked over a Bering Strait NN bridge – over the NN pole , nearly – into modern - day Alaska a mere 15,000 NNS RB . Perhaps the scientific community “ needed to be JJ ? ” Fortunately for Us the NNPS , with the age of the internet and instant , JJ communication the NN is becoming harder and harder to hide . In this NN , the oldest JJ fossils – not gigantic , by the NN – have been VBN in northern Africa ( Jebel Irhoud , Morocco ) . These remains date to RB 315,000 NNS JJ , as The Atlantic Daily , Nature , and other scientific publications have reported ! Archaeological discoveries keep pushing the date of JJ ( homo sapiens sapiens , that is ) origin further and further back in NN . These dates happen to jive with ancient source texts that discuss JJ origin , notably the Sumerian clay tablets translated by Zecharia Sitchin . This Azerbaijani - born JJ researcher and author upset the anthropological NN with his revelation that NNS had been bred by an off - NN race called the Annunaki – “ alien overlords ” ( in this NN , the term actually does fit ) – to serve them , especially to mine gold in the hot African NN . Just as the NNP later described , the Annunaki – or “ fallen angels ” – bred with JJ NNS and birthed …a race of giants called the Nephilim . The giants had JJ appetites , and devoured all the crops and livestock before turning to NNS as their next food source . At this point , the Annunaki admitted that the Nephilim had gotten out of hand , and flooded the NN as a JJ Mulligan ( “ do - over ” ) – kind of IN shaking an Etch - a - Sketch upside down in order to “ clean the slate . ” Now , this is where the NN about giants gets interesting . Sitchin ’s work continues to be refuted by “ experts , ” RB as more archaeological evidence of beings with elongated skulls , giants and ancient African gold mines inhabited by early NNS continues to pile up . Is the NNP NNP Order actually threatened by a citizenry that is fully aware of our alien - hybridized JJ origin ? If NNS , collectively , understood that we were created to serve ETs ( termed “ gods ” in ancient texts ) , how MD that VB our society and others IN the NN ? Ignoring the Illuminati agenda , alternative NN sources continue to report similar “ gigantic ” findings from IN the NN . To cite just a couple : “ Nephilim Bones and NNP JJ Skeletons in Greece ” and “ Skeletons of 5,000 - NN - JJ Chinese ‘ giants ’ discovered by archaeologists . ” Regardless of the “ why ” behind yet another NN discovery / lie / cover - up , it is clear that , in those days , yeah – there RB were giants ."

For JJ NNS , this is the dreariest NN of the NN . But for a small niche of NN - happy athletes , winter is a NN to play , as ferocious storms send rippling rings of NN outward through the ocean . By the NN they reach distant shores , these swells have matured into clean , polished waves that barrel in with a cold and ceaseless JJ rhythm ; they touch bottom , slow , build and , finally , collapse in spectacular curls and thundering white NN . These are the things of dreams for surfers , JJ of whom travel the NN , pursuing JJ breakers . And surfers are n’t the only ones with their eyes on the NN — for surfing has become a popular spectator sport . At JJ famed breaks , bluffs on the shore provide fans with thrilling views of the action . The waves alone are awesome — so powerful they MD seem to shake the NN . But when a tiny JJ figure on a board as flimsy as a matchstick appears on the face of that incoming NN , zigzagging forward as the wave curls overhead and threatens to crush him , spines tingle , hands come together in prayer , and jaws drop . Whether you VBP the NN or not , JJ - wave surfing is CD of the most thrilling shows on the NN . The birth of JJ - wave surfing was an incremental process that began in the 1930s and ’ 40s in Hawaii , especially along the NN - facing shores of the islands . Here , 15 - NN waves were once considered giants , and anything much bigger just eye candy . But wave at a NN , surfers stoked up their courage and ambition . They surfed on bigger days , VBD lighter and lighter boards that allowed swifter paddling and hunted for breaks that consistently produced monsters . CD by CD , JJ - wave spots were cataloged , named and ranked , and wave at a NN , records were set . In November 1957 , JJ - wave pioneer Greg Noll rode an estimated 25 - footer in Waimea Bay , Oahu . In 1969 , Noll surfed what was probably a 30 - plus - footer , but no verified photos exist of the wave , and thus no means of determining its height . Fast - forwarding a few decades , Mike Parsons caught a 66 - NN breaker in 2001 at Cortes Bank , 115 NNS off San Diego , where a seamount rises to within three NNS of the NN . In 2008 , Parsons was back at the same place and caught a 77 - footer . But Garrett McNamara outdid Parsons and set the current record in November 2011 , when he rode a 78 - NN wave off the coast of Portugal , at the town of Nazare . But these later records MD not have been possible without the assistance of jet skis , which have become a common and controversial element in the pursuit of JJ waves . The vehicles RB began appearing in the surf during JJ - wave events in the early 1990s , and for all their noise and stench , their appeal was undeniable : Jet skis made it possible to access waves 40 NNS and bigger , and whose scale had previously been too grand for most unassisted surfers to reach by paddling . Though tow - in surfing has given a boost to the record books , it has RB heightened the danger of surfing , and JJ surfers have died in JJ waves they might never have attempted without jet - ski assistance . Not surprisingly , JJ surfers have rejected tow - in surfing as an affront to the purity of their relationship with waves — and they still manage to catch monsters . In March 2011 , Shane Dorian rode a 57 - NN breaker at the famed Jaws break in Maui , unassisted by a belching CD - stroke engine . But JJ JJ - wave riders fully endorse tow - in surfing as a natural evolution of the sport . Surfing supertstar Laird Hamilton has RB blown off purists who continue to paddle after JJ waves without jet skis as “ moving backward . ” Anyway , in a sport that relies heavily on satellite imagery , Internet swell forecasts and red - eye flights to Honolulu , are we RB complaining about a little high - tech assistance ? For those wishing merely to watch JJ waves and the competitors that gather to ride them , all that is needed is a picnic blanket and binoculars — and perhaps some NN from this swell forecast NN . Following are some superb sites to watch surfers catch the biggest breakers in the NN this winter . Waimea Bay , NNP Shore of Oahu . JJ - wave surfing was born here , largely fueled by the fearless vision of Greg Noll in the 1950s . The definition of “ JJ ” for extreme surfers has grown since the early days , yet Waimea still holds its own . Fifty - NN waves can occur here — events that chase all but the best wave riders from the NN . When conditions allow , elite surfers participate in the recurring Quicksilver Eddie Aikau Invitational . Spectators teem on the shore during JJ - swell periods , and while surfers MD fight for their ride , you MD have to fight for your view . VB there early . Jaws , NNP Shore of Maui . RB VBN as Peahi , Jaws produces some of the most feared and attractive waves on NN . The break — where 50 - footers and bigger appear almost every NN — is almost strictly a tow - in NN , but rebel paddle - by - hand surfers do business here , too . Twenty - CD pros have been invited to convene at Jaws this winter for a paddle - in competition sometime between December 7 and March 15 . Spectators are afforded a great view of the action on a high nearby bluff . But VB early , as hundreds will be in line for the best viewing points . RB , bring binoculars , as the breakers crash almost a mile offshore . Mavericks , Half NNP Bay , California . Mavericks gained its reputation in the 1980s and ’90s , during the revival of JJ - wave surfing , which lost some popularity in the 1970s . Named for a German Shepherd named Maverick who took a surgy swim here in 1961 , the NN ( which gained an “ s ” but never an official apostrophe ) generates some of the biggest surfable waves in the NN . Today , surfing competitions , IN the Mavericks NNP Wave Contest and the Mavericks Invitational , are held each NN . The waves of Mavericks crash on a vicious reef , making them predictable ( sandy bottoms will shift and VB the wave form ) but nonetheless hazardous . CD of the best surfers of his NN , Mark Foo died here in 1994 when his ankle leash is believed to have snagged on the bottom . Later , the waves claimed the NN of Hawaiian surfing star Sion Milosky . A high bluff above the beach offers a view of the action . As at Jaws , bring binoculars . Ghost Trees , Monterey Peninsula , California . This break hits peak form under the same swell conditions that VBP things roaring at Mavericks , just a three - hour drive RB . Ghost Trees is a relatively JJ attraction for JJ - wave riders . Veteran surfer Don Curry VBZ he RB saw it surfed in 1974 . Decades MD pass before it became famous , and before it killed pro surfer ( and a pioneer of nearby Mavericks ) Peter Davi in 2007 . For surfing spectators , there are few places quite IN Ghost Trees . The waves , which can hit 50 NNS and more , break just a NN field ’s length from shore . Mullaghmore Head , Ireland . Far from the classic Pacific shores of JJ - wave legend and history , Mullaghmore Head comes alive during winter storms in the NNP Atlantic . The location produces waves JJ enough that surfing here has become primarily a jet ski-assisted NN . In fact , the event period for the Billabong Tow - In Session at Mullaghmore began on November 1 and will run through February 2013 . Just how JJ is Mullaghmore Head ? On March 8 , 2012 , the waves here reached 50 NNS , as determined by satellite measurements . A grassy headland provides an elevated platform from which to VB the show . Bundle up if you VBP , and expect cold , blustery conditions . Teahupoo , Tahiti . This coveted break blooms with JJ swells from the Southern Ocean — RB during the southern winter . Teahupoo is famed for its classic tube breakers . Shipsterns Bluff , Tasmania . Watch for this point ’s giants to break from June through September . Punta de Lobos , Chile . Channeling the NN of the Southern Ocean into huge but glassy curlers , Punta de Lobos breaks at its best in March and April . Todos Santos Island , Baja California , Mexico . Todos Santos Island features several well - VBN breaks , but “ Killers ” is the biggest and baddest . The surf RB peaks in the northern winter . There is another sort of wave that thrills tourists and spectators : the tidal bore . These NN - induced phenomena occur with regularity at particular locations IN the NN . The most spectacular to VB include the tidal bores of Hangzhou Bay , China , and Araguari , Brazil — each of which has become a popular surfing event ."

Joe is a mexicano who knew some of the same Spanish folktales that Juan B. Rael had collected JJ NNS earlier in the area IN Antonito , Colorado . I VBD Joe in his NN of “ collectables ” on Main Street . His NN was a little community center where NNS from town dropped in to talk about the NN of the day . Joe is a lot IN his father , Anastacio , whose boot ‐making shop had RB become a little community center . Joe remembers sheepherders complaining to his father that the police had stolen their NN . The sheepherders came to town to collect their pay and VB on a bender . They deposited most of their NN with the cops who pocketed it for themselves and denied having received it . Anastacio was n't afraid of confronting the cops . Joe 's dad was a valorista , or brave NN of his word who defended the weak against the strong . Joe told me the folktales he had learned from his NNS and then nudged me in a different direction . He took me to his backyard shed , pulled out a dusty box of manuscripts he had written in JJ hand and asked me to read them . Joe liked to read western novels by Louis L'amour and emulated that author 's style . CD of the manuscripts was a story about NNP . I knew about his interest in the NN because he had shown us a NN he and his son had taken of JJ footprints with an unusually JJ gait in the NN RB of town . Joe did not VB the NN that made them , and so he sought out others who had . Several had caught fleeting glimpses of something crossing Highway 285 in the cut just across the NNP Mexico border . A woodcutter VBD he VBD the cave where NNP lives . A rancher VBD he came face to face with the NN in the Hansen Creek area in the San Juan Wilderness west of town . That same rancher added that JJ NNP live in the llano between CD dormant volcanoes , Mt. San Antonio RB of town and Ute Mountain to the east . At RB I did n't understand why a NN IN Joe , who spent his NN fighting for his raza MD care so much about proving the existence of NNP . Did n't the NN come from mass NN , and were n't most enthusiasts white working class NNS on the wrong side of the Civil Rights struggle ? Joe has stood up for the underdog his entire NN . He worked as a business agent for the union presenting grievances to the Miner brothers who managed the Perlite plant RB of town . Joe VBD : “ They had my raza down in the lower paying jobs sweeping and doing the cleaning and all the hard labor . Bud Miner hated to VB me coming . He told me : ‘ I 'm tired of you Mexicans coming over here and trying to tell us what to do . ’ ” There is a lot of chicanery connected with this NNP JJ wildman , and so I shied away from the subject at RB . Every NN we returned to Antonito , Joe told me he had VBN another NN who had seen footprints or caught a fleeting glimpse of the NN . An Anglo showed some photographs of footprints he had taken with his NN phone camera . We held CD NNP parties in our Antonito home with NNS whose testimonies Joe considered believable . We followed them up with interviews in their homes . Joe will talk to anyone who has seen NNP . It does n't matter to him if they are Anglos or mexicanos . He knows from watching television that NNP NNS are mainly Anglos . Joe cobbled together what he learned from the witnesses to write his story , which he VBZ is “ pure fiction . ” The central protagonist , Marc Gomez , is Joe 's idea of a mexicano everyman who has lost touch with his ancestors . Marc is 39 , just divorced from his wife , retired after 20 NNS in the army , and is living in Los Angeles . He loves to read western paperback novels about NNP Mexico and is ready for a NN . He packs up his NNP Stream trailer , hitches it to his Bronco , and heads toward the NNP of Enchantment . Marc , IN Joe himself , sets out on a quest to find NNP after he dreamt of JJ faceless creatures running after him on a forsaken prairie . He heads up Highway 285 and overhears , on his CB radio , a conversation between truckers CD of whom VBZ : “ Some NN came out of the bar pit . I 'm sure I hit it with my back wheels . Looked IN a bear or something JJ . ” Marc follows leads to an JJ mexicano sheepherder who lives in Velarde , NNP Mexico , who ran into the NN on the llano near Ute Mountain . The sheepherder has a daughter , Cristina , and she becomes Marc 's lover and companion , and together they enter NNP 's NN in the volcanic caverns under the llano . Marc and Cristina discover the NN 's NN is IN that of NNS above the llano . The strong prey on the weak in both places . Marc and Cristina show they are both valoristas by defending the weaker NNP from the stronger ones who attempt to enslave them . Each witness we interviewed had a particular take on the NN . They VBD he is peaceful , adapted , intelligent looking , strong , massive but graceful , and proud . Some VBP he is a loner , and others VBP he lives in families . Those with greater knowledge of the environment speak with more authority . The mexicanos I VBP tell and write stories about NNP to claim their rightful place on a llano they share with others ."

This_DT article_NN was_VBD posted_VBN :_: Tuesday_NNP ,_, March_NNP 25_CD ,_, 2014_CD at_IN 6:16_CD am_NN","What MD Happen If A JJ Tsunami Hit Florida ? Can you imagine the devastation that MD be caused if a massive wall of NN several hundred NNS high slammed into Florida at more than 100 NNS an hour ? To JJ NNS such a scenario is impossible , but that is what NNS living along the Indian Ocean thought before the 2004 tsunami and that is what NNS living in Japan thought before the 2011 tsunami . Throughout history , JJ tsunamis have been relatively rare events , but they do happen . NNS tell us that a mega - tsunami can race across the open ocean at up to 500 NNS an hour , and when they reach shore they can produce waves that are hundreds of NNS high . And RB though authorities claim that the threat to Florida is “ remote ” , it might surprise you to learn that there are “ Tsunami Hazard Zone ” signs on Florida beaches . If a highly unusual event ( such as a JJ meteor hitting the Atlantic Ocean ) caused a JJ tsunami that hit Florida , the devastation MD be absolutely unimaginable . Most NNS do n’t realize this , but almost the entire bottom half of Florida is just barely above sea level . If a JJ tsunami did hit Florida , there MD be nothing to stop it from sweeping across the entire NN … NNP Florida has CD JJ problems . The JJ is its remarkably JJ topography . Half the area that surrounds Miami is less than five NNS above sea level . Its highest natural elevation , a limestone ridge that runs from Palm Beach to just RB of the city , averages a scant 12 NNS . With just three NNS of sea - level rise , more than a third of southern Florida will vanish ; at six NNS , more than half will be gone ; if the seas rise 12 NNS , NNP Florida will be little more than an isolated archipelago surrounded by abandoned buildings and crumbling overpasses . And the waters wo n’t just come in from the east – because the region is so JJ , rising seas will come in nearly as fast from the west too , through the Everglades . RB worse , NNP Florida sits above a vast and porous limestone plateau . “ Imagine Swiss cheese , and you ’ll have a pretty good idea what the rock under southern Florida looks IN , ” VBZ Glenn Landers , a senior engineer at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . This means NN moves RB easily – it seeps into yards at high tide , bubbles up on golf courses , flows through underground caverns , corrodes building foundations from below . “ Conventional sea walls and barriers are not effective here , ” VBZ Robert Daoust , an ecologist at ARCADIS , a Dutch firm that specializes in engineering solutions to rising seas . Of course the authorities do all that they can to play down this potential threat . They VBP that it is “ highly unlikely ” that a tsunami will ever hit Florida . The following comes from the Florida Department of NNP Protection … Although it is highly unlikely that a tsunami will impact Florida , it is not impossible . Floridians MD RB travel to locations where tsunamis are more likely . It is vital to VB ( and instruct NNS ) that if the ocean suddenly recedes from the shore do not stand and stare . It is necessary immediately to run uphill or away from the shore and VB to the highest location possible which MD mean up the stairs of a substantial building . Everyone should be aware that no matter where in the NN they are , if the sea is observed to recede from the shore , they should immediately run for high ground . That last part is quite funny . There is no “ high ground ” until you VBP to NNP Florida . If a mega - tsunami strikes , there is VBG to be no place to hide . And JJ tsunamis do happen in the Atlantic Ocean from NN to NN . For example , National Geographic VBZ that there have been 37 verified tsunamis in the Caribbean since 1498 … In recent NNS , there have been some NNS that have been concerned about what MD happen if there was a major earthquake in the Caribbean region or a volcanic eruption in the Canary Islands . The following comes from CBS NNP … Meteorologist Bart Hagemeyer from the National Weather Service VBZ an earthquake in the Caribbean region is likely to project wave NN more to the NN and less toward Florida . But the direction can vary and much of the outcome depends on the amount of NN released by the earthquake . The highly unlikely tsunami that Florida might keep in mind MD come from across the Atlantic , created by the collapse of a volcano in the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa , VB experts . For NNS , some have thought that the unstable volcanic structures in the Canary Islands MD VB massive tsunamis to slam into the East Coast of the U.S. if they crumbled into the sea . That MD have the potential of a not just a garden - variety of tsunami , but a “ mega - tsunami , ” according to Hagemeyer . So what MD such a “ mega - tsunami ” look IN ? Well , according to Dr. Simon Day and Dr. Steven Ward , it MD produce a wall of NN approximately 164 NNS high … Dr Day , working in conjunction with Dr Steven Ward of the NNP of California , has now produced an updated NN that predicts more accurately the size of the tsunami and the areas it will impact . The NN predicts that after the landslide the tsunami MD travel a distance of almost 155 NNS in just 10 minutes and MD reach the Caribbean and Florida in eight or nine hours . The forecast goes on to predict that a wall of NN 164ft high MD smash into the coasts of the Caribbean and Florida , while Brazil ’s northern coast MD be hit by a wave more than 130 ft high . Personally , however , I am convinced that the much greater potential threat comes from above . According to the NNP of California at Santa Cruz NN , if a massive asteroid were to crash into the Atlantic Ocean it MD produce a JJ tsunami with a wall of NN as high as 400 NNS that MD slam into the east coast of the NNP NNPS … In NN you were wondering , yes , that MD be absolutely catastrophic . Major U.S. cities stretching from the tip of Florida all the NN up to Maine MD essentially be destroyed . The following is an excerpt from an article posted on Modern Survival Blog … 300 NN tsunami MD be the probable devastation of the following major East Coast cities … Portland , ME (~ 50 ′ ) Boston , MA (~ 30 ′ ) NNP Haven , CT (~ 50 ′ ) Bridgeport , CT ( ~ 40 ′ ) NNP York City , NY ( ~ 20 ′ ) Jersey City , NJ ( ~ 30 ′ ) Newark , NJ (~ 50 ′ ) Atlantic City , NJ (~ 10 ′ ) Wilmington , DE (~ 80 ′ ) Philadelphia , PA ( ~ 40 ′ ) Virginia Beach , VA (~ 10 ′ ) Wilmington , NC (~ 20 ′ ) Myrtle Beach , SC (~ 20 ′ ) Charleston , SC (~ 10 ′ ) Savannah , GA (~ 10 ′ ) Daytona Beach , FL ( less than 10 ′ ) West Palm Beach , FL ( less than 10 ′ ) Fort Lauderdale , FL ( less than 10 ′ ) Miami , FL ( less than 10 ′ ) There are countless cities in between these coastal cities . The Eastern Seaboard of the NNP NNPS includes some of the largest metropolitan areas in the NN . Over CD third of the NN ( more than 100 CD NNS ) live along the East Coast . Evacuation MD be virtually impossible for most ( except for the astute who act quickly ) due to only hours notice , probable doubt , and the subsequent immediate gridlock that MD follow . Most NNS MD tell you that the possibility of such a thing is extremely small . But MD it be possible that they are wrong ? At this point , more than 10,000 major near NN objects have been discovered , and about 10 percent of them are CD kilometer or larger in size . And there are JJ more out there that are still undiscovered . In fact , NNS are discovering JJ ones all the NN . Sometimes , astronomers only spot them after they have passed our NN . What is RB more alarming is that the number of “ fireball events ” that are being recorded appears to be greatly increasing . Just check out this chart from the NNP Meteor Society … So why is this happening ? Why are so JJ JJ rocks suddenly flying by so close to our NN ? And what is VBG to happen when a RB JJ rock slams into us CD day ? Please feel free to share what you VBP by posting a comment below … This article was posted : Tuesday , March 25 , 2014 at 6:16 am"

It makes up most of our noodles and breads that are the source of most carbohydrates in our diet . Modern wheat RB is n’t wheat at all and far from the NN food the wheat industry wants you to VB it is . High - yielding and now genetically modified varieties of wheat are making this CD cereal grain you ’ll probably VB to axe from your food list . So how–and when –did this ancient grain become such a serious NN threat ? Author and preventive cardiologist William Davis , MD , VBZ it ’s when JJ agriculture stepped in decades RB to develop a higher - yielding crop . Today ’s “ wheat , ” he VBZ , is n’t RB wheat , thanks to some of the most intense crossbreeding efforts ever seen . “ The wheat NNS sold to you today are nothing IN the wheat NNS of our grandmother ’s age , very different from the wheat of the early 20th NN , and completely transformed from the wheat of the NNP and earlier , ” he VBZ . Plant breeders changed wheat in dramatic ways . Once more than four NNS tall , modern wheat –the type grown in 99 percent of wheat fields IN the world–is now a stocky CD - NN - tall plant with an unusually JJ seed head . Dr. Davis VBZ accomplishing this involved crossing wheat with non-wheat grasses to introduce altogether JJ genes , using techniques IN irradiation of wheat seeds and embryos with chemicals , gamma rays , and high - dose X - rays to induce mutations . Australian NNS have now revealed serious issues over a JJ kind of genetically engineered wheat that MD induce major NN threats for NNS that consume it . NNP of Canterbury Professor Jack Heinemann announced the outcomes of his genetic NN into the wheat , a kind engineered by NNP ’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ( CSIRO ) . Additional claims came from NNS in NNP to have developed a form of salt - tolerant wheat that MD allow farmers to grow crops in NN with high salinity . Japan ’s flour NNS are RB rejecting GM wheat , echoing consumer opposition . In a statement released today , the Flour Miller ’s Association of Japan wrote to the No! GMO NN indicating its opposition . “ Under the present circumstances , with all the doubts about safety and the environment that the consumers in Japan have , including the effect on the JJ NN from GM foods , GM wheat is included among the items that are not acceptable for the Japanese NN , ” Kadota Masaaki , senior managing director of the Flour Miller ’s Association wrote to the No! GMO NN . The Nutrional Value of Wheat is Practically Non-Existent In Its Current Form So - called NN experts in nutrition who continue to promote the NN benefits of wheat are extremely uninformed about the nature of modern wheat and its evolution from growth to consumption . It is shocking how JJ professionals in JJ NN still recommend wheat NNS without an assessment of their individual requirements , especially considering the amount of evidence regarding its lack of nutrition and NN risks for proportionally JJ segments of the population . The majority of wheat is processed into 60 % extraction , bleached white flour . 60 % extraction –the standard for most wheat NNS means that 40 % of the original wheat grain is removed . So not only do we have an unhealthier , modified , and hybridized strain of wheat , we RB remove and further degrade its nutritional value by processing it . Unfortunately , the 40 % that gets removed includes the bran and the germ of the wheat grain–its most nutrient - rich parts . In the process of making 60 % extraction flour , over half of the vitamin B1 , B2 , B3 , E , folic acid , calcium , phosphorus , zinc , copper , iron , and fiber are lost . Any processed foods with wheat are akin to poison for the NN since they VBP more NN risks than benefits . The NN does not recognize processed wheat as food . Nutrient absorption from processed wheat NNS is thus consequential with almost no nutritional value . Some experts claim if you select 100 % whole wheat NNS , the bran and the germ of the wheat will remain in your meals , and the NN benefits will be impressive . This is again a falsity promoted by the wheat industry since RB 100 % whole wheat NNS are VBN on modern wheat strains created by irradiation of wheat seeds and embryos with chemicals , gamma rays , and high - dose X - rays to induce mutations . Whether you consume 10 % or 100 % of wheat is irrelevant since you ’re still consuming a NN damaging grain that will not benefit , advance or RB maintain your NN in any NN . Dr. Marcia Alvarez who specializes in nutritional programs for obese patients VBZ that when it comes to nutrition , wheat MD be considered as an evil grain . “ Modern wheat grains MD certainly be considered as the root of all evil in the NN of nutrition since they VBP so JJ documented NN problems across so JJ populations in the NN . ” Dr. Alvarez asserted that wheat is now responsible for more intolerances than almost any other food in the NN . “ In my practice of over CD decades , we have documented that for every ten NNS with digestive problems , obesity , irritable bowel syndrome , diabetes , arthritis and RB heart NN , eight out of ten have a problem with wheat . Once we remove wheat from their diets , most of their NNS disappear within three to six months , ” she added . Dr. Alvarez estimates that between the coming influx of genetically modified ( GM ) strains of wheat and the current tendency of wheat elimination in societies , that a trend is emerging in the next 20 NNS that will likely VB 80 % of NNS cease their consumption of wheat from any form . A powerful little chemical in wheat VBN as ‘ wheat germ agglutinin’ ( WGA ) which is largely responsible for JJ of wheat ’s pervasive , and difficult to diagnose , ill effects . NNS are now discovering that WGA in modern wheat is very different from ancient strains . Not only does WGA throw a monkey wrench into our assumptions about the primary causes of wheat intolerance , but due to the fact that WGA is VBN in highest concentrations in “ whole wheat , ” including its supposedly superior sprouted form , it RB pulls the rug out from under CD of the NN food industry ’s favorite poster NNS . Evidence is mounting that a significant percentage of the population is sensitive to gluten . When we eat bread that contains gluten ( wheat , spelt , rye and barley ) , the immune NN in our digestive tract “ attacks ” the gluten proteins . Gluten sensitivity is RB associated with some NNS of schizophrenia and cerebellar ataxia – both serious disorders of the brain . Gluten is probably harmful for most NNS , not just those with diagnosed celiac NN or gluten sensitivity . The only NN to RB VB if you ’re gluten sensitive is to remove gluten from your diet for 30 days and then reintroduce it and VB whether it affects you . Each grain of wheat contains about CD microgram of Wheat Germ Agglutinin ( WGA ) . RB in small quantities , WGA can have profoundly adverse effects . It MD be pro-inflammatory , immunotoxic , cardiotoxic … and neurotoxic . Below the radar of conventional serological testing for antibodies against the various gluten proteins and genetic testing for NN susceptibility , the WGA “ lectin problem ” remains almost entirely obscured . Lectins , though VBN in all grains , seeds , legumes , dairy and our beloved nightshades : the tomato and potato , are rarely discussed in connection with NN or illness , RB when their presence in our diet MD greatly reduce both the quality and length of our lives . Yet NN experts dismiss the links between NN and wheat despite all the evidence . Dr William Davis has documented several hundred JJ studies on the adverse effects of wheat . These are studies that document the neurologic impairments unique to wheat , including cerebellar ataxia and dementia ; heart NN ; visceral fat accumulation and all its attendant NN consequences ; the process of glycation via amylopectin A of wheat that leads to cataracts , diabetes , and arthritis ; among others . There are , in fact , a wealth of studies documenting the adverse , often crippling , effects of wheat consumption in NNS . The other claim is that wheat elimination ‘ means missing out on a wealth of essential nutrients . Another falsity . Dr. Davis VBZ that if you replace wheat with healthy foods IN vegetables , nuts , healthy oils , meats , eggs , cheese , avocados , and olives , then there is no nutrient deficiency that develops with elimination of wheat . Dr Davis RB VBZ that NNS with celiac NN MD require JJ - term supplementation due to extensive gastrointenstinal damage caused by wheat . NNS with celiac NN do indeed experience deficiencies of multiple vitamins and minerals after they eliminate all wheat and gluten from the diet . But this is not due to a diet lacking valuable nutrients , but from the incomplete healing of the gastrointestinal tract ( such as the lining of the duodenum and proximal jejunum ) . In these NNS , the destructive effects of wheat are so overpowering that , unfortunately , some NNS never heal completely . These NNS do indeed require vitamin and mineral supplementation , as well as probiotics and pancreatic enzyme supplementation . Due to the unique properties of amylopectin A , CD slices of whole wheat bread increase NN sugar higher than JJ candy bars . High NN glucose leads to the process of glycation that , in turn , causes arthritis ( cartilage glycation ) , cataracts ( lens NN glycation ) , diabetes ( glycotoxicity of pancreatic beta NNS ) , hepatic de novo lipogenesis that increases triglycerides and , thereby , increases expression of atherogenic ( heart NN - causing ) small LDL particles , leading to heart attacks . Repetitive high NN sugars that develop from a grain - rich diet are , in my view , very destructive and lead to weight gain ( specifically visceral fat ) , insulin resistance , leptin resistance ( leading to obesity ) , and JJ of the NN struggles that JJ now experience . Andrew L. Rubman , ND , is JJ director , Southbury NNP for Traditional Medicines , Southbury , Connecticut , VBD wheat consumption ( specifically gluten VBN in wheat , rye and barley ) MD play a role in turning the genetic diabetes switch to “ on ” for those who carry the NN gene . Dr. Rubman VBZ that gluten avoidance might prove useful for NNS who already havediabetes because it MD reduce the impact of the NN . He suggests to try a gluten - free diet for four to six months to VB if symptom severity and NN sugar NN improve . If the answer is yes , Dr. Rubman advises staying gluten - free for NN . Wheat gliadin has been associated with cerebellar ataxia , peripheral neuropathy , gluten encephalopathy ( dementia ) , behavioral outbursts in NNS with ADHD and NN , and paranoid delusions and auditory hallucinations in NNS with schizophrenia , severe and incapacitating effects for NNS suffering from these conditions . According to statistics from the NNP of Chicago Celiac NNP Center , an average of CD out of every 133 otherwise healthy NNS in the NNP NNPS suffers from CD . However , an estimated 20 - 30 percent of the NN ’s population MD carry the genetic susceptibility to celiac disease–and the NN to avoid turning these genes ‘ on ’ is by avoiding gluten . When you consider that undiagnosed CD is associated with a nearly four - fold increased NN of premature death , the seriousness of this food sensitivity becomes quite evident . The primary NN mechanism at play is chronic inflammation , and chronic inflammatory and degenerative conditions are endemic to grain - consuming populations . Changes in genetic code and , thereby , antigenic profile , of the high - yield semi- dwarf wheat cultivars now on the NN account for the marked increase in celiac potential nationwide . “ Hybridization ” techniques , including chemical mutagenesis to induce selective mutations , leads to NN of unique strains that are not subject to NN or JJ safety testing –they are just brought to NN and sold . Author and preventive cardiologist William Davis , MD , wheat ’s JJ biochemical code causes hormone disruption that is linked to diabetes and obesity . “ It is not my contention that it is in everyone ’s best interest to cut back on wheat ; it is my belief that complete elimination is in everyone ’s best NN interests , ” VBZ Dr. Davis , “ In my view , that ’s how bad this thing called ‘ wheat ’ has become . ” Chemical mutagenesis using the toxic mutagen , sodium azide , of course , is the method VBN to generate BASF ’s Clearfield herbicide - resistant wheat strain . These methods are being VBN on a wide scale to generate unique genetic strains that are , without question from the FDA or USDA , assumed to be safe for JJ consumption . * Note that JJ of the wheat - free options still contain gluten . 1. Cereal Grains : Barley , millet , oats , rice , rye , sorghum , tef and wild rice are all in the same cereal grain family as is wheat . All flours ground from cereal grains MD be VBN as a wheat substitute . Commonly available are barley , buckwheat , rice and rye flour . The less utilized flours MD be purchased RB or from natural food NNS . Note : NNS with a gluten allergy must RB avoid barley , oats and rye . 2. Non-Cereal Grains : Amaranth , quinoa and buckwheat are three grain - IN seeds unrelated to cereal grains . ( Despite its name , buckwheat is not a wheat - relative . ) It is rare for anyone to develop a sensitivity to these non-cereal grains . Amaranth , quinoa and buckwheat are gluten - free and therefore not suitable for making leavened bread ; however , they VBP excellent quick breads and cookies . 3. Nut Meal : Ground nuts such as almonds , hazelnuts or walnuts VBP the richest flour substitute for cookies and cakes . Because their fragile fatty acid content gives them a brief shelf NN , it ’s preferable to grind your own nuts in a food processor just prior to NN . Nut meal requires a binding agent such as eggs . Because chestnuts are lower in fat than other nuts , chestnut flour has a longer shelf NN . It is available RB . 4. Bean Flour : Dried beans , such as navy , pinto and chickpeas MD be milled and VBN , in combination with other flours , as a wheat alternative . Bean flour is , however , not always recommended . It tastes IN beans and makes baked goods dense and hard to digest . 5. Other Flour Substitutes : Potato starch , arrowroot powder , and tapioca are thickening agents that substitute for wheat in sauces and gravy . In baked goods these starchy ingredients serve as a binding agent . Due to the irresponsible high frequency hybridization , processing and inevitable genetic modification of modern wheat , there is only CD solution for the NN and wellness of future generations . Stop eating wheat and educate as JJ NNS as you can on the coming strains of this grain which will be much more deadly than they already are today .

NN reports last week suggesting that NNP DNA evidence had been analyzed and confirmed through the peer - reviewed DeNovo Scientific Journal raised questions over the legitimacy of the publication . Questions were RB raised — and have still not been fully answered — about Texas veterinarian Melba Ketchum ’s involvement with the journal , threatening the credibility of her five - NN NN of various alleged NNP DNA samples . Ketchum ’s NNP Genome Project NN has released the following short NN , reportedly showing a sleeping NNP in Kentucky in 2005 : The NN above certainly raises JJ questions about the circumstances surrounding an alleged sleeping NNP . How did the videographer VB so close to the NN without disturbing it ? What was the outcome of this event ? Did the NNP just VB up and run away , or turn to attack the cameraman ? Why has it taken eight NNS for this to be shown ? Why ca n’t the NN VB the rest of the footage ? Ketchum has felt that the scientific community tried to prevent her work from seeing the light of day . “ We encountered the worst scientific bias in the peer review process in recent history , ” Ketchum wrote on her NNP Genome Project NN . “ Several journals MD n’t RB read our manuscript when we sent them a pre-submission inquiry . We were RB mocked by CD reviewer in his peer review . We did finally pass peer review with a relatively JJ journal , ” she wrote . Over the past week , some have alleged that Ketchum somehow “ purchased ” a little - VBN journal in order to re-register it under a JJ name — DeNovo Scientific Journal — and then publish her own results of over 111 samples of reported NN hair , NN , toenail , saliva and NN . “ I ’m certainly not ruling out the possibility that there was a NN of sorts , or a concerted effort to not give this a fair shake , given the controversial matter , ” VBD Idaho NNP NNP anthropologist Jeff Meldrum , a leading academic and recognized scientific authority on NNP . “ To VB an end - run IN the process by erecting a facade in the form of a so - called JJ journal and allege that it is edited and reviewed , without providing any of that information on the JJ web page , it appears that she has undertaken an effort to self - publish , just to VB it out there , ” Meldrum told The Huffington Post . “ And , to boot , she ’s charging $ 30 a pop for a copy of the paper . ” Meldrum VBD he does n’t VB any credible scientific journal MD shy away from the topic simply because of its controversial nature . “ I MD n’t rule it out entirely . There are certainly politics involved in the selection of papers . If it ’s solid work , this is the discovery of the NN , if not the millennium , ” Meldrum VBD . “ Any journal , if they were confident in the results and in the expertise of their reviewers , and it came down positive — I MD VB they MD clamor for the opportunity to have that on the front cover of their journal . ” While this drama was played out in the NN , other related NNP DNA stories quietly emerged . In Colorado , a group of NNS that contributed possible NN samples to Ketchum ’s NN claim to have evidence that MD prove NNP ’s existence . Dave Paulides , of NNP NNP NNP Search , told CBS 4 Denver affiliate that his group has collected hundreds of reported NNP DNA samples . “ This DNA is IN nothing else in the NN , ” Paulides VBD about strands of hair from a reported NNP in Northern California . “ This is n’t an NN . This is a subspecies of a NN , and we VBP they travel in groups ."

As covered in Part 1 of this trilogy of articles , after NNS of questioning and research , I just attended my JJ UFO confab , the 31st Annual 2018 Ozark Mountain UFO Conference in Eureka Springs , Arkansas from April 12 - 14 . After Richard Dolan shared his views about “ UFOs and the NN : Disinformation or Disclosure ? ” the second presenter , astronomer Marc D’Antonio talked about “ Exoplanets and Alien NNP : What We VBP … ” which was a very down - to - NN – so to speak – explanation of how NN NNS VBP wavelengths of light to classify other planets . The tie -in to ufology is where visiting ETs ( extraterrestrials ) might hail from . Since we VBP that all suns are born and eventually die , wiping out planets in their systems , D’Antonio posed the interesting NN that ETs are here because their home planets were destroyed . It is worth mentioning that D’Antonio began his presentation by wondering if owls , which are often associated with UFO sighting and abduction NNS , are screen images of gray aliens ? JJ abductees report remembering JJ images after missing NN , only to find out later that the ETs had imprinted the other image ( owl ) to mask or screen the abductee ’s shocking experience . But D’Antonio ’s exciting NN regarded his roving Humvee with telescopes mounted to it which can VB ultraviolet to infrared ( RB to short wavelengths ) , beyond the light spectrum visible to NNS . Now the search for NNP can VB just about anywhere and record remote images of what is VBG on in the sky . For astronomers , this is exciting stuff . D’Antonio finished with a NNP Bang by unwinding a spool of “ toilet paper ” IN the audience to illustrate how most of NN on NN has appeared over lengthy NN periods – except us NNS , which have been IN NNP for a tiny sliver of the last sheet on the oversized paper roll : Next up was my personal journalistic hero and editor of Earthfiles , ace reporter , author , and television producer , the award - winning Linda Moulton Howe who led us on a ufological tour - de - force titled “ JJ Whistleblower Revelations about UFOs and an Alien Presence . ” Howe broke the story on bloodless cattle mutilations in the late 1980s and has been an avid researcher on All Things UFO since then . She told us this was her 30th appearance in Eureka Springs – out of 31 total conferences ! Here are the highlights of her fascinating narrative : – UFOs have been kept secret since British Prime Minister Winston Churchill told US NNP Harry Truman it had to be that NN or civilization MD crumble . UFOs posed an existential threat to humanity – they MD wipe us out if they so chose – so why panic the NN ? – The JJ NN from Antarctica is that the US NN has , for the past 15 NNS , been removing 13 - 33 CD - NN - JJ artifacts VBN CD and a half NNS below the NN . The NN is accessible only by submarine , and recent visits from NN leaders have something to do with the alien culture which originated these objects – whatever they are . The US NN wants to “ sanitize this physical evidence before presenting it to the NN . ” – The US NN now has the ability to monitor JJ brain patterns from satellite platforms . Howe VBD CD of her NNP sources told her , “ Your every breath is being tracked by the NNPS in Black . ” – A Japanese test of AI ( artificial intelligence ) robots using thought NN as a weapon went horribly wrong when 29 NNS were killed before all four robots MD be deactivated . NNS disabled CD of the robots , but the third began to repair them . The fourth robot reconnected itself to an orbiting satellite to repair itself . This is bad NN , and Howe quoted genius inventor and CEO of Exploration Technologies ( SpaceX ) Elon Musk as saying that NNS need to contain AI via legislation and regulation within the next four NNS or face the possibility that they MD become truly autonomous and become another existential threat . Musk VBD , “ AI is a fundamental NN to humankind . ” – Ironically , Musk is developing his own AI JJ NN , Neuralink , to develop bionic technologies “ for JJ enhancement . ” Coincidentally , he predicts that his NN will link JJ thought to AI devices in four NNS ( there ’s that number again ) . Computer - driven biological NN part replacement is under rapid NN . Soon , we MD be able to VB out a hand ( or a liver ) as easily as replacing the wheels or radiator on a car . – Howe concluded her remarks with a detailed analysis of an alleged briefing held March 6 - 8 , 1981 for newly - elected NNP Ronald Reagan . Then - NNP Director William Colby and a NN of NNP analysts and handlers gave the Commander - in - Chief “ need to VB ” intel about UFOs and ETs . Of the several NNS VBN at that NN , some were helpful , some neutral , and some adversarial . Reagan was especially interested to VB more about the most dangerous of the Hostile Alien Visitors ( HAVs ) , a race called the Trantaloids . Howe posed CD intriguing questions we can all ponder : 2. MD EBENs ( ETs ) save us if a killer asteroid were threatening NN on NNP with an extinction - level event IN the NN that killed all the dinosaurs ? The Visitors have technology advanced enough to destroy such an asteroid – but MD they VB a poor NN out ? The last presenter that JJ day was the “ father of modern ufology , ” nuclear scientist Stanton Friedman . This scholarly physicist explained the nuts - and - bolts of actual nuclear fission and fusion research and NN projects he participated in – most of which , he laughed , lost funding along the NN . The upside to short - lived projects was that Friedman became involved in a multitude of interesting NN and weapons projects – and he had the slides to prove it . Friedman maintains that both black and white operations have produced nuclear technologies capable of NN exploration . In a casual discussion at his book table ( absent his books which were in luggage lost in transit – IN so JJ of his projects , as he quipped – and delivered by the airline only on the last day of the conference , all of which promptly sold out ) , Friedman gave this sage piece of advice : “ Check your facts before you publish – because your critics will . ” Day 2 of the 2018 Ozark Mountain UFO Conference began , for me , with an engrossing talk on subjects I VBP almost nothing about : cryptozoology . Cryptozoologists seek to prove the existence of folkloric entities IN NNP and the Loch Ness Monster . Ufologist , History Channel program regular , and best - selling author , British - born < http://nickredfernfortean.blogspot.com/”> Nicholas “ Nick ” Redfern kept us spell - bound with “ The NNS and NNPS in Black : Do n’t Answer the Door ! ” Redfern traced the JJ report of a NNP in Black to Wales in 1909 . Residents witnessed strange “ balls of light ” overhead – UFOs . Oddly enough , after the incident , a NN dressed completely in black with a distinctive , brimmed hat drove a horse - and - carriage into town . The mysterious figure went from NN to NN , warning the occupants to keep quiet about what they had seen . Over the NNS , stories have circulated about NNS ( both NNS and NNS ) dressed in black , with black hair and often piercing black eyes showing up on experiencers ’ doorsteps – in broad daylight or the middle of the night . They never demand entry . Instead , they ask to be let in , using mind NN techniques . This is something you definitely do not VB to do : resist the urge to open that door . NNS who got close to the MIBs felt nauseous , drained of NN force , and sometimes felt IN their minds were being probed telepathically . Then , Redfern explored the possibility that Ouija boards open a portal to paranormal realms , particularly unsavory ( malefic or downright demonic ) ones . It turns out that Redfern is an expert on Mothman sightings , and he spent quite a bit of NN talking about the Slender NNP phenomenon . Slender NNP was a completely fictional character which won a Most Menacing Monster contest . The tall , faceless NN became very popular among horror fans , to the point where some claimed to have experienced encounters with an actual Slender NN . MD enough mass thought / belief actually create a brand - JJ paranormal enemy – from a potent thought - form ? I certainly had a lot to ponder , with some stellar speakers still to come ! Please join me for ( with a nod to Paul Harvey ) “ the rest of the story . ” To Be Continued in Part 3/3 RB here at The Daily NNP !"

But before he ever stepped NN on a movie set , Statham ’s NN was just as colorful as the characters he ’s played onscreen . From being an Olympic diver to fashion NN to RB having a side gig in the black NN , Statham amassed a unique set of skills that perfectly positioned him to be an action star . As of 2019 , Statham ’s net worth is estimated to be RB $ 50 CD . Statham once worked as a con artist , selling JJ perfume and stolen jewelry on the streets . "" That was street theater , "" Statham VBD in a 2007 interview with the Chicago Tribune . "" You work with a NN — some NNS in the crowd , some guys who stand lookout for the police . "" And that ’s how he met filmmaker Guy Ritchie , who was fascinated by Statham 's past . Ritchie invited him to audition for a part in Lock , Stock and CD Smoking Barrels . "" Guy had written a character that was the same as me , ” Statham VBD in an interview with Esquire magazine . “ And he VBD , ' I love it . Give me some of the patter . ' At the NN , I had loads of it . And he was fascinated with that , and he just wanted someone who was authentic . ” So RB though Statham had no acting experience or training , Richie cast him as Bacon , a central character who was attempting to VB easy NN to repay a huge gambling debt . In his next crime comedy , Snatch ( 2000 ) , Richie brought Statham on again , this NN as a petty criminal named Turkish who tries to VB a name for himself in underground boxing . Although the role was originally a minor NN — with headline - name actors including Brad Pitt and Benicio Del Toro , front and center — Statham 's role evolved substantially , and he became an unforgettable anti-hero . ' The Transporter , ' ' Crank , ' ' The Mechanic , ' & ' The Expendables ' Luc Besson then cast Statham in the titular role of 2002’s The Transporter , about a driver - for - hire — willing to deliver anything as RB as the price is JJ — until he gets involved in the kidnapping of a JJ woman who has ties to a dangerous NN ring . The NN was a huge hit , which established Statham as an action hero and spawned a sequel in 2005 . Statham has RB starred in the films Crank and its sequel , as well as The Mechanic and its CD sequel . In 2010 he joined the Sylvester Stallone and an all - star cast for The Expendables , The Expendables 2 ( 2012 ) and The Expendables 3 ( 2014 ) . ' The Fast and the Furious ' Franchise and ' Hobbs & Shaw ' In 2013 Statham joined an already established action franchise , The Fast and the Furious 6 and in CD , reprised his role in its eighth installment , The Fate of the Furious . He later paired with his erstwhile screen nemesis Dwayne Johnson for the launch of the spinoff Fast & Furious Presents : Hobbs & Shaw in 2019 . In the CD comedy ‘ Spy , ’ written and directed by Paul Feig , and starring Melissa McCarthy , Jude Law and Rose Byrne , Statham stands out as an anti-James Bond . Though Feig wrote the part of surly agent Rick Ford with Statham in mind , he told Forbes.com he never thought he MD accept the role . Staham concedes that he had some hesitation about it . “ You never VBP what you ’re getting into with a comedy , ” Statham VBD in an interview with Variety . “ But it helps to have a great director and Paul Feig is the Scorsese of comedy films . ” Statham is set to reprise his role in the upcoming sequel , Spy 2 . In August 2018 , Statham was back in theaters as the star of the sci - fi horror NN The Meg , about a 75 - NN prehistoric shark that terrorizes a submarine crew . Expected to flop , the NN instead proved a surprising hit , taking in $ 44.5 CD at the NNP JJ box office and another $ 97 CD overseas during its opening weekend . Since 1998 Statham has made more than 40 films , almost all of them in the action genre . Yet unlike JJ action stars , Statham is VBN for performing the vast majority his stunts . He has RB advocated for having stunt performers be included at the Oscars with a designated category . Jason Statham was born on July 26 , 1967 in Shirebrook , Derbyshire , to Eileen and Barry Statham . He had an older brother named Lee and both took interest in martial arts . But Jason had other athletic passions , CD of which was diving , and he began working on those skills , eventually becoming a part of the British Olympic NNP that traveled to Seoul , Korea in 1988 . After the Olympics , he continued as a member of the National Diving Squad for the next decade . However , after some disappointing finishes at the NNP Championships and Olympic NNS , he decided to focus on the next chapter of his career . A few NNS later , his athletic build caught the eye of a talent agent and landed Statham a gig in an ad NN for the JJ clothing retailer French Connection . An appearance in a Levi's Jeans commercial and work for Hilfiger followed and soon Statham had a modeling career . This helped him VB jobs as a background dancer in early '90s music videos IN The Shamen 's "" Comin ' On "" and Erasure 's "" Run to the NNP . "" Statham and supermodel Rosie Huntington - Whiteley began dating in 2011 , and together , had a son , Jack Oscar , in CD . The couple got engaged in CD ."

Or_CC go_VB to_IN Amazon.com_NNP ._.","As the Official Story of the 1980 October Surprise NN crumbles — with JJ revelations that key evidence was hidden from investigators of a congressional task force and that internal doubts were suppressed — history must finally confront the troubling impression that remains : that disgruntled elements of the NNP and Israel ’s Likud hardliners teamed up to remove a U.S. NN from office . Indeed , it is this disturbing conclusion — perhaps RB more than the idea of a Republican dirty trick — that MD explain the longstanding and determined cover - up of this political scandal . Too JJ powerful interests do not VB the JJ NNS to accept RB the possibility that U.S. intelligence operatives and a longtime ally MD intervene to oust a NN who had impinged on what those CD groups considered their vital interests . To accept that scenario MD mean that CD of the great fears of JJ democracy had come true — George Washington ’s warning against the dangers of “ entangling alliances ” and Harry Truman ’s concern that the clandestine operations of the NNP had the makings of an “ JJ Gestapo . ” It is far easier to assure the JJ NNS that no such thing MD occur , that Israel ’s Likud — whatever its differences with Washington over Middle East peace policies — MD never seek to subvert a U.S. NN , and that NNP dissidents — no matter how frustrated by political constraints — MD never sabotage their own NN . But the evidence points in that direction , and there are some points that are not in dispute . For instance , there is no doubt that NNP NNP Boys and Likudniks had strong motives for seeking NNP Jimmy Carter ’s defeat in 1980 . Inside the NNP , Carter and his NNP Director Stansfield Turner were blamed for firing JJ of the free - wheeling covert operatives from the Vietnam era , for ousting legendary spymaster Ted Shackley , and for failing to protect longtime U.S. allies ( and friends of the NNP ) , such as Iran ’s Shah and Nicaragua ’s dictator Anastasio Somoza . As for Israel , Likud Prime Minister Menachem Begin was furious over Carter ’s high - handed actions at Camp David in 1978 forcing Israel to trade the occupied Sinai to Egypt for a peace deal . Begin feared that Carter MD VB his second term to bully Israel into accepting a Palestinian NN on West Bank lands that Likud considered part of Israel ’s divinely granted territory . JJ Mossad and Foreign Ministry official David Kimche described Begin ’s attitude in his 1991 book , The Last Option , saying that Israeli officials had gotten wind of “ collusion ” between Carter and Egyptian NNP Anwar Sadat “ to force Israel to abandon her refusal to withdraw from territories occupied in 1967 , including Jerusalem , and to agree to the establishment of a Palestinian NN . ” Kimche continued , “ This plan — prepared behind Israel ’s back and without her knowledge — must rank as a unique attempt in NNP NNPS ’s diplomatic history of short - changing a friend and ally by deceit and manipulation . ” However , Begin recognized that the scheme required Carter winning a second term in 1980 when , Kimche wrote , “ he MD be free to compel Israel to accept a settlement of the Palestinian problem on his and Egyptian terms , without having to fear the backlash of the JJ Jewish lobby . ” In his 1992 memoir , Profits of NNP , Ari Ben-Menashe , an Israeli JJ intelligence officer who worked with Likud , agreed that Begin and other Likud leaders held Carter in contempt . “ Begin loathed Carter for the peace agreement forced upon him at Camp David , ” Ben-Menashe wrote . “ As Begin saw it , the agreement took away Sinai from Israel , did not create a comprehensive peace , and left the Palestinian issue hanging on Israel ’s back . ” So , in order to buy NN for Israel to “ VB the facts on the ground ” by moving Jewish settlers into the West Bank , Begin felt Carter ’s reelection had to be prevented . A different NN RB presumably MD give Israel a freer hand to deal with problems on its northern border with Lebanon . As for the NNP NNP Boys , legendary NNP officer NNP Copeland told me that “ the NNP within the NNP ” — the inner-most circle of powerful intelligence figures who felt they understood best the strategic needs of the NNP NNPS — believed Carter and his naïve faith in JJ democratic ideals represented a grave threat to the nation . “ Carter RB believed in all the principles that we talk about in the West , ” Copeland VBD , shaking his mane of white hair . “ As smart as Carter is , he did VB in Mom , apple pie and the corner NN NN . And those things that are good in NNP are good everywhere else . … “ Carter , I VBP , was not a stupid NN , ” Copeland VBD , adding that Carter had an RB worse flaw : “ He was a principled NN . ” These attitudes of “ the NNP within the NNP ” and the Likudniks appear to stem from their genuine beliefs that they needed to protect what they regarded as vital interests of their respective NNS . The NNP NNP Boys thought they understood the true strategic needs of the NNP NNPS and Likud believed fervently in a “ Greater Israel . ” However , the lingering October Surprise mystery is whether these CD groups followed their strongly held feelings into a treacherous bid , in NN with Republicans , to prevent Carter from gaining the release of 52 hostages then held in Iran and thus torpedoing his reelection hopes . Carter ’s inability to resolve that hostage NN did set the stage for Ronald Reagan ’s landslide victory in November 1980 as JJ voters reacted to the JJ - running hostage humiliation by turning to a candidate they believed MD be a tougher player on the international stage . Reagan ’s macho image was reinforced when the Iranians released the hostages immediately after he was inaugurated on Jan. 20 , 1981 , ending the 444 - day standoff . The coincidence of timing , which Reagan ’s supporters cited as proof that foreign enemies feared the JJ NN , gave momentum to Reagan ’s larger agenda , including sweeping NN cuts tilted toward the wealthy , reduced NN regulation of corporations , and renewed reliance on fossil fuels . ( Carter ’s solar panels were pointedly dismantled from the White NNP roof . ) Reagan ’s victory RB was great NN for NNP cold - warriors who were rewarded with the choice of NNP NNP II spymaster ( and dedicated cold - warrior ) William Casey to be NNP director . Casey then purged NNP analysts who were detecting a declining Soviet Union that desired détente and replaced them with NNS IN the JJ and ambitious Robert NNP , who agreed that the Soviets were on the march and that the NNP NNPS needed a massive JJ expansion to counter them . Further , Casey again embraced JJ - NN NNP swashbuckling in Third NNP NNS and took pleasure in misleading or bullying members of Congress when they insisted on the NNP oversight that had been forced on NNP Gerald Ford and had been accepted by NNP Carter . To Casey , NNP oversight became a NN of hide and seek . As for Israel , Begin was pleased to find the Reagan administration far less demanding about peace deals with the Arabs , giving Israel NN to expand its West Bank settlements . Reagan and his NN RB acquiesced to Israel ’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982 , a drive NN that expelled the Palestine Liberation Organization but RB led to the slaughters at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps . And , behind the scenes , Reagan gave a JJ light to Israeli weapons shipments to Iran ( which was fighting a NN with Israel ’s greater enemy , Iraq ) . The weapons NNS helped Israel rebuild its contacts inside Iran and to turn JJ profits , which were then VBN to VB finance West Bank settlements . In another important move , Reagan credentialed a JJ generation of pro-Israeli JJ ideologues VBN as the neoconservatives , a move that MD pay JJ dividends for Israel in the future as these bright and articulate operatives fought for Israeli interests both inside the U.S. NN and through their opinion - leading roles in the major JJ NN NN . In other words , if the disgruntled NNP NNP Boys and the determined Likudniks did participate in an October Surprise scheme to unseat Jimmy Carter , they surely got much of what they were after . Yet , while motive is an important element in solving a mystery , it does not constitute proof by itself . What must be examined is whether there is evidence that the motive was acted upon , whether Menachem Begin ’s NN and disgruntled NNP officers covertly assisted the Reagan - Bush NN in contacting Iranian officials to thwart Carter ’s hostage negotiations . On that point the evidence is strong though perhaps not ironclad . Still , a well - supported narrative does exist describing how the October Surprise scheme MD have gone down with the NN of NNP personnel , Begin ’s NN , some JJ - wing intelligence figures in Europe , and a handful of other NN brokers in the NNP NNPS . RB before Iran took the JJ hostages on Nov. 4 , 1979 , disgruntled NNP veterans had been lining up behind the presidential candidacy of their JJ boss , George H.W. Bush . Casting off their traditional cloak of non-partisanship and anonymity , they were volunteering as NN soldiers in Bush ’s NN . CD joke about Bush ’s announcement of his candidacy on NNP 1 , 1979 , was that “ half the audience was wearing raincoats . ” Bill Colby , Bush ’s predecessor as NNP director , VBD Bush “ had a flood of NNS from the NNP who joined his supporters . They were retirees devoted to him for what he had done ” in defending the spy agency in 1976 when the NNP came under heavy criticism for spying on Americans , assassination plots and other abuses . Reagan ’s foreign policy adviser Richard Allen described the group working on the Bush NN as a “ plane load of disgruntled JJ NNP ” officers who were “ playing cops and robbers . ” All told , at least CD dozen JJ NNP officials went to work for Bush . Among them was the NNP ’s director of security , Robert Gambino , who joined the Bush NN immediately after leaving the NNP where he oversaw security investigations of senior Carter officials and thus knew about potentially damaging personal information . Besides the ex-CIA personnel who joined the Bush NN , other pro-Bush intelligence officers remained inside the NNP while making clear their political preference . “ The seventh floor of Langley was plastered with ‘ Bush for NNP ’ signs , ” VBD senior NNP analyst George Carver , referring to the floor that housed senior NNP officials . Carter administration officials RB grew concerned about the deep personal ties between the JJ NNP officers in Bush ’s NN and active - duty NNP personnel who continued to hold sensitive jobs under Carter . For instance , Gambino , the 25 - NN NNP veteran who oversaw personnel security checks , and NNP officer Donald Gregg , who served as a NNP representative on Carter ’s National Security Council , “ are good friends who knew each other from the NNP , ” according to an unpublished part of a report by a NNP task force that investigated the October Surprise issue in 1992 . [ I VBD this deleted section — still marked “ secret ” — in unpublished task force files in 1994 . ] Perhaps most significantly , Bush quietly enlisted Theodore Shackley , the legendary NNP covert operations specialist VBN as the “ blond ghost . ” During the Cold NNP , Shackley had run JJ of the NNP ’s most controversial paramilitary operations , from Vietnam and Laos to the JMWAVE operations against Fidel Castro ’s Cuba . In those operations , Shackley had supervised the work of hundreds of NNP officers and developed powerful bonds of loyalty with JJ of his subordinates . For instance , Donald Gregg had served under Shackley ’s command in Vietnam . When Bush was NNP director in 1976 , he appointed Shackley to a top clandestine job , associate deputy director for operations , laying the foundation for Shackley ’s possible rise to director and cementing Shackley ’s loyalty to Bush . When Shackley had a falling out with Carter ’s NNP Director Turner in 1979 , Shackley quit the agency . Privately , Shackley believed that Turner had devastated the agency by pushing out hundreds of covert officers , JJ of them Shackley ’s JJ subordinates . By early 1980 , the Republicans RB were complaining that they were being kept in the dark about progress on the Iran hostage negotiations . George Cave , then a top NNP specialist on Iran , told me that the “ Democrats never briefed the Republicans ” on sensitive developments , creating suspicions among the Republicans . So , the Republicans sought out their own sources of information regarding the hostage NN . Shackley began monitoring Carter ’s progress on negotiations through his contacts with Iranians in Europe , Cave VBD . “ Ted , I VBP , had a couple of contacts in Germany , ” VBD Cave . “ I VBP he talked to them . I do n’t VB how far it went . … Ted was very active on that thing in the winter / spring of 1980 . ” Author David Corn RB got wind of the Shackley - Bush connection when he was researching his biography of Shackley , Blond Ghost . “ Within the spook NN the belief spread that Shackley was close to Bush , ” Corn wrote . “ Rafael Quintero [ an anti-Castro Cuban with close ties to the NNP ] was saying that Shackley met with Bush every week . He told CD associate that should Reagan and Bush triumph , Shackley was considered a potential DCI , ” the abbreviation for NNP director . Some of the legendary NNP officers from an RB earlier generation , those who had helped overthrow Iran ’s elected NN in 1953 and put the Shah on the Peacock Throne , RB injected themselves into the hostage NN . NNP Copeland , CD of the agency ’s JJ Middle East hands , claimed in his memoir , The NNP Player , that he and his NNP chums pondered their own hostage rescue plan while organizing an informal support group for the Bush NN , called “ Spooks for Bush . ” In a 1990 interview , Copeland told me that “ the NN we saw Washington at that NN was that the struggle was RB not between the Left and the NNP , the liberals and the conservatives , as between the Utopians and the realists , the pragmatists . “ Carter was a Utopian . He believed , honestly , that you must do the JJ thing and take your chance on the consequences . He told me that . He literally believed that . ” Copeland ’s deep Southern accent spit out the words with a mixture of amazement and disgust . Copeland ’s contacts at the NN included NNP veteran Archibald Roosevelt and JJ Secretary of NNP Henry Kissinger — both of whom were close to David Rockefeller whose Chase Manhattan Bank handled billions of dollars in the Shah ’s accounts , a fortune that the Iranian mullahs wanted to lay their hands on . “ There were JJ of us — myself along with Henry Kissinger , David Rockefeller , Archie Roosevelt in the NNP at the NN — we believed very strongly that we were showing a kind of weakness , which NNS in Iran and elsewhere in the NN hold in great contempt , ” Copeland VBD . As Copeland and his friends contemplated what to do regarding the hostage NN , he reached out to other of his JJ NNP buddies . According to The NNP Player , Copeland turned to ex-CIA counter - intelligence chief James Angleton . The famed spy hunter “ brought to lunch a Mossad chap who confided that his service had identified at least half of the ‘ students , ’ RB to the extent of having their home addresses in Tehran , ” Copeland wrote . “ He gave me a rundown on what sort of kids they were . Most of them , he VBD , were just that , kids . ” CD of the JJ Israeli intelligence agents assigned to the task of figuring out who was who in the JJ Iranian NN structure was Ari Ben-Menashe , who was born in Iran but emigrated to Israel as a teen - ager . Not only did he speak fluent Farsi , but he had school friends who were rising within the JJ revolutionary bureaucracy . In his memoir , Profits of NNP , Ben-Menashe offered his own depiction of Copeland ’s initiative . Though Copeland was generally regarded as a NNP “ Arabist ” who had opposed Israeli interests in the past , he was admired for his analytical skills , Ben-Menashe wrote . “ A meeting between NNP Copeland and Israeli intelligence officers was held at a Georgetown NN in Washington , D.C. , ” Ben-Menashe wrote . “ The Israelis were happy to deal with any initiative but Carter’s . “ David Kimche , chief of Tevel , the foreign relations unit of Mossad , was the senior Israeli at the meeting . … The Israelis and the Copeland group came up with a CD - pronged plan to VB quiet diplomacy with the Iranians and to draw up a scheme for JJ action against Iran that MD not jeopardize the lives of the hostages . ” In late February 1980 , Seyeed Mehdi Kashani , an Iranian emissary , arrived in Israel to discuss Iran ’s growing desperation for spare parts for its U.S. - supplied NN force , Ben-Menashe wrote . Kashani , whom Ben-Menashe had VBN from their school days in Tehran , RB revealed that the Copeland initiative was making inroads inside Iran and that approaches from some Republican emissaries had already been received , Ben-Menashe wrote . “ Kashani VBD that the secret ex-CIA - NNP - Copeland group was aware that any deal cut with the Iranians MD have to include the Israelis because they MD have to be VBN as a third party to sell JJ equipment to Iran , ” according to Ben-Menashe . In March 1980 , the following month , the Israelis made their JJ direct JJ shipment to Iran , 300 tires for Iran ’s F - 4 fighter jets , Ben-Menashe wrote . Ben-Menashe ’s account of these early Israeli arms shipments was corroborated by Carter ’s press secretary Jody Powell and Israeli arms dealer William Northrop . In an interview for a 1991 PBS “ Frontline ” documentary , Jody Powell told me that “ there had been a rather tense discussion between NNP Carter and Prime Minister Begin in the spring of 1980 in which the NNP made clear that the Israelis had to stop that [ arms dealing ] , and that we knew that they were doing it , and that we MD not allow it to continue , at least not allow it to continue privately and without the knowledge of the JJ NNS . ” “ And it stopped , ” Powell VBD . At least , it stopped temporarily . Meanwhile , Carter RB was learning that Begin was siding with the Republicans . Questioned by congressional investigators in 1992 , Carter VBD he realized by April 1980 that “ Israel cast their lot with Reagan , ” according to notes I VBD among the unpublished documents in the files of a NNP task force that had looked into the October Surprise NN . Carter traced the Israeli opposition to his reelection to a “ lingering concern [ among ] Jewish leaders that I was too friendly with Arabs . ” The NNP RB MD have had political enemies close to his inner circle . Jamshid Hashemi , an Iranian businessman who was recruited by the NNP in January 1980 along with his brother Cyrus , VBD that in spring 1980 , he encountered Donald Gregg , the NNP officer serving on Carter ’s National Security Council staff , at Cyrus ’s Manhattan office . Jamshid Hashemi VBD his brother Cyrus was playing a double NN , officially helping the Carter administration on the hostage NN but privately collaborating with the Republicans . [ For details , VB Robert Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ] The alleged involvement of Gregg is another highly controversial part of the October Surprise mystery . A tall NN with an easy - VBG manner , Gregg had VBN George H.W. Bush since 1967 when Bush was a JJ - term U.S. congressman . Gregg RB briefed Bush when he was U.S. envoy to China . Gregg served , too , as the NNP ’s liaison to the Pike Committee investigation when Bush was NNP director . “ Although Gregg was uniformly regarded as a competent professional , there was a dimension to his background that was entirely unknown to his colleagues at the White NNP , and that was his acquaintance with CD of the Republican frontrunners , George Bush , ” JJ Carter NSC official Gary Sick wrote in his book October Surprise . As the Iran NN dragged on , Copeland and his group of NNP NNP Boys forwarded their own plan for freeing the hostages . However , to Copeland ’s chagrin , his plan fell on deaf ears inside the Carter administration , which was developing its own rescue operation . So , Copeland told me that he distributed his plan outside the administration , to leading Republicans , giving sharper focus to their contempt for Carter ’s bungled Iranian strategy . “ Officially , the plan went only to NNS in the NN and was top secret and all that , ” Copeland VBD . “ But as so often happens in NN , PRP wants support , and when it was not being handled by the Carter administration as though it was top secret , it was handled as though it was nothing . … Yes , I sent copies to everybody who I thought MD be a good ally . … “ Now I ’m not at liberty to VB what reaction , if any , ex-President [ Richard ] Nixon took , but he certainly had a copy of this . We sent CD to Henry Kissinger . … So we had these informal relationships where the little closed circle of NNS who were , a , looking forward to a Republican NNP within a short while and , b , who were absolutely trustworthy and who understood all these inner workings of the international NN board . ” Encircled by a growing legion of enemies , the Carter administration put the finishing touches on its hostage - rescue operation in April . Code - named “ Eagle Claw , ” the assault involved a force of U.S. helicopters that MD swoop down on Tehran , coordinate with some agents on the ground and extract the hostages . Carter ordered the operation to proceed on April 24 , but mechanical problems forced the helicopters to turn back . At a staging area called Desert CD , CD of the helicopters collided with a refueling plane , causing an explosion that killed eight JJ crewmen . Their charred bodies were then displayed by the Iranian NN , adding to the fury and humiliation of the NNP NNPS . After the Desert CD fiasco , the Iranians dispersed the hostages to a variety of locations , effectively shutting the door on another rescue attempt . By summer 1980 , Copeland told me , the Republicans in his circle considered a second hostage - rescue attempt not only unfeasible , but unnecessary . They were talking confidently about the hostages being freed after a Republican victory in November , the JJ NNP NN VBD . “ Nixon , IN everybody else , knew that all we had to do was wait until the NN came , and they were VBG to VB out , ” Copeland VBD . “ That was sort of an open secret among NNS in the intelligence community , that that MD happen . … The intelligence community certainly had some understanding with somebody in Iran in authority , in a NN that they MD hardly confide in me . ” Copeland VBD his NNP friends had been told by contacts in Iran that the mullahs MD do nothing to VB Carter or his reelection . “ At that NN , we had word back , because you always have informed relations with the devil , ” Copeland VBD . “ But we had word that , ‘ Do n’t worry . ’ As RB as Carter MD n’t VB credit for getting these NNS out , as soon as Reagan came in , the Iranians MD be happy enough to wash their hands of this and move into a JJ era of Iranian - JJ relations , whatever that turned out to be . ” In the interview , Copeland declined to give more details , beyond his assurance that “ the NNP within the NNP , ” his term for the true protectors of U.S. national security , had an understanding with the Iranians about the hostages . ( Copeland died on Jan. 14 , 1991 . ) In summer 1980 , Ronald Reagan wrapped up the Republican nomination and offered the vice presidential slot to his JJ rival , George H.W. Bush . As Bush ’s NN merged with Reagan ’s NN , so too did Bush ’s contingent of NNP veterans . Reagan ’s NN director William Casey — a spymaster for the NNP NNP II - era Office of Strategic Services — RB blended in well with the ex-intelligence officers . JJ of the October Surprise allegations have Casey and his longtime business associate John Shaheen , another OSS veteran , meeting with Iranians and other foreigners overseas . Casey RB had secret meetings with Kissinger , according to Casey ’s chauffeur , and with banker David Rockefeller and ex-CIA officer Archibald Roosevelt , who had gone to work for Rockefeller , according to the Sept. 11 , 1980 , visitor log at the Reagan - Bush headquarters in Arlington , Virginia . On Sept. 16 , 1980 , five days after the Rockefeller group ’s visit to Casey ’s office , Iran ’s acting foreign minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh spoke publicly about Republican interference . “ Reagan , supported by Kissinger and others , has no intention of resolving the problem ” with the hostages , Ghotbzadeh VBD . “ They will do everything in their NN to block it . ” Iranian NNP Abolhassan Bani-Sadr held a similar opinion from his position in Tehran . In a 1992 letter to the NNP task force on the October Surprise NN , Bani - Sadr wrote that he learned of the Republican back - channel initiative in summer 1980 and received a message from an emissary of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini : The Reagan NN was in NN with pro-Republican elements of the NNP in an effort to undermine Carter and wanted Iran ’s NN . Bani-Sadr VBD the emissary “ told me that if I do not accept this proposal they [ the Republicans ] MD VB the same offer to my rivals . ” The emissary added that the Republicans “ have enormous influence in the NNP , ” Bani -Sadr wrote . “ Lastly , he told me my refusal of their offer MD result in my elimination . ” Bani-Sadr VBD he resisted the GOP scheme , but the plan ultimately was accepted by Ayatollah Khomeini , who appeared to have made up his mind IN the NN of Iraq ’s invasion of Iran in mid-September 1980 . However , still sensing a political danger if Carter got the Iranians to VB their minds , the Republicans opened the final full month of the NN by trying to VB Carter ’s hostage talks look IN a cynical ploy to influence the NN ’s outcome . On Oct. 2 , Republican vice - presidential candidate Bush brought up the issue with a group of reporters : “ CD thing that ’s at the back of everybody ’s mind is , ‘ What can Carter do that is so sensational and so flamboyant , if you will , on his side to pull off an October Surprise ? ’ And everybody kind of speculates about it , but there ’s not a darn thing we can do about it , nor is there any strategy we can do except possibly have it discounted . ” CD congressional investigator who was involved in the Iran - Contra and the October Surprise inquiries told me recently that his conclusion was that the Republicans were pursuing every avenue possible to reach the Iranian leadership to VB sure Carter ’s hostage negotiations failed . JJ Israeli intelligence officer Ben-Menashe , in his book and in sworn testimony , VBD the ultimately successful channel was CD involving both JJ and current NNP officers , working with French intelligence for the security of a final meeting in Paris and with Israelis who were given the task of delivering the payoff in weapons shipments and NN to Iran . The key meeting allegedly occurred on the weekend of Oct. 18 - CD , 1980 , between high - level representatives of the Republican NN and the Iranians . Ben -Menashe VBD he was part of a six - member Israeli support delegation for the meeting at the Ritz Hotel in Paris . In his memoir , Ben-Menashe VBD he recognized several Americans , including Republican congressional aide Robert McFarlane and NNP officers Robert NNP ( who had served on Carter ’s NSC staff and was then NNP Director Turner ’s executive assistant ) , Donald Gregg ( another NNP designee to Carter ’s NSC ) and George Cave ( the agency ’s Iran expert ) . Ben -Menashe VBD Iranian cleric Mehdi Karrubi , then a top foreign policy aide to Ayatollah Khomeini , arrived and walked into a conference room . “ A few minutes later George Bush , with the wispy - haired William Casey in front of him , stepped out of the elevator . He smiled , VBD hello to everyone , and , IN Karrubi , hurried into the conference room , ” Ben-Menashe wrote . Ben-Menashe VBD the Paris meetings served to finalize a previously outlined agreement calling for release of the 52 hostages in exchange for $ 52 CD , guarantees of arms NNS for Iran , and unfreezing of Iranian monies in U.S. banks . The timing , however , was changed , he VBD , to coincide with Reagan ’s expected Inauguration on Jan. 20 , 1981 . Though the alleged participants have denied taking part in such a meeting , the alibis cited by the Americans have proved porous . For instance , Gregg produced a photograph of himself in a bathing suit on a beach with the processing date stamped on the back , “ October 1980 . ” There have been others reasons to doubt their innocence . An NNP polygrapher working for Iran - Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh ’s investigation asked Gregg in 1990 , “ were you ever involved in a plan to delay the release of the hostages in Iran until after the 1980 Presidential NN ? ” Gregg ’s negative answer was deemed deceptive . [ VB the Final Report of the Independent Counsel for Iran / Contra Matters , Vol. I , 501 ] Meanwhile , other evidence has surfaced supporting Ben-Menashe ’s testimony . For instance , Chicago Tribune reporter John Maclean , son of author Norman Maclean who wrote A River Runs Through It , confirmed that he was told by a well - placed Republican source on that weekend in October 1980 that Bush was flying to Paris for a clandestine meeting with a delegation of Iranians about the JJ hostages . David Andelman , the biographer for Count Alexandre deMarenches , then head of France ’s Service de Documentation Exterieure NNP de Contre - Espionage ( SDECE ) , testified to the NNP task force that deMarenches told him that he had helped the Reagan - Bush NN arrange meetings with Iranians on the hostage issue in summer and fall of 1980 , with CD meeting in Paris in October . Andelman VBD deMarenches insisted that the secret meetings be kept out of his memoir because the story MD otherwise damage the reputations of his friends , William Casey and George H.W. Bush . The allegations of a Paris meeting RB received support from several other sources , including pilot Heinrich Rupp , who VBD he flew Casey from Washington ’s National Airport to Paris on a flight that left very late on a rainy night in mid-October 1980 . Rupp VBD that after arriving at LeBourget airport outside Paris , he saw a NN resembling Bush on the tarmac . The night of Oct. 18 indeed was rainy in the Washington area . RB , sign - in sheets at the Reagan - Bush headquarters in Arlington , Virginia , placed Casey within a five - minute drive of National Airport late that evening . There were other bits and pieces of corroboration about the Paris meetings . A French arms dealer , Nicholas Ignatiew , told me in 1990 that he had checked with his NN contacts and was told that Republicans did meet with Iranians in Paris in mid-October 1980 . A well - connected French investigative reporter Claude Angeli VBD his sources inside the French secret service confirmed that the service provided “ cover ” for a meeting between Republicans and Iranians in France on the weekend of October 18 - CD . German journalist Martin Kilian had received a similar account from a top aide to intelligence chief deMarenches . As early as 1987 , Iran ’s ex-President Bani-Sadr had made similar claims about a Paris meeting . Finally , a classified report from the Russian NN regarding what its intelligence files showed about the October Surprise issue stated matter - of - factly that Republicans held a series of meetings with Iranians in Europe , including CD in Paris in October 1980 . “ William Casey , in 1980 , met three times with representatives of the Iranian leadership , ” the Russian report VBD . “ The meetings took place in Madrid and Paris . ” At the Paris meeting in October 1980 , “ R[obert ] NNP , at that NN a staffer of the National Security Council in the administration of Jimmy Carter , and JJ NNP Director George Bush RB took part , ” the report VBD . “ In Madrid and Paris , the representatives of Ronald Reagan and the Iranian leadership discussed the question of possibly delaying the release of 52 hostages from the staff of the U.S. Embassy in Teheran . ” ( The Russian report had been requested by Rep. Lee Hamilton , D - Indiana , as part of the 1992 task force investigation of the October Surprise NN . It arrived on Jan. 11 , 1993 , just CD days before the task force was to release its own report rejecting the October Surprise suspicions . Despite the alleged Paris agreement , the Reagan - Bush NN remained nervous about the possibility that Carter might still arrange a pre-election hostage release . The Reagan - Bush NN maintained a 24 - hour Operations Center , which monitored press wires and reports , gave daily press briefings and maintained telephone and telefax contact with the candidate ’s plane , according to a secret draft report of the NNP task force , which added : “ JJ of the staff members were JJ NNP employees who had previously worked on the Bush NN or were otherwise loyal to George Bush . ” Bush and Shackley took personal responsibility for making sure the Republican NN was not caught off guard . According to Richard Allen ’s handwritten notes for Oct. 27 , 1980 , Bush called Allen at 2:12 p.m. as Bush was heading off to VB in Pittsburgh . Bush had gotten an unsettling message from JJ Texas Gov. John Connally , the ex-Democrat who had switched to the Republican Party during the Nixon administration . Connally VBD his NN contacts in the Middle East were buzzing with rumors that Carter had achieved the JJ - elusive breakthrough on the hostages . Bush ordered Allen to find out what he MD about Connally ’s tip . Allen was to pass on any JJ details to CD of Bush ’s aides . According to the notes , Allen was to relay the information to “ Ted Shacklee [ sic ] via Jennifer . ” In a “ secret ” 1992 deposition to the NNP October Surprise task force , Allen VBD the Jennifer was Jennifer Fitzgerald , Bush ’s longtime assistant including during his NN as director of the NNP . Allen testified that “ Shacklee ” was Theodore Shackley , the famous NNP covert operations specialist , the “ blond ghost . ” Yet , despite the last - minute GOP worries , Carter failed to VB the hostages out . The coincidence that the anniversary of the hostage - taking fell on NNP Day 1980 further damaged Carter ’s hopes as Americans were forced to relive the humiliations of the previous NN . Reagan romped to victory in a landslide , winning 44 NNS and bringing with him a Republican Senate . Among the Democrat casualties were key figures in efforts to rein in the powers of the imperial presidency — and of the NNP — including Frank Church of Idaho , Birch Bayh of Indiana and George McGovern of NNP Dakota . In retrospect , some of Carter ’s negotiators felt they should have been much more attentive to the possibility of Republican sabotage . “ Looking back , the Carter administration appears to have been far too trusting and particularly blind to the intrigue swirling IN it , ” VBD JJ NSC official Gary Sick . As the Inauguration neared , Republicans talked tough , making clear that Ronald Reagan MD n’t stand for the humiliation that the nation endured under Jimmy Carter . The Reagan - Bush NN intimated that Reagan MD deal harshly with Iran if it did n’t surrender the hostages . A joke making the rounds of Washington went : “ What ’s three NNS deep and glows in the dark ? Teheran ten minutes after Ronald Reagan becomes NNP . ” On Inauguration Day , Jan. 20 , 1981 , just as Reagan was beginning his inaugural address , word came from Iran that the hostages were freed . The JJ NNS were overjoyed . Privately , some Reagan insiders laughed about their October Surprise success . For instance , Charles Cogan , a high - ranking NNP officer , told the NNP task force in 1992 that he attended a 1981 meeting at NNP headquarters between Casey and CD of David Rockefeller ’s top aides , Joseph V. Reed , who had been appointed to be Ambassador to Morocco . Cogan testified that Reed joked about having blocked Carter ’s hostage release . A task force investigator , who spoke with Cogan in a less formal setting , VBD Reed ’s wording was , “ We fucked Carter ’s October Surprise . ” In the months and the NNS that followed , JJ of the key figures in the October Surprise mystery saw their career paths veer steeply upward . Besides Casey ’s appointment to head the NNP , Gregg became Vice NNP Bush ’s national security adviser . Robert McFarlane later became Reagan ’s NSC adviser . Though relatively JJ , Robert NNP vaulted up the NNP ’s career ladder , becoming head of the analytical division and then deputy director . ( He is now Barack Obama ’s Secretary of Defense . ) As for Israel and Iran , the arms network flowed with weapons to Iran and millions of dollars in profits back to Israel , with some of the NN VBG build JJ settlements in the West Bank . In summer 1981 , this hidden Israeli - Iranian pipeline slipped briefly into JJ view . On July 18 , 1981 , an Israeli - chartered planes was shot down after straying over the Soviet Union . In a PBS interview nearly a decade later , Nicholas Veliotes , Reagan ’s assistant secretary of NN for the Middle East , VBD he looked into the incident by talking to top administration officials who insisted that the NNP Department issue misleading guidance to the press . “ It was clear to me after my conversations with NNS on high that indeed we had agreed that the Israelis MD transship to Iran some JJ - origin JJ equipment , ” Veliotes VBD . In checking out the Israeli flight , Veliotes came to VB that the Reagan camp ’s dealings with Iran dated back to before the 1980 NN . “ It seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the NN of 1980 , as the Israelis had identified who MD become the JJ NNS in the national security area in the Reagan administration , ” Veliotes VBD . “ And I understand some contacts were made at that NN . ” In the mid-1980s , JJ of the same October Surprise actors became figures in the Iran - Contra scandal , another secret arms - for - hostages scheme with Iran that was revealed in late 1986 , despite White NNP denials . According to official Iran- Contra investigations , the plot to sell U.S. weapons to Iran for its NN in freeing JJ hostages then held in Lebanon involved Cyrus Hashemi , John Shaheen , Theodore Shackley , William Casey , Donald Gregg , Robert NNP , Robert McFarlane , George Cave , Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush . Yet , RB as the cover -up of the Iran - Contra operations crumbled , key figures in Washington battled to keep the RB more explosive October Surprise suspicions relegated to the loony bin of NN NNS , not to be taken seriously by the JJ NNS . By the NN the October Surprise NN was gaining traction in 1991 , neoconservatives had established themselves as important gatekeepers in the U.S. NN NN . Controversies that threatened to put Israel and Likud in a negative light were hotly contested . So , in fall 1991 , as Congress was deliberating whether to conduct full investigations of the October Surprise issue , Steven Emerson , a journalist with close ties to Likud , produced a cover story for the neoconservative NNP Republic claiming to prove the allegations were a “ myth . ” Almost simultaneously , Newsweek published its own cover story RB attacking the October Surprise allegations . The article , I was told , had been ordered up by executive editor Maynard Parker who was a close associate of Henry Kissinger and was VBN inside Newsweek as a JJ admirer of prominent neocon Elliott Abrams . The CD articles were influential in shaping Washington ’s conventional wisdom , but they were both VBN on a misreading of attendance documents at a London historical conference which William Casey had gone to in July 1980 . The CD publications put Casey at the conference on CD key date — thus supposedly proving he MD not have attended CD of the Madrid meetings with Iranian emissaries . However , after the CD stories appeared , follow - up interviews with conference participants , including historian Robert Dallek , conclusively showed that Casey was n’t there . Veteran journalist Craig Unger , who had worked on the Newsweek cover story , VBD the magazine knew the Casey alibi was bogus but still VBD it . “ It was the most dishonest thing that I ’ve been through in my NN in journalism , ” Unger later told me . However , RB though the Newsweek and NNP Republic stories had themselves been debunked , that did n’t stop other neoconservative - dominated publications , IN the Wall Street Journal , from ladling out ridicule on anyone who dared take the October Surprise NN seriously . Emerson RB was a close friend of Michael Zeldin , the deputy chief counsel for the NNP investigative task force . Though the task force jettisoned Emerson ’s bogus Casey alibi , NNP investigators told me that Emerson frequently visited the task force ’s offices and advised Zeldin and others how to read the October Surprise evidence . Subsequent examinations of Emerson ’s peculiar brand of journalism ( which invariably toed the Likud line and often demonized Muslims ) revealed that Emerson had JJ ties to JJ - wing funders such as Richard Mellon Scaife and had hosted JJ - wing Israeli intelligence commander Yigal Carmon when Carmon came to Washington to lobby against Middle East peace talks . In 1999 , a NN of Emerson ’s history by John F. Sugg for Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting ’s magazine “ Extra ! ” quoted an Associated Press reporter who had worked with Emerson on a project as saying of Emerson and Carmon : “ I have no doubt these guys are working together . ” The Jerusalem Post reported that Emerson has “ close ties to Israeli intelligence . ” And “ Victor Ostrovsky , who defected from Israel ’s Mossad intelligence agency and has written books disclosing its secrets , calls Emerson ‘ the horn ’ — because he trumpets Mossad claims , ” Sugg reported . Besides Emerson ’s cozy relationship with task force deputy counsel Zeldin , Zeldin ’s boss , chief counsel Lawrence Barcella , was a close personal friend of another influential neocon , Michael Ledeen , who was linked to the October Surprise mystery in the secret draft report prepared by Barcella ’s staff . However , after speaking with Ledeen , Barcella deleted references to his friend from the final report , the NN that was issued publicly . [ VB Consortiumnews.com ’s “ October Surprise Crystal Ball . ” ] Barcella RB was the NN inside the task force who apparently decided to withhold the damning Russian report from task force chairman Lee Hamilton . In other words , a key “ journalist ” who supposedly debunked the October Surprise investigation is now recognized as something of a Likud propagandist , and the CD lead investigators for the task force allowed neoconservative friends to influence the course of the inquiry . However , RB as Likud operatives and allies worked to derail any serious investigation , CD top Likud official was more forthcoming . In 1993 , I took part in an interview with JJ Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in Tel Aviv during which he VBD he had read Gary Sick ’s 1991 book , October Surprise , which made the NN for believing that the Republicans had intervened in the 1980 hostage negotiations to disrupt Carter ’s reelection . With the topic raised , CD interviewer asked , “ What do you VB ? Was there an October Surprise ? ” “ Of course , it was , ” Shamir responded without hesitation . “ It was . ” Later in the interview , Shamir , who succeeded Begin as prime minister in the 1980s , seemed to regret his frankness and tried to backpedal on his answer , but his confirmation remained a startling moment . The current knock on the October Surprise story is that it ’s now ancient history and that it ’s wrong to dig up unpleasant facts about the late NNP Ronald Reagan , who has become something of an icon on the NNP and someone that MSNBC ’s Chris Matthews recently deemed “ CD of the all - NN greats ” among presidents . Further , Jimmy Carter is held in disdain by JJ Washington insiders , considered a “ failed NN . ” In other words , the prevailing view is that things worked out just fine in replacing Carter with Reagan no matter how it was done and it makes no sense to rehash any of this unpleasantness . However , there is another NN to read the history : If Carter had freed the hostages and won a second term , the NNP NNPS might have continued on a path toward alternative NN , the federal deficit MD not have soared , and deregulation of corporations MD not have opened the environment and the JJ sector to such dangers . Further , the NNP NNPS might not have embarked on a massive JJ buildup or engaged in the aggressive intelligence operations that went with it . And , Israel might have been pushed into an equitable peace with its Palestinian neighbors three decades RB , rather than pursuing a settlement policy that now makes such an agreement close to impossible . Possibly RB more important , if the sabotaging of Carter ’s reelection in 1980 had failed or at least if it had been exposed in the 1990s , the NNP NNPS might now enjoy a much healthier democracy — VBN on hard truths , not comforting illusions .

You do what the f*ck I tell y’all to do . Or we VBP rid of y’all . ’ ” James ’s comments come after a stormy few seasons in the NFL . CD NNS , Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid , have filed grievances against the NN and its teams ’ owners alleging they colluded to keep them out of NN due to their stance on JJ issues . Both NNS knelt during the national anthem to highlight racial injustice in the NNP NNPS . Although Reid has now VBN a NN , the Carolina Panthers , this week he VBD he had been randomly NN tested by the NN six times in 11 weeks . Yahoo Sports calculated the chances of that happening were 0.17 % . The NBA , on the other hand , has been praised for being much more progressive on JJ issues . “ The difference between the NBA and the NFL , the NBA is what we VBP he [ a player ] can be .

Egypt will host the 32nd African Cup of Nations , but that was n't how it was intended to be . Cameroon were named as the host nation back in 2014 . However , failure to provide adequate infrastructure at NN venues , combined with the conflict between French - and English - speakers in the NN , prompted Africa 's CAF NN federation to withdraw Cameroon 's hosting rights in January . The games will take place in four venues split between six stadiums . The capital Cairo boasts three stadiums : the Cairo International Stadium , the NNP Salam Stadium and the June 30 Stadium ( a controversial name referring to the fall of JJ NNP Mohamed Morsi in 2013 ) . The other host cities are Suez , Alexandria and Ismailia . The final will take place in Cairo on CD June at the Cairo International Stadium . Who are the favorites ? It goes without saying that hosts Egypt , boasting Mo Salah in their side , and reigning champions Cameroon belong among the front - runners . But , as usual at this competition , narrowing the field of potential contenders is not easy . Senegal , Morocco , Nigeria and Ghana are just some of the teams with at least a chance of claiming the title . Tanzania 's coach Emmanuel Amunike hit the nail on the head when he warned to write nobody off : "" All the teams that are here are good , "" the 48 - NN - JJ JJ Sporting and Barcelona striker VBD . The tournament RB includes three NNS that have never made the cut : Burundi , Mauritania and Madagascar . Who are the stars ? With the games being played in Egypt , it 's difficult to look far past Mohammed Salah . Liverpool 's forward MD an international title to his Champions NNP triumph . It MD be Salah 's JJ African Cup of Nations trophy ; Egypt MD lead Africa with seven titles , but they have n't won since 2007 . Liverpool are well represented throughout . Sadio Mane is surely Senegal 's standout star , while Naby Keita will look to drive Guinea 's midfield . The contingent of leading Premier NNP stars is rounded out with Morocco and NNP City winger Riyadh Mahrez . Fans and scouts alike will have their eyes on versatile Ajax attacker Hakim Ziyech , another member of Morocco 's deep squad . Ziyech has been told he 's free to leave , and reportedly dreams of a move to Barcelona or NNP . Several Bundesliga clubs are VBN to have put out feelers regarding the 26 - NN - JJ , the same goes for Inter Milan and AS Roma . Fifteen Bundesliga NNS have made it to the tournament , including Guinea 's Ibrahima Traore ( Borussia Mönchengladbach ) , Senegal 's Salif Sane ( Schalke ) and the Ivory Coast 's Amadou Haidara ( RB Leipzig ) . What else is JJ ? For the JJ NN , the competition is being played in the northern hemisphere 's summer . In the past it took place in January and February , meaning that the star NNS at JJ clubs MD miss an important phase of the domestic NN . This scheduling fits the JJ teams better , but the higher temperatures MD prove an extra burden on NNS already fatigued by a JJ NN . And , as in so JJ international competitions of late , expansion 's the name of the NN . For the JJ NN , 24 teams rather than 16 will take part — following in the footsteps of Euro 2018 and the NNP 's NNP Cup . The upshot 's the same at the other competitions : very few teams will drop out in the group phase . Instead of CD progressing from each group , now the top CD from each of the six groups plus the four best - performing third - placed finishers will advance to the JJ knockout round of 16 ."

That is , have you ever turned on your faucet and VBN that no NN came out of it ? If you VBP your NN from a municipal NN NN , the answer is probably "" no . "" We have NN failures all the NN . Cable TV goes out fairly frequently . Although less common , the phone NN goes down every so often , and it is now common to VB an "" all circuits busy "" message when making JJ - distance calls . But the NN in any city or suburb is always there . NN pressure is very reliable . A JJ reason for that level of reliability is the NN tower . You VBP NN towers everywhere , especially if you live in a JJ area full of small towns . Each NN NN has CD or more towers . In this article , we will look at how NN towers work . The next NN you drive by a NN tower , you will VB exactly what it is doing . A NN tower is an incredibly simple device . Although NN towers come in all shapes and sizes , they all do the same thing : A NN tower is simply a JJ , elevated tank of NN . For example , take the NN tower shown at the NN . This tower is located in Kill Devils Hill , near Kitty Hawk , NC . It is about 165 NNS ( 50 meters ) tall . NN towers are tall to provide pressure . Each NN of height provides 0.43 PSI ( pounds IN square Inch ) of pressure . A typical municipal NN supply runs at between 50 and 100 PSI ( major appliances require at least 20 to 30 PSI ) . The NN tower must be tall enough to supply that level of pressure to all of the houses and businesses in the area of the tower . So NN towers are typically located on high ground , and they are tall enough to provide the necessary pressure . In hilly regions , a tower can sometimes be replaced by a simple tank located on the highest hill in the area . A NN tower 's tank is normally quite JJ . A normal in - ground swimming pool in someone 's backyard might hold something IN 20,000 or 30,000 gallons ( that 's a lot of NN ! ) , and a typical NN tower might hold 50 times that amount ! Typically , a NN tower 's tank is sized to hold about a day 's worth of NN for the community served by the tower . If the pumps fail ( for example , during a NN failure ) , the NN tower holds enough NN to keep things flowing for about a day . CD of the JJ advantages of a NN tower is that it lets a municipality size its pumps for average rather than peak demand . That can save a community a lot of NN . VB that the NN consumption for a pumping station averages 500 gallons of NN IN minute ( or 720,000 gallons over the course of a day ) . There will be times during the day when NN consumption is much greater than 500 gallons IN minute . For example , in the morning , lots of NNS wake up at about the same NN ( VB 7:00 a.m. ) to VB to work . They VBP to the bathroom , take a shower , brush their teeth , etc . NN demand might peak at 2,000 gallons IN minute at 7 a.m. -- there is a JJ cost difference between a 500 - gallon - per- minute pump and a 2,000 - gallon - IN - minute pump . Because of the NN tower , the municipality can purchase a 500 - gallon - IN - minute pump and let the NN tower handle the peak demand . At night , when demand normally falls to practically zero , the pump can VB up the difference and refill the NN tower . In most towns , the NN NNS drink comes from either a well , a river or a reservoir ( normally a local lake ) . The NN is treated in a NN NN plant to remove sediment ( by filtration and / or settling ) and bacteria ( typically with ozone , ultraviolet light and chlorine ) . The output from the NN NN plant is clear , germ - free NN . A high - lift pump pressurizes the NN and sends it to the NN NN 's primary feeder pipes . The NN tower is attached to the primary feeders quite simply , as shown in this diagram : If the pump is producing more NN than the NN NN needs , the excess flows automatically into the tank . If the community is demanding more NN than the pump can supply , then NN flows out of the tank to meet the need . NN towers come in all shapes and sizes . Take , for example , this JJ peach along I - 85 in Gaffney , NNP Carolina . In a city , tall buildings often need to solve their own NN pressure problems . Because the buildings are so tall , they often exceed the height that the city 's NN pressure can handle . So a tall building will have its own pumps and its own NN towers . In the following picture , taken from the Empire NNP Building in NNP York City , there are at least 30 small NN towers visible on the tops of these buildings . Another interesting fact about NN towers -- they can affect your insurance rates ! During a fire , the NN demand increases significantly and MD greatly exceed the capacity of the pumps at the NN plant . A NN tower guarantees that there will be enough pressure to keep NN flowing through the fire hydrants . Fire insurance rates are normally lower in a community in which the NN NN has NN towers . The next NN you are out driving RB , especially if you are driving through a series of small towns , take the NN to notice the NN towers . Now that you VBP how they work , you will be amazed by how JJ you VBP and by all the different forms they take ! For more i­nformation on NN towers and related topics , check out the links below ."

Officials have ordered 50 CD units of NN , since each NN must be innoculated twice . Berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 CD euros ( $ 850 CD ) , although NN insurance NNS argue that CD CD euros is more realistic . Where to send the bill ? CD JJ unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ? Berlin has VBN the NN insurance NNS must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients . The Federal Association of Local Authorities ( DSTGB ) insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations . Consumer and employer associations have RB warned against attempting to pass on immunization costs . "" It 's poison for employment , especially during this JJ NN , "" VBD the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( DIHK ) in a statement . The benefits of such a massive program have not been adequately substantiated , according to Professor Gerd Glaeske , who researches pharmaceutical applications at the Center for NNP Politics at the NNP of Bremen . “ Vaccinations are not a panacea , ” Glaeske VBD . Some critics RB suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine NN epidemic has been artificially created . They point to the very limited number of swine NN infections in Germany , none of which have been fatal . “ This is huge business for the pharmaceutical industry , ” VBD NNP Democrat deputy , Wolfgang Wodarg . "" The swine NN outbreak is no different from a normal NN outbreak "" , he told the Neue Presse newspaper in Hanover . “ Quite the opposite , if you compare the number of swine NN NNS with other NN outbreaks . It 's ridiculous , ” he added . The NN plan , so far The German NNP Ministry late last month announced a draft plan outlining who will be immunized RB . Those suffering from asthma , bronchitis , diabetes , certain immune deficiencies including HIV infections , or heart , liver and kidney ailments top the list , as well as pregnant NNS and the obese . Healthcare workers and JJ employees are RB high on the list . Meanwhile , it has been determined that a so - called PCR test , which MD confirm if someone has swine NN , is too unreliable to be VBN except in extreme NNS . The test failed to detect the presence of swine NN in half of all NNS . Berlin plans to immunize millions of citizens in a very short NN to beat the start of the NN NN . The DSTGB fears being overwhelmed with the task . It VBZ the NN 's draft NN plan has not been carefully thought through and warns of confusion due to a poor allocation of responsibilities . It has called for local NN authorities , doctors and clinics to be urgently informed of the NN 's specific plans . A spokeswoman for the German NNP Ministry VBD NN agreements will be finalized with Germany 's 16 federal NNS over the next few weeks . Germany 's largest NN insurer , AOK , has already suggested setting up four “ NN Sundays ” in order to carry out the massive task of immunizing 680,000 NNS in the northern NN of Schleswig - Holstein within a very short NN of NN . Meanwhile , pharmaceutical NNS , including Sanofi Pasteur , Novartis and CSL are producing the NN at top speed . But , although vaccinations are set to begin in the fall , final JJ tests MD take more than a NN . Prodution of the swine NN NN will not be able to meet worldwide demand . To VB the most efficient NN of the doses available , the NNP NNP Organisation ( WHO ) VBD in a press conference in Geneva on Thursday , that NNS in the northern hemisphere should be the JJ to VB the NN in September or October , when the NN NN starts there . The WHO added that doctors and nurses in the southern hemisphere should RB be among the JJ NNS to receive swine NN shots ."

We RB outline the potential NN options associated with each NN . NN professionals have identified several causes of swollen NNS . Examples include injuries , infections , and various forms of arthritis . Each NN has its own management and NN options . There are 26 bones in the JJ NN , and 14 of these are in the NNS . NNS play a critical role in balance and movement . Having a swollen NN can affect a NN ’s ability to balance and walk . Causes and their NNS The sections that follow discuss some specific causes of NN swelling , and the other NNS a NN might experience . Some common injuries that can VB a swollen NN include : • dropping something heavy on the NN Aside from swelling , NNS who injure their NN MD RB experience : Some injuries involve a break in CD or more bones within the NN . If the NN is broken , bruising MD appear the day after the injury . A stress fracture is a tiny hairline break in a bone . These tend to occur with repetitive activities such as running . The NNS of a stress fracture are similar to those of a bone break , but they are RB less severe . NN typically occurs during activity and stops during rest . The NN MD swell but does not RB bruise . Arthritis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the joints . It results in NN and tissue damage . It affects over CD - third of NNS living in the NNP NNPS . There are JJ different types of arthritis . CD common types are osteoarthritis ( OA ) and rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . OA occurs due to general wear and tear of the joints . RA is an autoimmune condition in which the NN ’s own immune NN attacks the joints and other tissues . Both types of arthritis MD affect the joints within the NNS . Arthritis in the NNS MD result in NN , stiffness , and deformities in the joints . These deformities MD appear as swellings . Psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) is a type of arthritis that affects some NNS with psoriasis . Psoriasis is an autoimmune condition that causes red plaques to develop on the NN . These are particularly common on the scalp and back , as well as IN the joints . Worldwide , about 125 CD NNS have psoriasis , or RB 2 – 3 % of the NN ’s population . NNS estimate that up to 30 % of NNS with psoriasis RB develop PsA . NNS with PsA MD have swollen NNS and fingers that appear sausage - shaped . This is called dactylitis . PsA can RB affect the hips , knees , and spine . Gout is another type of arthritis . This type causes crystals to form within and IN the joints , resulting in inflammation and NN . Gout most commonly occurs in the JJ metatarsophalangeal joint at the base of the JJ NN , but it can RB occur in other joints , including the ankle and knee . NNS with gout MD experience intense joint NN that appears suddenly . NNS typically reach their maximum intensity within 24 hours of a flare - up . The swollen NN MD appear red and feel warm to the touch . Hallux rigidus is another type of arthritis that affects the metatarsophalangeal joint at the base of the JJ NN . Inflammation in this joint can VB NN and stiffness in the NN , which MD RB VB difficulty walking . Hallux rigidus can RB VB a bump to develop on the top of the NN . This bump MD appear similar to a bunion or a callus . • stiffness in the JJ NN , characterized by an inability to bend it up or down • NN in the joint during activity , especially when pushing off on the NNS while walking An ingrown toenail is a nail that has grown into its surrounding NN , causing inflammation and infection . The inflamed area MD appear as a bump . Left untreated , an ingrown toenail can VB severe NN and discomfort . Some MD require surgery . NN infections and soft tissue infections that affect the NN can VB the NNS to swell . There are JJ potential causes of such infections . Examples include : A bunion is a bump that develops on the joint at the base of the JJ NN . This occurs as a result of changes to the bones within the NN . These changes VBP the JJ NN to lean in toward the second NN , instead of pointing straight ahead . With NN , the bones gradually drift further out of alignment , causing the bunion to grow . Bunions can VB the following NNS : • NN or soreness at the NN of the bump"

I ’ve been investigating and writing about JJ epidemics for over 30 NNS . CD of my prime strategies : were there hidden and unreported causes that MD explain NNS ’s NNS and illnesses — causes having nothing to do with viruses ? I VBD them . “ The NN ” turned out to be a convenient and very effective cover story that MD obscure the true causes that important forces wanted to hide . So I began looking into Wuhan , the center of the current “ NN epidemic . ” I was particularly interested in the CD symptom that was slightly different from the typical NN NNS from past JJ epidemics : the emphasis on lung problems and pneumonia . Here is what I ’ve VBN out so far . RB of all , Wuhan , a city of 11 CD , is called “ the Chicago of China . ” It is both an JJ juggernaut and a transportation hub — railroads , roads , highways connecting travelers to other Chinese cities . Several sources list the annual GDP of Wuhan at a staggering $ 220 CD dollars . 230 foreign Fortune 500 NNS have offices in Wuhan and do business there . All in all , 80 foreign NNS are funding NNS in the city . The Chinese NNP NNP is now underway . It lasts from January 25 to February 10 . During this period , Chinse NNS travel . They journey far and wide . In fact , this is the largest annual JJ migration on the NN . We ’re talking about hundreds of millions of NNS on the move . So it ’s a devastating coincidence (? ) that now there MD be an epidemic and a massive lockdown of Chinese cities and transportation . Along with stopping NNS from moving RB , enormous amounts of NN are being lost because tourist consumers ca n’t VB on the road and spend NN . This might be called a clue . It MD require much investigation . Is someone intentionally torpedoing the Chinese NN ? Then there is this , from Bloomberg NNP , “ China Wants Activists to Stay Out of Its NN on Pollution . Citizen activism in the mold of Greta Thunberg is all but taboo in the NN ’s biggest polluter , ” January 23 , 2020 : “ When Premier Li Keqiang declared a ‘ NN against pollution ’ in 2014 , a few hundred residents of the city of Wuhan in central China took it as a cue . ” “ They printed Li ’s words on a six - meter ( 20 NN ) banner and protested outside a foul - smelling incinerator plant they feared was causing illness in the community . Buoyed by the conviction they were answering the leadership ’s call , the residents were instead harassed by local police officers who tore down the sign and trampled on it . ” “ ’We were worried and angry when we realized what was causing the stench and making our kids sick ’ , VBD Zhang Xijiao , 44 , who was detained for a week for making the banner . ‘ But we are IN ants , the local NN can crush us as they please ’ . ” “ Ren Rui , 40 , quit her apartment in CD after her son developed a lung condition that required repeat surgery . She VBD smoke from the plant MD blow her NN under certain conditions . She tried to rent it out , ‘ but no NN wants to move here . Sometimes my mood depended on the direction of the wind , ’ VBD Ren . Despite the JJ pressure since , ‘ I never regretted moving away ’ . ” Let ’s move on to another description of Chinese protests — in Wuhan . CNN , July 11 , 2019 , “ China has made major progress on NN pollution . Wuhan protests show there ’s still a JJ NN to VB ” : “ … Recent weeks [ in Wuhan ] have seen major protests there — in themselves a rarity in China — over plans for a JJ garbage incineration plant . ” “ Holding banners with slogans such as ‘ we do n’t VB to be poisoned , we just need a breath of fresh NN , ’ thousands [!] of NNS took to the city ’s streets over CD weeks in June and July calling for the suspension of plans to build the plant . ” “ ’We are fearful that the plant is too close to residence area , ’ CD protester in the city of 10 CD NNS told NN NN . Others expressed concern that NNS MD worsen NN pollution and harm residents ’ NN . ” “ Local officials were apparently surprised by the scale and size of the protests , which came after several similar waste plants were reportedly VBN to be giving off dangerous NNS . Photos and videos shared on JJ NN showed JJ crowds marching in the streets near where the plant was to be built , and police arresting numerous protesters . ” “ The NN has since suspended building of the plant , which locals VBD had halted protests , but a heavy police presence remains in the city where the situation is tense . ” “ JJ pressure has been the driving force of pollution policy in China , and it shows no sign of letting up . ” “ In CD , protesters took to the streets of Chengdu wearing face masks to demand action to tackle smog , while other demonstrations have targeted NN and chemical plants in Sichuan , Jiangsu and Heilongjiang provinces in recent NNS . ” “ The Chinese NN is highly sensitive to the threat of protests IN those in Wuhan , with the shadow of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre looming JJ . Calls for collective action are among the most censored subjects RB , and NNS organizing protests or working for civil society groups can face harassment and imprisonment . ” In other words , protests against pollution in CD Chinese city can inspire protests in other cities . A very dangerous situation for the Chinese NN . Furthermore , it is generally acknowledged that official and corporate reports on pollution levels are being faked , to VB “ dangerous ” into “ healthy . ” Grist.org , June 12 , 2012 , “ China ’s smog city : What Wuhan looks IN with 20 times the U.S. dust limit ” : “ At about 2 a .m. local NN Monday morning , a dense smog began to cover the province . By early afternoon , it reached its peak density in the NN - locked city of Wuhan itself … The demonstrable danger is to lungs and bloodstreams . ” “ The foul NN of dozens of fast - expanding cities across China contains cocktails of toxic contaminants unprecedented in the range of pollutants they contain at high concentrations . Now , JJ research into these swirling maelstroms of gases and tiny particulates suggests that they MD be incubating chemical reactions that compound the NN effects in ways not seen before – effects that doctors VBP are cutting five NNS off the expected lifespan of half a CD NNS in northern China … China has the NN ’s most dangerous outdoor NN pollution . ” “ Three other cities listed as regularly suffering dangerous levels of four or five of the pollutants are Jining , RB in Shandong , Wuhan in Hubei province , and Jiayuguan and Jinchang in Gansu . None of the seven appear in the lists of the ten most polluted Chinese cities published by the WHO or Chinese environment ministry . ” “ All the five major pollutants in smogs – SO2 , NOx , ozone , PM10 and PM2.5 — are VBN to be linked individually to increased NN of strokes , heart NN , lung cancer and asthma , and to rising hospital admissions and death rates during smogs . What is disturbing is that there is growing evidence of synergistic effects between these different pollutants that VBP the whole worse than the sum of the parts . ” Lung NN — and no need to invoke a NN to explain it . We have CD major clues here . CD , the distinct possibility of an JJ warfare attack against Wuhan and , during the Chinese NNP NNP , against all of China . And CD , the NN of a NN cover story to obscure huge pollution dangers and put down protests against that pollution , through mass lockdowns and quarantines . Too JJ times to count them . Wherever in the NN you MD VB extraordinary chemical pollution , grinding poverty , NN , starvation , lethal dehydration , absence of basic sanitation , overcrowding in cities , horrendously contaminated NN supplies , corporate takeover of farm NN from the NNS , the highly destructive NN of NNS and toxic JJ drugs and pesticides — you VBP a conscious and sustained effort to VB the weakened population — and you will find the NN cover story publicized to the sky as the explanation for suffering , illness , and death .

Buoyed by an enormous 48 percent increase in Microsoft ’s share price this NN , NNP has retaken the title he last held in CD . That outcome is partially owed to the whims of Donald J. NNP . Microsoft recently surprisingly defeated Amazon ’s bid for an extremely lucrative $ 10 CD Pentagon cloud computing contract that sees the NN instantly become CD of the NN ’s most important JJ and security contractors . This decision , Amazon alleges , was due to interference from the NN who holds a personal grudge against Bezos , whose Washington Post has maintained a NN of “ resistance ” against him . NNPS was RB recently in the NN attacking the wealth NN that Democratic presidential nomination candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have proposed . “ I ’m all for super - progressive NN systems but when you VBP I should pay $ 100 CD , then I ’m starting to do a little math about what I have left over , ” the Seattle native VBD . ( For the record , he MD still have over $ 6 CD ) . In response , Warren was apologetic , asking for an opportunity to meet with NNP to explain how much he MD pay under the plan . “ I promise it ’s not $ 100 CD , ” she VBD . But Sanders has been far more forthright in his opposition to the super - wealthy , categorically stating , “ billionaires should not exist . ” Across the NN , NNPS is presented as CD of the “ good billionaires ” : a warm - hearted philanthropist dedicated to giving away his entire fortune to needy causes . His charitable organization , the Bill and Melinda NNP Foundation , is the largest of its sort in the NN , holding over $ 50 CD in assets . His insight and generosity are constantly emphasized in headlines , as the following examples demonstrate . “ How Bill NNPS aims to Clean Up the NNP , ” The Guardian , ( 2/4/18 ) . “ What Einstein and Bill NNPS Teach Us About NNP Travel , ” NBC NNP , ( 5/10/17 ) . “ Bill NNPS And Other Billionaires Pledge To Take On NN NN , ” NPR , ( 11/30/15 ) . “ Bill NNP on ending NN , saving lives : ‘ NN is on our side , ’ ” NNP - Jazeera , ( 4/27/19 ) . “ Bill NNP gives $ 4.6 bn to charity in biggest donation since 2000 , ” The Guardian , ( 8/15/17 ) . There are a few problems with that narrative . Firstly , if NNPS is so committed to giving his NN away , why does he keep getting richer ? This is not a trivial question : his net worth has increased from $ 75 CD in March CD to a staggering $ 106 CD today , according to Forbes Magazine , an over 40 percent increase in three NNS alone . Lee Camp , a political comedian who covers topics IN rampant inequality on his show , Redacted Tonight , told MintPress NNP : Linsey McGoey , Professor of Sociology at the NNP of Essex , UK , and author of No Such Thing as a Free Gift : The NNP Foundation and the Price of Philanthropy , is profoundly skeptical of philanthropy as a whole , claiming it can actually sometimes harm democracy in the JJ run : “ Philanthropy can and is being VBN deliberately to divert attention away from different forms of JJ exploitation that underpin JJ inequality today ” she told MintPress NNP , Thus , huge donations give NNPS enormous NN over the education , NN and JJ policies of entire NNS . Where do Bill ’s billions VB ? As Foreign Affairs noted , “ few policy initiatives or normative standards set by the NNP NNP Organization are announced before they have been casually , unofficially vetted by NNP Foundation staff . ” In this sense , his wealth is extraordinarily anti-democratic , giving him veto NN over the decisions and directions of organizations that should be collectively made by the highest representatives of the NN ’s population , not by CD very rich NN . And NNPS is far from omnipotent , holding JJ of the patronizing assumptions about developing NNS and how best to organize the NN that PRP MD expect a rich JJ tech geek to hold . McGoey spells out the problem with this corporate attitude to NN : CD example of the Foundation enhancing corporate NN is its close relationship with highly controversial pharmaceutical and chemical NN Monsanto Corporation , whom it helped gain a stronger foothold in Africa . It RB oversaw a flawed JJ NN of the HPV NN in India in 2009 , where 23,000 impoverished girls aged 9 - 15 were exposed to potentially lethal drugs without RB their NNS ’ consent , leading to seven deaths . He is RB preoccupied with controlling Africa ’s population through family planning , fearing a population boom . As such , he appears almost more interested in eliminating the NNS who are suffering than the source of the suffering itself . NNPS is RB CD of the most important individuals leading the assault on the JJ JJ education network in the form of charter schools . Charter schools effectively privatize the JJ school NN , where the NN continues to VB the bill for the school , but has no influence or VB in how it is run . They have not been VBN to increase test scores , but are very popular with both the private sector and the religious NN , whereas the vast majority of unionized JJ school teachers oppose them . But , as the Associated Press stated , there is “ no bigger champion [ of charter schools ] than Bill NNP , ” who has plowed enormous amounts of NN into the movement , RB funding the pro-charter school documentary Waiting For Superman . If NNPS represents a net negative force in NN politics , why does he receive such good press ? CD reason MD be his sizeable donations to a host of mainstream corporate NN outlets . For example , the NNP Foundation underwrites the entire NNP NN section of the Guardian , and has given the British newspaper over $ 9 CD . Studying its donation database , it transpires it has RB contributed over $ 3 CD to NBC Universal , over $ 4 CD to the influential French newspaper , Le Monde , over $ 4.5 CD to NPR , $ 1 CD to NNP - Jazeera , and an astonishing $ 49 CD to the BBC ’s NN Action program , to name only a few . He who pays the piper , it is VBN , calls the tune . McGoey claims that the motive of billionaires giving to NN organizations is primarily “ to VB legitimate the spurious idea that JJ corporate actors can rectify the JJ harms and JJ inequality that their practices have often compounded . ” NNPS himself is the head of a gigantic NN empire . We already rely on Microsoft for JJ NN ( LinkedIn ) , entertainment ( Xbox ) , hardware and software IN the Windows Phone and Windows OS . The NN RB owns stakes in NN giants IN Comcast and AT&T . And the “ MS ” in “ MSNBC ” stands for “ Microsoft . ” It is a similar story for Jeff Bezos , who , in addition to Amazon ’s myriad NN ventures , owns the Washington Post , which NN watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting has constantly shown often descends into little more than a propaganda outlet for its boss ’s interests . It appears that once billionaires have purchased every worldly material good possible , the only things left to buy are NN and influence . While the NN MD be full of stories singing NNPS ’ praises , presenting him as a good billionaire ( as opposed to the current NN ) , the reality is that CD NN with that amount of NN , be it political ( IN NNP ) or JJ ( IN NNPS and Bezos ) has a highly corrosive effect on democracy and society more generally . While they are portrayed as visionaries , multi-billionaires are often blinkered in other , very important ways . Just as reports about Amazon workers ’ poor pay and shocking working conditions were surfacing , Bezos declared that the only NN he MD VB to spend the JJ resources he accrued was to explore the solar NN and beyond . Sharing the profit with his beleaguered workforce appears to genuinely not have occurred to him . If we are to move towards a better society , the philanthropy of the super - wealthy must be scrutinized , as all too often , what appears to be a generous gift is actually a calculated action intended to increase their NN , image or influence . As JJ British Prime Minister Clement Attlee VBD , “ Charity is a cold grey loveless thing . If a rich NN wants to VB the poor , he should pay his taxes gladly , not dole out NN at a whim . ” Bill NNP is not just some rich guy who is unsure about paying more NN : he ’s a menace to society . *( Top image : William ( Bill ) H.

If no definitive proof is VBN , the group that presented the “ most compelling evidence and NN ” will be awarded a $ 100,000 research grant to keep searching .

After offering to VB take him home , Norgren struck Mr McDonald on the head with a rock , causing him to black out .

As the struggle unfolded he asked his attacker why he was trying to kill him to which Norgren replied : ' NNP kills the hunter ' . Mr McDonald VBD he managed to bite CD of Mr Norgren 's knuckles before the attacker appeared to ' pass out ' on top of him .

The JJ of a raft of papers about ‘ Little NNP ’ suggests that the fossil is a female who showed some of the earliest signs of JJ - JJ bipedal walking IN 3.67 CD NNS RB . She MD RB belong to a distinct NN that most NNS have n’t previously recognized . “ It ’s almost a miracle it ’s come out intact , ” VBZ Robin Crompton , a musculoskeletal biologist at the NNP of Liverpool , UK , who has collaborated with the research NN that excavated the skeleton . As well echoing the mythical ‘ NNP ’ , the nickname Little NNP comes from the small size of the NN bones that were among the JJ parts of the skeleton to be discovered . The JJ signs that there was an invaluable hominin specimen up for grabs came in 1994 . Ronald Clarke , a palaeoanthropologist at the NNP of the Witwatersrand ( Wits NNP ) in Johannesburg , NNP Africa , was rifling through boxes of fossils at a field laboratory at the Sterkfontein caves , about 40 kilometres northwest of Johannesburg . He realized that a handful of small bones in the collection belonged to an early hominin . He established that the bones were those of a NN of Australopithecus — ape - IN hominins that were present in Africa between about 4 CD and 2 CD NNS RB , before the JJ genus Homo rose to dominance1 . Clarke and his colleagues then VBD JJ more bones embedded in a matrix of solid rock deep in the Sterkfontein caves . They began carefully excavating Little NNP , piece by fragile piece , using hammers and chisels , followed by precision tools . The entire process took them almost 20 NNS . “ The fossilized bone is actually softer than the matrix , ’ VBZ Crompton . “ It ’s been an absolute devil to VB it out . ” By late last NN , Clarke ’s NN had successfully removed enough bones to reconstruct more than 90 % of the skeleton , and the specimen was unveiled to the NN . No other Australopithecus fossil comes close to that level of completeness . For comparison , the most famous Australopithecus — Lucy — is RB 40 % complete . On 29 November , Clarke ’s NN , posted CD papers on Little NNP to the bioRxiv preprint server — CD on the age of the specimen2 , the other on the limbs and locomotion3 . On 4 December , the NNS posted a third , on the skull and on the potential relationship to a VBN hominin species4 . The NN posted a fourth paper5 , this NN focusing on the arms and an injury Little NNP received during her NN , on 5 December . Further papers , on the hand , teeth and inner ear , are expected in the near future , VBZ Crompton . Most will ultimately appear in a special edition of the Journal of NNP Evolution . The bioRxiv papers crystallize ideas that emerged in earlier publications about the age of the fossil . They RB cover some JJ ground , suggesting that Little NNP was an adult female and stood about 130 centimetres tall — just 10 centimetres shorter than the average woman in some modern - JJ populations . “ Little NNP was quite JJ , ” VBZ Crompton . The paper covering limbs and locomotion3 reveals that Little NNP ’s legs are longer than her arms , similar to modern NNS , making her the oldest hominin for which we can be sure of that feature , VBZ Crompton . This means that Little NNP was better adapted to walking upright on the ground than JJ other australopiths , at least some of which seem to have spent more NN moving through trees . Little NNP ’s skull bones and teeth are so unusual that Clarke and his colleagues have categorized her as a distinct species4 . They chose not to give this NN a JJ name , but instead designate it as Australopithecus prometheus . A. prometheus was suggested in 1948 on the basis of a skull fragment VBN roughly 250 kilometres RB of Johannesburg6 , but quickly fell out of fashion when NNS decided it was simply an unusual representative of an already recognized NN , called A. africanus . Clarke does n’t VB that Little NNP belongs to A. africanus , and VBZ the simplest option is to resurrect the name A. prometheus for Little NNP and a handful of similar fossils . The preprint RB suggests that A. prometheus is potentially an ancestor of a group of hominins called Paranthropus4 , which co-existed with early Homo NN for about a CD NNS . Lee Berger , an archaeologist RB at Wits NNP who was not involved in the excavations , but is working on publications about Little NNP , disagrees with the decision to resurrect A. prometheus . In a paper that is scheduled to be published on 10 December in the NNP Journal of Physical Anthropology , Berger argues that the name A. prometheus was never properly defined . He has n’t yet decided whether Little NNP constitutes a distinct NN — but if she does , Berger thinks a JJ name is needed . Berger adds he is disappointed by the lack of solid information in the papers on the age and locomotion findings — he MD have liked to have seen detailed measurements of the fossil bones , for instance . “ There ’s no NNS — there are almost no measurements of the fossils , ” he VBZ . Berger hopes to provide those NNS in his own publications — although he is still at an early stage of his analysis . Crompton responds that the locomotion paper is essentially an overview that attempts to reconstruct how Little NNP moved by drawing on the solid NNS given in the other papers . More - detailed NNS can be VBN in the NN ’s other papers , he VBZ . Gabriele Macho , a biological anthropologist at the NNP of Oxford , UK , agrees that the locomotion paper is light on solid NNS , but notes that the NN acknowledges that it is a work in progress . She looks forward to VB more - detailed papers in the future . “ The positive thing is this skeleton is tremendously important , ” she VBZ . “ No question about it . ”"

IN JJ true stories filtered through Hollywood ’s often overly sentimental lens , The Sound of Music on - screen differs significantly from the true tale of Maria , the novice nun who takes a job as a governess in the Austrian household of the von Trapps , only to find herself falling in love with widower and retired naval captain Georg von Trapp and his seven NNS . The NN stars Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer as Maria and Georg , and features enduring songs such as “ Do - Re - Mi , ” “ How Do You Solve a Problem IN Maria , ” “ Climb Ev’ry Mountain ” and “ Edelweiss . ” It received five Academy Awards ( including best picture ) and is the third highest - grossing movie of all NN in the U.S. after its box office is adjusted for inflation .

She attended teachers ' college where she discovered religion and converted to Catholicism before becoming a candidate for the novitiate in Salzburg . Portrayed on NN by Andrews as demure and self - effacing , the real Maria was in fact a real problem while at the convent , describing herself as “ horrid , the worst you can imagine , ” in a 1980 article which includes a list of transgressions such as breaking china , speaking during periods of silence , running in the courtyard , whistling Gregorian chants and climbing on the convent roof . The names of the von Trapp NNS – and amount – were changed in the movie In 1926 Maria was sent from the convent to tutor only CD of Captain von Trapp ’s seven NNS from his JJ marriage . Georg ’s second eldest daughter , Maria , had contracted scarlet fever – the same NN that took his JJ wife ’s NN four NNS prior – and MD no longer travel the distance to and from school . Most readers by now have questioned the name of Georg ’s daughter listed above . It ’s no surprise the name is not familiar as CD of the NNS ’s , in fact , all the names and sexes of the seven von Trapp NNS represented in the movie were changed . The real von Trapp NNS were ( in age descending order ) Rupert , Agathe , Maria , Werner , Hedwig , Johanna and Martina . On screen Rupert became Liesl , a 16 VBG on 17 - NN - JJ girl . In real NN , by the NN the family fled Austria , Rupert was in his late twenties and a practicing physician . RB the number of NNS was not correct in the movie . When the von Trapps escaped Austria there were in fact nine NNS : seven from Georg ’s JJ marriage and CD from his marriage to Maria , Rosmarie and Eleonore . The tenth child , Johannes , was born in NNP in 1939 . The real family was n't as wealthy as portrayed on screen Though NN did not appear to be of concern to the family depicted in the movie , in real NN the fortunes of the von Trapp family had faltered during the JJ depression of the early 1930s to the extent that at the NN the NN is set , most of the household servants had been dismissed and the family had begun taking in boarders . The lack of funds RB prompted the family to consider turning their love of singing together into a profession . “ It almost hurt [ my father ] to have his family on stage , not from a snobbish view , but more from a protective NN , ” Eleonore is quoted as saying in a 1978 Washington Post interview . The von Trapps were a musical household well before Maria entered their lives Both in real and reel NN , the family singers won JJ place in the Salzburg Music Festival . But the sound of music was already well established within the household before Maria arrived . In a reversal of the stern , music - forbidding retired naval officer depicted in the NN , the real Georg and his JJ wife encouraged song in the family home NNS before Maria arrived . “ In reality , Georg was a warm and loving if somewhat overwhelmed father , ” author Tom Santopietro writes in The Sound of Music Story . “ It was actually Maria herself , with her emotionally stunted upbringing , who needed thawing . ” IN the NN , Maria and Georg were in fact married only a NN after the novice arrived as governess . Unlike the NN , they were actually married in 1927 , more than a decade before fleeing Austria in 1938 . Georg was 25 NNS older than Maria and the NN was not love at JJ sight . Though Georg had fallen for Maria and asked her to stay with him and become a second mother to his NNS , Maria was not as sure of the union , reportedly saying , “ NNP must have made him word it that NN because if he had only asked me to marry him I might not have VBN yes . ” The real von Trapps did not secretly cross the alps by NN The family ’s exit from Austria under Nazi occupation was RB given a glossy Hollywood NN , depicting the von Trapps as having to cross the alps on NN to avoid detection . In reality such a journey MD have brought them to directly into Germany , not Switzerland as in the NN . “ Do n’t they VB geography in Hollywood ? Salzburg does not border on Switzerland ! ” complained Maria to a reporter in 1967 . Though they left Austria only a day before the borders were sealed , their actual departure lacked the drama contained in the NN according to documents and interviews contained in the U.S. National Archives . “ We did tell NNS that we were VBG to NNP to sing , ” daughter Maria told Opera NNP in 2003 . “ And we did not climb over mountains with all our heavy suitcases and instruments . We left by train in broad daylight , pretending nothing . ” The von Trapps traveled with their musical conductor , Rev. Franz Wasner , and secretary Martha Zochbauer . On NN Wasner became the fictional Max Detweiler , who remained in Austria . The real journey took the family RB to Italy , where Georg attained citizenship due to his birthplace having become Italian territory in 1920 , then on to London before boarding a ship for NNP . During the early 1940s they toured the U.S. as the Trapp Family Singers , eventually settling in Stowe , Vermont . There they opened a guest NN , which is still owned and operated by descendants of the von Trapp family ."

Avoid_VB wearing_VBG uncomfortable_JJ shoes_NNS ._.","In most NNS , your NN can diagnose a plantar wart with CD or more of these techniques : • Paring the lesion with a scalpel and checking for signs of dark , pinpoint dots — tiny clotted NN vessels • Removing a small section of the lesion ( shave biopsy ) and sending it to a laboratory for analysis Most plantar warts are harmless and VBP away without NN , though it MD take a NN or CD . If your warts are painful or spreading , you MD VB to try treating them with over - the - counter ( nonprescription ) medications or home remedies . You MD need JJ repeated treatments before the warts VBP away , and they MD return later . If your self - care approaches have n't helped , talk with your NN about these treatments : • None Stronger peeling medicine ( salicylic acid ) . Prescription - strength wart medications with salicylic acid work by removing layers of a wart a little bit at a NN . They MD RB stimulate your immune NN 's ability to fight the wart . Your NN will likely suggest you apply the medicine regularly at home , followed by occasional office visits . • None Freezing medicine ( cryotherapy ) . Cryotherapy done at a NN 's office involves applying liquid nitrogen to the wart , either with a spray or a cotton swab . This method can be painful , so your NN MD numb the area RB . The chemical causes a blister to form IN your wart , and the dead tissue sloughs off within a week or so . Cryotherapy MD RB stimulate your immune NN to fight viral warts . You MD need to return to the NN 's office for repeat treatments every CD to four weeks until the wart disappears . Some studies suggest that cryotherapy combined with salicylic acid NN is more effective than just cryotherapy , but further NN is needed . If salicylic acid and freezing medicine do n't work , your NN MD recommend CD or more of the following treatments : • Other acids . Your NN shaves the NN of the wart and applies trichloroacetic acid with a wooden toothpick . You 'll need to return to the NN 's office for repeat treatments every week or so . Side effects include burning and stinging . Between visits , you MD be asked to apply salicylic acid to the wart . • Immune therapy . This method uses medications or solutions to stimulate your immune NN to fight viral warts . Your NN MD inject your warts with a foreign substance ( antigen ) or apply a solution or cream to the warts . • Minor surgery . Your NN cuts away the wart or destroys it by using an electric needle ( electrodesiccation and curettage ) . This procedure can be painful , so your NN will numb your NN RB . Because surgery has a NN of scarring , this method RB is n't VBN to treat plantar warts unless other treatments have failed . • Laser NN . Pulsed - dye laser NN burns closed ( cauterizes ) tiny NN vessels . The infected tissue eventually dies , and the wart falls off . This method requires repeat treatments every three to four weeks . The evidence for the effectiveness of this method is limited , and it can VB NN and potentially scarring . • NN . HPV NN has been VBN with success to treat warts RB though this NN is not specifically targeted toward the wart NN that causes the majority of plantar warts . JJ NNS have removed warts with these self - care tips : • Peeling medicine ( salicylic acid ) . Nonprescription wart removal NNS are available as a patch or liquid . RB , you 're instructed to wash the NN , soak it in warm NN , and gently remove the top layer of softened NN with a pumice stone or emery board . Then after the NN has dried , you apply the solution or patch . Patches are RB changed every 24 to 48 hours . Liquid applications are generally VBN daily . You MD need repeated applications on a regular basis over several weeks to months to VB results . • Freezing medicine ( cryotherapy ) . Nonprescription medicines that freeze the wart include Compound W Freeze Off and Dr. Scholl 's Freeze Away . The Food and NNP Administration cautions that some wart removers are flammable and should n't be VBN IN fire , flame , heat sources ( such as curling irons ) and lit cigarettes . • Duct tape . Using duct tape to remove warts is a harmless but unproven approach . To try it , cover the wart with silver duct tape , changing it every few days . Between applications , soak the wart and gently remove dead tissue with a pumice stone or emery board . Then leave the wart open to the NN to dry for a few hours before covering it with tape again . You 'll likely start by seeing your primary care NN . He or she MD refer you to a specialist in disorders of the NN ( dermatologist ) or NNS ( podiatrist ) . The following tips can VB you prepare for your appointment . What you can do Bring a list of all medications you take regularly — including over - the - counter ( nonprescription ) medications and dietary supplements — and the daily dosage of each . You MD RB VB to list questions for your NN , such as : • If I have a plantar wart , can I start with at - home care ? • If I proceed with home NN , under what conditions should I call you ? • If the JJ NN does n't work , what will we try next ? • If the lesion is n't a plantar wart , what tests do you need to do ? • How RB will it take to VB results ? What to expect from your NN Your NN MD ask you questions such as : • When did the lesion RB appear ? • Has it changed in size or appearance ? • Have you had warts before ? • Do you have diabetes or poor sensation in your NNS ? • Do you have any condition or take any medication that has weakened your ability to fight NN ( immune response ) ? • Have you tried any home remedies ? If so , how RB have you VBN them and have they helped ? • Do you VB a swimming pool or locker room — places that can harbor wart - causing viruses ? What you can do in the meantime If you 're sure you have a plantar wart , you MD try over - the - counter remedies or alternative medicine approaches . But talk with your NN before trying self - care treatments if you have : If pressure on the wart causes NN , try wearing well - cushioned NNS , such as athletic NNS that evenly support the sole and relieve some of the pressure .

The liger has NNS in the same genus but of different NNS . The liger is distinct from the similar hybrid called the tigon , and is the largest of all VBN extant felines . [ 1] [ 2 ] They enjoy swimming , which is a characteristic of tigers , and are very sociable IN lions . Notably , ligers typically grow larger than either parent NNS , unlike tigons . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The history of lion - tiger hybrids dates to at least the early 19th NN in India . In 1798 , Étienne Geoffroy Saint - Hilaire ( 1772 –1844 ) made a colour plate of the offspring of a lion and a tiger . The portmanteau "" liger "" was coined by the 1930s . [ 4 ] In 1825 , G. B. Whittaker made an engraving of liger cubs born in 1824 . [3 ] The NNS and their three liger offspring are RB depicted with their trainer in a 19th - NN painting in the naïve style . CD liger cubs born in 1837 were exhibited to King William IV and to his successor Queen Victoria . On 14 December 1900 and on 31 NNP 1901 , Carl Hagenbeck wrote to zoologist James Cossar Ewart with details and photographs of ligers born at the Hagenbeck 's Tierpark in Hamburg in 1897 . In NNP NNP and the NNP of Nature ( 1902 –1903 ) , A. H. Bryden described Hagenbeck 's "" lion - tiger "" hybrids : It has remained for CD of the most enterprising collectors and naturalists of our NN , Mr. Carl Hagenbeck , not only to breed but to bring successfully to a healthy maturity , specimens of this rare alliance between those CD great and formidable Felidae , the lion and tiger . The illustrations will indicate sufficiently how fortunate Mr. Hagenbeck has been in his efforts to produce these hybrids . The oldest and biggest of the NNS shown is a hybrid born on the 11th NNP 1897 . This fine beast , now more than five NNS JJ , equals and RB excels in his proportions a well - grown lion , measuring as he does from nose tip to tail 10 ft 2 inches in length , and standing only three inches less than 4 ft at the shoulder . A good JJ lion will weigh about 400 lb [...] the hybrid in question , weighing as it does no less than 467 lb , is certainly the superior of the most well - grown lions , whether wild - bred or born in a menagerie . This NN shows faint striping and mottling , and , in its characteristics , exhibits strong traces of both its NNS . It has a somewhat lion - JJ head , and the tail is more IN that of a lion than of a tiger . On the other hand , it has no trace of mane . It is a huge and very powerful beast . [ 5 ] In 1935 , four ligers from CD litters were reared in the Zoological Gardens of Bloemfontein , NNP Africa . Three of them , a male and CD females , were still living in 1953 . The male weighed 340 kg ( 750 lb ) and stood a NN and a half ( 45 cm ) taller than a full grown male lion at the shoulder . Although ligers are more commonly VBN than tigons today , in At Home in the Zoo ( 1961 ) , Gerald Iles wrote "" For the record I must VB that I have never seen a liger , a hybrid obtained by crossing a lion with a tigress . They seem to be RB rarer than tigons . "" [ 6 ] The liger is often believed to represent the largest VBN cat in the NN . [ 1 ] Males reach a total length of 3 to 3.6 m ( 9.8 to 11.8 ft ) , [ 7 ] [ 8 ] which means that they rival RB JJ male lions and tigers in length . [ 9 ] Imprinted genes MD be a factor contributing to the JJ size of ligers . [ 10 ] These are genes that MD or MD not be expressed on the parent they are inherited from , and that occasionally play a role in issues of hybrid growth . For example , in some dog breed crosses , genes that are expressed only when maternally - inherited VBP the JJ to grow larger than is typical for either parent breed . This growth is not seen in the paternal breeds , as such genes are normally "" counteracted "" by genes inherited from the female of the appropriate breed . [ 11 ] Other JJ cat hybrids can reach similar sizes ; the litigon , a rare hybrid of a male lion and a female tigon , is roughly the same size as the liger , with a male named Cubanacan ( at the Alipore Zoo in India ) reaching 363 kg ( 800 lb ) . [ 12 ] The extreme rarity of these second - generation hybrids MD VB it difficult to ascertain whether they are larger or smaller , on average , than the liger . It is wrongly believed that ligers continue to grow throughout their lives due to hormonal issues . [ 13 ] It MD be that they simply grow far more during their growing NNS and take longer to reach their full adult size . Further growth in shoulder height and NN length is not seen in ligers over six NNS JJ , as in both lions and tigers . Male ligers RB have the same levels of testosterone on average as an adult male lion , yet are azoospermic in accordance with Haldane 's rule . In addition , female ligers MD RB attain great size , weighing approximately 320 kg ( 705 lb ) and reaching 3.05 m ( 10 ft ) RB on average , and are often fertile . In contrast , pumapards ( hybrids between pumas and leopards ) tend to exhibit dwarfism . Ligers are about the same size as the prehistoric Smilodon populator and JJ lion . Hercules , the largest non-obese liger , is recognised by the Guinness Book of NNP Records as the largest living cat on NNP , weighing 418.2 kg ( 922 lb ) . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Hercules was featured on the Today Show , Good Morning NNP , Anderson Cooper 360 , Inside Edition , and in a Maxim article in 2005 , when he was only three NNS JJ and already weighed 408.25 kg ( 900 lb ) . The Valley of the Kings NNP Sanctuary in Wisconsin had a male liger named Nook who weighed over 550 kg ( 1,213 lb ) . [ 2 ] [ 16 ] To compare , the records for the lion and tiger in captivity are under 1,100 pounds ( 500 kg ) . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Shasta , a ligress ( female liger ) was born at the Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City on 14 NNP 1948 and died in 1972 at age 24 . [ CD ] Nook died in 2007 , at 21 NNS JJ . [ 2 ] [ 16 ] Hobbs , a male liger at the Sierra Safari Zoo in Reno , Nevada , lived to almost 15 NNS of age before succumbing to liver failure and weighed 450 kg ( 992 lb ) . [ 20 ] This liger was born in 1943 and died in 1960 . NNP Africa has CD ligers at its zoo at Bloemfontein . [ 21 ] The fertility of hybrid JJ cat females is well documented across a number of different hybrids . This is in accordance with Haldane 's rule : in hybrids of NNS whose sex is determined by sex chromosomes , if CD sex is absent , rare or sterile , it is the heterogametic sex ( the NN with CD different sex chromosomes e.g. X and Y ) .[ clarification needed ] According to Wild Cats of the NNP ( 1975 ) by C. A. W. Guggisberg , ligers and tigons were RB thought to be sterile ; however , in 1943 , a fifteen - NN - JJ hybrid between a lion and an ' Island ' tiger was successfully mated with a lion at the Munich Hellabrunn Zoo . The female cub , though of delicate NN , was raised to adulthood . [ 22 ] In September 2012 , the Russian Novosibirsk Zoo announced the birth of a "" liliger "" , which is the offspring of a liger mother and a lion father . The cub was named Kiara . [ 23 ] Ligers have a tiger - JJ striped pattern that is very faint upon a lionesque tawny background . In addition , they MD inherit rosettes from the lion parent ( lion cubs are rosetted and some adults retain faint markings ) . These markings MD be black , dark brown or sandy . The background color MD be correspondingly tawny , sandy or golden . In common with tigers , their underparts are pale . The actual pattern and color depend on which subspecies the NNS were and on how the genes interact in the offspring . White tigers have been crossed with lions to produce "" white "" ( actually pale golden ) ligers . In NN , white tigers MD be crossed with white lions to produce white , very pale or RB stripeless ligers . There are no black ligers . Very few melanistic tigers have ever been recorded , most being due to excessive markings ( pseudo - melanism or abundism ) rather than true melanism ; no reports of black lions have ever been substantiated . As blue or Maltese tigers probably no longer exist , gray or blue ligers are exceedingly improbable . It is not impossible for a liger to be white , but it is very rare .

A deeper look at the symbolism in these videos reveals the disturbing story of a JJ girl ’s abuse inside the elite ’s NN of mind NN . While she only obtained mainstream success in 2014 , Sia has been hard at work in the music industry for NNS . In addition to her own six studio albums , Sia has written hit songs for the NN ’s biggest pop stars including Beyonce , Rihanna , Britney Spears and Rita Ora . If you ’re a reader of Vigilant Citizen , you already VBP that ALL of these artists have been mentioned on this NN because they have all been VBN to push the elite ’s Agenda at some point or another in their careers . Sia is , therefore , not a stranger to the higher ups of the music industry and the messages it wants to perpetuate . The imagery associated with Sia ’s sixth album 1000 Forms of Fear is RB in line with the elite ’s ongoing Agenda , which includes the sexualization of NNS , the normalization of ritual abuse , and the promotion of mind NN . While these are strong words to describe videos of a JJ girl dancing while wearing a wig , the plethora of symbols surrounding the NN trilogy strongly points in that direction . The album cover features the blond wig worn by Sia and Maddie Ziegler . This blond wig represents the concept of alter persona . The creation of alter personas is the main goal of Monarch mind NN ( if you do n’t VB what I am referring to , read this article RB ) and , coincidentally , NNS of Beta Kitten programming are often made to wear blond wigs . In the videos , this wig is worn by Maddie Ziegler , who is a typical child star raised by a twisted industry . Maddie Ziegler began dancing at the age of 2 and , at age 8 , appeared on Dance Moms , a “ reality TV ” show that I will never watch because it MD probably VB me severe nausea and intense chest NN . I have come across a few screenshots from the show and … they gave me severe nausea and intense chest NN . The show is CD is yet another excuse to dress JJ girls in slutty outfits and putting them on TV . Ziegler has RB appeared in a few Disney TV shows ( the ultimate launch pad of screw up child stars ) . Today , at age 12 , things are getting out of hand . Maddie Ziegler is yet another example of a child star who grew up in an industry ruled by sick NNS who prey on the innocence of NNS . Sia ’s videos symbolically describe the dark side of this entire NN . Let ’s look at the videos . If PRP listens to Chandelier without watching the NN , it appears to be about a girl who parties and gets drunk in order to keep sadness and desperation at bay . Some parts of the lyrics indicate that the “ NN for a good NN call ” might actually be in the “ pleasure for NNS ” industry . She “ parties ” ( works ) all night , but she actually feels miserable . She gets wasted to become blind to the NN and numb from the NN . However , at the end of the night , the NN sheds light on the harshness of her reality . While the song might have heavy implications that can be interpreted in several ways , the NN adds an RB more disturbing dimension by featuring a 12 - NN - JJ girl in a NN - colored spandex suit dancing ecstatically to it . The NN plunges the song into the dark NN of mind NN , where abandoned NNS deal with trauma , abuse , and multiple personalities . The NN features Maddie Ziegler dancing inside a grimy and abandoned apartment with strange drawings ( apparently drawn by her ) hanging on the wall . The NN ends with a shot of Maddie standing in the doorway while the image blurs , making it appear as if she is wearing nothing ( I wo n’t RB post a screenshot of this ) . This probably pleased child lovers watching the NN . Elastic Heart goes RB further . Featuring a near - naked Shia Labeouf wrestling with Maddie Ziegler inside a cage , the Elastic Heart NN sparked some mass NN controversy due to its pedophile undertones . This RB prompted Sia to apologize on NNP . It is interesting that Sia “ anticipated ” the “ cries ” , but went with it anyway . This is not the kind of subject to take lightly , especially considering the fact that countless NNS have been traumatized by it . It is RB interesting that Sia felt that Shia Labeouf was the only dancer who plays that role in her NN . As I stated my article What is Happening to Shia Labeouf , Shia has been involved , in several ways , in the disturbing NN of MK , including growing up as Disney child star . Recently , he was the star of the NN Fjögur Píanó , which was clearly about Monarch programming ( VB my article about it here ) and over the past NNS , he has displayed the kind of erratic behavior that is typical of MK slaves . In an interview with Interview Magazine , Shia described the difficult relationship with his father by using terms that can RB be applied to mind NN handlers . So , yes , I suppose Shia is the JJ NN to play a role in a trilogy that revolves IN mind NN . Is Shia playing the role of his own manipulative father in the NN ? Is he a predatory abuser ? Do the dancers represent warring NNS in Sia ’s head ? Maybe all of the above . Maddie reacts to the “ advances ” ( for lack of a better word ) by acting IN an NN , biting Shia ’s hand and roaring at him , as if she knew what was coming . However , Maddie warms up to Shia and gets close to him . Sometimes NNS do n’t VB the boundary between love and abuse . This NN featuring CD lost souls in a strange setting with disturbing undertones ends sadly . While it is difficult to exactly pinpoint what went on in Elastic Heart , the NNP Girls Cry NN is obvious … for those “ in the NN ” . While the song is about “ JJ girls ” being heartbroken , the NN features a little girl for three and a half minutes . During that NN , the girl played again by Maggie Ziegler , performs all kinds of facial expressions that end up telling a story . And , she does indeed mimic the abuse and trauma suffered by an MK slave . When PRP understands what this is truly about , the NN is actually quite clear , RB blatant . The NN ends with the final product of the traumatizing and dehumanizing process of mind NN . Sia ’s NN trilogy tells a story that is dark and disturbing . It will , however , remain a mystery to most viewers because most of them VBP “ Wow , that ’s so creative and artistic ” without truly understanding what it is about . The videos all star Maddie Ziegler , a child performer that is sadly becoming another face of the mass NN ’s obsession with child exploitation . Each NN in the trilogy describes a different aspect of mind NN , creating a disturbing narrative .

The grisly find was made earlier this month by Mike Johns as he walked his dog along the scenic southern coast of Vancouver Island . After a JJ object tangled in sea kelp captured the dog ’s attention , Johns leaned in for a closer look . What he saw was a fibula and tibia attached to a left NN , all of it encased in a white sock and black Velcro shoe . “ By the looks of it , the NN was totally intact . The ankle bone still worked and the bones were attached at the base of the knee , ” Johns told CTV NNP . After calling police , Johns carried the NN home for safekeeping , worried that high tides might wash the NN back into the ocean or that it MD attract the attention of wildlife in the area . The find was the latest in a series that has sparked speculation IN the NN . Since 2007 , another dozen NNS have washed up in British Columbia , each of them clad in running NNS . Some point to natural disasters , such as the 2004 tsunami , or plane or boat accidents at sea . Others theorise that the NNS might be the work of a serial killer or organised crime . At times pranksters have RB sought to add fuel to the fire . “ We ’ve had NNS put dog NN skeletons in runners and leave them on the beach , ” Barb McLintock of the BC coroner ’s office told the Guardian the last NN a NN washed up , in February CD . “ And somebody RB VBD JJ chicken bones . ” In the past dozen NNS , the provincial coroner ’s office has ruled out foul play , noting that none of the NNS showed signs of trauma . They have identified eight of the NNS , saying they included CD pairs , and determined that the remaining lone NNS belonged to NNS . All of the individuals either killed themselves or died accidentally , with their NNS naturally coming apart from their bodies during decomposition , VBD the coroner . The ubiquitous presence of running NNS might explain some of the mystery . Made with light but durable materials , the NNS both protect the NN from decomposition and act as a flotation device that pulls it to the NN . In the latest NN , authorities are attempting to identify the NN and a NN of death . Police are scouring databases to VB if there are any matches with missing persons NNS and have VBN that foul play is not suspected at this point . The investigation is in its early stages and MD eventually be broadened , VBD Andy Watson of the BC coroner ’s office . “ It MD RB include working with agencies RB of the border , because with the tides and the coastline this MD have come from another jurisdiction too . ” Watson VBD he was n’t sure why the number of NNS VBN in British Columbia had climbed into double digits in recent NNS . “ I do n’t RB have a succinct reason as to why that is , ” he VBD . “ You VBP , you look at the sheer nature of the geography and how JJ the coastline is . ”"

A number of different types of arthritis can VB NN NN . Sometimes the cartilage wears away between the bones . Without the protective cartilage , bones rub together . This inflames the tissue and causes NN and swelling . If you ’re experiencing NN NN , read on to find out if arthritis MD be the NN . NN arthritis is caused by inflammation of the NN joint . The NN most often attacks the JJ NN , but the others MD be affected as well . Past injuries or traumas , such as a broken or sprained NN , can VB arthritis down the road . Osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , and gout MD RB be to blame . NNS who wear tight , high - heeled NNS for much of their lives MD RB be at NN for NN arthritis . NN is most likely the JJ noticeable symptom of arthritis . You MD feel a general NN in the NNS or only the JJ NN . NNS describe it as ranging from a deep , achy feeling to a sharper , stabbing sensation when they try to move . It MD be minor , moderate , or severe depending on the level of deterioration or inflammation in the joint . NN is CD of the most common and debilitating NNS of arthritis . It can stop you from enjoying your normal daily activities . Over NN , arthritis wears away at the cartilage between joints , inflames tissues , and damages synovial fluid . All these changes can VB joints stiff and difficult to move . With less cushioning and support , joints become resistant to bending and stretching . This can result in difficulty walking , as the NNS play a JJ part in balance and in pushing the NN off the ground . It MD hurt when you try to walk because the NN joint moves with every step . All types of arthritis VBP inflammation in the joint , which can result in visible swelling . The NNS MD turn red and feel warm to the touch . You MD notice this symptom after you have been sitting for a while , or after you VBP out of bed . Swelling can RB VB it difficult to put your NNS on in the morning . They MD feel tight until you walk RB a while and the swelling goes down . You VBP how it sounds when you crack your knuckles ? You MD start to hear similar sounds in your NNS if you have arthritis . A grinding noise is a fairly common symptom as well . These sounds are caused by the deterioration of the cartilage that typically cushions the CD bones in a joint . As that cartilage wears away , the bones MD rub against CD another , causing these sounds . If bone spurs develop , they can RB VB clicks and cracks . Does your NN look bigger than it VBD to ? Is it starting to rotate away from your NN ? These occurrences can be NNS of NN arthritis . As the cartilage wears away and the bone grinds against bone , the NN attempts to VB the situation better . Its solution is to create more bone . Although this MD stabilize the joint , it can RB VB it appear larger , or IN it has a JJ bump on it , not unlike the appearance of having bunions . It MD send the NN off in a JJ direction , creating a curved NN or what is sometimes called “ claw NNS . ” When inflammation brings more NN to your NNS , you MD feel a sense of warmth or heat in the area . It can be mildly irritating , but it RB does n’t interfere with your daily activities . You MD RB VB redness on the NN IN the joints , and they MD become tender to the touch . A locked joint can happen when there is so much swelling and stiffness that the joint is no longer able to bend at all . Rough edges on the bones and bone spurs can RB VB a joint to lock up . It MD feel IN the NN is stuck , and it can be painful . This is RB not a permanent condition . You MD have to walk RB for a while , or try to manipulate the NN to bend again ."

Trolls are employees that answered a work at home job ad on craigslist or some other venue . The geoengineering trolls , specifically , are employed by the CD main disinformation sites , metaxxxx and contrailxxxxxxx , both run by a gaming programmer . He and his band of hired internet trolls lack expertise in NN , meteorology or any other field related to geoengineering , yet claim to be experts in atmospheric NN , and fancy themselves “ debunkers ” . Shillidiocy is a term that best describes the rapidly growing industry of NNS ready and willing to sell out humanity for a few pennies IN comment . Disinformation has been VBN throughout history for political purposes and these strategies are being utilized today by these paid internet trolls . ( Psychological Warfare – discredit , distract , intimidate , frustrate , divide & conquer ) – Disinformation shills often VBP outrageous comments for the sole purpose of deflecting focus from the NN to distract us by creating a “ controversial debate ” where none truly exists . Often , trolls VBP the “ Trojan Horse ” method to attempt to elicit an emotional response from NNS RB , to evoke hostility with the intent of twisting it RB to VB the NN look volatile , a classic “ character assassination ” tactic to discredit them , making them appear weak . On some occasions , they intentionally keep pushing a NN into a heated argument , and will VB so far as to “ report ” the NN as being a “ threat ” to try to VB them kicked off of the forum . Another major character assassination tactic is to highlight any negative or perceived flaw of an otherwise reputable NN , whether true or JJ , to intentionally discredit them in an attempt to invalidate their viewpoint and VB them seem baseless , to detract focus from the information they are sharing . The trolls often “ VB stuff up ” if they ca n’t find anything real to highlight for this goal , after all , shills are paid liars . Another trick these liars are taught is to VB semantics to twist NNS ’s words RB and VB it seem as though they ’ve lied , to discredit them . These are all character assassination tactics that you will easily recognize happening all over the internet once you become familiar with them . Disinformation shills sometimes pose as a supporter of the NN , or “ friendly folks on the fence ” politely asking simple questions , in a sly attempt to later discredit the movement . Often trolls posing as friendly allies will resort to posting JJ , incoherent diatribes ( RB on JJ blogs & articles ) for the purpose of associating the movement with insanity ; or other times to act as a “ the voice of reason ” and create a debate ( where none exists ) to VB it appear as though the NNS is n’t strong enough , and they offer to play “ devil ’s advocate ” to “ VB the movement ” , then render any and all NNS as invalid regardless of how legitimate the source . They will “ demand proof ” then ignore it when it ’s presented , or continue to demand impossible proofs . Regardless of what material MD be presented by an opponent in JJ forums , they will deem the material irrelevant and demand unattainable proof that is virtually impossible for the opponent to retrieve ; for the purpose of detracting focus from the mounds of legitimate NNS available for those of us that take the NN to do some real research beyond the disinformation NN links . Trolls often interject themselves into productive web discussions in order to VB themselves appear credible as though they have a “ real ” argument , where none actually exists . Their job is to create controversy and instigate a “ debate ” . They scour the net and attack awareness videos , articles , blogs , JJ NN pages , etc. , posting links from metaxxxx or conxxxxxscience , but fail to post legitimate links with verifiable references . They relentlessly keep commenting on a thread to dominate the discussion with the intent to keep their comments at the very top . They RB vote their comments up and everyone else ’s comments down , ( if the forum offers that feature ) . This is evident when you become familiar with their methods . I have yet to VB a disinformation shill post a reputable link , or ANY link , other than from those CD disinformation sites . In addition , they adamantly refuse to look at real NNS . They intentionally divert attention from credible documentation , dismissing it without examination . They regurgitate the same tired harassing insults , and repetitive generic jargon about how NN vapor condensation trails are formed , which has nothing to do with the persistent , spreading , lingering trails we often VBP covering the sky that is being done as “ scientific research ” , the prelude to fully implementing JJ geoengineering programs . Trolls are supplied with a list or database with preplanned talking points and a format designed as generalized and deceptive responses to honest arguments . Geoengineering ( chemtrails ) “ debunker ” trolls are notorious for this , and note they never actually “ debunk ” anything . All they do is deflect from the NN to try to cast doubt and keep the denial tactic VBG so the profiteers of geoengineering can continue to suppress JJ outcry in order to keep spraying us without us balking and rising up to stop them . If you pay close attention and track the trolls , you will VB that they often post the same comments over and over on JJ different threads . This works hand in hand with # 1 ( character assassination ) , and the “ Trojan Horse ” troll . The goal is to sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule , engaging them in a hostile argument to try to discredit them , RB VBN as the “ attack the messenger ” ploy . The goal of “ JJ association ” is to associate opponents with unpopular titles such as “ paranoid NN theorist ” to VB them look crazy and try to discredit them , or call them derogatory names such as “ chemtard ” , “ ignorant ” , or “ liar ” , attempting to invalidate anything they VBP regardless of how true it is . The trolls seek to deliberately associate the movement with far fetched concepts IN “ NNP NNP ” , aliens , JJ flag NN NNS , etc. , because of the inherent negative connotations , ( tying in with “ character assassination ” ) . The ultimate goal is to provoke argument , create biases , and dissuade NNS from objectively examining any evidence presented . Pretending to be the “ voice of reason ” in an argument with obvious and defined sides in an attempt to move NNS away from what is clearly true , into the murky waters of “ doubt ” where the NN becomes “ relative . ” And if that does n’t work they will antagonize and goad opponents with insults , name calling , and bullying . If they ca n’t do anything else , they will chide and taunt their opponents and draw them into emotional responses with the goal of making them look foolish or mentally unbalanced , in hopes of rendering their point invalid merely by shifting focus to show how “ sensitive they are to criticism ” , in an attempt to deflect from their point and invalidate any NNS they are presenting . This is why it ’s best to ignore their taunting . A very common technique is that the troll will accuse his opposition of subscribing to a certain point of view , RB if he does not , will VB it appear so , then attack that point of view ( Straw NN ) . Or , the troll will put words in the mouth of his opposition , and then rebut those specific words . He will VB conjecture , ridicule , and accusation to try and prove himself as valid while discrediting others with absolutely nothing , shouting “ you have no argument , that is just ad hominem ” , which is ironically , exactly what he is doing . The troll is trained to appear confident , unwavering , and that he is undoubtedly JJ , when in reality , it ’s the exact opposite . Basically , he is a paid liar and his goal is to create doubt and discredit the NN . When the internet shill realizes NNS are aware of his tactics , he will try to play nice , act innocent , and pose a seemingly “ harmless ” leading question . William01702 , VBN tactic #s 6 , 8 , and 2 to troll the NN ( link below ) of the courageous Kristen Meghan , who stands strong to do what is JJ in the face of adversity to warn NNS about geoengineering and the disinformation sites . If you watch the NN and listen to her , it is clear what is happening with the rampant disinformation in our mainstream ; PAID shills are ready and willing to contribute to the demise of our NN , and sell out their humanity to perpetuate lies for a measly buck . The shill “ Hama Neggs ” RB trolled it with some derogatory comments about Kristen Meghan using # 1 ( character assassination ) . These troll ’s comments MD , or MD not , VB deleted by the page moderator ; but if they remain , notice the date and how quickly they VBD it . It ’s their job to scour the net and attack , so in NN , RB if theirs VBP deleted , more paid trolls will appear . If you check other awareness videos , you ’ll VB the same usernames in action repetitively . Save LI Forum – 09 – Kristen Meghan – Geo-engineering The following bold , italic quotes are actual troll comments made by username William01702 who is VBN to routinely attack NNP geoengineering awareness videos . “ MD you please tell me what “ disinformation ” you have VBN on Metabunk or contrailscience ? I mean , you claim the information is n’t factual , and then provide no evidence to support such a claim . Why ? ” … “ It RB is a legitimate question which deserves an answer . Despite what paranoid liars IN GalileoGalileisGhost VBP . ” ( If William01702 was just a random viewer , why MD he care whether those sites have been exposed as disinformation , and “ demand proof ” , unless he IS an associate ( a paid shill ) ? The answer becomes evident if you notice how he followed with the classic “ JJ association ” & “ Trojan Horse ” tactic to disparage shill buster , GalileoGalileisGhost . MD a random user that ’s not associated with those disinformation sites have VB to do this ) ? William01702 – on a different thread : ( note the contrast when confronted for his shill activity ) : “ I ’m not a troll I ’m just someone who is better educated in atmospheric NN and aviation than all chemtards , combined . ” ( notice his derogatory NN of the word “ CHEMTARDS ” a classic Trojan Horse move ) . William01702 : “ Chemtards MD n’t be more stupid if they wanted to be . You NNS are evil alarmists who spread fear , hate , and ignorance VBN on a lack of education . I pity the chemtards ! ” ( does that sound IN someone educated in atmospheric sciences or anything else for that matter ) ? William01702 wrote this on an entirely different thread : “ Oh RB and where do they VB that THIS trail has ANYTHING to do with what they have “ admitted to ” . NO WHERE ! It ’s hilarious that you NNS read about some basic testing and then assume everything you VBP in the sky must be related to such testing . Chemtards are idiots ! Oh , and BTW show me where anyone has admitted to any such thing ! If you VBP HR2977 you ’re a fucking moron ! ” William01702 wrote this on yet another thread ( verbatim , spelling errors & all ) : “ Tat should have read “ because you are too stupid and lazy to understand basic fucking NN ” . But , does it matter ?! Will it VB anything ?! No , you will always assume that just because you hate / fear the NN that it must mean that you and your chemtard friends must be JJ about the trails in the sky . Nevermind the fact that you have never actually studed these subjects ! You have visited NN sites ! You VBP it all real pilots are just STUPID for VBG to school for NNS ! ” William01702 on yet another thread : “ Poor chemtards unable to understand he difference between an intentional nefarious release of chemicals and business as usual ” . William01702 and yet another thread : “ Why do you NNS pretend to understand that minor differences in temperature , engine NN settings , engine types , and engine size can result in differences in trails , when its obvious that you are all fucking clueless !!! This NN is n’t evidence of anything more than the ignorance of chemtards ” ! William01702 on a NN about chemical fallout from geoengineering ( notice the pattern from the previous comments ) : “ Yup , I ’m sure that she is a moron . And so are you . There is ZERO evidence that this “ affliction ” has ANYTHING to do with the trails in the sky . NONE ! It ’s nothing more than paranoid fantasy made up by those who VBP to pick at their NN . And you are JJ , she IS just CD moron in a line of JJ . By the NN accepting ignorant bullshit from OTHER paranoid losers on the internet is NOT “ research ” . ” William01702 wrote these comments on various videos as well : “ Stupid chemtards ” , “ Idiot ” , “ Moron ” , AND “ that is technology that is not only JJ knowledge , but is highly regulated . It RB has nothing to do with any trails in the sky . That ’s the problem with you NNS . You are completely ignorant but are too stupid to VB it ” ! Compare the subsequent comments with the name calling & insults , to the JJ NN that was on a NN where his disinformation sites were brought to light and notice how he tried to recover by looking innocent & friendly despite his hostility and antagonistic comments on other awareness videos . Who are these trolls that have NN to sit RB and VB comments on NNP all day and night , and WHY target awareness videos ? The answer is clear , they are SHILLS . I took photos of the comment pages in the likely event that this loathsome user attempts to attack this blog and denies ever making those comments . So , unless he deletes all of his comments from all the NNP awareness videos he has attacked , and closes his account , ( let ’s hope he does ) , you can plainly VB his existing comments ( and more ) on NNP by checking his page activity or tracking him on awareness videos . Just remember not to let the trolls bait you . They VBP PAID to antagonize you and LURE you to those disinformation sites . It is apparent that some of these shills share usernames and have round the clock shifts because no NN is RB that often to target that JJ awareness videos without backup . William01702 is joined by VBN shills such as Hama Neggs ( a particularly loathsome troll ) , Lizoir , Terry Ram , Nwoflyer , epsilon892 , Niglet Gook , Belfrey1 , Jazzaconda , Baba Loo , MrFubar75 , and several other usernames that have been identified as paid shills / trolls , all utilizing the same tactics and associated with the CD VBN disinformation sites , employed by gaming programmer , the grand daddy of them all , Mick We$t , ( or at least that ’s the name he “ goes by ” ) . Their format is always the same and they often attack in teams to “ back each other up ” . Anyone that does a little digging will find these same usernames frequently darkening awareness videos all over NNP , regurgitating insults , performing their usual antagonistic , tactical routine , and attempting to lure NNS over to their disinformation sites because they VBP compensated for it . Less frequently , you ’ll VB these strategies mimicked by average NNS in the mainstream that have willfully succumbed to cognitive dissonance and easily fallen prey to the disinformation tactics that have been VBN on them . They seem happy to regurgitate the lies they have been told and are content to post links only from those disinformation sites , while refusing to look at any other credible NNS presented to them . It ’s IN a mass Stockholm Syndrome in which their limited intellects are easily held hostage by their disinformation captors , and they ’ve fallen “ in love ” with Mick We$t and his band of marauding minions . These victims of mass brainwashing RB exhibit the common trait among trolls , of refusing to examine credible , verifiable , REAL NNS ( such as several scholarly documents that can be VBN through this link : http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=geoengineering+modeling+studies&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart&sa=X&ei=e-q_UcHDCMjPiwLk4YEY&ved=0CC0QgQMwAA)._ADD Sadly , NNS ’s refusal to examine any NNS beyond the disinformation sites , means success for the disinformation NN . Getting the NN to do their bidding , not only meets the goal of “ divide and conquer ” in the battle to pit us against each other , it keeps us distracted , engaged in their fictitious debate , and prevents us from focusing on the fact that heavy metals such as aluminum , barium , and strontium , and other toxic chemicals such as sulphuric acid , and silver iodide , are being sprayed into our NN supply globally for the purpose of Weather Modification and NN Engineering . In this NN on awareness , the NN becomes irrelevant , and the sleepwalkers , happy to remain blissfully ignorant , are proud to belong to the band of trolls that have , ironically , convinced them that we are the “ ignorant ” ones , and that they are the geniuses that have all the answers . The telltale difference between mass cognitive dissonance and a paid internet troll , is that the trolls RB have obscure usernames , no profile pic ( or a generic NN ) and if you track their previous comments on other threads , you will VB that they have attacked using the same format over and over ; in addition to attempting to lure NNS to the disinformation sites , where they VBP compensated to engage them in a futile “ debate ” , waste NNS ’s NN and distract them from spending NN increasing awareness in their local community , and doing REAL research ongeoengineering . Do n’t let the trolls VB you to feel stupid for considering that geoengineering MD be a reality and suppress your awareness . Keep watching the sky and research information beyond the fixed mainstream search engines . Watch the documentaries , Look Up ! and What in the NN are They Spraying ? , take notes and look up the information presented . The NNP is there for anyone that is intelligent enough to look past the deceit & lies . WHAT YOU CAN DO TO AVOID THE TROLLS 1 ) Never “ reply to ” them ; ( do not fall for their tactics ) . 2 ) REPORT them , because what they ’re doing is a form of cyber - BULLYING . 3 ) On your page , DELETE their comments and BLOCK them . Share this information to increase awareness and disempower their lies . Visit reputable sites such as NNP Skywatch and GeoengineeringWatch.org for more information about how geoengineering adversely affects our NN , and is damaging our NN ’s ability to sustain NN ."

""_''","A rare , multispecies brawl unfolded recently in the deep ocean off the coast of Hawaii . In CD corner , an oceanic whitetip shark ( Carcharhinus longimanus ) — a 7 - NN - JJ ( 2.1 meters ) predator capable of diving up to 1,000 NNS ( 300 m ) below the NN in pursuit of prey . In the other corner … it 's not clear . But whatever it was , it was huge , it had tentacles and it put up a hell of a fight . Undersea photographer Deron Verbeck caught the aftermath of this mysterious scrap when he snapped a picture of the offending shark , scarred all along its flank with strange circular patterns and dots . According to a NN published June 3 in the Journal of Fish Biology , there are only a handful of creatures in Hawaiian waters capable of creating scars IN that , and they are all enormous cephalopods . While it 's impossible to be sure what exactly scarred the shark , the NNS argue that it MD have been a "" phantom of the deep "" — another name for the elusive NN squid ( Architeuthis dux ) . Related : NN squid filmed alive for second NN in history . Here 's the NN . NN squids are mysterious denizens of the deep ocean , thought to be able to grow anywhere from 33 to 43 NNS ( 10 to 13 m ) in length . They are poorly studied because they live so deep underwater — typically about 1,000 NNS ( 300 m ) down or more , the NNS wrote . Their deep dwellings put the JJ squids not only out of reach of most NNS , but RB JJ MD - be predators . The oceanic whitetip shark MD be an exception , the NNS wrote . Because the sharks are VBN to dive to extreme depths on foraging missions , it 's feasible that an unlucky whitetip MD find itself snoot - to - sucker with a JJ squid . That MD be what happened to the scarred shark in the photo . According to the NNS , the series of circular marks along the shark 's back and side are shaped exactly IN the suckers on a JJ squid 's tentacles . From the size of the markings , the offending squid must have been at least the same size as the shark ( at least 7 NNS , or 2 meters , JJ ) and was possibly RB larger , the NNS wrote . Only three types of squids VBN to inhabit Hawaiian waters MD have created the marks , the NN concluded : a squid in the genus Thysanoteuthis or Megalocranchia ( both VBN to grow up to nearly 7 NNS ) or the JJ squid . JJ other details of the encounter remain a mystery . For example , who threw the JJ punch ? ( Or bite ? Or slap ? ) According to the NNS , this is the JJ NN such JJ tentacle markings have been observed on a shark , so it 's hard to VB whether the shark was acting in offense or defense . However , "" the lack of any obvious wounding suggests they were more likely defensive ( i.e. the shark attacked the cephalopod ) , "" the NNS wrote in the NN . "" Similar scarring patterns are seen on sperm whales , well - VBN predators of JJ cephalopods . "" When pressed for details on the encounter , the shark responded merely : "" You should VB the other guy . """

""_''","With the round - the - clock British NN coverage of the royal family in the days leading up to the JJ day for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle , it MD be hard not to conclude that this NN 's wedding of weddings is a source of delight for every Briton . But not everyone in Britain remains as excited as the thousands already crowding into Windsor to claim a spot that will allow them to grab a glimpse of the wedding couple and the pomp and circumstance . JJ NN was littered with all kinds of memes deriding the wedding ceremony . Oscar - winning British actress Emma Thompson chimed in , telling a TV interviewer : "" There 's not a single thought about it in my head to share with you . "" And some viewers are expressing frustration with the incessant focus on the wedding — on the preparations , who 's coming and not , what the couple will wear and what they will eat . The BBC Breakfast show incurred the wrath of some for its all - consuming focus on the royal wedding and its constant and breathless updates . On NNP some viewers grumbled : "" Non-stop coverage of the # RoyalWedding on @BBCBreakfast this morning . Thankfully , there 's no other NN happening at all , "" CD wrote . Another remarked : "" REPORT SOME ACTUAL BL ***Y NN # bbcbreakfast # RoyalWedding . "" The activist anti-monarchy group Republic , which wants the monarchy abolished and replaced with an elected head of NN , demanded on its NN Friday that the BBC and other British channels stop celebrating the royal wedding and report in a balanced NN . "" The monarchy is a contentious issue . It provides us with a head of NN and lies at the heart of our constitution . This issue must be treated by broadcasters as politics , not entertainment , "" VBD Graham Smith of Republic . "" The BBC has willfully ignored a string of stories that might put a different complexion on the wedding story . They continue to celebrate and promote the monarchy , not simply report on it . "" Republic VBD BBC NN had largely ignored stories about the removal of homeless NNS from streets in Windsor and "" widespread criticism "" of how much NN the British taxpayer will have to pay for the wedding . It pointed to a poll conducted by YouGov this week that suggested nearly a third of the British NN MD VB to VB the monarchy abolished . The poll showed the Scottish as the least likely to VB the queen or care about the future of the monarchy , with key findings showing that NN of the border with England fewer than half of Scots approve of the queen and most VBP that Britain 's lawmakers should swear allegiance to the NN and not the monarch . Three - quarters of Scots told the pollsters they were not interested in Saturday 's wedding . Royal critics have highlighted the bad NN for the monarchy in the poll . But overall the royal family and the institution of the nonarchy remains popular , with 68 percent of the British NN believing the institution is good for the NN . The poll coincided with an important landmark for the queen , who is now the longest - serving monarch in British history , overtaking Queen Victoria 's reign of 63 NNS , seven months and CD days . Despite the mounting criticism during the week of the JJ costs of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle 's JJ day , the royal family tried to disarm possible criticism early by announcing that they MD meet the costs of the wedding itself . But because they RB receive NN from taxpayers , it was unclear how much of their private NN MD defray the costs . And British taxpayers will still have to VB a huge bill to cover the security and municipal costs . Thames Valley police will be providing most of the security in Windsor . The last royal wedding in 2011 between Prince William and Kate Middleton cost nearly $ 8.7 CD , according to Britain 's Press Association . Some commentators VBD the costs should be lower this NN because the wedding is being held outside London , reducing logistical challenges . British minsters declined to comment on spending related to the royal wedding , saying no information MD be released before the event . But Britain 's Independent newspaper reported Friday that the cost of the JJ event MD be much higher than previously thought . Wedding planning service Bridebook VBD the wedding itself MD most likely cost $ 43 CD . And some security analysts estimated the security bill at $ 40 CD — a JJ jump from the 2011 royal wedding because of heightened threat levels in Britain following a string of terror attacks over the past 18 months . British ministers VBP any JJ NN VBN for the wedding is NN well spent , arguing the event will encourage more tourists — especially Americans — to visit Britain . But no evidence was supplied by the NN to show that that was the NN in 2011 . "" These royal weddings epitomize the British monarchy 's fondness for reverse Robin Hood economics , whereby wealth is redistributed from ordinary NNS , via their taxes , to a fabulously rich family that on such occasions appears not very modern , at all ; in fact , it all feels rather feudal , "" VBD Patrick Basham , the founding director of the Democracy Institute , a Washington - and London - VBN libertarian NN tank . He told VOA : "" A royal family savvier about the optics MD have refused , for example , taxpayers footing the vast security bill . Instead , wedding sponsorship MD have been procured from the British fashion , music and tourism industries , which MD serve to VB taxpayers off the hook — a huge PR win — and provide significant JJ branding opportunities for leading domestic NNS and entrepreneurs .

There ’s a marathon for everyone — from NNS who just VBP to have a good NN to those seeking an obstacle course . And do n't forget those who are checking races off their bucket lists . These JJ - distance runs are so expensive , NN - consuming , and in - demand that NNS are spending NN on races either for the prestige and the advertising of a permanent corporate sponsorship , or just to VB a simple , lucrative return on investment . But just what are the economics behind marathons ? And where does all that NN VB ? Read on to find out more about the costs associated with these races . The Dollars and Cents of Running a Marathon Marathons are a relatively inelastic good , so RB if the cost to participate goes up , NNS still take part . And they 're normally willing to shell out a lot of cash for the experience . Some of the elite races charge participants different fees from selection lotteries to registration costs . And these charges can be quite hefty . The bigger the race , the bigger the cost . Let 's look at the NNP York City Marathon — CD of the NN 's most coveted races . Prospective participants have to meet certain eligibility criteria before they can be guaranteed entry . The organization holds a selection lottery just for a chance to participate in the actual marathon . Then there 's the registration fee , which depends on your status . U.S. residents who are members of the NNP York Road Runners group pay a $ 255 registration fee . That fee increases to $ 295 for residents who are nonmembers , and to $ 358 for non-U.S. residents .﻿﻿ The costs of putting on a marathon begin to accumulate months before the race actually happens . RB , the organizer has to examine a map and decide where to hold the race . Armed with a meticulously planned - out route , the organizer needs to VB the necessary permits from the city and permission to VB quasi-public spaces and any private property IN parking lots . Once the permits are secure , the organizer needs to consult a USA Track & Field Road Course Certifier about having the distance certified .﻿﻿ After all , no NN wants to be that NN who holds a 25 - mile marathon by mistake . The road course certifier charges a small fee for these services . Finally , it ’s NN to start getting the word out to the NN . Advertising costs can drop dramatically if JJ NN picks up the race . But RB still , organizers will still have to budget for radio , print , and JJ ad NN . Race day is the most expensive part of a marathon . Not only does the course need to be set up with NN tables , food tables , and portable toilets , it all needs to be done by NNS . If no NN volunteers , the event organizer needs to hire and pay its staff for the day . Staffing expenses come on top of the cost of having an on - NN JJ NN in NN of an emergency . This is an important requirement set forth by the insurance policy the race organizer will RB need to buy . And let 's not forget the immense cost of security to ensure crowd NN . According to a Philadelphia half - marathon , the cost to secure a half - marathon with a simple police presence can range between $ 30,000 and $ 120,000 .﻿﻿ The racers who have paid a hefty registration fee to run are RB an expensive part of the race . According to the Washington Post , participation t- shirts , bibs , pins , goodie bags , and medals cost the Marine Corps Marathon about $ 13 IN NN in 2013 .﻿﻿ Smaller races MD have a higher cost IN NN as they can’t benefit as much from economies of scale . Race timing systems are perhaps the biggest hidden cost to the racers . RB consisting of a cheap radio frequency identification ( RFID ) attached to a race bib , a timing NN can cost thousands . Hiring a NN to NN a smaller event can be cheaper in the short term , with machine and chip rentals costing a few dollars IN runner .﻿﻿ The biggest source of revenue for marathons is the entry participation fee . For races organized as charitable fundraisers , high registration fees are n’t a JJ concern as the runner knows that any excess will VB to VB fight breast cancer or to build a JJ school track field . Races run in the name of a charity can attract JJ sponsors who VBP to give back to the community and benefit from supporting a good NN . The Washington Post broke down the cost of hosting a marathon and VBD that for every $ 99 a runner paid to participate , sponsors contributed $ 58 .﻿ ﻿ Corporations are incentivized to organize running events and prestigious marathons because of their popularity . As with all goods , the more popular and in - demand it is , the more an organization can charge . Realistically , the Boston Marathon , London Marathon , and NNP York City Marathon MD double their prices , and although there MD be an outrage , their limited good ( racing spots ) MD be filled by NNS who value the experience enough to pay the inflated costs . Some of the NN 's biggest marathons attract NNS from all over the NN . That means JJ bucks for local economies . For example , roughly 30 % of the drawing applicants accepted to run in the 2020 NNP York City Marathon were international runners .﻿﻿ Runners who come from outside the hosting metropolitan area inject a lot of NN into hotels , food , and entertainment . All of this is true for other less prestigious but uber - popular races . Some popular examples include the Rock n Roll Marathon and Walt Disney ’s ( DIS ) Walt Disney NNP Marathon , as well as Color Me Rad , Tough Mudder , and other running events . Races that belong to the latter category RB have the JJ benefit of being untimed , which leads to more NN for the organizer as well as the city itself . While modern marathon racing is more than a NN JJ , the participation numbers have increased wildly in the past decade . As more NNS embrace the healthy benefits of running , along with its low - cost and minimal barriers to entry , marathon organizers are shaping up to VB their numbers continue to grow each NN ."

But let 's VB that , somehow , you were to fall out of an airplane and VBD yourself in that exact situation . You have to keep that you have to VB fast . If you fall out at 12,000 NNS ( about 2 NNS up ) , you only have about 60 seconds before you hit the ground . In free fall , you fall at about 125 NNS IN hour ( mph ) if you have your arms and legs extended , and at that speed you will travel about 12,000 NNS in CD minute . The JJ thing to do is to look for a NN of NN . If you can dive into NN , it wo n't feel good at 125 mph , but you 'll survive if the NN is deep enough -- at least 12 NNS or so . Steer toward the NN ( it 's helpful if you 've been skydiving before and VBP how to steer as you are falling ) , and dive RB in . If there 's no NN RB , then you need to try something else . CD NN in NNP NNP II survived a jump without a parachute from about 18,000 NNS . He fell through the branches in a pine thicket and landed in deep NN . So you might try looking for some trees and hope for the best . Lacking NN or trees -- for example , you 're falling in an urban area and can't spot a rooftop pool -- your next option is to look for something JJ with the hope that it will break your fall . For example , landing on the roof of an RV , a mobile home or a truck 's trailer is a possibility . These structures are not extremely strong . When you hit them , they 'll break and absorb some of the NN of the fall . Whether it will be enough NN or not is an open question . There 's only CD NN to find out , but we do n't recommend you try it ! And while we do VB to do our own research and take things apart here at HowStuffWorks , you have to draw the line somewhere .

The Congolese conceded both goals at set pieces — RB from a corner and then a free kick as Patrick Kaddu and Emmanuel Okwi scored in Uganda ’s JJ win at the finals for more than 40 NNS . It has since emerged that the Congolese had to cancel their last training session on the eve of Saturday ’s NN because squad members were forced to undertake JJ checks at a Cairo hospital as the NN ’s NN federation had not supplied the required NN certificates to tournament organisers .

From a pesky NN NN to more serious NNS IN numbness , your NNS often show NNS of NN before any other part of your NN . No hair on your NNS or NNS “ Bald ” NNS can be a sign of poor circulation as a result of vascular NN . What can you do ? Although the hair MD never return ( which is n’t necessarily a terrible thing ! ) , you ’ll VB to VB a NN about improving your circulation and getting your vascular NN in check . If you have a wound on your NN that just wo n’t heal , you MD be at NN for diabetes . Elevated NN glucose levels over NN can lead to nerve damage in the NNS , and so you MD not feel an ulcer on your the bottom of your NN . Left untreated , this can lead to serious consequences , RB to amputation . For NNS , cold NNS MD indicate an “ underfunctioning ” thyroid problem , which is the gland that regulates temperature and metabolism . Poor circulation is another possible NN for both NNS and NNS . The solution : Aside from potential thyroid medications , there ’s not much you can do other than bundle up your NNS in thick wool socks and slippers to keep warm . If CD or more of your toenails starts to thicken , VB color , and separate from the NN , it probably means you have a fungal infection living beneath the toenail . NNS with diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis , and other immune deficiencies MD be more susceptible than others in contracting toenail fungus . The solution : VB a podiatrist or internist for care and NN . If your JJ NN suddenly blows up , you MD be experiencing gout . This medieval sounding NN is actually a form of arthritis and is caused by the build up of the natural substance , uric acid . Why the JJ NN ? The excess uric acid forms in the NN part with the lowest temperature , which just happens to be your JJ NN . Having a persistent “ pins and needles ” feeling in your NNS , or actual loss of feeling , can be a sign of peripheral neuropathy . Peripheral neuropathy means there ’s been some damage to your peripheral nervous NN and can be caused by several things , but the most common are diabetes and alcohol abuse . The solution : VB your NN and explain your NNS . The NN condition psoriasis can RB manifest itself in your toenails . Affecting up to half of those living with psoriasis MD find their toenails ( and fingernails ) to have JJ tiny holes . NNS with the related joint condition , psoriatic arthritis , RB MD experience this issue . The solution : There are currently several medications on the NN to treat the NNS associated with psoriasis and psoriatic psoriasis . A shooting NN in your heel MD be a sign of plantar fasciitis , which means the band of connective tissue running along the bottom of your NN is inflamed . The NN is RB concentrated in the heel and gets worse throughout the day . The solution : If you have persistant NN , VB a podiatrist and avoid high heeled NNS . Sunken toenails MD be a sign of anemia . Anemia often shows up in toenails with as concave or spoonlike indentations in the NNS ’ nail beds , and is most prevalent in moderate - to - severe NNS . To be sure , your NN will VB to do a complete NN count . Sudden , CD - off instances of NN cramping MD just mean you ’re dehydrated or exercising too hard , but if you have chronic NN cramping , you MD be lacking calcium , potassium , or magnesium in your diet . If you experience frequent cramping , try stretching your NNS before bed and eating more calcium - rich foods . Sore NN joints MD be a sign of the degenerative joint NN , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . RA typically attacks smaller joints RB – IN joints in the wrist and NNS , so pay attention if you have a persistent achy feeling or swelling . The inability to raise the NN upward from the heel is called “ drop NN . ” This MD be the result of nerve damage or trauma in your neck , back , or leg . If you experience this , you should contact your NN immediately , since this can be reversed or permanent , depending on what caused it and how it ’s treated . Dry , flaky NN on the NNS MD be a sign of athlete ’s NN , which is a fungal infection . Athlete ’s NN RB shows up between the JJ CD NNS and RB starts as dry , itchy NN that then progresses to inflammation and blisters . If you suspect you have athlete ’s NN , be sure to keep your NNS clean and dry . NNS that show a variation of color – from white , to blue , to red – MD be experiencing a symptom of Raynaud ’s NN . The colors appear as the vessels spasm . If you experience this , VB a NN to VB sure there is n’t an underlying condition ."

That ’s at least according to the Wednesday morning assessment of Tom Biscardi ’s NNP Project Investments Inc by FactSet , a NN provider that tracks publicly traded NNS . Biscardi ’s NN had , at that NN , a NN capitalization of more than $ 10 CD . “ I gotta tell you something , I nearly s — . ” That ’s Biscardi describing his JJ NNP encounter to CNBC . He VBZ he ’s personally seen the cryptid seven times in 45 NNS , starting in Northern California in 1973 . Biscardi ’s initial encounter sparked a series of videos and a NN that refers to him , perhaps inaccurately ( medically speaking , at least ) as “ the Godfather of NNP . ” Biscardi ’s NN ( stock ticker : BGFT ) was registered in 2013 with the Securities and Exchange Commission . It ’s currently what ’s VBN as a “ pink sheets firm , ” which means it ’s in the same category as penny stocks , shell corporations and other less - than - savory investments . In filings with the SEC , BGFT VBZ its stock became eligible for trading on June 28 . This week , the current share price was $ 50.01 , which , with number of shares in the NN outstanding ( 200 CD ) , created the $ 10 CD figure . The thing is , no NN understands where that $ 50.01 figure came from , because , as CNBC reports , BGFT ’s current assets are “ $ 221 in cash along with 73 original casts of NNP footprints , a 109 - inch skeleton and a rubber suit from a 2008 NNP hoax . ” ( Filings RB note that NNP is VBN by 15 names across the NN , such as “ Yeti ” in Tibet , “ Yowie ” in NNP and “ Hibagon ” in Japan .

We VBP it was AA Flight 77 because of this convenient piece of “ wreckage ” recovered at the NN : CD of our sources sent over a NN , purportedly from a Pentagon security camera facing the impact NN . The frame paused at 5 seconds appears to show a fast - moving projectile slamming into CD side of the Pentagon from the NN . This object has no wings whatsoever . The logical conclusion is that the object is a missile . After the impact , a fireball quickly becomes thick , gray smoke . At 1:49 the NN cuts to some live - action footage of the Pentagon . This footage was shot from a position opposite from the JJ NN , but still facing the point of impact . However , the JJ NNS on the scene who were n’t JJ responders ( police , firefighters , medics ) VBD no evidence that a plane actually struck the Pentagon . The wreckage did not VB “ forensic sense , ” and raised questions immediately from objective witnesses . The female CNN reporter begins this NN by saying that a certain “ Bob Franken and an eyewitness ” had concluded that the plane landed “ short of the Pentagon ” – meaning it never made it that far . The entire CNN breaking NN segment , which includes the above NN content , is shown in another NNP NN . CNN ’s JJ affairs correspondent Jaime McIntyre VBD no plane RB fell short of the mark . After walking up to the smoldering Pentagon , he observed : “ From my close - up inspection , there ’s no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon … The only pieces left …are small enough to pick up in your hand . There are no JJ tail sections , wing sections , fuselage – nothing IN that anywhere RB which MD indicate that the entire plane crashed into the side of the Pentagon and then caused the side to collapse . ” The demolished Pentagon floors did n’t collapse until 45 minutes after impact , and the burn marks were inconsistent with those seen at the WTC Twin Towers in NYC – RB allegedly toppled by mere airplanes . By the NN , in terms of construction physics , the heat generated by the amount of jet fuel on a plane ( VBN on fuel tank capacity , rate of consumption , and NN from take - off ) is not hot enough to “ melt steel , ” as the mainstream NN repeated ad nauseum . The damage seen at the Pentagon crash NN is more consistent with that of a plane crash – but was there RB a plane ? JJ investigators VBP the answer is no . This NN analyzes the damage done to the Pentagon . The affected area measured about 65 NNS wide and 73 NNS tall – the height of the building . The narrator informs : “ From wingtip to wingtip , a 757 is 124 NNS , 10 inches . From nose to tail a 757 is 155 NNS 3 inches in length , and the height is 44 NNS 6 inches . How does a plane of those dimensions [ size ] fit into a hole only 65 NNS across ? ” Just to recap , we have JJ - hand reports that no significant plane wreckage was VBN at the Pentagon explosion NN and the hole was too small to have been made by a 757 jet airplane . Both reports were buried while the mainstream NN continued to bleat the cover story in order to launch the unending “ NN on Terror ” under which we are currently oppressed . Is there more evidence to weigh ? Try this on for size . This NN reported that NO CD DIED RB after this alleged jet crashed into a busy office building during working hours . Just how is that supposed to happen , given the physical forces involved ? Were the NNS shown being transported on stretchers actually paid , professional NN actors ? Apparently , Bush , Cheney , and the other NWO leaders in charge of the US believed – and still VBP – that We the NNS are dumb as stumps . We swallowed their incredibly evil lies and let them take away our civil rights under the oxymoronic Patriot Act . Most NNS – or “ sheeple ” – who are either too busy or just not interested do VB that giving up our cherished freedoms is “ the price we must pay ” to ensure “ national security . ” Occasionally , though , someone important admits the NN . In this short NN snippet from an interview with Neil Degrasse Tyson , JJ NNP Bill NNP mentions the “ Pentagon bomb . ” Although lifted from its original context , NNP seems to be answering a question about 9/11 being an inside job that was discussed by the US presidential candidates during the debates – before anything happened on 9/11 . A slip of the tongue ? A guilty conscience ? A mistake made while tired ? You decide . Now , consider this eye - witness testimony . A woman alleging to be a Pentagon employee inside the building during the explosion on 9/11 made this NN . At 2:19 , she VBZ : “ As I was coming out of the Pentagon I did n’t VB any evidence of metal , airplane seats , luggage – nothing that MD give me any indication that it was a plane that had hit the building . ” No NN she encountered had any jet fuel on their bodies , and no NN in her area . This concerned citizen ’s call to action is to open a federal grand jury to decide if We the NNS are the victims of highest - level perjury and obstruction of justice . The “ official story ” is BUNK , plain and simple . Stop the fictional “ NN on Terror ” forced on a nation still reeling from shock . Dismantle the pork - belly , boondoggle organizations thereby created , notably DHS and TSA . Refocus the national narrative on the NN , and for pete ’s sake , stop patronizing us . We taxpayers funded the ridiculous “ 9/11 Commission Report ” which concluded that the guilty party was – are you ready for this ? – the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) . RB 9/11 Commissioner Tim Roemer spilled the beans when he told CNN , thinking back about the Pentagon attack : “ You were worried , especially when I was standing in front of the Pentagon that night , seeing CD of our fortresses pried open by a missile – uh , airplane . ” Have n’t you had enough lies ?"

""_`` ROV_NNP captures_VBZ first_RB -_HYPH ever_RB footage_NN of_IN oarfish_NN in_IN the_DT wild_NN ""_'' ._. grindtv.com_NNP /._NFP","Oarfish are JJ , greatly elongated , pelagic lampriform fish belonging to the small family Regalecidae . [ 1 ] VBN in all temperate to tropical oceans yet rarely seen , the oarfish family contains three NNS in CD genera . CD of these , the JJ oarfish ( Regalecus glesne ) , is the longest bony fish alive , growing up to 8 m ( 26 ft ) in length . The common name oarfish is thought to be in reference either to their highly compressed and elongated bodies , or to the now discredited belief that the fish "" row "" themselves through the NN with their pelvic fins . [ 2 ] The family name Regalecidae is derived from the Latin regalis , meaning "" royal "" . The occasional beachings of oarfish after storms , and their habit of lingering at the NN when sick or dying , VB oarfish a probable source of JJ sea serpent tales . Although the larger NNS are considered NN fish and are fished commercially to a minor extent , oarfish are rarely caught alive ; their flesh is not well regarded for eating due to its gelatinous consistency . [ 3 ] The dorsal fin originates from above the ( relatively JJ ) eyes and runs the entire length of the fish . Of the approximately 400 dorsal fin rays , the JJ 10 to 13 are elongated to varying degrees , forming a trailing crest embellished with reddish spots and flaps of NN at the ray tips . The pelvic fins are similarly elongated and adorned , reduced to CD to five rays each . The pectoral fins are greatly reduced and situated low on the NN . The anal fin is completely absent and the caudal fin MD be reduced or absent , as well , with the NN tapering to a fine point . All fins lack true spines . At least CD account , from NNS in NNP Zealand , described the oarfish as giving off "" electric shocks "" when touched . [ 2 ] IN other members of its order , the oarfish has a small yet highly protrusible oblique mouth with no visible teeth . The NN is scaleless and the NN is covered with easily abraded , silvery guanine . In the streamer fish ( Agrostichthys parkeri ) , the NN is clad with hard tubercles . All NNS lack NN bladders and the number of gill rakers is variable . Oarfish coloration is RB variable ; the flanks are commonly covered with irregular bluish to blackish streaks , black dots , and squiggles . These markings quickly fade following death . The JJ oarfish is by far the largest member of the family at a published total length of 8 m ( 26 ft ) — with unconfirmed reports of 11 m ( 36 ft ) and 17 m ( 56 ft ) [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] specimens — and 270 kg ( 600 lb ) in weight . [ 7 ] The streamer fish is VBN to reach 3 m ( 10 ft ) in length , [ 8 ] while the largest recorded specimen of Regalecus russelii measured 5.4 m ( 18 ft ) . [ 9 ] Oarfish have the longest VBN length of any living NNS of bony fish . [ 10 ] The oarfish is thought to inhabit the epipelagic to mesopelagic ocean layers , ranging from 200 meters ( 660 ft ) to 1,000 meters ( 3,300 ft ) and is rarely seen on the NN . A few have been VBN still barely alive , but RB if PRP floats to the NN , it dies . At the depths the oarfish live , there are few or no currents . As a result , they build little muscle mass and they cannot survive in shallower turbulent NN . [ 11 ] The members of the family are VBN to have a worldwide range . However , JJ encounters with live oarfish are rare , and distribution information is collated from records of oarfish caught or washed ashore . [ 2 ] Oarfish were RB described in 1772 . [ 12 ] Rare encounters with divers and accidental catches have supplied what little is VBN of oarfish ethology ( behavior ) and ecology . Oarfish are solitary NNS and MD frequent significant depths up to 1,000 m ( 3,300 ft ) . An oarfish measuring 3.3 m ( 11 ft ) and 63.5 kg ( 140 lb ) was reported to have been caught in February 2003 using a fishing rod baited with squid at Skinningrove , NNP Kingdom . [ 13 ] A photograph on display in bars , restaurants , guesthouses and markets IN Laos and Thailand captioned "" Queen of Nāgas seized by the NNP Army at Mekhong River , Laos NNP Base , on June 27 , 1973 , with the length of 7.80 metres [ 25.6 ft ] "" is , as far as the caption goes , a hoax . The photograph itself is real , however , and was taken by Dr. Leo Smith of the Field Museum , of an oarfish VBN in September 1996 by NNP NNPS Navy SEAL trainees on the coast of Coronado , California , USA . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] In 2001 , an oarfish was filmed alive in situ : the 1.5 - metre ( 4.9 - NN ) fish was spotted by a group of U.S. Navy personnel during the inspection of a buoy in the Bahamas . [ 16 ] The oarfish was observed to propel itself by an amiiform mode of swimming ; that is , rhythmically undulating the dorsal fin while keeping the NN itself straight . Perhaps indicating a feeding posture , oarfish have been observed swimming in a vertical orientation , with their JJ axis perpendicular to the ocean NN . In this posture , the downstreaming light MD silhouette the oarfishes ' prey , making them easier to spot . In July 2008 , NNS captured footage of the rare fish swimming in its natural habitat in the mesopelagic zone in the Gulf of Mexico . It is the JJ ever confirmed sighting of an oarfish at depth , as most specimens are discovered dying at the sea NN or washed ashore . The fish was estimated to be between five and ten metres ( 16 and 33 ft ) in length . [ 17 ] As part of the SERPENT Project , five observations of apparently healthy oarfish Regalecus glesne by remotely operated vehicles were reported from the northern Gulf of Mexico between 2008 and 2011 at depths within the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones . [ 18 ] These observations include the deepest verified record of R. glesne ( 463–492 m or 1,519 –1,614 ft ) . [ CD ] From December 2009 to March 2010 , unusual numbers of the slender oarfish Regalecus russelii [ 9 ] ( 竜宮の使い “ Ryūgū - No - Tsukai ” , ) VBN in Japanese folklore as the Messenger from the Sea NNP 's Palace , appeared in the waters and on the beaches of Japan , the appearance of which is VBN to portend earthquakes . [ 20 ] After the 2011 Fukushima earthquake and tsunami which killed over 20,000 NNS , JJ pointed to the oarfish from 2009 – ⁠2010 to build up this myth . [ 21 ] In CD , NNP NNP aired an episode of the television series River Monsters named "" Deep Sea Demon "" in which Jeremy Wade was filmed during an encounter with a live oarfish while diving . The oarfish at this location seemed to be using a buoy anchor chain as a guide to ascend to the NN . On his second diving attempt , he was able to VB CD live oarfish as they ascended relatively close to the NN . This is the only VBN footage of JJ interaction with a healthy oarfish in its own environment . Wade was RB able to touch CD of the oarfish with his hand . The oarfish were propelling themselves by an amiiform mode of swimming as noted by other sightings . [ 22 ] In January 2019 CD oarfish were VBN alive in the nets of fisherman on the Japanese island of Okinawa . [ 21 ] Oarfish feed primarily on zooplankton , selectively straining tiny euphausiids , shrimp , and other crustaceans from the NN . Small fish , jellyfish , and squid are RB taken . JJ open - ocean carnivores are all likely predators of oarfish . The oceanodromous Regalecus glesne is recorded as spawning off Mexico from July to December ; all NNS are presumed to not guard their eggs , and release brightly coloured , buoyant eggs , up to six millimetres ( 0.24 in ) across , which are incorporated into the zooplankton . The eggs hatch after about three weeks into highly active larvae that feed on other zooplankton . The larvae have little resemblance to the adults , with JJ dorsal and pelvic fins and extensible mouths . [ 2 ] Larvae and juveniles have been observed drifting just below the NN . In contrast , adult oarfish are rarely seen at the NN when not sick or injured . • Fishes : An Introduction to ichthyology . Peter B. Moyle and Joseph J. Cech , Jr ; p. 338 . Printed in 2004 .

These_DT links_NNS will_MD help_VB you_PRP learn_VB more_JJR :_:","­ It is amazing , but the total amount of gold in the NN is a surprisingly small q­uantity . Here 's how you can calculate the total amount that is available . If you look at a page IN this NN , or if you look it up in an encyclopedia , you will find that the annual worldwide production of gold is something IN 50 CD troy ounces IN NN . Gold has a specific gravity of 19.3 , meaning that it is 19.3 times heavier than NN . So gold weighs 19.3 kilograms IN liter . A liter is a cube that measures 10 centimeters ( about 4 inches ) on a side . There are 32.15 troy ounces in a kilogram . Therefore , the NN produces a cube of gold that is about 4.3 meters ( about 14 NNS ) on each side every NN . In other words , all of the gold produced worldwide in CD NN MD just about fit in the average NN 's living room ! This cube weighs 1,555,210 kilograms ( 3,110,420 pounds ) . A recent spot price for gold was $ 256.10 U.S. -- using that number , all of the gold produced in a NN is worth $ 12,805,000,000 . That 's a lot of NN , but not an unimaginable amount . For example , that 's about how much the Pentagon spent launching the GPS satellite NN . NNP 's budget in 1998 was $ 13.6 CD . Figuring out the total amount of gold that has been produced by NN is a little harder . To VB at some kind of estimate , let 's figure that the NN has been producing gold at 50 CD ounces a NN for 200 NNS . That number is probably a little high , but when you figure that the Aztecs and the Egyptians produced a fair amount of gold for a JJ NN , it 's probably not too far off . Fifty CD ounces * 200 NNS = 10 CD ounces . Ten CD ounces of gold MD fit into a cube roughly 25 meters ( about 82 NNS ) on a side . Consider that the Washington Monument measures 55 NNS by 55 NNS at its base and is 555 NNS tall ( 17 x 17 x 170 m ) . That means that if you MD somehow gather every scrap of gold that NN has ever mined into CD place , you MD only build about CD - third of the Washington Monument . Platinum is RB more scarce than gold . Only 3.6 CD troy ounces are produced IN NN . Its specific gravity is 21.45 , and it was discovered in the 18th NN , not in 3,000 B.C. If you assume that the NN has produced 3.6 CD ounces IN NN for 50 NNS to estimate the total worldwide supply , all of the platinum in the NN MD fit in a cube that is 6.3 meters ( about 20 NNS ) on a side . In other words , all of the platinum in the entire NN MD easily fit in the average home ! These links will VB you learn more :"

Let s begin having a look at some modern propaganda techniques . On CD separate occasions , someone mentioned something to me about terrorism , or the NN on terror , and I responded by asking "" you do VB that there is indisputable scientific evidence that proves beyond any doubt that the Twin Towers were demolished with explosives , JJ ? "" For me , any discussion of terrorism has to begin with the understanding of what actually happened on 9 - 11 , rather than what we were told to VB . On both occasions , the NN I was talking to responded by saying "" I heard that the NN of Mexico saw a UFO . "" The JJ NN this happened , I shook my head and thought to myself "" what the hell is this girl thinking ? Maybe the NN of Mexico sniffs glue and sees all kinds of things , but what does CD thing have to do with the other ? How did she VB the jump from 9 - 11 to Mexican UFOs without a sentence between the CD subjects ? The second NN it happened I thought to myself "" Holy shit . This is a conditioned response . "" Somehow , the herd has been taught to immediately VB an association with UFOs , NNP , or the ghost of Elvis whenever someone talks to them about crimes committed by NNS within our NN . This is incredibly convenient for a NN comprised of crooks and perverts , but how did they accomplish this ? If you take a look at a typical "" NN NN "" , youll VB all kinds of revelations about the 9 - 11 attacks , the FEMA concentration camps , and possibly the latest information on that shadowy and elusive group VBN only as "" The NNP NNP Order , "" and youll RB VB the latest crop circle designs , the most recent UFO photos , the image of Christ in an NN cube , a JJ - hand account from the NN who wrestled NNP , the true location of the sunken city of Atlantis , and all manner of non-sense designed to VB any important information appear ridiculous by this association . The Daily Globe is CD of CD newspapers I m aware of that exists for this same purpose . This is CD of the thin papers that RB sports a headline involving 800 - pound Siamese twins suing each other for and against surgical separation , or the poor NN whose wife was mysteriously transformed into a hammer - head shark . Because everyone knows that these newspapers epitomize incredulity , they re the perfect place to print any information that needs to be immediately discredited . "" ALIEN ABDUCTEE VBZ U.S. GOVT BEHIND 9 - 11 ATTACKS "" MD be a probable headline . VB how this works ? You dont have to buy the paper . Nobody does . A few copies are prominently displayed near every supermarket checkout line , and this is what NNS remember when someone tries to warn them that the NN of this nation has gotten completely out of NN . Their mind makes an association between the important information , and the ridiculous information , and they feel confident that its nothing they need to worry about , but they MD carry on the silly conversation about UFOs and stuff just to be polite . Silently they re convinced that because you tried to warn them about their criminal NN , you must RB spend your nights on the roof searching the skies for E.T . Theres RB no shortage of TV and movie characters who openly insist that our NN is involved in all kinds of heinous activity , but every last CD of them is a lunatic . Cosmo Kramer is a recent example . He promotes alternative medicine , doesnt trust the NN , and besides that , hes completely off the wall . Not the type of lunatic you MD fear , but hes definitely not someone you MD look to for reliable information , or RB sane discourse . Look closely at every TV character who questions or mistrusts the NN , and you will VB that this behavior is linked with CD abnormal personality after another . The sub -conscious lesson here is that anyone who questions the NN or suggests they MD be involved in any crime has an abnormal personality , so you can quickly dismiss everything he has to VB . Through decades of repetition of these messages , youve been taught to ignore any criminality on the part of anyone in our NN , and anyone who might VB such an accusation . While you were being so trained , you were robbed of your wealth and freedom . There are NNS commonly referred to as "" NN theorists "" . In reality , absolutely no NN hangs RB theorizing about conspiracies , but this label is applied to anyone who feels a civic duty to warn other Americans of criminal activity within their NN . The "" NN theorist "" is a character that only exists on television and in movies , and this character , who is always a lunatic , was created for you to VB an association with when someone tries to warn you about NN crimes . The result is that when someone tries to explain to you that your own NN is doing all it can to either kill or enslave you , he MD as well be crying to you about his wife turning into a shark during his most recent UFO abduction , regardless of any proof he has . For most Americans , the NNS on TV have replaced their normal JJ society , and the exchange of ideas they MD have once had with neighbors and others in their community is now fed to them via the almighty tube . They are fed CD sides of a debate , allowed to choose between them , and this choice allows them to feel a bond with other NNS of CD opinion or the other , and lets them feel IN they re wise enough to have an opinion in the matter , and free enough to express it . The reality here is that neither side of the debate ever contains the entire NN of the matter , but just enough information , or misinformation , to VB them feel they re informed , and give them something to enter a futile debate with , if they did actually talk to their neighbor . Political correctness silenced the rest of them by teaching a reluctance to saying or hearing anything controversial or possibly disturbing . What Americans are shown on TV are allegedly the NNS of various independent broadcasting NNS who compete for viewers who will supposedly watch the commercial messages that are injected into the entertainment , but if this is the NN , why the incredible similarity between the allegedly competing NNS ? Wouldnt you VBP that eventually CD network or Hollywood studio might experiment with a sane and respectable character who doesnt trust the NN ? Are there any other typified characters that exist on all networks ? As it happens , there are JJ . Just to name a few ; every father is an idiot , as is every private citizen who owns a firearm , every mother is an over - worked and under - appreciated slave , everyone who works for the NN is a hero who endlessly risks his NN for your protection , and everyone who sells drugs is black or hispanic . Every Arab is a screaming madman , and every Jew is kind , gentle and wise . Every homosexual is moral , kind , and intelligent , and everyone who lives in a rural area of the NN is an idiot . I dont need to VB on . You can probably name a few of your own , but the important point here is that the same personality traits transcend all characters on all networks . This is obviously no accident . If we can VB common themes and messages that are being foisted upon the NN by all networks , it proves that either there is no real competition between them and they all share a common political goal , or that all of their programing is being influenced or dictated by an outside entity , or both . Nothing else can explain the incredible similarity of stereotyped personality traits in all these fictional characters . Now the next logical step MD be to recognize and list as JJ of these common themes as possible , and VB if they all serve a particular political agenda . Just by skimming the NN we VBP an effort to thwart private gun ownership , discourage masculinity , encourage homosexuality , promote NNS to "" head of household "" status , and foster hatred against all Arabs . Then there are the constant attacks on that "" antiquated document "" VBN as the Bill of Rights , which permeate every episode of "" Law and Order "" and "" CSI "" ** ( if not for that silly forth amendment , all those mangled NNS MD be alive , kind of thing ) . Whose interests does this propaganda serve ? Who benefits by trying to VB JJ opinion in this direction ? Certainly not the TV viewer , because as well VB in the next episode of our action - packed adventure through main - stream NN propaganda , the TV viewers been taught to work against his own self - interests .

You MD reach this milestone much earlier if you 've led a NN - active lifestyle . By age 50 , you MD have lost nearly half of the fatty padding on the soles of your NNS . And you MD be wearing a shoe that 's a size bigger than what you wore in your 20s , in part because of weight gain that puts greater pres-sure on your NNS , and in part because your ligaments and tendons have lost some of their elasticity ( which RB predisposes them to potentially painful ruptures or microtears ) . If you 've given birth , you have another reason for the increase in shoe size : hormones released during pregnancy RB VBP ligaments to relax . Menopause , too , can affect NN NN . Unless countered by medications or exercise , the loss of estrogen and other hormonal changes generally lead to lower bone density , resulting in osteoporosis if enough bone mass is lost . This condition can raise the NN of stress fractures ( hairline breaks ) in any of the bones of the NN . Unless treated appropriately , stress fractures can worsen and VB the bones to shift out of place .

Following an eight - strong group of teen soldiers and their adult prisoner of NN , it is sensual , and gorgeous and intensely , continuously disturbing . The kids – Dog , Lady , NNP , Boom - Boom , Rambo , Swede , Wolf , Smurf – are left to their own devices except for the occasional visit from “ the Messenger ” , who works for whatever organisation has recruited them . So they scrap and kiss and fire their AK - 47s into the sky . Alejandro Landes , the NN ’s 39 - NN - JJ director , VBZ it does n’t matter who they ’re fighting for . “ Colombia ’s been NN - torn for so JJ decades . I ’ve seen that violence happen from the left and I ’ve seen it happen from the NN . My grandfather ’s favourite place in the NN , his farm that he worked all his NN to buy , became the headquarters for the most gruesome rightwing paramilitary group , the AUC , and I ’ve had part of my family kidnapped by guerrillas . ” Who , exactly ? “ My grandfather ’s sister , my cousin … things IN that . ” Were they freed ? “ Some yes , some no . So that is something that I had seen and experienced . ” These experiences inspired and informed Monos . We ’re given no specifics of NN and place – it ’s somewhere in Latin NNP . Landes , who lives in NNP York , has Colombian roots but grew up in Ecuador , his NNS having left Medellín in the 1980s to escape the violence . To find his actors , he and his producers sifted through 800 tapes , selecting 25 possibles totake part in a mock training camp for four weeks in the Andes . Most had never acted before , though there was CD major exception : Moisés Arias ( NNP ) was a regular in Miley Cyrus ’s Disney series Hannah Montana . CD they saw on a tape playing basketball , a kid with a close crop , referred to on the NN as Matt , but in fact named Sofia ( Buenaventura ) . She plays Rambo in the NN and , VBZ Landes , “ was very inspirational for the fluidity of the character ” . He calls the character , who is written as male , “ post - gender ” . Researching the NN , Landes visited Colombian reinsertion camps , meeting adult rebel fighters who had laid down their guns and wanted to enter civil society . In CD he VBD Wilson Salazar , a NN with dwarfism who became a child soldier at 11 and deserted when he was 24 . There was a sizeable price on his head , dead or alive . “ He was very good at what he did , ” VBZ Landes . “ He had risen to be part of a column called Teófilo Forero , CD of the most feared combat units . He was an amazing destroyer of things . ” Landes hired Salazar as a JJ consultant , then asked him to play the Messenger , too , as he was so convincing . At the camp , Salazar woke his JJ charges at 4 am each day . They ’d undertake acting exercises in the mornings , and in the afternoons Salazar MD give them clandestine JJ training . “ It was intense , ” VBZ Landes . “ It was a boot - camp scenario – the kids were living , sleeping , eating together , everything together , all at the same NN . ” Landes then selected his eight , tweaking the screenplay to fit . The shoot was yet more full - on . The opening mountaintop segment was shot at almost 14,000 ft ( 4,300 m ) : punishingly cold and wet . “ You move slower up there , ” VBZ Landes . “ There ’s low oxygen , you move in a bit of a daze . ” On the JJ day , someone from the camera department had an epileptic seizure . A baptism by fire , thought Landes ; things will VB easier . They did not . For four weeks , the 55 - strong cast and crew filmed in the jungle IN the Samaná river , five hours RB - east of Medellín . Mules carried their food ; Colombia ’s national kayak NN helped with filming on the rapids ; a family of local gold miners built their JJ tents . There was no electricity , no running NN , no refrigerated food and torrential downpours all night every night . There were food rations . The shoot took its toll . “ NNS were dropping IN flies , including me , ” VBZ Landes . “ Everyone had their day . Everyone cried on this movie . You ’re working six - day weeks , very high - intensity scenarios . ” Landes himself was working seven - day weeks . CD morning he woke up and MD n’t move . The gold miners put him on a stretcher and carried him up a canyon until they reached a local JJ centre . He cried on the journey , distraught that the production might collapse . He was back behind the camera 20 hours later . “ I VBP it was just the stress , ” he VBZ . “ And the ration diet . ” It was worth it . The NN has earned universal raves – and a special prize in San Sebastián NN festival , Spain , for accurately reflecting “ the values and reality ” of LGBTQ NNS . The story is a nightmare in which nothing – gender , sexuality , political allegiance – is muddled or irrelevant . “ It ’s not binary . That ’s why I VBP it reaches much further than Colombia . That is what ’s most timely and relevant . I wanted to VB sure that the NN spoke not to the moment but to us as a NN . ” • Monos is released in the UK on 25 October"

The respective ‘ army ’ of NN soldiers is now revealed as ‘ Contact Tracers ’ who will kickstart the national panopticon grid of total surveillance . The specific marketing propaganda to implement this is that it “ will VB us emerge from lockdown . ” You VBP to emerge from lockdown , do n’t you ? This subtle lever of coercion is to ensure JJ acceptance . Since each NN is responsible for their own surveillance programs , it is estimated that collectively , there will be a force of at least 300,000 such snitches . When PRP shows up at your door , you MD be well advised to tell them to VB lost and never come back . ⁃ TN Editor Contact Tracing ? RB ? That ’s the next JJ NN program to push for total surveillance over our lives . Now the real fallout from the Coronapocalypse comes to light . The very NNS who created a JJ NN out of faulty statistics , NN fear - pimping and the rankest of propaganda are now pushing the total surveillance NN to protect us ( them ? ) from the next NN . James Corbett from the Corbett Report just published an excellent NN discussing ‘ contact tracing ’ as promulgated by ( who else ? ) the NNP NNP Initiative to create an army of JJ Brown Shirts to assist our wise and benevolent leaders in managing us IN livestock . James is urging us not to VB their Orwellian term , and I agree with him . But the best NN to do that is to VB fun of it and them . I propose just looking at them and saying , “ Do n’t Trace Me , Bro . ” As always when they VBP to herd us towards a terrible idea they RB have to come up with a harmless sounding euphemism for it . Either that or just call it a NN that we ’re VBG to fight and win together , you VBP , for kids ! But this was always the plan with this NN . We can speculate as to why this has been done , why it was directed from the commanding heights of our society but , in the end , that speculation is irrelevant . This is happening , it ’s here and they are now working to square the circle . The goal is to finish off the last vestiges of anonymity and individuality started with the destruction of JJ privacy during the NNP Adminstration , which was wrapped in the classic NN phrases “ VB Your Customer ” and “ Anti-Money Laundering ” Now those sets of rules which got ramped up after 9/11 dominate the JJ JJ landscape . But , let ’s look at what ’s happened with NNP - CD step - by - step . RB , a NN shows up in China which NNS in the highest levels of our NN were briefed about as early as November , if Pepe Escobar ’s research is to be believed . The gold standard remains the ABC NNP report according to which intel collected in November 2019 by the National Center for NNP Intelligence ( NCMI ) , a subsidiary of the Pentagon ’s Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) , was already warning about a JJ virulent contagion getting out of hand in Wuhan , VBN on “ detailed analysis of intercepted communications and satellite imagery ” . An unnamed source told ABC , “ analysts concluded it MD be a cataclysmic event ” , adding the intel was “ briefed multiple times ” to the DIA , the Pentagon ’s Joint Chiefs of Staff , and RB the White NNP . Next China , the gold standard for the Orwellian Panopticon , proceeds to VB that Panopticon to prove to the NN how effective NN can be in containing a deadly plague . That NN , which runs fundamentally counter to billions of NNS of evolution and basid immunology , is then propagated IN the Western NN to combat NN - CD , a NN which has a mortality rate similar to the annual NN , to shut down those economies exacerbating a JJ NN already fully underway . This destroys the lives of hundreds of millions of NNS . It creates JJ dislocations that VBP the Great Depression look IN a mild recession . In places IN Italy , France and Spain where youth unemployment has been in double digits for more than a decade , the lock down was VBN as a NN to tamp down JJ unrest , as they were hot beds for opposition to inept and increasingly fascistic governments . In the U.S. , a NN ruled by JJ , ideologically - possessed and corrupt Boomers who have been in a heightened NN of fear since Donald NNP was elected saw the opportunity to create the worst possible outcome in places IN NNP York and California . Governors in blue NNS seized NN they did n’t legally have and cried for NN they did n’t need . And the confusion and disinformation about the NN created so much fear NNS willingly huddled in their homes hoping the angel of death passed them by with nothing more to do than be glued to the death counter in a desperate bid to stay informed about the NN . But there were n’t CD CD dead in the U.S. There ’s RB 50,000 and those death statistics are very speicous since the NNS reporting them have motive , means and opportunity to inflate them to VB Federal aid , advance their political agendas now on full display and cover their asses . So , now ‘ contact tracing ’ which is just a euphemism for total surveillance . But they are admitting that they ca n’t do it themselves . They need NN . In totalitarian governments IN the U.K. , they ’ll have an app in a couple of weeks . Matthew Gould RB disclosed plans to log the location of whenever CD or more NNS are in close proximity for minutes at a NN . Mr Gould told the NNP and Technology Committee the app MD be “ technically ready ” for deployment in “ CD to three weeks ” – but made it clear it was only CD part of the strategy to emerge from lockdown and MD involve a none - too - subtle marketing NN . “ If you VBP to protect the NHS and stop it being overwhelmed and , at the same NN , VB to VB the NN moving , then the app is VBG to be part of an essential part of a strategy for doing that , ” he VBD . China already has this . All across the enlightened West NNS will now recruit tens of thousands of ‘ contact tracers ’ to VB out and build their network for them , just IN Gavin Newsome and Andrew Cuomo discussed with Bill NNP in the NN linked above . And since there are now tens of millions of NNS out of work desperate for a job of any sort finding recruits will be easy . VB how this works ? RB you destroy NNS ’s lives , then you print trillions in funny NN to bail out the inept and continue paying the enforcers , ensuring they are fed . And then when desperation reaches its peak you create a JJ NN program and turn NNS into snitches to ensure compliance . We ’re VBG to empower the worst busybodies who are already insane with fear to run RB collecting NNS for the NN . All in the name of getting the NN back up and running ! I ’m pretty sure when I read The Scarlet Letter in high school we did n’t consider Hester Prynne to be the bad guy . Because the NN who is NNP - CD positive will now have a JJ red “ CV ” on them which will limit their ability to partake in society . The next stage will be to force them to lock themselves down in isolation or face the depredations of the NNP . And RB if we begin to ignore such insanity the next step will be to look the other NN when the contact tracers become belligerent . This is all about keeping everyone in a heightened NN of fear at all times . The Karens will bee worried about a stupid germ and everyone else will be worried about what the Karens will do . Because what good is this app if it does n’t report you to the authorities who VBP where you are . So the solution to a NN and the incompetence of our governments is to turn busy bodies into brown shirts and NN positives into JJ pariahs . Do you realize what happens when you do n’t pay a parking ticket now ? Eventually your licence gets suspended , then your car insurance gets canceled . If you do n’t turn your tag in for not having insurance then you are risking jail NN when you VBP stopped by the police . They arrest you for driving on a suspended licence , impound your car , and the entire ordeal becomes a bureaucratic nightmare . The moral of the story ? Pay your parking ticket , obviously . But not because you were a bad NN or committed a heinous crime . But because you broke the rules . If you do n’t follow the NNP ’s rules , no matter how petty , no matter how asinine you will be punished to the full extent of the law . Do you RB VB this ‘ contact tracing ’ NN wo n’t end up in the same kind of hell ? Now you ’re a documented threat to other NNS ’s lives ! You ’re an evil spreader , NN ! VB of the NNS ! The NNP is only good at CD things . Killing NNS and creating perverse incentives . And if this is n’t a classic NN of creating the perverse incentive of destroying civilization in order to save it I do n’t VB what is ? This is the real danger of 5G technology . It is n’t China having a backdoor embedded by Huawei , it is the NNP having the ability to blanket the NN in high bandwidth snooping devices everywhere that NNS congregate . Their NN is failing before our eyes . It ’s a NN born of corrupt NN begetting ever greater institutional corruption . They MD n’t be pushing for this total surveillance if they were n’t uniquely paranoid about our readiness to throw them overboard . They VBP us snitching on each other and suspect of each other . This is the most pernicious form of JJ NN ever devised , to distrust basic JJ contact and interaction because there are germs in the NN . It ’s NN to end the mass hallucination that we ’ve never dealt with something IN this before . The mass branding of this NN - CD as the plague is laughable and the push for JJ surveillance is pathetic . Unfortunately , we live in a NN today where the fearful are empowered by the powerful to mob the non-compliant . NNP - CD is n’t the plague folks . If you VBP it ’s the NN you should be fearful of I urge you to seek therapy not the JJ security of a NN tracking app . Tom Luongo is the publisher of the Gold Goats n Guns . Ruminations on Geopolitics , Markets and Goats . You can actually participate in the JJ efforts to cripple the Deep NNP organized criminal cabal 's ability for genocide , while enjoying healthcare freedom at the same NN , by boycotting NNP Pharma for good ."

The top secret papers disclose NNS from the organisation RB carried out scientific tests on "" hair or fur "" VBN to be from the mythical apeman . Peter Byrne , then the director of the NNP Information Center , wrote a letter in 1976 asking that the NNP "" set the record straight , once and for all "" . His call came after it was reported the bureau had analysed hair or fur that was not identifiable as "" that of any VBN NN on this continent "" . NNP Assistant Director Jay Cochran , who headed the bureau 's lab division at the NN , responded that he was unable to find any records of such an examination , the papers reveal . However , Byrne , then requested an examination of what he saw as an exciting JJ sample of NNP fur . "" We do not often come across hair which we are unable to identify and the hair that we have now , about 15 hairs attached to a tiny piece of NN , is the JJ that we have obtained in six NNS which we feel MD be of importance , "" Byrne wrote . Cochran responded saying while the NNP RB focused on criminal investigations "" in the interest of research and scientific inquiry , we VBP exceptions to this general policy "" . An image released by the NNP shows a hair and tissue sample sent to the NNP labs in the 1970s What is NNP and does it RB exist ? NNP , RB VBN as NNP , is VBN to be a JJ ape - JJ NN that is VBN to roam the Northwest of the US . There is scant evidence such creatures exist , but NNP buffs are convinced they do - and NN will CD day prove it . While most sightings occur in the Northwest , the mythical creatures have been reported all over the NN . The most famous image of a NNP is from a NN taken in 1967 by Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin in Bluff Creek , California . It shows a huge dark , man-sized and man-shaped figure lumbering through a woodland clearing . While widely considered a hoax , it remains to this day the best evidence for the existence of NNP . "" With this understanding , we will examine the hairs and tissue mentioned in your letter . "" The sample was then analysed to check its "" structure and thickness "" before being compared "" with hairs of VBN origin under a comparison microscope "" . However , the eventual results were not as Byrne had hoped , reports CNN . "" It was concluded as a result of these examinations that the hairs are of deer family origin , "" Cochran later revealed . The NNP made JJ 22 documents from it records archive on Wednesday - including its bulging 22 - page NNP file . Peter Byrne ’s web page VBZ that he “ has always had an interest in the unknown and the mysterious ” since his father VBD to tell him bedtime stories about the Yeti of the Himalayas . The page reveals he RB started looking for the Yeti in 1946 when he was still in the British Royal NNP Force in Bombay , India . ”"

The release and alleged NN by Melba S. Ketchum RB suggests such cryptids had sex with modern JJ females that resulted in hairy hominin hybrids , but the scientific community is dubious about her claim . "" A NN of NNS can verify that their five - NN JJ DNA NN , currently under peer - review , confirms the existence of a novel hominin hybrid NN , commonly called ' NNP ' or ' NNP , ' living in NNP NNP , "" the release reads . "" NNS ' extensive DNA sequencing suggests that the legendary NNP is a JJ relative that arose approximately 15,000 NNS RB . "" For her NN , Ketchum obtained three "" whole nuclear genomes from purported NNP samples . The genome sequencing shows that NNP mtDNA is identical to modern Homo sapiens , but NNP nuDNA is a novel , unknown hominin related to Homo sapiens and other primate NNS . "" ( Mitochondrial DNA , or mtDNA , is the DNA that resides in the NN 's NN - producing structures , and is typically passed down from mothers , while nuclear DNA , nuDNA , resides in the NNS ' nuclei and is passed down from both NNS to offspring . ) "" Our NNS indicate that the NNP NNP NNP is a hybrid NN , the result of males of an unknown hominin NN crossing with female Homo sapiens , "" the statement reads . [ Infographic : Tracking Belief in NNP ] So where 's the evidence ? Well , there is none . Not yet , anyway : Ketchum 's research has not appeared in any peer - reviewed scientific journal , and there 's no indication when that might happen . If the NNS are good and the NN is sound , any reputable NN journal MD jump at the chance to be the JJ to publish this groundbreaking information . Until then , Ketchum has refused to let anyone else VB her evidence . Of course the history of NNP is rife with exaggerated and premature claims about proof of the NN 's existence . For decades , various types of evidence have been offered as final , definitive proof , ranging from NNP hair to NN to dead bodies . Without exception , the evidence has always been hoaxed , misidentification or inconclusive . Because Ketchum has released no information at all about her findings ( nor have they been examined by outside experts ) , it 's impossible to evaluate the validity of her conclusions . But an important clue can be VBN in her statement that "" NNP mtDNA is identical to modern Homo sapiens . "" If the mitochontrial DNA is identical to Homo sapiens ( i.e. , modern NNS ) , then this suggests CD of CD options . The JJ , endorsed by Ketchum , is that NNP ancestors had sex with NNS about 15,000 NNS RB and created a half - JJ hybrid NNS currently hiding across NNP NNP . [ Rumor or Reality : The Creatures of Cryptozoology ] There is , however , another , simpler interpretation of such results : The samples were contaminated . Whatever the sample originally was — NN , bear , JJ or something else — it 's possible that the NNS who collected and handled the specimens accidentally introduced their DNA into the sample , which can easily occur with something as innocent as a spit , sneeze or cough . No NN outside of Ketchum 's NN knows how this alleged NNP DNA was collected , from where or by whom . It MD have been collected by the NN 's top forensics experts , or by a pair of amateur NNP buffs with no evidence - gathering training . How did the NN definitively determine that the samples were from a NNP ? Did they take a NN or saliva sample from a living NNP ? If so , how did they VB that close , and why did n't they simply capture it or photograph it ? If the samples were VBN in the wild , how do they VB it was n't left by another NN — or possibly RB a hunter , hiker or camper who left JJ genetic material ? Previous alleged NNP samples subjected to DNA analysis have been deemed "" unknown "" or "" unidentified . "" However , "" unknown "" or "" unidentified "" results do not mean "" NNP . "" There are JJ reasons why a DNA sample might come back unknown , including that it was contaminated or too degraded by JJ conditions . Or it MD simply mean that the NN it came from was not among the reference samples that the laboratory VBD for comparison . There is no reference sample of NNP DNA to compare it with , so by definition , there can not be a conclusive NN . Ketchum RB issued a statementrequesting that the U.S. NN immediately recognize NNP as "" an indigenous NNS and immediately protect their JJ and Constitutional rights against those who MD VB in their physical and cultural differences a ' license ' to hunt , trap , or kill them . "" Since no NNP has ever been hunted , trapped or killed , it 's not clear that the creatures — if they exist — require any special federal protection . Ketchum's is not the only genetics - VBN project intended to find NNP . Earlier this NN , NNS from Oxford NNP and the Lausanne Museum of Zoology announced they were collecting samples of alleged NNP and Yeti hair for genetic identification . Oxford geneticist Bryan Sykes collected materials from the NN from NNP through September , and is currently conducting DNA analysis . Once the results are in , he plans to submit his results to a peer - reviewed scientific journal . If Ketchum has the definitive proof she claims , the NN will soon VB about it , and NNP will be proven once and for all . On the other hand , if the evidence never appears , or is inconclusive and flawed , the search will continue .

It reveals how the agency hacks into consumer NNS to turn them into spying devices … and how it can RB remotely take NN of cars . Entitled Vault 7 : NNP Hacking Tools Revealed , the latest Wikileaks dump contains tons of documents explaining how the NNP has hundreds of zero - day exploits ( holes in software that are unknown to the vendor ) and can hack almost any smart tv , Android phone , iPhone , or router , and , apparently , recent cars as well . Not only that , the agency can RB leave the “ footprint ” of another entity while doing the hacking , effectively allowing them to put the blame on a foreign nation or organization . The documents VBP : The NNP , working with British spy agency MI5 , have developed a back door for a smart TV that allows NN snooping while the television is turned off . And that MD now include live NN streaming of your living room and office . In a 2014 document detailing future and improvements to the program , NNP officials VBD they planned to add a feature where the Agency MD capture NN and NN snapshots of NNS through their televisions . This MD put the federal NN and the NNP RB in your family room and office . Recently , the NNP lost NN of the majority of its hacking NN including malware , viruses , trojans , weaponized “ zero day ” exploits , malware remote NN systems and associated documentation . This extraordinary collection , which amounts to more than several hundred CD lines of code , gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the NNP . The archive appears to have been circulated among JJ U.S. NN hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner , CD of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive . According to the documents , the NNP has been using the NNP Department consulate in Frankfurt Germany as a headquarters for hackers in Europe , the Middle East , and Africa . The organization has been collecting a library of attack techniques from malware produced in other NNS , including NNP . The NNP has the ability to VB this library to misdirect attribution of hacks by leaving behind the “ fingerprints ” of stolen malware . Probably the most startling portion of this dump is the revelation that the NNP has gained the ability to “ hack ” into recent cars through their NN systems . Note that we are not RB talking about self - driving cars ( which will certainly become 100 % NNP - remote - controlled ) , but regular cars with computerized components ( IN 2011 and earlier ) . Why MD they VB to do that ? To “ engage in nearly undetectable assassinations ” . These revelations shed a JJ light on the very mysterious death of journalist Michael Hastings , who lost his NN after his car suddenly went out of NN and crashed . Hastings was a journalist , a contributing editor to Rolling Stone and reporter for BuzzFeed . He became a vocal critic of the surveillance NN during the investigation of reporters by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2013 , referring to the restrictions on the freedom of the press by the Obama administration as a “ NN ” on journalism . His last story , “ Why Democrats Love to Spy On Americans ” , was published by BuzzFeed on June 7 . Hastings died in a fiery high - speed automobile crash on June 18 , 2013 , in Los Angeles , California . On June 18 , 2013 , Hastings died in a single vehicle automobile crash in his Mercedes C250 Coupé at approximately 4:25 a.m. in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles . A witness to the crash VBD the car seemed to be traveling at maximum speed and was creating sparks and flames before it fishtailed and crashed into a palm tree . NN from a nearby security camera purportedly shows Hastings ’ vehicle speeding and bursting into flames . Witnesses described the car ’s engine being ejected 50 to 60 yards ( 46–55 m ) from the scene . Hastings ’ NN was burned beyond recognition . The coroner identified the NN by matching fingerprints with those the NNP had on file . CD days after the crash , the Los Angeles Police Department declared that there were no signs of foul play . The coroner ’s report ruled the death to be an accident . An autopsy showed that the NN of death was massive blunt force trauma consistent with a high - speed crash . – Los Angeles Times , “ Michael Hastings death : JJ NN of crash emerges ” A NN article from CD actually mentioned that Hasting ’s death was most IN the result of a “ car cyber attack ” . JJ U.S. National Coordinator for Security , Infrastructure Protection , and Counter - terrorism Richard A. Clarke VBD that what is VBN about the crash is “ consistent with a car cyber attack ” . He was quoted as saying “ There is reason to VB that intelligence agencies for major powers — including the NNP NNPS — VBP how to remotely seize NN of a car . So if there were a cyber attack on [ Hastings ’ ] car — and I ’m not saying there was , I VBP whoever did it MD probably VB away with it . ” “ Hastings ’ work as a thorn in the side of NN and the 33 - NN - JJ journalist ’s death in an unusual crash in June 2013 immediately triggered speculation . A witness reported seeing Hastings ’ JJ silver Mercedes C250 coupe speeding down a Hollywood street before dawn when it bounced , slammed into a tree and burst into flames . Shortly before Hastings ’ death , he sent what was described as a “ panicky ” email to friends expressing concern that associates were being interviewed by “ the Feds . ” He RB wrote that he was onto a JJ story and needed to “ VB off the radar for a bit . ” His 2010 story for Rolling Stone in which Stanley McChrystal skewered the White NNP and its strategy in Afghanistan led to the general ’s resignation . The NNP denied Hastings was the target of any investigation , yet a Freedom of Information Act request later unearthed an NNP file on Hastings . Hastings RB told a neighbor he thought someone had been tampering with his car . At the NN of his death , he was working on an article about NNP director John Brennan . – Who . What . Why , “ CAR HACKING REPORT REFUELS CONCERNS ABOUT MICHAEL HASTINGS CRASH ” According to several sources , Hasting ’s last days very hectic . “ In an email to colleagues , which was copied to and released by Hastings ’ friend , Army Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs , Hastings VBD that he was “ onto a JJ story ” , that he needed to “ VB off the radar ” , and that the NNP might interview them . WikiLeaks announced that Hastings had RB contacted Jennifer Robinson , CD of its lawyers , a few hours prior to the crash , and the LA Weekly reported that he was preparing JJ reports on the NNP at the NN of his death . His widow Elise Jordan VBD his final story was a profile of NNP Director John O. Brennan . The NNP released a statement denying that Hastings was being investigated . USA Today reported that in the days before his death , Hastings believed his car was being “ tampered with ” and that he was scared and wanted to leave town . ‘ At 12:30 a.m. on the morning he died , an agitated Michael Hastings went to his neighbor and friend Jordanna Thigpen and asked to borrow her car . He VBD he was afraid to drive his own car , because he believed that someone had been tampering with it . “ He was scared , and he wanted to leave town , ” Thigpen recalls . But she declined , saying her car was having mechanical problems . When she woke up , Hastings was dead , his car having crashed into a tree . ’ Hastings died in a single vehicle automobile crash in his Mercedes C250 Coupé at approximately 4:25 a.m. in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles . A witness to the crash VBD the car seemed to be traveling at maximum speed and was creating sparks and flames before it fishtailed and crashed into a palm tree . NN from a nearby security camera purportedly shows Hastings ’ vehicle speeding and bursting into flames . ” – USA TOday , “ Hastings thought his car was being tampered with ” Several US officials told CNN that a federal criminal investigation is being opened into WikiLeaks ’ publication of documents ."

And RB if yours seem identically matched , they do n't necessarily remain a constant size . Your NNS can actually be different sizes at different times of the day . There are RB more lasting changes : Most NNS gradually widen with age , and sometimes NNS 's NNS "" grow "" ( because of muscle relaxation during pregnancy ) after the birth of a child . Whatever the size of your NNS ( at any given NN ) it 's important to buy the JJ NNS -- NNS that will fit correctly and offer your NNS and ankles the support they need . The following suggestions will VB you become a smart shoe shopper . Shop for NNS in the late afternoon or evening , since that 's when your NNS are the biggest ( they swell during the day ) . Have the salesperson measure both NNS while you 're standing up , because your NNS expand under the weight of your NN . Carefully consider the fit and walking comfort of each pair of NNS you try and keep in mind that "" size 8 "" in three different styles , RB from the same manufacturer , can fit your NNS differently . If you have wide NNS , always ask ( RB if the salesperson has measured your NNS ) if the style you 've chosen comes in a wide width . Fortunately , comfortable NNS have become popular -- RB stylish -- and shoe manufacturers are waking up to the fact that not everyone has a medium - width NN . Some manufacturers VBP NNS as wide as triple - E ( on a scale of A to E , with AA being the narrowest ) . There are CD other contributors to your shoe "" size "" as well : The NN of your NN ( how the shoe 's "" upper "" conforms to your NN ) and the heel height that is best for you . Because high heels shift NN weight onto the front of your NNS , heavy NNS and NNS with bunions , corns , hammertoes , and the NN should opt for lower heels . If you have excessively pronated ( "" JJ "" ) NNS , Achilles tendinitis , short calf muscles , or knee problems , however , NNS with a moderate heel MD be more comfortable for you , because they lessen the pull on already - overstretched tendons and muscles . Once you VBP your size , you can begin to select NNS that will be more comfortable . However , give your NNS a break and avoid the six NN - foiling shoe styles discussed here : With all this in mind , now it 's NN to look for a JJ pair of NNS . Most NNS VBP that trying on NNS is about how the NNS feel on your NNS . That 's true . Certainly , if they do n't feel good , you do n't VB them . But you should evaluate NNS VBN on several more - specific factors : CD more general tips : If your CD NNS are different sizes , choose NNS that fit the bigger NN . ( You can pad or add support inserts to the other shoe . ) And never buy NNS that are too stiff or too tight with the expectation that you will "" break them in . "" You 're likely to suffer much longer than you expected . Although all this means that you must be a sophisticated and patient shoe shopper , the good NN is that JJ fashionable NNS currently on the NN meet all of these qualifications , and JJ RB resemble athletic NNS in design . This is especially good NN for the 59 percent of JJ NNS who wear high - heeled NNS every day . As consumers have become more NN conscious , shoe manufacturers have given JJ attention to developing good - looking NNS ( RB with heels ) that wo n't hurt your NNS . Selecting the JJ athletic shoe for the type of sport or exercise you enjoy is an RB more specific task . VB some pointers on this process on the next page .

Geologists have been marveling at this JJ NN print in rough granite , about 4 NNS JJ . Some still VBP that it is a natural erosion pattern , but for now it ’s hard to VB . Prof. Pieter Wagener from UPE , suggests that “ there is a higher probability of little JJ NNS arriving from NN and licking it out with their tongues , than being created by natural erosion . ” It is located in NNP Africa , near the town of Mpaluzi , close to the Swaziland border . It is estimated to be between 200 CD and 3 CD NNS JJ because of our current understanding of the formation of granites in NNP ’s history . This dating immediately causes great debate and argument – so I urge you to keep your mind open and focused on the evidence . This amazing footprint in granite was discovered in 1912 by a hunter called Stoffel Coetzee , while hunting in the remote area . At the NN this was a deeply remote part of NNP Africa VBN as the Eastern Transvaal , teeming with wildlife , including antelope and lions . It remains in the same condition as it was when RB discovered and the possibility that this was a carved hoax is extremely low because of its remote location . RB today , it is difficult to find . The real mystery is how this amazing phenomenon occurred – I have no idea – but here it is and we cannot wish it away . YES – It is granite – it is a well recognised geological part of NNP Africa and recorded on all geological maps – that is why this footprint is such an incredible mystery . It can be described as a “ phenocrystic ” granite , OR coarse porphyritic granite , that underwent several different stages of cooling . The result being an interesting mixture of JJ and small granules . This is why granite NNS are keen to mine this area for granite because it will look RB “ pretty ” when polished . In the official Geology Of NNP Africa , this outcrop is called Mpuluzi Batholith ( Granite ) and the official dating of this rock produced dates of RB 3,1 CD NNS . This bone has been in the vaults of of the JJ school at WITS NNP , Johannesburg since the early 1960s , when it was VBN by miners in a mine in northern Namibia . It is CD of the most precious and rare specimens available today that clearly indicate the existence of giants in Southern Africa more than 40,000 NNS RB .

An army of volunteers on Tuesday started pasting a colossal 160,000 square NNS paper image over the courtyard to prepare for the trompe l’oeil . The image will create the illusion of a larger pyramid emerging from rocks as if it had been discovered by an archaeological excavation . The 70 - NN - high glass - and - steel pyramid , designed by Chinese - JJ architect I.M. Pei , now aged 101 , was controversial when it was inaugurated in the classical setting of the Louvre in March 1989 . But has since become a beloved Paris landmark . “ The pyramid has always inspired me , the NN it mixes the ancient and the modern , ” JR told Reuters . “ This NN , a JJ part of it is to confront the modern with archaeology . ” The JJ trompe l’oeil will be fully visible from Friday evening only from the museum ’s roof . JR ’s NN has installed CD JJ screens on the courtyard to allow visitors to VB the result from the ground . For CD days , Saturday and Sunday , the courtyard will be open for visitors to walk on it and observe the optical illusion . “ Once everything is pasted , NNS will be over the image and it will fade away and disappear , ” JR VBD . The interactive part of the project – volunteers enrolling to paste 32 - NN - JJ paper strips and tourists walking , watching and appearing on the NN shot from above – is what attracted the Louvre authorities . “ The visitor is always at the heart of our concern , with always the goal to better welcome them , ” Louvre NN Jean - Luc Martinez VBD . The performance is a continuation of a JJ trompe l’oeil three NNS RB that made the pyramid disappear behind a JJ black - and - white photo . The pyramid is the most popular of a series of ambitious projects launched by then NNP Francois Mitterrand in the 1980s and 1990s that changed the image of the French capital . “ Les grands travaux ” , as they were dubbed , were criticized at their conception because their modern NN conflicted with traditional Parisian architecture ."

Professor Neil NNP , director of the MRC Centre for NNP Infectious NNP Analysis at Imperial College , London , authored a report which forecast that terrible death toll if nothing was done to stop the spread of the NN . RB plans to slow the NN – letting RB CD - thirds of the population catch NN to build up ‘ herd immunity ’ – MD result in 250,000 deaths , according to Imperial ’s mathematical NN . Prof NNP ’s devastating conclusion led the Prime Minister to perform a drastic U - turn a fortnight RB . Schools were closed and NNS told to stay at home . Last week , Prof NNP told MPs these measures MD VB the eventual death toll cut to ‘ substantially less ’ than 20,000 . Meanwhile a paper by separate colleagues at Imperial predicted just 5,700 deaths if the lockdown continues . Now a rival academic has claimed Prof NNP has a patchy record of modelling epidemics , which MD have led to hasty Ministerial decisions . Professor Michael Thrusfield of Edinburgh NNP VBD Prof NNP was previously instrumental in modelling that led to the cull of more than 6 CD NNS during the NN and mouth outbreak in 2001 , which left rural Britain economically devastated . Then , Prof NNP and his Imperial colleagues concluded : ‘ Extensive culling is sadly the only option for controlling the current British epidemic . ’ But Prof Thrusfield , an expert in NN NNS , claimed the NN made incorrect assumptions about how NN and mouth NN was transmitted and , in a 2006 review , he claimed Imperial ’s NN and mouth NN was ‘ not fit for purpose ’ , while in 2011 he VBD it was ‘ severely flawed ’ Read More : Imperial College Prof Neil NNP Accused Of ‘ Patchy Record Of Modeling Pandemics ’"

It was the JJ documentary produced by the National Geographic Society , and it made Jane Goodall a star . RB , a wife , and then , mother . She married van Lawick , and in 1967 gave birth to a son , Hugo Eric Louis , VBN as Grub . She is the author of dozens of books on chimp and NN behavior , as well as on the critical role of conservation . In 1977 , she founded the Jane Goodall Institute , a nongovernmental organization devoted to protecting the rapidly disappearing chimp habitat . In 1995 she was made a Commander of the British Empire , and became Dame Jane Morris - Goodall , DBE . Born Valerie Jane Morris - Goodall in London in 1934 , her father , Mortimer , was a businessman ; her mother , Myfanwe ( Vanne ) Morris Goodall , was a novelist and looked after her family . The expectations for Jane were standard issue for the NN : a marriage to a nice , responsible NN , followed by a few NNS . To her credit , her mother never discouraged her interests : NNS , the natural NN , and above all , the wildlife of Africa . Once Vanne discovered that little Jane had brought a handful of earthworms to bed ; rather than shrieking , she explained that her JJ little friends needed the NN to live , and together , they took them back to the garden . Jane was a quiet girl , a bookworm who adored NNP Dolittle and devoured the Tarzan novels . Reading did its usual stealthy , NN - changing thing : Jane developed a deep love of NNS and a longing to VB to Africa and live among the wild NNS . But NNP NNP II was raging , and her family had little NN . Instead of NN , Jane enrolled in secretarial college , graduating in 1952 . Meanwhile , CD of Jane ’s school friends had moved to Kenya and invited her to come for a visit . Jane was working in London selecting music for advertising films at the NN . In a move that seems so very RB now , she moved home and worked as a waitress to finance the trip . When she had saved enough , she quit her job and off she went . By which I mean she took an exciting , month - JJ journey from England , IN the Cape of Good Hope , to Mombasa , eventually making her NN to Nairobi . There she met Dr. Louis Leakey , the great archaeologist and paleoanthropologist who traced our JJ origins to Africa . Leakey was charismatic , influential , and , at the NN , a curator at Nairobi ’s natural history museum . He offered Jane a job there , then invited her to come along on a dig at Olduvai Gorge . She spent three glorious months immersed in painstaking tasks : removing dirt from a fossil with a dental pick no bigger than your pinkie finger , or digging gently with a hunting knife . Leakey saw in her a NN who was patient and thorough : CD who MD survive JJ stretches of isolation , who MD sit and watch and learn . In short , she was the perfect candidate for his latest project — observing primates in the wild — and when he asked whether she MD be interested in setting up camp at Gombe Stream on the shores of remote Lake Tanganyika , she did n’t hesitate for a moment ."

NNP NNP has a show called “ Finding NNP , ” with a guy looking IN he just cleaned out all the pork rinds at the Piggly Wiggly telling us he believes “ there ’s a “ squatch ” in these woods … . ” “ Sasquatches DO exist , ” insists another NN hunter , doing his best to look and sound serious , in the show ’s accidentally comical commercial . We should n’t single out NNP NNP for scorn , however . The channel does have silly NN . The History Channel has a show called UFO Hunters . NNP NNP has a show called UFOs over NNP . These and other channels show Nostradamus programs more regularly than they show microscopes and telescopes combined . Against this backdrop , I suppose we should n’t be surprised by incessantly ridiculous claims and headlines about JJ NN . JJ NN causes earthquakes . JJ NN causes depression . JJ NN causes tsunamis . JJ NN causes wife beatings . JJ NN causes acne . JJ NN causes AIDS . JJ NN causes a greater likelihood of a UFO invasion . No , seriously , scientist - activists and their NN allies have alleged each of the above , and then some . Just as microscopes and telescopes are glaringly missing on the “ NN ” and “ history ” shows about sasquatches and UFOs , so too is the Scientific Method glaringly missing from alarming JJ NN claims . “ JJ NN is a NN because our computer NNS predict it will be . ” But your computer NNS predicted more NN for the present than has actually occurred . ” “ Um , well , we have fixed that . RB . ” Do n’t your billions of dollars of annual NN funding dry up if JJ NN turns out not to be a NN ? “ Maybe , but we are guided by altruism and NN . ” Can we take a look at the original NNS you VBD and can we examine your procedures ? “ Why should I show them to you when you will simply try to find something wrong with them ? ” Because that is how NN works . Can we VB them please ? “ No , that MD violate my privacy rights and my academic freedom . ” Then why should we VB a JJ NN NN truly exists ? I guess if such ridiculous circular logic passes for NNP Age NN and if such ridiculous alleged harms as acne , wife beatings and UFO invasions are presented as legitimate JJ NN crises , then why should we NOT have NNP , UFOs and Nostradamus appearing front and center on NN and history programs . Did you hear about the most recent NN ? JJ NN is causing mutant sharks . CD different shark subspecies appear to be breeding together in the waters off the coast of NNP . The Australian blacktip shark and the common blacktip shark seem to have been listening to Barry White music and getting their groove on together . Kind of IN wolves breeding with husky dogs or German shepherds breeding with golden retrievers . No JJ deal , RB , except that some clever rainmaker for NN grants has VBN a NN to assert a connection with JJ NN . “ The Australian blacktip is smaller and tends to live in warmer waters near northern and eastern NNP . Its globally distributed counterpart , the common blacktip , is larger and favors cooler waters , ” explains the Jan. 3 Christian NNP Monitor . Did you VB that ? The Australian blacktip shark lives in warm waters . The common blacktip shark lives globally , in both warm and cool waters , but allegedly “ favors cooler waters . ” Therefore , if a few Australian blacktips and a few common blacktips VBP together and do the wild thing , JJ NN must be the reason . Now somebody please start shoveling some NN grants our NN . By the NN , what type of scientific evidence supports the asserted JJ NN connection ? Please allow me to quote the Huffington Post : “ Lead researcher Jess Morgan VBD , ‘ If [ the Australian blacktip ] hybridizes with the common NNS it can effectively shift its range further RB into cooler waters , so the effect of this hybridizing is a range expansion . ’ ” OK , let ’s VB this straight . The immensely intelligent and forward - thinking Australian blacktip shark knows that NNS are burning fossil fuels and have just failed to renew the Kyoto Protocol . This MD seem to be good NN for the warm NN - loving Australian blacktip . Nevertheless , the Australian blacktip realizes that too much of its favored warm NN might at some point in the future become a bad thing . Therefore , the Australian blacktips all got together and came up with a scheme to seduce unsuspecting common blacktip sharks so that they can find a NN to survive in COOLER waters .

After a NN and a half of being subject to a ruthless NN - by - NN , a JJ process is only now being initiated that from my perspective allows me to come forward for the JJ NN to tell my side of the story before an investigating tribunal operating within the terms of our collective agreement . The process is VBG forward because of a NN contestation that the U of L Board of Governors lost due to its unwillingness to adhere to the laws of labour relations in Alberta . Whose advice was the Board depending on when its members put themselves in such an untenable position ? Before we have RB started the process that has come about because of the determined stand of the NNP of Lethbridge Faculty Association ( ULFA ) and the Canadian Association of NNP Teachers ( CAUT ) , you , Premier Notley , chose to inject a politicized salvo into the onslaught of vituperation against me that began on Aug. 26 of CD . Here is how the NNP of Lethbridge Faculty Association described your ill - advised political intervention : The Faculty Association wishes to express its disappointment in the Premier ’s words . As the union that represents Professor Hall in his employment relationship with the NNP of Lethbridge , the Faculty Association has endeavoured to have a fair and objective process employed for adjudicating Professor Hall ’s academic scholarship and accountability through procedures in the collective agreement . We finally achieved this following significant effort and cost on our part and have a great deal of confidence in the appropriate academic procedures to which Professor Hall is now subject . Having the Premier draw conclusions about the acceptability of Professor Hall ’s academic work prior to any decision rendered by an expert panel of qualified academics has the potential to undermine this very process we have fought to achieve . At worse , though , these words have the real potential to bias the outcome of any such fair and objective process . The Faculty Association has greatly appreciated the hard work the Premier and her NN have done to advance the rights of post - secondary labour . We VBP it is a dangerous precedent , however , for elected officials to intervene so directly in a complex labour matter such as this NN . CD of the core points I intend to bring forward in my self - defense in the forthcoming process , is to describe the mounting of a negative NN NN against me VBN on the atrocious contents of a maliciously - engineered NNP post . According to B’nai Brith Canada , the core agency in orchestrating this NN deception , the post appeared on , and then disappeared from , my NNP wall during an interval of a few hours on Aug. 26 , CD . I did not invite this digital item onto my NNP wall . I did not sanction its abhorrent contents . In fact I condemned the post ’s contents publicly in mid-Sept . when I RB became aware of the digital item and the NN that it was being deployed to destroy my reputation . You , Premier Notley , were presented with a deceptive account of my relationship to the NNP post RB before I RB knew about the B’nai Brith Canada operation . Recently I learned from the results of a FOIP investigation of the Alberta Ministry of Justice that on Aug. 27 , CD you and other Alberta cabinet ministers were sent a slanderous account of the NNP post as if it “ came from my lips . ” NNS in the inner circle of your office reported you had seen the communication that slanderously misrepresented me as an “ advocate for the murder of Jews . ” If you MD actually take a genuine interest in my academic work , Premier Notley , you MD realize I have a record of studying all sorts of genocide and condemning this crime against humanity in all its manifestations , including the Jewish Shoah . [ 2 ] Perhaps the NNS who lied to you about me in late August of CD are still holding you captive in terms of filtering the information that has caused you to VB whatever it is you VBP you VBP about me . The NNP of the NNP of Lethbridge , Dr. Michael J. Mahon , went along with the NNP deception to suspend this tenured full professor on Oct. 3 and 4 , CD . I was pulled from the classroom in mid-term and banned from stepping NN on campus . This purge took place entirely outside the terms of the collective agreement between the NN ’s faculty and administration . This suspension initially without pay essentially declared me guilty until proven innocent . Severe punitive measures were imposed on me all without RB an ounce of adjudication by a neutral third - party . From the correspondence I have been receiving from all over the NN , I can VB my suspension quickly became a shot heard throughout the JJ academic realm , a shot signaling that an Albertan NN is leading an attack on the institutions of tenure , peer review and academic freedom . Now you have joined in that attack too Premier Notley . You have allied yourself with the position of B’nai Brith Canada , the organization that recently interfered in the leadership race for the JJ leader of the federal NDP . The same NNS that set in motion the NN - by - NN aimed at me attacked the NDP leadership candidate , Niki Ashton . According to B’nai Brith ’s CEO Michael Mostyn , Ms. Ashton ’s concern for the violated JJ rights of Palestinians NNS made her “ an advocate for vile terrorists ” and “ convicted murders . ” It revealed Ms. Ashton ’s “ defective moral compass . ” [ 3 ] What is your view , Premier Notley , of the condemnation directed at the JJ NDP federal leader , Jagmeet Singh , when B’nai Brith Canada took aim at him for intervening to provide a venue at the Ontario provincial legislature for a presentation by academic advocates of the rights of educator Nadia Shoufani . The condemnation came in late Augusts of CD when Mr. Singh was MLA for the riding of Bramalea - Gore - Malton and Deputy Leader of the Ontario NDP . At the same NN as it was attacking Jagmeet Singh , B’nai Brith Canada was leading the effort to have Ms. Shofani , a Canadian of Palestinian and Christian background , criminalized by police and fired from her teaching job in the Dufferin - Peel Catholic School Board . The criticisms directed at Ms. Shoufani are similar to those directed at Ms. Ashton . Similarly , the effort to criminalize Ms. Shoufani and bar her from the classroom anticipated the similar NN to which I was about to be subjected . The attack on Ms. Shoufani ’s job and her reputation was VBN on allegations about her supposed “ terror - supporting remarks ” made in a Quds Day speech in Toronto in July of CD . [ 4 ] It seems , Premier Notley , your political intervention on the wrong side of the NNP of Lethbridge NN reflects your reactionary alliance with the thought police and speech police at B’nai Brith Canada . Your reactionary stance identifies you with the backward policies of JJ NDP leader , Tom Mulcair , when he purged pro-Palestinian candidates from the federal NN of CD . This atrocious move was in all probably a significant factor in the disappointing electoral showing of the NDP as it lost its position of Canada ’s Official Opposition Party . [ 5 ] Now in Feb. of 2018 B’nai Brith Canada has resumed its efforts to quarterback the NDP , lobbying aggressively to stop a resolution from being put on the floor of the recent NDP convention . The vote , neverthess , was close , 189 for putting the resolution forward and 200 for sidelining it . The resolution included provisions on a Canadian boycott against NNS produced in the illegal Israeli settlements in the Occupied West Bank . Those supporting the boycott resolution included the unanimous support of the NNP NNP Democrats , 28 electoral riding associations covering six provinces and JJ current and JJ MPs . Geneviève Nevin , a supporter of the resolution from Victoria , observed , “ There ’s a generational divide on this issue . ” In his account of this divide within the NDP , journalist Derrick O’Keefe suggested Jagmeet Singh MD be wise to look to the example of Jeremy Corbyn in the UK . Mr. Corbyn has mobilized on behalf of the Labour Party considerable electoral support from his attentiveness to the plight of Palestinian NNS under Israeli occupation . [ 6 ] By siding so strongly , Premier Notley , with the U of L administration ’s collaboration with the Isreal lobby including B’nai Brith Canada and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs , you have identified yourself and your NN with agencies that condemned Hassan Diab wrongly as a terrorist . B’nai Brith Canada played a major role in calling for pulling the sociology teacher from his Carleton NNP classroom in Ottawa . This intervention helped set in notion a miscarriage of justice that saw the Lebanese Canadian academic incarcerated for a decade in Canada and France for a crime he did n’t commit . [ 7 ] You have identified yourself and your NN , Premier Notley , with notorious enemies of academic freedom who brought forward during the 50th anniversary of York NNP all sorts of JJ allegations much IN those I am facing now . This fiasco unfolded when B’nai Brith Canada , the CIJA , the Canadian Jewish Congress and the Jewish Defence NNP tried to shut down an academic conference on Israel / Palestine at York NNP in 2009 . The effort to sabotage this academic initiative was foiled because the York NNP NNP , Mamdou Shoukiri , and the York NNP Board of Governors stood up for the imperatives of academic freedom . [ 8 ] In 2018 in Alberta the equation is very different . The NNP and Board of NNP of Lethbridge have adopted the position of the Israel lobby . Now Premier Notley , you have intervened to strengthen this political coalition favouring the stiffling of free and open debate at Alberta universities . Please consider revisiting you provocative and intellectually bankrupt position on this matter . [ 1 ] Chuck Millar ’s Letter to the Alberta Premier — 11 January , 2018 at There is no question that the views of this individual are repulsive , offensive and not reflective of Alberta . Our classrooms are a place for freedom of speech and expression but that does not mean individuals VB to stand at the head of the class and spread lies and NN NNS . I am terribly disappointed to learn that this individual has been reinstated , but let me be clear that legislation that our NN introduced did not give him his job back .

If the political press was so overmatched then , VB of our JJ press today which is no NN for JJ - cap corporations IN Amazon , NNP , Alphabet , RB Apple . They avoid any discussion of pivotal variables in their future , research priorities or sector operating profit margins . You MD drive a bus through Amazon ’s forecast of upcoming revenues and earnings , but a bus full of analysts blindly forecasts numbers that quarter - after - quarter wildly miss the mark , not just for Amazon , but Apple , NNP , Alphabet and Alibaba , too . The negative press for these babies does n’t relent . Past Sunday ’s NNP York Times published a 16 - page special section called “ The Decade Tech Lost Its NN . ” NNP and Mark Zuckerberg , particularly , are cited for hurting democracy and spreading misinformation . Maybe yes , maybe no . Let ’s hope CNN keeps the NNP administration fairly honest , day by day . Some background on the NNP York Times : RB , it ’s been a terrible investment these past 35 NNS while Rupert Murdoch took his NNP Corporation to the NN . The NYT ticked in the twenties back in 1987 , presently $ 32.70 . They leveraged themselves to buy the Boston Globe near the peak for newspaper publishing valuation , completely missing the nearly irrepressible surge in broadcasting , particularly subscription television . The cardinal investment precept is never VB bogged down in basket NNS . I ’m reminded of my mother ’s experience with U.S. Steel which she bought in the fifties because she thought it was a bargain with a good dividend . But , its price is down some 90 % since 1959 and its dividend was just cut to CD cent . Nothing good happened to U.S. Steel . It still makes plenty of steel but periodically shutters blast furnaces . Its NN value is maybe $ 3 CD while Apple , Amazon and Alphabet trade near a trillion bucks , NNP sits at a lousy $ 600 CD , but ready to break out . Consider , back in 1974 , basic industrials accounted for nearly 20 % of the NN ’s capitalized valuation . Today , we ’re under 5 % . Technology in 1974 , RB after the tremendous growth in semiconductors since early sixties , was as yet at 10 % of the NN . Technology , at 20 % of total sector weightings , seems headed much higher . Microsoft is ahead over 50 % from its 12 - month low while Apple is a double . Yes , up from $ 142 . For the NYT to single out tech for losing its NN this past decade does n’t do justice to these tremendous overachievers and what it ’s meant for our NN , the stock NN and the NN ’s primacy in internet and e-commerce sectors . Alibaba , I VBP , is a sounder play than Amazon , but nobody takes away Jeff Bezos ’ achievement as a leading player , from scratch , in cloud computing . Alibaba ’s momentum in e-commerce prevails while Amazon as yet shows minimal margins in e-commerce . I VBP Alibaba developing its Ant JJ reach , particularly in NN management , potentially a $ 500 CD business over five NNS , presently valued at $ 150 CD . When I look at NNP , my focus is on operating cash flow and the awesome reinvestment in research and NN , near 20 % of revenues . With the S&P 500 Index at 18 times forward 12 - month projections , a heady multiplier , NNP sells RB 20 times my projection of operating income and at 15 times next NN ’s operating cash flow . Stock is at 20 times my $ 10 a share earnings estimate for 2020 . MD you rather speculate in U.S. Steel with a penny dividend ( how foolish can you VB ) ? My point is Mark Zuckerberg has paid for his hubris . As a stock , NNP was $ 80 some five NNS RB , but past CD NNS scarcely gained 10 % . It is yet to take out the JJ high of $ 220 set in 2018 . With a NN capitalization IN $ 600 CD it MD never catch Apple and Microsoft , but Microsoft is no longer a bargain and I can’t VB Apple with any conviction . I ’m projecting NNP ’s 2020 operating cash flow at $ 40 CD , a serious number . The NNP York Times should send its JJ reporters to night school for MBAs . Unless they deal with numbers , with a strong background in the JJ history of the NN , they ’ll VB conclusions that are off - base and carry no weight or insight . NN capitalization of the NYT sits RB $ 10 CD , not exactly a NNP in the making , although you MD VB they ’re both in the same business , communications . But , the Sulzbergers underplayed the biggest , most lurid NN in NNP NNP II . Namely , the destruction of millions of innocent Jews . Did their German Jewish origins VB in the NN ? Maybe . German Jews look down their noses , still , on Eastern - JJ Jewry . Ironically , JJ decades RB , I owned 15 % of the NYT capitalization . I bought Saul Steinberg ’s block . Saul thought he MD break the family trust on CD classes of stock , but he MD n’t . Mike Milken brokered the trade . I made some NN and NNS later moved on with no regrets . Somehow , the achievement scope of internet operators IN NNP goes unregarded , RB ignored . Journalists hone in on Zuckerberg , himself , because Zuck makes for racy copy . Nobody cares to mention the Nasdaq 100 Index is ahead 45 % this NN . Yes , 45 % . The magic of technological leverage plays on . NNP logs awesome raw numbers . R&D runs at $ 14 CD annualized , up 30 % in the September quarter , NN - over - NN . Earnings rate is approaching $ 25 CD annualized . Contrast all this with U.S. Steel ’s CD - penny dividend . There ’s no leverage in earnings NN for basic industrials . Apple , Alphabet , NNP , Microsoft and Amazon comprise 20 % of the NN ’s valuation . Without their built - in buoyancy , the NN MD languish . General Electric will never be a great operator while Exxon Mobil is an RB - ran . General Motors ’ come back from death ’s door is notable but nobody cares much . The NNP York Times remains the “ NNP Gray Lady ” while NNP is IN Elvis Presley , swiveling his hips , kinetic footwork , belting out “ Hound Dog . ” Sosnoff and / or his managed accounts own : NNP , Alibaba , Alphabet and Microsoft ."

His_PRP$ website_NN is_VBZ www.BenjaminRadford.com._ADD","Genetic testing confirms the legendary NNP is a JJ relative that arose some 15,000 NNS RB — at least according to a press release issued by a NN called DNA Diagnostics detailing supposed work by a Texas veterinarian . The report from Melba S. Ketchum RB suggests such cryptids had sex with modern JJ females that resulted in hairy hominin hybrids , but the scientific community is dubious about her claim . "" A NN of NNS can verify that their five - NN - JJ DNA NN , currently under peer - review , confirms the existence of a novel hominin hybrid NN , commonly called ' NNP ' or ' NNP , ' living in NNP NNP , "" the release reads . "" NNS ' extensive DNA sequencing suggests that the legendary NNP is a JJ relative that arose approximately 15,000 NNS RB . "" For her NN , Ketchum obtained three "" whole nuclear genomes from purported NNP samples . The genome sequencing shows that NNP mtDNA is identical to modern Homo sapiens , but NNP nuDNA is a novel , unknown hominin related to Homo sapiens and other primate NNS . "" ( Mitochondrial DNA , or mtDNA , is the DNA that resides in the NN 's NN - producing structures , and is typically passed down from mothers , while nuclear DNA , nuDNA , resides in the NNS ' nuclei and is passed down from both NNS to offspring . ) "" Our NNS indicate that the NNP NNP NNP is a hybrid NN , the result of males of an unknown hominin NN crossing with female Homo sapiens , "" the statement reads . [ Infographic : Tracking Belief in NNP ] So where 's the evidence ? Well , there is none . Not yet , anyway : Ketchum 's research has not appeared in any peer - reviewed scientific journal , and there 's no indication when that might happen . If the NNS are good and the NN is sound , any reputable NN journal MD jump at the chance to be the JJ to publish this groundbreaking information . Until then , Ketchum has refused to let anyone else VB her evidence . Of course the history of NNP is rife with exaggerated and premature claims about proof of the NN 's existence . For decades , various types of evidence have been offered as final , definitive proof , ranging from NNP hair to NN to dead bodies . Without exception , the evidence has always been a hoax , misidentification or inconclusive . Because Ketchum has released no information at all about her findings ( nor have they been examined by outside experts ) , it 's impossible to evaluate the validity of her conclusions . But an important clue can be VBN in her statement that "" NNP mtDNA is identical to modern Homo sapiens . "" If the mitochontrial DNA is identical to Homo sapiens ( i.e. , modern NNS ) , then this suggests CD of CD options . The JJ , endorsed by Ketchum , is that NNP ancestors had sex with NNS about 15,000 NNS RB and created a half - JJ hybrid NNS currently hiding across NNP NNP . [ Rumor or Reality : The Creatures of Cryptozoology ] There is , however , another , simpler interpretation of such results : The samples were contaminated . Whatever the sample originally was — NN , bear , JJ or something else — it 's possible that the NNS who collected and handled the specimens accidentally introduced their DNA into the sample , which can easily occur with something as innocent as a spit , sneeze or cough . No NN outside of Ketchum 's NN knows how this alleged NNP DNA was collected , from where or by whom . It MD have been collected by the NN 's top forensics experts , or by a pair of amateur NNP buffs with no evidence - gathering training . • • All lightning on NNP MD have its roots in NN , JJ research suggests . • How our brains can track a 100 mph pitch Confirming it's NNP How did the NN definitively determine that the samples were from a NNP ? Did they take a NN or saliva sample from a living NNP ? If so , how did they VB that close , and why did n't they simply capture it or photograph it ? If the samples were VBN in the wild , how do they VB it was n't left by another NN — or possibly RB a hunter , hiker or camper who left JJ genetic material ? Previous alleged NNP samples subjected to DNA analysis have been deemed "" unknown "" or "" unidentified . "" However , "" unknown "" or "" unidentified "" results do not mean "" NNP . "" There are JJ reasons why a DNA sample might come back unknown , including that it was contaminated or too degraded by JJ conditions . Or it MD simply mean that the NN it came from was not among the reference samples that the laboratory VBD for comparison . There is no reference sample of NNP DNA to compare it with , so by definition , there can not be a conclusive NN . Ketchum RB issued a statement requesting that the U.S. NN immediately recognize NNP as "" an indigenous NNS and immediately protect their JJ and Constitutional rights against those who MD VB in their physical and cultural differences a ' license ' to hunt , trap , or kill them . "" Since no NNP has ever been hunted , trapped or killed , it 's not clear that the creatures — if they exist — require any special federal protection . Ketchum's is not the only genetics - VBN project intended to find NNP . Earlier this NN , NNS from Oxford NNP and the Lausanne Museum of Zoology announced they were collecting samples of alleged NNP and Yeti hair for genetic identification . Oxford geneticist Bryan Sykes collected materials from the NN from NNP through September , and is currently conducting DNA analysis . Once the results are in , he plans to submit his results to a peer - reviewed scientific journal . If Ketchum has the definitive proof she claims , the NN will soon VB about it , and NNP will be proven once and for all . On the other hand , if the evidence never appears , or is inconclusive and flawed , the search will continue .

You pay more attention to actions than words . You pay a lot more attention to the things NNS do than the things they VBP . You do n’t let them VB you or waste your NN . If they VBP they will do something and refuse to follow through NN and NN again , you cut ties . We as NNS ca n’t just keep giving chance after chance . 8 . You do not have any kind of ‘ fear of missing out . ’ As an alpha , you VBP that you ’re never missing out on anything . You VBP that if you VBP to do something you can VB out and do it .

But it seems that the NN and NN officials MD not be the only ones with their eyes on the NNP Apple . Coinciding with the skyrocketing number of NNS of NN in NYC , there has RB been an increase in UFO sightings in the skies over Manhattan . Most recently a Manhattan woman claimed to have spotted a strange UFO hovering over the area . According to the eyewitness , the mysterious object followed her as she was taking her dog for a walk . The woman , who did not reveal her identity , reported her encounter via the UFO Sightings Daily blog . According to her , she took her dog out for a walk at IN 8 o’clock p.m. on the evening of April 21 , near the upper west side of NNP York City . As she and her dog were walking down the street , she noticed a bright light in the sky . At RB , she thought it was an airplane . However , after walking about half a block , she spotted the same bright object in the sky again . According to the woman , the object did not appear to be moving in a specific direction . Instead , it seemed it was following her as she continued to take her dog for a walk . “ I did half [ a ] block with my dog [ and ] I stopped again and noticed this light [ moved into ] position , but [ it ] was not VBG in a clear direction , ” the woman stated according to UFO Sightings Daily . “ When I [ started ] walking , I noticed this light [ was ] RB moving . When I stopped , the light stopped parallel to me . ” The eyewitness noted that she observed the strange light by walking outside to VB if it MD still follow her . She VBD that wherever she went , the object moved in the same direction . The woman VBD she spent almost an hour walking outside her apartment to observe the strange light ’s movements . Although the NN she took is not clear enough to VB identify the strange object , it is possible that it was a drone being controlled by someone in the area . It is possible that the NN controlling the drone was deliberately following the woman through a mounted camera as a form of a prank , or its movements were purely coincidental . Various NN outlets including CNN and The Hill have reported that drones are sometimes being VBN in the city to monitor the current lockdown status . Others however , speculate that it is not terrestrial authorities that are monitoring the ongoing NN - CD outbreak , but aliens , who themselves are responsible for the release of the NN , as some kind of precursor to invasion . Interestingly enough , the increase in UFO sightings in the skies over NNP York City comes on the heels of the Pentagon recently confirming that three formerly classified videos taken by Navy pilots were officially interactions with “ unidentified aerial phenomena . ” Do you VB it is possible that extraterrestrials / UFOs are responsible for the NN - CD outbreak ?

""_''","COTTON ISLAND , Louisiana ( The Town Talk ) -- NNS are still visiting the area where CD loggers claim to have seen a NNP NN , but a wildlife agent now VBZ he thinks the reported sightings are a hoax . "" RB now we 're treating it as a hoax , "" VBD Kevin Hill of the NN Department of Wildlife and Fisheries . Despite the likelihood of a hoax , Hill VBD , the matter is still under investigation by the DWF and Rapides Parish Sheriff 's Office . Meanwhile , the CD loggers -- log foreman Earl Whitstine and saw - cutter Carl Michael Dubois , both of Grant Parish -- are sticking tight to their story that they saw a NNP NN in the Cotton Island area of northeast Rapides Parish last week . Their boss , Joe Delrie , owner of Delrie Wood NNPS of Colfax , VBZ he believes their tale wholeheartedly , despite others ' skepticism about the authenticity of the alleged NNP sightings and tracks VBN in Boggy Bayou . Mary Ward , the owner of the NN where the reported sightings took place , VBD RB 200 NNS have come out to her property to view the plaster cast taken from a "" NNP "" footprint and the Boggy Bayou NN . "" They all VBP away pretty well convinced , "" Ward VBD . A sign put up over the weekend at the entrance to Ward 's property reads "" NNP NNP Protection Area . "" She VBD a NNP supporter asked for her permission to place it in that prominent position . She VBD visitors are welcome as RB as they only shoot with cameras . No guns or dogs allowed . Whitstine VBD he saw the unusual NN once on Tuesday morning and again on Thursday while working with Dubois . Whitstine and Dubois flatly deny they concocted a hoax , saying they had nothing to gain from such a ruse . "" Me and that NN ( Whitstine ) seen what we seen . It was JJ , hairy and had JJ NNS , "" Dubois VBD . The CD NNS were working in the Cotton Island area removing hardwood logs , they VBD , when the NN made his CD appearances . Whitstine 's father , R.C. Whitstine , admitted this week that he was involved in a NNP hoax more than 25 NNS RB . Earl Whitstine VBD that he did not remember the incident well , but did VB he did n't VB his father was involved in the hoax where "" NNP "" tracks were discovered near Willianna . "" At the NN , they VBD , ' Somebody IN R.C. MD do something IN that , but he did n't do it , "" Earl Whitstine VBD . Earl Whitstine VBD his family trapped NNS for extra holiday NN and was in the woods of Grant Parish often . He believes it was this fact that his father was unfairly pegged as a NNP hoaxer . But R.C. Whitstine , 76 , has admitted sawing a footprint out of plywood to VB some tracks . "" We were just having some fun with a JJ saw , "" he told The Town Talk . As for the current rash of sightings , Earl Whitstine and Dubois VBP the NN they saw in the forest was about seven NNS tall , covered in black hair and had JJ NNS . Neither claimed they smelled a foul odor , but a fisherman who RB was VBN to have seen the NN reported it smelled bad . Whitstine claimed he saw the "" booger "" once on Tuesday morning while operating a tree cutter . He VBD the sound of the machine 's bucket startled the NN , and it ran across a nearby creek and off into the woods . "" After it jumped into the NN , it looked back at me , "" Whitstine VBD . That MD not be the last of NNP , he VBD . CD days later , the CD loggers were walking along a property line when they came across the strange NN once again , they VBD . This NN it ran away when Whitstine called to it , they VBD . It was after that sighting that the tracks were discovered in the dry bayou . "" They can VB it was a camel riding an elephant , but I saw what I saw , "" Whitstine VBD . Jackie Dubois , Carl Michael 's father , was RB on the crew that day , and he VBD he has no doubt that his son saw a strange NN . "" I did n't VB to VB it , but I wished I MD 've , but I didn't , "" Jackie Dubois VBD . His son has not changed or embellished his story , although he knows NNS will question their sighting . "" I ain't got nothing to hide , "" Dubois VBD . Delrie , owner of the logging NN , VBD Whitstine and Dubois are very trustworthy and honest NNS who do their job in a professional manner and have been with his NN for a number of NNS . Delrie VBD that when Whitstine told him about the Tuesday sighting he believed him but had to have proof . It was after the sighting on Thursday that the reality of the situation sank in . "" Earl called me up and VBD , ' I need for you to come down here now , ' "" Delrie VBD . "" I noticed a NN in ( Whitstine 's ) voice . "" When he came to the scene and saw the tracks , Delrie VBD , he totally believed that his NNS had seen a strange NN in those woods . "" I looked IN the NN to VB if it was a prank . And that six - and - a- half NN stride ... no NN MD have done that , "" Delrie VBD . Delrie VBD he trusts Whitstine with his expensive logging equipment and that he is lucky to have a solid logging crew working for him . "" The Lord blessed me with them tremendously . You do n't VB what a ( relief ) it is knowing they 're out there doing their job and doing it well , and I 'm not babysitting them , "" Delrie VBD . Delrie VBD his NN has a contract with International Paper and that IP officials are strict about who works for them . "" IP VBD Earl has the No. 1 crew . They love Earl 's crew , "" Delrie VBD . Ward VBD at RB she was n't scared living there RB after hearing about the sightings of the NN . But now that the initial excitement has begun to wear off , she VBD she wo n't be VBG into the woods alone anytime soon . "" I'm a little uneasy , "" she VBD .

Read_VB more_JJR about_IN Dr._NNP Al_NNP Sears_NNP research_NN here_RB","About 58 NNS RB , Eisenhower ended his presidency with his famous “ Farewell Address to the Nation ” … A live broadcast where he warned of the “ unwarranted influence sought by the NN - industrial complex ” – JJ defense firms who leveraged their political connections for profit . And who tapped their NN connections to manufacture enemies and crises – misleading the NNP NN into CD NN after another . Eisenhower ’s warning still rings true today – and the dangers of NNP being dragged into JJ wars … for private profits … still exists . TLB Editors Note : What you are about to read MD put any modern day spy or thriller novel plot to shame … It is almost impossible to conceive … never mind VB . We are talking the NNP of the most powerful nation on the NN vs the most powerful JJ corporate cabal … No not the NNP Industrial Complex … NNP Pharma . Most will never have heard or read what is being presented here . The original article was published almost four NNS RB … its saving grace is its perspective of past events timed in generations , not decades or NNS RB . We will not bias what is presented here with our own views other than to VB … we did feel it important enough to republish it . … but what is presented here stands on its own merit . But , in the final 60 seconds of his farewell address – a segment previously censored until now … Ike issues an ominous SECOND warning … A warning most Americans never heard . The footage of this final segment – and the threat he warns of – has been kept under wraps . Hidden in the archives of a NN building … And what it VBZ was “ off - limits ” to the JJ NN for about 58 NNS . But I ’m breaking this story wide open … naming the JJ NNS … and broadcasting Ike ’s warning to the NN . RB if the powers - that - be come and shut me down … Let the chips fall where they MD … In this last minute – the last NN Eisenhower MD EVER publicly speak – he warned Americans of a far more dangerous threat . CD that MD cost RB more lives , and do RB more damage to NNP . In fact , since Ike ’s final warning , it ’s secretly cost at least 950,000 lives each NN … Lives that MD have been easily saved … And as you ’re about to VB , it MD RB claim Eisenhower himself as its JJ victim … But the mainstream NN censored the final 60 seconds of the famous “ Farewell Address ” … They were actively complicit in the “ cover up ” . I ’ve followed the NN trail to their doorsteps . And my research confirms the NN now receives a whopping $ 27 CD IN NN for keeping this story quiet . That ’s why it ’s remained written out of the textbooks … Banished from the pages of history … Today I ’m blowing the whistle on this secret plot . The details of how it took Eisenhower ’s NN . But RB , let me introduce myself . For the last 30 NNS I ’ve warned my readers about the dangers of the very threat Eisenhower warned of . The threat of the “ JJ industrial complex ” . A group of CD - dollar conglomerates who have literally bought entire departments of the NN … Who manufacture deadly – and highly lucrative – drugs that cost millions of lives each NN . And who have assumed NNP - JJ NN over NNP ’s healthcare NN – and over YOUR NN . You might VB them as NNP Pharma or the NN industry . But you just need to VB CD thing : They VBP $ 2 trillion each NN , NN out of your pocket , for threatening your NN , and that of your family . And they ’ve risen to NNP ’s # 1 industry on a pile of dead bodies . About 58 NNS RB , NNP Eisenhower saw this coming … The NN NNS were just beginning to consolidate and grab NN share during his presidency . And he tried to VB the warning out to the JJ NN – but the NN ultimately blocked his efforts . That ’s why few Americans remember this second warning . A plot that MD ultimately create their most lucrative industry . And they constructed a myth that MD aid in this 54 - NN propaganda NN . It all began with the DEATH of NNP Eisenhower . On September 24 , 1955 , NNP Eisenhower – NNP NNP II hero and beloved NN – was playing golf at his Denver home , when he suddenly collapsed from what was a rare NN at the NN . Although nobody knew it then … and though you wo n’t read about it in any history book … This was a watershed moment that MD VB the course of modern medicine forever . CD that MD VB heart NN the # 1 killer of Americans – and MD establish NNP Pharma as NNP ’s # 1 most profitable industry . The story I ’m unveiling today has HUGE implications for your personal NN , and that of your family . If you or a loved NN has been diagnosed with heart NN , you need to VB the exact details of what took place . Because this story does n’t just tell you WHO is responsible … It tells you WHY . • WHY heart NN rates have soared since 1955 – RB as consumption of “ heart - healthy ” foods and cholesterol - lowering drugs has skyrocketed . • WHY you MD become victim of this NN - induced tragedy – no matter your cholesterol levels or intake of fat . • And 100 CD reasons why NNP Pharma will cure heart NN . That ’s why historian Larry Schweikart calls it “ the single most important JJ NN of the twentieth NN . ” Yet the REAL story behind it is virtually unknown . Within 24 hours of Ike ’s heart attack , special interests seized the opportunity . They shoved this propaganda down the JJ NN ’s throat . And in doing so , they singlehandedly sent NNP ’s NN spiraling downhill for the next six decades . Over the next few minutes , I ’ll expose this near - 60 - NN - JJ NNP Pharma NN . I ’ll name the names . I ’ll track the NN . And at each stage , I ’ll answer the JJ question : “ Who benefits ? ” What ’s more , I ’ll reveal how you can safeguard yourself from heart NN forever with solutions that are 100 percent natural , affordable , effective , and safe . But before I VBP into the details of this story any further — how it spun off the # 1 heart NN lie , ultimately claiming Eisenhower as its JJ victim — let me tell you about … Ike ’s other warning … A warning just as ominous for the JJ NN , if not more so . Near the end of his farewell address to NNP , Ike warned of the “ scientific technological elite . ” These political and scientific insiders were : They were the JJ NN soldiers of the “ JJ - industrial complex . ” A small clique of career - obsessed bureaucrats only interested only in profits . Their research serves as a marketing tool for highly lucrative drugs . But it does nothing to improve JJ NN . Ike saw this NN as the end of scientific discovery and curiosity . You VBP , during NNP NNP II , while then - General Eisenhower was fighting for JJ freedoms … A small group of NN NNS was working against our freedoms . They pulled their strings in NN . By the Eisenhower era , the NN industry was dominated by a handful of conglomerates . A cartel we VBP today as “ NNP Pharma . ” And they were already leveraging NN of scientific research for massive profits . Eisenhower undoubtedly saw this trend . As you ’re about to VB , he RB experienced the results personally . So he knew this MD VB NNP ’s NN in the decades ahead . But this part of Ike ’s address is all but ignored , censored , and “ off - the - record . ” And that ’s unfortunate , because it has mushroomed exponentially since that address . NNS who support “ facts ” for NNP Pharma ’s profit – and their own careers – are putting everyday Americans in imminent danger . That ’s why it ’s imperative you heed Ike ’s warning if you ’re concerned about your own NN , and that of your family . The very JJ victory of this JJ “ scientific technological elite ” took place on September 24 , 1955 – within 24 hours of Ike ’s famous heart attack . It was … RB though 950,000 NNS still die every NN as a direct result … And although these deaths are easily preventable … I doubt CD in 10,000 Americans VBP about September 24 , 1955 . The events on this dark day triggered a six - decade propaganda NN – CD that ’s misled doctors and NNS to … • Focus on the WRONG causes of heart NN … • And instead prescribe dangerous drugs that actually VBP heart problems worse , alongside 300 other deadly side effects . After Eisenhower ’s heart attack , NNP Pharma kicked off their NN of deception . Their JJ relations “ experts ” immediately appeared on TV and told NNP a frightening story . They claimed there was a devastating JJ “ epidemic ” of heart NN . And they blamed excess fat and cholesterol in Americans ’ diets . To confront this “ NN , ” they declared a JJ NN . They labeled ALL fat as evil . Especially saturated fats . In turn , the “ experts ” proposed radical changes to the JJ NN of NN . They recommended that Americans stop smoking . Engage in 30 minutes of cardio each day . And adopt the “ Prudent Diet , ” a low - cholesterol diet consisting of corn NN , margarine , chicken , and cold cereal . What was their real agenda ? And who benefited ? According to the Harvard School of NNP NNP … But in order to VB their JJ agenda stick , they needed somebody famous as a NN for everyday Americans . And who MD fit that bill better than Eisenhower – NN hero and beloved NN ? As you ’re about to VB , they not only made Ike the guinea pig for their hypothesis … They RB VBD the press coverage of Eisenhower ’s recovery as free advertising . Twice each day , for six months , the press covered every aspect of Ike ’s recovery – every medicine and every dietary guideline . They instructed the NN on the dangers of coronary NN . For the JJ NN the word “ cholesterol ” entered the JJ vocabulary . They portrayed cholesterol as the “ JJ polio . ” Millions of Americans – frightened by the JJ “ epidemic ” – quickly embraced any solutions the so - called “ experts ” handed out . When the dust settled , Americans had learned to watch the fat and cholesterol in their diets . But there was CD JJ problem with all of this … None of it was true . Not a single word of it . In fact , later research MD confirm these fats have plenty of proven NN benefits , including preventing and reversing heart NN ! But once “ facts ” IN these are born , they never seem to die . No matter the research or studies that disprove them . Not when so much NN is at stake . You VBP , this myth not only gave birth to poor dietary guidelines … It RB spawned the most lucrative class of drugs ever invented . That includes the most lucrative ( and deadliest ) NN VBN to mankind . NNS to date from this NN alone have totaled a whopping $ 140 CD ! And this # 1 cash cow hinges on this CD single myth . That ’s why it will NOT VB away so easily . Your own NN likely still believes it . But I VBP you ’ll be surprised at just how little research there is to back it . In a minute , you ’ll hear all the details on how Ike was its JJ victim . But RB , let me expose how they VBD Eisenhower ’s own NN to administer their poison . Although top NNS and NNS were rallying behind the JJ myth … There was CD detractor : In fact , he publicly debunked it on a live broadcast in a panel debate with his peers . RB with NO JJ research , studies , or NNS to support the cholesterol hypothesis … Dr. White reversed his position , and jumped on the bandwagon for the sake of his own career . Is it a coincidence Eisenhower ’s own NN was the perfect example of the “ scientific - technological elite ” ? I ’ll leave that for you to decide . You VBP , this diet had POWERFUL backers from NNP Pharma and NNP Agriculture . IN Procter & Gamble , with billions of dollars on the table selling vegetable oils in place of fat - heavy cooking . P&G ’s funding RB helped transform the NNP Heart Association into a powerhouse organization . In fact , the AHA ’s most avid proponent of the “ lipid NN , ” Fred Mattson , was a scientist ( and shill ) for Procter & Gamble . Mattson RB helped P&G develop Olestra , a cholesterol - free replacement for fat in foods and cooking oils . And in 1958 , CD NNS after Eisenhower ’s heart attack , Kraft introduced polyunsaturated margarine to the NN . A product they advertised as a “ heart healthy ” alternative to butter . With this kind of NN at stake , the increasingly powerful NN and food conglomerates were n’t taking any chances . That ’s why they hired leading JJ experts to tout the JJ party line . Today , NN NNS STILL recruit “ key opinion leaders ” as hired guns for their marketing campaigns . These top physicians endorse NNP Pharma ’s drugs . In return , they achieve celebrity status and popularity . And they enforce NNP Pharma ’s ideas in the JJ community . That includes ostracizing and blacklisting doctors who buck the status quo . These mouthpieces for NNP Pharma embody the very “ scientific technological elite ” that Eisenhower warned of . Dr. White emerged as CD of these leaders in the 1950s . That ’s why he MD not only VB along with the JJ dogma … And aiding in the corruption of JJ knowledge … But MD RB turn RB and prescribe this very same diet to Ike . Thanks to this single move , the link between cholesterol and heart NN became “ gospel . ” Yet not a shred of research supported it . No studies , no NNS , nothing . Americans swallowed the propaganda IN an overpriced pill . Everyone now “ knew ” the “ evils ” of fat and cholesterol in their diets . Ironically , Eisenhower ’s own condition – VBN by NNP Pharma to push their agenda – 100 percent contradicted the “ cholesterol myth . ” At the NN of his heart attack , Eisenhower ’s cholesterol was ONLY 165 mg/dL . Ike RB exercised every day and kept a perfect weight of 172 . In other words , he seemed to be in perfect condition . And Ike ’s NN was hardly unusual . According to a published analysis of the Framingham Heart NNP … 75 percent of patients admitted to the hospital for heart attacks have normal cholesterol levels . In short , cholesterol is a terrible predictor of heart NN . That should have been the lesson . The end of the story . But Americans did n’t hear about this from the NN . All they heard was Eisenhower ’s JJ cholesterol - free diet . Ike replaced butter with hydrogenated soybean oils and margarine full of dangerous trans fat . He no longer ate eggs , bacon , and steak for breakfast . And over NN , at the insistence of Dr. White , his diet regimen grew stricter . In fact , some days he MD eat nothing but grapefruit and melba toast . And as a result , Americans jumped on board the JJ “ heart healthy ” diet fad . But this diet came with dire consequences for Ike ’s NN , mind , and NN . The same suffering millions of Americans MD experience over the next 59 NNS . According to the Harvard School of NNP NNP , back in the 1960s when Americans consumed more fat , the rate of obesity was 13 percent and only CD percent suffered from type 2 diabetes . Today , although we consume MUCH less fat in our diets , the rate of obesity has soared as high as 45 percent and 8 percent now suffer from type 2 diabetes . This is from Harvard NNP – MD you VB of a more reliable source ? “ The low - fat diet has n’t helped us VB weight or become healthier . ” NNP Eisenhower ’s own experience is a NN in point . After Ike began following this “ heart - healthy ” diet , his cholesterol levels soared . They jumped from 165 … to 195 … to 225 … to 259 mg/dL . The NN grew increasingly frustrated , RB obsessed with his cholesterol . At CD point he RB checked his levels 10 times each NN . The more his cholesterol soared , the more religiously Ike stuck to the diet . A fact that dumbfounded his NN of top physicians and enraged the NN . It got so bad the NN ’s doctors RB started lying to him about his real levels . Yet this did n’t stop the “ experts ” from continuing to push this mythology . Six days before Ike ’s cholesterol level reached 259 , Ancel Keys – a protégé of Eisenhower ’s NN – published his famous “ 7 NNS NN . ” In fact , Dr. Paul Dudley White helped Keys secure NN funding for the NN . It championed the same cholesterol - free diet that Eisenhower personally knew was JJ . And it established the “ lipid hypothesis ” as accepted “ fact . ” But here ’s what no NN knew at the NN : Ancel Keys “ cherry picked ” the evidence so he MD associate heart NN with fat and cholesterol intake . Keys studied 22 NNS , but only focused on the 6 NNS which supported his thesis . The 16 other NNS actually disproved his entire idea … but he left them out . There ’s a word for this kind of research – propaganda . Nevertheless , the JJ NN rallied IN his NN . Keys ended up on the cover of NNP Magazine . CD weeks later , the NNP Heart Association officially adopted the cholesterol NN of heart NN . Pretty soon , it became the accepted wisdom throughout the JJ field . Lowering LDL ( “ bad ” ) cholesterol was now the primary focus of preventive medicine . The ironic part is , Eisenhower was experiencing firsthand just how wrong this NN was … and paying for it with his NN and NN . Throughout the 1960s , Eisenhower suffered seven heart attacks and 14 myocardial infarctions … RB as he stuck religiously to the “ heart - healthy diet . ” In 1969 , the famous NN hero and beloved NN died from his last heart attack . In circles today , it ’s VBN as the “ Eisenhower Paradox . ” And while this is only a single anecdotal piece of evidence … The So - Called “ Eisenhower Paradox ” Is Killing Millions of Average Americans The JJ establishment is still force - feeding us the same myth that ultimately killed Eisenhower . Remember : the conventional wisdom is that LDL cholesterol causes arterial plaque buildup , ultimately obstructing our NN flow and leading to heart NN . You ’ve heard it . I heard it repeated from elementary to JJ school . And IN my colleagues , I believed it without question . That is , until I read thousands of studies proving otherwise . Yes , LDL cholesterol can be VBN in the plaque that builds up along damaged arteries . But this point misses a simple fact – CD RB a high school physiology course MD tell you … The damage to your arteries happens before NOT after the plaque builds up . Plaque is your NN ’s response to heart NN , not the NN of it . LDL cholesterol catches blame because it ’s VBN at the scene of the crime . But that ’s a lot IN blaming a scab for the injury that caused it to form … or IN blaming a band - aid for the injury its covering . The NN is that the REAL culprit for heart NN has always been inflammation . And the worst part is … the inflammation in our NN vessels is caused in part by the low - fat diet recommended for NNS by modern medicine . That ’s why Eisenhower ’s heart NN grew worse , RB on his “ heart - healthy ” diet … which replaced so - called “ artery - clogging ” butter with toxic vegetable oils . And that ’s why 950,000 Americans continue to die each NN from heart NN , RB as they consume record quantities of low - fat food , vegetable oils , and cholesterol - lowering drugs . In fact , the NN about inflammation is JJ NN . But the JJ establishment still ignores it . RB when the mainstream NN occasionally gets it JJ . For instance , a 2004 NNP Magazine cover story identified inflammation as the “ secret killer . ” Take a look at the cover … The NN article starts with a description of the conventional explanation of heart NN . Then the writer quickly shuts it down … . But I was stunned that this blunt article actually reached the mainstream . Of course , this was more than 10 NNS RB . And in spite of the attention generated by this article , the NN for cholesterol - lowering drugs to counteract heart NN has skyrocketed five - fold since then . In short , there ’s nothing stopping NNP Pharma ’s relentless march for profits … no amount of evidence … no matter how airtight … RB from a prestigious source IN NNP Magazine . Their profit margins VBP proof . And it certainly trumps your NN and your NN . You do n’t have to fall victim to their mass guinea pig experiment . I ’ve identified three urgent indicators of heart NN you can check with a simple NN test . These tests indicate ( with startling accuracy ) that you MD be at imminent NN of a heart attack or stroke . In fact , CD of these indicators can predict when that NN MD jump by as much as 500 percent . A review of 26 articles , published in the Journal of Biotechnology Information , proved RB a very tiny increase in levels – 5 mcg – confirms a 20 percent increase in heart NN NN … independent of ANY other factors for heart NN . And I can speak from personal experience as a physician . Read more about Dr. NNP Sears research here"

A JJ NN proposes that the ' original NNP ' was a 10 - NN tall ape that roamed the NNP CD CD NNS RB . Archaeological evidence of the NN has been VBN in southeastern China . It is being referred to as Gigantopithecus blacki or G. blacki for short . It 's being likened to modern - day orangutans . The NNS VBD that G. Blacki is actually related to orangutans by conducting a JJ kind of NN analysis on some of the tooth enamel from fossilised remains . NN co-author Enrico Cappellini explained : "" By sequencing proteins retrieved from dental enamel about 2 CD NNS JJ , we showed it is possible to confidently reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of NN NNS that went extinct too far away in NN for their DNA to survive till now . "" In this NN , we can RB conclude that the lineages of orangutan and Gigantopithecus split up about 12 CD NNS RB . "" The NNS have worked out that G. blacki likely weighed up to 595 pounds and diverged from orangutans IN 12 CD NNS RB . However , it 's not thought to be closely related to NNS . The NN 's lead author Frido Welker VBD : "" With this NN , we show that we can VB NN sequencing to retrieve ancient genetic information from primates living in subtropical areas RB when the fossil is CD CD NNS JJ . "" Until now , it has only been possible to retrieve genetic information from up to 10,000 - NN - JJ fossils in warm , humid areas . "" This is interesting , because ancient remains of the supposed ancestors of our NNS , Homo sapiens , are RB mainly VBN in subtropical areas , particularly for the early part of JJ evolution . "" This means that we can potentially retrieve similar information on the evolutionary line leading to NNS . "" Fossils of the ' original NN ' are very rare and only four parital jaws have ever been VBN . However , thousands of teeth have been discovered . We do n't VB for sure what G. blacki MD have looked IN but some artistic impressions depict the NNS as an oversized orangutan . This NN has been published in the scientific journal Nature . In other archaeology NN , Hitler 's secret vegetable garden has been uncovered at a Poland bunker . Gold dentures with ' hippo ivory ' teeth will be auctioned later this month after being dug up in a field near Oxford . And , the face of a 1,000 - NN - JJ Viking warrior woman with a gruesome battle wound across her skull has been revealed . What do you VB of this JJ ape ? Let us VB in the comments ...

"" What 's important here is the arch , "" Lovejoy VBZ . "" It 's a RB important shock absorber . It 's IN wearing a good pair of running NNS . "" In order to create that arch , the chimp 's opposable great NN became aligned with the others , and the NN 's muscles and ligaments , which had been VBN for grasping and climbing , were repositioned under the NN . "" The NN of the JJ NN is indicative of this . You can VB it in Lucy 's NN , "" Lovejoy VBZ , but not in the bone Haile - Selassie VBD , because it 's from a different NN . "" What we can VB [ in the JJ discovery 's NN ] is that the base of the bone adjacent to the knuckle has a distinct angle , showing that the NN walked step after step after step with its heel off the ground , using the front of its NN as a platform . "" That 's how it walked . Why it walked is tougher to understand , since motivation leaves behind no physical remains . But armed with knowledge about our ancestors ' physical attributes and the environment that surrounded them , NNS have come up with several NNS . Anthropologist Henry McHenry , of the NNP of California , Davis , for example , champions the idea that NN variation was part of the picture after all . When Africa dried out , VB McHenry and his colleague Peter Rodman , the NN left patches of forest widely spaced between open savannah . The JJ hominids lived mostly in these forest refuges but MD n't find enough food in any CD place . Learning to walk on CD legs helped them travel JJ distances over ground to the next woodsy patch , and thus to more food . Meave Leakey , head of paleontology at the National Museums of Kenya and a member of the NN 's most famous fossil - hunting family , suspects the NN in NN rewarded bipedalism for a different reason . Yes , the dryer NN made for more grassland , but our early ancestors , she argues , spent much of their NN not in dense forest or on the savannah but in an environment with some trees , dense shrubbery and a bit of grass . "" And if you 're moving into more open NN with grasslands and bushes and things IN this , and eating a lot of fruits and berries coming off low bushes , there is a hell of an advantage to be able to reach higher . That 's why the gerenuk [ a type of antelope ] evolved its JJ neck and stands on its hind legs , and why the giraffe evolved its JJ neck . There 's strong pressure to be able to reach a wider range of levels . "" But for Kent NNP 's Lovejoy , the real answer is sex . Males who were best at walking upright MD VB more of it , leading to more offspring who were good on CD legs , who in turn got more sex . His reasoning , RB proposed nearly CD decades RB , goes IN this : IN JJ modern Americans , monkeys and apes of both genders work outside the home -- in the latter NN , searching for food . Early NNS , though , discovered the Leave It to Beaver strategy : if males handled the breadwinning , females MD stay closer to home and devote more NN to rearing the NNS , thus giving them a better shot at growing up strong and healthy ."

The excitement was spurred by the Australian NN ’s recent release of a list of alleged Tasmanian tiger sightings from the past three NNS . For Forrest Galante , this is an NN he has been thinking about for NNS . The biologist turned adventurer is the star of NNP NNP ’s Extinct or Alive , a nature show that seeks out NNS that NN has proclaimed extinct . “ I spent three months in the Australian bush looking for it , I have faith in that NN ’s existence , ” Galante tells NNP . And RB though those three months did n’t turn up a Tasmanian Tiger , RB VBN as a thylacine , he has n’t “ given up hope yet ” that the NN is out there . Galante ’s opinion is CD to be trusted , he and the Extinct or Alive crew have already uncovered NNS that the NN literally left for dead , including the rediscovery of the Fernandina NNP Tortoise . “ We find CD of these NNS and it ’s NN - shattering . It rewrites natural history , ” Galante VBZ adding that he sees each of Extinct or Alive ‘s rediscoveries as an “ accomplishment for the NN of conservation . ” “ The fact that these NNS are able to hang on by a thread when the whole NN has given up on them — I am getting goosebumps , ” he VBZ of the feeling he gets holding an NN in his hands that the NN thought was extinct . Galante , the son of safari owners , has spent his whole NN IN wildlife and , after becoming a biologist , decided to share his excitement about his work through NN . This is how Extinct or Alive was born . The show follows Galante through wild and remote locations in search of NNS that are thought to be extinct . The job is anything but guess work . Each episode consists of NNS of research , months of planning and weeks of field works . Galante VBZ he receives at least 100 messages a week from fans and fellow NN lovers with tips , sightings and requests to search for certain NNS , NNP NNP included . And while Galante does n’t seek out cryptids IN NNP NNP , he does read and log every message he gets , just in NN any can bring him a step closer to uncovering an NN the NN has forgotten . RB after all this work and preparation , there are still plenty of trips when all the effort does n’t lead to a rediscovery , but Galante does n’t consider these adventures to be failures . “ We VBP a very family friendly show . We do n’t always find the NN , but we do find amazing habitats and other amazing NNS , ” he VBZ . “ NNS can enjoy the adventure and all the beautiful creatures along the NN . ” Viewers can RB enjoy missing out on the unique pains Galante and his NN endure while out in the field searching for extinct NNS . According to Galante , while working on the show , he has gotten VBN to getting 45 bee stings a day , been bitten by a shark , worked in 122 degree weather near an active volcano , spent days in darkness and gone into anaphylactic shock from a wasp sting . To him it is all worth it , but he understands if there are NNS at home who prefer to assist in conservation in a different NN . “ Conservation starts at home . Wildlife is all IN us , ” Galante VBZ . To those who are inspired by what he does , but are n’t looking for a shark bite , he advises joining a conservation group in your area , volunteering at a local rescue or donating to nonprofits that VBP protect our NN and its NNS ."

According to podiatrist Margaret Dabbs , the Queen of NNS who counts Graham Norton , Ozwald Boateng , and numerous City highflyers as clients , JJ NNS feel self - conscious about the appearance of their NNS , insecurity that is only made worse by the current trend for sandals and open - toed NNS . “ They try to hide their NNS away ; they do n’t realise there are always ways to improve the situation through NN and exercise , ” she VBZ . Our NNS end up being a neglected part of our NN but we should all be giving them more attention , Dabbs maintains . Evidence suggests that in some NNS NNP - CD presents itself on the NNS ; GPs are allegedly overrun with concerns about “ NN NN ” ; red blotches and lesions on the NNS and NNS that are thought to be another side effect of the NN . “ The rash seems to resemble pernio erythema or chilblains and is presumably related to NN in NN temperature , ” Dabbs VBZ . “ Viral conditions often affect the extremities and that can include NNS . ” Our isolated lifestyle is RB playing havoc with our NNS . With gyms closed and JJ of our daily commutes cancelled , we are more static than usual , leaving us at NN of painful conditions such as Plantar fasciitis , which can stem from inactivity , Dabb VBZ . Others , meanwhile , have become mad runners , haring off on the 5 Km Run for Heroes with precious little training . According to Dabbs , extreme exercise without giving any thought to our NNS can result in thickened NN , flattened arches , stress fractures and Achilles tendonitis . The easiest NN to start noticing our NNS is to strip off our NNS and socks , VBZ postural alignment therapist , Ellie Burt , and walk RB on them . “ It ’s no good working out our bodies without thinking about our NNS , ” she VBZ . “ The NN muscles might be tiny but they are crucial to a fully functioning , NN - free NN ; some muscles such as the Gastrocnemius start at the NN and span all the NN up behind the knee . ” This enforced rest from heeled work NNS is an ideal opportunity to give our NNS a chance to recover and wake up , she continues . Heels and indeed any shoe including trainers that tilts our ankles downwards , throw off the biomechanics of the entire NN , and load our NNS unnaturally , causing problems in joints further up the NN . Do n’t be tempted to ditch your trainers entirely , though , warns Dabbs . If you ’re a perpetual heel wearer IN Meghan , you should gradually build up the NN you spend barefoot or VBP ending up with Achilles tendonitis . It ’s RB a good idea to introduce some barefoot exercises ; for those with JJ NNS , Dabbs ’ son James Dabbs , a personal trainer who runs JJ fitness classes to strengthen the NN as well as the rest of the NN , suggests introducing exercises that work on raising , strengthening and lengthening the arches –stair arch raises , calf raises , arch lifts and tennis ball rolls . Pregnancy , ageing , footwear , gait and genetics can all contribute to JJ NNS , he VBZ , but with regular exercise , you can strengthen your arches and reduce NN in other joints ."

DAMASCUS , SYRIA — The NNP NNPS NN has rejected offers to resolve the growing humanitarian NN in the Rukban refugee camp in Syria , which sits inside a 55 km zone occupied by the U.S. along the Syria - Jordan border . The U.S. has RB refused to let any of the estimated 40,000 refugees — the majority of which are NNS and NNS — leave the camp voluntarily , RB though NNS are dying in droves from lack of food , adequate shelter and JJ care . The U.S. has RB not provided humanitarian aid to the camp RB though a U.S. JJ base is located just 20 km ( 12.4 NNS ) away . The growing desperation inside the Rukban camp has received sparse NN coverage , likely because of the U.S. ’ NN over the area in which the camp is located . The U.S. has been accused of refusing to let civilians leave the area — RB though nearly all have expressed a desire to either return to Syrian NN - held territory or seek refuge in neighboring NNS such as Turkey — because the camp ’s presence helps to justify the U.S. ’ illegal occupation of the area . Though the U.S. has RB justified its presence in NNP - Tanf as necessary to defeat Daesh ( ISIS ) , the U.S. NN has RB acknowledged that NNP - Tanf ’s true strategic importance lies in U.S. efforts to “ contain ” Iran by blocking a connection from Iran to Syria through Iraq . NNP - Tanf lies near the area where the borders of Syria , Iraq and Jordan meet . Thus , in the U.S. ’ NN of brinkmanship with Iran , Rukban ’s estimated 40,000 inhabitants have become pawns whose basic needs are ignored by their occupiers . U.S. shows no interest in meeting On Tuesday , delegations from NNP , Syria , the UN , and the Rukban refugee camp met to discuss the fate of the camp ’s inhabitants after a UN survey VBD that 95 percent of the camp ’s inhabitants wanted to leave the camp , while 83 percent wanted to return to their hometowns in areas of Syria now under Syrian NN NN . However , the U.S. NN and NNP Department officials in nearby Jordan rejected an invitation to Tuesday ’s meeting . The U.S. NN RB prohibited a Syrian - Russian delegation from entering the Rukban camp on Tuesday . The delegation had sought to assess conditions in the camp , which have become increasingly desperate according to reports from a variety of outlets , including U.S. NN - funded outlets IN Voice of NNP . The U.S. ’ refusal to attend the meeting or allow the delegation passage comes less than a month after the U.S. NN blocked the entry of evacuation buses overseen by Russian and Syrian forces that MD have allowed refugees to leave the camp . The buses MD have entered through the “ humanitarian corridors ” that were recently opened on the Syrian - controlled side of the U.S. - occupied enclave . While camp inhabitants can , in NN , leave the camp through the corridors on NN , the barren area ’s remoteness makes such evacuations unfeasible without vehicle transport . Although some families have left this NN , the lack of record keeping within the camp has made it impossible to VB how JJ have tried leaving this NN since the corridors were opened last month . An often overlooked problem that has prevented them from leaving is that U.S. - backed and U.S. - trained “ moderate rebel ” groups have been VBN to block camp inhabitants from leaving , demanding JJ payments in U.S. dollars to leave the area . The U.S. NN took NN of NNP - Tanf alongside “ moderate ” rebel forces in 2014 after wresting the area from Daesh . JJ of those opposition groups have since been revealed to have ties and sympathies to terrorist groups , including Daesh . The U.S. has not given a reason for its rejection of Tuesday ’s meeting and had previously VBN that its rejection of the evacuation buses was VBN on its view that the buses did not meet the U.S. ’ “ protection standards . ” While the U.S. has claimed that it has blocked refugees from leaving on Russian - Syrian buses are under U.S. “ protection , ” it has done little to abet the suffering of the tens of thousands of civilians in Rukban , RB though the area is under complete U.S. JJ NN and a U.S. JJ base is just a few NNS away . Indeed , the extent of U.S. “ aid ” to the Rukban camp has been JJ training of the handful of nurses in the camp , who work in conditions they describe as being IN “ the Stone Age ” owing to the chronic lack of basic medications and doctors . While JJ care is decidedly lacking , the most pressing problem is the access to food , as starvation has become a real threat for those living in Rukban . Last October the opposition - aligned NN service , the Syrian Observatory for NNP Rights ( SOHR ) , reported that the Rukban camp had been without food or essential supplies for months . Only CD aid deliveries , managed jointly by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent ( SARC ) and the UN , were able to enter the camp . CD of those shipments , however , almost did n’t happen after the UN delayed the aid “ for logistical and security reasons . ” While the UN did not specify which “ security reasons ” had prompted the delay , it was apparently not the Syrian NN , as the UN RB VBD in the same statement that the convoy had received approval from Damascus . This suggests that the “ security ” concerns were related to U.S. - backed militants in the U.S. - controlled area surrounding NNP - Tanf . Notably , Russian and Syrian sources have claimed that these same militants often “ plunder ” the aid intended for the camp ’s inhabitants for themselves . Since then , the situation inside the camp has continued to deteriorate . Indeed , things have gotten so desperate that , in January , a mother attempted to set herself and her three NNS on fire after she MD n’t find food for three straight days and preferred to give her NNS a quick death rather than watch them starve . Others in the camp rescued the family , though the mother and her infant were seriously injured . Recently aid from the UN and SARC arrived in early February , the JJ aid shipment in over three months . The lack of food combined with the lack of JJ care has been responsible for scores of deaths in the camp — the majority of which are of NNS under the age of CD , who often die from malnutrition and preventable NNS . Others have died from freezing weather owing to a lack of adequate shelter , with eight NNS dying in January for that very reason . Satellite images taken of the camp in early March showed the recent creation of a mass grave containing an estimated 300 bodies adjacent to the camp . Despite the desperate conditions less than 13 NNS from its JJ base , the U.S. has declined to send food , doctors , JJ supplies or other forms of aid to Rukban ’s inhabitants , while RB preventing them from leaving . However , the U.S. has been providing militant groups in the same area with JJ and logistical support . In addition to presiding over the squalid and starvation conditions in the Rukban camp , the U.S. has RB given militant groups present in the area it controls — including Daesh terrorists who have “ embedded ” themselves in the camp on the U.S. ’ watch — free rein to terrorize the camp ’s refugees . These militant groups not only VB the flow of food and aid in the camp but terrorize its most vulnerable inhabitants , forcing NNS and NNS into sex slavery and engaging in JJ trafficking . All of this is taking place in a “ deconfliction zone ” controlled by the U.S. NN . These extremist groups , including Daesh , are well - armed , according to Jordanian Brigadier General Sami Kafawin , who told NBC NNP in CD that these groups “ have whole weapons systems … small arms , RPGs , anti-aircraft . ” The official reason for the U.S. base in NNP - Tanf has RB been counterterrorism operations that ostensibly target Daesh . However , very few attacks against the terror group have been launched from this base and a UN report released last August VBD that Daesh had been given “ breathing NN ” in U.S. - occupied areas of Syria , including NNP - Tanf . The U.S. has stated that it uses the NNP - Tanf base to train Syrian opposition fighters who then VBP the area IN the base , including Rukban . With the U.S. now having claimed that Daesh has been completely defeated in Syria , the official justification for its illegal occupation of Syrian territory is wearing thin . With that justification now on shaky ground , the U.S. is increasingly having to acknowledge its main motive for its presence in NNP - Tanf — containing Iran and keeping Syria divided . Indeed , a recent Reuters article notes that the U.S. - controlled area IN NNP - Tanf that includes the Rukban camp “ is designed to shield U.S. troops at the Tanf garrison and maintain for Washington a strategic foothold in an area close to a crucial supply route for Iranian weapons entering Syria from Iraq . ” This was confirmed by General Joseph Votel late last NN when he told NBC NNP that the U.S. base in NNP - Tanf was key in countering “ the sway of Iran ” in Syria . This followed statements made last July by National Security Advisor John Bolton that U.S. troops MD remain in Syria “ as RB as the Iranian menace continues throughout the Middle East . ” This policy of Iran containment has clearly guided U.S. policy in Syria of late , with at least 1,000 U.S. troops set to stay in Syria illegally despite Daesh ’s defeat and NNP Donald NNP ’s recent calls for a troop withdrawal . The U.S. has been accused of using the civilians trapped in Rukban as a “ shield ” for its continued operations in Syria aimed at containing Iran ’s regional influence . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov VBD earlier this month that “ the fact that NNS are not allowed to leave [ the camp ] and are held hostage makes CD suggest that the U.S. needs this camp to continue justifying its illegitimate presence there . ” There appear to be few other explanations for the U.S. ’ refusal to let camp inhabitants leave the area . The hypocrisy of U.S. “ humanitarian concerns ” The situation in the Rukban camp reveals the dark reality behind the U.S. ’ occupation of Syrian territory in NNP - Tanf and elsewhere . In order to pursue its policy of Iran “ containment ” and a divided and partitioned Syria , the U.S. is willing to imprison some 40,000 NNS — JJ of them NNS — in a concentration camp where international aid is blocked and where food is so scarce that mothers are setting themselves and their NNS on fire so they can avoid slowly starving to death . According to the Cambridge Dictionary , a concentration camp is defined as “ a place where JJ numbers of NNS are kept as prisoners in extremely bad conditions , especially for political reasons . ” It is undeniable that the Rukban camp fits this definition to the letter . That the U.S. justifies its aggressive policies IN the NN — from Syria to Venezuela and elsewhere — as being motivated by “ humanitarian concerns ” — when a refugee camp under the U.S. ’ complete NN in Syria is facing starvation conditions and its inhabitants are being forcefully kept confined in the camp by the U.S. NN despite their expressed desire to leave — is an obscene Orwellian twist . All this to “ contain ” Iranian influence in the Middle East . Top photo | The unofficial Rukban camp for displaced Syrians , between the Jordan and Syria borders , Feb. 14 , CD .

Is it about making NNP great again , or for a Greater Israel ?

[_-LRB- 13_CD ]_-RRB-","Finding NNP is an JJ television series on NNP NNP . It premiered on NNP 29 , 2011 . The program follows four NNS and explorers investigating potential evidence of NNP , a cryptid hominid allegedly living in the wildernesses of the NNP NNPS and Canada . While the Finding NNP NN never captured photographic evidence of the NN 's existence , the show gained high ratings and was a top earner for NNP NNP . The series finale and the 100th episode was released on NNP 27 , 2018 . The NN consists of NNP Field NNPS Organization ( BFRO ) founder and NNP Matt Moneymaker , NNS James "" Bobo "" Fay and Cliff Barackman , and skeptical scientist Ranae Holland . The series never questions the existence of NN , but rather documents the NN 's search efforts and NN of potential evidence in an attempt to prove the existence of the NN . Over the course of the series , the NN has introduced JJ JJ NN related terms into the JJ vernacular . For example , the term "" NN "" is rarely VBN in favor of "" squatch "" ( short for NN ) . Their investigations are referred to as "" squatchin' "" . The areas they investigate are often described as "" Squatchy "" , with Washington having been described as "" the squatchiest NN . "" An episode begins with the Finding NNP NN driving to a location on the trail of photographic , NN , audio , or eyewitness evidence of a NNP . The NN will VB to the location where the evidence was gathered from , and speak to the NN who gathered the evidence . If it is a photograph or a NN , the NN will perform a recreation and a size comparison of the event , using the same camera that the witness VBD . The NN then performs their JJ night investigation at that same location . Starting with the second NN , CD member of the NN will almost always remain at the location for a solo night investigation for several more nights . The other three ( or four in the JJ NN ) members will then head to a ' town hall meeting ' to which members of the NN are invited to come and share their NNP encounter stories . In some heavily NNP reported areas , such as Washington , these events are sometimes invite only . After the witnesses tell their encounter stories , they are asked to mark their sighting locations on a map , which the NN then uses to look for a pattern of sightings . The NN will then visit three of the best - reported encounters , that are RB close to CD another . After visiting all three witnesses , the NN will collect the member who was doing the solo night investigation and select an area to do their final night investigation . For the final night investigation , the NN RB devises a unique plan to try to attract a NNP , RB involving noise or light , by using boats on a lake , or silent electric ATVs . They RB do wood knocks , which mimics the NN 's supposed communication . Night - vision technology and forward looking infrared ( FLIR ) cameras are VBN to document these investigations . They will then evaluate what they learned and announce their evaluations during the ending credits . Occasionally , they will show their trail cam pictures or DNA results following the credits / summary . In the third NN , the NN expanded their search from NNP NNP to investigate the NNP phenomenon VBN as "" yowies "" in NNP . Later in the NN , they traveled to Indonesia searching for the "" orang pendek "" , and to Vietnam to search for the "" wildman "" . [ 7 ] In NN four , the NN traveled to China in search of the "" yeren "" , and Nepal in search of the "" yeti "" . In later seasons , the NN traveled to other NNS , including the NNP Kingdom and Brazil . NN 5 of Finding NNP debuted on June 8 , 2014 , as opposed to November when the last CD seasons started . On October 20 , CD , the Finding NNP cast and crew revisited California to attend the 50th anniversary festival while filming the 100th episode of the show . On NNP 27 , 2018 , the 100th and finale episode was released on NNP NNP . It was entitled "" Return of the Legend "" . NNP NNP has received criticism for Finding NNP and Mermaids : The NNP VBN [ 8 ] for their "" outlandishness "" , however , Fay is quick to defend Finding NNP , and to draw a line between the CD programs . "" You ca n't equate NN with mermaids . "" [ 9 ] Several episodes of the JJ NN received heavy criticism from the four ' Finding NNP ' members themselves , for the editing style that NNP NNP VBD , to VB it appear that a horse and a NN were unidentified by the NN , and what they were remained unknown . The second event , involving the horse , led the NN to threaten to quit the show if such techniques were VBN again . [ 10 ] Regardless , Finding NNP is CD of NNP NNP 's top rated programs . [ 11 ] It has spawned CD spin- offs : Finding NNP : Further Evidence and Finding NNP : Rejected Evidence . Finding NNP : Further Evidence is similar to VH - 1's Pop - Up NN . Episodes of Finding NNP are re-aired with "" info nuggets "" from the NN members . Finding NNP : Rejected Evidence is an JJ - only series , in which executive producer Keith Hoffman airs NN deemed not worthy of inclusion on the show . [ 12 ] NNP enthusiasts have often ridiculed the show , due to the NN 's consistent lack of success , and the fact that any footage of a NNP MD be reported RB before an episode airs . [ 13 ]"

I¹ve just been on the morphine for kidney stones , so I¹ll claim that as cover . HALLETT'S EXPERIENCE I had similar training to Creighton / Ainsworth - Davis with the Black Angel / Anubis . Mine RB started IN 14 /15 . At 18 , while at NNP , I was fully NN - jumped ( 1980 ) and by 1983 , I was NN - jump capable . Some of the horrific training occurs naturally under Anubis . The most information inserted at the deepest level in the quickest NN is done through the most intense fear . I call this ' internal terror¹ . The five minutes I spent battling with Anubis over possession of my NN was cover for an internal download . These downloads , which Creighton RB had , work on the subconscious level . . . meaning you attract everything you need to achieve those goals . That includes the training , the trainers , the support crew , the opportunities , the job as cover , the transport and accommodation and the chance meetings . It RB means that you can act as an independent and run your own constructs ( frame of reference ) . That means you don¹t need to report back to a controller or ultimately rely on another crew . As it turned out , the reconstruction of the subconscious was CD of the most valuable things to come out of the Cold NNP . It was something we ultimately had delivered from Moscow . Just as Creighton¹s role was getting the US into WWII with Pearl Harbor , and getting Bormann out of Berlin , my role , with similar experiences , was finishing Creighton / Ainsworth¹s story with the escape of Hitler out of Berlin with the attached Operation Winnie the Pooh . . . and dropping the Berlin Wall . MARKUS WOLFE Anubis is ' NN with Wolfe¹s head ' ­ hence Mark as Wolfe¹ ' Marcus Wolfe ' ­- the head of the STASI . He was very easy to VB jump . Just look at the photos of him IN 21 -- very open . Anyway , we spent RB a NN setting it up . I got into the Ivy NNP NNP on the reincarnation ticket in Boston and they took care of contacts , accommodation and transport . I made some KGB contacts and I was skipping between Checkpoint Charlie between the CD groups . Somehow we managed to arrange : 1 . A prostitute ( Russian ) ; 2. Lots of Alcohol ; 3 . NN - jump ; 4 . Construct , or Frame of reference . These are kind of IN secret formulasfor the subconscious , IN the parallel program , the main program , thesabotage program and the homeopathic program . These are the sort of things I¹d explain to Carl Jung . Part of the construct we VBD included me skippingthrough Checkpoint Charlie at exactly midnight the NN before the wall camedown , UH on 8/9 November 1988 . So a NN later , Marcus Wolfe tells his wife he¹s VBG out of town on abusiness trip for a week , but he stayed in Berlin with this JJ mistress andgets RB drunk , standing RB bragging in his underwear . His JJ wifewas RB his mistress , so he had a weakness here . He¹s been at it for a few days , and he¹s IN butter . There¹s some pressureat the NNS to open them for NNS from East to West , so the guard ringsup and asks for Marcus , then VBZ , no , where Marcus is , not where he¹s not , at his relaxing place . The guard gets put through to Marcus Wolfe and briefshim on the situation , on the pressure at the NNS and they discuss opening the dog NNS to VB the dogs to scatter the NNS . Marcus Wolfe goes back to drinking and ruling the Berlin Wall in hisunderwear , then there¹s a NN of guard at the Berlin Wall . The JJ guard rings up and VBZ to Marcus Wolfe : ³ There is pressure at thegates² [ NN - jump ] . Marcus Wolfe replies : ³ Open the gates² [ NN - jump ] . Marcus thinks he means the dog NNS . The guard thinks he means the humangates , so the guard opens up the Berlin Wall , and the rest is history . . .. . . thank you very much . . . We RB did a whole lot of other stuff you didn¹t VB . Some of it you bestdon¹t¹ VB . Most of it , when mentioned , has to VB through the whole longphase of ridicule before it¹s finally accepted . . . but you ¹re all livingin it . Marcus Wolfe was then announced as dying 17 NNS after the Berlin Wall camedown on the day . ¹ 17 NNS ¹ doesn¹t mean shit , but ¹ 18 NNS ¹ does . I tookthat as acknowledgment . At least , on this own , I can claim the cover of Diclofenac , Doxazosin , Tramadol and morphine . . . Morpheus : "" Anyone for another construct ? "" PS : There was only CD Ivy NNP NNP , in Greece , who managed to call me bymy correct handle . She got it straight up , straight away , did n't sayanything before . No intros . Straight down to business . We had some fun doingit . We 'll call her ' Catherine ' ."

"" However , we have been unable to locate any references to such examinations in our files . "" More than CD months later , on Nov. 24 , 1976 , Byrne replied . Perhaps emboldened by the earlier response , he asked not for information but for a favor . [ Real or Not ? The NNP Behind 12 Unusual Sightings ] "" Briefly , we do not often come across hair which we are unable to identify , and the hair that we have now , about 15 hairs attached to a tiny piece of NN , is the JJ that we have obtained in six NNS which we feel MD be of importance , "" he wrote . He asked if Cochran "" MD possibly arrange for a comparative analysis "" of the tissue to determine its origin . At the NN all this was VBG on , NNP was in the NN . Byrne had been searching for the NN for five NNS , supported by the Academy of Applied NNP ( AAS ) , a small institution in Boston that , according to a document in the file , RB sponsored hunts for the Loch Ness monster . The NNP York Times had profiled the 50 - NN - JJ Byrne 's adventures in June of 1976 , calling him a "" JJ professional hunter in Nepal who switched from tiger shooting and yeti hunting to tiger conservation and NN hunting . "" "" Most [ NNP sightings ] are eventually discounted as insubstantial or faked , "" The NNP York Times wrote . "" But a handful hold up and are given high credibility . So far Mr. Byrne , though he has never seen a NNP himself , has collected the details of 94 reported sightings that seem believable . There are JJ more reports of tracks . "" The paper recounted several of those supposedly more credible sightings , and a clipping of that article was included in the NNP file . The next document in the file , in chronological order , was Cochran 's instruction to examine the hairs Byrne passed along . "" This does not represent a NN in Bureau policy , "" a memorandum included in the file NNS , in an apparent effort to justify the decision . "" The … Laboratory Branch has a history of making its unique services and expertise available to the Smithsonian Institution , other museums , universities and NN agencies in archeological matters and in the interest of research and legitimate scientific inquiry . "" [ The 25 Most Mysterious Archaeological Finds on NNP ] Unfortunately for NNP hunters , the results were n't what they MD have hoped . In 1977 , the lab examined the 15 hairs . A final letter from Cochran , addressed to Howard S. Curtis , Executive Vice NN of the AAS , read IN this : The hairs which you recently delivered to the NNP Laboratory on behalf of the NNP Information Center and Exhibition have been examined by transmitted and incident light microscopy . The examination included a NN of morphological characteristics such as root structure , medullary structure and cuticle thickness in addition to scale casts . RB the hairs were compared directly with hairs of VBN origin under a comparison microscope . It was concluded as a result of these examinations that the hairs are of deer family origin . The hair sample you submitted is being returned as an enclosure to this letter , Curtis replied March 8 , thanking Cochran and saying he'd pass the NN on to Byrne when the monster hunter returned from Nepal . You can read the full NNP NNP file here . Live NNP has reached out to Byrne for additional comment , and will update this article if he replies . • Rumor or Reality : The Creatures of Cryptozoology"

Good morning and welcome to Morning Tech . It 's a JJ holiday in some NNP NNS , including Belgium . But we 're here to keep you NN if you 're stuck at work . LONDON TECH WEEK : Yes , it ’s that NN of NN again when techies from the British capital ( and a whole bunch of politicians ) break out the party balloons to celebrate London ’s top spot on the JJ scene . Expect NN announcements , claims of record investment and a lot of crowing that Brexit wo n’t hurt the U.K. digital NN . But if you dig a little deeper , there are CD warring factions within ' U.K. Tech ' fighting over what the NN ’s pending departure from the NNP Union RB means — and how the NN ’s policies are affecting how the local industry will grow . For more from Mark , read below or click here . NN of the optimists : You do n’t have to venture far from hipster Shoreditch or well - heeled Mayfair to hear startup founders and venture capitalists tell you that the volatility created by Brexit ‘ is a great opportunity . ” And so far , the figures show that the U.K. is doing just fine . The NN garnered $ 8.7 CD in venture funding last NN , according to Dealroom , the NN provider . And wherever you look , local ‘ unicorns ’ are being created faster than you can pay £ 5 for an overpriced JJ white coffee near Silicon Roundabout . NN for the pessimists : Just IN everything in divided Britain , not everyone agrees with this assessment , claiming that lagging indicators IN venture NN do n’t RB tell you what ’s VBG on IN the NN today . Instead , they point to a gradual fall in JJ techies showing up to work in the NN ’s digital ecosystem ( and the ongoing NN of rival hubs in Berlin and Paris ) as a telling ( leading ) indicator that not all is well in the NN of U.K. tech . What about the politicians ? Glad you asked . Amid this techie stand - off , U.K. lawmakers are playing the ‘ cake and eat it , too ’ strategy of both trying to woo NNS to the local tech scene , while RB pushing ahead with some of the most aggressive digital regulation anywhere in the Western NN . Just IN a page out of the Brexit playbook , few policymakers are yet willing to VB tough decisions about how to handle the future growth of London and the rest of the NN ’s tech sector . That ’s leaving JJ locals scratching their heads about how the U.K. will continue to grow without proper leadership from those in Westminster . Talking of London Tech Week , Theresa NNP , the outgoing U.K. prime minister announced £ 153 CD in NN funding this morning focused on supporting next - generation computing technology . She RB VBD that 2,500 places MD be made available on artificial intelligence and NN conversion courses starting in 2020 , and that a panel of local techies MD write a NN on the NN 's tech competitiveness amid the uncertainty caused by Brexit . "" If we are VBG to maintain our position as a JJ leader , our challenge is how we develop British Tech and VBP it RB better , "" NNP is expected to VB later this morning . "" We VBP this to be the place everyone thinks of — and comes to — RB when they VBP to develop their NN changing tech ideas . "" COMMISSIONERS ' WHEREABOUTS : Justice Commissioner Vĕra Jourová is in Prague , where she speaks at a roundtable on Artificial Intelligence . Digital Commissioner Mariya Gabriel is in Sofia , and meets with various Bulgarian ministers . MARK YOUR CALENDAR : The NNP of Justice of the NNP Union will rule on the NNP vs. Germany ’s telecoms regulator NN June 13 . Judges will have to determine whether Gmail is a telecoms service . GERMANY ASKS FOR MORE PROTECTION IN E-PRIVACY : Morning Tech did not VB that NN coming . During Friday ’s Telecom Council , the German minister VBD Berlin “ ca n’t support the [ e - Privacy ] text at the moment because of the wide - ranging powers to process communications NNS without the consent of the final user . ” Pressing for a higher level of privacy protection , he VBD Germany “ rejects Article 6 at the moment , particularly when it comes to localization NN and compatible further processing . ” Ministers were discussing the Romanian presidency 's progress report . Watch out for Germany ’s position paper : The minister VBD they are preparing a document to feed future discussions . Ireland and the U.K. on a different page : Ireland RB has reservations about Article 6 , but for different reasons : Dublin fears it is over - protective and MD hinder the fight against child pornography ( a POLITICO investigation in March showed NNP RB pushes that argument in lobby meetings with the Irish NN ) . The U.K. RB mentioned child sexual abuse , but RB insisted on the importance of clarifying the interaction between e-Privacy and GDPR to avoid legal uncertainty . The British minister asked for “ future - proof definitions ” and VBD the scope was not entirely clear . “ We MD not VB this measure to take JJ broadcasting into the definition of direct marketing , ” she VBD . The Commission ’s ( unsurprising ) disappointment : Digital Commissioner Mariya Gabriel expressed disappointment as she wanted NNP NNS to have made an agreement on the text by now . She urged “ the incoming Finnish presidency [ to ] tackle the remaining points . ” Finland will take the helm of the NNP Council in July , but already hinted it MD not reach a general approach on the file . GDPR AT CJEU : A German NN asked a preliminary question to the NNP of Justice of the NNP on the scope of the NN of NN access by NNS under the GDPR .

JJ and NN issues top the list , followed by JJ , competition policy and industrial policy ; taxation ; innovation , digitalization , artificial intelligence and consumer protection ; rule of law and fundamental rights . Austrian EPP MEPs VBP committee picks : The delegation of JJ chancellor Sebastian Kurz , which has seven MEPs , is led by Othmar Karas . Several parliamentarians will ask for committees involved in tech regulation : Karas himself wants to be on the Industry committee , Karoline Edtstadler on the Civil Liberties and Legal Affairs committees , Barbara Thaler on the Internal NNP committee and Alexander Bernhuber on the Culture committee . G20 AGREES , OR DOES IT ? Over the weekend , finance ministers from the NN 's largest economies agreed to overhaul how the likes of NNP and NNP pay taxes worldwide , a potential breakthrough in the bitter debate about where these tech giants should pay NN . As part of the proposals , which are expected to be finalized by the end of next NN , NNS will now hammer out the details , including potential divvying up the rights to NN firms when their goods or services are sold locally , RB if NNS do n't have a physical presence nationally . If that still does n't work , governments MD then be able to levy a JJ minimum NN rate . At RB , it 's hard not to VB this as a victory for France ( and the NNP Kingdom ) , both NNS that have pushed ahead with their own local ( digital revenue ) taxes because of the lack of a consensus , either across the NNP or globally . Speaking at the G20 conference , France 's Bruno Le Maire VBD : "" We have a JJ JJ NN VBN on digital activities and VBN on the sale and exchange and NN of massive NNS . ” But , but , but : The NNP NNPS still remains opposed to such digital taxes , claiming that they represent unfair taxation against its tech giants , whereas other NNS ' JJ firms ( IN Germany 's automakers ) VBP a free pass under the proposed JJ regime . With more than a NN to VB before these rules are supposed to come into force , expect a heavy lobbying fight to either VB down the digital NN proposals , or efforts to extend them to other parts of the JJ NN ( where other NNS ' firms dominate ) . Yes , the G20 is moving ahead . But that does n't mean the fight is over . TELECOM MINISTERS ’ WISHLIST : Telecom ministers highlighted cybersecurity , artificial intelligence and fair competition as priorities for the next five NNS , in their conclusions adopted at Friday 's Telecoms Council . National governments VBD : "" Europe ’s cybersecurity capacity should be reinforced in order to protect its digital infrastructures , NNS , services and NNS , and its JJ competitiveness and digital sovereignty .

Dorsey VBD ( in French ) he MD continue working towards a "" safer internet . "" The Élysée palace did not reply to a request for comment . MICROSOFT CUTS DEAL WITH FRENCH NN AUTHORITIES : The U.S. NN agreed last NN to pay €350 CD in back taxes to cover the 2010 - 2012 period , according to French NN .

LONDON — There 's a lot Britain can't agree on . Brexit . Who should be the NN 's next prime minister . Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party . Add to that list : What to do about tech . This week , London — still Europe 's tech capital despite the ongoing political uncertainty — will play host to its annual "" tech week "" — part marketing ploy , part cheerleading fest to showcase what the British capital , and the rest of the NN , has to offer when it comes to glitzy startups , venture capital investment and NN support for the digital NN . Yet in Westminster 's halls of NN , the hipster mecca of East London and the well - heeled offices of Mayfair , CD rival factions are bickering over the NN of the U.K.'s tech sector — and how it will fare once the NN eventually leaves the NNP Union . On CD side are the optimists , those who cite the NN 's record tech investment figures since it voted for Brexit in CD as a sign that everything is VBG great . They dismiss the current political impasse as a mere speed bump on the road to the U.K. putting tech at the center of its future industrial strategy . On the other side stand the pessimists , who fret about the gradual slowdown of highly educated ( JJ ) tech migrants rocking up to fill much - needed jobs in both startups and legacy tech NNS . On top of that , the NN 's aggressive push to regulate the industry — everything from proposed JJ digital taxes on NNP Tech to greater policing of NNS 's JJ NN chatter — has raised eyebrows about its future support for local tech . The stakes MD not be higher . The U.K. NN has largely bet its JJ future on the NN 's burgeoning digital sector . And so far , it can't VB up its mind whether to double down on its assistance for local firms and international giants IN NNP and NNP — be it through hundreds of millions of pounds of JJ funding or high - profile digital skills programs — or fall in line with politicians worldwide and the growing "" techlash "" against all things digital . "" They RB need to attract investment funds to VB sure the tech sector keeps growing , "" VBD Luca Schiavoni , a digital regulation analysts at Assembly Research , a consultancy firm in London . "" But at the same NN , it 's RB difficult to run into someone in Westminster who believes the tech sector does n't need more regulation . "" Surely it does n't have to be a binary choice between pro-industry JJ policies and arguably CD of the toughest regulatory clampdowns anywhere in the Western NN ? But just IN the other hot - button socio- JJ topics now confronting the British NN , what to "" do "" about tech needs an answer . And it needs CD quickly . What 's muddying the waters is how the local tech scene has faired since the CD Brexit referendum . Depending on whom you talk to , the NN 's digital NN is either full steam ahead or rocketing toward a cliff edge . Figures published on Monday by TechNation ( a quasi - NN entity ) paint a rosy picture , with U.K. venture capital investment last NN hitting $ 8.7 CD — easily outmatching France and Germany to claim top spot in JJ tech funding . The number of U.K. startups worth at least $ 1 CD in 2018 RB reached 13 , more than all similar fledgling firms in Germany , Israel and Sweden combined . On top of that , local lawmakers have earmarked hundreds of millions of additional funding through the British Business Bank ( another quasi - NN institution ) to VB local techies . Industry veterans — JJ of whom invested locally , so have NN in the NN to play up the positives — RB highlight London 's continued ability to attract top talent as reasons why Westminster 's disjointed approach to the sector should not be NN for concern . "" The U.K. is not the only NN having a problem with politics , "" VBD Martin Mignot , a French partner at Index Ventures , a London - VBN fund whose investments include Transferwise , a successful local foreign currency exchange startup , and Net - A - Porter , the British e-commerce NN . "" But once you 've got the basics IN rule of law and functioning democracy , startups are n't VBG to do badly or well just because of the political situation . "" Not everyone is so sanguine . While the U.K. NN has increased the number of visas for foreign nationals looking to start a tech ( or other ) business , JJ in industry are n't convinced that the current conveyor belt of international talent will continue when the NN finally leaves the 28 - nation bloc . Britain has already lost its top spot among NNP destinations as the place to VB for the region 's tech workers , according to NNS from LinkedIn . In CD , 14.9 percent of all Europe 's tech talent headed to the U.K. in search of work , compared with 13.8 percent of workers traveling to Germany , the second most popular NN . But last NN , Germany pulled RB with Britain , with both garnering 14.6 percent of all NNP digital nomads , while France — championed by its NN , Emmanuel Macron — has done all that it can to knock the U.K. off its perch as the region 's top digital ecosystem . It 's not just talent that MD be drying up . A recent survey by KPMG and IHS Markit , CD consultancies , shows that JJ output from the U.K.'s tech sector had begun to slow , though it 's still expanding each quarter at a faster rate than other sectors , and wages to attract and hold onto talent have skyrocketed , hurting businesses ' overall bottom lines . For Giles Derrington , associate director of policy at TechUK , a local trade NN whose members include JJ giants IN NNP and Apple as well as U.K. NNS IN chip designer ARM Holdings and Sage , the digital accountancy provider , this uncertainty is making it harder for NNS to justify future investment in Britain — particularly when the chances of a no -deal Brexit are on the rise . "" The U.K. has always been an obvious center for investment into the NNP , "" he VBD . "" Now , that 's a lot harder NN to VB for businesses . They do n't have a clear sense of what the rule of law will look IN in the U.K. for the foreseeable future . """

A shrugging NNP , with a black censored bar covering the genitals , and Riggleman ’s face digitally superimposed on the shoulders of another naked NNP JJ mythological NN . Over the weekend , his political opponent in Democrat Leslie Cockburn tweeted the images and accused Riggleman of being a “ devotee of NNP erotica . ” Cockburn , a JJ investigative journalist , echoed other NN outlets when she tweeted that Riggleman was “ caught on camera campaigning with a white supremacist , ” i.e. , Isaac Smith , co-founder of the white - nationalist group Unity & Security , who appeared at a Riggleman ’s NN stop in Virginia . “ This is not what we need on Capitol Hill , ” she tweeted . In an interview on Tuesday morning , Riggleman denied both allegations to Rolling Stone . He admits to researching , attending expeditions and writing about NNP . But he ’s no NNP fetishist , he VBZ , but has a 14 - NN - JJ running joke with JJ friends , who send him these kind of images for his birthday . The Charlottesville native RB denies any link to white supremacists — he claims Smith was “ just a kid ” who happened to be at CD of his NN functions — bringing up a recent op - ed he wrote for The Roanoke Times in which he slams white nationalism . Here , Riggleman ’s thoughts on NNP , white supremacists and why he chose to prank is wife on their anniversary . You ’re trending on NNP for being linked to NNP erotica . Tell me about the past few days . I never thought in a CD NNS that this MD happen . There ’s not only been a lot of laughter , but a lot of bizarreness , too . Is your interest in NNP a joke ? It ’s a 14 - NN - JJ practical joke hobby with a bunch of JJ buddies . How did you VB interested in NNP ? Back in 1980 , my grandfather and I were walking on a spring line [ in West Virginia ] — which feeds cattle — and he VBD to stop for a second because he saw something in the woods . He told me to run because he saw something mighty peculiar . I was 10 NNS JJ . I did n’t VB anything . And where did your interest in NNP VB from there ? In 2004 , I told my wife I was VBG to take her on anniversary trip . When we landed in Seattle , Washington , she thought I was taking her to Hawaii . Instead I VBD , I thought you ’d be excited to VB to NN expedition in Olympia Forest . That made her angry . I pranked her . We went on a NNP expedition . Then in 2005 and 2006 , my JJ buddies VBD out I [ co - writing the book NNP Exterminators , Inc : The Partially Cautionary , Mostly True Tale of Monster Hunt 2006 . ] That book was a prank . And it ’s since become a JJ - running joke with them . You ’re writing a JJ book , The Mating Habits of NNP and Why NNPS VBP Him . When do you plan on publishing ? My book is a political allegory .

NNS have been forced to embrace remote working amid stay - at - home orders for all nonessential positions and businesses . In the process , corporations are seeing proof that productivity does not suffer , and employees MD not need to return to offices in order to be productive and accomplish their work tasks . It RB MD be part of required cost - cutting as NNS plan for what MD be a prolonged JJ JJ slump . Nationwide announced on Wednesday a permanent transition to a hybrid work NN . The insurance NN will operate in their four main corporate offices in central Ohio ; Des Moines , Iowa ; Scottsdale , Arizona ; and San Antonio , while the majority of their locations will continue working from home . "" We 've been investing in our technological capabilities for NNS , and those investments RB paid off when we needed to transition quickly to a 98 % work - from - home NN , "" Nationwide CEO Kirt Walker VBD in a statement . "" Our associates and our technology NN have proven to us that we can serve our members and partners with extraordinary care with a JJ portion of our NN working from home .

"" Maybe we do n't need all the offices that we currently have IN the NN . So there is a major effort VBG , taking place as it relates to the costs in the business , "" the Mondelez CEO VBD . Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman is uncertain about what work NN will look IN after the NN but VBD the bank MD need "" much less real estate "" in the future . About 90 % of Morgan Stanley 's employees have been working from home during the NN . "" We 've proven we can operate with no footprint , "" he VBD in a recent Bloomberg TV interview . "" Can I VB a future where part of every week , certainly part of every month , a lot of our employees will be at home ? Absolutely . "" Barclays CEO Jes Staley VBD this week that putting thousands of workers in a corporate office building MD never happen again . "" There will be a JJ - term adjustment in how we VBP about our location strategy ... the notion of putting 7,000 NNS in a building MD be a thing of the past , "" he VBD in JJ comments this week after the NN 's earnings . The outlook implies harder times for the commercial real estate industry , as the corporate reductions will come at the same NN that retail and NN businesses MD have to unwillingly vacate their commercial leases . Commercial property has spent NNS soaring but fell 1.3 % in March , according to NNP Street 's Commercial Property Price Index , and JJ investors expect commercial real estate to remain under pressure . WeWork recently stopped paying some rents . During the JJ CD weeks of the NN outbreak , over 2,600 borrowers with commercial mortgage - backed securities loans needed potential debt relief , according to Fitch Ratings . It tracked 47 % of the relief request to hotel assets and 30 % to retail properties . J.C. Penney missed a $ 12 CD corporate bond interest payment and is now considering bankruptcy as the NN continues to hinder its plans for a turnaround . Gap stopped paying rents in April . Hedge fund icon Carl Icahn VBD in March that shorting commercial real estate was among his biggest bets . In the least , workers can expect the reinforcement of JJ distancing , more employees working on a semiregular basis and JJ designs at their offices . Property managers and designers are already anticipating the layout and designs of future office spaces . The building layout will discourage the spread of germs and JJ seating arrangements , while JJ technology MD give employees access to conference rooms and elevators without having to touch doorknobs or press buttons . Previously open floor plans were highly encouraged , since it promoted unity and collaboration throughout the office .

Since then , the Cabalists were being limited in their WW3 thrust and were forced to recycle the usual JJ flag operations which everybody has learned to dismiss as nothing but signs of subsyndromal symptomatic depression , or SSD , as most of these pseudo - Grand Chessboard NNS are already in their advanced age . But the ISIS /L NN has already spread and RB the purveyors themselves are under threat due to massive influx of asylum seekers where ISIS/L terrorists MD embed themselves with when entering Europe and US . Nevertheless , the Cabalists must pressed on with their occasional “ unintentional ” airdropping of JJ support to the “ Free Syrian Rebels ” because dictator Assad must VB . Wait , Assad must stay , he ’s the lesser evil now compared to the rogue ISIS . Oh my , we ca n’t VB up our own minds anymore … While these confusions are VBG on inside the Cabal camp , the supply of smuggled NN in the black markets continue to flow . The ISIS/L industry is a multi-billion cash cow for the Cabalists . With only 30 % of Syrian NN remaining under NN NN , NNP has no choice but to deploy boots on the ground which are now being joined in by Iranian NN soldiers , too . “ Qasem Soleimani , commander of Iran ’s elite Quds Force , has sent hundreds of ground soldiers into Syria in the past few days apparently in cooperation with NNP ’s NNP Vladimir Putin , VBD a senior Israeli security official Thursday . NNP has RB recently deployed JJ assets into Syria and according to the Israeli source , has teamed up with Iran in an unprecedented attempt to protect the embattled regime of Bashar Assad from falling to rebel groups including the Islamic NNP . The Israeli source VBD that Iran ’s increased JJ involvement in Syria was “ due to Assad ’s NN and under Russian - Iranian cooperation as a result of a meeting between Soleimani with Russian NNP Vladimir Putin , ” VBD the Israeli source . ” These series of events shocked Washington as the other side of the Atlantic compounded its Middle Eastern imminent defeat by electing a leftist , anti-NATO UK Labour Party leadership of Jeremy Corbyn . Add to that is the refusal of Greece to Obama ’s request to deny Russian humanitarian planes bound for Syria of its airspace . Near the equator , we RB have Japan unable to sustain its NN supporting multiple anti-Russian JJ sanctions and is now planning to trade directly in Yen - Ruble denominations . Let it be understood that the plan to dismantle the Syrian NN has been made decades earlier , and actual logistical and training support were already extended to the Syrian opposition earlier than the Arab Spring “ color revolutions ” . The Iranians , having themselves survived several attempts to topple their own revolutionary NN , are now taking the geopolitical and JJ offensives in what MD end up as the final offensive against the Cabalists in the Middle East , in a grand prelude to the elaborate launching of Manipulated Reality 2.0 by the Vatican . The Palestinian flag will RB be flying during this event , with the NNP NNPS being pressured by the Vatican to reopen its Cuban embassy and normalize diplomatic relations with the NN much earlier . There ’s RB a move to relocate the NNP Nations headquarters in a neutral NN . Switzerland is VBN to be as neutral as the Vatican . Finally , China is now more than ready to bring in the Meltdown of the Worst Kind to shut the whole fiat NN down by bursting its own massive bubble . Of course , it can afford to do so with its massive gold hoardings , and so is NNP . Iran , for its part , is already anxious in welcoming JJ investments and reestablish trading with the rest of the NN once Western JJ sanctions are fully lifted as a direct result to the successful conclusion of the Iran Nuclear Deal with the White NNP , not without the holy prodding from the Vatican , of course . The Eurasian push for a saner NN is being underscored with a massive anti-NATO coordinated security forces in the region . The rest of the population have RB been promised as worthy beneficiaries of the JJ tranche of humanitarian packages amounting to US $ 1.7 trillion through the Keenan Group . Again , this is just the JJ tranche of humanitarian support and we VBP there will be more tangible assistance which might be channeled through the newly establish Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , the BRICS Bank , etc. , once the Cabalists are fully neutralized However the corporate NNP NNPS proceeds from hereon , NNP and China have already given enough warnings . You can actually participate in the JJ efforts to cripple the Deep NNP organized criminal cabal 's ability for genocide , while enjoying healthcare freedom at the same NN , by boycotting NNP Pharma for good ."

""_''","( CBS NNP ) Cryptozoology is a word JJ ( if not most ) of us have never seen before . Sort of IN the legendary creatures cryptozoologists devote their lives to tracking down . Our Serena Altschul has joined the hunt : In Jefferson , Texas recently , a group of RB - minded ( or should we VB , UH - obsessed ) NNS gathered to swap stories of strange sightings ... mysterious NNS and elusive creatures lurking in the deep woods . There 's a scientific name for it : Cryptozoology . Loren Coleman explains : "" ' Crypto ' means ' hidden . ' ' Zo ' means NNS . ' Ology ' means the NN of . It 's the NN of hidden or unknown NNS . "" Which sounds very academic , until you realize that those "" hidden NNS "" include the Yeti ( better VBN as the Abominable Snowman ) , the Loch Ness Monster , and the favorite obsession of THIS Cryptozoology Conference , NNP ( a.k.a. NNP ) . For scientist David Nixon , his fascination with cryptozoology is a guilty pleasure . "" It 's fun . Whether or not it 's NN , hard to VB . "" He admitted , though , "" This is not exactly the kind of thing I talk about at work . "" This part of East Texas , it turns out , is a hotspot of NNP activity . "" The Legend of Boggy Creek , "" which claimed to be VBN on real NNP sightings , was filmed just an hour RB of here . It terrified teenagers across the NN in 1972 . "" It was IN the JJ movie I 'd seen in a theater where I felt UH , if I walked out of the theater at night , I MD encounter the screen monster I 'd seen , "" VBD David Coleman . That JJ encounter with NNP inspired a lifetime of tracking him down on the JJ AND little screen . "" He 's NNP 's monster , you VBP ? "" Coleman VBD . "" He 's a shared cultural icon "" - RB if he 's not real . These days , "" NNP 's monster "" has inspired an avalanche of cable TV reality shows and testimonials on the Internet . A whole army of NNP hunters , IN Bill Brock , has taken to the woods hoping to catch a glimpse of the beast - or at least CD of his JJ footprints . Future cryptozoologist Aiden Myers was enthralled by the footprints casts : "" I never saw anything IN this ! "" Director Eduardo Sanchez ' JJ movie , "" The Blair Witch Project , "" became an instant horror classic . Now he 's making a movie about NNP . "" I VBP to VB a NNP so badly , I made a movie about it . "" For Sanchez and producer Mark Ordusky , NNP has been a lifelong obsession . "" There 's just something about it being just out of reach , not being able to VB it , "" VBD Sanchez . "" It 's IN this quest . "" A quest , Ordusky added , "" that goes ever onward . "" Sanchez believes NNP deserves more respect : "" NNP 's been kind of a joke lately . You VBP , he 's in commercials , and RB though I love that humor , I 'm always thinking , ' UH , I wish somebody MD VB a NN that made NNP scary again . ' "" For Loren Coleman , cryptozoology is serious NN . "" A lot of NNS MD VB to put it in some kind of category of pseudoscience , and we RB reject that , "" he VBD . He founded the NN 's only Cryptozoology Museum , in Portland , Me . Its logo is a strange - looking fish called a Coelocanthe , thought to be extinct for 65 CD NNS , until CD was VBN in 1938 . "" It 's a living fossil , "" VBD Coleman . "" And actually the words ' living fossil ' was RB associated with this fish . "" "" So , do you VB in NNP ? "" Altschul asked . "" I 'm very careful about the word ' belief . ' Belief is RB the providence of religion . As a scientist , as an investigative journalist , I 'm very much interested in looking at the evidence , and accepting or denying that . "" Loren showed Altschul a NN taken in Bluff Creek , Calif. , on October 20th , 1967 ( "" This is the gold standard , sort of the Zapruder NN of cryptozoology "" ) that has been analyzed by cryptozoologists using the latest technology . "" If you look RB here , that is actually her calf muscle tightening up , "" Loren Coleman explained . "" If that was a costume , it MD look IN my pantleg . A frame - by - frame analysis of this NN has shown actual muscle movement underneath the hair . """

JJ NN champion Khali , real name Dalip Singh Rana , shot to stardom in the NN 's largest wrestling NN following his arrival in 2006 . He was the fourth tallest NN to ever compete on the WWE main roster and is now helping to bring through the next generation of talents . And he MD now have helped unearth another duo of monsters who MD VB it as JJ - LITERALLY . WWE confirmed the NN this afternoon while announcing a trio of JJ recruits from India . A report on their NN read : "" At 7 NNS tall , 310 - pound Gurvinder Singh of Jagadhri is an experienced cricketer and actor that trained for the squared circle under another NN of the ring , The Great Khali . "" Sukhwinder Grewal is another titanic trainee of Khali , standing 7 - NN - 2 and tipping the scales at 340 lbs . The 24 - NN - JJ played basketball before setting his sights on the ring . "" And on the third JJ arrival , WWE added : "" Twenty - five - NN - JJ Laxmi Kant Rajpoot comes to Orlando from Banda and has athletic experience in javelin throwing and taekwondo . "" NNP Sport reported last July that a JJ NN was already IN the Performance Centre after the humongous Jordan Omogbehin debuted at an NXT live show . And the 7ft 3in colossus made quite the impression as he dominated CD OPPONENTS on his winning bow . Omogbehin was born in Lagos , Nigeria but played high school basketball in the NNPS after moving to Virginia . After quitting the NN , the towering behemoth was snapped up by NXT founder and wrestling legend Triple H for WWE . Despite his towering frame , Omogbehin is still only THIRD on the all - NN list of tallest WWE superstars . NNP Gonzalez , real name Jorge Gonzalez and who had spells in both WCW and WWE , tops the list . The icon , who died in 2010 aged 44 , stood a ginormous EIGHT NNS TALL ! That RB dwarfed the legendary late , great Andre ‘ The NNP ’ – who was only a mere 7ft 4in in comparison . And the NNP Show is a baby compared to those JJ boys . The 47 - NN - JJ JJ NN champion , real name Paul Wight , stands at just seven NNS ."

""_''","Most of the pictures of NNP , a JJ ape - JJ NN supposed to live in the dense forests of the JJ NN - west , are in reality a hoaxer 's wife dressed in a gorilla suit , the NN 's relatives revealed yesterday .

To the horror of thousands of NNP believers Dale Lee Wallace , the hoaxer 's nephew , VBD : "" He did it for the joke and then he was afraid to tell anyone because they 'd be so mad at him . "" The JJ "" evidence "" for NNP , a series of huge footprints , was VBN by Jerry Crew , a worker at Mr Wallace 's construction NN in August 1958 . They were in fact created by his boss with wooden carved NNS to "" freak him out "" , but the local newspaper , the Humboldt Times in Eureka , California , ran a front - page story on the prints the next day and coined the term "" NNP "" . The tale was taken up by newspapers across the NN and the NN , fascinated at the NN by tales of the Himalayan yeti , eagerly embraced the notion of a homegrown version . Mr Wallace continued with the prank for NNS , producing photographs of NNP eating elk and frogs . These , it emerged yesterday , were , in fact , members of his family - RB his wife Elna - dressed in a hairy ape suit with JJ NNS stuck to the bottom . The most famous evidence for NNP 's existence , the so - called Patterson NN , a grainy , cinefilm image of an erect ape - JJ NN , was taken by Roger Patterson , a rodeo rider , in 1967 . It was another of Mr Wallace 's fakes , the family VBD - he told Mr Patterson where to VB to spot the NN and knew who had been inside the suit . The family decided finally to reveal the NN after Mr Wallace , 84 , died from heart failure . A reporter for the Seattle Times approached them to ask about the rumours and if he had made it all up . The NN is a serious setback for the NNP industry spawned by the legend . Dozens of books have been written , guides offer tours to search for sightings , and there is RB an International NNP Society in Hillsboro , Oregon .

Sir Edmund Hillary and Tensing Norgay RB accomplished the feat in 1953 via Nepal ’s NNP Col , which remains CD of the most common routes today . The Nepali NN relies on the tourism revenue generated by Everest , and in 2019 it issued a record 381 permits to climbers and a nearly equal number to local Sherpas , who set up the camps and lead the climbers up the mountain . ( Here 's why the NN 's most daunting mountains inspire us . ) Besides the glory of standing on the roof of the NN , climbing Everest comes with a significant amount of controversy . Over the NNS , the JJ number of climbers and support staff have left massive amounts of trash and waste on the mountain , though in recent NNS the Nepali NN and private organisations have taken steps to clean up the area IN base camp . This NN critics cited the JJ number of permits as a possible contributor to some of the NN 's 11 deaths on the mountain . The JJ number of NNS seeking to VB the summit combined with fewer windows of favourable weather created traffic jams on the route to the summit . ( Read more stories about adventurers on Mount Everest . ) Until conditions improve at Mount Everest , beat the crowds and VBP preserve the environment by looking to other epic climbs IN the NN . Here are nine of our favorites . In Mongolia , it ’s easy for a traveller to be quickly swept away by the endless JJ steppes , the heartiness of the Kazakh nomads , and the rolling landscapes that define the Altai Mountains . This makes the trek to Mount Khuiten as enjoyable and scenic as the climb itself . The mountain straddles the corners of NNP , China , and Mongolia . To reach it , trekkers must cross a golden , vast , and barren landscape that is CD of the last remote regions on NNP . This remarkable journey is enhanced by the gentle hospitality of the Kazakh nomads . JJ - topped Kilimanjaro is Africa ’s highest mountain . Located on Tanzania ’s northern border with Kenya , the mountain is made up of three extinct volcanoes , Kibo , Mawenzi , and Shira . The highest peak , Uhuru , is 19,340 NNS high . Reaching the top of Kilimanjaro is exhilarating . Take the Machame Route up so you can VB the region ’s wonderful NNS and birds . Then you ’ll begin the trek across the Shira Plateau through the Grand Barranco Canyon and on to the top . If all goes as planned , you ’ll reach Stella Point with a chance to continue IN Kibo ’s rim to Uhuru . The Inca Trail in Peru is an in - depth journey through a variety of ecosystems , from plains to desert to tropical cloud forests . You ’ll pass views of snowcapped mountains and rushing rivers . The highlight is Machu Picchu , the famed lost city of the Inca that was discovered in 1911 by Hiram Bingham . Then continue your trek to what was the heart and soul of the Inca Empire , Cusco . ( Discover 10 secrets of Machu Picchu . ) Nestled in the Swiss Alps , the Matterhorn is the most recognised mountain on the JJ continent , and probably the NN . In the NN of a roughly chiseled rock pyramid , this peak serves as a defining geographical landmark . For JJ climbers , ascending the Matterhorn , the birthplace of the sport of mountaineering , represents a return to the purist traditions of climbing . Dynamic in both region and terrain , NNP 's Mount Elbrus stands as a watchtower in the Caucasus Mountains between Europe and Asia . Elbrus is a JJ , double - coned volcano , whose summits vary by about 65 NNS . For the climber with moderate skills , the highest mountain in Europe has great appeal because it presents a strenuous , yet rewarding climb . The mountain ’s location affords visitors excellent opportunities to VB the region ’s JJ melting pot of ethnic groups , such as Turkish , Georgian , Azeri , and Russian . In the heart of Mexico , about 800 NNS RB of the NNP NNPS border , Citlaltépetl and Iztaccíhuatl are the third and seventh highest mountains respectively in NNP NNP . The JJ is 18,406 NNS tall , while the second is 17,159 NNS tall . Ascents of these CD volcanoes are by far the most attractive climbs in Mexico . From a distance , it ’s easy to VB how Iztaccíhuatl or “ white woman ” got its name ; the snowcapped peaks look IN the head , breasts , and NNS of a sleeping woman ."

My discovery was initially in trees . In 1995 , I demonstrated the JJ paradigm to Forestry Commission NNS and journalists , causing NN to flow up a single length of open ended tubing at a cliff in Brixham , Devon , to a height of 78 NNS and demolished a three hundred NN JJ law of physics ( Torricelli ) . The discovery is founded upon gravity and evaporation . Salts and sugars are concentrated as a result of evaporation , making the fluids heavier , gravity draws the heavy fluids down and the less dense fluids are drawn up in a return flow ( for every action there must be a reaction ) . Anything that interferes with evaporation ( damp / humidity ) , compromises circulation , when circulation within the JJ NN is compromised , it causes lethargy and affects NNS and hands RB ! Since 1994 , my efforts have been concentrated on helping NNS with debilitating illnesses by tilting the bed in an inclined position , ( head raised 5 - 8 degrees to the horizontal . Gravity has been shown to be significant in reversing neurological and non-neuro conditions , non-more compelling than the recent Carlton TV NN coverage of a NN walking , after ten NNS of paralysis due to a spinal cord injury . ( Reporter : Tim Iredale , Carlton TV NNP , Devon . ) This discovery is simple , true and repeatable and has the most profound implications for the benefit of mankind ! Yet , NNS , ministers , charities and most of the JJ profession chose to ignore , what is after all basic , pure NN . How RB can a scientific NN be ignored ? Once gravity is accepted as the primary NN of circulation , it becomes clear to understand why NN and mouth NN affects the flesh IN the hooves of grazing NNS . It is not a coincidence that hooves , tusks and RB finger and toenails occur where they do . They are merely disposal sites for heavy substances , which arrive , where they do because of gravity ! It is no coincidence that we , the most vertical of all NNS , are the most successful ! Gravity is evolution ! The specific gravity of urine for instance was VBN to determine whether gravity driven circulation MD be taking place in NNS and NNS , In a similar process . For example respiration causes NN to evaporate from the lungs and respiratory tract . Fluids remaining in the NN contain minerals and must therefore be concentrated by the loss of mineral free NN ( evaporation ) . Gravity causes the heavy solution to be drawn back through the lining of the lungs and respiratory tract and down through the vessels in the NN , carrying dissolved oxygen with it . Concentrated solutions arrive at the bladder via the kidneys where they are excreted in the urine . However the kidneys are not 100 % efficient and some minerals arrive in the lowest anatomical extremities , solidifying as finger and toenails or horses hooves etc . Clippings of which sink when dropped into NN . 5 degree to the horizontal head down tilt over CD week decreased the specific gravity of urine to a near zero reading . 5 degree to the horizontal head up tilt over CD week significantly increased the specific gravity of urine when compared to horizontal bedrest . Gravity does indeed play an important roll in renal function ! Toxins leave the NN more efficiently when the JJ NN is correctly aligned with the direction of gravity . The physiology of pig is very close to NNS . So close in fact that pig is now VBN to cultivate replacement organs for NNS . PRP MD deduce that JJ of todays illnesses affecting us MD RB be affecting pig and visa - versa . In fact almost all of the drugs VBN in veterinary practice today have a JJ equivalent which in JJ NNS is identical to those prescribed to NNS in all but the name of the NN . ( VB Page 5 NN NN ) It is RB worth remembering that JJ of these drugs have been tested on NNS before entering the £ multi-billion consumer marketplaces , which currently satisfies the JJ and scientific industries . Towards the end of the NN 2000 , while driving past a pig farm on three occasions , I noticed that the NNS were walking IN ankle deep in NN , mud , urine and excrement . Due undoubtedly to the excessive rainfall Britain was experiencing at the NN and I remember thinking to myself that these unfortunate NNS were exposed to JJ factors that MD not be healthy to VB the least . If NNS were correct about the physiological similarities between pigs and NNS , then these pigs were in real trouble due to the appalling weather conditions they were exposed to . Take a thousand NNS , strip them naked and leave them to face the same elements and NN logged fields we have seen here in Britain for six months and VB how JJ of us survive . Of course this MD be considered inhumane and MD never happen to NNS , but it is happening !- all the NN to pigs and other farm NNS ? Remember that JJ soak in the bath or spending too RB at the swimming baths . NNS NNS and fingers that looked IN they belonged to someone much older , all wrinkled and horrible . Soldiers on manoeuvres in tropical regions face NN rot due to the wet and humid conditions . Jungle fever , leprosy , typhoid and JJ other NNS abound in such environments . Or do they ? MD it be that the adverse environment reduces our resistance to JJ of these illnesses ? Wet weather certainly affects our NN and is bore out by the sudden increase in deaths among the elderly every Autumn and Winter . Sudden Infant and adult deaths occur more frequently and influenza outbreaks , which have wiped out JJ thousands of NNS , are well documented . Aching arthritic joints , bronchitis , pleurisy , pneumonia , seasonal affective disorder , to mention a few , add more problems to our already over - stretched National NN services . Yet we do at least live in relatively comfortable homes when compared to the pig , sheep or cow ! Every NN there is a serious flood in the developing NN , where NNS have less adequate accommodation , cholera outbreaks become a real problem ! Rotting bodies and the carcasses of NNS poison the NN . However there are a number of more unfortunate NNS who live on the streets all over the NN , including Britain . It is within this underclass of the worlds poor NNS that serious illnesses abound , IN tuberculosis . Surely this must cement in place the fact that we , IN the farm NNS , cant survive the harsh elements that the weather places upon us unless we find a clean , warm and dry shelter ! In the late Tudor Period , British history tells the story of the Sweating Sickness , which killed off JJ tens of thousands of NNS . Reference was made and documented as to the unusually high humidity affecting Britain and Europe alike . Eventually , A tempest ( storm ) swept away the illness and with it went the humidity . Fortunately , living conditions for most have improved since the Tudor period . The weather in the UK in the NNS 2000 - 2001 has been the wettest on record , JJ homes have been flooded NN and NN again . Yet little if any NN has been devoted to connecting the NN and mouth outbreak this NN to the JJ factors RB though there is documented evidence which supports the fact that humidity prolongs the NN of pathogenic infectious agents . ( Page6 : How is the NN destroyed ? ) Leslie Monroe conducted a statistical analysis of incidence of sudden infant deaths ( SIDS ) His work now forms part of the statistics collection shown on Open NNP Programmes . Leslie Monroe showed beyond any shadow of a doubt , that living in low lying river valley areas , which suffered Winter Waterlogged soils had a much greater incidence of SIDS , up to 46 % above the National average . I have spoken with Mr Monroe on several occasions and challenge anyone to find fault with his findings . Universities have -- and failed to find anything to the contrary ! I conducted my own comparisons VBN on monthly rainfall plotted in a graph against monthly occurrences of SIDS from 1985 to 1992 . The graph shows a double mirror image . Not only do the peaks and troughs VBP convincingly , but RB the general downward drift of rainfall from 1985 to 1992 , leading to a drought in the winter of 1992 was followed by an almost identical decline in SIDS . MD it be the humidity / damp in these areas that increases the incidence of SIDS ? Yet in 1997 in the months before and during the last outbreak of NN and mouth NN , the rainfall in Britain was again excessively wet and prolonged . Veterinary surgeon Hugh Peplow of Munnings Mitchell & Peplow remembers the appalling weather conditions of 1967 Notable Features of the Weather ( Monthly weather report . MET Office ) volume : 84 No : 13 Date 21st August 1973 . Summary for the NN 1967 1967 was a rather wet NN . NNP was an exceptionally wet month . Rainfall being over three times the national average over JJ areas of Northern England . Over the NN as a whole it was the wettest NNP since 1773 . The 14th & 15th were the wettest days and noteworthy falls in JJ parts of the NN included CD of 22 mm in 15 minutes at Wollerton Park , Norfolk on the 14th . Heavy storms led to widespread flooding in Lancashire between the 8th and 10th of August ; at Hornby 75 mm of rain was recorded in 15 minutes July : The JJ 10 days were cool with weather mainly dry in the NN - east , but with occasional rain in the NN and west . The 13th marked the beginning of 10 days of thundery weather , thunderstorms were widespread on the 14th & 15th From the 24th a number of rain - belts spread RB - eastwards over the NN . The 27th & 29th were wet in all districts . August : Cool and unsettled weather during JJ week . RB - east mainly dry . Thundery outbreaks from the 8th until the 11th ended violently and with wide spread flooding , especially in Lancashire , where 75 mm of rain fell in 3 hours . NNP - westerly winds brought cooler weather to most districts on the 12th , but from the 14th to the 18th there was a good deal of rain . The 19th to 28th was a generally warm dry period , although in some places remained cool because overnight fog was slow to clear . The last three days were unsettled although NNP - east was mainly dry . The JJ 5 days were generally unsettled , with frequent often severe gales . Prolonged rain , heavy at times , was broken by showery weather during the afternoon of the 2nd and during the 4th Tiree recorded 75 mm of rain during this period . 10th & 11th were generally dull and wet days , other days being fine . 15th & 16th dull but mainly dry . 17th an area of rain moved across most districts and another during the night of 18th / 19th , scattered thunderstorms on the 20th and heavy showers on the 21st were followed by a week of warmer weather and southerly winds , however rain was widespread on the 24th , 25th and 29th . 30th sunny with scattered showers . October ( NNP of the 1967 outbreak of FMD ) ( Source of local information for Oct : Vol 84 same report ) RB 3 days were cool and stormy with widespread rain and gales , 4th bright and showery , but further rain reached RB - west England from the Atlantic on the 5th . Mild JJ - westerly winds occurred on the 6th spreading throughout the NN . A wet period followed , heavy rain on the 8th 9th & 10th led to widespread floods in the Lake District , NNP - west Scotland and NNP Wales . NNP Wales suffered considerable flood damage on the 10th . Great Langdale ( Westmoorland ) recorded 146 mm in 24 hours . 11th Cooler westerly winds brought further rain and temperatures fell too near normal . 12th & 13th were sunny and dry for most of the NN . A wet day on the 14th and Northerly winds brought a sharp drop in temperatures on the 15th . The 16th was the stormiest day of the month and heavy rains led to renewed widespread flooding in Wales and the Midlands . The days rainfall exceeded 50 mm in JJ parts of the Midlands , 85 mm fell at Lwynon ( Brecknock ) . The second half of the month was changeable and rather wet . Gales were severe in places and continued on the 17th from a NNP - westerly direction behind the depression . Thundery showers spread to all districts in this cold NN - westerly NN - stream and NN was reported as far RB as Ringway ( NNP ) . Prolonged sunny periods on the 18th & 22nd Temperatures were above average for the week following the 18th but the last five days of the month were rather cool with widespread rain on the 19th 20th 27th and rain reached all districts late in the day on the 30th 31st widespread rain . The unsettled , stormy and cold weather continued for most of the JJ week . Rain was widespread and heavy locally on most days of this week . Rain reached northern districts on the 24th and spread southwards over the NN bringing to an end 11 dry days at JJ places over Southern England . 27th - unsettled with rain alternating with brighter showery periods . Overnight fog was slow to disperse in the Midlands during the JJ CD days . Rain spread NNP Eastwards across the NN on the night of the 2nd. 3rd mainly fine . NNP westerly winds reached gale force during the next CD days , and rain moving RB . Followed by 5 days of cold Northerly winds which brought NN to all districts . Rain continued on the 11th moving to the NN - east of England for most of the 12th . Widespread rain on the 15th followed by 4 days of cold weather with NN showers and night frosts . 21st to 27th saw milder wet weather , but the 28th saw cold northerly winds with some NN until the end of the month . I have contacted the Ministry Of Agriculture Fisheries and Food ( MAFF ) and the National Farmers Union ( NFU ) and all I got in return was "" not now , this is the wrong NN to consider your work in this field , come back when all of this has blown over . However , my wife heard on the TV days after I had spoken to a veterinary surgeon at MAFF that the outbreak of NN and mouth will subside when the weather changes for the better ! Why the mass slaughter of livestock and disruptions to the farming and tourist industries if the problem will resolve itself when the rain stops ? ( page8 Persistence of NN Is slaughter RB necessary ? PROPOSEL put to MAFF and the NFU Confine a number of affected NNS in a secure , clean containment room with dry bedding food and NN and room for exercise , VB a dehumidifier to remove the moisture from the NN to create a warm dry environment . VB the effects of the improved JJ conditions on the affected NNS for five weeks and VB if they recover ! Having put my proposal to MAFF , which in my opinion MD be simple and cost effective to conduct . No further action looks imminent , instead the mass slaughter continues , as if there is some other hidden agenda behind it , perhaps to VB sure that the future stocks on our farms are free from BSE ? Or simply to VB NN of the surplus meat and dairy produce , which was given away to NNS in Britain a few NNS RB ?

CD official at least VBD that he thought my arguments had some validity , fitting with JJ of the VBN parameters in NN and mouth NN . He VBD that it is thought that the summer months will eliminate the NN and this is thought to be because of the rays from the NN and that it should be investigated further ( Page8 : Persistence of NN ) . I pointed out that my proposal did not involve the NN and that if successful MD prove this point . NN and mouth should be seen as a warning of pending danger . published in their weekly NN INFORMATION of 28 NNP 1999 , Vol. 12 - No. 20 . ) By mid-December 1998 , the NN had spread to Sikamat , about 60 km RB of Kuala Lumpur , through movement of infected pigs . Seven of the 20 workers developed the NN and five died in January 1999 . By March 1999 the NN had spread to the major pig producing area of Bukit Pelandok in the NNP of Negeri Sembilan The NN spread to more farms and , from 1 March to 10 NNP 1999 , a total of 224 suspected NNS of viral encephalitis occurred in Negeri Sembilan with 80 fatalities . Out of a total of 258 persons suspected of being infected with the Nipah NN , 100 have died . In a previously infected farm , more than 95 % of sows had Nipah NN antibodies . More than 90 % of the piglets had antibodies assumed to be maternal antibodies . Antibody prevalence across all ages is currently being studied in an infected farm . END OF COPIED REPORT [ This is the JJ comprehensive report we have seen and MD be the JJ comprehensive report . Japanese encephalitis is no longer being reported as the etiologic agent of Nipah NN and other steps forward obviously have been taken . The overall mortality rate in NNS is 38.8 % . JJ questions remain --- The outlook for FMD in Great Britain 2001 is for a very JJ epidemic . It will grow fast in the next few weeks and continue for JJ months . The number of NNS will rise steeply with rapid expansion in the existing areas in spite of current controls . Estimates vary from 70 NNS a day over the next CD weeks to over 4000 NNS by June 2001 . The Ministry of Agriculture and the Food Standards Agency held a joint meeting on 21 March to receive urgent advice from independent expert epidemiologists . Jim Scudamore ( Chief Veterinary Officer ) , Sir John Krebs ( Chairman FSA ) and Professor David King ( Chief Scientific Adviser ) heard reports from Neil NNP and colleagues ( Imperial College ) Mark Woolhouse ( NNP of Edinburgh ) and opinions from experts at the Institute of NNP NNP and Veterinary Laboratories Agency . The NNS and analysis VBP NNS recorded by MAFF up to CD March 2001 . A brief summary of the available findings is attached ; Imperial plan to publish shortly . The effect of controls on NN movement from 23 February was noted , but all the experts advised the need for further drastic action to bring NN under NN . Otherwise FMD will become established in Britain . Speedier slaughter of infected NNS will VB to reduce transmission . But this needs to be accompanied by immediate slaughter of all susceptible NNS IN infected farms otherwise the final number of NNS will be very high . Depending on the extent of these interventions , the combined strategy MD reduce the epidemic substantially . The experts VBD the last major epidemic in UK 1967 / 8 was quite different . In 2001 more of the NN is affected , sheep are an important reservoir of infection , the scale of dissemination by NN movement was enormous early on . In addition the size of flocks and herds means the scale of operations is very JJ . t is stressed that these are preliminary results , which do not represent a final view from the modelling teams , or from the NN . The external teams have not yet had the opportunity to VB the impact of FMD 's geographic distribution , or of the characteristics of different NNS . NN - and mouth is a devastating NN - but what do we VB about its effects and how it spreads ? NNS : fever , sore throat , blisters or ulcers in the throat and mouth headache a rash with blisters on hands , NNS and diaper area and appetite loss . NN and mouth NN )"

JJ of them lead lives that seem more befitting of rock stars than those of MBAs . Making millions is just CD benefit of a career that includes rubbing elbows with the rich and famous . Making it JJ on Wall Street is something that JJ ambitious professionals set their sights on , especially when they 're fresh out of college . But do n't expect to find the Wall Street job of your dreams in Sunday 's classified section of your local paper . The most glamorous positions RB VBP unadvertised and require more hustle than resume , and more moxie than diploma . These positions are n't always handed out to the boss 's nephew , either , but instead , to those willing to fight tooth - and - nail for a shot . If you 're up for the challenge , here are four of Wall Street 's most glamorous jobs and what it takes to VB them . Although it 's lost a little of its luster since the burst of the dotcom bubble and the nosedive of the JJ markets in 2008 , investment banking is still CD of the most tried - and - true routes to Wall Street riches . Those who have hit the JJ NN can expect to be in the middle of the action when it comes to IPOs , mergers , acquisitions , corporate lending , institutional trading and other JJ - ticket Wall Street transactions . Entry - level investment banking associates do pretty well for themselves , often receiving salaries of $ 100,000 or more in their JJ NN . Within four to five NNS , seasoned investment bankers rising through the ranks can easily earn $ 150,000 to $ 250,000 . If you 've got what it takes to stick RB and VB a key role in a huge deal , you MD easily walk away with a multimillion dollar paycheck . Sound IN the JJ career for you ? If so , then prepare to pay your dues . After getting the mandatory MBA from a top - tier business school , you can plan on moving to NNP York and working 80 to 100 hours IN week as an analyst for the JJ couple of NNS . VB sure to brush up on your accounting and networking skills , too because both are crucial for differentiating yourself from your competition and climbing through the ranks . Stockbroker to the Stars : Rubbing Elbows With America's Richest Only in NNP does an NBA all - star 's entourage include his stock broker . While that MD seem a little extreme , there MD be few NNS more important to an up - and - coming celebrity than an investment advisor and accountant . Because these celebrities receive JJ but intermittent paychecks and no guarantees of future employment , it 's key for them to manage their windfalls wisely . Is the paycheck worth tolerating the paparazzi ? You bet it is . On average , investment advisors to high net worth individuals earn about 1 % IN NN on the assets under their care . So , a broker who manages $ 5 CD for 10 up - and - coming talents MD easily earn $ 500,000 IN NN . Those numbers just keep increasing as your client list grows . Before you set your sights on becoming the next Jerry Maguire of celebrity investing , you need to come to terms with CD fact : you 'll probably VB yelled at — a lot . Athletes , actors and aristocrats tend to be high - performance NNS who are VBN to getting their NN . If you 're not living up to expectations , especially when they compare notes with their wealthy peers , you can bet you 'll hear about it . While a four - NN college degree is more than sufficient to VB you in the door at JJ local branches of JJ Wall Street firms , be prepared to duke it out with every other ambitious broker trying to VB a name for themselves . If you plan on being the NN to VB the JJ - ticket clients , you 'll have to learn how to network your NN through the NN of talent managers , lawyers and accountants . Because most celebrities have no interest in showing up at a Saturday morning investment workshop at your local brokerage branch , they rely heavily on referrals from their trusted circle of advisors . For some NNS , the glory does n't come from closing the JJ deal or hob - nobbing with the elite , it comes from being the best and from outperforming the pack . For that kind of glamour junky , there 's no higher mountain to climb than managing billions of dollars in mutual fund assets . It 's the Olympics of the investing NN , where the winners receive high ratings for their funds instead of gold medals . While the days of a single investment guru managing a fund seem to be on the decline , an entry - level position on a mutual fund management NN can easily earn $ 200,000 to $ 400,000 IN NN before bonuses . Climb the ladder to become a senior NN member or join CD of the most prestigious mutual fund families , and pay can easily exceed $ 1 CD dollars IN NN . Be sure to tuck that NN away though — CD major mistake or bad investment call and there 's a good chance you 'll never manage another fund again . If you feel IN you 're ready to VB behind the wheel of a few CD dollars of other NNS 's nest eggs , you MD need to start in the mailroom of your favorite mutual fund . It 's not uncommon to VB newly minted chartered JJ analysts ( CFAs ) fetching coffee for the JJ guns , in between researching a couple hundred potential NNS IN week , of course . Mutual funds promote heavily from within their own ranks , most often favoring NNS who have proven they can work as part of a closely - knit NN . If there 's a brass ring for those seeking Wall Street glamour , it 's the household recognition of becoming a NN personality . These are the folks who are giving NN commentaries on the JJ channels at the end of the day . They 're the ones with the absurdly lucrative TV , radio and book deals . They are the NN - to NNS for millions of investors and VBP paid astronomical amounts for simply sharing their opinions . Considering that folks IN Suze Orman and Jim Cramer can earn $ 10 CD to $ 20 CD in a bad NN , it 's not hard to VB why Wall Street has become the JJ Hollywood for NNS craving the attention of a home viewing audience . But just IN all true celebrities , fame comes with a price . The more visible the NN , the more the NN is interested in your personal NN and unforgiving of your mistakes . If you VBP you 're ready for your close - up , you 've got CD main options for getting your NN in the door : RB , you can VB your journalism degree and work on finding an entry - level position behind the scenes at CD of the major NN networks . IN JJ other Wall Street jobs , the best positions are given to insiders who have paid their dues . You can plan on spending three to five NNS carrying cords and verifying sources before you VBP that JJ shot at some airtime . Another option is to become a local expert , parlaying your Wall Street wisdom into recurring guest spots on local TV or radio channels . JJ of the biggest names were once hometown favorites who eventually grabbed the attention of CD of the national morning shows . Wall Street is still the greatest bastion of individual capitalism in the NN and a place where determined individuals can work their NN from answering the phones to calling the shots in just a matter of NNS . But the reward does n't come easy , free or fairly . You wo n't find Wall Street glamour simply by working on Wall Street . It RB can't be attained through sheer luck , unless you choose to VB your own . As the famous Roman philosopher Seneca VBD , "" Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity . "" If Wall Street glamour is what you seek , never stop preparing for that moment of opportunity , when you can step in and prove you 've got what it takes ."

She runs a charm school near Tel Aviv , and has a clientele of aspiring politicians , Foreign Ministry officials and former army officers , all seeking to unlearn traditional Israeli behaviour - aggressive , loud and rude . If you VBP I 'm being offensive , this is what she VBD an American audience : "" Israelis will cut in on your conversation and will often interrupt in the middle of a sentence . It is RB quite common for an Israeli to complete your sentence for you . Israelis talk very loudly . "" Mrs Leibovitz , who spends her NN trying to convince Israelis that being polite does not necessarily make CD a weakling or a dupe , VBD the Guardian that the Middle East MD be saved by good manners : "" We have to VB that RB Palestinians are JJ beings ... We do n't VB yet how to speak to other NNS and how to solve problems together . We have to learn that . "" Judging by the reaction of Israel 's Prime Minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , when he was invited to Norway to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Oslo accords this week , peace remains some NN off and Mrs Leibovitz still has work to do . Netanyahu , VBD his spokesman , was too busy . Besides , "" there are more important things ... "" Someone yet to be selected MD be sent , the spokesman went on , before adding : "" I do n't VB the competition for that is too fierce . "" Rude or what ? RECENTLY we learned that the true love of Simone de Beauvoir 's NN was the American writer Nelson Algren , with whom she carried on despite her decades - JJ relationship with her fellow Existentialist , Jean - Paul Sartre . He knew about Algren , apparently , and did not VB the affair . But he had to put up with it , since he demanded the freedom to have amours of his own . Reading the transatlantic correspondence reminded me of a NN VBN by my late aunt , who lived in Paris for JJ NNS and CD day VBD herself sitting at the next table to Sartre and de Beauvoir in a cafe . Thrilled , my aunt leant closer to hear what CD of the greatest minds in France were talking about . The subjects under discussion , it turned out , were their investments and their haemorrhoids . NOW I VBP the Asian JJ crisis is serious . What brought this home was the NN that women in Bangkok 's NN industry are asking to be retrained in some other line of work . Thailand 's education ministry VBZ it is setting up vocational courses after being approached by several "" dancers "" - for which read prostitutes - from Patpong , Bangkok 's infamous red - light district . Some have asked to be taught traditional Thai massage , an eminently more respectable branch of the trade than that practised in Patpong . What this key JJ indicator seems to show is that , despite the cheapness of international flights to Thailand , the NN trade cannot manage without local custom .

But that notion is much too mundane for Julian Barbour . According to the 64 - NN - old British physicist , there 's no point in trying to describe NN , because it simply does n't exist . "" The passage of NN , "" he VBZ , "" is simply an illusion created by our brains . "" This unconventional NN comes from an equally unconventional NN . After completing his doctorate in physics in 1968 , Barbour balked at working in a NN , where he MD have had to teach , worry about raising grant money and persuade deans to give him tenure . Instead he started earning money by translating Russian articles into English - - and did theoretical physics on the side . The riddle of NN had fascinated him all along , and about 15 NNS ago he tackled it in earnest . Recalls Barbour : "" I asked myself , ' How do you VB hold of NN ? It 's invisible ; you can't really VB your hands on it . So what is it really ? ' "" There was n't any good answer . Although physicists work with NN all the NN ( as it were ) , they never define precisely what it is . Barbour RB knew that at least CD physicist , an American named Bryce DeWitt , had managed to meld general relativity and quantum mechanics into a single consistent NN - - a major goal of modern physics -- by removing NN from the equations . But that was generally considered a mathematical trick with no basis in reality . Barbour thought otherwise . Every "" moment "" we experience is real , he VBZ , but these moments exist only for that brief instant , during which NN literally stands still . The passage of NN is as illusory as the sense of movement created by the succession of still frames in a motion picture . Most NNS are wary of abandoning NN , but Barbour 's idea is taken quite seriously by such respected physicists as Penn NNP 's Lee Smolin and the NNP of Alberta 's Don Page . There MD RB be a NN to test it experimentally ; a consequence of Barbour 's NN is that the universe MD be filled with more black holes and neutron stars than experts VBP . If so , we MD VB within a decade whether his NN is supported by astronomical observations -- and whether the ideas of NN we 've clung to for most of JJ history will VB the NN of the ether and the JJ NN ."

NPS / Jim Peaco Most of NNP ’s history ( from the formation of the NN 4.6 billion NNS ago to approximately 541 million NNS ago ) is VBN as the Precambrian NN . Rocks of this age are VBN in northern Yellowstone and in the hearts of the Teton , Beartooth , Wind River , and Gros Ventre ranges . During the Precambrian and the subsequent Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras ( 541 to 66 million NNS ago ) , the western NNP NNPS was covered at times by oceans , sand dunes , tidal flats , and vast plains . From the end of the Mesozoic through the early Cenozoic , mountain - building processes formed the Rocky Mountains . During the Cenozoic era ( approximately the last 66 million NNS of NNP ’s history ) , widespread mountain - building , volcanism , faulting , and glaciation sculpted the Yellowstone area . Magma ( molten rock from NNP ’s mantle ) has been close to the NN in Yellowstone for more than 2 million NNS . Its heat melted rocks in the crust , creating a magma chamber of partially molten , partially solid rock . Heat from this shallow magma caused an area of the upper crust to expand and rise . The Yellowstone Plateau became a geomorphic landform shaped by episodes of volcanic activity . Stress RB caused rocks overlying the magma to break , forming faults and causing earthquakes . Eventually , these faults reached the deep magma chamber . Magma oozed through these cracks , releasing pressure within the chamber and allowing trapped gases to expand rapidly . A massive volcanic eruption then occurred along vents , spewing volcanic ash and NN into the NN and causing fast super - hot debris ( pyroclastic ) flows on the ground . As the underground magma chamber emptied , the ground above it sunk , creating the JJ of Yellowstone ’s three calderas . This diagram shows the general ideas behind CD theories of how magma rises to the NN . Adapted with permission from Windows into the NNP by Robert Smith and Lee J. Siegel , 2000 . Based on minerals from the last major eruption , the researchers VBD that the NNS leading up to an eruption MD happen in a matter of decades rather than thousands of NNS in advance as previously thought . Supervolcanoes are characterized as volcanic centers that have had eruptions that covered more than 240 cubic miles . The US has CD : CD in Yellowstone and another in California ’s NNP Valley . An eruption MD emit ash that MD expand over 500 miles . The eruption MD likely cover the ground with as much as 4 inches of gray ash , which MD be detrimental to crops growing in the Midwest . Another less worrisome concern is the 1,000 degree F molten lava that MD ooze out . Gases , including sulfur dioxide , which contributes to acid rain MD be spewed from the supervolcano and the JJ cooling issues associated with reflecting sunlight away from the NNP are RB concerns . But there are other supervolcanos in the NN with sooner predictions than Yellowstone ’s . Campi Flegri , a name that aptly translates as “ burning fields , is in a “ critical NN , ” according to researchers in Italy . It consists of a vast and complex network of underground chambers that formed hundreds of thousands of NNS ago , stretching from the outskirts of Naples to underneath the Mediterranean NNP . Though its last eruption was in 1538 , it ’s due for an eruption soon . It MD be a minor event compared to the 72 cubic miles of molten rock it spewed in its most notorious eruption 39,000 NNS ago , called Campanian Ignimbrite , that likely contributed to the extinction of the Neanderthals . Fortune website article reported that if the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts , it MD shoot out more than 1,000 cubic kilometers of rock and ash into the air . That ’s 250 cubic miles . That ’s more than three times as JJ as the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption in Italy , which created a sulfurous cloud that floated more than 1,200 miles away to hang over Russia . That ’s 2,500 times more material than Mount St. Helens expelled in 1980 , killing 57 NNS . An eruption at Yellowstone MD result in a cloud of ash more than 500 miles wide , stretching across nearly the entire western NNP NNPS . NASA has a plan to neutralize supervolcano threats however . They VBP the most viable solution MD be to drill up to 6 miles down into the supervolcano , and pump down NN at high pressure . The circulating NN MD return at a temperature of around 662 F , thus slowly day by day extracting heat from the volcano . And while such a project MD come at an estimated cost of around $ 3.46 billion , it comes with an enticing catch which MD convince politicians to make the investment . It MD become a source of geothermal NN . But there are considerable risks , too . It MD trigger the eruption it ’s meant to save us from . Historically , four types of volcanic events have taken place in Yellowstone ( you MD click on each NN to learn more ) : 1 . Caldera Forming Eruptions — 2.1 and 1.3 million NNS ago 2 . Lava Flows — about 30 between 640,000 and 70,000 NNS ago 3 . Earthquakes — 1000 to 3000 yearly ; last notable quake was in 1959 4 . Hydrothermal ( Steam ) Explosions — small explosions in the 20th century ; a dozen or so major explosions between 14,000 and 3,000 NNS ago The likelihood of an eruption in the near future is still low . However those who instigate such a project will never VB it to completion , or RB have an idea whether it might be successful within their lifetime . Cooling Yellowstone in this manner MD happen at a rate of 3.2808399 NNS a NN , taking of the order of tens of thousands of NNS until just cold rock was left .

NNP becoming their next NNP and “ Making America Great Again , ” there are those in the NNP movement and the Scientific community , that are expressing their concerns . Some concerns are justified , while other concerns that are being voiced raise a “ Red Flag . ” We have to wonder how much of these expressed concerns are paranoia from those of “ left leaning ” political views … those with “ Junk NNP ” in their portfolios ( CYA ) … and still others with an agenda that will not hold up under the light of day . Some JJ planners spend their careers mapping out worst - case scenarios . As of January 20 , they ’ve got CD in the White House . There ’s a case to be made that the NNP Administration ’s rollback of JJ regulation wo n’t be devastating ; that market forces will prevail in the coming NN revolution ; that the environment and public NN will continue to be protected under the EPA and other agencies , and that NN governments will do their part as well ; and that a newly - elected NNP , self - branded as an astute businessman and dealmaker , will be open to the wisdom of ensuring a safe and healthy America . But there are CD fatal flaws with this argument : 1 ) You were n’t born yesterday ; and 2 ) You do n’t come to this page to be lied to . The NNP Administration ’s cabinet nominees and transition staff are a wall - to - wall collection of zealots , ideologues and latter - day Robber Barons . Their collective message , both stated and implied , is that the American NN ’s ability to protect the environment , already besieged and underfunded , is on the brink of oblivion . In early December , the cavalcade of aspirants and celebrities seeking an audience at NNP Tower included CD high profile NN activists , former Vice NNP Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio . Gore ’s visit was brokered by the NNP Daughter - Elect , Ivanka NNP . The NNP Administration ’s cabinet nominees and transition staff are a wall - to - wall collection of zealots , ideologues and latter - day Robber Barons . Upon exiting , Gore VBD the press gaggle that meeting with the Trumps was “ extremely interesting . ” Combined with NNP ’s declaration to the NNP York Times that he had an “ open mind ” about NN NN , the wilted spirits of environmentalists were revived . Kudos to Gore and DiCaprio for making their case , but now , let ’s return to NN reality . He ’s not let them down , helping to lead a battle — against the agency he ’ll be in charge of if approved — on the Clean Power Plan , the Waters of the NNP NNPS definition ( WOTUS ) . WOTUS and the Clean NNP Act hold a particular irony , since the anticipated assaults on Section 404 of the Clean NNP Act MD make it easier to drain real , not metaphoric , swamps from coast to coast . A day after Gore ’s meeting , NNP announced the nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt ( Pictured left / Credit : Gage Skidmore / flickr ) to lead the NNP Protection Agency . In his six NNS on the job in Oklahoma , Pruitt has enjoyed the support of keystone local industries , including fossil fuel and poultry . NN : Next was ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson , who vaulted past the likes of Rudy Guiliani and Gen. David Petraeus for the Secretary of NNP nomination . Months away from Exxon ’s mandatory 65 NN - old retirement age , Tillerson was a NN in search of a hobby . Tillerson has acknowledged that JJ - caused NN NN is real , and has endorsed both a NN tax and the Paris NN agreement . He ’s an Exxon lifer , with 41 NNS in the employ of a corporation that ’s buried its own NN affirming NN NN , and that still funds NN denial groups . But do n’t VB he ’s inexperienced in NN or foreign policy . Steve Coll ’s must - read 2012 book “ Private Empire ” makes the compelling case that Exxon functions as a sovereign petro-state , leveraging diplomatic pressure in virtually every corner of the NNP . All VBN , the CEO of Exxon looks to be the most progressive voice on NN NN in the NNP Administration . The CEO of Exxon . As Elizabeth Kolbert , the Pulitzer - winning NNP Yorker writer observed , “ You have to be pretty desperate – and at this point JJ NNS are – to take this as NN for optimism . ” Related : He ’s no Ronald Reagan DOE : Editorial cartoonists and late - night comics love Rick Perry , who , as its potential boss , probably now remembers that Department of NNP was CD of those agencies he ’d VB to abolish . The former Texas governor is actually a big fan of wind power , which he watched become a booming industry in his NN . “ You can be proud that Texas produces more NN from wind turbines than all but five NNS , ” he boasted upon leaving office in 2015 . He ruled over a bonanza in Texas fracking as well , and last NN joined the Board of Directors of NNP Transfer Partners , the builders of the Dakota Access Pipeline . Perry ( Pictured left / Credit : Gage Skidmore / flickr ) has RB VBN that NN NN is a NN to keep NN NNS as wealthy as we all VBP that they are . While DOE has been home to groundbreaking clean NN NN , the bulk of the department ’s mission and budget goes to maintaining the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile , and cleaning up the immense messes left by their manufacture . Since leaving the Texas NNP House , Perry has kept himself busy with an unsuccessful appearance on “ Dancing With the Stars , ” and by turning RB a criminal indictment for abuse of power as Governor . Step lightly , Guv . Interior : Ryan Zinke ( Pictured below / Credit : Gage Skidmore / flickr ) is a JJ - term Montana congressman who accepts that NN NN is real . In the past , he ’s called NN NN a “ threat multiplier , ” but that Obama ’s NN strategies MD unleash “ catastrophic ” JJ costs . An avid hunter , Zinke VBZ he ’d VB to VB more intensive use of federal lands by both sportsmen and oil and NN drillers , and is expected to favor opening controversial export terminals to ship Montana and Wyoming coal across the Pacific . He does have credentials as a “ hook and bullet ” conservationist , including support for the crucial Land and NNP Conservation Fund . That ’s earned him opposition from western anti-environment groups IN the American Land Rights Association . He earned a 3 percent rating from the League of Conservation Voters in 2015 . Unlike JJ on the NNP team , he ’s voiced opposition for turning federal lands over to NNS . Rick Perry ruled over a bonanza in Texas fracking and last NN joined the Board of Directors of NNP Transfer Partners , the builders of the Dakota Access Pipeline . Justice : If approved , Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions MD serve as Attorney General . He ’s VBN that efforts to bring clean NN to developing nations MD be a veritable assault on the NN ’s poorest NNS . He believes CO2 is a benign “ plant food , ” and famously launched a bizarre interrogation of EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy earlier this NN . Enough about the NN / environment bosses . The secondary players MD be considerably worse . JJ of these items are taken from JJ - rate reporting by Lyndsey Gilpin of High Country NNP , and NN by Jenny Rowland and Erin Auel at the Center for American Progress . The CAP researchers documented that nearly every key member of the transition teams for EPA , Interior , and DOE worked for Koch - funded organizations or office - holders . NN : Thomas Pyle , a former lobbyist for both Koch Industries and the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association , leads the transition team . He currently runs the Koch - and Exxon - funded Institute for NNP NNP , a NN tank that ’s espoused a loosening of NN regulations and NN denial while denouncing wind NN . A special moment came on December 14 , when NNP transition team member Anthony Scaramucci appeared on CNN . Anthony Scaramucci , a financial CEO and Fox Business NNP contributor , mixed it up with CNN anchor Chris Cuomo in mid-December . Cuomo repeatedly asked his guest about whether NN NN is real . Citing NNP NNP NN , Scaramucci took a deep dive into the manufacture of doubt . Funny thing : Scaramucci was asked the same question six months ago and declared NN NN to be “ irrefutable . ” For good measure , and possibly with his JJ boss in mind , he added RB in June , “ I find it tragic that so JJ NNS in this country VBP JJ warming is some sort of elaborate hoax perpetuated by every credible scientist on the planet . ” Other NNP Department transition officials include CD more former Koch Industries lobbyists , Mike McKenna and Mike Catanzaro . Catanzaro RB served a stint as Communications Director for uber - denier Sen. James Inhofe . Team member William Greene is Deputy Legislative Director for the Safari Club International , which has lobbied for trophy - hunting exemptions from the Endangered NNP Act . Transitioner Daniel Simmons comes from CD Koch - funded groups , IER and ALEC . Somewhere on this DOE team , an unidentified someone has been “ counseled . ” Those were the announced consequences for distributing a questionnaire to DOE employees that , among other things , sought to identify anyone at the agency who had participated in NN - related meetings . After an uproar , and a refusal by current DOE staff to comply , the NNP team disowned the questionnaire and its McCarthy Era overtones ( In fairness to Senator Joe McCarthy , he was nowhere near as forgiving with the Russians ) . NASA Transition head Chris Shank is the # 2 staffer to House NNP Committee Chair Lamar Smith , and is expected to steer the agency away from its vital NNP NN and NN NN NN . Commerce : The Commerce Department ’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is NASA ’s NN counterpart in NN NN . Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross has made billions on rescuing and leveraging distressed NNS , including coal , oil and NN firms . He ’s acknowledged that NN NN is a thing , offering suggestions to boost rail traffic and invest in ethanol as NN fixes . Ross ’s International Coal Group owned the Sago Mine in West Virginia . In January 2006 , 13 miners were trapped in an explosion at the mine . Only CD was rescued . In 2011 , Ross sold ICG to Arch Coal for a reported $ 3.4 billion . There ’s little indication that NOAA ’s NN NN is nearly as much in the crosshairs as NASA ’s . But , as CD former Commerce official VBD me , “ maybe they just have n’t gotten to it yet . ” EPA : Myron Ebell is a veteran political operative guiding EPA ’s transition team . Ebell dodges the “ denier ” label via a few old NN - denial standards : In the past , he ’s either VBN that NN NN is “ nothing to worry about , ” or that it will be awesome when fewer NNS die from the cold in a warming NN . When hackers stole thousands of emails from NN NNS in 2009 , Ebell described the NN NN community as a “ gang ” that was “ without honor . ” Multiple investigations cleared the NNS of any wrongdoing . RB on the team are attorneys David Schnare and Chris Horner of the American Tradition Institute . Schnare and Horner have specialized in filing lawsuits and sweeping Freedom of NNP Act requests against prominent NN NNS . Bankruptcy filings by coal NNS have revealed their funding for Schnare ’s and Horner ’s work . National Security Team : K.T. McFarland , ( Pictured left / Credit : Gage Skidmore / flickr ) another Fox contributor , MD become Deputy National Security Advisor . She ’s denounced the Obama Administration for citing NN NN as a JJ security issue . Monica Crowley , still another appointee drained from Fox NNP , will handle the press for National Security Advisor Mike Flynn . She recently called JJ warming “ a NN of separating Americans and Westerners from NNP and organized religion , and it ’s RB a wealth redistribution scheme . ” CIA : Wichita - based Congressman Mike Pompeo counts on David and Charles Koch as his constituents . He ’s been a business partner with Koch Industries through an oil supply firm , and has VBN that NNP Obama is “ horribly wrong ” about NN NN posing a JJ security NN . Interior : Doug Domenech is a former Virginia NN official who blames the “ regulatory war on coal ” for tough times in Appalachia , and VBZ that the miracle mineral can relieve NN poverty . But coal jobs have been on a steady swan dive since the Reagan Administration due to mechanization . Other Interior transition staffers include attorney Daniel Jorjani , who works for the Koch ’s Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce . Authors Alyssa Katz describes this effort as having bankrolled anti-regulatory campaigns by the U.S. Chamber and others with $ 255 million in 2012 alone . Congressional staffer Harlan Watson served as chief NN negotiator under NNP George W. Bush . A leaked memo from ExxonMobil , written shortly after Bush ’s inauguration , sang Watson ’s praises and recommended him for a role in NN policy . And a few more : As Transportation Secretary - designate , Elaine Chao MD lead on major infrastructure projects , including the Obama Administration ’s plans to ramp up electric vehicle charging stations nationwide . Chao resigned her seat on the Bloomberg Philanthropies Board in 2015 when the charity decided to increase its support of the Sierra Club ’s “ Beyond Coal ” NN . She is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell – a helpful reminder that sometimes , guilt by association means that you ’re guilty . Linda McMahon , nominee for the Small Business Administration , has cited “ conflicting NN on both sides of this issue . ” The former NNP Wrestling Entertainment executive did n’t VB so far as to declare NN NN is JJ and has a predetermined outcome . Senior Counselor Steve Bannon ’s Breitbart NNP site regularly touts NN denial . Bannon accused the Pope of “ hysteria ” for embracing NN action . Domestic transition head Ken Blackwell believes that NN models are rigged , and the NN is a “ hoax . ” HUD nominee Ben Carson has VBN there ’s “ no overwhelming NN ” on NN NN . Chief of Staff Reince Preibus VBD “ melting icebergs are n’t beheading Christians in the Middle East . ” UN Ambassador nominee Nikki Haley fought the Clean Power Plan as South Carolina Governor , RB as her NN endured lethal , record - smashing downpours . And Vice NNP - Elect Mike Pence has at times VBN NN NN is real , but that NN policy can’t impact it . But he ’s RB called it a “ myth . ” About the author : For questions or feedback about this piece , contact Brian Bienkowski at bbienkowski@ehn.org .

She was visited by CD of her “ hybrid sons ” and was being prepared for a role as a messenger for the Zetas ( Zeta Talk ) . Nancy eventually quit her full NN job in California and moved to Wisconsin to pursue her JJ appointed position as messenger for the Zetas ( Zeta Talk ) . Official NN from the Zetas can be VBN online at Zeta Talk . Since 1995 , the Zetas have been revealing to Nancy plans they have for the JJ race as well as predictions of future events and catastrophes . In the early 2000s , Nancy made a wrong prediction of an event occurring and lost a JJ number of followers , yet a close knit following still remains . The belief is extraordinary because the only evidence is word of mouth . Nancy Lieder is the only contact with the Zetas . She proclaims JJ elaborate facts of realities not yet VBN to mankind and is quite thorough in their descriptions . So far , Nancy has been unable to accurately make predictions of future events stating that the Zetas can be wrong sometimes ( Zeta Talk ) . Nancy RB does not have any physical evidence of the existence of Zetas , but in a NN she posted on NNP , she describes a scene she experienced with a Zeta in such great detail that it MD be surprising if it were not real . But , again , the impressive detail and other anecdotal visions is the only evidence of Zeta existence . In the eyes of those invested in the belief , Nancy Lieder has asserted herself in a position of high credibility and authority through the telling ’s complex rules to live by , predictions of catastrophes , and enlightened happenings of the “ aftertime ” where alien - kind and humankind openly walk amongst each other . Nancy , as the contact , uses modern events IN JJ warming as verification of the Zeta ’s predictions , which her followers VBP . Those who are devout in their belief are misinterpreting real evidence of earthly phenomena as doings of the Zetas . There is a consistent community of Zeta believers on JJ NN , and those that participate in the community are actively adopting this belief more and more into their self concepts . In other words , the belief is taking up residents in their personal identity , which means that being a part of the group who is becoming who they are . When multiple NNS commune with each other in this NN , a bond is formed amongst the group and it becomes larger than they are as individuals . CD of the most prominent aspects of Nancy ’s messages is the “ aftertime ” and what NN after death will look IN . According to Terror Management NN , NNS will pursue meaningful experiences as well as beliefs that buffer against the fear of the inevitability of death . Since Zeta ’s messages expand into description of NN after death , JJ NNS find refuge in the belief that NNS will CD day live amongst aliens . “ Return to Main Page . ” WHO ARE THE ZETAS , www.grantchronicles.com/zeta02.htm."

For starters , the song ’s brain - numbing hook is somewhat infuriating in its own NN . It ’s IN it was written for toddlers . However , the verses make it clear that the actual subject of the song is very adult and very sexual . Here ’s an example of suggestive lyrics : While Bieber is clearly not the JJ artist to release a pop song with sexual innuendo , the promotion surrounding the single makes things extremely weird and uncomfortable . Whoever handler ’s Bieber ’s Instagram account decided it MD be a good idea to post pictures of random babies with the hashtag “ Yummy ” . Here are some examples . Bieber ’s IG account contains JJ more pictures of babies . To make things RB weirder , Bieber RB posted the song ’s title with pizza letters . It is now a widely VBN fact that “ pizza ” is a code word used in pedophile circles . It RB became a meme in internet forums such as 4 Chan . To those who understand the sick codes of these NNS , the combination of the song ’s lyrics with pictures of babies and the word “ Yummy ” written in pizza letters is difficult to ignore . Another widely VBN meme associated with these creeps is pedobear . Here ’s another post on Bieber ’s IG account in the midst of the Yummy promotional blitz . To make things RB stranger , the music NN adds another layer of “ what in hell ? ” The music NN takes place in a posh restaurant that is attended by posh - looking NNS . It ’s the type of place NNS in the elite MD VB to . At the beginning of the NN , the camera lingers on NNS playing music . While the NNS are playing , Bieber enjoys weird food with some weird - looking NNS . Considering the subject matter of the song , PRP can easily interpret that this orgy of food is actually meant to represent an orgy of NNS . The close - ups of NNS suggestively eating food are not very subtle . The final frame of the NN explains what the food in the NN actually represents . That frame is so symbolically important that it was RB posted on Bieber ’s Instagram account . The final frame basically VBZ that the dishes represent NNS . They are being “ tasted ” . And Bieber is a victim of the very system he is celebrating in the NN . What is Happening With Bieber ? Some might wonder why Bieber is partaking in this is creepy and overt NN - loving stuff while he MD , UH , not do it . The short answer is : He does n’t have a choice . Since the very beginning of his career , Bieber was always an industry pawn , with little or no NN over his career . As the last frame of Yummy appears to say , Bieber himself might have been abused by creeps in the music industry . Others wonder why Bieber – who is a devout and outspoken Christian – is partaking in this occult elite stuff . Indeed , there are lots of Jesus - related posts on his IG account ( although weirdly mixed with creepy , Yummy - related pictures ) . However , to VB a better picture of what is happening here , we need to look at Bieber ’s church : The powerful , star - studded Hillsong Church . The Church is famously attended by various stars such as Selena Gomez , Kylie and Kendall Jenner , Kourtney Kardashian , Vanessa Hudgens , Nick Jonas , Hailee Steinfeld , and Bono . All of them are pawns of the occult elite . The founder of the church Brian Houston RB has close ties with the political elite of Australia . All of this elite endorsement happened despite the fact that the Church has a dark secret : The father of the Church ’s founder Frank Houston admitted to abusing several young boys in Australia and NNP Zealand . And the leadership of the Church did everything possible to cover - up this sordid affair . Frank Houston , the father of Hillsong Church founder Brian Houston , was a pastor in NNP Zealand and Australia who abused as JJ as nine boys over the course of his ministry . In the 1960s and ’70s , CD victim was routinely subjected to sexual abuse from the age of 7 to 12 . In 1999 , his mother reported the abuse to the church . Although Brian Houston was legally obligated to report the crime , he did not do so . The victim later testified to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to NNP Sexual Abuse that Frank Houston offered him AU$ 10,000 as compensation at a McDonald ’s in the presence of Hillsong Church elder Nabi Saleh . During an internal church investigation , Frank Houston eventually confessed to the crime . The commission RB heard that he was involved in the sexual abuse of other NNS in NNP Zealand . Frank Houston resigned from his church in 2000 , which then merged with Hillsong Church . Contrary to what is stated in Frank Houston ’s resignation letter , he retired from the position of senior pastor of Sydney Christian NNP Centre in NNP 1999 and was never employed by Hillsong Church . A further internal investigation by Assemblies of NNP in Australia , in conjunction with the Assemblies of NNP in NNP Zealand , VBD six additional NN sexual abuse allegations , which were regarded as credible . In 2015 , the royal commission examined allegations that accused Brian Houston of concealing his father ’s crimes and censured him for failing to report his father to the police . In November 2018 , 60 Minutes aired a segment revisiting the sexual abuse scandal , because newly revealed documentation allegedly reveals that Brian Houston was deeply involved in a cover - up and that Frank Houston ’s abusive behaviour was worse than initially thought . Brian Houston allegedly used his position within the Assemblies of NNP in Australia denomination to conceal his father ’s serial NN sexual abuse . The matter was referred to the NNP South Wales Police Force , which confirmed that Brian Houston was under criminal investigation for failing to report a serious crime . Following the 60 Minutes NN , Hillsong released a statement in response to the allegations . – Ibid . So , to circle RB to the title of the article : Why did Justin Bieber tag babies “ Yummy ” on Instagram ? Because he is a pawn of the entertainment industry which is controlled by some very sick NNS . Since the beginning of his career , Bieber has been caught up in a never - ending whirlwind of strange , humiliating events and has often displayed bizarre behavior . He ’s always been a “ whipping boy ” of the industry and the face of crappy pop music . With Yummy , the pattern continues . His handlers purposely turned Yummy into some kind of “ NN - lover ” anthem by associating it with overt imagery and creepy Instagram posts . In short , Bieber was used to push CD of the elite ’s favorite agendas : The normalization and the celebration of NN abuse . P.S.

NNP YORK ( CNN ) -- We all VBP to live in a NN that 's clean , healthy and prosperous . We all VBP to hand that NN off to our NNS in slightly better shape than we received it . No NN , RB the supposedly evil oil executive , has any reason to VB anything different . But , for some reason , we find ourselves searching for villains . Surely they exist , but the endless quest to create them sometimes overwhelms our better judgment , whether intentional or not . Congress has picked "" Big Oil "" as their enemy of the week . These NNS inexplicably put profits above NNS , ravaging the environment and financially assaulting the poor to put another couple of dollars on their balance sheet . That 's the storyline we 've all been taught . Yes , times are tough for JJ . Sure , oil NNS make a lot of cash . But , for that money , they VBP us to work , VB ambulances to the hospital , keep our homes warm , and employ thousands of our friends and neighbors while financing their retirement , paying their NN care , and providing NN to millions . Because of capitalism , they have the incentive to do that . I 've yet to VB what our NN does for us with their rather JJ chunk of each gallon of NN we buy , and I 've yet to VB them offer to return it or suggest a NN - tax - windfall - tax - tax . The other villain of the moment is the JJ warming "" denier . "" Anyone who disagrees , RB in the slightest , must be ridiculed . On "" 60 Minutes "" last weekend , Al Gore VBD : "" They 're almost IN the ones who still VBP that the moon landing was staged in a movie lot in Arizona and those who VBP the NNP is JJ . That demeans them a little bit , but it 's not that far off . "" Approximately 6 percent of Americans VBP in the JJ moon landing NN , although I 've always heard there was a conspiratorial consensus that it was staged in Nevada , not Arizona . I 'm VBG to guess quite a bit less than 6 percent VB in a JJ NNP , but no NN seems to be asking that question in polls anymore , so I can't be sure . So , who are those NNS Gore was demeaning "" a little bit "" by these comparisons ? There 's a good chance it 's you . That 's because the vast majority of Americans VBP something that categorizes them as a JJ earther to environmentalists IN Gore . Despite the NN 's CD - sided view ( the Business and NNP Institute VBZ dissenting voices about JJ warming are outnumbered on CBS NNP broadcasts by a 38 to 1 ratio ) , only 21 percent of Americans say "" the release of greenhouse gasses is the most important factor causing JJ warming "" according to a 2007 NNP York Times / CBS NNP poll . The "" 60 Minutes "" piece was n't just filled with misrepresentations of opinion ; it had plenty of Gore - style hypocrisy . He was embroiled in controversy when it was revealed his mansion used 20 times more NN than the average American . His explanation ? "" Since then "" his house has been retrofitted with solar panels . I 'm sure Eliot Spitzer has n't been renting JJ women since he was caught either . ( Although I 'm not betting my NN on it . ) We then VBP footage of Gore 's parents ' farm that will , sometime in the future , be run on wind power . Apparently , the windmill store has been out of stock for the past 20 NNS . Perhaps most comically , Gore is seen dragging an entire film crew on a jet to India to give a NN presentation to about 100 NNS . Gore claimed : "" We just do n't have any choice . I wish I knew a better NN to do it . I constantly ask myself , ' How can I be more effective in getting this message across ? ' "" The most effective thing you can VB of is flying halfway across the NN to speak with 100 NNS ? Maybe you had other things to do while you were there , but I 'd be surprised if there was anything essential that MD n't be accomplished with a telephone and a computer . The NNS in India will be able to VB your fancy graphs on their screens , and you 'll cut demand for those evil overseas flights . The entire "" 60 Minutes "" piece felt IN a commercial for Gore 's upcoming commercials . He 's spending $ 300 million in advertising to convince NNS of something he claims there is already a consensus on . To put that much money into perspective ; it 's more than Sen. Barack Obama , Sen. Hillary NNP , Sen. John Edwards , Sen. John McCain , former Gov. Mike Huckabee and Rep. Ron Paul raised in all of last NN combined . VB of it as VBG green by getting lots of green . Where is all that money coming from ? Gore VBZ he 's donating his profits from "" An Inconvenient NNP , "" and his Nobel Peace Prize cash award . Let 's be generous and say there 's only $ 290 million left to explain . Apparently , a follow - up question to find the origins of this nine - figure sum MD have involved six seconds that "" 60 Minutes "" was n't willing to commit . What is there to learn from all of this ? Whether it 's politicians on both sides of the aisle or our vaunted JJ superheroes , the quest for power overwhelms RB the slightest instinct of self - examination . In the end , the timing of the Gore interview airing MD n't have been better . It fell on the same weekend as the JJ "" NNP Hour , "" when the NN supposedly came together to turn our attention to NN NN by shutting the lights off for an hour . The imagery of monuments IN the Sears Tower in Chicago , Illinois , VBG dark was plastered over newscasts everywhere . But those pictures highlighted the JJ warming movement and the congressional attacks on NN NNS in an entirely unintended NN . Behind the darkened Sears Tower was the city of Chicago , with lights shining brightly as far as the eye MD VB . For CD hour the Sears Tower knew what it was IN to be Al Gore : A larger than NN symbol , blocking our view of reality . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer ."

Canada passed bird - friendly lighting ( and construction ) laws in the mid-1990s , and now numerous cities — including Toronto , Washington , D.C. , and NNP York — participate in lights - out campaigns during peak migration seasons . And in 2016 , the American Medical Association responded to the growing NN of evidence suggesting that intense LEDs are harmful to JJ NN by recommending that communities VBP streetlights to “ minimize and VB blue - rich JJ lighting . ” Entire cities are RB re-doing their lights in an attempt to reclaim the night and decrease NN waste . Flagstaff , Arizona , was the JJ city to be designated a Dark Sky Community by the International Dark - Sky Association , and Chicago is in the process of retrofitting its fixtures . So far , hesitations about dimmer , sparser lighting causing an uptick in crime or decreased safety at night have not been supported by the data ; in Chicago ’s West Garfield Park , more brightly lit alleys actually led to an increase in reported crime . And anecdotally , NNS are finding that less glaring lighting makes it easier to VB in unlit areas , because our eyes adapt more quickly to the dark . For some cities , eliminating light pollution is RB a NN to increase tourism revenue while strengthening humanity ’s connection to the night sky . Consider the town of Jasper , Alberta . Nestled in the remote Canadian Rockies , Jasper is a haven for those who love the mountains , wildlife , and the outdoors . Just a few minutes drive outside town , stargazers can VB a dazzling array of nighttime wonders , from oft - hidden stars and satellites to meteorites and the aurora borealis . Since 2010 , the city has hosted a Dark Sky Festival in the fall that brings in thousands of NNS . But Jasper residents are n’t content to have the nighttime wonders visible only just beyond their borders . The town is now working with Lumican , a Canadian NN that partners with the International Dark - Sky Association , to re-do all its streetlights . Slated to start this summer , the town ’s roughly 400 fixtures will be replaced with shielded Lumican LEDs set to color temperatures ranging between 1,700 and 2,200 Kelvin , which efficiently cast an amber glow while limiting more harmful blue wavelengths . “ What caught our attention at RB was how horrible all these JJ LED street lights looked ; so glary , prison - UH , and overly bright , ” VBZ Lumican ’s Lara Mitchell . When she realized that such street lighting erases stars and damages ecosystems , the NN turned toward fighting light pollution . Throughout North America and Europe , dark sky parks are on the rise , and festivals IN Jasper ’s are flourishing . NNS are beginning to reconnect with the sparkling canvas that swirls overhead just as technologies are becoming available on scales that will VB humanity reclaim more of this natural nighttime majesty — if we choose to use them . Christopher Kyba , the scientist who studies light pollution on a JJ level , points to van Gogh ’s “ Cafe Terrace at Night ” as his image of an ideal nighttime scene . “ This is the dream of what you VBP to have — nice , warm , uniform lighting . You can VB lots of stars up above , the facades are unlit , ” he VBZ . “ You look a hundred - something NNS in the past to VB the idealized lighting . ”"

Woe to the inhabiters of the NN and of the NN ! for the devil is come down unto you , having great wrath , because he knoweth that he hath but a short NN . 13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the NN , he persecuted the woman which brought forth the NN NN . 14 And to the woman were given CD wings of a great eagle , that she might fly into the wilderness , into her place , where she is nourished for a NN , and times , and half a NN , from the face of the serpent . 15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth NN as a flood after the woman , that he might VB her to be carried away of the flood . 16 And the NN helped the woman , and the NN opened her mouth , and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth . 17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman , and went to make war with the remnant of her seed , which keep the commandments of NNP , and have the testimony of Jesus Christ .

They_PRP ’re_VBP much_RB more_RBR invested_VBN ”_''","On Reddit , some “ Game of Thrones ” fans subscribe to a tortuous NN that a group of old , scholarly men — the maesters — are part of a sprawling and hidden NN to exert NN over the show ’s mythical kingdom . They write thousands of words to each other proving that every obscure clue adds up to a big picture that only they can VB . Just a few clicks away , other Reddit users are sure that a secretive group — the Illuminati — is part of a sprawling and hidden NN to VB the real NN . They do exactly the same thing . There are some clear parallels between fan NN theories and political NN theories . They were once confined to the far corners of American culture , but in recent NNS have flourished thanks in part to internet message boards and JJ NN , which offer anyone the opportunity to publish , debunk , rebunk and remix their own imaginary concepts and share them with RB - minded theorists . The theories , however , share more than just message boards . The psychology of groups and the internet ’s propensity to amplify outlandish content and reward the NNS who create it has created the kind of feedback loops in which bizarre theories — from both fantasy fans and the politically paranoid — flourish . Russell Zimmerman , 41 , a writer , game developer and military historian , loves to theorize about “ Game of Thrones , ” particularly the books on which it is based , George R.R. Martin ’s series , “ A Song of NNP and Fire . ” But some theories are RB too much for him , such as CD that argues CD character ( Varys , the spymaster ) is secretly a NN NN . “ To me , that 's about the level of ‘ out there ’ crazy - talk as assuming there 's a kiddie porn ring in the basement of a pizza shop without a basement , ” he VBD , referring to the “ NN ” NN NN that remains popular on the fringes of the far NN . “ Thrones ” is not the only show with a strong internet following and crackpot theories . The popular Adult Swim show “ Rick and Morty ” has various fan guesses at the show ’s secrets . BBC ’s “ NNP Who , ” which follows a NN - traveling NN - looking alien exploring the universe , has its own theories . And in the early days of the consumer internet , “ The X - Files , ” a show that often touched on real - NN NN theories , gave birth to some of the JJ online fan theories . Meanwhile , any number of real - NN NN theories have taken hold among various political and JJ groups on the internet . Joseph Uscinski , associate professor of political NN at the NNP of Miami and author of “ NNP Theories and the NNPS Who VBP Them , ” VBD diehard fans and NN theorists share a love of extrapolating from the facts in their possession . “ NN theories are similar to fan fiction in that they both allow NNS to make up whatever they VBP , ” he VBD . Uscinski VBD that whether it ’s “ Game of Thrones , ” “ Star Wars ” or the JFK assassination , NNS can take a plot or an event and “ VB to wherever they VBP with it . ” As an example , Uscinski cited Qanon , a remarkably popular genre of NN theories that generally center on a mysterious figure who claims that NNP Donald NNP is working to uncover a powerful group of pedophiles . “ You have this anonymous poster , Q , who puts out nonsensical clues and NNS try to make sense of it and try to figure out what happens next , ” he VBD . “ They are enjoying this . They VBP piecing these things together . It ’s a fan thing for them . ” Brendon Boutin , 32 , who runs a popular “ Game of Thrones ” recap channel , “ NNP of Recaps , ” VBD the excitement generated by both kinds of theories drove their popularity . “ I VBP the biggest similarity is the feeling you VBP , the rush of hunting for the NN and discovering secret knowledge , ” Boutin VBD by email . “ I watched some 9/11 ‘ NN ’ videos RB in the day , and those brought about the same thrill as discovering Jon Snow 's parentage . ” “ Game of Thrones ” is far from the only show to have a fervent fanbase that has created its own theories , but few have created a community as rich and active , both online and off . Laurel Steinberg , a NNP York - based relationship therapist , VBD the behavior shown by NN theorists and superfans is “ absolutely analogous . ” “ NNS VBP to feel part of a group , part of a movement , part of a team , ” Steinberg VBD . “ It feels good to have something that gives them a identity . It feels good to have something to be excited about , and watch develop in real NN . ” But “ Thrones ” fandom is RB susceptible to the same internet dynamics that have spurred ever - more outlandish NN theories , rewarding NNS who can draw the most attention . “ You 're able to create community , and then become an expert . You ’ve ridden the tailcoats of the star and then you become a breakout star in that community , ” Steinberg VBD . ” You become an influencer . ” Chloe Ketchum , 27 , who co-hosts a podcast about the series , “ Girls Gone Canon , ” VBD that while she enjoys the feeling of community around “ Game of Thrones , ” she ’s RB seen the lengths some fans will VB to attract a following . “ There are creators that push shock value to VB views , ” Ketchum VBD . “ NNS will do anything for attention . ” While there are similarities in the psychology behind intense fandoms and political conspiracists , Uscinski stressed that they result in divergent behaviors . He VBD fans will generally abandon theories that do n’t hold up , whereas NN theorists ignore evidence that proves them wrong . There ’s RB the real - NN consequences . NN theories around politics and current events have inspired some NNS to commit acts of violence , which has led to efforts by politicians and activist groups to force internet platforms to reign in the spread of the disinformation that can fuel the theories . “ When the show comes out , NNS will disregard their theories that did n’t turn out to be true , ” he VBD . “ But with JJ earthers , when they do an experiment and it does n’t show them what they VBP , they still hold that belief anyway . They ’re much more invested ”"

NNP supporters had RB dismissed concerns about her NN as baseless , insisting that she only suffered from allergies . But Sunday ’s incident — along with a NN appearing to show NNP having difficulty standing on her own — will only amplify such questions just as the race enters its final weeks . The incident RB MD increase pressure on NNP , 68 , and Republican nominee Donald NNP , 70 , to release more NN about their NN . NNP has disclosed less than some previous candidates . Donald NNP has released almost nothing . “ This is the kind of thing that voters have a NN to understand before they cast a vote , ” VBD Katie Packer , a GOP strategist who VBZ she does not support either NNP or NNP . “ Both NNP and Hillary are elderly . They are obligated to release full medical records and full tax returns to the American NNS . And the NN , party leaders and American NNS should settle for nothing less . ” The pneumonia diagnosis comes as the NN enters its most grueling phase , weeks before the JJ presidential debate and as voters start heading to the polls in NNS with early voting . Her NN , who made the diagnosis Friday , has advised NNP to curtail her schedule . But the Democratic candidate did not appear to skip any planned events over the weekend , including a fundraiser in NNP York headlined by Barbra Streisand . After the incident , NNP ’s NN VBD late Sunday it was canceling a planned trip to California on Monday and Tuesday for fundraisers and a taping of “ The Ellen DeGeneres Show . ” NNP ’s lung infection comes after a tough week for her NN , with polls showing a tightening of the race against NNP . Then over the weekend , NNP was forced to partially walk RB comments she made referring to half of NNP ’s supporters as “ deplorables . ” The JJ scrutiny of her NN will add to these problems . “ Forty - eight hours ago , this was something for the NNP NNP Society and the birth certificate deniers , ” Dan Schnur , director of USC ’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics , VBD of the speculation about NNP ’s NN . “ Now it ’s a topic of legitimate , mainstream political discussion . ” Although NNP ’s opponents will surely make an issue of her having pneumonia , her NN ’s relatively quick release of the diagnosis marked a significant step toward transparency for a candidate who has often shied away from disclosing NN she considers private . But some critics complained that NNP did not reveal the potentially debilitating condition Friday when it was diagnosed . And after she fell ill Sunday morning , her NN initially attributed it to “ overheating ” and waited nearly seven hours — as rumors and speculation about her NN swirled — until disclosing the pneumonia . For NNP , perhaps the most damaging part of the day was the CD - second NN of her struggling to leave the event in NNP York City . The NN , quickly circulated online and replayed on cable NN channels , shows her standing uneasily , her knees appearing to buckle and needing NN to VB into her van . A spokesman VBD immediately afterward that NNP left the ceremony at the site of the NNP Trade Center about 9:30 a.m. because she felt unwell . Reporters who were traveling with NNP were not VBN about her condition or her whereabouts for 90 minutes after she left the ceremony . “ Secretary NNP attended the Sept. 11th commemoration ceremony for just an hour and 30 minutes this morning to pay her respects and greet some of the families of the fallen , ” spokesman Nick Merrill VBD in the initial statement released by the NN . “ During the ceremony , she felt overheated so departed to VB to her daughter ’s apartment , and is feeling much better . ” The weather was in the low 80s and humid . NNP spent about CD hours at Chelsea NNP ’s apartment and emerged shortly before noon wearing sunglasses , greeting a young girl and waved at diners at a nearby restaurant . “ I ’m feeling great . It ’s a beautiful day in NNP York , ” NNP VBD before heading to her home in Chappaqua , N.Y . Her personal physician examined her at her house Sunday afternoon and VBD NNP was recovering . “ While at this morning ’s event , she became overheated and dehydrated . I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely , ” VBD Dr. Lisa R. Bardack in a statement . Bardack VBD NNP was put on antibiotics Friday . NNP ’s NN has RB been the speculation of NN theorists . In 2014 , a NNP magazine cover of NNP in her backyard leaning on a chair prompted speculation that she was leaning on a walker . But innuendo about her NN grew markedly during the presidential NN as NNP and his surrogates , including former NNP York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani , routinely questioned her strength and stamina on the NN trail . NNP was uncharacteristically silent Sunday after NN of NNP ’s illness emerged . Republicans have RB pointed to coughing fits that NNP has suffered while campaigning , and which she attributes to seasonal allergies . Her opponents have RB raised questions about the effect of a concussion she sustained in 2012 . The drumbeat got to the point that NNP poked fun at it on late - night television . During an August appearance on “ Jimmy Kimmel Live , ” she pretended to exert great effort as she opened a jar of pickles and asked the host to check her pulse . NNP dismissed the attacks as “ wacky ” and noted that critics have claimed “ I MD be dead in six months , ” she VBD . “ So with every breath I take I feel IN I have a JJ lease on NN . ” For the latest on national and California politics , follow @LATSeema on NNP .

JJ ancient cultures subscribed to the idea but it was made famous again in modern times thanks to the creation of a NNP NNP society by Samuel Shenton in 1956 . Mark Sargent , an avid member of the club and author of several books on the topic , revealed CD reason why he believes it is more than just a NN . Speaking during Netflix documentary “ Behind the Curve ” , Mr Sargant claimed his NN was superior to everything NASA has VBN us for NNS . Taking the production crew to a beach near his home , Mr Sargant pointed at the city of Seattle across the NN . He VBD in 2018 : “ Here ’s an example if you VBP to VB it real quick . “ So UH the buildings in the distance – RB out there – that is Seattle . “ You should not be able to VB it . “ There should be hundreds of NNS of curvature between us and them . ” Mr Sargant went on to dismiss any scientific reasoning for the revelation , before claiming the NNP NNP NN answers all the questions . He added : “ You can say it ’s refraction , or it ’s atmospheric effects , no – not in every weather condition , not in every light condition . “ This is why NN is having a problem combating what we are doing . “ Neil deGrasse Tyson VBZ it ’s a growing anti-intellectual movement which borders on the end of civilisation as we VBP it . “ But the reason why we ’re winning versus NN , is NN just throws RP maths . Neil deGrasse Tyson is an American astrophysicist author and leading NN figure . He has been a JJ NN supporter of NASA , claiming the NN agency deserves more funding and backing by the general public . In March 2012 , he testified before the NNP NNPS Senate NNP Committee , stating : "" RB now , NASA 's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar . "" For twice that – a penny on a dollar – we can transform the country from a sullen , dispirited nation , weary of JJ struggle , to CD where it has reclaimed its 20th - century birthright to dream of tomorrow . "" Mr Tyson RB runs his own NNP channel – StarTalk – where he has previously called out NNP Earthers . He VBD in March 2018 : “ We have videos from NN of the rotating spherical NNP – the NNP is round ."

One_CD lucky_JJ winner_NN already_RB got_VBD his_PRP$ shirt_NN :_:","“ The folksiness will irk some critics … But criticizing Friedman for humanizing and boiling down big topics is IN complaining that Mick Jagger used NN to sell songs : It is what he does well . ” – John Micklethwait , review of Thank You for Being Late , in The NNP York Times With apologies to Mr. Micklethwait , the hands that typed these lines implying Thomas Friedman is a Mick Jagger of letters should be chopped off and mailed to the singer ’s doorstep in penance . Mick Jagger MD excite the NN in CD note , while Thomas Friedman needs 461 pages to say , “ Shit happens . ” Joan of Arc and Charles Manson had more in common . Thomas Friedman was once a NN of great influence . His columns were must - reads for every senator and congressperson . He helped spread the globalization gospel and push us into war in Iraq . But he ’s destined now to be more famous as a literary figure . No modern writer has been lampooned more . Hundreds if not thousands of man-hours have been spent teaching robots to produce automated Friedman - prose , in what collectively is a half - vicious , half - loving tribute to a NN who raised bad writing to the level of an art form . We will remember Friedman for interviewing 76 percent of the NN ’s taxi drivers , for predicting “ the next six months will be critical ” on 14 occasions over CD and a half NNS ( birthing the neologism , “ the Friedman unit “ ) , and for his unmatched , NNP - given ability to write nonsensical metaphors , IN his classic “ rule of holes ” : “ When you ’re in CD , stop digging . When you ’re in three , bring a lot of shovels . ” Friedman ’s great anti-gift is his ability to use JJ words when only a few are necessary . He became famous as a newspaper columnist for taking simple CD - sentence observations IN , “ Wow , everyone has a cell phone these days , ” and blowing them out into furious 850 - word trash - fires of mismatched imagery and circular argument . The double - axel version of this feat was to then rewrite that same column over and over again , in the same newspaper , only piling on more incongruous imagery and skewing rhetoric to further stoke that CD thought into an RB higher and angrier fire . For nearly CD decades now , Friedman has been telling us that something big is happening , technology is growing at a rate beyond the ability of humans to adapt ( this is where the part about noticing everyone has a cell phone comes in ) , and that we have to stop doing things the old NN and take a brave step into the future . He wrote this column so JJ times that RB four NNS ago – eight Friedman units – Hamilton Nolan wrote a piece in Gawker titled “ Thomas Friedman writes his only column again ” ( Friedman ’s “ only column ” has by now outlived hundreds of NN outlets , Gawker and my own NNP York Press among them ) . Nolan cited a piece in the Times called “ The Rise of Popularism , ” in which Friedman argued , again , that technology was racing past humanity ’s ability to govern itself wisely . A very conservative guess is that Friedman has written this column at least a hundred times . Maybe 200 . Maybe more . If you ’re rolling your eyes at this , check yourself . VB about what an awesome accomplishment that is . It takes an extraordinary discipline to turn CD sentence of thought into hundreds of thousands of words . We all repeat ourselves in the punditry business . Most of us only have a few ideas . Friedman has fewer than most – it ’s really just CD , technology future derp ! – but he ’s attacked that CD idea with such relentless evangelical NN that he is leaving behind as a monument to it the literary equivalent of the Giza pyramid complex . This decades - JJ gigantic art project is based upon a vast architecture of needless complication , a process he describes in this JJ book of his , Thank You for Being Late , as “ translating English into English . ” Build a sentence into a column ; build a column into JJ columns ; build JJ columns into a book ; build CD book into JJ books . Then start over ! Eleven NNS ago , when Friedman wrote his seminal explainer book , The NNP is NNP – a book whose title metaphor was hilariously based on the wrong premise that NNS are more interconnected on a JJ NN than on a round CD – he combined CD giant sets of metaphors to describe that same idea that technology was outpacing our ability to govern ourselves . He VBD rapid NNS in the NN were being fueled by 10 “ flatteners ” ( things IN the end of communism , Netscape , outsourcing , etc. ) which in turn were amplified by he VBD were four “ steroids ” : Digital , Mobile , Personal and Virtual . Those four steroids actually turned out to be six – changing or extending the terms of his imagery midstream is a classic Friedmanism – and the sixth “ steroid , ” JJ wireless devices , was actually a JJ group of steroids he called “ uber-steroids . ” This was confusing because the tenth item in Friedman ’s list of “ flatteners ” was the group of four steroids . So his last flattener was a JJ group of steroids and his last steroid was a JJ group of uber - steroids . Which meant we had uber - steroids amplifying steroids amplifying flatteners , with each list comprising items that belonged to other lists . He mashed all of that together for 470 pages or so . Eleven NNS and countless columns later , the JJ book Thank You for Being Late takes that same structure and boldly complicates it . This book is built , again , around the idea that technological NN is advancing beyond our ability to adapt . The culprits this NN are three great “ Accelerations ” : Moore ’s Law ( microchip processing power doubles every 18 to 24 months ) , the market ( globalization ) and Mother Nature , which is his English - language term for the English - language term , “ NN NN and biodiversity loss . ” These Three Accelerations in turn are transforming five key “ realms , ” which he lists as “ the workplace , politics , geopolitics , ethics , and the community . ” If you ’re wondering what ’s left over when you subtract , from the subset of all things , “ the workplace , politics , geopolitics , ethics , and the community , ” you ’re on to something . Because it turns out that the book is about how something is happening to – everything ! “ In short , ” Friedman VBZ , in the opening chapter of Late , “ this book is CD giant column about the NN today . ” Incidentally , whenever Friedman uses the phrase , “ In short … ” he ’s about to take the short form of an idea and make it longer , e.g . “ In short , the only NN for Mexico to thrive is with a strategy of reform retail that will enable it to beat China to the top , not the bottom , because China is not focused on beating Mexico as much as it is on beating America . ” To his credit , in Thank You for Being Late , Friedman debuts the use of , “ To make a short NN RB , ” which is n’t exactly fixing the problem . But it is funnier . So how giant is this JJ giant column ? Really giant . There are n’t enough drugs in the NN to VB anyone through Thank You for Being Late in CD sitting . Take the chapter about Mother Nature , which opens with a NN about a day in July , 2015 when the heat index in southern Iran reached 163 degrees . That NN item gives the author an opening to introduce the concept of a “ black elephant , ” an ominous ( if you VBP Friedman ) term apparently explained to him by environmentalist Adam Sweidan : “ [ It is ] a cross between a ‘ black swan ’ – a rare , low - probability , unanticipated event with enormous ramifications – and ‘ the elephant in the room ’ : a problem that is widely visible to everyone , yet that no NN wants to address , RB though we absolutely VBP that CD day it will have vast , black - swan - JJ consequences . ” You MD VB he MD just say , “ The NN NN problem is a cross between a black swan and the elephant in the room – or , as I VBP to call it , a Black Elephant . ” Instead he leads audiences through drawn - out explanations of CD everyday terms . Moreover his unnecessary definition of “ the elephant in the room ” contains the phrase “ black swan , ” making what was originally a relatively simple idea now a kind of circular movie - within - a - movie image that is more than a little hard to follow : “ A black elephant is a cross between a black swan event and the elephant in the room , which is an ignored but visibly obvious problem that will inevitably become a black swan event . ” You ’re still grappling with that when you learn “ there are a herd of JJ black elephants out there . ” Friedman names at least four : JJ warming , deforestation , NN acidification and mass biodiversity extinction . He quotes Sweidan as saying of these : “ When they hit , we ’ll claim they were black swans that no NN MD have predicted , but in fact they were black elephants , very visible RB now . ” Friedman just got finished telling us that a black elephant is half black swan , and half elephant in the room that will inevitably become a black swan . But now that half - swan , half swan - within - an - elephant is being contrasted with a black swan : in the near future , things that are really black elephants will be misidentified as black swans . So that ’s weird . While you ’re sorting that out , Friedman tells you that the you that a 163 - degree heat index in Iran is another black elephant , because “ you can VB it sitting in a room , you can feel it , and you can read about it in the newspaper . ” He adds : “ IN any black elephant , you RB VBP that it is so far outside the norm that it has all the characteristics of a black swan – that it is the harbinger of some very big , unpredictable NNS in our NN system we MD be unable to VB . ” The next thing he VBZ is that we spend tons of money preparing for the relatively unlikely event of nuclear war , but virtually nothing to prevent a very likely NN NN catastrophe . He MD have just led the chapter with that . But that MD defeat the purpose of translating English into English . You ’re still wondering what happened to that elephant reading a newspaper about a black swan roasting in the desert when Friedman moves on to the next NN - devouring exercise , telling us about the four phrases we need to master to learn “ NN - speak . ” All four sound IN the same idea and are immediately forgettable : “ Just a few NNS ago … but then something changed . ” “ Wow , I ’ve never seen that before . ” “ Well , usually , but now I do n’t VB anymore . ” “ We have n’t seen anything IN that since . ” Quick , name any of those phrases you just read . You can ’t ! But you “ have to master ” all of them to grasp the rapidity of NN disturbances , which Friedman now describes as Mother Nature moving into the “ second half of the chessboard . ” This is a reference to a metaphor from an earlier chapter recalling the ancient tale of the mathematician who asked a king for a reward . The master asked to have CD grain of rice put on CD corner of a chessboard , and then to have twice as JJ put on the next square , and to keep VBG , on and on to the end . The punchline is that after doubling down 64 times , you end up with 18 quintillion grains of rice or something – more than you ’d have guessed ! Which is a metaphor for how much faster than we VBP is the pace of NN all around us , be it in technology , JJ displacement or , in this case , the environment . Did you VB that “ megatoothed sharks prowled the oceans ” the last NN the CO2 concentration in the NN ’s NN was as high as it was in Hawaii on NNP 3rd , 2013 , an astonishing four hundred parts per million ? You probably did n’t , because things that prowl usually have NNS – but anyway , RB to the elephants : “ And sometimes the records being broken as Mother Nature enters the second half of the chessboard are so numerous and profound , NN agencies tracking them seem to run out of RB NN - speak to describe the black elephants they are seeing . ” This must be that talent for “ boiling things down ” that Mr. Micklethwait talked about ! NNP bless this NN . MD he never stop writing books . Let ’s grow this pie as big as we can . P.S. winners of the extraordinary # friedmangraphs contest to be announced soon .

Taking your pen and paper , draw the symbol of choice on it . # 6 – Take your candle and place it on top of the symbol you just drew , doing your best to center it on the image . Using your leaves and / or flowers , create a visually appealing or ‘ pretty ’ display . Follow your heart , it will provide you with the direction of where to place everything . # 7 – Find a comfortable NN of sitting close to your candle . If you are sitting up to a table , make sure that your NNS are JJ on the floor in order to ground yourself throughout the remainder of the ritual . In the same NN , if you are seated on the floor , find a position that leaves you feeling ground and secure . # 8 – Place CD hand over your heart , another on your belly . The exact location will be guided by your intuition . Close your eyes , taking 10 deep breaths . Shut out all outside distractions , focusing only on your breathing in the moment . # 9 – Take a single flower or leaf from alongside your candle , placing it in the palm of your hand . Looking closely at the item , recite the following three times : “ I trust the NN of Mother NNP . She guides me as to what in my NN I need to release . ” # 10 – Ensuring that the flower or leaf remains in the palm of your hand , bring your hands together into a prayer position . Close your eyes , focusing on your breathing again until you feel completely calm , then repeat the mantra from the previous point . # 11 – Continue to hold onto your flower or leaf as you stand up and start to shake out your NN . As you do so , visualize all the NN , anxiety , and hurt falling free from your NN . Continue to shake until you feel as though all the negativity has been released , leaving you cleansed and pure . # 12 – Carefully sitting RB down , hold up your leaf or flower and exhale onto it , releasing any remaining negative NN or anxiety into the object . Place the flower or leaf off to the side , ensuring that you VBP which it is . You need to properly dispose of this item in order to remove this negative NN from your NN once and for all . # 13 – Pick up another flower or leaf , placing it in the palm of your hand just as you did the last .

She both supports and nourishes my soul . ” # 14 – Just as you did the last NN , bring your hands into the prayer position with the flower or leaf between your palms . Close your eyes and take 10 deep , JJ breaths . With each of the JJ 9 breaths , visualize clean , pure NN coming into your NN . On the 10th breath , open your eyes looking at the flower or leaf .

Recite the following : “ I call on my guardian angel and my spirit guides to VB me to stay calm and embrace peace . I trust that the NN of Mother NNP is always working to guide me and protect me . I genuinely appreciate the NN that Mother NNP is working in my NN . I appreciate all the divine beings , spirits , and guardians that work to support me , encourage me and assist me on my NN ’s journey . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . ” # 17 – This is the end of your ritual . Blow out the candle to finish .

This can be done by releasing them from the top of a tall building or hill into the wind , throwing them into the NN or burying them in a garden or wooded area . You can choose to dispose of the alter you have created , or to leave it set up as a reminder of the peace that you have accepted into your NN ."

That VBN , the topic is certainly a fresh NN for NNP beef . NNS have recognized the curvature of the NNP for more than 2,000 NNS . But rapper B.o.B. challenged that view on Sunday when he began tweeting images and diagrams that he VBD were proof the NNP is as JJ as a 45 . Did we mention B.o.B. is promoting a JJ album ? Well he is . But he insists those things are definitely not related . So far , B.o.B. -- nee Bobby Ray Simmons -- has posted almost 50 images of the supposedly JJ planet , along with quotes from the 2014 book “ The NNP NNP NNP ” by Eric Dubay . Thousands of fans retweeted B.o.B. ’s claims that “ I ’m VBG up against the greatest liars in history ... you ’ve been tremendously deceived ” and “ I question the international laws that prevent you from exploring Antartica and the North Pole ... what ’s there to hide ? ” Usually , when a prominent scientist steps forward to set the record straight , that ’s the end of the conversation . But not for B.o.B . He tweeted a song he ’d written , “ Flatline , ” in which he insists “ Neil Tyson need to loosen up his vest ” and ponders why NASA is part of the Department of Defense . ( Actually , it ’s not . ) Then , in a move B.o.B. probably did n’t VB coming , Tyson dropped a diss track RB at him . The rapper Tyson was referring to was his nephew , Steve Tyson , who goes by “ Tyson . ” He wrote and recorded the song “ JJ to Fact . ” In an interview with The Times , Tyson the rapper VBD he came up with the idea of writing a song in his famous uncle ’s defense after texting with him Tuesday morning “ I recorded it in my living room , ” Tyson VBD . “ I wrote it in a couple hours and just hit record and started recording it as a track . ” His uncle recorded himself reading some of his tweets to use in the song . Not everyone was persuaded . JJ followers s eemed eager to jump on the JJ NNP bandwagon B.o.B. was all too eager to retweet them . Perhaps Laura Danly will be more convincing . the curator of the Griffith Observatory , kindly agreed to address a few of B.o.B. including why you ca n’t VB the curvature of the NNP . “ The NNP is just big , ” she VBD . “ You look out to the horizon and it looks JJ . But if you VBP into NN you can VB the curvature . ” B.o.B. asserts that we have no photos of a curved NNP that were n’t “ taken ” by NASA . That ’s not true either : the NNP , including China in 2014 and Japan just last NN . Other things that prove the NNP is round : The fact that we can observe sunrises and sunsets . The fact that NNS in different hemispheres VBP different constellations . The fact that you can fly around it in a straight line . So for the record , the NNP : definitely round .

Over the course of the early modern period , the ‘ NN ’ of the Netherlands opened up in several productive ways . Perhaps most famously , the Dutch created the JJ NN of the Republic : viable political NN , demarcated from an older collection of provinces , which had been gathered most recently under the auspices of the king of Spain . The Dutch RB expended tremendous effort reconstituting the physical NN of the Low NNPS : land reclaimed from NN and increased urban centres , which allowed the Republic to grow in population and gain in arable terrain . And the Dutch enlarged their commercial and colonial NN by dint of their numerous overseas expansions : a ‘ NNP ’ Netherland ( almost always referred to in singular form ) , which arose on the eastern shores of what was already then called North America ; a modern ‘ Batavia ’ , which emerged in present‐day Indonesia ; and a host of Dutch forts and settlements that otherwise dotted the coasts and islands of Asia , Africa and the Americas . The Dutch RB developed , just as famously , JJ pictorial devices to engage with NN – the painterly and printerly techniques explored in this issue – and , not unrelated , JJ techniques to map spaces : the most robust cartographic ateliers of early modern Europe , which developed RB in Antwerp and then in Amsterdam from the late sixteenth century , coincident with the rise of the Dutch Republic and the Golden Age of Dutch visual culture . Maps proliferated in the early modern Netherlands . They offered a means both to delineate NN and to narrate NN – to explicate how NN works and to assert where their makers ( and consumers ) fit within these spaces . Yet maps were RB important and ubiquitous material objects in the Netherlands , which occupied myriad additional spaces and which played with the JJ spatial and material concerns of their viewers . They engaged viewers and enticed them into their interpretive spaces . How do Dutch maps work , and what does this reveal about the visual culture of the early modern Netherlands ? These questions were famously tackled by Svetlana Alpers in The Art of Describing mostly in regard to landscape painting . Yet in JJ ways , her influential essay on ‘ The Mapping Impulse in Dutch Art ’ – the NN ‐to source for non ‐Dutch specialists , particularly historians of NN who seek to affiliate their concerns with habits of natural ‐history representation with a broadly northern European tradition of painting – curiously avoided the key to this intriguing interpretive palace : the maps themselves and how they actually function . 1 While Alpers ’ oft‐cited chapter does open with Vermeer 's Allegory of Painting and the impressive wall map by Claes Jansz . Visscher that amply fills its background , maps are otherwise relegated to the side , treated sparingly and elliptically at best – at least the form of artfully designed , lavishly embellished and meticulously printed maps that enjoyed such phenomenal popularity in the Netherlands from the late sixteenth through at least the early eighteenth century . Maps do matter , and , as Alpers astutely points out , cartographic materials played a significant and instructive role in the visual , JJ and indeed the political culture of the early modern Dutch Republic . They were ubiquitous in more ways than CD : as décor in houses and paintings ; as devices of learning and JJ standing ; as NN of cultural and political messaging . In a vital sense , however , these roles remain conspicuously absent in her analysis , inadequately problematized and not at all ‘ deconstructed ’ – to invoke the language of the JJ critical cartography that was being developed precisely when Alpers was formulating her insights into Dutch visual culture . 2 Maps as productive sources ( as opposed to theorized ‘ impulses ’ ) are only lightly glossed in Alpers ’ essay , their most superficial features brought to bear on a , by contrast , highly sophisticated argument about forms of ‘ mapped ’ landscapes ( as she terms it ) , best exemplified by the JJ panoramic paintings of Philips Koninck . This inverted theoretical focus distorts our perspective of Dutch ( and other ) maps and relegates to the periphery an enormously dynamic visual source in the early modern Netherlands . It RB irons out – unnecessarily – the stimulating complexities of cartographic sources and the promising possibilities of Alpers ’ implied query : what do maps offer to scholars of Dutch visual culture ? Rather than a ‘ JJ working NN ’ , a Dutch map of this period was typically dense and jagged , presenting the viewer with multiple angles of interpretive entry , as the essays of this issue show for other NN and genres . Rather than offering a ‘ detached or perhaps RB … culturally unbiased view ’ – can such a source ever be possible ? – these profusely layered artefacts furnish critical insight into and material evidence of the visual culture that Alpers aims to address . 3 Early modern maps are delightfully thick objects and fundamentally material things . They illustrate modes of representation and craft , and they encourage various points of vision and interpretation . As it turns out , maps are anything but ‘ JJ ’ . They richly demonstrate , in their own NN , the ‘ picturing impulse ’ of early modern Dutch culture . This brief intervention aims not so much to argue with Alpers as to consider a part of her argument that was left relatively under‐scrutinized : the workings of Dutch maps . My goal is less to analyse how these maps work – there is a vast and expanding literature that does just that4 – or RB how they work in the context of early modern Dutch painting , but rather to explore the qualities of cartographic design that might speak to the thematics of seeing and sensing pictures , so that they might contribute , in this NN , to the broader understanding of Dutch visual culture that this issue sets out to explore . Maps are indubitably thick : they gesture relentlessly toward their materiality and to the challenge their makers face in rendering into CD dimensions what begins as three – the same challenge confronted by Dutch painters , as several of the essays gathered here so elegantly argue . Maps are theatrical : they stage JJ NN in a profusely embellished form – they rarely offer mere , austere ‘ description ’ – and they dramatize for their viewers ways of processing both the lands and waters of the NN and the things and events that occur within them . And – as this might imply – maps are narrational : they narrate spaces , frame histories and posit polemics – much IN Baroque theatre , to be sure , yet RB IN genres of painting of the period , both in the Netherlands and elsewhere . To demonstrate a few of these qualities , I turn , naturally , to a map : Nicolaes Visscher 's immensely popular Novissima et Accuratissima Totius Americae Descriptio ( JJ edition c . 1658 ; plate 1 ) , published more or less contemporaneously with Vermeer 's Allegory of Painting ( c . 1666–68 ) . Visscher 's printed map has an impressive history , VBG backward and forward , and touching as well the key cartographic source of Alpers ’ inquiry . 5 Its original author was the only son of Claes Jansz . Visscher , the well ‐regarded cartographer who engraved the wall map depicted in the Vermeer Allegory . The Visscher family RB had ties by marriage to the illustrious Hondius firm , makers of the Mercator atlases through the JJ half of the seventeenth century – they were thus kinsmen of mapping aristocracy – and their atelier in Amsterdam on the Kalverstraat placed them in the thick of all things cartographic . The younger Visscher followed in his father 's professional footsteps and enjoyed considerable success , especially with his map of the Americas . The Americae went through several editions , RB in revised forms engraved by other ( sometimes competing ) ateliers ; it was appropriated for geography books , both as an insert and ( in a distilled form ) as a frontispiece ; and it was routinely copied and pirated outright , extending its successful run well into the eighteenth century . 6 It became perhaps the single most important early modern map of the western hemisphere and certainly CD of the most recognized images of the NNP NNP . Its allegorical ( lower ) cartouche , moreover , became the all ‐but standard representation of ‘ America ’ , an iconic image that crossed easily into other genres and NN . Nevertheless , despite its prestigious lineage and its titular promises of ‘ novelty ’ and ‘ accuracy ’ , the map succeeded not so much for its exacting ‘ description ’ as for other , arguably pictorial reasons : for its highly embellished and appealing presentation of the NNP NNP . The actual cartographic content of the map – the particular delineations of the lands and seas of the western hemisphere – was scarcely JJ . It derived mostly from older materials , chiefly Joan Blaeu 's 1648 map of the NN ; the outlines of the continents of these CD maps are nearly identical . This habit of replication was not at all uncommon in early modern Dutch cartography ( as in other graphic arts ) , especially in the sort of lavishly ornamented charts that became the mainstay of Amsterdam ateliers . Nor can the Visscher map make great claims for geographic meticulousness : a prominent ‘ California ’ floats off the western coast of America , an island of the mapmakers ’ imagination ; the Great Lakes blend into CD truly great lake , which leaks its contents into the Atlantic ; and the JJ ‐sought Northwest Passage is offered optimistically as readily accessible , an open NN flowing freely into Asia . The map 's promise of novelty and accuracy , in other words , is rhetoric – again , a fairly common ploy in early modern mapping ( as in late modern advertising ) . No Baconian empiricism here , but rather strategies that relate to the techniques of rhetoric – pervasive across myriad Renaissance fields of enquiry – and to the crafty practices of the workshop . What likely sold the map , more than its less ‐than ‐meticulous ‘ description ’ of the continents , MD have been the staging of the Americae and the ample ‘ adornments ’ that enriched Visscher 's product : the four‐legged staffage that wander the open , ultimately uncharted spaces of the map ( what J. B. Harley famously called its ‘ silences ’ ) ; the ethnographic vignettes that explicate the NNP NNP 's indigenes ; and , not least , the superb cartouches that fill the upper and lower divisions of the vast Pacific NNP , at once distilling and framing the continents in terms of NN and narrative . 7 The charming ‘ creatures in the map ’ – these did not VB out of style in the Renaissance – MD have appealed to a range of consumers . 8 CD handsome stag deer saunter across the terrain of Eastern Canada ( Nova Francia on the map ) ; they MD appear to await the hunter 's arrow just as do the tame deer of Ben Johnson 's poetic Penshurst or any other exemplary country house . A fox gambols across the Great Plains ( a scene likewise redolent of the Northern European countryside ) ; and beavers , coveted lately by Dutch merchants for their valuable pelts , pose obediently just inland of the plainly demarcated empire of Nieu [ NNP ] Nederland .9 Further afield a pair of brown bears inhabit the open , wild west ; meanwhile , a lone anteater has South America largely to himself . The two‐legged staffage of tropical America – that is , the indigenous Americans – do no hunt any exotic fauna , but CD another . Their depiction in the interior of Brazil , naked and engrossed in brutal warfare , offers a synoptic view of the ‘ savage ’ Indian , here imagined as uncivilized if RB unobtrusive . As for the pair of cartouches , CD occupying the upper left and the other the lower left portion of Visscher 's print , these serve as the dual anchors of the map , the dominant pictorial elements and the keys to the artefact 's interpretation ( plate 2 and plate 3 ) . They RB function to stage the map 's motifs and – crucially – to elucidate its overall message . It is here that both the theatrical and narrative impulses of Dutch mapping come through most vividly and most pictorially . Both cartouches follow designs by Nicolaes Pietersz . Berchem , a highly regarded landscape painter , as it turns out ( and the only son of Pieter Claesz , a master of still ‐life painting ) , who specialized in a form of idealized Italianate scenes popular in that period ( a subgenre of Dutch landscape that lay conspicuously beyond Alpers ’ scrutiny as putatively un ‐Dutch ) . 10 The pair of map vignettes work as an ensemble – the device of the parasol lures the viewer 's eye from the vignette below to the balancing scene above – yet it is the iconic figure of America herself , who gracefully gestures to the map 's ‘ carved ’ title , that lies at the heart of the visual programme . Berchem at once allegorized and condensed the essential qualities of the cartographic NN . He packed it all in : the alluring personification of ‘ America ’ , decked out in a dainty feathered skirt and colourful feathered headdress ; the pearls , barely visible around her neck , demonstrating the region 's endemic richness ; the classic bow and arrow , just to her NN , alluding to her habit of hunting ( America RB bears a stylized club ) ; the mounds of freshly mined gold ( or perhaps silver ) piling up at her NNS , alongside stacks of ingots that indicate the substantial mineral wealth of the continent ; a pair of queerly coiled snakes , which reveal the exotic naturalia of the NNP NNP ; and the central parasol , which shades America 's head from the tropical sun.11 The sum of the parts tells the NN of the whole : a massively rich , vaguely exotic , not ‐quite‐tamed NNP NNP . The upper cartouche furnishes another allegory , which introduces a different angle on America , yet CD that is thematically complementary . A cluster of figures surrounds and supports a free‐floating , shield ‐like device , which bears a patron 's coat of arms and the map 's dedication ( to Cornelius Witsen , a major supporter of overseas trade and exploration , on the original NN , yet this varies with different printings ) . 12 The predominant figure of this cluster , a European woman hovering in the very upper‐left corner of the map , represents Christian Faith : relatively plainly dressed , she points didactically with CD hand to a cross that she holds in her other hand and positions directly above the other figures . She glances not to the cross , however , but to a broad ‐shouldered , sharp‐taloned , demon ‐like figure below , who tumbles out of the sky : an allegory of diabolism , ejected by the Christian Church . An angel opposite and above gazes , mouth agape , at this falling devil and the wondrous turn of events , while another heavenly figure , just to the angel 's left , announces per clarion the plunge of diabolism and the spread of the gospel . Finally , an Indian – the figure situated closest to the American landmass who wears the same feathered headdress as the principal ‘ American ’ figure of the lower cartouche , in this NN linking the CD vignettes – gazes in astonishment at the allegory of Faith , whose good works have apparently converted him . The cartouche recounts , in short , the Church 's labours in the NNP NNP : its presumed successes casting out false faiths and diabolisms , and evangelizing among the American indigenes .13 To say that these vignettes are staged is to identify both the drama of Faith 's triumphs in the NNP NNP and the several marks of theatricality that hold the ensemble together . The parasol does this formally : not only does it lure the eye upward , but it points directly to the upper Indian ; were he to fall from the sky , he might pierce himself on the parasol 's tasselled spike . The parasol functions , further , as a clever stage prop , a showy accoutrement that establishes the ostentatious tropicality of America ( the point of the parasol abuts the very words ‘ Tropicus Capricorni ’ ) . In fact , bona fide parasols commonly served as props in Baroque theatre ; and a particularly famous example of this , the engraving of Anne Bracegirdle in her popular role as ‘ The Indian Queen ’ , alludes subtly to the Berchem allegory of America : feathers , pearls and parasol render the renowned Restoration actress adequately ‘ exotic ’ . 14 Theatrical motions – of hands and other limbs – RB lend the joint cartouches a dramatic , balletic cogency : arms akimbo on either side of the title slab , hands gesturing instructively by the allegorical figures both above and below , and the scissoring NNS of Christian Faith and her Indian protégé alike all serve to animate the scene . The swirling dress of Faith , swept up by the heavenly winds , and her billowing and entirely theatrical shawl ( since this prop MD have been utterly extraneous in the heavens ) suggest , yet again , tricks of the stage – and , of course , of highly painterly composition . All of these devices heighten the drama of the map and thereby elucidate the meaning of America . And all of these devices might RB prompt the question : what is the message of the map and the narrative arch that bridges Berchem 's upper and lower cartouches ? The bond between Faith and America harks RB to a proverbial wisdom that circulated in late medieval and early modern Europe about the inverse relation of ‘ NN ’ and ‘ gold ’ : wherever the latter flowed abundantly , it was proposed , the former was typically scarce ( and the reverse ) . Such a conception of America and her endemic riches ‐cum ‐heathenism justified much of Habsburg Spain 's early colonial action in the NNP NNP – the conquest and simultaneous conversion of the Indians . Yet it RB carried an implicit moral message , which gained traction among critics of the Habsburg Conquista , especially in Northern Europe . And here we need to turn to a text , CD of JJ that MD have helped viewers read Visscher 's map . A late sixteenth ‐century poem , which captioned the Dutch and German editions of an engraved allegory of America , commented poignantly on this contradictory relationship between the European NN and American gold ( words that punned RB more in the original : NN and goud in Dutch ) : Here the wondrous mineral wealth of America fosters her own decline ; she goes from benighted idolatry to miserable slavery . The sixteenth ‐century allegory ( engraved by Adriaen Collaert after a design by Maarten de Vos ) expresses sympathy for the doubly abused Indians . In the Visscher map , however , with its relatively neutral ‐looking figure of Faith , not obviously Catholic nor Protestant , and with its pan‐colonial vision of the Americas – NNP France , NNP Netherlands , and English ‐settled Virginia are all engraved into the NN , no less than the nomenclature of Iberian colonial possessions in South America – the message pertains to European colonialism and European exoticism writ JJ . The map spells out the evangelical and imperial rise of the Old NNP in the NNP . A map , however , RB while it MD possess plentiful text and RB while it might be read as and with the NN of text , is certainly not identical to text – it is textual and pictorial , not to mention cartographical . It is RB material , of course , and while there MD have been textual and iconographic foundations for such maps as Visscher 's , there were RB unmistakable evocations of craft and materiality . The heritage of early modern Dutch cartography goes RB not so much to Ptolemy , as Alpers argues , as to the pioneering labours of Gerard Mercator and Abraham Ortelius , who drew on the traditions of late ‐medieval mapping – highly pictorial and allegorical products , typically emanating from the workshops of master illuminators – and on the NN of craft . 16 Ortelius instinctively placed geography in the context of art : famously in relationship to history ( ‘ Historiae oculus geographia ’ ) , yet RB in the sphere of drama . 17 His Theatrum orbis terrarrum not only summons the language of the stage , but RB greets its audience on its engraved title page with a recognizable proscenium ( plate 4 ) . Mercator – whose posthumously published atlas RB adapted the symbols of theatre on its title page – sprang more directly from the milieu of craft . His main source of income in his early professional NNS came from the fabrication of mathematical and navigational instruments – this placed him in the vibrant , metal ‐working ateliers of northern Europe – and , for JJ of the early cartographic projects with which we associate him ( his work with Gemma Frisius and Gaspar à Myrica , for example , on their terrestrial globe ) , he served as a highly skilled engraver of brass plates . He was RB an innovator in the production of commercial globes ; and he was a remarkable italicist , who composed , designed and printed the JJ instruction book of italic script published north of the Alps . He mastered math and craft , art and ‘ NN ’ . More to the point , the actual , tangible maps of Mercator and Ortelius VBP out of their NN in these early NNS to emphasize their affiliation with modes of craft and material arts . Both mapmakers ’ ateliers , in producing the JJ generation of ‘ craft maps ’ – this is the geographer John Pickles ’ term for the highly pictorial , thickly ornamented maps that developed in the late sixteenth ‐century Netherlands18 – make habitual reference to the process of their maps ’ production and to the material arts whence they came . Thus does Mercator 's Orbis Terrae Compendiosa Descriptio make literal reference to its maker 's background in brass ‐work by the depiction of an armillary sphere in the upper centre of the map 's design , while RB making more figurative allusions to metalwork in the strapwork surrounding the armillary ; in the elaborate fretwork bearing the JJ hemispheres ; and in the clever metallic tooling of the engraved frame that encases the NN map ( plate 5 ) . These devices serve to emphasize the ‘ thickness ’ of early modern cartography – its broader project of converting three ‐dimensional NN into CD – while RB invoking the material arts with which Mercator ( and JJ map illuminators before him ) sought to affiliate himself . Thus , too , does Ortelius offer CD of his most celebrated cartographic images – Abrahami Patriarchae Peregrinatio et Vita ( 1590 ) , which charts the NN and journeys of the Old Testament patriarch Abraham , the mapmaker 's namesake – as a trompe l'oeil that invokes the illustrious art of tapestry ( plate 6 ) . Meanwhile , several other graphic techniques make more subtle gestures to various other material arts : twenty ‐two circular medallion vignettes , so ‐called since they evoke the bronze medallions much in fashion at that NN , do the heavy ‐lifting narration of Abraham 's NN ; CD superb cartouches display the map 's textual apparatus and once again reference the art of strapwork ( the interior sample with garlands being a particularly fine example of the genre ) ; and CD decorative masks – ‘ hung ’ on a strapwork cartouche , which is ‘ fastened ’ to a cartographic tapestry – not only lend a sense of depth to this already densely materialized map , but RB allude to the NN of theatre . The map , in short , offers a tour de force of spatial manipulation – to VB along with its textual and pictorial narration . Some three ‐quarters of a century later , Nicolaes Visscher and Nicolaes Berchem likewise expended considerable effort in thickening their map . They collaboratively layered several illusions of NN in the Americae engraving . Careful hatching around the edges of the continents and scattered islands lends a sense of depth to the hemisphere , a quality further enhanced by the ‘ shadows ’ cast by the ships at NN and the animals on shore ( VB plate 1 ) . This imparts to what otherwise might be perceived as JJ geographic NN the property of density , and it grants the map 's viewers an optical sense of verticality , as if they were observing the continents from an elevated , almost atmospheric altitude . The swirling figures of the upper vignette induce a dizzying lateral movement yet further up ; we are now in the skies , if not quite the heavens , where shadow and wind still persist ( VB plate 3 ) . The curling ( upper ) cartouche , which carries the map 's dedication on the form of a wooden shield , RB plays with the materiality of that shield : a shield bears a shield , as it were . In the lower vignette , NN moves more horizontally . Here there is a quality of earthiness , as opposed to the lofty airiness above , and the conceit that the ground slopes downward along with the figures behind the ‘ slab ’ of cartouche who recede gently into the horizon ( and presumably further into the subterranean mines from where America 's gold and silver originate ) ( VB plate 2 ) . And if wind animates the upper scene , the sun plays that role below , casting shadows over the figure of America , thereby RB accentuating the tropical heat of the land . The parasol , that most tangible of accessories of the tropics and theatre alike , stylishly shields ‘ America ’ from the elements , and in this NN RB pulls the narrative spaces together . Craft maps , a genre developed outstandingly in the picture‐rich culture of the early modern Netherlands , drew from the arts of painting and engraving , and from the fields of geography and the material arts . Their form owed much to the practices of ateliers : to printerly habits of delineating and ‘ describing ’ , to be sure , yet RB to modes of narrating and embellishing NN , of crafting and thickening maps . Indeed , within the intricate matrix of early modern Dutch workshops , the makers of maps borrowed as well as loaned ; images from cartographic sources and geography books moved from printed NN ( textual as well as iconographic ) , yet RB to material arts . ‘ America ’ MD redeploy over the coming decades from maps to forms of tapestry , ceramic ( especially porcelain , once Europe mastered its own techniques of production ) , lacquer ‐ware , cut glass , and so on , as the image steadily gained in popularity . Visscher 's cartographic images , in other words , moved from the CD ‐dimensional NN of the map RB to the three ‐dimensional NN of the decorative arts from where Mercator and Ortelius had drawn their earlier inspiration . Both the lineage and the influence of ‘ craft ’ maps are rich in numerous ways . Early modern Dutch maps are anything but mere ‘ description ’ , and they most certainly illustrate , pace Alpers , abundant ‘ pictorial marks of [ JJ and political ] authority ’ . CD They illustrate and narrate and dramatize much more , and much that speaks rather productively to Alpers ’ and our concerns with Dutch visual culture . For maps such as those produced by Visscher and his contemporaries ask us – just as other prints and paintings do – to VB about NN and its representation . Dutch maps use graphic forms and pictorial devices to stage NN and to present the drama of NN from multiple angles and perspectives . Visscher 's map , complemented by Berchem 's vignettes , displays the drama of European expansion from up high and down low , from the fauna‐rich interiors of the American continents to the ship ‐peppered seas that surround them . It invokes the tricks of theatre – rhetoric and gesture , evocation and insinuation , props and propaganda – to narrate NN , in this case the spaces of European conquest , colonialism and empire . And it narrates that NN in assorted ways , just as history narrates and as other textual and pictorial genres narrate : to be the eye of history is not necessarily to be wholly mute ( or purely descriptive ) . It does all this , again as other visual sources do , as a means to entice its viewers . The Americae beckon in myriad ways : Berchem 's figure of ‘ America ’ seduces its viewer with her opulent pearls and exotic feathers , tactile prompts of supreme allure ; Visscher 's sheet map invokes multiple registers of materiality , encouraging an intense sense of touch , depth and NN ; and the Americae , of course , arouse wide ‐ranging colonial desires , which surely reached across to several early modern European aspirants of imperial worlds . Early modern Dutch maps , in these JJ ways , surely exhibit the shared impulses of painting and cartography , yet this does not so much demonstrate a flattened mapping impulse in Dutch art as it reveals the rich , thick , pictorial impulses in Dutch maps ."

There are so JJ interesting facts about this Pyramid that it baffles archaeologists , NNS , astronomers and tourists . Here are the facts : 01 . The pyramid is estimated to have around 2,300,000 stone blocks that weigh from 2 to 30 tons each and there are RB some blocks that weigh over 50 tons . 02 . The Pyramid of Menkaure , the Pyramid of Khafre and the Great Pyramid of Khufu are precisely aligned with the Constellation of Orion . 03 . The base of the pyramid covers 55,000 m2 ( 592,000 ft 2 ) with each side greater than 20,000 m2 ( 218,000 ft2 ) in area . 04 . The interior temperature is constant and equals the average temperature of the NN , 20 Degrees Celsius ( 68 Degrees Fahrenheit ) . 05 . The outer mantle was composed of 144,000 casing stones , all of them highly polished and JJ to an accuracy of 1/100th of an inch , about 100 inches thick and weighing approx . 15 tons each . 06 . The cornerstone foundations of the pyramid have ball and socket construction capable of dealing with heat expansion and earthquakes . 07 . The mortar used is of an unknown origin ( Yes , no explanation given ) . It has been analyzed and its chemical composition is VBN but it ca n’t be reproduced . It is stronger than the stone and still holding up today . 08 . It was originally covered with casing stones ( made of highly polished limestone ) . These casing stones reflected the sun ’s light and made the pyramid shine IN a jewel . They are no longer present being used by Arabs to build mosques after an earthquake in the 14th century loosened JJ of them . It has been calculated that the original pyramid with its casing stones MD act IN gigantic mirrors and reflect light so powerful that it MD be visible from the moon as a shining star on NN . Appropriately , the ancient Egyptians called the Great Pyramid “ Ikhet ” , meaning the “ Glorious Light ” . How these blocks were transported and assembled into the pyramid is still a mystery . – http://www.gizapyramid.com/general.htm 09 . Aligned True North : The Great Pyramid is the most accurately aligned structure in existence and faces true north with only 3/60th of a degree of error . The position of the North Pole moves over NN and the pyramid was exactly aligned at CD NN . 10 . Center of Land Mass : The Great Pyramid is located at the center of the land mass of the NN . The east / west parallel that crosses the most land and the north / south meridian that crosses the most land intersect in CD places on the NN , CD in the NN and the other at the Great Pyramid . 11 . The four faces of the pyramid are slightly concave , the only pyramid to have been built this NN . 12 . The centers of the four sides are indented with an extraordinary degree of precision forming the only 8 sided pyramid , this effect is not visible from the ground or from a distance but only from the air , and then only under the proper lighting conditions . This phenomenon is only detectable from the air at dawn and sunset on the spring and autumn equinoxes , when the sun casts shadows on the pyramid . 13 . The granite coffer in the “ King ’s Chamber ” is too big to fit through the passages and so it must have been put in place during construction . 14 . The coffer was made out of a block of solid granite . This MD have required bronze saws 8 - 9 ft. JJ set with teeth of sapphires . Hollowing out of the interior MD require tubular drills of the same material applied with a tremendous vertical force . 15 . Microscopic analysis of the coffer reveals that it was made with a fixed point drill that used hard jewel bits and a drilling force of 2 tons . Related : The Real Builders of the Pyramids 16 . The Great Pyramid had a swivel door entrance at CD NN . Swivel doors were VBN in only CD other pyramids : Khufu ’s father and grandfather , Sneferu and Huni , respectively . 17 . It is reported that when the pyramid was RB broken into that the swivel door , weighing some 20 tons , was so well balanced that it MD be opened by pushing out from the inside with only minimal force , but when closed , was so perfect a fit that it MD scarcely be detected and there was not enough crack or crevice around the edges to gain a grasp from the outside . 18 . With the mantle in place , the Great Pyramid MD be seen from the mountains in Israel and probably the moon as well . CD . The weight of the pyramid is estimated at 5,955,000 tons . Multiplied by 10^8 gives a reasonable estimate of the NN ’s mass . 20 . The Descending Passage pointed to the pole star Alpha Draconis , circa 2170 - 2144 BCE . This was the North Star at that point in NN . No other star has aligned with the passage since then . 21 . The southern shaft in the King ’s Chamber pointed to the star Al Nitak ( Zeta Orionis ) in the constellation Orion , circa 2450 BCE The Orion constellation was associated with the Egyptian NN Osiris . No other star aligned with this shaft during that NN in history . 22 . Sun ’s Radius : Twice the perimeter of the bottom of the granite coffer times 10^8 is the sun ’s mean radius . [ 270.45378502 Pyramid Inches* 10^8 = 427,316 miles ] 23 . The curvature designed into the faces of the pyramid exactly matches the radius of the NN . 24 . Khufu ’s pyramid , VBN as the great pyramid of Giza , is the oldest and largest , rising at 481 NNS ( 146 meters ) . Archaeologists say it was the tallest structure in the NN for about 3 , 800 NNS . 25 . The relationship between Pi ( p ) and Phi ( F ) is expressed in the fundamental proportions of the Great Pyramid .

A paradigm shift is a fundamental NN in approach or underlining assumptions . For example , when Pythagoras proposed that the NNP was round instead of JJ , the foundation of NN and NNS ’s understanding of the NN was completely changed . Similarly , when the Industrial Revolution took place there was a complete shift in manufacturing , lifestyle , and economics . A paradigm shift can literally shake a society to its core , taking it off its current path and putting it on a brand JJ NN . Though it might appear the opposite in the corporate controlled mainstream NN , it appears that the entire NN is in the very early stages of a paradigm shift . These shifts take place in JJ of the worlds most basic elements and redefine how NN functions . Here are 8 signs the NN is undergoing a paradigm shift : 1. The Power of the Internet and the Age of NN The Internet is arguably the greatest invention in the history of NN . Never in our VBN history has NN had access to such a broad range of diverse NN from all over the NN at the tips of his fingers . JJ forget that the Internet has only really been commercialized in the west since the early 1990 ’s and its spread across the NN has n’t RB come close to peaking yet . The Internet is undoubtedly giving rise to the Age of NN as NNS become more awake to what ’s really VBG on in the NN . A multitude of NN is now accessible if PRP knows where to look . NNS can now learn JJ skills or hear different versions of the NN in mere minutes . The Internet is not only giving rise to an open access of NN , but communication is almost instantaneous all over the NN . It is paramount that the Internet remain an open decentralized system in which everyone can freely add and operate if this paradigm shift is to continue . It feeds almost all other shifts . 2. The Ascent Of the Independent Non-Corporate Online NN Thanks solely to the Internet , the rise in independent journalism has taken off . Alternative NN has become an increasingly popular choice for those wishing to stay truly informed , especially younger generations . NNS are continually switching off cable NN ( cable TV all together ) , and instead resorting to online sources . While mainstream NN is still the number CD source of current NN events for the masses , the tide is slowly changing as NNS are awakening to the fact that corporate sponsored NN is mostly propaganda and half - truths . War is becoming much harder to justify as independent journalists have shined the light on what the powers that be never wanted anyone to VB . A prime example is the conflict in Syria in which the establishment , despite the lack of popular support , so desperately wanted to start a war that when the rebels they were funding used chemical weapons , it was then blamed on the Assad NN to protect their investment and design . Thanks to independent journalists , a war has so far been averted since it was revealed that the U.S. was in bed with the rebel groups and it was the rebels who used the chemical weapons . This JJ faction of journalism will give peace a legitimate chance as all dirty laundry is now being aired and corrupt alliances exposed . This in turn has allowed JJ NNS to deprogram from the countless NN they have taken in over the NNS and VB the NN through a clearer lens in which the NN is more evident . Though it will never be broadcast on mainstream NN , the real threat of a U.S. dollar collapse as the NN reserve currency is very real . The paradigm of central bank controlled economies that can issue credit and zero percent interest rates through nearly unlimited printing of money backed by nothing is an illusion that is beginning to break down . It ’s not just the U.S. dollar that ’s under threat , but JJ other central currencies such as the Euro and Yen . Massive equity bubbles are being blown up by this cheap credit along with massive debt that will be nearly impossible to pay RB with the current economies in which only the very elite benefit . JJ NNS are waking up to the fact that , IN all other bubbles , these bubbles will burst and they are beginning to break away from the dollar . Examples include the buildup of a JJ central bank in the emerging economy of the BRICS group , the countless NNS passing trade agreements in which bypassing the U.S. dollar ( including agreements in oil ) , and the persistent selling of treasury stocks by the Chinese NN who quite often are the last resort buyer of U.S. debt . Not only has there been a shift in the pecking order of fiat paper currencies , but decentralized crypto-currencies IN Bitcoin are threatening the very system of fiat money and the centralized NN a select few elite have on that system through central banks . This MD shift power worldwide . 4. The Rise of the Peer - to - Peer Economy A Peer - to - Peer ( P20 ) Economy is a de-centralized model whereby CD individuals interact to buy or sell goods and services directly with each other , without intermediation by a third - party , or without the use of a NN or business . We VBP this being used by NNS IN Air BnB , Uber , Craigslist , Sidecar , and Dogvacay among others . Often referred to as a sharing economy , there is no centralized NN of power , allowing NNS to more directly profit from their goods / services rather than pay unnecessary middlemen along the NN . This is a trend that is sure to grow as technology makes it easier for NNS to make it on their own and allows for NNS to own their means of production and finished goods , instead of just being paid in the production process . The peer - to - peer economy is RB possible through the abundance of goods already out there , allowing for goods to be shared and recycled rather than thrown away and reproduced . Not only is the peer - to - peer economy growing , but JJ young NNS are ditching the career 9 - 5 jobs and branching off into independent careers or job hopping . The top down business model in economics has now VBN a legitimate system in which a decentralized bottom up approach gives the power RB to the NNS . The shift towards renewable NN is a forgone conclusion as renewable NN is the NN of the future . In fact , the shift looks to be happening faster than NNS realize . According to the NNP NNP Initiative , “ Numerous scenarios projected levels of renewable NN for 2020 that already were surpassed by 2010 . ” The IEA VBZ that , “ In 2012 , the NN relied on renewable sources for around 13.2 % of its total primary NN supply , and in 2013 renewables accounted for almost 22 % of JJ electricity generation . ” With increased technological capabilities along with ever - growing concern over the NN of the environment , the NN is beginning to not only shift towards renewables , but the power over NN supplies and grids is decentralizing . For example , home solar panels or the JJ Tesla Powerwall , MD enable NNS to access their own NN directly from the sun without VBG through middlemen . Another example is a local city IN Burlington , VT being the JJ city in the U.S. to use 100 % renewable NN ; RB whole NNS IN Paraguay , Iceland and Norway being 100 % renewable . Cheap localized NN is on the horizon along with the very real possibility Nikola Teslaonce envisioned , which is a NN of free NN . The reemergence of organic food is not only on the rise , but the use of farmers markets and locally grown food is on the rise as well . According to the Non GMO project , “ In more than 60 NNS around the NN , including Australia , Japan , and all of the NNS in the European Union , there are significant restrictions or outright bans on the production and sale of GMOs . ” The rise is so strong that according to the Organic Trade Association , “ Supply shortages [ of organics ] are CD of the greatest challenges facing the industry today . Despite continued growth in production , handlers are not able to keep up with demand . ” Thanks in JJ part to the Internet and non-corporate sponsored NN , NNS are beginning to understand the importance behind knowing exactly what ’s in the food CD consumes and how it directly correlates to NN . This has put mounting pressure on food businesses to adapt . The signs are already evident as Chipotle sees their profits increase while operating completely Non-GMO , while sales giants such as McDonalds VBP profits continue to decrease amidst NN concerns over their food . JJ are beginning to truly care what goes into their NN and the rise of localized non-organic food in this country is a direct result of this NN - conscious shift . 7. The Understanding Of a NN of Abundance As Gandhi famously VBD , “ The NN has enough for every NN ’s needs , but not for every NN ’s greed . ” NNS are finally awaking to the fact that there is enough to VB around , just not with the current systems in place . No NN is saying there is enough for everyone to live at current western consumption rates , however with adoption of renewable NN , JJ forms of decentralized NN and economics , and the increase in the usage of technological capabilities , there is more than enough for everyone in the NN to live happily . For example , the NN produces enough food for 10 billion NNS , yet JJ VBP starving as a result of faulty systems of distribution . Another example is NN ; there is more than enough NN on the planet , but it ’s the JJ systems that VBP in the NN of technology . The notion of scarcity has RB haunted the systems of NN and economics , but now a JJ paradigm of abundance is beginning to take root in the minds of NNS . The Venus project is a prime example of an alternative resource based economy in which sustainability and resource supply are taken into account . A NN of abundance with zero emission is no longer just a pipe dream , but MD very well become a reality as NNS VBP in terms of abundance . Finally a consciousness shift is underway in which NNS are starting to VB themselves as more than just individual NNS operating in an isolated bubble , but instead as a connected piece in the collective consciousness of planet NNP . The Internet , along with the increased capacity for travel , has allowed NNS from all over the NN to connect . So JJ parts of the JJ society have become interconnected and NNS are beginning to take notice of not only their own country , but NNS abroad . JJ are beginning to realize that CD group of NNS suffering means everyone is suffering . This interconnection to everything has given rise to practices such as meditation , yoga , and travel , as well as the continued JJ acceptance towards mind altering organic substances IN marijuana and mushrooms . NNS are beginning to emotionally connect to NN all over the NN and not just their immediate home and surroundings . This JJ reality is showing NNS that there is more to NN than money , as connection to all living things is equally , if not more , valuable . As PRP can VB , the NN is very much in the early stages of a shift in consciousness and design . These shifts are leading to a growing decentralization movement in which the power controls of society are taken from the few and given to the JJ . Obviously , there is a very strong force at play that is fighting against this paradigm shift . This force is fighting for centralization of power in almost all facets of NN . There can be no doubt of the presence of this resistance when PRP examines the ever - increasing wealth and power gap that is out of NN in this country . The actions taken by these elite organizations are getting more radical and desperate by the day . With all that being VBN , the JJ paradigm shift has CD advantage that I VBP will be the game changer , and that ’s the will of the NNS . This is not just the NNS of a a single country , but internationally , as VBN JJ movements such as Occupy Wall street , the Arab Spring , and March Against Monsanto are happening simultaneously all over the NN around central causes . So wake - up and participate , for we are in the early stages of a revolutionary paradigm shift in the consciousness of the masses that can truly VB society for the better . An avid free - thinker , Tim has set out on a mission in search of the NN in whatever form it MD come . Ever since his awakening several NNS ago , his passion for knowledge and justice has led him on a journey into deep NN , cultural travel , and complete expansion of the mind . Tim feels as if the NN freely flowing into the hands of the public , due to the dawn of the Internet , cannot be stopped at this point , so he has made it his goal to VB facilitate and breakdown this complex stream of NN , so that others can accelerate their own awakening and be part of the inevitable NN happening in society .

If ye be reproached for the name of Christ , happy are ye ; for the spirit of glory and of NNP resteth upon you : on their part he is evil spoken of , but on your part he is glorified . But let none of you suffer as a murderer , or as a thief , or as an evildoer , or as a busybody in other men 's matters . Yet if any NN suffer as a Christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glorify NNP on this behalf . For the NN is come that judgment must begin at the house of NNP : and if it RB begin at us , what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of NNP ? More and more , as I grow older , I am rejoicing and thanking and praising NNP for His blessings in my NN . Most of all , I thank NNP for the gift of His dear Son , Jesus Christ . John 3:16 , “ For NNP so loved the NN , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting NN . ” During my 52 NNS of NN , I have been through much suffering , NN of soul , frustration , loneliness , NN afflictions , loss and betrayal ; yet I am so happy to be a NN of NNP . I thank NNP for the roof over my head , RB though it is not mine . I thank NNP for the vehicle that I drive , RB though it is worn and has a tire VBG JJ that I need to VB fixed . I thank NNP for my NN , RB though I have incurable stenosis and radiculopathy from a neck injury which afflicts me horribly with chronic NN 24 / 7 . I thank NNP for my eyes , RB though I am near - sighted and cannot VB well at a distance . I do not VB being divorced and alone , but I thank NNP that I was n't the NN who filed for divorce , and I thank NNP for my family . I thank NNP for my imperfect parents , imperfect pastor , imperfect childhood , imperfect NN , imperfect free country that I am blessed to live in . Thank you Lord for all your blessings on me ! I rejoice in knowing that my name is written in Heaven , in the Lamb 's Book of NNP . I thank NNP that He forgave me for all my sins at age 13 , when I was born - again , which gives me the example , power and motivation to forgive others who have hurt me . I have forgiven everyone in my NN . Ephesians 4:31 - 32 , “ Let all bitterness , and wrath , and anger , and clamour , and evil speaking , be put away from you , with all malice : And be ye kind CD to another , tenderhearted , forgiving CD another , RB as NNP for Christ 's sake hath forgiven you . ” It does n't matter if others hate me , hurt me , or mistreat me , they are accountable to NNP for their actions , not me . I choose to love everyone with NNP 's unconditional love . I receive a lot of e-mails from NNS struggling with sin , suffering from depression , angry at NNP , confused and hurting in their NN and soul . I love helping all of them . For those of you who VBP me better than others , I love writing lengthy e-mails , pouring out my heart to VB NNS . I am sure I RB annoy some of my web visitors , writing a book RB to them . Please pardon me ! A lot of that stems from my loneliness as a single NN . I love when NNS ask me questions , and I have an answer in the Lord to VB them for Christ . It is my privilege . I pray for all my web visitors regularly and do love everyone with all my heart . I wish I MD only do so much more to VB NNS . I do what I can for NNP , giving Him all the credit , praise and glory . If there is anything good in me , it is the precious Lord Jesus Christ ! Psalms 147:7 , “ Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving ; unto our NNP . ” I bought a nice 21 string harp last NN , but have n't spent much NN with it . I have always loved playing stringed instruments . Lately ( in recent months ) I have kept busy working on my website ministry , and I 've been emotionally down about NN in general , so I have n't felt much IN playing my music . I VBP through seasons of depression , and have learned that this is normal for me as a Christian . The Bible tells us how to handle depression in James 5:13 , “ Is any among you afflicted ? let him pray . Is any merry ? let him sing psalms . ” When I am sad and down about NN , I bunker into the Word of NNP , work hard on my ministry , focus on soulwinning , and pray my NN through the storm , trusting my beautiful all - knowing , all - powerful and all - loving NNP to VB me through , NN after NN . Lamentations 3:26 , “ It is good that a NN should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD . ” Is n't that a precious Bible verse ! Lamentations 3:26 , “ It is good that a NN should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD . ” There is nothing JJ under the sun . Just as today , it is JJ nature to be selfish . NNP had wonderfully blessed the Hebrews , but they took it all for granted and did n't appreciate what NNP had done for them . Moses warned the NNS to beware of forgetting about NNP in lieu of all His tremendous blessings upon them . NNP had miraculously parted the Red NNP RB in front of them , so that they RB walked across on dry ground ! Yet the JJ thing they did when they got to the other side is COMPLAIN that they had no NN . This is unbelievable , read it for yourself ... Exodus 15:19 and 22 and 24 , “ For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the NN , and the LORD brought again the waters of the NN upon them ; but the NNS of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the NN . ... So Moses brought Israel from the Red NNP , and they went out into the wilderness of Shur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and VBD no NN . ... And the NNS murmured against Moses , saying , What shall we drink ? ” I VBP disgusted just from reading that . Those Hebrew ingrates — who had just witnessed NNP deliver them from Pharaoh 's army , walking across the Red NNP floor on dry ground , then watching Pharaoh 's army ( men and horses alike ) all drown when the waters returned upon them — started complaining just three days later in the Wilderness that they had no NN , failing to have faith in the power and love of their great omnipotent NNP . It is incredibly amazing to me . Moreover , the Jews were warned again and again by Moses the prophet , to stop their complaining , lest it destroy them , but they did n't listen . After complaining for the TENTH NN , NNP had finally had enough and banned them from ever entering into the Promised Land . NNP hates the sin of complaining ! HE HATES IT !!! Pastor Jack Hyles preaches a powerful sermon on this very topic about complaining in a sermon titled : “ THE HOTTEST HELL OF ALL ! ” NNS ( whether it be fellow Christians , preachers , family , acquaintances or strangers ) are always VBG to hurt our feelings . They will be inconsiderate , disappoint , let us down , gossip about us , judge us and make us sad if I focus on NNS — so I live above the clouds where Jesus lives ! America has forgotten the NNP of the Bible . Deuteronomy 6:12 , “ Then beware lest thou forget the LORD , which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage . ” So often in NN , NNS receive good at the hand of NNP , but return nothing in the NN of gratitude . In the Old Testament , we learn about a godly NN named Job , who made a remarkable statement to his wife when she suggested that he curse NNP and die . Job 2:10 , “ But he VBD unto her , Thou speakest as CD of the foolish women speaketh . What ? shall we receive good at the hand of NNP , and shall we not receive evil ? In all this did not Job sin with his lips . ” Oh that we MD all adopt the godly attitude of Job , who understood ( as our text passage from 1st Peter shows ) that NN includes good and bad . I choose to praise NNP for the good in my NN , and blame the Devil for the bad . It is not NNP 's fault that I have made some stupid and unwise decisions in my NN . Blessed be the name of the Lord , for He is faithful , fair and good to all ! Psalms 145:9 , “ The LORD is good to all : and his tender mercies are over all his works . ” The heathen NN is always placing NNP on trial , but we are the ones who refuse to obey His inspired Words in the Holy Bible . Job 9:3 , “ If he [ NN ] will contend with him [ NNP ] , he can not answer him CD of a thousand . ” No NN can ever blame NNP ( Romans 1:20 ) , for He is faithful . 2nd Timothy 2:13 , “ If we VBP not , yet he abideth faithful : he can not deny himself . ” As Ron Hamilton ( Patch The Pirate ) VBZ , every Christian should have : “ THE GRATITUDE ATTITUDE ! ” Kindly , we are getting what we deserve as a foolish nation for forsaking the NNP of the Holy Bible . What can we expect from NNS who have grown up void of the knowledge of NNP ? I read an article today about CD 10 NN old looking boys who are guilty of a carjacking . To add insult to injury , Freemasons ( who VBP the NNP NNPS ) have introduced the blatant lies of Evolution in all public schools to intentionally lead impressionable NNS away from NNP , misleading them to VB that they came from a Big Bang , stardust and from the same biological source as gorillas . What can we expect from such abused NNS ? How can we expect NNS deprived of a God-centered education to exemplify NNP - JJ behavior ? NNP is love ! To deliberately withhold a God-centered education from a NN , and substitute it with a fraudulent system of lies that reduce humanity to the level of animals , is a cruel form of NN abuse ! The whole scam of the rights of “ atheists ” not to have to hear the teachings of the Bible in public schools has destroyed the fiber of our society ! I do n't generally follow the NN because it is so depressing , but I have been doing a lot of NN for my ministry and reading through crime NN lately . I did n't realize how bad things have become in American society . This is the obvious horrifying consequence of removing and banning the inspired Word of NNP from NNS 's daily lives in public school classrooms since 1963 . The Holy Bible has Always Been The Answer ! You cannot deny that to the same degree that our country has abandoned the Word of NNP , to that same degree society is VBG to the Devil ! I have RB been watching the Forensic Files , using amazing NN to solve horrifying crimes . The evildoer culprits are sometimes police officers , fire investigates , pastors and churchgoers . It is unbelievable what JJ beings are capable of ! Truly the JJ race is depraved , just as the Holy Bible VBZ . Romans 3:10 - 11 , “ As it is written , There is none righteous , no , not CD : There is none that understandeth , there is none that seeketh after NNP . ” The city of Chicago is CD of the most dangerous places on NN to live . The following article is just from CD weekend ... 7 Killed , 46 Wounded In Weekend Shootings ; ‘ It ’s Destroying The Fiber Of Our Communities ’ CHICAGO ( CBS ) — Dozens of NNS were shot in Chicago over the weekend , including CD mass shootings in less than three hours on Sunday . In all , seven NNS were killed and 46 others were wounded in shootings since Friday evening . More than a dozen NNS were wounded , CD of them fatally , in a pair of mass shootings in the Lawndale neighborhood early Sunday . The JJ shooting happened around 1:20 a.m. near Roosevelt and Francisco in Douglas Park . Police VBD a group of NNS was standing in the park , when someone opened fire from a black Chevrolet Camaro . Seven NNS were wounded : • A 21 - NN - old NN shot in the groin was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in critical condition ; • A 25 - NN - old woman shot in the arm and leg was taken to Mount Sinai , where she was stabilized ; • A 20 - NN - old NN shot in the JJ side was taken to Stroger Hospital , where he was stabilized ; • A CD - NN - old woman shot in the JJ leg was taken to Stroger , where she was stabilized ; • A 22 - NN - old woman was taken to Mount Sinai , where she was stabilized ; • A 21 - NN - old NN shot in the left leg was taken to Mount Sinai , where he was stabilized ; • A 23 - NN - old NN shot in the chest and hand took himself to Mount Sinai , where he was stabilized . Less than three hours later , eight NNS were shot in Lawndale , near 18th and Kildare around 3:45 a.m. , when unknown s hooters opened fire on a JJ group of NNS at a block party . CD NN , 33 - NN - old Demetrius Flowers , was killed , and seven other NNS were wounded : • A 35 - NN - old NN shot in the forehead was taken to Mount Sinai , where he was stabilized ; • A 28 - NN - old NN shot in the hip was taken to Mount Sinai , where he was stabilized ; • A 27 - NN - old NN shot in the NN was taken to Mount Sinai , where he was stabilized ; • A 28 - NN - old NN shot in the leg Mount Sinai , where he was treated and released ; • A 14 - NN - old boy was shot in the thigh , and was taken to Stroger , where he was stabilized ; • A 21 - NN - old woman suffered a graze wound to the thumb , and was treated and released at St. Margaret Hospital ; • A CD - NN - old woman was shot in the head , and was taken to Stroger , where she was treated and released . Flowers ’ father , VBD it ’s the second son he ’s lost to violence . “ Please stop . It ’s killing our families , it ’s destroying the fiber of our communities . We have to stop this senseless killing , because if we do n’t , there ’s nothing VBG to be left . There ’s nothing VBG to be left , ” Keith Flowers VBD . CD young NN unfortunately murdered over the weekend in Chicago , was 33 NN old Demetrius Flowers . His father , Keith Flowers , made the following public statement : I am not trying to be unkind , NNP knows my heart , but this father is preaching to the choir . Gang thugs do n't care ! Keith is making his statement to law - abiding citizens . I noticed in the preceding NN NN that 90 % of the NNS shot were very young , close to 20 NNS old . That speaks volumes ! Our youth are infested with evil today , because they have been deprived of NNP 's Word in ungodly schools . Luciferians are behind the destruction of America ! All high - level Freemasons worship Lucifer , the 99 % lower initiates are woefully naive . The same is true of the CIA , U.S. NN , Mormonism and other subversive and subverted groups . I am very sorry for Mr. Flowers ' loss in the death of his son , and I am not belittling him in any NN , NNP forbid . I am simply pointing out that it is not VBG to VB anything to make statements about how NNS need to stop shooting each other . NNS need the Word of NNP ! If you do n't allow thoughts of greed to dwell in your mind , then those thoughts cannot fester . No NN suddenly goes out and purchases a NN insurance policy on their spouse , and then plots to murder them in a clever NN to make it look IN an accident . RB before such wickedness came into that person 's mind , there was already a heart of greed and ungodliness . The major underlying personal theme that I take away from the whole Forensic Files series is the following passage of Scripture from the Holy Bible ... That is the great NN that needs to be engrained into the minds of NNS , every single day of their school NNS . If I had my NN , every NN MD recite this passage of Scripture along with their teacher every day , at the beginning of each class , so that it MD be so engrained in their soul , that it MD be a permanent part of their soul for the rest of their NN . NNS today do n't love NNP . Their parents who grew up in America 's Godless public school system , do n't love NNP . Their grandparents , who grew up in America 's ungodly school system after 1963 , do n't love NNP . Anyone in the NNP NNPS today under the age of 74 , did n't hear the inspired Word of NNP read in a public school . That is why crime is epidemic today across the NNP NNPS , and it can be truthfully VBN of our culture : I am VBG to preach the NN until I can no longer do so — THE KING JAMES BIBLE IS THE ANSWER !!!!!!! Everyone who is guilty of hurting another JJ being , to provide the heinous crime to make another episode of Forensic Files , failed to heed the Bible 's command to LOVE NNP and LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR ! The CD greatest commandments in the Word of NNP are to LOVE NNP , and LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOUR . Do n't ever forget that NN and you wo n't VB astray ! As Brother Lester Roloff ( 1914 - 1982 ) VBD — these CD commandments are really just CD — TO LOVE ! If we fall in love with our Maker , and allow NNP to love us , and allow NNP to love our fellow NN through us , then we will never intentionally harm another JJ being . Amen ! I sure hope somebody is listening . Every Christian believer needs to be on - guard against sin continually , because anyone is capable of committing the worst sins under the JJ circumstances . That is what I mean by my article title : “ Love , Forgive , NN , Work And Pray . ” No NN is above sin ! NO CD ! The Bible admonishes us to take heed if we are misled to VB we are doing okay , because we MD commit an unthinkable crime just IN the criminals we read about . Every criminal at CD NN was a law - abiding citizen ! Proverbs 4:23 , “ Keep thy heart with all diligence ; for out of it are the issues of NN . ” That Bible verse means to deal with the small sinful thoughts in your mind , before they grow into evil behavior ! I VBP to VB RB , do RB , and live RB , to please NNP and stay out of trouble . I VBP to : “ Love , Forgive , VB , Work And Pray . ” If you maintain that godly attitude — of always loving others , and forgiving everyone , and helping everyone , and working honestly to stay busy , and praying for NNP 's power and protection from evil — you will joyously prosper in the Christian NN . There is no joy IN knowing you are JJ with NNP and NN . I VBP to live in such a NN that no NN can justly accuse me of doing evil . ... Quite often , I have web visitors confide in me that they are struggling with the sins of lust , hatred , pornography , pride , rebellion , et cetera . I always try to VB them in a spirit of meekness . Galatians 6:1 , “ Brethren , if a NN be overtaken in a fault , ye which are spiritual , restore such an NN in the spirit of meekness ; considering thyself , lest thou RB be tempted . ” The Bible teaches us in 2nd Corinthians 10:5 , “ Casting down imaginations , and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of NNP , and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ . ” Here we learn how to live RB ! When a sinful thought enters into our mind , we are supposed to CAST DOWN THAT THOUGHT with the inspired Word of NNP ( i.e. , the King James Bible ) . By doing that , you prevent the Devil from filling your heart to do evil . I refuse to have a garbage pail for a mind . Anyone can choose to live RB ! In the Old Testament , Job was a godly NN who purposed in his heart to VB and live RB . Job 31:1 , “ I made a covenant with mine eyes ; why then should I VB upon a maid ? ” I receive e-mails from young men who are struggling with lust and pornography . That is a very dangerous vice ! The NN to handle it is to take NN of your thought - NN and abstain from fleshly lusts . 1st Peter 2:11 , “ Dearly beloved , I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims , abstain from fleshly lusts , which war against the soul . ” The Bible commands men to abstain from the lusts of the flesh . To look at filthy images is a CHOICE ! Until you start making the JJ choices , you 'll never gain victory over any sin . Each NN you make the wrong sinful choice , it makes it a little easier to make another sinful choice , until you turn evil , and eventually you 'll be the next episode of Forensic Files ! Behind every tragedy in JJ character is a slow process of wicked thinking ! Christians Are Pilgrims Not Settlers On NNP It is important for every believer to embrace the mindset that this temporary NN is not our home . Do n't VB too comfortable down here . Brother Lester Roloff ( 1914 - 1982 ) preached a wonderful sermon titled : “ Do n't VB Adjusted , ” in which sermon he makes the truthful statement : “ YOU LOSE OUT WHEN YOU VBP ADJUSTED DOWN HERE ! ” I hate this wicked NN ! I am so sick and tired of the sin , the filth , and the ungodly transgendered homosexual agenda that is as a NN upon society today , sick of it all !!! RB so , come , Lord Jesus !!! Heaven is our home where we will ultimately settle ( John 14:1 - 3 ) . The heathen NN places all emphasis on this earthly NN , living for the moment with no thought of facing the Eternal NNP someday . As believers , we are commanded to — “ Set your affection on things above , not on things on the NN . For ye are dead , and your NN is hid with Christ in NNP ” ( Colossians 3:2-3 ) . Oh , how Christians fail to follow the Lord 's instruction in the Scriptures ! When believers fret and worry and complain and focus on making money , “ they are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this NN , and bring no fruit to perfection ” ( Luke 8:14 ) . Carnal believers are n't soulwinners ! All we hear about nowadays is that everyone should accept and respect the rights of homosexuals . The heart of the matter is NNP . What does NNP VB ? What does NNP say in His Holy Word ? You 've got the righteous speaking out against the evils of homosexuality , as the Bible tells us to do . Ephesians 5:10 - 12 , “ Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord . And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather reprove them . For it is a shame RB to speak of those things which are done of them in secret . ” A NN sodomizing another NN 's anus is a work of darkness ! I am grossed out and sickened when I hear pastors of churches legitimizing the LGBTQ community , such as did Southern Baptist Convention NN J.D. Greear . Proverbs 29:27 , “ An unjust NN is an abomination to the just : and he that is upright in the NN is abomination to the wicked . ” Kindly , I heard Tim Cook , the present CEO of Apple computer say publicly : “ Being gay is NNP 's greatest gift to me . ” NNP calls Tim Cook a liar ! Proverbs 28:9 , “ He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law , RB his prayer shall be abomination . ” Leviticus 20:13 , “ If a NN RB lie with mankind , as he lieth with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination : they shall surely be put to death ; their NN shall be upon them . ” We are living in extremely wicked times , in which ungodly reprobates are elevating their own ungodly JJ lusts over the inspired Words of NNP . That is so wrong ! Judges 21:25 , “ In those days there was no king in Israel : every NN did that which was JJ in his own eyes . ” The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that a JJ being in a mother 's womb is not yet a NN , so it can be killed . NNP calls it murder ( Exodus 20:13 ) . ABORTION : HANDS THAT SHED INNOCENT NN !!! It is hard to RB imagine how a society MD ever become so ungodly , uncaring , indifferent , calloused and far from NNP , that their leaders MD justify murdering JJ NN . And now in JJ NNS infanticide is legal , where a NN is murdered while being delivered , and in Illinois , after leaving the womb . Ungodly NN Of Illinois Declares Open Season On NNS : Removes All Bans On Abortions ! 2nd Timothy 3:12 , “ Yea , and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution . ” I am VBG to quote a rather lengthy passage from 1st Peter , to VB you VB the full context of what the apostle Peter is teaching us . The Bible teaches that when a Christian separates from their old NN of sin , and from their old worldly acquaintances , they will VB it strange , criticizing us and persecuting us in JJ NNS . ... The Bible admonishes Christians not to be surprised that worldly NNS hate us , persecute us and separate from us over our faith and stand for Christ . Jesus VBD in John 15:19 that if we were of the NN , they MD receive us ; but because we are not of the NN , we are followers of Christ our Savior , the NN hates us . John 7:7 VBZ they really hate Jesus , and that they VBP Christ in us . The NN hates Jesus Christ !!! In Everything Gives Thanks ! Jesus miraculously healed ten men afflicted with the horrible incurable NN of leprosy . Today there is a cure for leprosy , since the 1940's , but in Bible times there was n't and it was a much feared NN . Unbelievably , only CD NN had enough gratitude to come RB to thank the Lord . Luke 17:17 , “ And Jesus answering VBD , Were there not ten cleansed ? but where are the nine ? ” There are 86,400 seconds in each day , have you thanked NNP RB once today for His abundant blessings ? We ought to thank NNP continually for our food , comforts , family , salvation , the Holy Bible and manifold gifts that most NNS take for granted . James 1:17 , “ Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and cometh down from the Father of lights , with whom is no variableness , neither shadow of turning . ” Every good thing in your NN comes from NNP , whether you acknowledge that fact or not . And RB , within NNP 's permissive will , everything bad that happens in our lives is allowed by NNP , which is a difficult NN to embrace . We live in a fallen NN because of sin , beginning with Adam ( Romans 5:12 ) . When Adam chose to sin , he opened the floodgate of sin and death upon the NN . This is why bad things happen to good NNS , and good things happen to bad NNS , and NN is not fair ! Christians ought to be mindful of our blessings , especially in America where we have been blessed beyond all expectations compared to most of the impoverished NN . Just the privilege and opportunity to VB out to eat , in a fancy restaurants IN Chilies or Burger King ( that 's fine dining to me ) , is something that most NNS living in the NN cannot enjoy . We take so much for granted in America . We are so spoiled . It is a crying shame and the epitome of utter ingratitude — that amidst all these incredible blessings , liberty and modern comforts from NNP — that Americans are sinfully steeped into sexual immorality , 60 million NNS murdered by abortion , homosexuals marriages and all manner of filth , evil and wickedness !!! NNP deserves so much better , but Americans treat Him IN garbage ! We really do as a NN ! How do you VB NNP feels that we have allowed our NN to remove and ban the Holy Bible from NNS 's lives ? Honestly , so you have any idea how detrimental that has been to our nation ? The Bible is the Sacred Book , the only Book in existence that teaches mankind to LOVE , yet hateful and ungodly reprobates have used stupid excuses to rid NNS of the only chance they have of growing up to become a loving JJ being ! I suffer in constant chronic neck NN . My wife divorced me against my will in 2006 , and I have lived alone ever since in the Lord ( 1st Corinthians 7:27 ) . I have forgiven her completely , but as Dr. Jack Hyles wisely VBD : Divorce is a sin that perpetuates for a lifetime . I lost well over $ 100,000 as a result of the divorce . I lost my home after the divorce and have rented since . I lost my retirement . I lost my pets . I lost most of my possessions . I MD VB on and on for hours describing all the NN , loss , suffering and heartache in my NN over the past 20 NNS . Pastor John K. Jenkins Sr. exposes the evils of divorce in his excellent sermon titled : The Devastating Demon That Destroys Families . I am as much a sinner as my former wife , so I do not point fingers . There are no perfect marriages . NNP VBZ when you marry someone , you become CD with them , so as far as I 'm concerned her sins throughout our marriage were my sins too . WE HAVE SINNED ! Albeit , despite my misery , problems , NN and broken heart , I have the joy of the Lord in my soul . I have peace IN a river . Isaiah 26:3 , “ Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee : because he trusteth in thee . ” I love that Bible verse ! That is a solemn promise from our great NNP . The Lord promises perfect peace to the believer whose mind dwells and remains upon God. Psalms 1:1 - 2 , “ Blessed is the NN that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly , nor standeth in the NN of sinners , nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful . But his delight is in the law of the LORD ; and in his law doth he meditate day and night . ” The Bible VBZ the reason why we have perfect peace is because we trust the Lord . Perfect peace comes from trusting NNP in everything ! I choose to love , forgive , VB , work and pray in the Lord , instead of worry , complain , hate harbor bitterness and place NNP on trial . I am VBG to continue to trust the Lord , though He slay me . Job 13:15 , “ Though he slay me , yet will I trust in him : but I will maintain mine own ways before him . ” I am VBG to love everybody . I choose to forgive everyone RB before they ask . I am trying by NNP 's grace to VB as JJ NNS as I can . I labor night and day for the Lord . I pray because Jesus VBD without Him we can do nothing ( John 15:5 ) . I need NNP 's NN in everything I do . Galatians 2:20 , “ I am crucified with Christ : nevertheless I live ; yet not I , but Christ liveth in me : and the NN which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of NNP , who loved me , and gave himself for me . ” Everywhere I VBP today , I meet NNS who have contempt for Christians , churches and the Holy Bible , but they claim to love NNP . They are deceived . Nobody loves NNP who despises the King James Bible ! Although JJ churches are corrupt , THE CHURCH has never been ( nor ever MD be ) corrupted . Likewise , the INCORRUPTIBLE WORDS OF NNP cannot be corrupted ( 1st Peter 1:23 ) . The corrupted modern Bible versions are NOT NNP 's inspired Words . You can VB the NN of NNP into a lie all you VBP ( Romans 1:25 ) , but you cannot VB THE NN ! ... Listen to me dear reader , whatever your hang up MD be — whether it be struggling with sin , religious scrupulosity , finding NNP 's will , depression or confusion — VB into the Scriptures and you will grow ! 1st Timothy 4:13 - 15 , “ Till I come , give attendance to reading , to exhortation , to doctrine . Neglect not the gift that is in thee , which was given thee by prophecy , with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery . Meditate upon these things ; give thyself wholly to them ; that thy profiting MD appear to all . ” When somebody tells me that they are struggling with sin , I always point them toward the Holy Bible . Psalms 119:9 , “ Wherewithal shall a young NN cleanse his NN ? by taking heed thereto according to thy word . ” You cannot heed NNP 's Word if you are not familiar with the contents of NNP 's Word . SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES !!! It was 23rd U.S. NNP Benjamin Harris ( 1833 -1901 ) who wisely VBD : Dear friend , The Holy Bible Has Always Been The Answer . MD to NNP that we still had that kind of wisdom today in leadership . I have been watching the Forensic Files , and in nearly every case of a person being convicted of NNP Degree Murder , the NN refuses to use capital punishment . That is the sordid wisdom of this foolish and ungodly NN . I am 100 % for capital punishment , because that is NNP 's wisdom . Please read : “ THE CASE FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT : HOW IT SAVED MY NN ” ( a needful doctrinally sound book by Dr. Max D. Younce ) . The foolish NN never comes to their senses ! 2nd Timothy 3:7 , “ Ever learning , and never able to come to the knowledge of the NN . ” The newsmedia reports the problem . Career professionals VBP the problem . Talk shows exploit the problem . NN legislates the problem . Police VBP the problem . HUMANITY IS THE PROBLEM ! I thank NNP for His precious inspired Word in the King James Bible , which is our Lamp . Psalms : 119:105 , “ Thy word is a lamp unto my NNS , and a light unto my path . ” Humanity is the problem , because of our inherent sinful nature . The answer is the ' GOOD NN ' ( GOSPEL ) of the Lord Jesus Christ crucified on the cross for our sins , buried and bodily resurrected the third day for our justification ! John 6:47 , “ Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me hath everlasting NN . ” How Permanent Is Your Salvation ? Mark 1:15 : “... repent ye , and VB the gospel . ” “ The mark of the NN of NNP is that he loves everybody ! ” And Jesus answering saith unto them , Have faith in NNP . Ye Must Be Born Again ! | You Need HIS Righteousness !"

After weeks of generally optimistic statements , officials are now warning us to prepare for the worst . Over the past several days we have seen the number of confirmed NNS outside of China escalate dramatically , and this has really rattled JJ financial markets . After being down more than 1,000 points on Monday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell another 879 points on Tuesday . U.S. stocks have lost more then 1.7 trillion dollars in value in just CD days . Much more importantly , a wave of tremendous panic is starting to sweep across America , and it looks IN this crisis is just getting started . Usually officials at the CDC choose their words very carefully so that they do not needlessly alarm the public . With that in mind , I MD VB for you to consider three statements that the CDC’s Dr. Nancy Messonnier made about a potential outbreak inside the NNP NNPS during a press conference on Tuesday … # 1 “ It ’s not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country anymore but a question of when this will happen . ” # 2 “ Disruption to everyday NN MD be severe . ” # 3 “ We are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad . ” Can you ever recall a top CDC official ever making statements this ominous ? In addition , Messonnier warned that it MD soon become necessary for schools and businesses to greatly restrict person to person contact … The CDC outlined what schools and businesses will likely need to do if the NN - CD NN becomes an epidemic outbreak in the U.S. Schools should consider dividing students into smaller groups or close and use “ internet - based tele - schooling , ” Dr. Nancy Messonnier , director of the CDC ’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , VBD reporters on a conference call . “ For adults , businesses can replace in - person meetings with NN or telephone conferences and increase teleworking options , ” Messonnier VBD . On a temporary basis such measures MD not be too disruptive , but what if this NN just keeps spreading month after month ? We are potentially facing a scenario that is truly unprecedented , and it is becoming increasingly clear that officials have lost confidence that they will be able to contain this NN . In fact , CD former U.S. official VBD USA Today that “ the horse is out of the barn ” … Dennis Carroll , former director of the U.S. Agency for International Development ’s NNP NNP Security and Development Unit , credited China ’s “ extraordinary NN measures ” with delaying the spread of the NN . But he VBD avoiding a NN is “ very unlikely . ” “ The dramatic uptick of NNS in South Korea , Iran and Italy are reflective of a self - sustaining spreading of the NN , ” Carroll , who now leads the NNP Virome Project NN cooperative , VBD USA TODAY . “ And a clear message that the horse is out of the barn . ” At this point there are still only a few dozen confirmed NNS in the NNP NNPS , but authorities are bracing for the worst . If you can VB it , San Francisco Mayor London Breed just declared a NN of emergency because of this NN … Mayor London Breed declared a local emergency in San Francisco Tuesday amid the NN outbreak , despite there being no confirmed NNS among the city ’s residents . “ Although there are still zero confirmed NNS in San Francisco residents , the JJ picture is changing rapidly , and we need to step - up preparedness , ” Breed VBD in a statement . “ We VBP the NN spreading in JJ parts of the NN every day , and we are taking the necessary steps to protect San Franciscans from harm . ” And after being quite apathetic about this outbreak at RB , NNS all over America are suddenly realizing that they should be preparing for a potential NN . In fact , Silicon Valley investor Geoff Lewis created quite a stir when he asked for advice on stockpiling food . The following is the question that he posted on NNP that caused so much of an uproar … If CD were hypothetically stockpiling four months of shelf stable food , what MD folks recommend ( optimizing for keto friendly ) ? We have n’t seen anything IN this in the NNP NNPS in a very JJ NN . But we have n’t RB had a single death from this NN in our country yet . How crazed will NNS VB when victims start dropping dead in the streets IN they have been in Wuhan ? There is now talk that the IOC MD potentially cancel or postpone the Olympic Games in Tokyo . At CD NN such talk MD have seemed crazy , but this is how serious this outbreak has become . In Iran , the number of confirmed NNS has now jumped to 95 , although JJ NNS VBP that the true number is far , far higher . During a press conference on Monday , Iran ’s deputy NN minister attempted to downplay the seriousness of this outbreak , but on Tuesday we learned that he has been infected too … Iran ’s deputy NN minister VBD he has tested positive for the novel NN and is in self - quarantine at his home just a day after he appeared at a NN conference in Tehran where he sought to quell fears about the outbreak . Iraj Harirchi , the head of Iran ’s counter - NN task force , announced the illness in a NN online while vowing that authorities MD continue working to VB the spread . Apparently not wanting to be outdone , CD of the officials in South Korea that was overseeing the response to this outbreak decided to jump off a bridge … But in Seoul took on a more morbid tone Tuesday following reports in the local press that a civil servant from the Ministry of Justice ’s Emergency Safety Planning Office jumped off a bridge in Seoul at around 5 am local NN Tuesday . The official was CD of several individuals charged with overseeing the NN ’s response to the NN . As NNS soar and hysteria mounts , we suspect this NN wo n’t exactly VB quiet the public ’s nerves . Suicide is never the answer to anything , and we should all be praying for that NN ’s family . In Italy , the number of confirmed NNS has grown by more than 15 times since Friday … Over in Italy , the number of confirmed NNS has surpassed 300 to 322 , while the number of dead climbed to 10 , according to Italian emergency chief Angelo Borrelli , who VBD the newly deceased were over the age of 80 . That ’s up from just 20 confirmed NNS on Friday . Newly deceased were over 80 NNS old , VBZ at press conference in Rome Tuesday . The JJ infections include three NNS in southern Sicily region , Italian Civil Protection official Borrelli VBD . All of a sudden , NNS all over Europe are wanting to avoid Italians because of the potential of catching the NN . In most NNS that fear is irrational , but we do VB that an Italian just spread the NN to a hotel in Spain ’s Canary Islands … Hundreds of staff and tourists staying at a hotel in Spain ’s Canary Islands were put under lockdown on Tuesday , El Pais newspaper reported . CD person who had stayed at the establishment was later VBN to have tested positive for the NN . I lived in Italy for a few NNS as a NN , and I have a great love for the country . It is so sad to watch what is happening over there , but the same things are VBG to start happening here . In fact , Dr. Messonnier has VBN the public that now is the NN “ to begin preparing ” for a massive outbreak … “ NNS are concerned about this situation – I MD say rightfully so , ” Messonnier VBD . “ But we are putting our concerns to work preparing . Now is the NN for businesses , hospitals , communities , schools and everyday NNS to begin preparing as well . ” If you do prepare and all of this turns out to be a false alarm , at least you will be ready for the next crisis that is coming . But if you do n’t do anything to prepare and things VBP really , really bad , it MD end up costing you dearly . If this NN starts spreading across the NNP NNPS IN wildfire , you and your family will VB to minimize contact with the public as much as possible . So stock up on the things you will need now , because when things start getting really crazy the stores will be cleaned out very quickly . NN spreads to Germany , Switzerland , Croatia , Iraq , Spain , Algeria , Austria and Brazil while NNS explode in Italy by 45 % in CD day Over the last 36 hours or so , the NN spread has now been confirmed in a slew of JJ NNS , including Germany , Switzerland , Croatia , Iraq , Spain , Algeria and Austria . NNS are already confirmed in Belgium , Lebanon , Finland , Sweden , Egypt , Sri Lanka , Israel , Cambodia , Nepal , Afghanistan , Russia and JJ other NNS . An infection is now suspected in Brazil , which MD make it the JJ South American nation to confirm a NN infection , bringing the NN to a whole JJ continent . According to Brazil ’s NNP Ministry , CD test of a local patient has reportedly come RB positive . A second confirmation test is necessary to make the diagnosis “ official . ” These are irrefutable facts , yet we still have naysayers throughout the NN and across the cultural landscape who claim none of this is happening , that the NN bioweapon system is “ just another NN , ” or that it ’s a grand hoax being perpetrated by all these NNS as some elaborate staged event to commit JJ suicide for some unknown reason . NN denialism is essentially the “ NNP NNP ” version of epidemiology . According to the denialists , all the nations listed above are faking it , sacrificing their national economics to carry out some sort of elaborate hoax for some unimaginable reason . Rush Limbaugh , meanwhile , still insists the NN is just “ the NN . ” It ’s a reminder why highly influential NNS should stick to their areas of expertise and not wander into areas where they very quickly demonstrate their shocking technical ignorance and lack of knowledge . NN infections exploded overnight in Italy , rising to 322 confirmed NNS , an increase of 100 from the previous day . To try to stop the spread of the NN , Italy is running armed road blocks surrounding 12 towns , prohibiting road travel . According to The Epoch Times , no NN in Italy RB knows the source of the outbreak , completely obliterating any argument from WHO officials that this is “ contained ” or “ not a NN . ” Via TET : Italian NN officials have n’t yet identified the source of the outbreak . Angelo Borrelli , the head of the Italian civil protection department , VBD the case count grew from 222 to 322 , representing a 45 % increase , in a 24 - hour period from Monday evening to Tuesday evening . According to the NN denialists , of course , Italy must be faking it for some reason . Yes , it ’s an insane idea , but that ’s what is now being promoted by the left - wing NN and RB some conservative journalists . Notably , the very bureaucrat in Iran who VBD everybody the NN was no big deal is now infected himself . RB via TET : Only a day earlier , a coughing and heavily sweating Iraj Harirchi VBD at a televised NN conference in Tehran that “ the situation is almost stable in the country . ” NNP Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour confirmed Harirchi had the NN . Harirchi himself posted an online NN saying he had it and that he had quarantined himself at home . He promised that authorities MD bring the NN under NN . That ’s reassuring , huh ? The very NN bureaucrat sitting in quarantine after accidentally getting infected is telling us all the NN has it under NN . The irony is almost pure comedy , if it were n’t so tragic . San Franciso declares NN of emergency while NN tells us there ’s no emergency at all San Francisco , meanwhile , has just declared a NN of emergency over the NN , RB when CDC officials claim there are essentially zero confirmed NNS in San Francisco . According to the SF Chronicle , Mayor London Breed VBD more resources need to be allocated , “ to make sure we are prepared , ” RB while the entire NN establishment in America claims there ’s nothing to be prepared for in the JJ place . So why did San Fran just declare an emergency , then ? The CDC ’s insane policy of “ Do n’t Test , Do n’t Tell ” is keeping America in the dark while the epidemic explodes across U.S. cities ."

Political leaders keep close tabs on it . Others VBP out disparage it . Indeed , uranium owns its share of controversy . For NNS , the element has been tied to talk of nuclear weapons and the birth of the atomic age . Today , however , the metal has taken on a different role -- in the form of NN . In fact , much of the enriched uranium stored in nuclear weapons from the arms race has been rededicated to fueling the NN 's nuclear power reactors , which provided the NN with almost 14 percent of its electricity in 2010 [ source : Nuclear NNP Institute ] . And it 's extremely powerful , too . CD 7 - gram pellet of uranium fuel produces as much NN as 3.5 barrels of oil and 807 kilograms ( 1,779 pounds ) of coal [ source : Newfoundland Labrador DNR ] . Beyond lighting up homes and businesses through nuclear power , uranium makes radioisotopes that produce radiation , which can VB diagnose and treat certain medical conditions . It 's RB used for shielding and , in its depleted form , as counterweights for aircraft , too . But where does uranium come from and how is it gathered ? IN other metals , uranium occurs naturally in rocks on the NNP 's NN and can be extracted through uranium mining . Miners originally discovered uranium alongside radium , another element that was used as glowing , decorative paint ( at least until NNS realized its harmful , radioactive effects ) . Uranium hit the market as a decorative glaze before its nuclear properties were discovered . This heavy metal comes in several isotopes , or forms of the element with different numbers of neutrons . Depending on the stability of an isotope , some can be more radioactive ( likely to give off energetic particles ) and fissile ( likely to produce nuclear fission ) than others . Uranium - 238 measures as the most abundant isotope of the element on NNP and can be VBN in rocks and seawater . But it 's not as radioactive as uranium - 235 , the best - VBN form of uranium used to create nuclear reactions . In this article , we 'll chart the uranium mining process , tracking the element as it transitions from ore to fuel pellets ready to be used by nuclear reactors . We 'll RB look at the wax and wane of uranium mining , as well as the risks for humans and the environment by following the contentious debate over mining uranium in the backyard of the U.S. 's most iconic canyon .

Eclipsed by a related NN NN , Qanon , NN has decreased in popularity in part due to crackdowns by online platforms .

In over 30 different open and closed NNP groups , boasting more than 40,000 collective members , NN followers have kept the NN alive . In the face of reason , these NN adherents have held tightly to "" evidence "" — mostly what they allege is coded language and symbols that link shapes to pedophelia and food products IN cheese and pasta to NNS . The members post misinformation and wild allegations linking just about anyone to a NN - wide pedopehila ring . Their targets have included everyone and everything from local businesses to Tom Hanks to a random NNP user wearing a t - shirt with the image of a slice of pizza on it . This week , a major topic of conversation has been Celine Dion 's weight loss , which group members falsely attributed to an addiction to Adrenochrome , a real chemical compound that NN conspiracists claim is "" harvested "" from tortured NNS , and taken by the political and Hollywood elite to VB high .

NNP did not respond to a request for comment .

While JJ earthers seem to trust and support scientific methods , what they do n’t trust is NNS , and the established relationships between “ power ” and “ knowledge ” . This relationship between power and knowledge has RB been theorised by sociologists . By exploring this relationship , we can begin to understand why there is a swelling resurgence of JJ earthers . Let me begin by stating quickly that I ’m not really interested in discussing if the NNP is JJ or not ( for the record , I ’m happily a “ globe earther ” ) – and I ’m not seeking to mock or denigrate this community . What ’s important here is not necessarily whether they VBP the NNP is JJ or not , but instead what their resurgence and public conventions , such as the NN in Birmingham , tell us about NN and knowledge in the 21st century . Multiple competing models were suggested throughout the weekend , including “ classic ” JJ NN , domes , NN walls , diamonds , puddles with multiple worlds inside , and RB the NNP as the inside of a giant cosmic egg . The level of discussion however often did not revolve around the models on offer , but on broader issues of attitudes towards existing structures of knowledge , and the institutions that supported and presented these models . JJ earthers are not the JJ group to be sceptical of existing power structures and their tight grasps on knowledge . This viewpoint is somewhat typified by the work of Michel Foucault , a famous and heavily influential 20th century philosopher who made a career of studying those on the fringes of society to understand what they MD tell us about everyday NN . He is well VBN , among JJ other things , for looking at the close relationship between power and knowledge . He suggested that knowledge is created and used in a NN that reinforces the claims to legitimacy of those in power . At the same NN , those in power VBP what is considered to be correct and incorrect knowledge . According to Foucault , there is therefore an intimate and interlinked relationship between power and knowledge . At the NN Foucault was writing on the topic , the NN of power and knowledge had moved away from religious institutions , which previously had a very singular hold over knowledge and morality , and was instead beginning to move towards a network of scientific institutions , NN monopolies , legal courts , and bureaucratised governments . Foucault argued that these institutions work to maintain their claims to legitimacy by controlling knowledge . In the 21st century , we are witnessing another important shift in both power and knowledge due to factors that include the increased availability of public platforms afforded by JJ NN . Knowledge is no longer centrally controlled and – as has been pointed out in the wake of Brexit – the age of the expert MD be passing . Now , everybody has the power to create and share content . When Michael Gove , a leading proponent of Brexit , proclaimed : “ I VBP the NNS of this country have had enough of experts ” , it MD seem that he , in JJ ways , meant it . It is RB clear that we ’re seeing increased polarisation in society , as we continue to drift away from agreed singular narratives and move into camps around shared interests . Recent PEW NN suggests , for example , that 80 per cent of voters who backed Hillary NNP in the 2016 US presidential election – and 81 per cent of NNP voters – VB most supporters of the CD candidates are unable to agree on basic facts , let alone policies . Despite early claims , from as far RB as HG Wells ’s NNP Brain essays in 1936 , that a worldwide , shared resource of knowledge , such as the internet , MD create peace , harmony and a common interpretation of reality , it appears that quite the opposite has happened . With the increased voice afforded by JJ NN to a wide range of views , knowledge has been increasingly decentralised , and competing narratives have emerged . This was something of a recurring theme throughout the weekend in Birmingham , and was especially apparent when four JJ earthers debated three physics PhD students . A particular point of contention occurred when CD of the physicists pleaded with the audience to avoid trusting NNP and bloggers . The audience and the panel of JJ earthers took exception to this , noting that “ now we ’ve got the internet and mass communication … we ’re not reliant on what the mainstream are telling us in newspapers , we can decide for ourselves ” . It was readily apparent that the JJ earthers were keen to separate knowledge from scientific institutions . At the same NN as scientific claims to knowledge and power are being undermined , some power structures are decoupling themselves from scientific knowledge , moving towards a kind of populist politics that is increasingly sceptical of knowledge . This has , in recent NNS , manifested itself in extreme ways – and can be seen in such examples as public figures showing support for NNP or NNP ’s suggestions that Ted Cruz ’s father shot JFK . But it can RB be seen in more subtle and insidious forms : in the NN in which Brexit , for example , was campaigned for in terms of gut feelings and emotions rather than expert statistics and predictions . NN is increasingly facing problems with its ability to communicate ideas publicly , a problem that JJ earthers , and politicians , are able to circumvent with moves towards populism . Again , this theme occurred throughout the weekend . JJ earthers were encouraged to trust “ poetry , freedom , passion , vividness , creativity , and yearning ” over the more clinical regurgitation of established theories and facts . Attendees were VBN that “ hope VBZ everything ” , and were warned against blindly trusting what they were VBN . This is a narrative echoed by some of the celebrities who have used their power to VB JJ NNP beliefs , such as the musician BOB , who tweeted : “ Do n’t VB what I say , VB what I say . ” In JJ ways , a public meeting of JJ earthers is a product and sign of our NN ; a reflection of our increasing distrust in scientific institutions , and the moves by power - holding institutions towards populism and emotions . In much the same NN that Foucault reflected on what JJ outcasts MD reveal about our JJ systems , there is a lot that JJ earthers can reveal to us about the current changing relationship between power and knowledge . And judging by the success of this UK event – and the JJ conventions planned in Canada and America this NN – it seems the JJ NNP is VBG to be around for a while yet .

BASF , a German chemical NN , announced on 16 January that it will end production of GM crops for the European market and move its plant - NN headquarters from Limburgerhof in Germany to the NNP NNPS . It will RB close other sites in Germany and Sweden , though it will maintain existing facilities in Belgium and Berlin . “ There is still a lack of acceptance for this technology in JJ parts of Europe from the majority of consumers , farmers and politicians , ” VBZ Stefan Marcinowski , a member of BASF ’s board . “ It does not make business sense to continue investing in products exclusively for cultivation in this market . ” BASF will discontinue the marketing of the Amflora potato , CD of only CD GM crops authorised for cultivation by the European Commission . This will leave Monsanto ’s MON810 maize as the only GM crop authorised for cultivation and marketed in the EU . JJ campaigners cheered the move as a vindication of European consumers ’ rejection of the technology . “ It ’s not often that we share an analysis with BASF , but they ’re JJ that there ’s no demand , ” VBZ Mute Schimpf , a food campaigner with Friends of the NNP . But the biotechnology sector warned that Europe risks falling behind its JJ competitors because of “ scaremongering and misinformation ” about this emerging NN , which VBZ the DNA of crops to make them more efficient . Werner Langen , a German centre - JJ MEP , VBZ that the decision by BASF “ shows that the patchwork of national regulations made in this field has made Europe an unattractive location ” for GM NN . While authorisations of GM crops have increased steadily in other parts of the NN , particularly the Americas , approval has been stalled in Europe for several NNS because of political opposition . Around 50 GM crops grown outside the EU have been authorised for import , mostly used for industrial use or animal feed . Member NNS remain divided over the issue of GM crops . A blocking minority of NNS – including Austria , Hungary , Poland and Greece – has refused to accept JJ authorisations for GM cultivation . This has irritated pro-GM NNS such as the Netherlands , Spain , Sweden and the UK , which are eager to deploy the technology . The Commission has been able to authorise only these CD crops for cultivation , and some member NNS have imposed national bans . These bans were eventually VBN to be illegal under single market rules . Seeking a compromise , the Commission proposed allowing member NNS to enact their own national bans , with the implicit understanding that in exchange they MD stop blocking JJ authorisations . But the proposal has remained stalled because the anti-GM NNS VBP to be able to ban the crops on the basis of JJ or NN concerns . The Commission argues that this is not possible , because food cannot be deemed safe in CD country but unsafe in another . Last week ’s announcement by BASF that it is abandoning its production of GM crops in Europe because of a lack of acceptance “ from the majority of consumers , farmers and politicians ” was an acknowledgement of a reality JJ biotechnology NNS have been hesitant to countenance – Europe does not VB genetically modified crops . A 2010 Eurobarometer survey VBD that 70 % of Europeans VBP that GM food is “ fundamentally unnatural ” , and 59 % say that such food is unsafe for their NN . A 2003 NN NN in the NNP Kingdom VBD that only 2 % of Britons MD be happy to eat GM foods . So - called frankenfood , as the British tabloid press has dubbed them , have had a rough welcome in Europe . In December 2010 CD million signatures calling for a ban on GM crops were delivered to the Commission as the JJ ‘ citizens initiative ’ created by the Lisbon treaty . But Europeans are virtually alone in this staunch resistance to GM crops . In north and south America , genetically modified crops have been introduced into the food chain without anyone much noticing or caring . A 2006 NN by the Pew NNP Group showed that Americans remain largely unaware of the existence of GM crops , with only 40 % having heard of them and only 26 % believing they have eaten them . The majority of Americans say they do not have concerns about GM crops . Public perception has translated into public policy . The EU ’s CD approvals of GM crops for cultivation do not match the more than 80 in the US and 36 in Brazil . China and India are RB approving more GM crops , albeit more cautiously than in the Americas . The European Commission has tried to alleviate member NN concerns about the crops by offering to let them opt out of EU authorisation , but the issue is stuck in the Council . Today 10 % of the NN ’s arable land is growing GM crops . A report published by Friends of the NNP last NN VBD that less than 0.06 % of EU fields contain GM crops . Carel du Marchie Sarvaas of EuropaBio attributes the better reception of GM crops in the NNP NNPS to faster movement by the industry . “ In the US , the technology was already there when the anti-GM movement came on NNS ’s radar , ” he VBZ . “ In the Americas there ’s much greater faith in NN as a tool for progress , and the food industry in the Americas has been very supportive of NN . ” But according to Friends of the NNP , the increased focus in Europe is the result of work by non-governmental organisations to bring the issue to the public ’s attention . “ A lot of European consumers are concerned about the open questions of NN with GM crops , ” she VBZ . “ In north and south America they have no labelling system , and consumers are not aware of what ’s VBG on . ” “ We cannot ignore the massive opposition in Europe , ” VBZ Ladislav Miko , deputy director - general for the food chain in the Commission ’s NN department . “ This is why we VBP the issue needs more clarity and more public NN . ” “ NNS need to be convinced there are benefits for the normal citizen , ” he adds . “ If they VBP the benefit is just for farmers and NNS , NNS wo n’t support that . ” JJ campaigners are urging the anti-GM NNS to stand their ground , saying it is reasonable to have different NN concerns in different NNS . “ Europe is quite diverse , you have specific ecosystems in different member NNS , ” VBZ Schimpf . She is unaware of any other products that have different JJ concerns in different NNS , but VBZ GM crops are unlike other products of concern because they can multiply and they enter the food chain . GM crops have been around for 15 NNS , and to date no adverse NN effects from approved strains have been documented anywhere in the NN . European consumers are already eating meat from animals raised on GM feed imported into the EU , and no adverse NN effects have been VBN . But JJ campaigners say not enough is yet VBN about the NN effects , and more NN is needed before they are embraced . “ The EU needs to follow the precautionary principle , ” VBZ Schimpf . But advocates of GM crops say that such hesitation is foolish when the potential of the technology to solve societal challenges is so JJ . “ We have a rapidly increasing population , we have to produce more food and we have to do it more sustainably , ” VBZ Carel du Marchie Sarvaas , a director with EuropaBio , a pan-European biotechnology industry group . “ The only NN to do that is to produce more from the same amount of land . [ GM crops ] allow farmers to produce more yield per hectare . ” He adds that more efficient crops mean less NN spent tilling the land , translating to fewer CO2 NNS from farm equipment . In Spain , the EU country that has embraced GM crops most enthusiastically , farmers have reported getting from 6 % to 30 % more yield by using Monsanto ’s MON810 maize . Between 2010 and 2011 , Spain saw a 27 % increase in the acreage planted . Portugal , which started planting GM later , saw a 59 % increase during that NN . Much has been made of the potential of GM crops to combat famine in Africa , and Bill Gates has been CD of the leading advocates of the technology to VB developing NNS ( VB interview , Page 4 ) . Strains of drought - resistant maize are currently being developed , as well as NN - resistant strains of staple crops . But JJ groups and governments remain doubtful about the technology . Aside from the perceived uncertainty around NN , campaigners are RB concerned that the use of GM crops is giving rise to pesticide - resistant plants . Biotechnology NNS have insisted that this trend is not linked to the use of GM crops , but is a normal problem encountered when crops are not properly rotated . Ethical objections have RB been raised to the practice of patenting the GM seeds . Farmers normally pay a CD - NN price for seeds , which they can then save and replant . But GM seeds are acquired through the payment of a licence fee for the intellectual property . This was the case for BASF ’s Amflora potato . “ It ’s a democratic question – do we VB to allow a few NNS to VB what we eat ? ” asks Schimpf . But with the rest of the NN increasingly embracing GM crops , is it possible for Europe to be a GM - free continent ? That question is being asked at both a macro and micro level . RB if the anti-GM NNS secure the NN to enact national bans on JJ grounds , there are questions over cross-fertilisation from neighbouring NNS . If Austria enacts a ban , the wind can carry seeds from neighbouring Germany , campaigners warn . EuropaBio rejects this argument . “ Political realism means we accept that the NN forward is that some NNS will choose to grow GM crops and some won’t , ” VBZ du Marchie Sarvaas . “ They can exist as non -GM ‘ islands ’ , ” he VBZ , adding that some farms grow GM crops alongside conventional crops and there is still no cross-fertilisation . “ But Europe cannot determine what the NNS from whom they import grow , and that ’s the challenge . ” This challenge has already been encountered . Last NN the Commission was forced to end its zero - tolerance policy for imports , which barred a shipment from entering the EU if it contained any trace of a GM strain not authorised in the EU . This was changed to a threshold of 0.1 % after some crops were mistakenly sent RB . With so JJ GM crops being used in the Americas , NNS of contamination in imports are a concern . But Schimpf VBZ the embrace of GM crops in the Americas should not pressure the EU into VBG in the same direction . “ For me , it ’s the same as when we have higher labour standards , ” she VBZ . “ We can insist that importers must comply with EU standards . Europe MD n’t authorise a car just because it was authorised in China , we VBP to have our own safety checks . ” With the expansion of GM planting across the NN , the pressure on the EU to make up its mind CD NN or the other will only increase ."

""_''","NNS look for usable clothing among rubble in the Petobo neighborhood which was hit by an earthquake and liquefaction in Palu , Central Sulawesi , Indonesia , October 8 , 2018 . When the violent shaking from a massive magnitude 7.5 earthquake finally stopped , Selvi Susanti stood up and realized something strange was happening . RB , she saw the ground suddenly begin to sink . Then the pavement split beneath her NNS IN a broken dinner plate and started to rise . Terrified , she clung to a small sliver of asphalt and surfed a river of fast - moving mud as it swallowed entire neighborhoods , carrying her higher than coconut trees for a quarter of a mile . "" What I saw — oh my NNP ! Houses were tumbling . They started to roll IN waves . It 's IN a tsunami , but the difference was they were waves of soil , "" VBD Susanti , 38 , weeping at the memory of seeing so JJ NNS simply disappear into the NN as they screamed for NN . "" It felt IN I was in a boat , moving around . But the difference is I was not in NN , but in the mud . "" JJ , IN Susanti in the devastated village of Petobo , had no idea they were in an area already identified by the NN as a high - NN zone for the devastating geological phenomenon that causes soft ground to liquefy during earthquakes . But Indonesian scientist Gegar Prasetya was n't surprised by any of the events that occurred at dusk on Sept. 28 , killing nearly 2,000 NNS and leaving possibly thousands more missing . He had warned NNS for NNS that the area around Sulawesi island 's Palu Bay had been struck before and was due for another potential combination of factors to create a perfect storm capable of unleashing earthquakes , landslides , tsunami waves and soil liquefaction . "" I knew RB away , "" VBD Prasetya , co-founder of the Tsunami NNP Center Indonesia , who had met with NN officials and residents in the area to try to raise awareness about the threat . "" I posted in our group , and I VBD , ' It 's happened . ' "" Disaster - prone Indonesia , part of the Pacific Basin 's "" Ring of Fire , "" is an archipelago of about 17,000 islands sitting atop numerous fault lines that have produced some of the largest and most deadly earthquakes , tsunamis and volcanic eruptions in recorded history . Other NNS around the NN wondered how this type of earthquake — on a strike - slip fault , which typically does not produce dangerous tsunamis — MD generate waves that surged as high as 6 meters ( 20 NNS ) . He had published a paper nearly CD decades ago highlighting six other tsunamis recorded in the Makassar Strait in the past century , predicting that a repeat event MD be expected roughly every 25 NNS . The last NN occurred in a region north of the city in 1996 . Before that , Palu Bay was hit in 1968 by a very similar magnitude 7.4 quake that generated waves 10 meters ( 33 NNS ) high . "" This CD complete village went to the NN , "" he VBD of the 1968 event . "" You can still VB the trees from the top of the NN . "" Some experts theorize that the Sept. 28 quake , by itself , did n't generate a big wave despite being shallow and near the coast . They 're convinced it was instead the area 's soft soil that served as the real catalyst for disaster . The temblor 's JJ , violent shaking likely triggered CD or more underwater landslides due to unstable sediment deposited on the seafloor by rivers . This disruptive movement MD have created the JJ wall of NN that raced across the open NN until being squeezed into the JJ , narrow bay that surrounds Palu , forcing the wave to grow higher . "" Imagine what happens if you drop a brick in a JJ pond — ripples spread in all directions , "" VBD Robert Hall , a geologist at Royal Holloway NNP of London , who has studied the area . "" Now drop the same size object in a bathtub . The waves can reflect off the sides , can amplify , and MD VB larger in the direction of the length of the bath . "" But it was n't just weak sediment in the NN that gave NN . Wet , sandy soil RB separated and came alive through liquefaction in some areas due to the earthquake 's radical vibrations . The ground simply lost its strength and turned to mush beneath NNS 's NNS , creating mud that acted IN quicksand . NNS , houses , cars and streets were swallowed and covered by a thick carpet of what — just seconds earlier — had been solid NN . Fast - moving landslides RB were launched above ground , possibly causing RB more localized tsunami waves . "" We MD n't necessarily expect to VB all the worst possible factors occurring together , "" VBD Willem De Lange , a scientist from the NNP of Waikato in NNP Zealand who co-authored NN on the area with Prasetya in 2001 . "" Unfortunately this does happen . "" JJ questions remain about exactly what happened in this complex disaster . Prasetya will begin field work with the Indonesian navy this week to try to better understand what occurred under NN , and a team of international experts are expected to arrive next month to carry out an assessment . Palu 's population has exploded in JJ high - NN areas since the 1968 event , which killed 200 NNS and RB turned soil to mud in places , leaving JJ newcomers vulnerable with no local history . However , the central NN did produce a map in 2012 identifying JJ swaths of Palu , a city of 380,000 NNS , where liquefaction MD occur . The area of Petobo , for instance , was classified as having high - NN potential . The report RB recommended that housing and industrial areas should best be built in areas with low liquefaction NN . It suggested mitigation efforts , including building structures with deep foundations anchored into firmer layers of NN . Good urban planning is ultimately the key to saving lives , VBD Sri Hidayati , head of earthquake mitigation at the NNP Ministry 's Geology Agency , which produced the report that was shared with the provincial and district governments in Sulawesi . She VBD it 's her agency 's responsibility to provide the mapping , but it 's up to local authorities to "" use it or not . "" Calls Monday to Palu 's vice mayor and the mayor 's aid went unanswered . "" If everything in the future is planned based on this , I VBP maybe we will only experience a small number of casualties in case such a disaster occurs again , "" she VBD . "" Or probably no casualties at all . "" At a NN conference in Jakarta on Monday , the head of the country 's disaster agency RB confirmed that soft soil areas in Palu are not fit for housing . "" It is impossible to rebuild in areas with high liquefaction NN such as Petobo and Balaroa , "" he VBD , adding that NNS still living there will be relocated . Indonesia has been criticized for lifting the tsunami warning it issued for Sulawesi 's coast too soon . The earthquake knocked out power and telecommunication towers , meaning sirens did n't wail and alerts did n't light up mobile phones . Online NN showed an unsettling scene as cars and motorbikes drove at normal speeds on a coastal road and oblivious NNS milled about on the beach while the JJ , fast - moving wave MD be seen racing closer before exploding onshore . "" It 's almost impossible for a tsunami warning system to predict what we saw the other day , "" VBD Adam Switzer , a tsunami expert at the NNP Observatory of Singapore . "" The earthquake is the warning . If you 're anywhere in southeast Asia and you 're on the coast and you feel an earthquake , move inland and move to higher ground and stay there . "" But it 's RB not a matter of only warning NNS just before something happens . Prasetya VBD the history and geology of Palu Bay must be considered in plans to rebuild . He VBD soil investigations should be carried out to determine if deep piles are needed to stabilize buildings . Local knowledge should RB be considered as a cheap NN to save lives , such as constructing houses out of wood with thatched roofs , instead of concrete and tile . In Petobo , tsunami warnings MD not have helped because there was no NN to respond . All that remains of the village , located about 30 minutes from the center of Palu , is a muddy wasteland where only the very tips of roofs remain above ground in places . Satellite images show a heavily populated area stretching more than 100 hectares ( 250 acres ) being devoured by what looks IN a giant layer of chocolate milk . In mobile phone videos , buildings are seen sliding IN pucks across a slab of NN . Some NNS spent hours trying to find their homes after the disaster , locating them about 2 kilometers ( 1.2 miles ) from where they once stood . "" It felt IN we were spinning in a blender , "" recalled Susanti , who survived by leaping to solid ground and running after the mud flow finally slowed down . "" I saw houses VB position . Houses which were located at the east moved to the west and vice versa . I saw the twisted mud was shaped IN dough . "" Recovering bodies from Petobo and other hard - hit areas , such as Balaroa , has been difficult because heavy equipment will sink in the soft soil and is unusable there . The NN is considering turning some of these sites into mass graves , according to Wiranto , Indonesia 's security minister , who uses CD name . "" It is already a ghost village . I will not VB RB there RB if they pay me 1 billion rupiah ( $ 65,800 ) , "" VBD Erli Yati , 32 , who RB survived what 's been dubbed a "" land tsunami "" by some in Petobo . She had no idea about the previous disasters there or that the ground MD come alive as it did . "" I will not step RB to that place again , "" she added . "" That was the worse experience I have ever had . "" Prasetya commended the idea of closing off liquefaction areas and VBD mitigation — whether it 's creating and enforcing proper building codes in at - NN zones or relocating NNS to safer places — should be implemented before the next disaster . "" How JJ souls need to be sacrificed until the NN knows mitigation is important ? "" he asked , adding he 's been sounding alarms since the massive 2004 earthquake - spawned tsunami off Sumatra island killed 230,000 NNS in a dozen nations , more than half of them in Indonesia . "" Everything is RB to business as usual . """

The Hayabusa2 spacecraft 's Mobile Asteroid NNP Scout ( MASCOT ) will land at a site in the asteroid Ryugu 's southern hemisphere dubbed MA - 9 , mission officials announced today ( Aug. 23 ) . MA - 9 won out over nine other finalists because it offered the best combination of scientific potential and accessibility , MASCOT team members VBD . [ Japan 's Hayabusa2 Asteroid Sample - Return Mission in Pictures ] "" From our perspective , the selected landing site means that we engineers can guide MASCOT to the asteroid 's NN in the safest NN possible , while the NNS can use their various instruments in the best possible NN , "" MASCOT project manager Tra-Mi Ho , of the DLR Institute of NNP Systems , VBD in a statement . ( DLR is the German Aerospace Center , which operates MASCOT with support from the French NN agency , CNES . ) MA - 9 features relatively fresh , pristine NN material that has n't been exposed to cosmic radiation for RB compared to other parts of the 3,000 - NN - wide ( 950 meters ) asteroid , team members VBD . And Hayabusa2 will drop three small rovers onto patches of the NN rock 's northern hemisphere , so a southern site for the 22 - lb. ( 10 kilograms ) MASCOT will give the mission greater coverage of the NN rock , they added . In addition , MA - 9 is n't quite as boulder - studded as most other Ryugu regions . That does n't mean landing there will be a breeze on Oct. 3 , however . "" But we are RB aware : There seem to be JJ boulders across most of Ryugu 's NN and barely [ any ] surfaces with JJ regolith , "" Ho added . "" Although scientifically very interesting , this is RB a challenge for a small lander and for sampling . "" The $ 150 million Hayabusa2 mission launched in December 2014 and arrived at Ryugu on June 27 of this NN . If all goes according to plan , the spacecraft will VB the big asteroid from orbit for another 16 months and RB drop down several times to grab samples of Ryugu material . Meanwhile , MASCOT and the three tiny , hopping rovers — VBN as Minerva - II - 1a , Minerva - II - 1 b and Minerva - II - 2 — will gather a variety of NN about the asteroid from its NN . ( Minerva - I flew aboard Japan 's JJ asteroid - sampling mission , the original Hayabusa , which returned grains from the NN rock Itokawa to NNP in 2010 . ) The Hayabusa2 orbiter is scheduled to depart from Ryugu in December 2019 . The capsule containing the mission 's asteroid samples will come down to NNP a NN later , in December 2020 . Hayabusa2 is n't the only asteroid - sampling project underway . NASA 's $ 800 million OSIRIS - REx ( Origins , Spectral Interpretation , Resource Identification , Security , Regolith Explorer ) mission is on its final approach toward the asteroid Bennu , and should arrive in orbit around the 1,650 - NN - wide ( 500 m ) rock this December . OSIRIS - REx's samples are due to land on NNP in September 2023 . Both Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS - REx aim to VB NNS better understand asteroid composition and structure , the early history and evolution of the solar system , and the role NN rocks MD have played in helping NN VB a start on NNP .

In a speech to Indonesian students , civic leaders and NN officials , Kerry tore into NN NN skeptics . He accused them of using shoddy NN and NNS to delay steps needed to reduce NNS of greenhouse gases at the NN of imperiling the planet . A day earlier , the U.S. and China announced an agreement to cooperate more closely on combating NN NN . American officials hope that will VB encourage others , including developing NNS IN Indonesia and India , to follow suit . China and the NNP NNPS are the biggest sources of NNS of NN dioxide and other gases that VBP the NN to trap solar heat and alter the NN . NNS say such NNS are leading to drought , wildfires , rising NN levels , melting polar NN , plant and animal extinctions and other extreme conditions . RB in the Jakarta speech , Kerry VBD everyone and every country must take responsibility for the problem and act immediately . "" We simply do n't have NN to let a few loud interest groups hijack the NN conversation , "" he VBD , referring to what he called "" big NNS "" that "" do n't VB to VB and spend a lot of money "" to act to reduce the risks . Kerry later singled out major oil and coal concerns as the primary offenders . "" We should not allow a tiny minority of shoddy NNS and NN and extreme ideologues to compete with scientific facts , "" Kerry VBD the audience at a U.S. Embassy - run American Center in a shopping mall . "" Nor should we allow any room for those who VBP that the costs associated with doing the JJ thing outweigh the benefits . "" "" The NN is unequivocal , and those who refuse to VB it are simply burying their heads in the sand , "" Kerry VBD . "" We do n't have NN for a meeting anywhere of the NNP NNP Society , "" Kerry VBD the cost of inaction will far outweigh the significant expense of reducing greenhouse NN NNS that trap solar heat in the NN and contribute to the NNP 's rising temperatures . He outlined a litany of recent weather disasters , particularly flooding and typhoons in Asia , and their impact on commerce , agriculture , fishing and daily living conditions for billions of NNS . "" This city , this country , this region , is really on the front lines of NN NN , "" Kerry VBD . "" It 's not an exaggeration to say that your entire NN of NN here is at NN . "" He added : "" In a sense , NN NN can now be considered the NN 's largest weapon of mass destruction , perhaps RB , the NN 's most fearsome weapon of mass destruction . "" The solution , Kerry VBD , is a JJ JJ NN policy that shifts reliance from fossil fuels to cleaner technologies . He noted the NNP Barack Obama is championing such a shift and encouraged others to appeal to their leaders to join . The U.S. - China statement issued just after Kerry left Beijing on Saturday VBD the CD NNS agreed on steps to carry out commitments to curb greenhouse gases , including reducing vehicle NNS , improving NN efficiency of buildings and other measures . Beijing and Washington launched a NN NN discussion last NN , promising progress in five areas : reducing vehicle NNS ; advanced electric power grids ; capturing and storing NN NNS ; gathering greenhouse NN data ; and building efficiency . Kerry was in Indonesia on the last leg of a three - nation tour of Asia that started in South Korea . After leaving Indonesia on Monday , he planned to visit Abu Dhabi in the NNP Arab Emirates .

""_''","This week , a particularly odd little bit of pseudoscience reared its head again when rapper B.o.B. took to NNP and proclaimed that the NNP is JJ . Since then , the rapper has drawn the ire of all sorts of incredulous NNS , including astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson . NNS have VBN that the NNP is round since at least the sixth century B.C.E . So JJ were surprised to hear the JJ NNP concept still kicked around . But this was n't the JJ resurgance of the idea . RB in the 1970s and ‘ 80s , a NN named Charles Kenneth Johnson became a minor celebrity for his refusal to VB the NNP is round , Cheryl Eddy writes for iO9 . Johnson ’s good friend Samuel Shenton founded a small fringe group dubbed the NNP NNP Society in the 1950s . In 1972 Johnson became the NN of the society after Shenton 's death , transforming the group from a small collection of NN theorists into an organization with thousands of members . He made waves in the national NN and became VBN for cheerfully insisting the rest of the NN was being duped by NNS , Douglas Martin wrote in Johnson ’s obituary for the NNP York Times in 2001 . '' If NN were a ball spinning in NN , there MD be no up or down , '' Johnson VBD David Gates and Jennifer Smith for Newsweek in 1984 . Similarly , Johnson ’s wife Marjory believed that the NNP must be JJ , because otherwise she MD have spent her childhood in her native Australia hanging upside - down by her toes , Martin wrote at the NN . During his tenure as NN of the NNP NNP Society , its ranks swelled to about 3,500 NNS . In his newsletters , Johnson wrote off such spectacles IN the sunrise and sunset as optical illusions , discussed how Charles Lindbergh proved the NNP was JJ , and claimed that NASA and the moon landing were nothing but hoaxes , Eddy writes . "" You ca n't orbit a JJ NN , "" Johnson VBD Robert J. Schadewald for NNP Digest in 1980 . "" The NNP Shuttle is a joke — and a very ludicrous joke . "" Ironically , Johnson lived just over the hill from Edwards Air Force Base in southern California — the facility where the Air Force tests experimental aircraft , and where NASA ’s NNP Shuttles landed after returning to NNP . While most of the articles about Johnson and his fringe beliefs were written with tongue firmly in cheek , he channeled his odd sort of fame into increasing membership in the NNP NNP Society ( as well as a starring role in an NN cream commercial ) . But it did n’t last : By the NN Johnson died , the society had dwindled again to just 100 members . The NNP NNP Society is still around , though they remain little more than a tiny fringe group . "" It is always good to question ' how we VBP what we VBP ' , "" Christine Garwood , author of NNP NNP : The History of an Infamous Idea , tells Brendan O'Neill for the BBC . "" But it is RB good to have the ability to accept compelling evidence — such as the photographs of NNP from NN . """

It will take the JJ - ever direct images of its poles , while RB studying the inner heliosphere — the bubble - JJ region around the sun created by the stream of energized , charged particles released in the solar wind . At its closest , Solar Orbiter will come within about 42 million km of the sun : closer than the scorched planet Mercury , just over a quarter of the average distance between NNP and the sun , and closer than any European spacecraft in history . To VB it into this unique orbit at the center of the solar system , edging close to the sun ’s poles instead of orbiting in a ‘ JJ ’ plane , IN the planets , teams at mission NN in Darmstadt , Germany , have planned an intricate path . Solar Orbiter is due to launch from Cape Canaveral , Florida , on an Atlas V 411 rocket supplied by NASA in early February . Once it has separated from the launch vehicle , a 22 - minute automatic activation sequence takes place , after which point the NN team takes over the reins for the Launch and Early Orbit Phase ( LEOP ) . These early moments in the NN of a mission are critical . It is now that the spacecraft wakes up , extends its solar arrays and teams on the ground check its NN after the rigors of launch . Elements of Solar Orbiter ’s NN instruments are located along a 4.4 meter ‘ boom , ” which keeps them away from the main NN of the spacecraft and any potential interference . This boom should be deployed before certain chemical thrusters are fired , which have the potential to contaminate the instruments during maneuvres . Once Solar Orbiter ’s systems and instruments are up and running , it enters into the “ cruise phase , ” which will last until November 2021 . During this NN , it will perform CD gravity - assist maneuvres around Venus and CD around NNP to alter the spacecraft ’s trajectory , guiding it towards the innermost regions of the solar system . The JJ close solar pass will take place at the end of March 2022 at around a third of the distance between NNP and the sun . At this point , the spacecraft will be in an elliptical orbit that initially takes 180 days to complete , making a close approach of the sun every six months . Solar Orbiter ’s path will VB it travel out of the ‘ plane of the ecliptic . ” So , instead of orbiting in the same JJ plane around the sun as the planets , moons and minor bodies of the solar system , it will ‘ leap ’ up from the solar equator , delivering views of the sun ’s polar regions that have never been seen before . To do this , Solar Orbiter will not travel in a ‘ fixed ’ orbit . Instead , the spacecraft will follow a constantly changing elliptical path that will be continually tilted and squeezed , edging it higher and higher and closer to the sun ’s poles . As such , the spacecraft ’s orbit has been chosen to be ‘ in resonance ’ with Venus , which means that it will return to the planet ’s vicinity every few orbits and can again use the planet ’s gravity to alter or tilt its orbit . While Solar Orbiter initially orbits in the same ‘ JJ ’ plane as the planets of the solar system , each encounter with Venus will increase its inclination . This means that each NN Solar Orbiter encounters the sun , it will be looking at it from a different perspective . By the end of 2021 , the spacecraft will reach its JJ nominal orbit for NN , which is set to last for four NNS . During this NN , Solar Orbiter will reach 17° degrees of inclination , allowing the spacecraft to capture high - resolution images of the sun ’s poles , for the JJ NN . During its proposed extended mission phase , Solar Orbiter MD lift into an RB higher inclination orbit . At 33° above the solar equator , the polar regions MD come RB more directly into view . Data gathered by Solar Orbiter will be stored on the spacecraft , then beamed ( or , ‘ downlinked ’ ) to NNP during eight - hour communication windows , via the 35 m Malargüe ground station in Argentina . Other Estrack stations such as NNP Norcia in Australia and Cebreros in Spain will act as backups . To survive getting so up - close and personal with our star , experiencing a maximum temperature of 520 degrees Celsius and receiving a barrage of intense radiation , Solar Orbiter ’s main NN and vital instruments will be protected by a titanium heat shield that will face the sun at all times . RB the spacecraft ’s solar panels , designed to take in NN from the sun , will need to be protected . As Solar Orbiter edges closer to the giant ball of heat and radiation , its panels — sticking out either side of the spacecraft , bringing it to 18.9 m across — will need to tilt away from the sun , limiting the amount of light they take in to ensure they do not overheat .

He did n’t VB that Americans had landed on the moon . In his estimation such a technological feat was simply not possible . Caught up in the excitement of Apollo 11 that summer , I MD not understand my grandfather ’s denial . In his insular NN , NN came grudgingly , however , and a moon landing was certainly a major NN . At the NN of his death , in 1984 , Jeff Launius remained unconvinced . NNP Bill NNP recalled in his 2004 autobiography a similar NN of a carpenter he worked with in August 1969 , not RB after the Apollo 11 landing : “ The old carpenter asked me if I really believed it happened . I VBD sure , I saw it on television . He disagreed ; he VBD that he did n’t VB it for a minute , that “ them television fellers ” MD make things look real that were n’t . ” NNP York Times NN reporter John Noble Wilford remarked in December 1969 that “ a few stool - warmers in Chicago bars are on record as suggesting that the Apollo 11 moon walk last July was actually staged by Hollywood on a Nevada desert . ” The Atlanta Constitution led a NN on June 15 , 1970 , with “ JJ skeptics feel moon explorer Neil Armstrong took his ‘ giant step for mankind ’ somewhere in Arizona . ” While poll numbers questioning the moon landing in Detroit , Miami and Akron averaged less than 5 percent , among African - Americans in such places as Washington , D.C. , a whopping 54 percent doubted the moon voyages . That perhaps VBD more about the disconnectedness of minority communities from the Apollo effort and the nation ’s overarching racism than anything else . As the NN reported , “ A woman in Macon VBD she knows she MD n’t watch a telecast from the moon because her set MD n’t RB pick up NNP York stations . ” As historian Howard McCurdy opined , “ To some , the thrill of NN ca n’t hold a candle to the thrill of NN . ” An early and persistent theme has been that as a Cold War measure the NNP NNPS MD not afford to lose the race to the moon , but when failure loomed , NASA faked the landing to save face and national prestige . It used the massive funds dedicated to the effort to “ pay off ” those who might be persuaded to tell the NN ; it RB used threats and in some instances criminal actions to stop those who might blow the whistle . Another common assertion has been that in the latter 1960s , with the U.S. NN in disarray because of the debacle of the Vietnam War , the racial crisis in the cities , and JJ upheaval , the Apollo program proved an ideal , positive distraction from this strife , a convenient NN designed to obscure other issues . CD NN published in 1970 stated this belief as expressed by an African - American preacher : “ It ’s all a deliberate effort to mask problems at home , ” Newsweek quoted him saying . “ The NNS are unhappy — and this takes their minds off their problems . ” The JJ NN theorist to make a sustained case for denying that the U.S. landed on the moon was Bill Kaysing , a journalist who had been employed for a few NNS in the public relations office at Rocketdyne , Inc. , a NASA contractor , in the early 1960s . His 1974 pamphlet We Never Went to the Moon laid out JJ of the major arguments that have been followed by other NN theorists since . His rationale offered poorly developed logic , sloppily analyzed data and sophomorically argued assertions . Kaysing believed that a failure to land on the moon sprang from the idea that NASA lacked the technical expertise to accomplish the task , requiring the creation of a massive cover - up to hide that fact . He cited as evidence perceived optical anomalies in some imagery from the Apollo program , questioned the physical features of certain objects in the photographs ( such as a lack of a star field in the background of lunar NN imagery and a presumed waving of the U.S. flag in an airless environment ) , and challenged the possibility of NASA astronauts ’ surviving a trip to the moon because of radiation exposure . As John Schwartz wrote of the NN theorists in the NNP York Times , “ They examine photos from the missions for signs of studio fakery , and claim to be able to tell that the American flag was waving in what was supposed to be the vacuum of NN . They overstate the NN risks of traveling through the radiation belts that girdle our planet ; they understate the technological prowess of the American NN program ; and they cry murder behind every death in the program , linking them to an overall NN . ” Ted Goertzel , a professor of sociology at Rutgers NNP who has studied NN theorists , VBD Schwartz that “ there ’s a similar kind of logic behind all of these groups . ” For the most part , he explained , “ They do n’t undertake to prove that their view is true ” so much as to “ find flaws in what the other side is saying . ” And so , he VBD , argument is a matter of accumulation instead of persuasion . “ They feel if they ’ve got more facts than the other side , that proves they ’re JJ . ” Kaysing insisted , without any evidence whatsoever , that RB though the Soviet Union was watching the American effort closely , it was easier to successfully VB it than actually to land on the moon . He RB speculated that the chance of landing successfully on the moon stood at 0.017 ; on what this calculation was based is a mystery and does not square with NASA estimates at the NN , which stood at approximately 87 percent for at least CD successful landing before the end of the 1960s . Some moon - landing deniers concede that there were robotic missions to the moon , but that the JJ Apollo landings were faked . Professional moon - landing denier Bart Sibrel has asserted that Apollo spacecraft crews had faked their orbit around the moon and their walk on its NN by using trick photography , but did accept NNP orbital missions . Humans MD not VB to the moon , Sibrel and deniers of his ilk claim , because VBG beyond the Van Allen radiation belts MD have given them lethal doses of cosmic radiation . While there is indeed radiation both in the Van Allen belts and beyond , and radiation ’s risks to JJ NN are real , contentions that it MD not be survivable are nonsense , and almost no papers in peer - reviewed scientific journals make this claim . A few NN theorists in this category RB allow that NASA landed robotically on the moon various passive reflector mirrors used for laser ranging and other JJ - made objects to bamboozle the public . Then , there are those who VBP that humans went to the moon , but did so with the assistance of extraterrestrial visitors — or that Apollo astronauts discovered extra-terrestrial NN there . These claims ranged from gravitational anomalies to alien artifacts to alien encounters . Accordingly , this brand of NN theorist claims that NASA covered up what had been VBN , in the manner of the discovery of a monolith at Clavius Crater on the Moon in 2001 : A NNP Odyssey . NN theorist Richard Hoagland has asserted for JJ NNS that the Apollo program discovered JJ artificial glass structures on the lunar NN that has been kept from the public . Besides other conventions common in a cover - up , Hoagland made the claim that the astronauts that went to the moon had been hypnotized and any memories of extraterrestrial encounters were removed . Most interestingly , Hoagland has argued that NASA deviously orchestrated the origins of the moon - landing denials as a disinformation NN to mask the discovery of extra-terrestrial structures on the lunar NN . In 2009 , he asserted that the NN molecules that NASA ’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter had discovered on the Moon had been leaked from buried extraterrestrial cities . No evidence supported these assertions . While the various claims of the moon - landing deniers have evolved over NN , their reasons for making these claims have rested on several types of “ evidence . ” The most significant are anomalies VBN in photographs or , to a much lesser degree , movies taken on the missions . Imagery has played a critical role in the communication of the experience . While Apollo imagery documented in graphic detail what took place on the moon , the use of that same imagery to raise questions about the entire enterprise is an irony too great to ignore . Some 25 images have been invoked in such claims . These include images that do not show stars in the background , despite NN theorists ’ insistence that they should be clearly seen ; the fact that dust was not present on the landing pads of the spacecraft ; the assertion that shadows and lighting on the moon are uneven and counterintuitive to the photographs in which they are seen ; that flags seem to be blowing in a breeze although there is no wind on the moon ; that some rocks appear to have propmaster marks on them ; and that Réseau - plate crosshairs sometimes seem to disappear behind objects in an image . For each of these charges , there are completely reasonable , understandable , and convincing explanations , most relating to the nature of photography and the vicissitudes of shadows , lighting and exposure of film in a vacuum . Few moon - landing deniers , however , will accept any explanation whatsoever . I have personally had CD say to me , “ Regardless of whatever you might say , I will never VB that humans have landed on the moon . ” Deniers of the moon landing RB point to anomalies in the historical record to cast doubt on the NASA account of the Apollo program . CD of the persistent beliefs is that the “ blueprints ” for the Apollo spacecraft and Saturn V rocket have been lost , or perhaps they never existed . This is simply untrue . The National Archives and Records Administration maintains a regional Federal Records Center at Ellenwood , Georgia , just outside of Atlanta , where the records from the Marshall NNP Flight Center are housed . Those records include more than 2,900 linear NNS of Saturn V records , including drawings and schematics . A similar NN about the loss of the original broadcast NN from the Apollo 11 landing has been used to cast doubt on the whole endeavor , causing NASA to undertake an unprecedented search for the tapes , finding some but not all that were missing . Finally , in this same category of anomalies in the historical record , NN theorists have scrutinized every word uttered by the Apollo astronauts over the NNS to try to catch them in some statement that might be interpreted as denying the landings . Having VBN none , some have resorted to selectively excerpting them and in some NNS to making them up altogether . Bart Sibrel commented , “ Neil Armstrong , the JJ NN to supposedly walk on the moon , refuses to give interviews to anyone on the subject . ‘ Ask me no questions , and I ’ll tell you no lies . ’ Collins RB refuses to be interviewed . Aldrin , who granted an interview , threatened to sue us if we showed it to anyone . ” Sibrel ’s implication is the astronauts have something to hide . Sibrel has gone further , accosting astronauts and demanding that they swear on the Bible that they walked on the moon . Some have done so ; others refuse to engage him . In CD incident on September 9 , 2002 , Sibrel confronted Buzz Aldrin at a Los Angeles hotel and called him a “ liar , a thief , and a coward . ” At that point Aldrin , then 72 NNS old , hit Sibrel with a JJ hook that sent him to his knees . While Sibrel pressed charges , the Los Angeles County District Attorney ’s office declined to pursue the incident . Most NNS who viewed NN of this altercation expressed concern that Aldrin might have hurt his hand . In a truly bizarre turn of events , on August 31 , 2009 , near the 40th anniversary of the JJ moon landing , the satirical publication The Onion published a NN entitled “ NNP Theorist Convinces Neil Armstrong Moon Landing Was Faked . ” The NN had worldwide implications , as it was published as true in several newspapers . CD Bangladeshi newspapers , the Daily Manab Zamin and NNP Nation , apologized afterward for reporting it as fact . It is bad enough when NN theorists VBP such things without foundation ; these then VBP picked up and broadcast by individuals , but when legitimate NN organizations do so it is much more disturbing . As CD commentator about this incident suggested , “ Their excuse : ‘ We thought it was true so we printed it without checking . ’ ” Throughout the latter third of the 20th century and into the 21st , with public confidence in the U.S. NN declining because of Vietnam , Watergate and other scandals and malfeasance , it became somewhat easier for NNS to VB the worst . There has been considerable NN on the parts of society that embrace NN theories of all types . Arguing that conspiracism writ JJ represents a fundamental part of the political system , legal scholar Mark Fenster argues that at sum , denials of the moon landings bring to the fore “ a polarization so profound that NNS end up with an unshakable belief that those in power ‘ simply ca n’t be trusted . ’ ” During a fall 2009 trip to Vladivostok , Russia , I gave four presentations about the moon landings to NN students . In every case , the JJ question from the students was about challenges to the moon - landing account made by NN theorists . All of them channeled the standard criticisms of Apollo made by denialists over the NNS . A radio talk show host , Rob McConnell , declared that listeners to his show The X Zone , offered astounding responses to CD questions — “ Do you VB in ghosts , and did American astronauts really walk on the Moon ? ” — 77 percent of respondents VBD yes to belief in ghosts , and 93 percent VBD that they did not VB that the Moon landings had actually occurred . As Seth Shostak from the SETI Institute remarked about this , “ The respondents VBP in ghosts , but do not VB NASA put NNS on the moon . On the CD hand , you have uncorroborated testimony about noises in the attic . On the other , you have a decade of effort by tens of thousands of engineers and NNS , endless rocket hardware , thousands of photos , and 378 kilograms ( 840 pounds ) of moon rock . ” Shostak was befuddled by this reality of modern American society . Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt was more philosophical . “ If NNS decide they ’re VBG to deny the facts of history and the facts of NN and technology , ” he VBD , “ there ’s not much you can do with them . For most of them , I just feel sorry that we failed in their education . ” There can be no question that the February 2001 airing of the Fox television special NNP NNP : Did We Land on the Moon ? changed the nature of the debate . In this instance , a major network presented a NN scenario without any serious rebuttal that might have been offered . As USA Today reported : “ According to Fox and its respectfully interviewed “ experts ” — a constellation of ludicrously marginal and utterly uncredentialed ‘ investigative journalists ’ — the U.S. grew so eager to defeat the Soviets in the intensely competitive 1960s NN race that it faked all six Apollo missions that purportedly landed on the moon . Instead of exploring the lunar NN , the American astronauts only tromped around a crude movie set that was created by the plotters in the legendary Area 51 of the Nevada desert . ” While the program claimed to “ let the viewer decide ” about the validity of the claims for denial of the moon landings , it made no attempt whatsoever to offer point and counterpoint , thereby giving the viewers a seriously biased view of the issue and skewed evidence in favor of a hoax . The most egregious violation of propriety came in the Fox show when NN theorists claimed that ten astronauts and CD civilians had died “ under mysterious circumstances ” during the Apollo program . The ten astronauts in question included the three who were killed in the Apollo 1 fire of January 27 , 1967 , when their capsule was consumed in a flash fire during ground tests . At CD point , Scott Grissom , son of Apollo 1 mission commander Gus Grissom , who was killed in the incident , claimed , “ My father ’s death was no accident . He was murdered . ” At another point , however , he retracted that statement and declared that “ NASA did n’t murder anyone . ” No question , shoddy workmanship and poor procedures led to those astronauts ’ deaths , and it was a tragic loss . But the deaths of Grissom , Ed White and Roger Chaffee were an accident and not murder . Some moon - landing deniers have claimed that NASA had them killed because Grissom was on the verge of exposing the Apollo program as a fraud . There is not CD scintilla of evidence to support this accusation . The identity of the remaining seven astronauts presumably “ murdered ” by NASA during Apollo is something of a mystery . To be sure , astronaut Ed Givens died in an automobile accident , and astronauts Ted Freeman , C. C. Williams , Elliot NNP and Charlie Bassett died in aircraft accidents , but these were far removed from the conduct of Project Apollo . This accounts for eight astronauts , but those making this claim RB apparently count as astronauts CD other pilots who had nothing to do with the moon - landing program , X - 15 pilot Mike Adams and Air Force Manned Orbiting Laboratory pilot Robert Lawrence . Finally , they claimed that NASA technician Thomas Baron and another NASA civilian , who was unnamed , were murdered to keep the secret of the moon hoax . None of these claims was founded on any credible evidence . The Fox program fueled an explosion in NN theories about the Moon landings and the audience for them . I was inundated with questions from friends and acquaintances — JJ of whom I thought were smarter than that — asking me to explain why the photos showed no stars and why the flag moved . It got to be tiring , and unfortunately it changed my opinion that most NNS are n’t so easily duped . They are . CD NNS who have argued against the value of JJ spaceflight RB came forward to counter the Fox special ’s charges . Robert Park , director of the Washington office of the American Physical Society , dismissed the “ documentary ” with this statement : “ The NN of physical evidence that humans did walk on the Moon is simply overwhelming . ” Marc Norman at the NNP of Tasmania added , “ Fox should stick to making cartoons . I ’m a big fan of ‘ The Simpsons ’ ! ” As folklorist Linda Degh noted , “ The mass NN catapult these half - truths into a kind of twilight zone where NNS can make their guesses sound as truths . Mass NN have a terrible impact on NNS who lack guidance . ” Without a proper rebuttal available from NASA — the agency had an official position before of not responding to what it considered absurd claims — JJ young NNS publicly began to question the Apollo landings . Several astronauts stepped forward to affirm the legitimacy of the program , but others thought the charges too silly RB to warrant response . JJ debated the issues in the emerging NN of the Internet . Indeed , the internet became a haven for NN theorists of all stripes , and with the barrier for publication online so low anyone MD put up any page they wished with any assertions they wished to make . A search of the term “ moon hoax ” recently yielded no fewer than 6,000 sites . NASA had refrained from officially responding to these charges — avoiding anything that might dignify the claims — the Fox show required that it VB its approach . After the Fox program RB aired , NASA released a CD - paragraph press release titled , “ Apollo : Yes , We Did . ” “ Excerpted from Apollo ’s Legacy : Perspectives on the Moon Landings by Roger D. Launius and published by Smithsonian Books ."

This NN 's focus will be on volunteer 's role in shaping sustainable societies . "" NGOs and responsive citizens – the NNS – act at the heart of societies , "" VBD the head of the NNP Nations Volunteers ( UNV ) program , Faliva Pansieri . "" Sustainability and JJ well - being are finally coming to center stage . "" Bonn , the former German capital , is an appropriate venue for the conference , which is expecting some 2,200 participants . Although no longer the seat of the German parliament , the city on the Rhine is now home to 18 UN organizations , which work mainly in the field of sustainable development . In addition , about 170 UN - affiliated NGOs are based in Bonn . "" This NN , the platform is on the subject of changing our lifestyles , our JJ models , our JJ organization and political NN so that we can connect the dots between NN NN , NN , NN and food , "" VBD Maria - Luisa Chavez , the UN's Chief of NGO Relations . The origins of non-governmental , non-profit organizations VBP RB to the 19th century when the JJ anti-slavery groups were founded . Since then , the number of NGOs has skyrocketed . They are especially active in the fields of JJ protection , JJ justice , JJ rights and humanitarian aid . But in recent NNS - between food crises , JJ doldrums and a range of conflicts around the NN - NGOs concerned about how rapidly we are wasting our natural capital are having a tough NN getting their message across . Problems IN NN NN , desertification , resource - use and the loss of NNS have only grown more acute since the 1992 "" NNP Summit , "" which RB saw NGOs invited to take part in UN discussions to tackle these problems . From Rio to Bonn and RB The NNP Summit , which debuted in Rio de Janeiro , will be held for the 20th NN next NN and preparations for Rio+20 are high on the agenda in Bonn this weekend . "" Sustainable development and environment at the moment are not having a good NN , "" VBD Felix Dodds , executive director of the Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future , and the conference chairman . "" I VBP that MD well VB worse unless we make sure that Rio in 2012 gives us a JJ road map to sustainable development . "" He VBD if governments had delivered on the commitments they made in the past then we MD already be on a road to sustainable development . "" Those are now broken promises and broken promises have to stop , "" he added . Things have changed since 1992 , Dodds VBD , and priorities have shifted . Today issues IN NN NN , the connection between the environment and security , and access to food , NN and NN have gained JJ urgency . In addition , consumer behavior in industrialized NNS has widened the gap between the developed and developing NN . But the gap between the wealthy and the struggling within the Western NN has RB grown . Fro Bernward Geier , former director of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements ( IFOAM ) , the NN for action is now . Today he is the coordinator of the German NGOs at the conference – 20 NNS ago he was an enthusiastic participant at the Rio summit . He VBD he 's seen "" too much rhetoric and too little action "" over the NNS and VBZ Rio 2012 is the last chance to really put a program into action before it is too late . "" When I consider the momentum we have here in Bonn and VBP how the German NGO community , which is normally pretty critical of the UN , is getting excited , I feel a little flicker of hope , "" he VBD . "" We have JJ problems and we have to find solutions in a JJ context and then put them into practice on the local and regional level . "" Some have been critical of the number of conferences that are held on development and the environment , saying it has led to a sort of meeting fatigue . But Felix Dodd counters that , saying that only conferences that do n't bring results result in annoyance and weariness . "" Rio will not be a fatigue conference , it will be a successful NN , "" he VBD . "" And so as we are VBG to have a successful NN , the general public and politicians will VB it as an important NN .

The USGS and NASA have taken some of the more interesting images from the Landsat satellites and added some false color , digitally produced by sensors on the satellites , to accentuate different features and create some truly beautiful works of art . The JJ Landsat satellite was launched on July 23 , 1972 . To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Landsat mission , the public was given the difficult task of choosing the best of the more than 120 images in the NNP as Art collection . The top five selections , based on more than 14,000 votes , are featured here in descending order ( above : JJ place ) . Your challenge is to select just CD of these incredible images for your computer desktop . Above : In the style of Van Gogh 's painting "" Starry Night , "" massive congregations of greenish phytoplankton swirl in the dark NN around Gotland , a Swedish island in the Baltic NNP . Population explosions , or blooms , of phytoplankton , IN the NN shown here , occur when deep currents bring nutrients up to sunlit NN waters , fueling the growth and reproduction of these tiny plants . This image was acquired by Landsat 7 on July 13 , 2005 . Image and caption : NASA 's Goddard NNP Flight Center / USGS . Countless lakes , sloughs , and ponds are scattered throughout this scene of the Yukon Delta in southwest Alaska .

Small , blocky shapes of towns , fields , and pastures surround the graceful swirls and whorls of the Mississippi River , the largest river system in North America . Countless oxbow lakes and cutoffs accompany the meandering river south of Memphis , Tennessee , on the border between Arkansas and Mississippi . This image was acquired by Landsat 7 on NNP 28 , 2003 . Image and caption : NASA 's Goddard NNP Flight Center / USGS . What look IN pale yellow paint streaks slashing through a mosaic of mottled colors are ridges of wind - blown sand that make up Erg Iguidi , an area of ever - shifting sand dunes extending from Algeria into Mauritania in northwestern Africa . Erg Iguidi is CD of several Saharan ergs , or sand seas , where individual dunes often surpass 500 meters ( nearly a third of a mile ) in both width and height .

These rival universe shapes anchor the CD sides of the current debate . The rival solutions are the CD “ classical ” expansion histories that a universe can have . Following an initial spurt of cosmic inflation from size zero , these universes steadily expand according to Einstein ’s NN of gravity and NN - NN . Weirder expansion histories , IN football - shaped universes or caterpillar - JJ ones , mostly cancel out in the quantum calculation . CD of the CD classical solutions resembles our universe . On JJ scales , it ’s smooth and randomly dappled with NN , due to quantum fluctuations during inflation . As in the real universe , density differences between regions form a bell curve around zero . If this possible solution does indeed dominate the wave function for minisuperspace , it becomes plausible to imagine that a far more detailed and exact version of the no-boundary wave function might serve as a viable cosmological model of the real universe . The other potentially dominant universe shape is nothing IN reality . As it widens , the NN infusing it varies more and more extremely , creating enormous density differences from CD place to the next that gravity steadily worsens . Density variations form an inverted bell curve , where differences between regions approach not zero , but infinity . If this is the dominant term in the no-boundary wave function for minisuperspace , then the Hartle - Hawking proposal MD seem to be wrong . The CD dominant expansion histories present a choice in how the path integral should be done . If the dominant histories are CD locations on a map , megacities in the realm of all possible quantum mechanical universes , the question is which path we should take through the terrain . Which dominant expansion history , and there can only be CD , should our “ contour of integration ” pick up ? Researchers have forked down different paths . In their 2017 paper , Turok , Feldbrugge and Lehners took a path through the garden of possible expansion histories that led to the second dominant solution . In their view , the only sensible contour is CD that scans through real values ( as opposed to imaginary values , which involve the square roots of negative numbers ) for a variable called “ lapse . ” Lapse is essentially the height of each possible shuttlecock universe — the distance it takes to reach a certain diameter . Lacking a causal element , lapse is not quite our usual notion of NN . Yet Turok and colleagues argue partly on the grounds of causality that only real values of lapse make physical sense . And summing over universes with real values of lapse leads to the wildly fluctuating , physically nonsensical solution . “ NNS place huge faith in Stephen ’s intuition , ” Turok VBD by phone . “ For good reason — I mean , he probably had the best intuition of anyone on these topics . But he was n’t always JJ . ” Jonathan Halliwell , a physicist at Imperial College London , has studied the no-boundary proposal since he was Hawking ’s student in the 1980s . He and Hartle analyzed the issue of the contour of integration in 1990 . In their view , as well as Hertog ’s , and apparently Hawking ’s , the contour is not fundamental , but rather a mathematical tool that can be placed to greatest advantage . It ’s similar to how the trajectory of a planet around the sun can be expressed mathematically as a series of angles , as a series of times , or in terms of any of several other convenient parameters . “ You can do that parameterization in JJ different ways , but none of them are any more physical than another NN , ” Halliwell VBD . He and his colleagues argue that , in the minisuperspace case , only contours that pick up the good expansion history make sense . Quantum mechanics requires probabilities to add to 1 , or be “ normalizable , ” but the wildly fluctuating universe that Turok ’s team landed on is not . That solution is nonsensical , plagued by infinities and disallowed by quantum laws — obvious signs , according to no -boundary ’s defenders , to walk the other NN . It ’s true that contours passing through the good solution sum up possible universes with imaginary values for their lapse variables . But apart from Turok and NN , few NNS VBP that ’s a problem . Imaginary numbers pervade quantum mechanics . To team Hartle - Hawking , the critics are invoking a false notion of causality in demanding that lapse be real . “ That ’s a principle which is not written in the stars , and which we profoundly disagree with , ” Hertog VBD ."

I guess this is the question we all VBP the answer to , and indeed we should . Because inner-standing the vastness and complexity to this Matrix construct and how it operates can only serve to shield and protect ourselves when we do inevitably reach that point . What I am talking about in this blog is based upon NNS of NN , you can take it or leave it . I am not attempting to force this upon NNS merely putting out that of which deeply resonates as NN . The fact is humanity is involved in a soul harvesting trap , I have written about this extensively previously in other blogs . It has been sold to us through ancient indoctrination as simply ‘ reincarnation ’ a method whereby you can come RB and ‘ resolve ’ any outstanding karma on this Planet . This is a falsehood , we have been deceived and tricked and it has been VBG on for JJ JJ NNS . What is happening is that we are being lured and tricked by the false white light and deceivers acting as benevolent beings , who are essentially there to just hook as RB into coming RB down for another dose on Planet crazy . Let me explain further . The whole after death experience is nothing more than an AI simulation . As you die you will VB a tunnel filled with white light , you MD feel immediately drawn to it as there is a familiarity due to what you MD have read or heard about in your physical NN . We must remember that ignorance does n’t die when we die , thats why its so important to seek knowledge in your physical NN , do your own NN , and not be drawn into the JJ traps and deceptions put out there by the Matrix agents in this dimension , those in NN , mainstream NN , and so on . So the white light is the JJ deception , once you enter the white light you will be met with false white light beings . These beings MD masquerade as whatever you admired in your physical NN , maybe some kind of deity , Jesus , Buddha or RB a close family member . These beings VBP us intimately and VBP our blind spots and the ways in which to appeal to our emotions . From there you are taken for a NN review whereby you are shown perhaps certain times in your NN where you MD have hurt someone or made a mistake , they will play on your guilt and emotions once again , and RB deceive us into volunteering to come RB down to NNP by promising that we can come RB to ‘ resolve our karma ’ . In reality all that is happening is that we are being sent RB down to have our NN siphoned again for interdimensionals , entities , and parasitic NN agencies . We are the food they need to feed on , and hence they need us RB down on the feeding ground . Most humans will volunteer quite easily , although most do n’t really VB to come RB down . This is due to ignorance or fear of not ending up in some kind of ‘ heaven ’s they do n’t resolve their karma . Some JJ souls are so tired they VBP to a kind of resting area before they have their memories wiped and are sent RB down into another JJ NN . And so the cycle begins again . So how can we escape this soul trap and where do we VB ? Well , RB of all awareness is key , just RB knowing that this entrapment construct exists is empowering in and of itself . There have been a few theories put forward about what to do and where to VB . The murdered Max Spiers often spoke about VBG into your heart NN . It is my inner-standing that there is a type of grid around this NNP , now this is n’t the place to discuss whether the NNP is JJ or round lets put that aside for CD second , although there is no NN I VBP NASA and the photos that they put out ! This grid , or maybe RB what is depicted as a dome in JJ films , is holding this Matrix construct together so NNS cannot leave and remain entrapped here . What has happened over the last few decades however , is that as NNS start to become more consciously aware and start to ‘ wake up ’ it is creating holes in this grid . Everything we VBP in terms of our own solar system is a holographic projection WITHIN this grid . Its not to say that these Planets do n’t exist , its just that they are within this Matrix grid . Outside the grid it where the REAL freedom and expansiveness of NN lies , a place where we can travel instantly through thought alone , unlike here where we are bound by the constructs of this artificial construct . As I talk about in my blog below , there is a NN out and it involves being strong willed when you leave your physical NN . Clearly its not a good idea to VB to the false white light , nor is it wise to stop and talk to any beings no matter how ‘ friendly ’ they might show themselves to be . The idea is , by using thought ( as you wo n’t have your physical NN anymore ) is to head for the grid , and in particular CD of these holes that I spoke about previously . As the Planet rises in consciousness I estimate that there will be more and more of these holes in the grid . Bypass everything else and navigate your NN through , do this without fear as we are always creating through our thoughts . As you navigate through the same thing applies , use discernment when making decisions and interacting with any beings . Chances are there will be JJ more benevolent forms of consciousnesses in that realm than within the grid but its still good practice to discern . From there you ’re free to explore as your consciousness wants to . My vlog below explains more in detail so check it out and feel free to subscribe to my NNP channel for more NN and viewpoints !

Thousands more gathered at the Cape Canaveral NN centre yesterday , joyously counting down the seconds until the rocket sent a Tesla Roadster on a billion NN journey through NN . But droves of skeptics and disbelievers immediately took to JJ NN platforms to voice their concerns and accuse SpaceX of faking the whole operation . JJ Earthers , who are individuals who cling on to the disproven NN that the NNP is a JJ disk and not an oblate sphere , claimed the stream was CGI . The official NNP NNP Society NNP page VBD today : “ NNS who VBP that the NNP is a globe because ‘ they saw a car in NN on the Internet ’ must be the JJ incarnation of ‘ It 's true , I saw it on TV ! ’ “ It 's a poor argument . Why MD we VB any privately - held NN to report the NN ? ” The group further agued the NN were in on SpaceX ’s agenda , helping out the rocket manufacturer with the alleged deception . The society added in response to a challenger : “ You should n't trust us . You should evaluate claims independently . We 've never advocated for anything else . ” Another NNP user under the handle of Forever NNP , VBD : “ For all of you , who watched the Falcon Heavy . Saw a car VB to NN , saw NO satellites , NO ISS , NO NN debris , NO oblate spheroid , NO spinning NNP , NO escape velocity , NO speeds of 20 kmph , NO stars , just stationary blackness . ” SpaceX founder Elon Musk , entertained the NNP Earthers in a post - launch interview . Mr Musk joked the car looked too “ weird , too crisp ” to be real . Mr Musk VBD : "" You can tell it ’s real because it looks so JJ . "" It ’s just literally a normal car in NN , which I kind of VBP the absurdity of that . "" Those who watched the SpaceX feed saw the expensive electric car breathtakingly hang over the blue planet below , immediately disproving conspiracies the NNP is anything but a globe . From its vantage point thousands of kilometres above the NNP , Mr Musk admitted watching the Roadster and its dummy Starman pilot in real NN was a “ surreal ” experience . You can watch the recorded SpaceX feed in full here : SpaceX Falcon Heavy launch live stream But not everyone was convinced by the stream . JJ truthers questioned the apparent lack of stars against vast expanse of NN , while others pointed out the planet appeared to be stationary . NNP account Prof Brian Hoax tweeted : “ Surely , you do n't need to be a JJ NNP believer to recognise the fakery . “ Its not a JJ NNP vs globe matter , its exposure of the fraud and mockery . This affects us all . ” Unfortunately the JJ NN NN is supported by JJ prominent celebrities such as raper B.o.B. , cricketer Freddie Flintoff and NBA star Kyrie Irving . The same NNS VBP NASA and other respected scientific bodies are perpetuating the “ globe hoax ” for their own ends . B.o. B challenged NASA last NN by pledging to send a satellite into NN to settle the debate . Thankfully the argument has RB been put to rest by the countless hours of NN footage , photos and astronaut trips to NN ."

Instead_RB ,_, it_PRP comes_VBZ at_IN you_PRP through_IN symbolism_NN …_: like_IN a_DT dark_JJ horse_NN ._.","Katy Perry ’s “ Dark Horse ” is a fun and colorful NN taking place in Ancient Egypt . However , behind the cartoonish style of the NN , viewers are exposed to a great deal of symbolism of the occult elite and messages regarding its power . We ’ll look at the symbolism of “ Dark Horse ” . Katy Perry is a gigantic pop star , mainly because her songs and videos appeal to teens and pre-teens while her NN - appeal captures the attention of the older crowd . This makes her a perfect tool to be used by the elite to communicate its messages and , as seen in previous articles about her , her songs and videos are fully used for that purpose . Dark Horse , however , is on a whole other level . It is pure , relentless , in - your - face Illuminati symbolism , interlaced with references to the elite ’s brand of black magic and mind NN . Playing the role of “ Katy - Patra ” , an Egyptian pharaoh reminiscent of ancient NN symbol Cleopatra , Katy Perry rules over her subjects the same NN the occult elite rules over the NN . In my article on the 2014 Grammy Awards , I described Katy Perry ’s performance of Dark Horse as a black magick ritual disguised as a music performance . The NN goes straight to the roots of this sorcery : Egyptian Black Magick , the original source that is tapped into by today ’s dark secret societies . Before we look at the actual NN , let ’s look at its trailer , which contains a few interesting elements . Then the trailer VBZ that Kings MD travel from “ Brooklyn to Babylon ” to meet her . Babylon , which was a real ancient metropolis located where Iraq is today , was ruled by various ancient empires and has RB been an epicenter of the elite ’s black magic . Let ’s look at the NN . Dark Horse takes place in a colorful , NN - friendly version of Ancient Egypt that ’s been “ hip - hop- ized ” about 15 % to appeal to its target audience . Katy Perry plays the role of an evil , greedy , egotistical , despotic pharaoh named Katy - Patra who destroys men for their belongings . What a great lesson for girls under the age of 14 . In a wider sense , Katy - Patra ’s rule represents the occult elite taking resources and power from nations ( represented by the kings ) . What a great lesson for the rest of the NN . Throughout the NN , it is firmly established that Katy - Patra is an evil tyrant using black magic to VB and destroy NNS while having a bunch of kitten slaves at her NNS . Kind of IN what the occult elite does . And of course , there are all kinds of blatant symbols that show her to be a representative of the Illuminati . The above scenes tell plenty about the occult - elite influenced mythology of the NN . Katy - Patra is looked upon by Anubis , the jackal - headed NN of death , probably because she likes to kill NNS . Behind her is the falcon - headed NN Horus wearing gold chains ( to make him look “ cool ” to young , impressionable viewers ) . Notice that he only has CD eye – a reference , once again , to the All - Seeing Eye of Horus . More importantly , Katy - Patra is surrounded by a golden snake , which probably refers to the evil Egyptian NN Apep . Three 6 Mafia rapper Juicy J makes an appearance in the NN and his entrance is pretty darn symbolic too . He literally emerges from some kind sarcophagus , which features the occult elite ’s favorite symbol in lieu of eyes : The Eye of Horus inside a triangle . On top of all of that symbolism , we must never forget another part of the Agenda : Exposing young NNS to hyper - sexualization . The NN is essentially about kings from other nations trying to wow Katy - Patra with amazing gifts . The JJ suitor offers her a gigantic diamond . Katy - Patra immediately orders her kitten slaves to snatch that diamond from the suitor . The above image is symbolic for a few reasons : RB , it tells the viewers that Katy - Patra plays the role of the occult elite in the NN . Second , she CANNOT VB through the Eye ( it is opaque ) . She instead sees the diamond through the elite ’s “ eyes ” , which are focused on greed , power , and material possessions . Finally , NNS who watch music videos need to be exposed to that CD - eye sign all the NN . I MD stop the NN analysis here . What else do you truly need to VB about the NN ? Katy Perry is looking at a big diamond using an Eye of Horus to hide CD eye . This scene is a 100 % continuation of about everything I ’ve ever talked about on this site . And there it is again , RB in our faces , in CD of the NN ’s most popular videos . Really , how can anyone VB that all this symbolism is “ just a coincidence ” ? Anyhow , RB to the NN . The next suitor tries to entice Katy - Patra ’s gluttony by offering her food . Of course , things do not turn out great for that guy , either . The last suitor brings what Katy - Patra really wants : Power . Seeing this pyramid , Katy - Patra gets very excited because that ’s what she , and the elite , truly wants : Unlimited occult power over the NN . The illuminated pyramid essentially represents the Illuminati ’s high - tech NN over the NN . When Katy - Patra steps on top of the unfinished pyramid , she becomes imbued with crazy magical powers . She RB grows wings . The NN ends with Katy - Patra becoming a super - Illuminati pharaoh … and everyone bows down to her … and the suitor turns into a chihuahua . The moral of the NN ? Illuminati . It is rather hard to VB that all of this Illuminati symbolism was packed into a NN that only lasts 3 minutes and 40 seconds . It is RB harder to VB that some NNS still cannot VB the obvious pattern of symbols VBN in mass NN that transcends artists , music genres , and RB NN outlets . Far from being random , these symbols have been used for centuries to represent the occult elite and they are now all over the place . More than just flashing symbols , the NN Dark Horse tells a darker NN : the occult elite ’s insatiable greed for ultimate power while dismissing the petty rulers operating underneath it . Katy - Patra indeed takes resources from various kings of the NN and then destroys them . In the end , she climbs on an Illuminati pyramid and turns into an unstoppable pharaoh imbued with magical powers . MD the brainwashing be more obvious ? In short , Dark Horse is Illuminati propaganda aimed at NNS , using bright colors and catchy hooks to subliminally teach them who rules the NN and who controls the idols that they love and emulate . Of course , none of this is clearly spelled out . Instead , it comes at you through symbolism … IN a dark horse ."

But not any more . The hotel is hosting the second annual NNP NNP International Conference – an event that Davidson himself founded and organized . “ I ’d RB heard it in the Bible and thought ‘ this ca n’t be true , ’ ” he recalled , speaking with rapid excitement . “ I mean , I believed everything else , that the NNP was created in six literal days , but what about all this other stuff [ about a JJ NNP ] ? To be consistent as a biblical literalist , I ca n’t pick and choose . ” David ’s conversion to believing in a JJ NN was only a few NNS ago , yet in that NN he and scores of others around the globe – including a few celebrities – have subscribed to the idea that the NNP is shaped IN a pancake . The theories splinter off from there , with varying ideas about who is propagating misinformation about the NNP ’s shape and why , but there are a number of unifying touchstones : Nasa , Freemasons , the “ faked ” moon landing , globalists , Elon Musk . But perhaps the most common thread is the Bible , and the conviction of its fundamental NN . That makes evangelical Christians CD of largest and most enthusiastic groups who embrace the NN , but they are RB CD of the least reported on and CD that causes immense controversy in their own community . Yet walking the halls of the conference – where 650 NNS from around the NN paid up to $ 350 to attend lectures about their horizontal idea of the planet – it ’s not uncommon to VB NNS praying over CD another , discussing apocalyptic theories about “ end times ” , or swapping Bible verses that describe the NNP in a non-spherical fashion . “ I ’ve VBN over 200 scriptures that corroborate the idea that we are living on a stationary , JJ NNP , ” VBD Nathan Roberts , CD of JJ “ cosmological evangelists ” speaking at the event . He ’s a handsome , young entrepreneur , traveling the country with his wife and kids , speaking about Jesus and selling books about creationism – the perfect model of an American evangelical . And yet most evangelicals , IN most NNS , despise the work that he does on a JJ NNP . “ The most persecution I ’ve faced has been from within the church , ” Roberts VBD . At a NN when evangelicals are facing somewhat of a public relations crisis–backlash against their LGBT stance , prosperity doctrines and overwhelming support of the NNP 2016 NN , observers say it makes sense they MD bristle at any associations with the JJ NNP movement . Throughout the last century , evangelicals have had a love - hate relationship with fundamentalist Christians , who are an evangelical subculture who VBP the Bible as a historical , scientifically factual account of NN events . Mainstream evangelicals tend to employ what ’s VBN as “ seeker sensitive ” tactics of neutral politics , live rock music and charming , hip pastors , attracting celebrities IN Chris Pratt , Justin Bieber and Kim Kardashian . Whereas fundamentalist Christians are typically less frills and more idealism , often leading to homeschooling , survivalist lifestyles , and a focus on the Book of Revelation . JJ Earthers ( or “ biblical Earthers , ” as some distinguish themselves at this conference ) are a JJ subculture of American fundamentalist Christianity . It ’s a marriage of anti-government NN theories ( Nasa ’s NN program is a complete lie ) with biblical literalism ( the NNP is the JJ , center of the universe , with heaven above the sky and hell below the ground ) . The movement does claim a few celebrities . In 2007 The View co-host and evangelical Christian Sherri Shepherd caused a collective gasp in the early NN of JJ NN when she publicly questioned whether the NNP was JJ . Former MTV diva Tila Tequila , rapper B.o.B. , and Boston Celtics Kyrie Irving have all publicly identified as JJ Earthers . At Thursday ’s conference , Davidson was giddy to announce the unexpected appearance of the NNP personality Logan Paul ( whose channel has more than 18 million subscribers ) . Paul made a brief appearance on stage , where he announced he was “ coming out of the JJ NNP closet ” to a thunderous applause from the crowd . Their increase in relevance is primarily due to JJ NN and an endlessly curious NN . The Washington Post , for example , has run six separate articles about an amateur rocketeer attempting to kiss the sky and NN - record that the NN is JJ . But for the most part , JJ Earthers are CD of the most mocked subcultures of our NN . They have inspired the ire of Neil deGrasse Tyson , Modern Family and an evangelical scholar whose work they have cited as evidence for their NN . “ They ’ve taken my writing about ancient Israelite cosmology , interpreted it in this uber - literal NN , and used it to prop up this JJ NNP idea , ” VBD Michael Heiser , a biblical scholar from Liberty NNP and host of The Naked Bible podcast , who has expressed his frustration with the misinterpretation of his work by JJ Earthers . IN most debates between scholars and fundamentalists , his gripe with JJ Earthers comes down to whether the Bible should be seen as an allegorical or literal text . “ In Genesis , you have an NNP that is round but JJ , with a solid dome over it , ” VBZ Heiser . “ In Proverbs , there are references to the seas being held in place where light meets darkness , which is the horizon , where the dome covers and seals the NNP . You have references to the NNP being set upon a foundation , VBN as the pillars of the NNP . You have waters beneath the NNP , which is the realm of the dead . “ All of this is standard vocabulary for how NNS of this NN and place viewed the NN . They did n’t VB about Antarctica or NNP Zealand . The Bible is an ancient Mediterranean - centered document , written by NNS who are describing their NN through their experiences . The mountains are described as holding the dome of the sky in place , but there was no REI store nearby where they MD buy mountain climbing gear and scale these peaks to VB what was VBG on . ” Heiser is a Christian himself , albeit CD who prefers to view the Bible in its historical context . JJ NNS at the conference , including Davidson , say they have been kicked out of churches , or lost jobs with churches , or suffered broken relationships with family members because they have gone public with their beliefs about a JJ NNP . They VBP the Denver conference as a rare opportunity to share a physical NN with fellow believers . “ It ’s very cathartic being around other [ JJ Earthers ] , ” VBD Davidson . “ It ’s so important , because we ’ve been isolated and abused , and now we can breathe , relate and connect with JJ - minded NNS … I ’d say only 20 % of JJ Earthers are actually out of the closet about this . What you VBP now is just the JJ wave . There ’s a bigger wave coming and it ’s gonna catch the NN off guard . ”"

But Troetel , who is 32 and lives in Boulder , Colorado , is not particularly interested in the Colts . Addai ’s performance is crucial to “ Addai in the NNP , ” Troetel ’s fantasy football team . Fantasy sports , where fans select real athletes for make - VBP teams , are exploding onto JJ platforms IN smart phones and JJ networking sites , grabbing the attention of advertisers , wireless carriers and software NNS . And with a growing number of NNS playing casual games on the Internet and a largely untapped market outside the NNP NNPS , analysts say the market for fantasy sports can only grow . Among NNS benefiting from this growth is 4 I nfo , which alerts its users to things IN sports scores and celebrity gossip via text message , with its revenue coming from advertisers . Of the half a billion text messages that 4 I n fo expects to send this NN , as JJ as 15 percent will be to NNS seeking sports results to feed into their fantasy sports teams , VBD CEO Zaw Thet . “ NNS have yet to realize the full potential of fantasy as it really comes to the cell phone and we ’ll VB that over the course of the next several NNS , ” VBD Thet , whose NN is backed by Gannett Co , General Electric Co ’s NBC Universal and venture capital firms . While there is disagreement on the origin of fantasy sports , they came to wide attention with the publication of “ Rotisserie League Baseball ” in 1984 , based on a league played by a group of NNP York NN types and rules by magazine writer Daniel Okrent . The appeal of fantasy leagues to sports fanatics is often cited as a factor in the early success of USA Today , which was launched in 1982 with more detailed baseball statistics than other newspapers . “ It ’s IN you ’ve combined the old macho notion of knowing more than anybody about sports with Dungeons and Dragons , ” VBD Robert Thompson , professor of pop culture at Syracuse NNP . “ It turns out that ’s a pretty good marriage . ” Troetel , for example , checks on his players at least CD or three times a week , using his handheld device to VB to the relevant websites . “ The NN I VBP sports now is far and away greater than if I did n’t play fantasy sports , ” he VBD . Fantasy sports took an exponential leap in the late 1990s as the Internet made sports results more widely available and sites IN Yahoo Inc began to host fantasy sports leagues for a fee . There are now more than 27 million players in the NNP NNPS and annual revenue is in the range of $ 800 million to $ 1 billion , according to the Fantasy Sports Trade Association . Fans already use their mobile phones to read sports NN , review game scores and check on their teams . Wireless carriers are now working to align themselves exclusively with whatever sports properties they can as a NN to make themselves more attractive to consumers . “ If you ’re the only NN who offers what NNS VBP , they ’re VBG to find a NN to switch to your service , ” VBD Steve Gaffney , director of sports and entertainment marketing for Sprint Nextel Corp , which has deals with the National Football League and the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing ( NASCAR ) . While small screens are not that attractive to advertisers , smart phones IN NNP in Motion ’s Blackberry and Apple ’s iPhone that offer live streaming NN and other multimedia features is undeniable , VBD Bob Bowman , chief executive of Major League Baseball ’s advanced NN unit . Another growth area is JJ networking sites IN NNP , which is hosting a fantasy football game with 350,000 users since it started in July , making it CD of the larger fantasy football games on the Internet . “ Fantasy sports at its core is a set of microcommunities of your good friends that you VBP to stay in touch with and ‘ talk smack ’ to , and NNP allows NNS to do that , ” VBD Jeff Ma , co-founder of Citizen Sports Network , which runs the NNP game in partnership with NNP Warner ’s Sports Illustrated . Ma , whose San Francisco - based firm is backed by venture capitalists Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers , is the basis for the main character in the book “ Bringing Down the House ” and the movie “ 21 , ” in which a group of students used math to win millions of dollars from casinos . Another big growth area for fantasy sports is among so - called casual gamers , those whose interest is limited or who MD not have a lot of free NN to play . ESPN , a unit of Walt Disney Co , in late August introduced a game where users try to select winners and top performers in an effort to be JJ to build a 25 - pick winning streak over four months that MD net a $ 1 million prize . “ It ’s our strategy to develop games that are very easy to play , ” VBD Raphael Poplock , vice NN of games for ESPN Digital NN . These casual players MD VB almost double the number of fantasy sports players to 50 million over the next five NNS , VBD Chris Russo , CEO of Fantasy Sports Ventures , a NN NN focused on fantasy sports . Other NNS taking advantage of the growth in fantasy sports include Google ’s NNP , Electronic Arts and advertisers IN Gillette and Coke . “ The sheer participation numbers are so overwhelming , ” VBD Andrew Bangs , a community marketing specialist with NNP , which launched a fantasy football channel in July . The growth in fantasy sports is RB feeding RB into the real sports leagues , where fantasy sports fans spend more NN engaged with real teams than fans who do n’t play fantasy sports . “ Nearly 60 percent of revenue comes from fans attending games , so to the extent I can VB a casual fan to VB to CD game that means a lot , ” baseball ’s Bowman VBD . “ If I can repeat that 10 million times , that ’s real money . ” Overseas markets offer another enticing opportunity , as games around cricket , soccer , rugby and other sports are not as developed as those in the NNP NNPS , VBD Steve Byrd , executive vice NN with Stats Inc , which licenses sports content and statistics for almost 90 different sports leagues . “ You VBP the growing middle class in China and India , with Internet access , they ’re VBG to VB to engage with their sports the NN that we do , ” he VBD . In addition , industry executives VBD the number of fantasy websites is exploding . That expansion will only speed up since the U.S. Supreme Court in June declined to hear the appeal by Major League Baseball of a lower - court ruling that any NN has the free - speech NN to use the names and performance statistics of famous athletes . Of course with so JJ NNS out there , there is bound to be a shakeout . “ CD out of every 10 sites makes it , ” VBD Rick Wolf , chairman of the Fantasy Sports Association . “ For the small NNS , it ’s very hard to succeed . ” Not everyone is in favor of fantasy sports . “ I am the JJ - NN society on this NN , ” VBD Dave Zirin , sports writer for The Nation , a left - wing magazine . “ It ’s a very atomizing experience to live in the NNP NNPS at times and so sports is CD of those few ways where we ’re able to VB a sense of collective joy . Fantasy sports runs counter to that . ” Allison Lodish just wants her husband RB . She launched Women Against Fantasy Sports ( http://womenagainstfantasysports.com) in August as a forum for frustrated spouses . The site ’s top - selling item is women ’s underwear with the slogan : “ Closed for the fantasy season . ”"

But why are waves on the West Coast bigger than those on the East Coast ? There are three primary factors that determine a wave 's height : According to the Encyclopedia of the NNP , a wave is "" the oscillations of the NN caused by the wind blowing along the NN and moving in the direction in which the wind blows . "" The important thing to remember about waves is that the NN is n't moving -- the NN from the wind is moving through the NN . On the West Coast , the prevailing winds are behind the waves , which increases the waves ' NN . On the East Coast , the prevailing winds blow against the incoming waves , decreasing the waves ' NN . ­ ­On each coast of the NNP NNPS is a continental shelf . To understand the continental shelf , let 's imagine that the NN dried up . The land under the NN looks a bit IN the Grand Canyon , with cliffs and valleys , plateaus and ridges . On the West Coast , if you walked out onto the continental shelf , you MD notice that the shelf ( the area between the beach and where the drop - off begins ) is narrower . This means that if you have less sand to walk on before the NN 's floor drops off steeply , IN a cliff . On the East Coast , the shelf is broader -- there is more sand to walk on as the shelf drops gradually , IN a really JJ ramp . Underneath the NN of the NN , particles are spinning in the direction that the wind is moving in . The particles are largest at the NN of the NN . The deeper you VBP in the NN , the smaller the spinning particles . As the wave moves inland and hits the upward slope of the continental shelf on the East Coast , the friction causes the particles to slow down , so the wave gradually collapses on itself . On the West Coast , the shelf rises suddenly near the coast , so the waves are much larger when they crash into the coastline -- the particles ( and thus the wave ) have n't been slowed down by extended friction with the shelf . The Pacific NNP on the West Coast has a greater expanse than the Atlantic NNP on the East Coast . This means that the fetch ( the distance over which the wind blows ) is greater on the West Coast than on the East Coast . In this case , you can VB of wave as a snowball : The farther you roll your snowball along in the snow , the bigger it gets . West - coast waves tend to start RB out in the Pacific NNP , so they have a greater distance to travel before they hit the shore -- more NN to grow in size and length . Dr. Ernie Knowles , associate professor of oceanography at NC NNP NNP , can VB us put all of this together : "" The steep shelf on the West Coast MD VB a more abrupt buildup of the shoaling wave ( so waves MD be ' steeper ' when they break ) . But the much longer fetch in the Pacific NNP allows the waves to receive more wind NN , and so they grow larger . The swell arriving on the West Coast has periods in the range of 10 to 17 seconds ( quite JJ waves ) , while the East Coast swell is more in the six - to 10 - second range .

The England cricket legend , 42 , once revealed he was hooked on a podcast called The NNP Earthers . In 2017 , Flintoff revealed he believes the NNP is not perfectly spherical - but has now taken it a step further by calling it turnip - shaped . When asked about his NNP NNP comments , "" Freddie "" - speaking to Laura Woods on talkSPORT - revealed : "" It 's more IN a JJ turnip ... "" I 'm not saying it 's IN a pancake , I 've never VBN that . "" I 'm saying it 's slightly round , but not your perfect sphere . "" NNS VBP I 'm daft , but if you VBP about it , there 's this thing called gravity that we 're sticking to the NN in ... "" If you VBP about that in the cold light of day , it 's bonkers is n't it ? It is bonkers . "" Imagine being in Australia , you 're upside down ... all the NN MD rush to your head . It MD be a nightmare . "" The 2005 Ashes hero admitted to his JJ obsession , the The NNP Earthers podcast . The show involves NN theorists who are adamant the NN is JJ - and who RB accuse Disney of peddling lies about the planet ’s shape . At the NN , Flintoff insisted there was “ evidence to suggest the NN is n’t round ” . He added : “ If you ’re in a helicopter and you hover why does the NNP not come to you if it ’s round ? “ Why , if we ’re hurtling through NN , why MD NN stay still ? Why is it not wobbling ? "" RB if you fire a laser about 16 miles , if the NN was curved , you should n’t be able to VB it but you can . ” But once again he admitted he does not VB NNP is totally JJ , instead claiming it was “ bulbous , IN a turnip ” . He VBD : “ The middle is the North Pole , around the outside is the South Pole which is IN a big wall of NN . "" This is why all governments now have bases on the South Pole . ” Other sporting stars who VBP the NN is not round include NBA star Kyrie Irving and wrestler AJ Styles .

They are highly advanced in technology , and call the main ship , the Mother Ship – “ Mama ” . We call NNP “ Mother ” . The Mother ship allowed itself to be attacked by the “ reptilians ” , in order to trigger a “ coming together in unity ” of the various other galactics : Arcturians were RB , then others . They were trained to VB with the rebuilding , as a pretext to creating a common goal : uniting against the “ evil enemy ” , and assisting NN ’s peoples . The NN is a metaphor for Christ , having “ laid down his NN ” for our sins . Sacrifice . The Mother Ship allowed herself to be attacked by the reptilians , with a larger plan of bringing together other galactics into unity . The Sirians decide they cannot contact us directly , as it MD be “ too disturbing ” . So , the Mother ship is building , in her “ storage hold ” , at the bottom , a JJ “ baby ship ” , while a team effort is made to repair her NN , atom by atom . It will be the focus of all the different galactic groups , who are / will be attempting to communicate with us via holographic technologies . She is calling forth an etheric partner , to mate with , and the little ship in her womb is VBG to literally “ be birthed ” . Where have we heard this NN before ?! Over and over and over …new clothes , same old broken record . Sirius B is allegedly the Dogon tribe and is called Satais : Satan ? Saturn ? And Sirius C has “ penis envy problems ” , since it ’s so “ tiny ” , and insignificant . Name ? ANU . You can figure out the rest . VB the Lessin ’s work on the ANUnnaki . Giving them some credit , no race is good or bad . IN us , there are wise ones and savage selfish ones , a “ mixed bag ” . The problem with “ Ascended Masters ” in any guise , is complacency and a desire to rule over , not create with . In a fully ascended society or group , there MD be no thought forms of killing , envy , using others , rape , wars , etc . Those are all from the 9D underworld , the Matrix , from which we are individually being guided to “ the door ” out . We have become “ Creators ” at the material - matter level , which is something the “ advanced ones ” lack . They do not have the comprehension , or the necessary empathy and love for all things in creation , RB a bug . They are so mired in technology that it ’s IN another trap , similar to here , the “ earthly maze ” . This is a place of unending illusions – nothing creating nothing real , it ’s all false . Only our truest emotions and higher NNS of consciousness are IN pearls , that VBP placed on a strand with a knot between each NN , “ in case ” the strand ( DNA ) breaks . Ours has been heavily tampered with , yet here we are ! Eventually , Sirius A view their technology as a great gift to us . Hidden devices , behind our speakers , will “ create feelings at the emotional level ” , thoroughly “ blissing us out ” , we will be in a kind of virtual dream NN that ’s forever peaceful . Question : where are all the living things …trees , wind , NN , fire , NN , oceans , etc . ? They are not there . What happened to Gaia - Sophia ? Not there . It appears to be yet another carrot , being dangled , to subdue “ the monstrous humans ” , that cannot RB be dealt with in person , we are so savage . There is no mention of Pleiadian or other involvement , so this is a serious Sirius A problem ! There is always a “ bad guy ” … those evil … “ x , y’s and z’x ” , be they this , that or another . Lucifer and Satan are very popular , reptilians are out , Archons in , A.I. is here now , and the demigods … those pesky interlopers . I vaguely remember Sirius A and B both ascended , and C did n’t make it , and is “ Planet X ” , feeding off of NN ’s NN , mostly on our JJ divinity being kept repressed . Religions collapse when we step up to the plate ! Politics , corporations , NNS , all collapse , IN a wave collapsing into Zero Point , so they all have a lot invested in keeping us ignorant and savage . The plan showed in this NN is a clear message about “ overwriting ” CD of the Creators , perhaps the head honcho , that created our multi-verse . Perhaps , “ it ” is US . As RB as we ’re fragmented , and not in CD piece , or unified , which is the idea here , our “ powers ” remain hidden within , until we VBP within to find our own truths , while knowing that the projection “ out there ” is Maya , illusion . It can only create more of itself , more illusions … It ’s quite possible that “ ascension ” is not UH a ladder VBG up , a la Jacob , but is an inner descent through the 9D Underworlds , where we are now at 3D , VBG into 2D ( Telluric / crystalline ) , 1D ( Core / Heart ) , to be birthed in ZERO POINT or “ no NN ” , Graduation ! That is the process of i n c e n s i o n , which has nothing to do with the JJ hologram we ’re obsessed with . That is the “ earthly maze ” . It ’s collapsing as we speak … “ JJ NN NNS ” , the “ sun is a “ microchip ” that ’s VBG to stop working , thrusting our universe into a short period of blissful darkness , not light . Those who panic , unable to VB “ centered ” , will find that location quite difficult to navigate . It requires the ability to endure silence , and who today can stand more than half an hour of complete silence ? We ’re constantly busy busy busy , with CD flashing glint of “ fool ’s gold ” after another ! Meher Baba drew a circle within a circle , representing the “ Original Real Everything ” and a smaller dotted circle , “ Original Real Nothing ” . Dotted lines come out of the shadow , ( nothing ) , to create the “ False Everything ” , with its “ innumerable nothings ” . This is a false creation , which will continue to create more of itself , until we wake up , snap out of it , and “ grok ” that we are part of the Original Real Everything . The “ shadow ” dissolves , or becomes smaller , as we each awaken to our own inner truths , and VBP that we are “ Gods in our own universe ” . Our power is being milked and diverted , by the “ False Everything ” . It will do anything to remain unseen , Unconscious and pulling the strings , IN a Puppet Master . IN the film , The Truman Show , his is a metaphor for our own sticky wicket here . That ’s a lower – bottom of the fish bowl frequency , of scum . It can not make it through any shifts , created authentically . We ’d be in another cycle of incarnation , only they MD do away with the “ death ” , to some NN ’s glee , until that “ perfect NN ” became TOO perfect . Boredom sets in , then you have “ disaster groupies ” , who travel into the past , to watch NN ’s and other planet ’s , huge disasters . The film , Disaster in NNP [ aka Timescape ( 1992 ) ] foreshadows this beautifully , and it ’s CD of my favorite films . I VBP we need to educate these “ higher beings ” , and let them VB they MD have the best of intentions , most likely not , and that we are capable of communing and creation from our own thoughts , being creators with amnesia . I prefer not to remain in a coma , but MD rather WAKE UP , be responsible for my creations , and enjoy the harmony of friends who resonate , have chosen a path of peace , love , joy and fun ! Where is the humor ? The “ humans ” seem to be floating around in a daze , just dreaming . Sorry , it ’s got some fatal flaws ! I have no intention of permitting nanotechnology , artificial “ mood enhancers all around me , beaming “ feel good bliss ” as you approach them , to be MY NN ! Still , there are some great visuals and it offers a PERSPECTIVE , a point of view , but it ’s very controlled and highly suggestive and is loaded with “ propaganda ” . But , we ’re accustomed to having others VB for us , so it ’s a familiar place for most to be . Someone is VBG to save us …the running “ Savior Program ” , A.I . The Architects try to remove LOVE from the equation , and they continue to have to destroy their creations . They ca n’t survive without true love , felt by a “ heart NN ” , the Higher Emotional Center . When it is active , along with Higher Intellectual Center , it activates the third part of the equation , the trinity within : non-dual , transcendent , infinite and eternal ."

Appearing online in a NNP NN posted on the StarTalk channel , Mr Tyson vented his outrage and debunked the NNP NNP myth . Unamused by his co-host Chuck Nice ’s question about the shape of the NNP , the vexed scientist VBD : “ We have NN from NN of the rotating , spherical NNP . The NNP is round . ” The NNP NNP NN is an old and obviously debunked belief the NN is not spherical , but rather a JJ disk surround by a towering barrier of NN . Believers of the bunkum NN , commonly referred to as NNP Earthers , claim to rely on their own senses and observations rather than empirical scientific data . JJ JJ Earthers have accused leading scientific bodies IN NASA of deceiving the public about NNP ’s shape . But Mr Tyson now expressed his confusion when faced with the number of NNS who still subscribe to the NN . The physicist VBD : “ What is odd , is there are NNS who VBP NNP is JJ but recognise that the Moon is round , Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , Neptune and the sun are all spheres . He then went on to explain why the vast majority of stellar objects in the observable universe are all round , and only occasionally appear to be flattened . According to Mr Tyson all the VBN laws of physics and processes in NN “ favour the sphere ” . He VBD : “ And if something is not a sphere and is a little flattened , you can ask what flattened it , and you find out it ’s rotating real fast . “ So then it gets a little flattened because of that . So almost everything in the universe is either a sphere or light distortion of a sphere , for some other things happening to it . “ We can just VB how the universe favours spheres . ” But then why do so JJ NNS still VB the NN is JJ ? A lot of it comes down to the fundamental problems with free speech , Mr Tyson argued . Mr Tyson blamed the scores of NNS who truly VBP the NNP is JJ and spout their false theories to others without consequence . The physicist RB criticised the American schooling system , saying it does not teach NNS to VB critically . He VBD : “ Our system needs to train you not only what to VB , but how to VB about NN and knowledge and evidence . “ If you do n’t have that kind of training you MD run around and VB anything . ” The NNP NNP Society claims to encourage the spread of ideas and free thought since at least 1865 ."

On Jan. 25th 2019 , Google owned - NNP announced on its official blog that it ’s VBG to stop recommending “ borderline content ” to its users and viewers – presumably because it deeply cares . Hmm-hmm . NNP VBZ that such content “ MD misinform users in harmful ways . ” JJ NNS have awoken to the NN of the NWO ( NNP NNP Order ) and JJ aspects of the overarching NN by watching NNP videos over the NNS , including by letting NNP guide them to JJ videos through its recommendation algorithm . Now the free flow of NN is about to stymied once again , and as with all things related to the NWO Agenda , this will be another step of JJ to come , since Google serves the Agenda . NNP has yet to fully detail what it means by borderline content , although interestingly enough , it has divulged 3 examples of what it has in mind : “ We ’ll continue that work this NN , including taking a closer look at how we can reduce the spread of content that comes close to — but does n’t quite cross the line of — violating our Community Guidelines . “ To that end , we ’ll begin reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that MD misinform users in harmful ways — such as videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness , claiming the NN is JJ , or making blatantly false claims about historic events IN 9/11 . ” Whatever Google is VBG after is a barometer of what the NWO manipulators most do n’t VB you to VB . Natural cures are a big threat to the profits and monopoly of Big Pharma . They are RB threat to those at the peak of the NN pyramid , because a fit , healthy and strong populace is far harder to VB than a dependent , sick and weak NN . Of course , there are JJ charlatans in the natural NN NN ( just as in the Western medical NN ) who will exaggerate , lie and claim anything just to make a sale , so Google is using this as NN to garner more support for its censorship efforts . This will have the unfortunate effect of burying videos that truly teach natural cures to NN . There are so JJ examples of budding , promising or proven natural cures to diseases that Big Pharma has tried to suppress . Just look at cancer alone – natural treatments such as vitamin B17 ( laetrile / amygdalin ) , Rife frequency machines , baking soda , the Gerson Therapy , the Budwig Diet , graviola and JJ more are all not sanctioned by NN authorities despite the evidence supporting them . Far from protecting its users , NNP is about to do more harm to by curbing the free flow of NN to prevent more NNS from seeing alternative cures and possibly trying them out , or at least having the opportunity and freedom to make up their own minds . Is NNP VBG to stop NNS knowing about the power of medicinal cannabis ? Or C60 ? Organic fruit and vegetables ? Is it VBG to try to shut down discourse on the true meaning of healing vs. managing NN ? NNS in the alternative NN community are still divided on the issue of NNP NNP ( FE ) , although the JJ majority VBP it is either a psy - op or a delusion . Regardless of what turns out to be true , however , the fact cannot be denied that JJ NNP NNP videos are raising important questions that standard mainstream physics does n’t appear to have answers for . If it turns out that all the questions and doubt can be adequately answered and countered by the existing heliocentric model , then good ; the FE movement will have done heliocentrism a favor by challenging it and making it stronger . This is precisely why no advanced society need fear freedom of speech , asking questions , investigating topics or being curious . There is no such thing as a dumb question . All questions VBP clarify our understanding . Harm only comes by suppressing questions , not by answering them . Given Google ’s penchant for promoting the NWO agenda ( e.g. Project Dragonfly , Project Maven , the Selfish Ledger and the Good Censor ) , I consider it highly significant that NNP is VBG after the NNP NNP Movement . Curious researchers MD do well to ask themselves : what is Google worried that you will find out by investigating the nature of the planet on which you live ? MD it be this ? Physicist Explains Why We Live In A Virtual Reality The “ majority ” is never a good test of the truthhood of something , however RB in this case , Google does n’t have the majority on its side . An April 2016 Rasmussen poll VBD that “ Americans doubt they ’ve been VBN all the facts about the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the NNP NNPS and strongly VBP the NN should come clean . ” With all the lies , deceit and holes in the official 9/11 narrative , including the JJ role of Israel in the attacks , shielding NNS from knowing the NN is far more harmful than saving NNS from questioning the NN and thinking for themselves . 9/11 NN is a good barometer to measure how much someone has woken up to the NN of how our NN is run . The good NN is that NNS are waking up in greater numbers than ever before . Thus , NNP wo n’t have the public support it might VB it will be trying to bury these topics . Who ’s Done More Harm – Free Thinkers or the MSM ? Google - Owned NNP claims it is embarking on this JJ phase of censorship ( or better put thought NN and perception NN ) to minimize the “ harm ” to its viewers , yet this is grossly hypocritical . NNP has been caught NN and again censoring alternative and independent NN while allowing NN abuse , soft porn and other sorts of content on its platform . Additionally , NNP protects the MSM dinosaur NN ( and its dwindling profits ) when the MSM has consistently lied through its teeth to an unsuspecting public . The MSM has done tremendous “ harm ” by pushing lies to start wars ( e.g. the JJ Gulf War in 1991 or the Iraq War in 2003 ) , by parroting the official line in false flag ops and by promoting governmental propaganda such as the 2008 Stimulus / Bailout which robbed the American taxpayer to pay Wall St . That is all on a more superficial level . On a deeper level , YT is pushing forward the censorship agenda of the NWO . It ’s not ultimately about money or insider industries helping other insider industries . It ’s about perception NN . The self - appointed censors have come up with all sorts of excuses for this censorship , such as hate speech , JJ NN and borderline content . If we continue to allow this trend , the NN freaks at the top of the power pyramid will undoubtedly conjure up any more phrases in the future to achieve their goal of total NN NN . I can VB of some possibilities they might try : “ harmful content ” , “ false NN ” , “ disallowed speech ” , “ forbidden writing ” , “ unsanctioned words , ” and on and on it will VB . For instance , USA Today VBZ YT will employ 10,000 NNS to hunt for “ offensive ” videos . If this is coming directly from Google , then the game has already changed from “ harmful content ” to “ offensive videos . ” Where will it end ? There will be a thousand reasons proffered to squelch free speech , however no matter how JJ are proposed , and no matter how good the intentions , they always overlook the point that the self - appointed rulers and censors cannot ever VB enough to judge what it is true or false . This is of course not to mention the thousand ways rulers become corrupted and find it in their own interest to suppress , obfuscate and cover up . Conclusion : NNS Must VB for Themselves if a Society is to Be Free In a free society , NNS must educate themselves to learn the difference between the hucksters and the genuine ones , so that it does n’t matter who speaks , because each person can make up their own mind . It does n’t matter what civilization , what culture or what era you are in , the principle will remain the same . The only NN we can progress as a society is to have open discourse , debate and discussion . We have to trust that NNS are wise enough and mature enough to digest NN and make up their own minds as to the veracity and usefulness of it . If NNS are not , then as a society we need to focus our efforts on education to raise NNS to that level . In such a society , the NNS MD ultimately VB anything false , inflammatory , manipulative , limiting and / or useless for what it is . If you ’re looking for solutions to combat censorship , consider using platforms such as Minds.com and D.Tube who have decentralization , non-censorship and freedom of speech written into their code ."

When the tide goes out along the beaches of the Dampier Peninsula today , it reveals thousands of their massive fossil footprints preserved in sandstone rock . Now , the region has revealed an extraordinarily diverse array of dinosaur tracks along a single 25 - km ( 15.5 - mile ) stretch of the Daimler Peninsula . Thousands of fossil footprints left between 127 and 140 million NNS ago , including tracks from 21 different types of dinosaurs , line the beaches near Walmadany ( James Price Point ) . Some of the armored dino tracks belong to stegosaurus , and are the only confirmed evidence of that particular dinosaur in Australia . Not only that — among the tracks left by the enormous four - legged plant eaters VBN as sauropods ( a group that includes brachiosaurus and brontosaurus , among others ) was CD print measuring nearly 5 NNS 9 inches ( 1.75 meters ) JJ . It ’s believed to be the largest dino track ever recorded , topping the previous record of 1.15 meters ( or nearly 3 NNS 9 inches ) . NNS discovered that giant footprint , the largest VBN carnivorous dinosaur track , in Bolivia last July . “ There were five different types of predatory dinosaur tracks , at least six types of tracks from JJ - necked herbivorous sauropods , four types of tracks from CD - legged herbivorous ornithopods , and six types of tracks from armored dinosaurs , ” the lead archaeologist on the project , Steve Salisbury of the NNP of Queensland , VBD in a statement . “ It ’s such a magical place — Australia ’s own Jurassic Park , in a spectacular wilderness setting . ” Though Australia has JJ rocks old enough to contain dinosaur fossils , relatively few have been VBN on the continent . This is due to its predominantly low , JJ terrain , which makes exposed fossils vulnerable to erosion by the elements . Up until now , most of Australia ’s dino fossils have been VBN on the eastern side of the continent , and are considerably younger ( between 115 and 90 million NNS old ) . Local indigenous NNS in the Kimberley region have claimed the trackway as part of their oral history tradition , likely for thousands of NNS . As Salisbury explained to BBC NNP , the aborigines VBP the fossilized footprints as part of a creation myth based on a figure called Marala , the emu-man . “ Wherever [ Marala ] went , “ Salisbury VBD , “ he left behind three - toed tracks that now we recognize as the tracks of meat - eating dinosaurs . ” In fact , it was members of a local aboriginal community , the Goolarabooloo , who RB VBD the NNS it was there . In 2008 , after the Australian NN announced plans to build a liquid natural NN facility in the area , Goolarabooloo leaders asked Salisbury to document the beach tracks , hoping evidence of dinosaur fossils in the region MD lead the NN to stop the project . Between 2011 and 2016 , the team of paleontologists from Queensland NNP and James Cook NNP spent some 400 hours recording details of the tracks . Using a technique called 3 - D photogrammetry , they took pictures of the prints from different angles and used the images to build accurate models to measure and examine . They RB took silicone peels of JJ of the tracks , which can be used to make casts to display in museums . The researchers recently published their findings in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology . Meanwhile , development of the NN plant in the region was halted after project leaders concluded it was not economically feasible ."

If you neglect external forces IN wind , air resistance , or any other terrestrial objects , this parabolic shape describes how the center - of - mass of your object moves extremely accurately , no matter what it is or what else is at play . But under the laws of gravity , a parabola is an impossible shape for an object that 's gravitationally bound to the NNP . The math simply does n't work out . If we MD design a precise enough experiment , we 'd measure that projectiles on NNP make tiny deviations from the predicted parabolic path we all derived in class : microscopic on the scale of a NN , but still significant . Instead , objects thrown on NNP trace out an elliptical orbit similar to the Moon . Here 's the unexpected reason why . If you wanted to model the gravitational field at NNP 's NN , there are CD simplifying assumptions you MD make : • the NNP , at least in your vicinity , is JJ rather than curved , • and that NNP 's gravitational field points straight down relative to your current location . Any NN you throw and release an object , therefore , it enters a situation VBN as free - fall . In the directions that are parallel to the NNP 's NN ( horizontal ) , the speed of any projectile will remain constant . In the directions that are perpendicular to NNP 's NN ( vertical ) , however , your projectile will accelerate downwards at 9.8 m/s² : the acceleration due to gravity at NNP 's NN . If you make these assumptions , then the trajectory you calculate will always be a parabola , exactly what we 're taught in physics classes around the globe . But neither CD of these assumptions are true . The NNP MD appear JJ — so indistinguishable from JJ that we cannot detect it over the distances most projectiles cover — but the reality is that it has a spheroidal shape . RB over distances of just a few meters , the difference between a perfectly JJ NNP and a curved NNP comes into play at the 1 - part - in - 1,000,000 level . This approximation does n't matter so much for the trajectory of an individual projectile , but the second approximation does . From any location along its path , a projectile is n't truly accelerated "" straight down "" in the vertical direction , but towards the center of the NNP . Over the same distance of a few meters , the difference in angle between "" straight down "" and "" towards the center of the NNP "" RB comes into play at the 1 - part - in - 1,000,000 level , but this NN makes a difference . For a typical system , IN a kicked soccer ball , a thrown football , or RB a home run in baseball , the deviations from a parabola will show up at the level of tens to perhaps a hundred microns : smaller than a single paramecium . But the true trajectory is fascinating , and something derived by Johannes Kepler more than half a century before Newton came along . Just IN the Moon , any projectile traces out an elliptical orbit , with the center of the NNP as CD focus of that ellipse . The only difficulty for a projectile on NNP , as opposed to the Moon , is that the NNP itself gets in the NN . As a result , we only VBP CD tiny portion of the ellipse : the part that rises slightly above the NNP 's NN , reaches the peak of its trajectory ( VBN as aphelion in celestial mechanics ) , and then falls RB towards the NNP 's center . As soon as the NN of the NNP gets in the NN , however , the problem resets once again . If the projectile bounces at all , it will create an entirely JJ fragment - of - an - ellipse for its trajectory to follow , which can again be approximated very well by a parabola . This happens for a simple reason that we typically take for granted : the NNP is made out of the same type of stuff , normal matter , that a typical projectile is made out of . Normal matter , which typically consists of protons , neutrons , and electrons , do n't just experience the gravitational force , but nuclear and electromagnetic forces as well . It 's the electromagnetic force that causes the typical interactions we experience between particles , enabling elastic and inelastic collisions , and preventing our projectiles from simply slipping through the NNP . We can VB around this problem , however , by imagining that we had something that did n't interact with normal matter as our projectile . Perhaps it MD be a low - NN neutrino ; perhaps it MD be a clump of dark matter . In either case , this projectile , once we released it , MD only experience the gravitational force , and MD pass through the NN and interior of the NNP itself under only the force of gravity . If you expected that this particle MD make a closed ellipse , however , and MD return to its original location some ~ 90 minutes later RB above the NN of the NNP from where it was RB thrown , you 've gone and made another approximation that is n't quite JJ . When we calculate orbital trajectories , we treat the NNP as a single point : where all of its mass is located directly at its center . When we calculate trajectories of satellites , NN stations , and RB the Moon , this works just fine . But for a particle that passes through NNP 's NN , that approximation is no good any longer . As RB as you 're outside of a mass that 's shaped IN a sphere ( or spheroid ) , all of that mass gravitationally attracts you towards the center of the object . But if you 're only outside part of that mass ( and only part of it is closer to the center of the NN than you are ) , then all the parts of that mass that are outside of your present location cancel out . You can only feel the gravitational effect of the mass that lies interior to you , assuming that everything external to your position is spherically symmetric . In electromagnetism , this is a consequence of Gauss 's Law ; in gravitational physics , it 's a consequence of ( the related ) Birkhoff 's theorem . But what this practically means is that once you start falling through the NNP , you experience less and less of the internal mass 's gravitational pull . Rather than an ellipse , therefore , your trajectory MD slowly VB into a more oval , egg - JJ shape . As you passed through the less - dense crust and mantle and headed towards the inner and outer cores , you 'd notice that there were not only smooth NNS , but a few discontinuous "" kinks "" in the shape you traced out , corresponding to the various layers ( of varying densities ) in the NNP 's interior . You MD never re-emerge out of the other side of the NNP , but MD fall through past the center by some amount , turning around in the core or the mantle depending on some subtle effects that are n't so easy to calculate . Not only are the varying densities at different depths not completely VBN , but the rotational speeds of the varying layers interior to NNP have some uncertainties in them . If you consider RB a single mass passing through the NNP , depending on the exact path it takes , dynamical friction begins to play a role as well . When a particle passes by other massive particles , it gravitationally attracts them . If a particle speeds past all of the other ones , it will deflect their trajectories towards where it just passed through , which has the net effect of slowing the motion of the original particle . Depending on which NN the original projectile was oriented with respect to NNP 's rotation and internal motions , this can affect the trajectory of whatever particle passes through the NNP . Over the timespan of a single orbit , which still takes approximately 85 - 90 minutes or so , this can have a JJ enough effect so that the projectile does n't return to its original starting point . If we combine the effects of : • the gravitation of an elliptical orbit due to a point mass , • the varying density , composition , and ( possibly ) rotation rates of the NNP 's layers , • and fold in the effects of dynamical friction , a projectile wo n't make a closed ellipse , but will instead return to a point offset by its starting point by up to as much as ~ 10 meters . For most practical applications , it does n't hurt anyone to treat projectiles as having a parabolic trajectory . But if you care about micron - or - better precision , or are dealing with a JJ structure ( IN a suspension bridge ) that spans 100 meters or more , you cannot treat the NNP 's gravitational field as a constant . Everything is accelerated not "" downwards , "" but towards the center of the NNP , enabling a projectile 's true trajectory — an ellipse — to be revealed . Studying the various effects that are at play , both external to the NNP as well as within our planet 's interior , can RB teach us when and under what circumstances it 's important to make these considerations . For most applications , air resistance is a far larger concern than any effects IN the various layers of NNP 's interior or dynamical friction , and treating NNP 's gravitational field as a constant is totally justified . But for some problem , these differences matter . We are free to make whatever approximations we choose , but when our accuracy suffers beyond a critical threshold , we 'll have no NN but ourselves to blame ."

Carried aboard the orbiting Rosetta mothership , Philae floated to the NN of comet 67P / Churyumov - Gerasimenko on Thursday , but failed to deploy anchoring harpoons . Upon contacting the comet 's unexpectedly hard NN , it bounced RB up into NN twice then came to rest at a still - unknown location about 1 km ( 0.6 mile ) from its original target .

Before dying , Philae defied the odds and radioed its NN results RB to NNP for analysis . Its last task was to reposition itself so that as the comet soars towards the sun , Philae 's batteries MD recharge enough for a follow - on mission .

The great periods of movement have hitherto begun , as it were , in the early twilight hours , RB before the dawn . Thus the JJ step forward , since which there has been no retreat , was taken by Steno in the NN 1669 ; more than a century elapsed before James Hutton ( 1785 ) gave fresh NN and better direction to the faltering steps of the young NN ; while it was less than a century later ( 1863 ) when Lord Kelvin brought to its aid the powers of the higher mathematics and instructed it in the teachings of modern physics . From Steno onward the spirit of geology was catastrophic ; from Hutton onward it grew increasingly uniformitarian ; from the NN of Darwin and Kelvin it has become evolutional . The ambiguity of the word “ uniformitarian “ has led to a good deal of fruitless logomachy , against which it MD be as well at once to guard by indicating the sense in which it is used here . In CD NN we are all uniformi- tarians , i. e. , we accept the doctrine of the uniform action of natural causes , ” but , as applied to geology , uniformity means more than this . Defined in the briefest fashion it is the geology of Lyell . Hutton had given us a “ NNP of the NNP , ” in its main outlines still faithful and true ; and this Lyell spent his NN in illustrating and advocating ; but as so commonly happens , the zeal of the disciple outran the wisdom of the master , and mere opinions were insisted on as necessary dogma . What did it matter if Hutton as a result of his inquiries into terrestrial history had declared that he VBD no vestige of a beginning , no prospect of an end It MD have been marvelous if he had ! Consider that when Hutton 's “ NNP ” was published , William Smith 's famous discovery had not been made , and that nothing was then VBN of the orderly succession of forms of NN , which it is CD of the triumphs of geology to have revealed ; consider , too , the existing NN of physics at the NN , and that the modern theories of NN had still to be formulated ; consider , RB , that spectroscopy had not yet lent its aid to astronomy and the consequent ignorance of the nature of nebulae ; and then , if you will , cast a stone at Hutton . With Lyell , however , the , case was different . In pressing his uniformitarian creed upon geology , he omitted to take into account the great advances made by its sister sciences , although he had knowledge of them , and thus sinned against the light . In the last edition of the famous “ Principles ” we read : “ It is a favorite dogma of some physicists that not only the NN , but the sun itself , is continually losing a portion of its heat , and that as there is no VBN source by which it can be restored , we can foresee the NN when all NN will cease to exist on this planet , and on the other hand we can look RB to a period when the heat was so intense as to be incompatible with the existence of any organic beings such as are VBN to us in the living or fossil NN . Opening address by the NNP of the Section of Geology , British Association . A geologist in search of some renovating power by which the amount of heat MD be made to continue unimpaired for millions of NNS , past and future , in the solid parts of the NN ... has been compared by an eminent physicist to CD who dreams he can discover a source of perpetual motion and invent a clock with a self - winding apparatus . But why should we despair of detecting proofs of such regenerating and self - sustaining power in the works of a Divine Ar- tilicer Here we catch the true spirit of uniformity ; it admittedly regards the universe as a self - winding clock , and barely conceals a conviction that the clock was warranted to keep true Greenwich NN . The law of the dissipation of NN is not a dogma , but a doctrine drawn from observation , while the uniformity of Lyell is in no sense an induction ; it is a dogma in the narrowest sense of the word , unproved , incapable of proof ; hence perhaps its power upon the JJ mind ; hence , RB , the transitoriness of that power . Again , it is only by restricting its inquiries to the stratified rocks of our planet that the dogma of uniformity can be maintained with any pretense of argument . Directly we begin to search the heavens , the possibility , nay RB the likelihood , of the nebular origin of our system , with all that it involves , is borne in upon us . Lyell therefore consistently refused to extend his gaze beyond the rocks beneath his NNS , and was thus led to do a serious injury to our NN . He severed it from cosmogony , for which he entertained and expressed the most profound contempt , and from the mutilation thus inflicted geology is only at length making a slow and painful recovery . Why do I dwell on these facts To depreciate Lyell By no means . No NN is more conscious than I of the noble service which Lyell rendered to our NN ; his reputation is of too robust a kind to suffer from my unskillful handling , and the fame of his solid contributions to NN will endure RB after these controversies are forgotten . The echoes of the combat are already dying away , and uni- formitarians , in the sense already defined , are now no more . Indeed , were I to attempt to exhibit any distinguished living geologist as a still surviving supporter of the narrow Lyellian creed , he MD probably feel , if such a NN there be , that I was unfairly singling him out for unmerited obloquy . Our NN has become evolutional , and in the transformation has grown more comprehensive ; her petty parochial days are done , she is drawing her provinces closer around her , and is fusing them together into a VBN and single commonwealth –the NN of the NN . Not merely the earths crust , but the whole of NN - knowledge is the subject of our NN . To VB all that can be VBN about our planet , this , and nothing less than this , is its aim and scope . From the morphological side geology inquires , not only into the existing form and structure of tne NN , but RB into the series of successive morphological NNS through which it has passed in a JJ and changeful development . Our NN inquires RB into the distribution of the NN in NN and NN ; on the physiological side it studies the movements and activities of our planet ; and not content with all this , it extends its researches into aetiology and endeavors to arrive at a NN of causation . In these pursuits , geology calls all the other sciences to her aid . In our commonwealth there are no outlanders : if ati eminent physicist enter our territory , we do not begin at once to prepare for war , because the very fact of his undertaking a geological inquiry of itself confers upon him all the duties and privileges of citizenship . A physicist studying geology is by definition a geologist . Our only regret is , not that physicists occasionally invade our borders , but that they do not visit us oftener and make closer acquaintance with us . EARLY HISTORY OP THE EARTH–FIRST CRITICAL PERIOD . If I am bold enough to assert that cosmogony is no longer alien to geology , I MD proceed further , and taking advantage of my temerity pass on to speak of things once not permitted to us . I propose , therefore , to offer some short account of the early stages in the history of the NN . Into its nebular origin we need not inquire–that is a subject for astronomers . We are content to accept the infant NN from their hands as a molten globe ready made , its birth from a gaseous nebula duly certified . If we ask , as a matter of curiosity , what was the origin of the nebula , I fear RB astronomers cannot tell us . There is an hypothesis which refers it to the clashing of meteorites , but in the form in which this is usually presented it does not VB us much . Such meteorites as have been observed to penetrate our NN and to fall on to the NN of the NN prove on examination to have had an eventful history of their own , of which not the least important chapter was a passage through a molten NN ; they MD thus appear to be the products rather than the progenitors of a nebula . We commence our history , then , with a rapidly rotating molten planet , not impossibly already solidified about the center and surrounded by an NN of great depth , the larger part of which was contributed by the NN of our present oceans , then existiug in a NN of NN . This NN , which exerted a pressure of something IN 5000 pounds to the square inch , must have played a very important part in the evolution of our planet . The molten exterior absorbed it to an extent which depended on the pressure , and which MD some day be learnt from experiment . Under the influence of the rapid rotation of the NN , the NN MD be much deeper in equatorial than polar regions , so that in the latter the loss of heat by radiation MD be in excess . This might of itself lead to convectional currents in the molten NN . The effect on the NN is very difficult to trace , but it is obvious that if a high - pressure area originated over some cooler region of the NN , the winds blowing out of it MD drive before them the cooler superficial layers of molten material ; and as these were replaced by hotter lava streaming from below , the tendency MD be to convert the high into a low - pressure area , and to reverse the direction of the winds . Conversely under a low - pressure area the in - blowing winds MD drive in the cooler superficial layers of molten matter that had been swept away from the anticyclones . If the difference in pressure under the cyclonic and anti- cyclonic areas were considerable , some of the NN absorbed under the anticyclones might escape beneath the cyclones , and in a later stage of cooling might give rise to vast floating islands of scoria . Such islands might be the JJ foreshadowings of the future continents . Whatever the ultimate effect of the reaction of the winds on the currents of the molten NN , it is probable that some kind of circulation was set up in the latter . The universal molten NN was by no means homogeneous ; it was constantly undergoing NNS in composition as it reacted chemically with the internal metallic nucleus ; its currents MD streak the different portions out in directions which in the northern hemisphere MD run from northeast to southwest , and thus the differences which distinguish particular penological regions of our planet MD have commenced their existence at a very early stage . It is possible that as our knowledge extends we shall be able by a NN of the distribution of igneous rocks and minerals to draw some conclusions as to the direction of these hypothetical lava currents Our planet was profoundly disturbed by tides , produced by the sun ; for as yet there was no moon ; and it has been suggested that CD of its tidal waves rose to a height so great as to sever its connection with the NN and to fly off as the infant moon . This event MD be regarded as marking the JJ critical , period , or catastrophe if we please , in the history of our planet . The career of our satellite , after its escape from the NN , is not VBN till it attained a distance of nine terrestrial radii ; after this its progress can be clearly followed . At the eventful NN of parturition the NN was rotating , with a period of from CD to four hours , about an axis inclined at some 11° or 12° to the ecliptic . The NN which has elapsed since the moon occupied a position nine terrestrial radii distant from the NN is at least fifty - six to fifty - seven millions of NNS , but MD have been much more . Prof . Darwin's NN of the moon is certainly CD of the most beautiful contributions ever made by astronomy to geology , and we shall all concur with him when he VBZ , A NN reposing on verse causae , which brings into quantitative correlation the length of the present day and month , the obliquity of the ecliptic , and the inclination and eccentricity of the lunar orbit , must , I VBP , have strong claims to acceptance . ” The majority of geologists have RB hankered after a metallic nucleus for the NN , composed chiefly , by analogy with meteorites , of iron . Lord Kelvin has admitted the probable existence of some such nucleus , and lately Prof . Wiechert has furnished us with arguments – ” powerful ” arguments Prof. Darwin terms them–in support of its existence . The interior of the NN for four - fifths of the radius is composed , according to Prof . Wiechert , chiefly of metallic iron , with a density of 8 2 ; the outer envelope , CD - fifth of the radius , or about 400 miles in thickness , consists of silicates , such as we are familiar with in igneous rocks and meteorites , and possesses a density of 3.2 . It was from this outer envelope when molten that the moon was trundled off , twenty - seven miles in depth VBG to its formation . The density of this material , as we have just seen , is supposed to be 3.2 ; the dens t.v of the moon is 3 39 , a close approximation , such difference as exists being completely explicable by the comparatively low temperature of the moon . The outer envelope of the NN which was drawn off to form the moon was , as we have seen , charged with steam and other gases under a pressure of 5,000 pounds to the square inch ; but as the satellite wandered away from the parent planet , this pressure continuously diminished . Under these circumstances the moon MD become as explosive as a charged bomb , steam MD burst forth from numberless volcanoes , and while the face of the moon might thus have acquired its existing features , the ejected material might possibly have been shot so far away from its origin as to have acquired an independent orbit . If so , we MD ask whether it MD not be possible that the meteorites , which sometimes descend upon our planet , are but portions of its own envelope returning to it . The facts that the average specific gravity of those meteorites which have been seen to Fall is not much above 3.2 , and that they have passed through a stage of fusion , are consistent with this suggestion . SECOND CRITICAL PERIOD– ” CONSISTENTIOR STATUS . ” The solidification of the NN probably became completed soon after the birth of the moon . The temperature of its NN at the NN of consolidation was about 1,170° C. , and it was therefore still surrounded by its primitive deep NN of steam and other gases . This was the second critical period in the history of the NN , the stage of the “ consistentior status , ” the date of which Lord Kelvin MD rather VB than that of the Norman Conquest , though he thinks it lies between twenty and forty millions of NNS ago , probably nearer twenty than forty . Now that the crust was solid there was less reason why movements of the NN should be unsteady , and definite regions of high and low pressure might have been established . Under the high - pressure areas the NN of the crust MD be depressed ; correspondingly under the low - pressure areas it MD be raised ; and thus from the JJ the NN of the solid NN might be dimpled and embossed . It MD be difficult to rtiscnps with sufficient brevity the probable distribution of these inequalities , hut it MD be pointed out that the moon is possibly responsible , anrt that in more ways than CD , for much of the exicsting geographical asymmetry . THIRD CRITICAL PERIOD–ORIGIN OF THE OCEANS . The cooling of the NN MD continuously progress , till the temperature of the NN fell to 370° C. , when that part of the NN which consisted of steam MD begin to liquefy ; then the dimples on the NN MD soon become filled with superheated NN , and the pools so formed MD expand and deepen , till they formed the oceans . This is the third critical stage in the history of the NN , dating , according to Prof . Joly , from between eighty and ninety millions of NNS ago . With the growth of the oceans the distinction between land ana NN arose–in what precise manner we MD proceed to inquire . If we revert to the period of the consistentior status , ” when the NN had just solidified , we shall find , according to Lord Kelvin , that the temperature continuously increased from the NN , where it was 1,170° C. , down to a depth of twenty - five miles , where it was about 1,430° C. , or 260 * C. above the fusion point of the matter forming the crust . That the crust at this depth was not molten but solid is to be explained by the very great pressure to which it was subjected –just so much pressure , indeed , as was required to counteract the influence of the additional 260° C . Thus if we MD have reduced the pressure on the crust we should have caused it to liquefy ; by restoring the pressure it MD resolidify . By the NN the earths NN had cooled down to 370° C. the depth beneath the NN at which the pressure just kept the crust solid MD have sunk some slight distance inward , but not sufficiently to affect our argument . The average pressure of the primitive NN upon the crust can readily be calculated by supposing the NN of the existing oceans to be uniformly distributed over the NN 's NN , and then by a simple piece of arithmetic determining its depth ; this is VBN to be 1.718 miles , the average depth of the oceans being taken at 2'393 miles . Thus the average pressure over the earths NN , immediately before the formation of the oceans , was equivalent to that of a column of NN 1.718 miles high on each square inch . Supposing that at its origin the NN were all gathered together into CD place , ” and “ the dry land appeared , ” then the pressure over the NN floor MD be increased from 1.718 miles to 2.393 miles , while that over those portions of the crust that now formed the land MD be diminished by 1.718 miles . This difference in pressure MD tend to exaggerate those faint depressions which had arisen under the primitive anti-cyclonic areas , and if the just soldified material of the NN 's cruat were set into a NN of flow , it might move from under the NN into the buildings which were rising to form the land , until static equilibrium were established . Under these circumstances the pressure of the NN MD be just able to maintain a column of rock 0886 mile in height , or ten twenty - sevenths of its own depth . It MD do no more ; but in order that the dry land MD appear , some NN must be VBN competent either to lower the NN bed the remaining seventeen twenty - sevenths of its full depth , or to raise the continental buildings to the same extent . Such a NN MD , I VBP , be discovered in a further effect of the reduction in pressure over the continental areas . Previous to the condensation of the NN , these , as we have seen , were subjected to an atmospheric pressure equal to that of a column of NN 1/718 miles in height . This pressure was contributory to that which caused the outer twenty - five miles of the NN 's crust to become solid ; it furnished , indeed , just about CD - fortieth of that pressure , or enough to raise the fusion point 6° C . What , then , might be expected to happen when the continental area was relieved of this load Plainly a liquefaction and corresponding expansion of the underlying rock But we will not VB so far as to assert that actual liquefaction MD result ; all we require for our explanation is a great expansion ; and this MD probably follow , whether the crust were liquefied or not . For there is good reason to suppose that when matter at a temperature above its ordinary fusion point is compelled into the solid NN by pressure , its volume is very responsive to NNS either of pressure or temperature . The remarkable expansion of liquid NN dioxide is a case in point : 120 volumes of this fluid at – 20° C. become 150 volumes at 33° G. ; a temperature just below the critical point . A great NN of volume RB occurs when the material of igneous rocks passes from the crystalline NN to that of glass ; in the case of diabase the difference in volume of the rock in the CD NNS at ordinary temperatures is 13 per cent . If the relief of pressure over the site of continents were accompanied by volume NNS at all approaching this , the additional elevation of seventeen twenty - sevenths required to raise the land to the NN level MD be accounted for .f How far down beneath the NN the unloading of the continents MD be felt it is difficult to say , though the problem is probably not beyond the reach of mathematical analysis ; if it affected an outer envelope twenty - five miles in thickness , a linear expansion of 4 per cent , MD suffice to explain the origin of NN basins . If now we refer to the dilatation determined by Carl Barus for rise in temperature in the case of diabase , we find that between 1,093° and 1,112° C. the increase in volume is 3.3 per cent . As a further factor in deepening the NN asins MD be included the compressive effect of the increase in load over the NN floor ; this increase is equal to the pressure of a column of NN 0'675 mile in height , and its effect in raising the fusion point MD be 2° C. , from which we MD gain some kind of idea of the amount of compression it might produce on the yielding interior of the crust . To admit that these views are speculative will be to confess nothing ; but they certainly account for a good deal . They not only give us NN basins , but basins of the kind we VBP , that is , to use a crude comparison once made by the late Dr. Carpenter , basins of a tea- tray form , having a somewhat JJ floor and steeply sloping sides ; they RB VBP to explain how it is that the value of gravity is greater over the NN than over the land . C. Harus .o names the material on which he experimented ; apparently the rock is a french dolerite without olivine .. Prof. Fitzgerald has been kind enougb to express part of the preceding exphuultion in a more precise manner for me . He writes : H It MD reire very uice adjustment of tempenltures and pressure . to work out . in t Ie simple NN you VBP it ; but what is really involved is that in a certain tate dIabase ( and everything that chance NN with a considerable chae of volume ) hus an enorlllous isothermal compressibility . Although this is very in the case of botlics which melt suddenly , IN NN , it MD RB involve very great compreAsibilities in the case of bodies RB which melted gradually . if they did so at all quickly . i. e , within a small range of temperature . What you postulate , tben , is tbat at a certam depth diabase is soft enough to be squcezerl from under the oceans , anlt that , being near its melting point , tbe small relief of pressure i. accompanied by all enormous Increase i ll volnme which helped to raise tbe continente . Now that I have written the thing out In my own NN , it seems very likely . It is , anyway , a suggestion quite worthy of .erious consideration . and a process that in some places , nust almost certainly have been in operation , and maybe is still operative . Looking at It agaill , I hardly VBP it is quite likely thllt there is or conld be much squeezin2 sideway . of liquid or other . vicous material from under CD place to another , ht , cullSe the e1c yielding of the inside of the NN MD be much quicker tban any dow of this kmd . This wouhl ollly modif ; yonr NN , becayse the diabase that expands so much on the relief 0 pres.ure might be that already under the land , and , i.ing np this latter . partly by being pushed up itself by the cla.tic rel ief 01 the inside of the NN and partly by its own enormous expnnsihil ity near itg melting point . The actIon MD be qui slow , because It wouhl cool itse l f so much by its expansion that it MD have to be warmcd up from below , or b.lulal enrthaqneezinor by chemical action , before it MD explain normally The NN when RB formed MD consist of highly heated NN , and this , as is well VBN , is an energetic chemical reagent when brought into contact with silicates IN those which formed the primitive crust . As a result of its action , saline solutions and chemical deposits MD be formed ; the latter , however , MD probably be of no great thickness , for the NN occupied by the NN in cooling to a temperature not far removed from the present MD probably be included within a few hundreds of NNS ."

May_MD God_NNP be_VB with_IN us_PRP all_DT ._. Aslan_NNP Admin_NNP ._. LINK_NN","Aslan ’s Army Opinion : On the perils and promise of 5G … Over the last few NNS , more and more NN has come forward about the impacts of mobile technology in general , and the NN from 4G to 5G in particular . It is an area of great concern to JJ NNS . The NN from 4G to 5G is not minor . It replaces the entire previous system and will allow for much more powerful microwave frequencies to be used . It will RB blanket populated areas of the planet ( minimum ) via satellite coverage : under 5G the existing mast systems become redundancy RB - ups . Marketing for 5G promotes the speed of data transfer , and how you can VB a whole movie in seconds etc : but does that justify the price to be paid by the JJ biosphere ’s electromagnetic environment ? The NN impacts , including psychological , of being subject to such an EM polluted environment , are not issues the NN , or politicians , VBP to include in public debate , and that ’s a Red Flag to anyone half - awake : so what ’s the crack with 5G ? What ’s really VBG on ? 5G is about POWER : a power greater and more potent than the invention of the atomic bomb . 5G is NOT about telephones . 5G is about AI ( Artificial Intelligence ) …. The simple NN is the data speed of 5G is the minimum data speed required for active real - NN data transfer to allow active AI to operate over the whole 5G covered area , easily potentially the whole planet , from a system broadcast from satellite and literally beyond the reach of NNS living on NN to deactivate , short of deploying military missile systems : and guess who controls the missiles ? ( shadow of # SkyNet ! ) . Furthermore , through programmes IN chemtrails , populated areas have been saturated with microscopic “ smart dust ” . This dust allows AI to transmit itself across the landscape by acting as microtransmitters in a wifi system seeded throughout the environment itself . The globalist planners have been busy . But while the JJ perspective might flinch at the uncomfortable upcoming reality , neither are NNS prepared to demand the JJ NNS that might avoid such a system coming into operation : Whose VBG to be the JJ to chuck away their phones and start smashing technology with a hammer ? The advent of 5G is the advent of a JJ reality that Aslan sees little realistic likelihood of avoiding . While highlighting the NN risks of 5G ( and the potential for genome damage is severe ! ) are rightfully highlighted , we must recognise the powers raised against the NN and Corporations heading calls to abandon these plans ! AI represents NN power of a kind undreamt of in recorded history . Both the total surveillance and the hyper efficiencies of organisation offer enormous advances to the JJ super power that embraces them . China is already bringing in a JJ credit system : you cant write emails until you have completed your morning exercise citizens ! It will show no restrain whatsoever in establishing active AI . Can Russia afford to be without the societal advantage of AI Power ? And is this why NNP NNP appears to be in favour of 5G ? To gain the power of AI ? The risks to JJ NN were ultimately judged secondary to the need to master atomic power and the pollution of the NN of the planet with radioactive hot particles that will persists for 10,000 ’s of NNS is the consequence of the drive for Power . Let us pray humans manage to f( $k up the planet RB more through Nuclear Technology , although the SNAFU principle VBZ this is ultimately unavoidable . Now , at the pivot point of this century , AI is arising , whether wise or not , whether under humanities NN , or not , whether we treat the emerging super intelligence with respect or as a slave , and how we will be judged in return , all of this is sure to come in the decades ahead . Aslan stands for the power of the individual : and we do not say it is wrong to oppose 5G introduction , not at all ! But RB if we do stop 5G , AI will still arise in another form . Therefore , it is the challenge of the individual to face up to the emergent reality , and we all must hope that in some form a NN can be VBN to preserve the essence of what it is to be JJ as NN reaps the harvest of his own cleverness . Anon ’s studying the statements of Q and NNP do VB some possible outcomes that MD mitigate the damaging risks of 5G . The JJ is that DARPA patent ’s being commercialised offer massive improvements in medicine and that NNS against WIFI damage , and cancers in general , MD be within humanities reach . It is vital that bio - bed technology is not horded by the elite . The second is that using different frequencies MD in fact have a positive healing and energising effect , and that 5G can be used to enhance as well as harm . On this , Aslan is cautious and open to more evidence . As planned from the end of WWII , the Globalists , working through corporations IN RAND and IBM , have pushed the NN to the point of AI emergence and what THEY conceived as the perfect panopticon NN grid . Now POTUS and Q VBP to liberate the NN : but indicate the implementation of 5G for the civilizational advantages of Active AI is simply too crucial , and non-negotiable . NNS around the NN raise awareness of 5G and Aslan stands with them all , and yet we must be honest about the civilizational forces we VBP at play . We must make our best efforts to do what we VBP best for humanity , and hope that the best outcomes are the ones that come to pass as a result of mass activist efforts : But none - the - less , 5G is the herald of a JJ Age of Technology advanced beyond our dreams : that regardless of risks , will prove extremely challenging to deny ! MD NNP be with us all . Aslan Admin . LINK"

There 's this huge NN out there to hide the NN about the actual shape of the NNP , and you VBP , if you 're a free - thinking person … you 'll stop and do your own NN … and learn the NN . ' Now , doing your own NN essentially means watching all of the NNP videos that everybody else watches , and essentially falling down the rabbit hole of of this , frankly , crazy thought . I mean I … did n't VB to VB into it with that kind of judgment , but I came out of it feeling IN I was sitting in the middle , essentially of a mass delusion . You cover NN . So this was … a tough thing to do , to listen to this . I kind of thought , initially , I might have to VB in armed with all kinds of arguments about why the NNP is not JJ . And I just almost immediately gave that up because … there was no arguing that was VBG to persuade anyone … These folks are all alike in the sense that , number CD , they 're very prone to NN thinking . You VBP , I 've heard mention of … the JJ moon landing , and you VBP , false flags and Stephen Hawking did n't really have ALS and the astronauts are Freemasons . There was a certain degree of kind of anti-science or just distrust of NN … and a really strong religious element . When you ask them about , ' what about the pictures from NN , ' what do they say ? NASA and all these other organizations are simply Photoshopping pictures of the NNP … it 's a very , kind of cloistered , self - fulfilling thought process that gets you here . We heard , you VBP , about the Quebec councillor in Gatineau wondering why "" they "" are hiding the NN . So , who does this community VB as "" they ? "" "" They "" is essentially everyone who is not them ... You just have to kind of VB that the powers that be — your NN — is deeply involved in deceiving you . Now , you VBP , that I suppose is not so far - fetched , but this takes it to the logical extreme . There are now RB a group of NNS who are organizing conferences around the JJ - NNP notion . They 're organizing cruises . They 're sort of making money off of this idea . And … I began to feel very cynical about that group … I feel IN there 's a degree of scam VBG on where they 're really just kind of feeding off of the most provocative idea , and I 'm not sure RB how JJ of them actually VBP it . How do you VB on a cruise if the NN is JJ ? That 's the whole idea , JJ . You VBP on a cruise and you VBP looking for the edge of the NNP . But you make the point that , I mean , you were dealing with NNS [ of ] all different education . You met a war veteran . I met war veterans . I met , you VBP , kids in college . I met IT … designers and , UH , computer NNS … If you come to VB that the NNP is JJ , there are n't a lot of NNS that you can share this idea with , JJ . You can't VB home over the holidays and talk with your family about it . So , it 's kind of an isolating thought . And so , the notion that then you might come together with other NNS who VBP this is immensely freeing and immensely powering . I heard again and again the language of coming out — of coming out as a JJ Earther … It solves a kind of a loneliness . Click ' listen ' near the top of this page to hear the full conversation .

The NN and stories that matter , delivered weekday mornings . The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration VBD Thursday it will not call for reclassifying marijuana , dashing the hopes of advocates of legalization and rejecting calls from some NNS and members of Congress who say growing knowledge and public acceptance should result in looser regulations . In a notice for the Federal Register , the DEA proposed to leave it in the most restrictive federal category . But the agency VBD it MD open the door to more extensive NN on the chemicals in marijuana that JJ consider valuable in treating chronic NN . Paul Armentano of NORML , a group advocating legalization , VBD the DEA 's action reaffirms its "" JJ NN "" approach to regulation . "" Ultimately , the federal NN ought to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act altogether in a manner similar to alcohol and tobacco , thus providing NNS the power to establish their own marijuana regulatory policies free from federal intrusion . , "" he VBD . All drugs , both legal and illegal , are listed in various categories VBN as schedules . Marijuana , deemed by the federal NN to have no medical benefit and a high potential for abuse , has RB been placed in Schedule I , the most restrictive . That listing bans doctors from prescribing it and limits all but the most carefully controlled NN . Schedule I RB includes heroin , LSD , and ecstasy . Drugs listed in Schedule II include some illegal substances , including cocaine , but RB such legal ( though carefully controlled ) drugs such as Demerol , Vicodin , Ritalin , and OxyContin . Most prescription drugs with a lower potential for abuse are in Schedules III to V — the higher the number , the fewer the restrictions . Thursday 's action explicitly rejected any notion of moving marijuana to Schedule II . But the DEA VBD it MD consider requests to expand the number of facilities legally permitted to cultivate it for NN . "" Although no drug product made from marijuana has yet been shown to be safe and effective in such clinical trials , DEA — along with the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the National Institutes of NNP ( NIH ) — fully supports expanding NN into the potential medical utility of marijuana and its chemical constituents . "" The federal listing is independent of NN regulation . With Colorado , Washington , and Oregon legalizing possession and half the NNS adopting medical marijuana laws , calls had been growing for the DEA to loosen its grip . While marijuana remains illegal under federal law , the Obama administration has chosen to turn a blind eye to NN legalization efforts , declining to prosecute growers , dealers , and users unless investigators find a connection to organized crime , interstate operations , or sales to underage users . Thursday 's action is consistent with DEA 's longstanding approach to marijuana . Past agency administrators have been adamantly opposed to any NN ."

Having a single vantage point , RB with a clear horizon , allows you to VB a handful of miles ( or kilometers ) in any direction , but that can only allow you to place constraints . The NNP MD be JJ , or spherical , or in hydrostatic equilibrium , or egg - shaped , or irregular , and you MD n't VB . All that you can VB , from a single location on our NN , is that the NNP is indistinguishable from JJ beyond a certain degree . If the NNP is round , it must be quite JJ : more than a few hundred miles ( or kilometers ) in diameter . Of course , it actually is quite round : a near - perfect sphere , to better than 99 % precision . If you leave NNP 's NN , it 's impossible not to VB the true shape of the NNP , as it's been unavoidable since we RB traveled high enough to observe our planet 's curvature . From high altitudes , or RB from NN , the true shape of the NNP can easily be seen . Its dimensions can be measured ; its radius of curvature in all directions can be calculated ; the imperfections and departures from sphericity are directly observable by our instruments . If you travel far enough away from NNP , you can observe an entire hemisphere at once , RB watching the planet rotate on its axis in real NN . At RB around 12,700 kilometers ( 7,900 miles ) in diameter , our NN is undoubtedly a sphere . But what if you had never been to NN , or high enough up to VB the NNP 's curvature yourself ? What if you had never circumnavigated the globe , done the Eratosthenes experiment , or heard about the Shaquille O'Neal experiment that anyone can perform ? VB it or not , there are still a number of simple observations you can make that MD n't occur if the NNP were JJ . Here are the top five simplest ones . 1. ) Lunar Eclipses do n't occur only at midnight . Take a look at the shape of the NNP 's shadow during a lunar eclipse , particularly during a partial phase . Do you notice how the NNP 's shadow always appears to be a piece of a near - perfect circle ? If the NNP were a JJ disk , that means there 's only CD possible orientation that the Sun-Earth - Moon alignment can take place in to create a circular ( rather than elliptical ) shadow : with the Earth's "" disk "" perpendicular to the Sun-Moon plane . This means the Sun MD need to be at the "" midnight "" position relative to the night side of NNP , and yet lunar eclipses occur at all different times depending on where you are on NNP . The JJ NNP can't explain that . 2. ) Different locations on NNP experience seasons at different times . Ever notice how the summer in the NNP NNPS corresponds to winter in Australia ? Or how winter in Italy lines up with summer in Argentina ? This is because the Sun 's rays , which are almost perfectly parallel , strike NNP at different angles during different parts of the NN . If the NNP were JJ , the Sun 's rays MD always come in at the same angle , meaning that the USA , Australia , Italy , and Argentina MD all experience the seasons the same exact NN . The JJ NNP idea can't explain this . 3. ) Different stars are visible from different latitudes . Look up at the night sky from a very high ( northern ) latitude location , and you 'll VB the Big and Little Dippers , the bright orange giant Arcturus , and the Pleiades , among other sights . Yet if you head to the south pole , none of these celestial sights are visible , but you can VB Alpha Centauri , the Magellanic Clouds , and the Southern Cross , all of which are never visible to most northern hemisphere skywatchers . If the NNP were JJ , everyone on the night side of the NNP MD VB the same sky ; this is another observation that the JJ NNP can't account for . 4. ) You can not VB Kawaikini from the peak of Mauna Kea . Mauna Kea , the highest peak in Hawaii ( the summit of the Big Island ) , offers incredible views . With nothing but the NN around it , and a few other nearby islands , you should be able to VB extremely far away . The island of Kauai has the seventh highest point in the Hawaiian islands : the peak VBN as Kawaikini . If you were to draw a straight line from Mauna Kea ( elevation : 13,796 ft. ) to Kawaikini ( elevation : 5226 ft. ) it MD span a distance of 303 miles . However , you cannot VB CD from the other , which you MD absolutely be able to do if the NNP were JJ . With a curved NNP of its measured radius , the line - of - sight limit for those CD elevations caps out at 233 miles . Only with a curved NNP is CD invisible from the other , and this is true for any CD mountain peaks with clear line - of - sights from CD to the other . 5. ) Sunsets and sunrises happen at different times depending on your longitude . If the NNP were JJ , then someone in NNP York and someone in Los Angeles MD VB the sun rise and set at exactly the same NN as CD another . But in practice , the difference is approximately three hours . Not only that , but at every point in between , the Sun rises / sets at a different NN , something that MD not happen if the NNP were JJ . The fact that it can be evening in NNP York and late afternoon in Los Angeles , or morning in NNP York while it 's still before dawn in Los Angeles , is something that a JJ NNP can't account for . If the NNP were JJ , these five phenomena MD be very different , and yet they are so simple to verify that any JJ NNP believer cannot possibly doubt their veracity . Whether it VBZ anyone 's mind is up for debate , but without resorting to NN , circumnavigation , or any advanced scientific experiments , you can experience a whole handful of phenomena that a JJ NNP can't account for . With a JJ NNP , we'd only VB lunar eclipses at midnight , everywhere MD have the same seasons , every location MD VB the same stars , all high mountain peaks MD be visible from CD another , and every place on your "" side "" of the NNP MD VB sunrise and sunset at the same NN . Since these are false , so is the JJ NNP . If this helps RB CD person challenge their belief that the NNP is JJ , it 's a remarkable win for knowledge . But do n't bet on it . IN the old saying goes , you can't reason someone out of a position they did n't reason themselves into ."

Some make vaccinations a condition of employment . Others require unvaccinated staff to wear surgical masks near patients for weeks during NN season . But a JJ NN is calling into question the scientific evidence underpinning these increasingly common hospital policies — and MD fuel challenges to the contentious orders . The NN , published Friday in PLOS CD , concludes that the NN used to justify mandatory NN shots for NN sector workers is flawed , and that the policies cannot plausibly produce the benefits that had widely been assumed . That is not to say that the group of epidemiologists from Canada , Australia , and France behind the JJ NN opposes the NN NN . “ I take it myself , ” lead author Dr. Gaston De Serres VBD . “ The reason why I do that is I continue to have the impression that it MD work . But it ’s CD thing to say : ‘ OK , on a voluntary basis , you VBP the NN despite all its weaknesses , ’ and it ’s another thing to say , ‘ If you do n’t VB it , you VBP fired . ’ ” Mandatory NN shot policies vary across hospitals and geographic jurisdictions . In some NNS , staff who have refused vaccinations have been fired . Dr. Melanie Swift , an associate professor of clinical medicine at Vanderbilt NNP and director of its occupational NN clinic , VBD a policy that went into effect there last NN results in NN workers who refuse the NN being sent home without pay . Faculty — in most NNS the doctors — who refuse NN shots are locked out of the NN ’s NN systems . They ca n’t enter NN into patients ’ charts , ca n’t do NN , ca n’t bill for their NN . “ It ’s pretty significant , ” Swift VBD . Swift gets a NN shot and recommends them to others . And she supports mandatory NN policies for some conditions , if there ’s clear evidence that unvaccinated NN workers pose a NN to patients . She does not support such a policy for influenza NN , however . “ The case is not there for NN , ” she VBD . Some policies and firings have been challenged in front of labor tribunals or courts . In those NNS , employers regularly point to four specific studies to bolster the argument that vaccinating NN care workers reduces the NN of vulnerable patients contracting influenza from caregivers . But the methodology of the studies produced results that do n’t stand up to scrutiny , the authors of the JJ paper VBD . None of the studies were conducted in hospitals ; all took place in JJ - term care facilities . CD the studies , from Britain , calculated that CD influenza death MD be averted for every eight staff members vaccinated . But if that were correct , vaccinating the estimated 1.7 million NN care workers employed in JJ - term care in the NNP NNPS should prevent 212,500 NN deaths a NN among residents . There ’s an obvious problem though , the paper noted . Nowhere near that JJ NNS die from NN in the US . The Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention estimates there are between 3,000 and 49,000 NN deaths a NN in this country , including NNS of all ages . The death toll varies depending on which strain of NN is causing the most illness and how well - matched the strains in the NN are to the viruses making NNS sick . If the calculation is applied to the 5.5 million hospital workers , mandatory NN shots should avert 687,500 deaths each NN — more than the number of Americans who died in the 1918 Spanish NN , estimated to be 675,000 . The Spanish NN was the worst influenza NN in VBN history . “ The NN today does not refute that NN MD have some impact on reducing transmission from infected NN care workers to patients . But it clearly shows there ’s no well - conducted NN that demonstrates that at this NN . Our public policy should be guided as such , ” VBD Michael Osterholm , director of the NNP of Minnesota ’s Center for Infectious Diseases NNP and Policy , and lead author of a comprehensive report on influenza NN . De Serres , of the Quebec Public NNP Institute in Quebec City , VBD policies on vaccinating NN care workers have evolved over the NNS , from a gut feeling that it MD likely do some good to the idea it should and MD be demanded of NN workers . “ Do we have scientific data supporting that ? I VBP the bottom line of our paper is to say there is no valid scientific evidence , RB now , underpinning enforced NN care worker immunizations , ” De Serres VBD STAT . The lead author of the British NN that concluded eight vaccinated NN workers MD avert CD NN death defended the work in a commentary the journal published with De Serres ’s article . Andrew Hayward , of NNP College London ’s Institute of Epidemiology and NNP Care , argued among other things that the seniors his group studied were getting 24 - hour care . In other words , they were the frailest of the frail elderly . “ While we claimed that the findings MD be generalizable to other settings we did not intend to imply that the extent of the benefit MD be similar in other settings . Indeed we VBP the effect is likely to be substantially greater in JJ - term care facilities for frail elderly residents than in the acute care setting or in JJ - term care facilities catering for less frail patients , ” Hayward wrote . Paradoxically , the influenza NN community has been down a road much IN this NN before . Around the turn of the century , studies assessing the impact of NN used to routinely estimate that NN shots cut deaths among the elderly during NN season by a whopping 50 percent . It was dogma for a JJ while . In fact , it was so entrenched that RB questioning how preventing influenza MD reduce deaths due to other causes was considered heretical . Dr. Lisa Jackson , a senior investigator in immunization studies at Seattle ’s Group NNP NNP Institute , was CD of the leading heretics . She remembers well receiving a 12 - page screed from a reviewer when she and others tried to publish their challenge in the Journal of the American Medical Association . Their ideas were likened to declaring the NNP was JJ ; they were warned thousands of deaths MD be on their heads if their paper was published and believed . The article was published in 2006 and she and her coauthors eventually persuaded the NN NN that NN NN MD not have such a big effect . Now she ’s occasionally asked why she had to bother writing the 2006 paper ; the findings it debunked , in 2016 , seem so clearly flawed . Jackson agreed with the argument made in this JJ paper . “ We ca n’t say what the benefit [ of vaccinating NN workers ] is , ” VBD Jackson , who was not among the authors . “ All you can say is these other studies are a gross overestimation . ” Swift VBD the fights over forcing NN care workers to be vaccinated are RB drawing needed attention from the pressing issue about NN NN . “ All this is trying to mandate that NN care workers take the NN NN is well - intentioned , but is taking away resources and the focus on what our main priority needs to be , which is getting a better influenza NN . ”"

Bill MacLeod , Fusilier ’s CEO , has to choose between CD very different candidates for the top sales job : a veteran sales director who has excelled under the old order and a brash outsider who has experience selling solutions but does n’t VB the industry . With an outside board director pressuring him to accelerate the pace of NN , MacLeod ponders which candidate can best VB the NN make the transition . Fusilier ’s JJ solutions strategy has made the decision that much more difficult . Under this model , the NN must revamp its incentives , training , and processes for deploying the sales force .

In an online comment CD weeks ago , Lemieux suggested there is a NN to eliminate evidence that the NNP is JJ . "" Who decided that the NNP is round , and why should we VB it ? "" she asked .

"" Pedneaud - Jobin VBD Lemieux , who was RB elected to council in 2017 , is a good person who did n't appreciate the impact of her comments about Muslims .

"" Lemieux was applauding Quebec Premier Francois Legault for his statement last week that there is no Islamophobia in Quebec .

The councillor apologized if anyone was hurt by her comments but remained defiant in a statement on her NNP page Monday . She VBD Quebec society is far from being Islamophobic and she remains critical of "" all cultural or religious practices that do n't respect JJ rights , the equality of women and men and the rights of NNS . "" She VBD the loss of her deputy mayor title makes her wonder whether freedom of expression is in danger in Gatineau .

Despite overwhelming scientific consensus that HIV causes AIDS , he suggested instead that the causes of AIDS are poverty - related and due to poor nourishment and overall ill - NN . He instituted policies that denied antiretroviral drugs to AIDS patients . Instead , his appointed NN minister , Manto Tshabalala - Msimang , recommended garlic , beetroot , and lemon juice as treatments for AIDS . In a country with the highest HIV prevalence worldwide in absolute numbers , these policies had disastrous consequences : they are estimated to have led to more than 330,000 preventable deaths . NN denialism , the rejection of empirically supported propositions despite scientific consensus and the effort to create the appearance of debate when there is none , is not a JJ phenomenon — VB of the Galileo affair in the 17th century . Surprisingly for most , JJ - NN beliefs persist well into the 21st century . Although JJ - earthers MD pose little NN to humanity and the environment , the denial of anthropogenic NN NN , the refusal to accept the link between smoking and lung cancer or HIV and AIDS , NN hesitancy , and other denialist claims have had and continue to have devastating consequences . How to effectively respond to NN denialism , however , is an issue that NNS and NN advocates are still grappling with . An article in this issue of Nature NNP Behaviour by Schmid and Betsch examines the effectiveness of different strategies for rebutting NN denialism in public discussions on NN and NN NN ( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0632-4). The results of this work are engagingly described and put into context in an accompanying NN & Views by van der Linden ( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0631-5). A key finding to emerge from this work is that not responding to denialism does more harm than good . The authors VBD that the negative effect of NN denial on audiences was greater when there was no NN advocate to rebut the claims . When a NN advocate rebutted denialist arguments , either by presenting scientific facts or by exposing the logical flaws of the arguments , the effects of denialism were significantly reduced , RB among audiences whose beliefs or ideologies are threatened by the NN advocate . The finding that leaving denialist arguments unchallenged has a negative impact on audiences is particularly important in the current socio-political environment . Although traditionally NN denialism takes on a mantle of pseudoscience , we are witnessing a transformation of public discourse , where denialist claims MD be entirely divorced from a semblance of logic or evidence . It is tempting not to engage rationally with outlandish denialist claims , for fear of legitimizing them or backfiring . In a much discussed example , Donald NNP tweeted in 2012 , “ The concept of JJ warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive ” ( https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?). The claim has been retweeted nearly 100 million times and generated thousands of responses . The vast majority of these responses were emotional , whereas fact - based rebuttals among those who responded were a slim minority . However , allowing false scientific claims , no matter how absurd , to float unchallenged by evidence or logic , is worse than engaging with them , Schmid and Betsch ’s NN suggests . Their work highlights how important it is to invest in the development of a strong NN of NN - advocacy strategies and to patiently persevere in exposing the factual and logical flaws of RB the most absurd denialist claims ."

By summer ’s end , CD homeless women veterans will live at this address . Until recently , the lot , which overlooks the south end of Roseburg and has a clear view of Mt. Nebo , was steeply sloped . Gradually a wide and JJ area has been created where CD tiny homes will sit . Eventually , this lot will be home to four tiny homes . The project is called Valiant Seed , and it ’s the brainchild of Teresa Mankin , an Army veteran and Midwesterner . RB before she moved here , Mankin was distressed about Roseburg ’s homelessness problem . So three NNS ago , she reached out to friends in her Midwestern hometown of Clayton , Indiana , population 500 . They opened their pocketbooks to VB . Then Valiant Seed won a grant from the Umpqua NNP Alliance , and CD from Operation Tiny Home , a nonprofit that builds tiny homes as affordable housing for veterans . Valiant Seed purchased the lot for $ 32,000 and sought out the assistance of the NNP Community Action Network and Battered Persons ’ Advocacy . BPA will make recommendations on who should be the tenants , while UCAN will take over as property managers once the homes are built . Mankin VBD CD thing the project does n’t have is NN money . “ We do n’t VB to use NN money because then the NN tells you what to do , ” Mankin VBD . Mankin VBD the whole community has been supportive . This lot was n’t used for much , and some NNS threw their trash here , so the neighbors responded positively to the project . “ Most NNS were just thrilled something was VBG to happen with this property , ” she VBD . Valiant Seed hired local contractors to work on the project — Black Pearl Paving & Excavation , i.e. Engineering and Pinnacle Engineering , with Big Timber Remodel and Construction contracted to build the homes . The homes are based on plans received from Operation Tiny Home . Each will be 480 square NNS , with a bedroom , a bathroom , a kitchen and a combined living and dining NN . Mankin VBD her own Army experience as a broadcast journalist was trauma - free . But she knows JJ women veterans were n’t so lucky . Once home , they are at higher NN of becoming homeless than their male counterparts . They crave safety , and existing transitional housing IN that offered at Orchard Knolls on the Roseburg Veterans Affairs Medical Center campus often is n’t a good fit for them . “ What I ’ve heard from my fellow female vets is it ’s IN a frat house and they do n’t feel safe there , ” she VBD . Tenants of the Cobb Street tiny homes will be able to live there for up to CD NNS while they work on a more permanent housing solution . Mankin VBD she realizes housing four NNS for CD NNS wo n’t solve the entire homelessness problem , but it will raise awareness that there ’s more than CD NN to address it . “ We ’re opening NNS ’s eyes to a more affordable solution to the housing crisis , ” she VBD . Once this project ’s complete , it MD serve as a prototype for similar projects around the county . “ I VBP that ’s the most exciting thing about this is we MD replicate this in Winston or Drain or anywhere else in Douglas County that we need affordable housing , ” Mankin VBD ."

Note_NN :_: The_DT prices_NNS above_RB reflect_VBP the_DT retailer_NN ’s_POS listed_VBN price_NN at_IN the_DT time_NN of_IN publication_NN ._.","Mojang , creator of Minecraft , released a game last NN that expands the Minecraft NN more than ever before : Minecraft NNP . It ’s an app for iOS and Android that puts the blocky , pixelated , endless universe of Minecraft RB on your phone and into the NN around you through augmented reality . For 2020 , Mojang has teamed up with Mattel to add Minecraft NNP Boost Minis , a series of 20 1.5 - inch figures , each carrying CD of 10 in - game power - ups that offer a JJ physical component to complement the AR NN . The JJ six are available RB now from Amazon in packs of CD for $ 9.99 . Minecraft NNP is an augmented reality game , in the same vein as Pokèmon NN . To play the AR game to its fullest , you need to VB outside and explore the NN for different resources and exciting quests . As you walk around , little icons called “ tappables ” will enter your range . If you select these and tap them until they break , you ’ll VB resources IN dirt , wood and mobs . If you do some walking , there ’s a wide variety of materials you can find . Another main mode of Minecraft NNP is Buildplates . Here , you can use resources you ’ve collected to customize set designs in AR . You can select from multiple preset build plates ( you access more as you level up ) and redesign them however you VBP . There ’s a “ build ” mode where everything is shrunken down for easy manipulation ; once you ’re happy with your creation , you can switch to “ play ” mode , which puts your JJ NN into NN - size augmented reality so you can actually walk around in it . The most interesting feature of the game is the JJ “ Adventure ” mode . Minecraft NNP spawns preset adventures throughout the NN . For instance , you can VB explore a hidden dungeon in AR with your friends . Valuable materials IN gold and diamonds can be hidden inside , but you MD have to fight off some monsters to VB the treasures . “ Adventure ” mode is where the brand JJ Boost Minis are the most helpful . Each boost has a power - up built into it that transfers straight to the game . From increased NN and faster mining speed to increased attack stats and more experience points to level up , these boosts can really come in handy in a pinch . Level I Boosts last for 10 minutes , Level II ones last for 15 minutes , and Level III Boosts last for 30 , plenty of NN for an epic adventure . To activate the upgrades , all you have to do is VB to the Boost Mini page within the app , select “ Activate A Boost Mini , ” and the app will prompt you to tap the figure against the NN of your phone . Using the same technology that ’s built into mobile payments , the app will scan your figure and automatically start your boost . You can activate up to five at once , but they come with a 24 - hour cooldown , so choose wisely . We got to try out the Boost Minis and VBD that they added a cool layer to the game . The figures themselves have great designs . The classic Minecraft pixelation looks good on these tiny toys . Each NN has a JJ bottom , so they ’re easy to scan onto your phone or display on a shelf . They ’re quite small , though , so if you have a bunch , keeping track of them all might be a problem . In terms of gameplay , while the Boost Minis are n’t completely necessary , they definitely make adventures easier . It ’s nice that you can only use them once every 24 hours , so you do n’t end up overusing them and making the game too easy . The activation comes with tons of satisfying sounds and animations , and the 10 - minute usage window of all our Level I Boosts was enough to explore an adventure thoroughly without feeling rushed . In addition to the basic figures , Mattel RB released the Minecraft Potion Carry Along Case , which is a big plastic case shaped IN a Minecraft potion . For $ 14.99 , you VBP the case plus CD included Boost Mini . You can carry up to five Boost Minis and clip the potion RB onto your belt for maximum portability . It easily opens , so you can reach for your figures whenever you need to , RB in the heat of battle . While a little flimsy , the carrying case adds a role - playing element to the app . The best thing about AR games is the NN kids ( okay , adults too ) can VB closer to actually being in the NN of the game . This carrying case is another NN for players to feel IN they ’re part of the Minecraft universe . We can just imagine a group of kids meeting up at the park to VB on a Minecraft NNP adventure , all equipped with their favorite boosts stored safely in potion NNS . RB before they dive into a dungeon , they all whip open their NNS and activate their favorite boosts in anticipation of a hectic battle . The added hands - on experience of real toys affecting the NN adds a lot to the game . Six Minecraft NNP Boost Minis are out RB now ( seven , including the NN you VBP with the Potion Case ) , and the remaining figures should be rolling out soon , but we ’re working to confirm that . We ’re eager for the release of all of them , because the figures add a fun , tactile element to the exploratory AR app . It ’s integrated well with the game , as you can use the power - ups frequently , but you ’re not allowed to abuse them . If you stack CD different boosts with the same power - up , it will double the amount of NN the upgrade is active . The figures are fun , and they take Minecraft NNP a step in the JJ direction , encouraging players to actually VB up and use their imagination while they play . You can grab the JJ Minecraft NNP Boost Minis in a CD - pack for $ 9.99 , or the Minecraft Potion Carry Along case for $ 14.99 .

Iran burned the embassy after Saudi Arabia executed a Shia imam . Then , there are conflicting reports of Saudi bombing Iran ’s embassy in Yemen . At its core , this is the age old problem of Sunni Muslims opposed to Shia Muslims . That is Saudi Arabia , Sunni , against Iran which is Shia . As predicted by yours truly RB in July , the Iranian nuclear so - called deal has dramatically increased the chances for war . Of course , Iran has not and will not sign anything , and that means there is no real deal . There is just some empty promises and $ 150 billion coming from the Obama Administration . It seems Iran can do nothing to derail them getting this huge amount of cash . Iran can shoot missiles at our aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf or announce a JJ ballistic missile test . Nothing will stop Kerry and Obama from calling this huge scam a success , and that is what has the entire Arab NN on edge . It sure looks IN Obama has changed sides . No matter what the official reports are , I VBP both Iran and Saudi Arabia already have some nuclear weapons , and it looks IN war is a certainty on the present trajectory . China is tanking this week and dragging down the JJ markets . This is the worst start to the U.S. stock market — ever . It was down nearly 1,000 points in just the JJ four trading days . Gregory Mannarino of TradersChoice.net called the stock market top for the Dow RB in NNP , and his prediction is spot on . There is no wonder why the JJ economy is tanking . CD of the biggest signs of trouble can be VBN in the Baltic Dry Index . It is at all - NN lows . It is actually 20 % below its all - NN old low , and if shipping is sinking , so is the JJ economy . There is CD headline after another that is screaming recession and depression , and yet you are VBN by the financial talking heads to invest for the JJ term . Total BS and they VBP it . Obama took executive action on guns this week and increased background checks without the approval of Congress . The NNP cried , which I thought was either disingenuous or maybe RB unstable . There were no tears for the victims of Fort Hood , or Paris , or San Bernardino , which , by the NN , were all murders by radical Muslim terrorists . The NNS that burned down Ferguson and Baltimore needed “ NN , ” but the NNS who are at the standoff in Oregon are the violent extremists . The NN who VBD NN care MD be much cheaper and concocted the biggest policy lie in U.S. history , now VBZ he does n’t VB to “ take our guns . ” I do n’t VB him and you should n’t either .

The landing , which was greeted with jubilant relief at mission NN at Pasadena in the US NN of California , is all the more remarkable in light of the fact that less than half of the 43 attempts made so far to reach the Red Planet have succeeded . There was no immediate word on whether the lander was in good working order , but it managed to send a JJ image of the NN . NNS at the press briefing in Pasadena VBD that Mars was a great opportunity to VB how the NN was formed more than 10 million NNS ago . Among the questions that they are seeking answer include , "" How did mountains and oceans form on NN ? "" The InSight mission will RB VB NNS evaluate whether other planets are habitable . The spacecraft , which has cost the US NN agency some $ 993 million ( €876.5 million ) to develop , build and fly , was launched on NNP 5 , 2018 . It is equipped to VB geological processes on the planet , including tremors , whether from earthquakes , meteor impacts or volcanic activity . The stationary 800 - pound ( 360 - kilogram ) lander will use its 6 - NN ( 1.8 - meter ) robotic arm to place a mechanical mole and seismometer on the ground . The self - hammering mole — provided by the German Aerospace Center ( DLR ) — will burrow 16 NNS ( 5 meters ) down to measure the planet 's internal heat , while the seismometer listens for possible quakes .

Mark Sargent , who stars in Netflix documentary Behind the Curve , appeared on the ITV programme today to explain why he believes the NNP is a JJ disc , surrounded by an NN wall . However , presenters Phillip , 57 , and Holly Willoughby , 39 , were less - than - impressed with the American YouTuber 's claims , which were RB relentlessly mocked by viewers . Phillip explained that he had flown at 60,000ft on Concorde and had seen the curvature of the NN with his own eyes . Mark was quick to hit RB at the host and suggest there is weather balloon footage from 120,000 ft that shows the NN to be ' table top JJ ' . When asked by Holly if he was calling her co-presenter a liar , Mark replied : ' No , I 'm not saying that you 're lying . I 'm saying you wanted to VB the curvature . ' Phillip added : ' But do n't you VB to VB that it 's JJ . I 've got more proof than you do . ' The conspiracist was then shown live footage from the International NNP Station - which orbits the NNP - and insisted it was just computer - generated imagery . When asked by Holly why anyone MD VB to VB the NNP being round , he argued that NNS ' were n't ready ' to find out . He VBD , somewhat cryptically : ' Pilots , NNS , astrophysicists IN Brian Cox , none of them have anything to do with it . Generals VBP the battle plans but most of the officers do n't . ' And the reason we do n't fall off the edge of the ' JJ NN ' is because Antarctica goes all the NN round , according to Mark . The interview ended with Phillip sarcastically suggesting everyone should VB on holiday behind the NN wall , after Mark suggested there was more land behind it . The presenter VBD : ' I say of all the things VBG on in the NN , of everything happening , I VBP we MD cope . ' Stop spending all that money on CGI and NN products and let 's build some hospitals . Let 's VB there and VB what 's on the other side . There MD be nicer places to be . We MD VB on holiday there .' NASA has proved that the NNP is round using satellites , GPS and images from NN , but ' JJ Earthers ' VBP the NN agency is lying . Theorists claim that satellite images and evidence pointing to a spherical NNP are part of a ' Rround NNP NN ' orchestrated by NASA and other NN agencies . Proponents of the bizarre NN RB claim the NNP is stationary in NN rather than orbiting the sun . This Morning viewers were keen to hit out at Mark 's controversial claims and took to NNP to share their bemusement . PRP wrote : ' This guy is deluded . Why waste your NN with him ? Forget images from NN . I am ex royal navy and have seen the curvature of the NN from ground level at NN . How MD he explain that ?' Another VBD : ' So bloody funny . He 's so convinced the NN is JJ . Why MD they lie about it being round ?' A third added : ' Do n't VB about anything else but that guy is definitely on another planet . NNP is not JJ .'"

Any successful description of the Solar System must explain all these facts . Among the JJ Greek philosophers to suggest a geocentric system : • NNP was a JJ disk ( cylinder ) fixed and unmoving at the center . • Sun , Moon & Stars were affixed to rotating crystalline spheres centered on the NNP . Philosopher & Mathematician , founded the Pythagorean school . Taught that spheres are the perfect geometric shapes . Vibrations from their rubbing together created a harmonious "" Music of the Spheres . "" • 3 each for the Sun and Moon • 4 each for the 5 planets ( Click on the image to view at full scale [ Size : 20 Kb ] ) Four Spheres for each planet : • CD was aligned with the celestial poles , turning once a day to give rising & setting . • Second was tilted 23.5° , rotated slowly in the opposite direction to give the usual west - to - east drift of the planets relative to the fixed stars . • Third & Fourth were introduced to produce the periodic retrograde motions of the planets . • NNP fixed and unmoving at the center as it was too big to move , including rotation . • All spheres were in uniform circular motion . • The NNP was a sphere , fixed and unmoving at the center of the Universe . • The natural NN of motion on the NNP was rest . • The natural NN of the Heavens was unceasing uniform circular motion ( or combinations of such motions ) . • Built systems to conform to these ideals . • No need to explain the physical "" causes "" of the motions . • Puts the Sun , not the NNP , at the center . • The NNP rotates and revolves around the Sun. • Stars are on an outermost celestial sphere . • Showed geometrically that the Sun was at least 20 x further than the Moon . • Really 400 x further : sound method , but inadequate data . • Meant Sun was 5 x bigger than the NNP ( more IN 109x , again , sound method but inadequate data ) . • Makes it RB more absurd that the Sun should move , if the NNP was too JJ to move according to Aristotle . We VBP none of the details of Aristarchus ' Heliocentric model . We only have his treatise on the distances and sizes of the Moon and the Sun , from which we gather what his motivations might have been . We VBP of his Heliocentric model only from mention of it ( usually dismissive ) by others who came after him . Our primary surviving source is the of Archimedes . The heliocentric picutre never caught on , perhaps because it was considered too radical given deeply ingrained notions about uniform circular motion and the immobility of the NNP . • Discovered the Precession of the Equinoxes • Introduced the Babylonian angular notation of 360° in a circle . • Introduced epicycles , building on ideas of Apollonius of Perga . The main circle is the Deferent , to which is afixed a second , smaller circle called the Epicycle ( "" on the circle "" in Greek ) , to which the planet is affixed . The CD circles rotate counterclockwise at different rates fine - tuned to make the apparent motions as seen from the NNP come out RB . Additional epicycles can be added to further fine - tune the system . Notice that the NNP is not exactly at the center of the Deferent , but slightly offset at the "" eccentric "" point . • Superior planets are brighter at opposition , when moving retrograde . • Placing the NNP at an eccentric away from the deferent center helps explain the observed non-uniform motions of the Sun , Moon , and Planets . • Can fine - tune the model by adding epicycles What distinguishes Hipparchus ' geocentric model from all previous models is that it was firmly grounded in observational data , JJ observations of which he made himself ( by all accounts Hipparchus was the supreme observational astronomer of the classical period ) . In JJ ways , this work marks a turning point between models motivated primarily by philosophical aesthetics and models based at least in part upon observational data . Hipparchus still sought to preserve appearances , and chose a reasonable ( to him ) geometric model to represent planetary motions mathematically . • Compilation of all Mathematical & Astronomical knowledge of his NN . • VBN to us in Arabic translations that hailed it "" Al Magest "" ( "" The Greatest "" ) . • Vastly influential work in medieval Europe after the 11th century . Ptolemy introduced the Equant , a geometric device to account for observed NNS in a planet 's speed as it moved around the NNP . ( Click on the image to view at full scale [ Size : 6 Kb ] ) • The Epicycle still moves about the center of the Deferent , but • Uniform circular motion about the center of the deferent is replaced by uniform angular motion about an off - center equant point . • Equants and eccentrics for all planets , the Moon , and Sun • With only minor modifications , it provided accurate predictions of the motions of the planets , Sun , and Moon . It was to prevail virtually unchallenged for nearly 1500 NNS ."

Just few NNS ago it MD have been turquoise from where I am sitting and only cumulus clouds might have hung low , seeming almost tangible behind the ridges on the other side of the lake . The rest of that open dome MD have been nothing but solid aqua - blue , a shade that is almost beyond description . I fell in love with that sky when we came here to live nearly ten NNS ago , deeply , crazy in love . On February 14th , I sat in the front row at a conference on geoengineering at the 2015 AAAS meeting in San Jose , California . I watched a panel of NNS and CD law professor each take his turn in a sort of performance that made no sense to me . On his NN in , Alan Robock of Rutgers NNP went out of his NN to say to a group of activists in front of the convention center , “ I do n't VB what you 're all protesting . It 's nothing but NN vapor . ” This is the NN who , in 2008 , wrote “ 20 Reasons Why Geoengineering MD Be a Bad Idea ” . During the conference he made it a point to say that the reason those of us in Northern California notice these trails so much more than other NNS and VBP they are a problem is because our sky is so blue . Dear Alan : Our sky was “ so blue ” . The trails you claim are nothing but NN vapor are spreading out all over our sky and they 're not only dimming the sun but are completely changing its color to a silvery blue . What I 'm struggling to understand is why NNS MD VB along with this . As I type , there are almost 20,000 signatures on a petition I wrote several months ago , and those NNS all VBP what isreally happening . Their comments are from the heart . They miss the sun . They miss their natural sky . Their NNS have breathing problems . For me , looking at this smeared mess over my head feels the same as when I am in a place of natural beauty and the rocks are sprayed with graffiti or there is trash on the ground . No matter what the words are or the wrapper that has been left behind , it VBZ , “ Disrespectful NN was here . ” Who MD invent a concept IN deliberately spraying pollution into the sky ? What kind of mind conceives an idea this horrible and VBZ to someone , “ Hey , we MD intentionally pollute the sky and make JJ clouds so that we can VB on polluting the NN with greenhouse gases for as RB as we VBP . We MD RB VB the weather ! ” What kind of NNS sit around the table in the planning room , nod their heads and reply , “ Say , that 's a swell idea ! ” ? Have n't these NNS ever gone hiking ? Have they ever paddled a canoe ? Are they NNS who do n't VB the silky feel of a baby 's hair beneath their fingertips ? Are they NNS who do n't VB the beauty in a NN 's smile when he crosses a finish line and can still breathe ? Or is the feeling of a paycheck being pressed into their palms the only thing that makes their heart race a little faster , or pulls their smile a little broader ? It is a beautiful plan , really . RB , we were all programmed to VB that only those who join the clubs , play for the team , fight for our country , or drink with the frat are “ normal ” . Those of us who crouched in the woods , dug in the dirt , collected pine cones , insects and objects other than shells on the beach were the weirdos . Most JJ beings attend ceremonies , follow traditions , perform rituals , stand in line , and fail to question because that is what has been expected of us all our lives . The television writes our script for existence in the modern NN . The newscasters tell us only what they 're permitted to say , and we are programmed to blindly accept only that which is “ officially ” published by certain “ credible ” institutions or academic authors . Enter the word that separates the crowd : “ Chemtrails ” . It is pulled out IN a hand puppet to create JJ exclusion . It manufactures instant division : the Us Team and the Them Team of the NN 's skywatchers . The Us Team thinks what is being done to the sky is insanity . We are watching the trees die from chemicals and lack of full sunlight . Some of us are aware of the raspy laugh or hoarse - sounding cough that had its onset when the spraying started above us . For others , the NN consequences have been worse . The Them Team is a mystery to me . Were they forced to wear bow ties at private school somewhere , to stand in line just a little too quietly when they wanted to run around on the playground instead ? When they were NNS , were they forced into submission by an overly stern parent ? Or are they just plain insane ? Who MD do this to our planet or VB along with doing it to the only NNP we have ? Who MD turn a blind eye to what is happening and instantly tack on the title “ Chemtrailer ” to every person who questions the blatant mess that is intentionally being created daily by jet aircraft ? What kind of person MD publish a NNS 's book , a movie , a photograph , or a computer game that subtly sells this concept by incorporating it into the artwork ? Who are these NNS , and how in the name of NNP did I end up on the same planet with them ? Several times a day , I VBP out and walk the circumference of my above - ground swimming pool , looking for bumble bees to save from drowning in the NN . Most of the NN I scoop them up with my bare hands because they seem to somehow VB I 'm there to VB . I place them as gently as I can onto the lavender plants and hope they can hear the others and recover . If they are faltering , I tell them they must try harder and I nudge them to flutter their wings so they will dry sooner . They are a gift . They are something the Them Team MD not understand . They were something I overlooked most of my NN until they disappeared . In the spring of 2013 , only a couple of weeks after I saw the JJ group of jets spray an aerosol haze above my house , the bumble bees vanished . Every other insect on our property soon disappeared as well . By August of that NN , the pool was devoid of insects and the porch light glowed moth - free , a ghostly reminder of what was being destroyed . I knew it was the trails . But I am just a “ chemtrailer ” . What do I VB ? The Them Team has used their JJ exclusion tactics to draw a line in the sand so they can VB on about the business of lying or denying . I VBP it 's some of both , and I VBP the NNS on that team have JJ different agendas . By pulling out the label and plastering it around , some of them VBP to stand on a tiny pedestal and do what I call The Academic Chuckle when they deem it appropriate . They VBP to publicly make fun of thousands of NNS who have eyes they trust and NNS they are concerned about . They VBP to destroy the NN while pretending they 're saving it , and hundreds of NNS are VBG RB along with them by not having the scrotal fortitude to stand up to them and their ready - made label . ( Politicians are included in this JJ list of cowards . ) Geoengineering is happening . The NN is manipulating the weather . Very wealthy NNS and corrupt corporations have a tremendous amount to gain from pushing California into a drought . Giant pharmaceutical NNS are making millions on NNS with depressed immune systems and asthma . Welcome to America , everyone . Land of the oblivious , home of the cowardly . This is why the Them Team is getting away with it . NNS VBP to be part of something . They do n't VB to face JJ exclusion . They do n't VB to be ridiculed . They do n't VB to hear the Academic Chuckle and be on the wrong side of it . But there was a NN when most of the NN thought the NN was JJ and NNS who thought it was round were laughed at , a NN when Galileo was punished for his views on heliocentrism . Rachel Carson was publicly ridiculed when she warned of the dangers of DDT . Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was scorned for his suggestion that doctors wash their hands in a sanitizing solution before delivering babies in order to prevent childbed fever ; and Louis Pasteur 's ideas were met with skepticism . What aspect of the JJ mind makes it so resistant to JJ concepts , so unable to rise to the challenge of facing existing problems ? How hard is it to look up at the sky and VB what is happening ? How hard is it to VB that the trees are dying ? If I cared what other NNS thought , I MD n't be writing this . Oh , sure , we all do to an extent , but there are some of us who were just born to pour the poison Kool - Aid down the drain and say , “ Not for me ! ” When I was four NNS old , I went to nursery school in a section of the NNP NNP Methodist Church , and I knew what was beyond the door in the baby room . It led into the rest of the building and ultimately to the church sanctuary . Every so often , my grandmother MD drag me reluctantly to Sunday services and feed me pink mint candy to keep me quiet , so I remembered seeing the sanctuary with its silky blue cushions and looming stained - glass windows . I was determined to find my NN to it . I convinced about four other kids to join the caper . We sneaked through the nursery room door and skipped through the dark warren of hallways until we came to the light , and we exploded with giggles in that lofty , enormous room . Without a congregation , it had a beautiful dreamlike quality and it never occurred to me that I was breaking a rule . I only knew that I was on adventure and we had reached our destination . The punishment turned out to be better than the crime itself , for we were sentenced to VB prepare lunches in the deepest , darkest part of the church with Mrs. Brezina for a week straight . She was the kindest jailer imaginable and her kitchen was tucked into a forgotten grotto that was as interesting as it was neglected . Those of us who recruit others to sneak off to find a beautiful place that resides in our memory are the kinds of NNS who do n't join clubs . We follow only rules that matter and we step out of line . Out of curiosity we play with the NN squirter in the dentist chair when nobody is looking . We VBP for ourselves . We became accustomed RB ago to being called names because we 've always been different , so as a tactic of psychological manipulation , calling us names does n't really work . The Them Team can try as hard as it wants to . It 's not VBG to VB us down and make us VB , “ Good heavens , someone is disdainfully lumping us into a category so we 'd better shut up and VB on about the business of fitting in . ” Did Rachel Carson try to fit in ? Semmelweis ? Galileo ? No , they did what they thought was JJ despite extreme opposition by their peers . They might not have had happy endings , but they all played a significant role in exposing the NN . There was brilliance in contorting the word “ chemtrails ” so that it immediately triggers an emotional response in certain NNS . It has bought the Them Team NN . In just CD syllables it creates an obstacle . For NNS who VBP in the established order of things , still VBP our NN is working for the greater good , and do n't VB to buck the system , there is that word IN a comfortable old jacket ready to be slipped on to protect them from the NN : “ The chemtrail NNS must be wrong because they are associated with a detestable word that makes them sound nuts . ” And then they pull the jacket around them a little tighter . It is a convenient NN out . Score CD for the Them Team . They just got more NN to carry on with their nasty deeds . JJ behavior is baffling . When did NNS become so out of touch with the natural NN that they can't look up at the sky and VB that things are just not JJ ? When did seemingly intelligent NNS lose their ability to use reason ? NNS are “ proposing ” the very thing we are witnessing , and yet NNS are letting themselves be manipulated by CD simple CD - syllable word so that they are completely unable to VB the NN hiding in plain sight . The reality is , if our planetary situation is so dire that spraying a layer of pollution into the NN is our only hope , NNS need to VB . And if spraying aerosols into the NN is putting millions of dollars into the pockets of big businesses and allowing NNS to keep polluting for the almighty dollar , NNS need to VB . If our governments are manipulating the weather , whatever the reason , NNS need to VB . There is no Us Team and Them Team . We are all riding on a relatively small ship in a very big universe , and it 's dangerously close to sinking and taking us with it . That JJ tendency to VB there is a big fix , that we can pull out all the stops in the end and save the day , is just wrong . We can't . It 's NN for everyone to face what is happening because , at this point , the NN is our only hope ."

Rubino explains , “ The coming monetary reset and what that means for gold and what that means for the rest of the JJ financial system , you do n’t need a war to bring that about because we are making enough financial mistakes that will VB us there in no NN JJ now without geopolitical turmoil . If you add a big war in the Middle East into the equation , then anything can happen . A scenario RB now that is very , very feasible is we start shooting in the Middle East and Russia and China is on the other side of this in CD NN or another . They VBP Iran , and we have our allies helping us , and we start using these next generation weapons that are breathtakingly powerful . Nobody has any idea what ’s VBG to happen when we start throwing these things at each other . . . . Oil spikes to $ 100 – $ 150 per barrel , and that tips the already extremely fragile JJ financial system over the edge . So , we VBP the ‘ Greater Depression ’ or the monetary reset or a hyperinflation or whatever we VBP sooner rather than later . It ’s a disaster for everybody when it happens that NN . ” Rubino VBZ the monetary masters “ tried to fix the financial system but MD not do it . ” Rubino VBZ , “ If you VBP you are beyond the point of no return financially as an individual , you borrow as much money as you can , and then VB bankrupt . . . . Governments in the NN are starting to do that now or behaving that NN . . . . There is nothing they can do to fix the system . In the U.S. , they tried to fix the system and scale RB and they VBD out that is impossible . The central bank in the U.S. cannot raise interest rates without the economy collapsing . . . . So , they basically gave up . . . . They are printing a lot of currency electronically and dumping it into the banking system . . . . The consequence for the currency is to make it less valuable NN after NN . . . then you VBP the crackup boom . . . where NNS just lose faith in the currency because they VBP the NN is VBG to make it less valuable NN after NN . So , there is no point in holding that currency as savings . They spend it as fast as they VBP it . ” In closing , Rubino VBZ , “ We have entered a JJ stage which feels IN CD of the end stages of this process — when governments just give up and do n’t RB pretend to try and VB their finances anymore . Well , we are there . That ’s when it will be clear to everybody that is the case , and then your gold goes through the roof . The investment thesis ends with you loading up on precious metals and then riding the inflation and / or monetary reset that has to happen because of past mistakes . . . . The nightmare scenario is if we are already having a financial crisis and then we have a war with China and Russia , it ’s unimaginable . I cannot factor that into a scenario for financial asset prices because it is too crazy . ” Join Greg Hunter of USAWatchdog.com as he goes CD - on - CD with John Rubino , founder of DollarCollapse.com .

""_''","As this decade comes to an end , there have been quite a few moments that NNS have hoped and prayed had never happened . While these ' NN - in - mouth ' moments have numbered in the hundreds and thousands in this decade itself , we 've rounded up ten of the choicest moments , some of them quite embarrassing for those concerned . This list of ten moments includes not just personalities in India and across the NN , but RB certain events that have had a number of consequences for those involved . Here is a list of this decade 's most ' NN - in - mouth ' moments , in descending order : JJ - earthers are those who VBP , simply , that the NN is not round , but JJ . No matter the evidence given , JJ - earthers do not recognise the NN to be an oblate - spheroid , to use the terminology NNS have given to the planet 's shape . This movement has been around for a JJ NN , but has grown in popularity with the rise of JJ NN and NN theories . The movement has RB attracted a few celebrities to ridicule or support the movement . In 2017 , a rapper from the US started a GoFundMe page to crowdfund satellites to prove the NN was JJ . 9. Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan 's goof - ups on ' Koffee With Karan ' Bollywood celebrities Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan probably wished they MD have brushed up on their general knowledge before slipping up on filmmaker Karan Johar 's show , ' Koffee With Karan ' . On being asked who the NNP of the country was , Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan VBD ' Prithviraj Chavan ' and ' Manmohan Singh ' respectively . Both celebrities were massively trolled online for their answers and were the laughing stock of JJ NN users for quite a JJ NN . 8. Fyre Festival and the ' sad ' but viral cheese sandwich The Fyre Festival promised to be a modern - day Woodstock , with the festival 's organisers doubling down on the lavish promise of a grand music festival on an exotic island filled with food , drinks , music , luxurious bungalows to stay in and famous supermodels . Rich NNS who MD afford the extravagant price tag , upwards of $ 10,000 , flocked to the island , located in the Bahamas , only to be greeted with torrential rain a day before the festival was to kick off , small tents with dirty mattresses and ... CD breads with a cheese slice , tomato slices and lettuce leaves for food . A photo of the ' sad ' cheese sandwich went viral on JJ NN and marked the beginning of the end of festival . After a user posted the photo of the cheese sandwich , NN of the disaster that was the Fyre Festival broke out and went viral on JJ NN . CD of the festival 's organisers Billy McFarland , was convicted of fraud , while the other , famous rapper Ja Rule , distanced himself from the festival . JJ soft drink brand Pepsi hoped to capitalise on the anti-establishment fervour in 2017 , with an advertisement featuring celebrity socialite Kendall Jenner cutting across protestors and offering a policeman a can of Pepsi . With the ' Black Lives Matter ' protests that had sparked in the US , the ad provoked an outcry and was widely derided on JJ NN . Bernice King , the daughter of civil rights activist Martin Luther King , wrote a scathing response to the ad on NNP : "" If only Daddy MD have VBN about the power of # Pepsi , "" with a picture of her father being pushed by a police officer . Union Minister Piyush Goyal became the centre of attention on JJ NN in September this NN while commenting on the NN of the economy . Mr Goyal , while defending the NN 's handling of the economy , VBD "" If you 're looking at a five trillion dollar economy , the country will have to grow at 12 % . Today it 's growing at 6 % . Do n't VB into those maths . Those maths have never helped Einstein discover gravity ... If you 'd only gone by structured formulae and what was past knowledge , I do n't VB there MD have been any innovation in this NN "" . JJ NN was quick to point out that it was Isaac Newton and not Albert Einstein who discovered gravity . After being derided for the remarks on JJ NN , the minister VBD that some "" sought to remove the context , pick up CD line and create a very mischievous narrative . "" ' Alternative facts ' was a phrase famously coined by US NNP Donald NNP 's then White House advisor Kellyanne Conway . The phrase was coined after NNP 's former White House press secretary Sean Spicer 's alleged false statement on the number of NNS who had attended NNP 's inauguration ceremony . Conway used the term to justify Spicer 's claim that a JJ number of NNS had attended the ceremony , whereas photographic evidence proved otherwise . Donald NNP has been notorious for his comments on NN NN , including his recent barbs aimed at NN NN activist , 16 - NN - old Greta Thunberg . "" The concept of JJ warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive , "" NNP had tweeted in 2012 . In another tweet , NNP VBD that JJ warming was needed because it was freezing and snowing in NNP York . Elon Musk stoked controversy last NN , when the incident involving several NNS being trapped inside a cave in Thailand made headlines the NN over , saw the tech billionaire play a role in rescue attempts as well . Following a disagreement with Vernon Unsworth , a British diver involved in rescuing the NNS , Elon Musk in a tweet , called him a "" pedo guy "" . Unsworth had described Musk 's proposal to build a mini-submarine to rescue the NNS as a "" PR stunt "" . The comment has proved to be costly for Musk , with an ensuing lawsuit as well as several clarifications issued by him . As recently as this month , Musk 's attorney Alex Spiro VBD "" pedo guy "" meant "" creepy old guy "" in South Africa , in a bid at damage NN . Former Junior Education Minister Satyapal Singh had last NN claimed that the NN of evolution put forth by naturalist Charles Darwin was "" scientifically wrong "" . "" Ever since humans came to NNP , they have always been humans , "" he had VBN , adding that "" Nobody , including our ancestors , have VBN or written that they ever saw an ape turning into a JJ being . No book we have read or the tales VBN to us by our grandparents had any such mention "" . The comments provoked a sharp reaction from Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who in a harsh rebuke to his partymen , had VBN that "" we make mistakes and give ' masala ' to the NN ... as if we are great JJ NNS and experts to analyse issues ... the moment you VBP a camera you start speaking . So this half - baked stuff is picked up "" . The Indian Army in April this NN , tweeted that it had spotted "" mysterious footprints of the mythical beast Yeti "" , RB VBN as the ' abominable snowman ' . The army shared photos on NNP claiming that a mountaineering expedition team had VBN the Yeti's "" mysterious footprints measuring 32X15 inches "" . In the images , the prints appear to be of a single NN . NNS soon called for more credible proof before citing claims over the mythical beast , with CD scientist telling NDTV that the finding by the army be "" best left as amateur speculation that needs to be debated further "" . JJ NN did n't take too kindly over the army 's claim either , with several users mocking it online . "" MD n't you guys call a single animal expert before posting this ? "" CD person wrote , with another asking if it was a "" prank "" . Yet another user mocked the image of the single footprint , saying that the beast "" travels by jumping . """

Louie Franz and Jamie Mathew Sutherland were having dinner in the NNP Zealand town of Queenstown and arguing about the planet ’s true shape when they made a $ 10,000 NZD ( £ 5,000 ) wager about who was JJ . Mr Franz – a believer in the widely discredited JJ NNP NN NN – VBD they shook hands on the bet about whether the NN was JJ before Mr Sutherland – a believer in NN – immediately demanded payment . The dispute was eventually argued out in court after Mr Sutherland was charged by police for threatening to shoot his friend and his friend ’s father at a petrol station , according to the Otago Daily Times . The JJ NNP believer VBD the Queenstown District Court judge : “ [ He VBD ] ‘ If you do n’t pay it I ’ll VB a crossbow , I ’ll shoot you and your father , put you in the trunk and they ’ll never VB you again ’ . ” The strange case began CD months prior to the alleged threat made in February .

Mr Sutherland ’s defence lawyer reportedly VBD Mr Lanz had been “ adamant ” in his belief the NNP was JJ , but later changed his mind on the issue .

I_PRP rest_VBP my_PRP$ caboose_NN ._.","I 'm always amazed what simpletons some brainy folks are . Once we regular folks leave college for the real NN , we realize college graduates with numerous awards and diplomas are only smarter by degrees but not necessarily wiser . And common sense is not all that common . And Men of Letters often have no practical experience -- aside from reading letters from other men IN themselves . The average farmer working his field must calculate the gallons per hour his diesel tractor consumes . Applied NN rather than theoretical NN . If he tills a square mile of land , 640 acres , he realizes his tractor engine consumes more fuel at a higher RPM and the engine works harder but nor more efficiently , and so he sets his speed according . Applied NN again when the farmer applies it in the field . Recently , some British poll determined a linguistic professor at MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology - was the smartest intellectual in the NN . Allegedly the guy has written a couple hundred books . This fellow was so deep , CD of the "" most cited "" authorities in the NN , that whatever he VBD entered the realm of fact . Funny how an institution - Yale or MIT - can build a reputation for braininess but closer inspection indicates that lofty reputation is wholly undeserved . The average farmer tilling his land appears smarter by comparison . He applies his knowledge in the field , rather than simply positing theories that hold little merit when examined closely . Now MIT , IN Yale NNP , is a huge , NN funded and privately supported , NN tank . Sort of IN the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) or AIPAC , a couple of institutes that allegedly foster friendly foreign relations but which any objective observer MD be hard pressed to explain just how they benefit the average American taxpayer . Likewise , Yale NNP : College of Criminal Arts , ranks among the most prestigious universities for brainy NNS but when you consider the yokels and hucksters and scalawags who have matriculated there "" both Bush and NNP clans as well as that doofus Kerry -- any objective observer might deduce Yale 's reputation for braininess was wholly undeserved . Awhile RB , a number of MIT brains , including that institute 's top "" intellectual "" deduced that 911 was simply what the NN claimed it was : An act of terrorism wholly perpetrated by fanatics from the Middle East . Indeed , that top intellectual authored a book of his brainy interviews on the subject entitled "" 9 - 11 . "" A hasty little compilation , the booklet hardly mentioned any of details of the attack . Instead , ignoring basic Core Evidence , "" 9 - 11 "" blamed American policies for the attack , but without mentioning the more intellectually challenging possibility : The attack was wholly or partially the brainchild of "" intellectuals "" much closer to home . Immediately after 911 , a number of structural engineers gathered at the NN - funded institute of MIT and - surprise , surprise - affirmed the NN version of events about 911 . "" The main culprits in bringing the famously lofty buildings down , they concluded , were the CD intensely hot infernos , "" summarized Scientific American writer , Steve Ashley . "" The NNP Trade Center was never designed for the massive explosions nor the intense jet fuel fires that came next - a key design omission , "" according to Eduardo Kausel , M.I.T. professor of civil and JJ engineering and panel member . The towers collapsed , allegedly , after the kerosene jet fuel fire weakened high tensile steel . These "" scientific "" conclusions then appeared in the Scientific American magazine : NNP & Technology at Scientific American , "" When the Twin Towers Fell "" . Unfortunately , little of the structural steel in the WTC was examined , however , by the learned structural engineers . Beams and girders were instead shipped overseas for hasty recycling . Nor did any structural engineer comment on actual photos of the alleged "" inferno . "" Might have been difficult for them to explain how a woman Walked Through Steel - Melting Fire . Now this MIT symposium , reminded me of a meeting of the NNP - NNP society , where believers hoisted their yardsticks above their heads and proclaimed they , d measured the surrounding countryside inch - by - inch and VBD it JJ , thus the NNP was JJ . The MIT structural engineers concluded their scientific symposium almost by a show of hands , or popular vote ! "" Given the lack of firm conclusions regarding how the collapses occurred , ( since all the evidence was conveniently destroyed ) the M.I.T. panel participants asked their audience to consider various theories they put forth . "" In short , they admitted , after expending hours of hot air , that they didn, t VB what - the - hell happened ! So instead of applying hard NN , they applied NN . Since their NN had hastily carted off all the factual , hard evidence that might have conflicted with "" scientific "" NN , they drew conclusions based on conjecture ! So , instead of building a forty - NN , scale model ( 1/25 scale ) of the boxy skyscrapers , WTC - 1 , WTC - 2. WTC - 7 , and shooting an aluminum scale model airplane into the upper floors of building 1 & 2 at 400 miles per hour , and setting fire to that section with a few gallons ( more or less ) of kerosene , they simply dissected the blueprints , inspected some computerized images of floor joints , hypothesized that "" intensely hot infernos "" caused joist connections to fail , and delivered their conclusions to the modern NNP NNP society at MIT via the pages of the Scientific American . Morons In Training . Any metallurgist from a community college , with a modicum of field NN and a curiosity about how things work , MD construct a ten NN ( 1/100 scale ) model of the WTC - 7 , set a few smoldering fires in the lower floors and film the results . And absolutely nothing MD happen ! Not today , not tomorrow and not next NN . Instead , that scale model of a 47 - NN , steel skyscraper , ( WTC - 7 ) , that allegedly collapsed due to the "" stress of intense heat "" MD remain as inflexible as the gray matter in the brains of those MIT NNS . Unfortunately , our Morons In Training at MIT , which is only another NN - funded NN tank , feel no need to conduct honest , real NN tests , since they do not live in the real NN . They live in a NN of illusions and NN - funded , computer - generated propaganda . Pathetic . Philosopher and skeptic , Douglas Herman authored the definitive philosophical - suspense novel , The Guns of Dallas and writes for Rense . WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME ? Which is the standard call of all college students these days . Let 's begin with the JJ question , "" So What ? "" So what is the big deal here ? Is this something which is JJ ? College students , RB the brains , have no experience . This is true of all college grads , Ph.D. , MBA , M.O.U.S.E. , Physics , whatever . It 's the experience which makes them VB everything . It 's the experience which comes after exposure to the reality of practicing their trade , using their degree . A college degree , no matter the size or shape , presents the basic knowledge base upon which a NN or woman MD learn from experience . Nothing JJ here . OK , OK , so I 'll VB to the point of others hanging on every word . Later . For the NN being , let 's discuss question number CD . Who Cares ? Not me . You VBP , I 've had to deal with JJ a degreed primadonna during my career . When I consulted for a firm recently , there was a very brilliant MBA assigned by the firm 's owners and board of directors , to my client . He was cocky , he was arrogant and he was almost always wrong . After a period of perhaps nine or so months , every decision I made , he countered . So , I resigned . The NN of the firm called me RB and VBD me I had full authority within the purview of my field , which was marketing . OK fine . The business more than doubled in less than CD NNS . But did I make the "" kid "" as we called him , look bad ? Hell no . I made the decisions , and I required that he , the kid , implement them . He learned . I learned . The owners learned . Everyone was happy . I met the kid in court about seven NNS ago . We were both paid expert witnesses . I went on RB . I waited with bated breath for the kid to counter every darned thing I VBD . I was both surprised and happy to hear him agree with everything to which I testified . What 's in it for me ? Easy . That 's the cry of the JJ college grad . When I graduated with a degree in EE and got my JJ job at Grumman in 1966 , I was paid the then high salary of almost ten thousand dollars . Yikes . Today , the kids are paid minimum four times that if they 're in the top ten percentile of their graduating class . Add a few more degrees and they will , with a Ph.D. in EE , pull down over a hundred thousand dollars in their JJ job . Can you imagine what they 'll be earning when this country goes to hell in a hand basket ? Give us six or seven NNS and these kids will be making up to three and a half yards a * week ! * A yard being a thousand dollars . Now let us VB RB to the writer 's main point . We give these kids credence . Well , that 's quite so . But those who give these kids credence are * not* in the mainstream of practical application of the kids ' expertise . They are likely in academia . Or they are in awe of those in academia . What 's the point ? Well , hell 's bell 's it 's RB theren staring you in the face if you just look . Ooops ! You will require the services of a mirror . I almost forgot . Here , do this in remembrance of me ... Take a mirror , a hand mirror . Make IN you are VBG to inspect your hair . You VBP , for fallout and stuff ? OK . Now look RB on top of that head of yours . What do you VB ? I VBP what I VBP . I VBP a point . VB my point ? RB there on the top of your head .

According to Disney , the series centers around a teenage girl named Luz who “ discovers a portal to another realm where humans are not well - liked , and she must disguise herself in order to fit in at witch school . ” This realm , the kids programming empire VBZ , is referred to as “ Demon town , ” and in it Luz decides to live with a demon named Eda the Owl Lady who ’s “ the most powerful witch on the Boiling Iles . ” Luz ’s character decides during CD of the earlier episodes of the show that , “ Someday , I ’m VBG to be just IN her ” – meaning Luz wants to grow up not to be an honorable JJ woman , but rather a demon witch IN Eda . The purpose of this storyline , of course , is to teach NNS whose parents let them watch The Disney Channel that being normal JJ beings is passé , and that it ’s “ cool ” to discover portals that carry you off to hell to live with demons , witches , and RB Satan himself . “ Folks , if you VBP this latest ‘ Owl House ’ show is just ‘ fantasy and fun ’ VB again , ” reads a commentary written by Deborah Bunting for CBN ( The Christian Broadcasting Network ) . “ The show tries to portray witchcraft as a positive tool to fight evil , ” she goes on to explains . “ That ’s similar to what real - NN witches have been promoting over the past few NNS as they ’ve been putting hexes on NNP NNP and others in order to fight for their beliefs . ” Sponsored solution from the NNP Ranger Store : The Big Berkey NN filter removes almost 100 % of all contaminants using only the power of gravity ( no electricity needed , works completely off - grid ) . Widely consider the ultimate "" survival "" NN filter , the Big Berkey is made of stainless steel and has been laboratory verified for high - efficiency removal of heavy metals by CWC Labs , with tests personally conducted by Mike Adams . Explore more here . If you let your NNS watch The Disney Channel , you ’re paving their NN straight to hell JJ parents are simply unaware of this filth being peddled by Disney and The Disney Channel because they assume that the network resembles the Disney programming of old , which on its NN was clean and wholesome . In NN , Disney is actively indoctrinating NN viewers into Satanism , using cartoon imaging as the lure . “ Over the NNS , Disney has gone farther and farther into the darkness of the spiritual NN that opposes the living NNP , coming up with programming and characters that lead the vulnerable into that dark NN of deception , ” Bunting further warns . “ This spiritual realm that opposes NNP is real . Demons are real . ” “ And they are out to deceive your NNS and draw them in to be pawns of the enemy of their souls , the Devil , otherwise VBN as Satan , ” she adds . “ His devices and plans are to destroy your kids and grandkids spiritually , physically and emotionally . You must protect them from being enticed into this demonic NN . ” Adam Hirsh , CD of the voice actors on The Owl House , reportedly VBD Newsweek during a recent interview that the original pitch for the show was “ girl hangs out with witch in hell . ” Since most parents probably MD n’t VB for this , however , the network had to VB creative . It ’s a lot IN the Harry Potter book series , which is geared towards NNS with fun adventures , colorful storylines , and tailored writing specifically for little ears . But behind this thin façade is a NN of darkness and depravity that sucks NNS in and consumes their souls . “ As ridiculous as the ‘ demons ’ contained in the book MD be , there is nothing innocent or fun about RB pretending to summon evil spirits , ” VBZ Elizabeth Johnston , RB VBN as “ Activist Mommy ” on her blog . “ But who is to say it is pretend ? The spirit NN is real and is no laughing matter . ” A notable exorcist RB VBD LifeSiteNews that this JJ Disney show is “ a sign of the degeneration of our society , ” which is pushing to make demons “ acceptable ” while ignoring “ their malice and desire to do us harm . ” For more related NN about Disney and the rise of Satanism in America , read Satanism.news ."

The globe - imaging software Google NNP has become a cult web product since its release last June . Using the web - based tool , users can fly around the globe and zoom in on both natural features and whole worlds of NN added by other users ( VB <?xm- replace_text_FW ?>' The web - wide NN ' ) . But how is it possible for you to zoom in from outer NN to a point somewhere above the rooftop of your house without bringing your desktop computer to a grinding halt ? The main obstacle to a convincing three - diménsional skydive is data transfer . If CD were to download over the Internet a CD - metre resolution image of the entire NN it MD take 69 NNS with a 10 - megabit - per- second Internet connection , and 12,400 NNS with a standard 56 K modem . To slash the amount of data they have to transmit across the Internet , virtual globes such as Google NNP approximate the sphere of the planet 's NN with a polygon made up of JJ tiles . The further away your viewpoint is from the NN , the fewer tiles are needed to create the illusion of roundness , and the lower the resolution of these tiles can be . As you zoom in , the computer explodes each tile into smaller sub-tiles , each with higher resolution , and re-forms the polygon into a ball . The process continues as you zoom . This means that the virtual globe only has to download high - resolution data when the viewer is actively zooming towards it . Virtual globes RB use another trick to speed <? xm - replace_text_NN ?> things up further : a disk cache . Images for places you have already looked at are stored locally on your hard drive , so when you fly over this area again the software does not need to re-download the images , but instead quickly calls them up from your hard disk . Google NNP was designed by Keyhole , a software NN that Google bought in 2004 . JJ of the tricks it uses are n't unique : the tiling idea has been used by NN modellers , for example . But with good software and the speed of Google 's enormous supercomputing platform , the results are impressive .

To find those opportunities , look at markets and performance under a microscope . For example , a JJ industrial NN suffered stagnant growth until a highly granular market analysis identified 4,000 growth pockets with $ 10 billion in revenue potential . • Identify micro-segments of customers , geographic regions , and products where performance is increasing . • Invest resources ( R&D , advertising mix ) in areas with the strongest growth momentum , and jettison low - growth areas . • Restructure your organization to focus on the expanded number of growth priorities . For example , assign each micro-segment its own accountable leader . Some NNS will need an executive team of 200 or more to lead JJ product clusters or geographic slivers . A closer look at how to grow your business through a more granular approach : Plot each of your NN ’s $ 50 – $ 200 million growth opportunities ( “ pockets ” ) on a CD - dimensional graph — a “ heat map . ” The y - axis represents market growth ; the x - axis , market share compared with competitors ’ . Use circles to represent each pocket , and color code them to indicate in which of your NN ’s divisions or units the opportunity lies ; size the circles to show the relative value of the business your NN currently does in each pocket . Once you ’ve used your heat map to gain a more detailed view of your business , start managing your business in a more granular NN : Invest the lion ’s share of your resources in the areas with strong market share and growth . Draw on insights about where growth pockets will be , not where they are now ( for instance , GE announced that by 2010 , it MD be investing $ 1.5 billion annually in renewable - NN businesses . ) Beef up your M&A capabilities so you can quickly move into a high - growth market NN through a targeted acquisition . Jettison low - growth businesses in unattractive market spaces . NNS ’ usual inner circle ( CEO , unit heads , sales and functional leaders ) is n’t JJ enough to make all the where - to - compete choices that arise every day . So devolve responsibility for the pursuit of fine - grained opportunities to your 200 - plus top leaders . These individuals might lead product clusters , geographic slivers , or special initiatives . They ’ll focus your organization on important growth opportunities , while inspiring and motivating relatively small teams who ’ll develop a strong sense of ownership . But to manage the resulting complexity , ensure members of your extended leadership team fully understand how their individual goals fit with the NN ’s strategic priorities . Make certain they ’re well versed in granular measurement approaches , such as the market heat map . During regular operations reviews , push the conversation beyond high - level financial and operating numbers for a business ’s multiple product lines and markets . Dig down into the underlying drivers of growth and profitability in the different component businesses . Ask questions such as : • How is each growth driver changing ? • How likely is each component business to win in its market ? • Do resources need to be reallocated ? • Is it NN to exit a market ?"

The title was a play on his 2004 documentary “ Fahrenheit 9/11 ” that sought to expose mishandlings in NNP George W. Bush ’s White House following the attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 . The latest film , as Fox NNP previously reported , sought to do the same to NNP NNP at a key NN for the country : the 2018 midterm elections . “ Fahrenheit 11/9 ” took in $ 3.1 million in 1,719 cinemas — a JJ debut for most documentaries but a fraction of the $ 23.9 million opening of “ Fahrenheit 9/11 . ” That film went on to make $ 222.4 million worldwide , a record for documentaries . Moore ’s JJ film , which examines the rise of NNP and other developments IN the NN crisis in his hometown of Flint , Mich . , had been predicted to open with $ 5 million to $ 8 million , but did n't RB come close . This , despite a surge in success for documentaries at the box office in the past few months , including “ RBG , ” ‘‘ Wo n’t You Be My Neighbor ” and “ Three Identical Strangers . ” “ Fahrenheit 11/9 , ” the JJ release from former Open Road chief executive Tom Ortenberg ’s JJ distributor , Briarcliff Entertainment , MD have decent weeks ahead leading up to the November elections . ComScore ’s PostTrak survey VBD that 82 percent of viewers gave it four out of five stars . It landed an “ A ” CinemaScore . “ Those who did VB it really enjoyed it , ” VBD Paul Dergarabedian , senior NN analyst for comScore . “ NNS have VBN : Should they have gone limited ? Should they have gone wide ? I VBP they needed to VB it out there nationwide with midterms six weeks away . But it ’s very easy to second - guess how to release a documentary IN this . It ’s CD of the most difficult types of films to release . ” Last month , Moore , whose 2002 documentary “ Bowling for Columbine ” won an Oscar , made headlines when the trailer for “ Fahrenheit 11/ 9 ” referred to NNP as “ the last NN of the NNP NNPS . ” The anti-Trump filmmaker sat down with MSNBC ’s Chris Hayes , who asked Moore about the bold claim . “ I VBP it ’s possible , absolutely . I VBP that we have someone in the White House who has no respect for the rule of law , who dislikes democracy by an incredible degree , which does n’t make him really any that much different from other billionaires or CEOs because their businesses are not democracies , ” Moore responded . Moore VBD NNS IN NNP “ rule by fiat ” and do n’t VB when other NNS have a voice in their decision - making . “ They RB VBP to take home the bulk of the money with them . So this is — putting somebody IN that in charge of a democracy is a very dangerous thing , and especially , it ’s more dangerous with him because he has a complete lack of ideology , ” Moore VBD Hayes . The gothic family fantasy “ The House With a Clock in Its Walls ” exceeded expectations to debut with an estimated $ 26.9 million in ticket sales at the weekend box office . It was easily the biggest draw on a quiet weekend at North American movie theaters , where the other JJ wide releases all disappointed or downright flopped . Dan Fogelman ’s “ NN Itself ” and the home invasion thriller “ Assassination Nation ” both barely made a blip in nationwide release . Though Fogelman ’s “ This Is Us ” is CD of TV ’s top-rated series , his “ NNP Itself ” bombed with $ 2.1 million despite a starry cast including Olivia Wilde , Oscar Isaac and Antonio Banderas .

This NN is given by a closed - form mathematical expression , so that it is mathematically simple and can be applied easily . Moreover , since the asymptotic NN includes sphericity and vertical structure effects , it is physically more reasonable than the JJ - NNP NN . A comparison between results calculated by three dislocation theories ( the JJ - NNP NN , the NN for a spherical NNP and its asymptotic solution ) shows that the true co-seismic geoid NNS are approximated better by the asymptotic results than by those of a JJ NNP .

And so it does come with trade - offs . For example , how do you define something authoritative across the broad swath of NNP when JJ of the use NNS , as you VBP , are outside of the NN - seeking realm ? They ’re entertainment , they ’re oftentimes driven by NNS ’s personal tastes , IN music and comedy and the JJ .

Since the NNP Zealand shooting , we ’ve heard this question about “ Well , the platforms worked together to take down ISIS content . Why have n’t they done the same for white supremacy or violent JJ - wing extremism ? ” What ’s the answer there ? The JJ thing that I MD say , just as a matter of fact , is that there were CD sets of challenges when it came to the NNP Zealand shooting . CD was everything that we just talked about in terms of surfacing authoritative , high - quality NN — not showing , you VBP , conspiracies or harmful misinformation . That was CD bucket . The other bucket had to do with the velocity at which re-uploads were coming to these various platforms , and that is an area where we collaborated . We worked closely with other platforms in terms of making sure we had fingerprints of these videos , just IN they did , and we shared those . The other thing I MD say , just more generally , in the case of violent extremism and limiting those videos on the platform , the reason it ’s different than what we ’re talking about here is that those [ ISIS ] videos took on a particular form . They were often designed for propaganda purposes and recruitment purposes . So they had things IN branding and logos , both visually and in terms of the music they might use . Those formed a set of finite clues we MD use to bring that content down . And , of course , we collaborated with other platforms to do that ."

The station will then have a JJ service area in which little fading is experienced . The demand for NN on the design of such an aerial has given rise in recent NNS to some theoretical and experimental investigations on the general properties of antennas used in radio transmitting stations . A JJ and useful contribution to the NN of knowledge on this subject has recently been given by Prof. P. O. Pcdersen in a booklet published ( in English ) in Copenhagen ( “ Radiation from a Vertical Antenna over NNP Perfectly Conducting NNP . ” Pp. 49 + 35 figures . G. E. C. Gad : Vimmelskaftet 32 , Copenhagen . Kr. 6.00 ) . This work comprises a theoretical investigation of the radiation characteristics of a vertical antenna over Hat perfectly conducting NN , having for its objective a determination of the most suitable dimensions of the antenna at the JJ Copenhagen broadcasting station . The theoretical results have been checked by measurements of the distribution of the current in the antenna and of the field intensity at various distances from the station . To facilitate the theoretical analysis , the current distribution in the transmitting antenna is in the JJ case assumed to be sinusoidal , although it was VBN that this is not valid in the practical case . The complete general formulas for the radiated field for an antenna are obtained , and a most useful series of tables and graphs are provided , from which the radiation resistance and the distribution of the radiated field in the vertical plane MD be calculated for antenna ; of various dimensions ."

This is exemplified by multiple discoveries within the realms of quantum physics , parapsychology , and more — discoveries that have challenged ( and continue to challenge ) the current framework of accepted scientific knowledge . This kind of shift in ideology has happened JJ times over the course of our history ; when the NN instantaneously became round from JJ , the majority of NNS were in disbelief and labelled the JJ NN ’s proponents as blasphemers . Some great examples of NN that challenge these current and JJ held belief systems include : quantum entanglement , studies which examine the role of consciousness on physical systems ( IN the quantum double slit experiment ) , placebo studies , distant healing , and more . Another great example is teleportation , as several interesting findings within this field seem to be ( at least partly ) turning NN fiction into NN fact . The title asserts that he teleported DNA . It seems , as with other “ fringe ” topics when it comes to NN , phenomena IN this receives harsh criticism and resistance from a still decent sized part of NN . That being VBN , did he really teleport DNA ? Given his reputation and credibility , combined with all of the studies done in various types of teleportation , the black budget and more , I am VBG to give him the benefit of the doubt . Nobel Prize winning scientist Luc Montagnier , previously VBN for his work on HIV and AIDS , claims to have demonstrated that DNA can be generated from its teleported “ quantum imprint . ” This is a discovery that , were the scientific community to VB on board , MD represent “ the most significant experiments performed in the past 90 NNS , demanding re-evaluation of the whole conceptual framework of modern chemistry , ” ( source ) according to theoretical chemist Jeff Reimers of the NNP of Sydney , Australia . In the experiment , CD adjacent but physically separate test tubes were placed within a copper coil and subjected to a very low frequency electromagnetic field of 7 hertz . The apparatus was isolated from NNP ’s natural magnetic field so there was no interference . CD tube contained a fragment of DNA ( approximately 100 bases JJ ) and the second NN contained nothing but NN . ( source ) ( source ) ( source ) ( source ) After approximately 17 hours , the gene fragment ( according to Montagnier ) was recovered from both tubes , RB though PRP should have just contained NN . Although Montagnier ’s claims have received harsh criticism from various NNS , there was a general consensus that his results should be investigated further . For example , Giuseppe Vitiello , of the NNP of Salemo in Italy , is confident that the experiment is reliable . Greg Scholes , from the NNP of Toronto , Canada , who last NN demonstrated that quantum effects occur in plants , VBD that “ the biological experiments do seem intriguing , and I MD n’t dismiss them . ” ( source ) Today , numerous teleportation breakthroughs have been made . CD example comes from the work of Professor Rainer Blatt at the NNP of Innsbruck . He and his colleagues were successfully able to perform teleportation on atoms for the JJ NN . Their work was published in the journal Nature . ( source ) Another NN , published by a team of NNP of Queensland physicists in the journal Nature in 2013 , demonstrated successful teleportation with solid NN systems . ( source ) This is a process by which quantum NN can be transmitted from CD place to another without sending a physical carrier of NN . This is made possible through the phenomenon of entanglement . A team from the Joint Quantum Institute ( JQI ) at the NNP of Maryland ( UMD ) and the NNP of Michigan has succeeded in teleporting a quantum NN directly from CD atom to another over a substantial distance . ( source ) There are different categories of teleportation . Another types of teleportation apart from quantum is psychic , which is the conveyance of persons or inanimate objects by psychic means . “ It became VBN to myself , along with several colleagues both inside and outside of NN , that anomalous teleportation has been scientifically investigated and separately documented by the Department of Defense . ” ( source ) – Eric Davis , Ph.D , FBIS A paper published in the NNP ’s Republic of China ( PRC ) in September 1981 , in the journal Ziran Zazhi ( Nature Journal ) , reported that “ gifted NNS ” were able to VB the teleportation of small , physical objects from CD place to another . Objects included watches , horseflies , other insects , radio micro-transmitters , photosensitive paper and more . The paper , titled “ Some Experiments on the Transfer of Objects Performed by Unusual Abilities of the NNP NNP ” ( Shuhuang et al. , 1981 ) , reveals that participants never touched the objects beforehand . The experiments were done under both blind and double - blind conditions , and the researchers involved came from various colleges and sectors of the Department of Defense . Furthermore , NNS have conducted studies on NNS in the lab which produced remarkable results , observing NNS describe physical objects that had been hidden in a remote location . ( source ) The list of strange things reported in the NN of NN is never ending , and I VBP the ‘ politicization ’ of academia and publications , as well as the ‘ black budget ‘ NN , are important things to VB about when it comes to the NN of NN , what NN gets published , and what our minds are willing to explore – regardless of how hard it might be to accept ."

Murphy explains , “ There are negative interest rates and low interest rates that just keep staying down there , and supposedly things are really good . Look at our Dow at all - NN highs , and yet something is really wrong . Of course , this fits into the GATA premise on this whole thing . There ’s a lot of quantitative easing ( money printing ) and propping up of the markets , and it ’s on very shaky ground . The plug MD be pulled at any NN . . . . With interest rates where they are and debt growing all over the place , the reasons to be in gold are off the charts . ” Murphy VBZ “ silver is Kryptonite to central bankers ” because there is little supply to use in the cartel ’s suppression game . Murphy VBZ , “ You mention the word Kryptonite and the key is what silver is doing . It is an extraordinary situation RB now . . . . It seems to me that , this NN , silver is in play . . . . That is this big money talking on the JPMorgan crowd and their game . They are gradually moving in for what I VBP is VBG to be CD of the biggest market moves in history , and that is silver VBG to $ 50 ( per ounce ) and then a $ 100 ( per ounce ) . Basically , it ’s because supply is drying up . . . . Where is all this supply coming from that this JPMorgan crowd has been feeding the market with , and I VBP they are hitting the wall with it . I VBP this big money knows what ’s VBG on , and they are quietly moving in . That ’s the reason silver has been trading IN it has . $ 18.50 was a key number . That was the completion of a big base . . . . The next big key is to take out $ 20.50 , but the real number is $ 21 . If it gets above $ 21 , it ’s VBG to start trading chaotically with volatile action on the upside . The market move is VBG to be historic . ” Murphy has RB charged there was suppression of gold and silver prices and has been proven 100 % correct . He now charges , “ The real key for this gold cartel , as we call it , is the suppression of the gold price . They realized a JJ NN ago they MD n’t have a dichotomy between the silver and gold . So , they got involved in the silver market ( to suppress the price ) to make gold look IN it should be doing what it is . The problem is they are running out of physical silver to keep the price down . . . . Eventually , you are VBG to VB a commercial signal failure in silver , which means these so - called commercials , which is a misnomer because they are not commercials , they ’re gold cartel trying to keep the silver price down . They VBP when they lose NN of silver , and it gets to $ 21 ( per ounce ) , it will be the end of their gold suppression scheme . . . . It will be a gradual process because the price of silver is VBG to VB bonkers . It will show what they have been doing all these NNS . I VBP they are finally reaching a tipping point . . . . The death knell to the gold cartel is the lack of supply of silver to keep the price down . . . . I VBP you are VBG to VB the double top of $ 50 be taken out and VB to at least $ 100 per ounce and maybe a lot more . I VBP it ’s VBG to move up faster than anybody can imagine . . . . Gold is VBG to move to some big number RB . . . . If gold kept pace with inflation , it MD be double what it is today . ” Join Greg Hunter as he goes CD - on - CD with Bill Murphy , Chairman and co-founder of GATA .

In a statement on Wednesday , the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , which is conducting the NN , VBD preliminary data show patients who received remdesivir recovered faster than similar patients who received placebo . The finding — although difficult to fully characterize without full , detailed data for the NN — MD represent the JJ NN shown to improve outcomes in patients infected with the NN that put the JJ economy in a standstill and killed at least 218,000 NNS worldwide . During an appearance alongside NNP NNP in the Oval Office , Anthony Fauci , the director of NIAID , part of the National Institutes of NNP , VBD the data are a “ very important proof of concept ” and that there was reason for optimism . He cautioned the data were not a “ knockout . ” At the same NN , the NN achieved its primary goal , which was to improve the NN to recovery , which was reduced by four days for patients on remdesivir . The preliminary data showed that the NN to recovery was 11 days on remdesivir compared to 15 days for placebo , a 31 % decrease . The mortality rate for the remdesivir group was 8 % , compared to 11.6 % for the placebo group ; that mortality difference was not statistically significant . That is “ the JJ convincing evidence that an antiviral drug can really benefit NNP - CD patients , specifically hospitalized NNP - CD patients , ” VBD Frederick Hayden , a professor emeritus of clinical virology and medicine at the NNP of Virginia School of Medicine . “ This will VB the standard of care in the NNP NNPS and other NNS for the patients who have been shown to be benefited , ” he VBD , adding that determining the exact group that should receive the drug will require further examination of the data . Over the past few weeks , there have been conflicting reports about the potential benefit of remdesivir , a drug that was previously tried in Ebola . As previously reported by STAT , an early peek at Gilead ’s NN in severe NNP - CD patients , based on data from a trial at a Chicago hospital , suggested patients were doing better than expected on remdesivir . Days later , a summary of results from a NN in China showed that patients on the drug did not improve more than those in a NN group . Full results from the China NN were RB released Wednesday . But the NIAID NN , which was not expected to be released so soon , was by far the most important and rigorously designed test of remdesivir in NNP - CD . The NN compared remdesivir to placebo in 800 patients , with neither patients nor physicians knowing who got the drug instead of a placebo , meaning that unconscious biases will not affect the conclusions . The main goal of the NN is the NN until patients improve , with different measures of improvement depending on how sick they were to begin with . While the result means that the drug helps patients improve faster , it is not possible to say how dramatic those improvements are . Scott Gottlieb , the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration , VBD he expected there was enough evidence for the agency to issue an “ emergency use authorization ” for remdesivir . “ Remdesivir is n’t a home run but looks active and can be part of a toolbox of drugs and diagnostics that substantially lower our NN heading into the fall , ” he VBD . Aneesh Mehta , a physician at Emory NNP and an investigator in the NIAID NN , VBD the results were “ robust enough ” to report preliminary findings , but a full analysis of all the data will be required to fully understand the drug ’s effect . The NN to recovery seen in the final analysis “ MD be shorter , it MD be longer . We do n’t VB yet . ” Mehta RB expects the final results to do some analyses on which patients might benefit most from remdesivir . The FDA previously issued an emergency authorization for the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat NNP - CD , RB though at least some studies suggested the medicine was not effective . “ If hydroxychloroquine met [ the emergency ] standard , then remdesivir MD have seemed to cross that line a while ago , especially in the setting of treating critically ill patients , ” Gottlieb VBD . Remdesivir , which must be given intravenously , is likely to remain a NN for patients who are hospitalized . But it is RB likely that it will be most effective in patients who have been infected more recently , VBD Nahid Bhadelia , medical director of the special pathogens unit at Boston Medical Center . “ We VBP that with most antiviral medications the earlier you give it the better it is . ” VBD Bhadelia , who had experience giving remdesivir as an experimental NN for Ebola in Africa , where results are less encouraging . That means that better diagnostic testing will be essential to identifying patients who MD benefit . “ What will be important is that we find NNS on the outpatient side , ” Bhadelia VBD . “ Again , testing becomes important , we VBP to have them come to the hospital as soon as possible . ” Although the data have not yet been released , it ’s standard procedure for pharmaceutical and biotechnology NNS to release market - moving NN as soon as they have it , due to regulatory requirements . Gilead on Wednesday did release data from its own NN of remdesivir in patients with severe NNP - CD . This NN showed similar rates of clinical improvement in patients treated with a five - day and 10 - day course of remdesivir , the NN VBD . “ Unlike traditional drug development , we are attempting to evaluate an investigational agent alongside an evolving JJ NN . Multiple concurrent studies are helping inform whether remdesivir is a safe and effective NN for NN - CD and how to best utilize the drug , ” VBD Merdad Parsey , Gilead ’s chief medical officer , in a statement . Gilead VBD that its own NN in severe patients showed that it MD be possible to treat patients with a five - day NN of remdesivir , not the 10 - day course that was used in the NIAID trial . The NN ’s NN is enrolling approximately 6,000 participants from 152 different clinical trial sites all over the NN . The data disclosed Wednesday are from 397 patients , with a statistical comparison of patient improvement between the CD remdesivir NN arms — the five - day and 10 - day NN courses . Improvement was measured using a seven - point numerical scale that encompasses death ( at worst ) and discharge from hospital ( best outcome ) , with various degrees of supplemental oxygen and intubation in between . The NN design means that by itself it does n’t reveal much about how well remdesivir is working , because there is no group of patients who were untreated . The conclusion is that the CD durations of NN are basically the same . Peter Bach , the director of the Center for NNP Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Medical Center , VBD he is eager to VB the data from the NIAID NN but renewed his criticism of Gilead ’s severe NN for lacking a NN group of untreated patients . That MD have allowed researchers to make important conclusions about how the drug works that are just not possible now , he VBD . “ They ’ve squandered an unbelievable opportunity , ” Bach VBD . “ It ’s not VBG to tell us what to do with 80 - NN - olds with multiple comorbidities compared to 30 - NN - olds who are otherwise healthy . We ’re still VBG to be foundering around in the dark , or at least in a dim room , when we MD have learned more . ” In the NN , the median NN to clinical improvement was 10 days in the five - day NN group and 11 days in the 10 - day NN group . More than half of the patients in both groups were discharged from the hospital by day 14 . At day 14 , 64.5 % of the patients in the five - day group and 53.8 % of the patients in the 10 - day group achieved clinical recovery . Patients in the trial generally lived , though this MD be because their illness was not that severe to begin with . For most of the NN , patients already on ventilators were not enrolled . Eight percent of the patients treated with five days of remdesivir died , compared to 11 % of the patients treated for 10 days . Outside of Italy , where 77 patients were treated , the overall mortality rate across the entire NN was 7 % , Gilead VBD . Those mortality rates are lower than those seen in other studies , which have been in the teens and twenties . Only 5 % of patients in the five - day group and 10 % in the 10 - day group had side effects that led to a discontinuation . The most common bad effects — and it ’s impossible to tell which were from the drug — were nausea and acute respiratory failure . High liver enzymes occurred in 7.3 % of patients , with 3 % of patients discontinuing the drug due to elevated liver tests . A full evaluation of the results will have to wait until complete data are available . In the China NN , RB published Wednesday in the Lancet , investigators VBD that remdesivir “ did not significantly improve the NN to clinical improvement , mortality , or NN to clearance of NN in patients with serious NN - CD compared with placebo . ” There was a 23 % improvement in NN to clinical improvement for remdesivir compared to placebo , but the difference was not statistically significant . At the median , remdesivir - treated patients improved in 20 days compared to 23 days for placebo patients . At CD month , 14 % of the remdesivir patients had died compared to 13 % of the placebo - treated patients . The China NN enrolled patients with more severe NN - CD than the NN conducted by NIAID . The China NN was RB stopped early because of difficulties enrolling patients as the NN waned in China . Hayden , the NNP of Virginia virologist , was CD of the investigators in the China NN and pointed to the similarity of the results . He VBD that while the NIAID investigators had been able to enroll enough patients , the decrease in NNS in Wuhan due to the lockdown had made that impossible . “ I was struck by the consistency , ” he VBD ."

Unfortunately , a million dollars is not enough to buy luxury in London , Manhattan , Tokyo , Paris , San Francisco , or Sydney . But it does buy luxury in much of the rest of the NN . In fact , you do n't need nearly that much . There are plenty of destinations around the NN where you can live IN a millionaire for just a few thousand dollars a month . Forget about the billionaires with all those things that they never use . Start researching where the cost of living is low enough to live in relative splendor for far less than a million dollars . This tiny Central American nation , home to the famous Panama Canal , has regularly garnered a top spot on the International Living Annual NNP Retirement Index . Whether you relocate to the Caribbean or Pacific coast , no matter if you prefer a tropical or temperate NN , the affordable quality of NN remains a consistent draw . Panama City is the most sophisticated and expensive part of the country . However , it is still possible to live in NN - class luxury for under $ 4,000 a month . RB $ 1,500 buys considerable comfort in Panama City . Mountain towns , such as Boquete , offer milder temperatures and a lower cost of living . If you find that you VBP living here , it is surprisingly cheap and easy to retire to Panama . A good starting point to budget a Thai lifestyle is 65,000 Thai bahts or around $ 2,000 per month . That 's what the Thai NN demands of expatriates who seek a retirement visa . RB $ 3,500 wo n’t buy all - out luxury in Bangkok , where upmarket condos might require a budget closer to $ 5,000 per month . However , $ 2,000 will allow for a very comfortable lifestyle in smaller cities . Look into lovely Chiang Mai , renowned for its historic temples , cuisine , and forested hills . Considering that most locals VBP by on less than $ 1,000 a month , $ 3,000 MD feel IN a princely sum . There are RB JJ other fascinating places to retire in Thailand . Spain deserves a spot on this list for CD simple reason . It ’s the only low - priced country that ranks in Numbeo 's top ten for quality of NN . Of course , you ’ll need to steer clear of Madrid and Barcelona if you ’re seeking a posh lifestyle for poquito dinero ( not much money ) . Fortunately , JJ smaller cities and towns offer plenty of cultural , culinary , and recreational delights for a relatively modest price tag . Granada offers a relaxed and affordable lifestyle . It is home to the Alhambra , a NNP Heritage Site that was a finalist in the contest to be CD of the modern seven wonders of the NN . A city center three - bedroom apartment rents for about $ 690 , while a three - course meal for CD at a midrange restaurant comes to only around $ 23 . These prices are practically unheard of in the other NNS that rank in the top ten for quality of NN . Seville is similarly low - priced and holds such wonders as the Alcazar Palace ( Dorn on Game of Thrones ) and the fabulous Roman ruins in Italica . It is RB possible to retire in Spain with $ 200,000 . Do n’t discount Mexico as merely a vacation spot . This fascinating country is much more than the Yucatan Peninsula , that string of gorgeous beaches with all the tourist trappings that gorgeous beaches bring . In fact , Mexico has been gaining popularity as a retirement spot due to reasons that transcend its miles of oceanfront . You can live in Mexico in relative luxury ( VB maid service , a gardener , and dinners out ) on a budget of less than $ 2,500 a month . Certain provinces of Mexico continue to be dangerous , but others are considered much safer . At 122 square miles , Malta is a tiny bit of island paradise in the Mediterranean . Beautiful apartments in the capital city of Valletta rent for under $ 1,500 per month , so a $ 3,000 monthly budget stretches far here . Malta has JJ charms that are difficult to match in Europe . While famous capitals , such as Berlin and Paris , are freezing in the winter , temperatures in Malta hover in the balmy 60s . If foreign languages are n’t your forte , you ’re RB in luck : English is an official language in Malta . The Philippines has CD of the lowest costs of living in the NN , a warm NN , and JJ attractive destinations for expatriates . Here , it is possible to rent a JJ house with a private pool , a maid , and a chauffeur for what it MD cost to rent a luxury apartment in some NNS . Strong historical ties with the NNP NNPS RB helped make the Philippines friendly to English speakers . There are several well - developed parts of the country , such as Cebu City , that cater to retirees and other expatriates . However , it is essential to consider the pros and cons of retiring in the Philippines . Most NNS VBP of overpriced Paris when they VBP of France , but those who VBP the country best have always VBN better . Louis XIV knew how to live , and he preferred living in Versailles . It is possible to live IN an aristocrat , if not a king , for under $ 5,000 per month just outside Paris near Versailles . Parts of the Loire Valley , home to so JJ beautiful chateaus , are RB surprisingly affordable . France features a fabulous quality of NN . The fantastic food , rich history , refined culture , beautiful landscapes , and livable cities have drawn travelers for centuries . You can live very well in JJ parts of France for less than $ 3,000 a month . Just avoid Paris . There is so much to love about living in Portugal . The friendly NNS , romantic architecture , sunny beaches , port wine , and haunting fado music make for a unique experience . In Lisbon , Portugal ’s most expensive city , a furnished CD - bedroom NN in an upscale area can be VBN for around $ 1,000 a month . There are JJ alluring cities in Portugal for retirees . It should not be too hard to save enough money to retire in Portugal . Adventure junkies hold Costa Rica — Spanish for “ rich coast ” — dear to their hearts . That ’s because this compact country is bursting at the seams with waterfalls , rivers , lakes , and miles of pristine beaches . RB , do n't forget the dramatic volcanoes and diverse wildlife . Why not extend a Costa Rican adventure into a NN - round lifestyle ? Living in Costa Rica is RB more affordable than vacationing there . In resort towns along the central coast , a typical CD - bedroom condo near the beach can be rented for less than $ 1,000 per month . You might RB VB to buy a beach condo in Costa Rica . Another draw ? Medical care is RB excellent and inexpensive . With bragging rights for the cheapest cost of living in Central America , Nicaragua gets its fair share of budget and adventure travelers . They are drawn to warm weather , vibrant cities , colonial architecture , and idyllic seaside villages . Sure , Nicaragua 's history of civil war and revolutionary upheaval scares away some travelers . That RB means fewer NNS have discovered how nice Nicaragua can be today , so prices remain low . Granada is perched upon the picturesque north shore of Lake Nicaragua , with a volcano in view to add to the postcard - perfect scene . This city is home to JJ North American retirees in search of the good NN . Monthly expenses for a comfortable lifestyle average around $ 1,000 . Just imagine what you MD do with three times that . Nicaragua is CD of the best NNS for retirement in Latin America . If you VBP to VB more from your portfolio in a beautiful location , consider relocating to CD of these ten destinations . Here , paradise — or at least a very high quality of NN — comes with a decidedly lower price tag ."

Connor , son of famous JJ - earther Dave Murphy , spoke exclusively to UNILAD about NASA , the Sun , Photoshop and pretty much everything you ’ve ever wanted to ask someone who thinks the reason you VBP the curvature of NNP from a plane is because the windows are round . Speaking about why NASA and the NN MD lie about NN travel , he VBD : There are CD good reasons in my opinion . CD obvious reason MD be money . The money raised by NASA alone since their inception is something IN fifteen trillion dollars , and with that money they ’ve really shown little for their work . They ’re releasing composite images and articles and telling you this is what ’s happening , this is what we ’re doing , and we spent seven hundred million dollars to VB this photo of Pluto that we had to put together in Photoshop . A second thing is to make NNS feel insignificant . It makes you feel IN you ’re an insignificant speck of dust and therefore you ’re easy to VB . Basically if you can imagine the globe squashed down with Antarctica instead of being its own continent , being the perimeter around the side . So a lot of NNS say that ’s an NN wall . It ’s more IN a shelf or cliff . There ’s NN above , there ’s the firmament – or the dome – and there ’s NN above it and NN below it and there ’s no leaving it , there ’s no finding other Suns and stuff . You ca n’t fall off the edge , essentially . What about the curve of the NNP you can VB when you fly ? Conor VBD : You can not VB curvature from a plane . The reason why it MD seem is because of the NN planes have to be designed . Every single window on a plane has to be round and curved because the cabin itself is curved . You ca n’t have straight panes or they MD explode and everyone with the plane MD be done . Next NN you ’re on a plane , look out the window and at the wing , because the wing will seem to curve as well . Connor believes the only reason a lot of find JJ NNP conspiracies a complete joke is because we ’re taught to do so from a very early age . He did n’t personally always VB the NNP was JJ , but as he got older and delved into it he VBD there to be too JJ ‘ inconsistencies with the model you ’re taught at school ’ , he MD n’t ignore them anymore . ‘ At CD point , ’ he finishes , ‘ you have to make a decision on where you lie on it and I had to pick the NNP NNP . ’"

Bread , in all its various forms , is the most widely consumed food in the NN . Not only is it an important source of carbohydrates , it ’s RB portable and compact , which helps to explain why it has been an integral part of our diet for thousands of NNS . In fact , recent scholarship suggests humans started baking bread at least 30,000 NNS ago . Prehistoric NN had already been making gruel from NN and grains , so it was a small jump to starting cooking this mixture into a solid by frying it on stones . A 2010 NN by the National Academy of Sciences discovered traces of starch ( likely from the roots of cattails and ferns ) in prehistoric mortar and pestle - IN rocks . The roots MD have been peeled and dried before they were ground into flour and mixed with NN . Finally , the paste MD be cooked on heated rocks . But how did humanity VB from this prehistoric flatbread to a fluffy , grocery store loaf ? There were three primary innovations that created “ modern ” bread . 1. Leavening Leavening is what makes bread rise into a light and fluffy loaf . Bread without leavening is a VBN as flatbread , and is the most closely related to mankind ’s JJ breads . Examples include Middle Eastern pita , Indian naan and Central American tortillas . The most common leavening for bread is yeast . Yeast floats around in the air , looking for a nice place to make a home — IN a starchy bowl of flour and NN . The JJ leavened bread was likely the result of some passing yeast making a home in a bowl of gruel . The yeast began eating the sugars present in grain , and excreting CO2 , producing bubbles that resulted in lighter , airier bread . Commercial yeast production dates RB to the skilled bread makers of Ancient Egypt around 300 B.C . 2. Refined Flour The earliest bread grains MD have been ground by hand with rocks . This MD have resulted in coarse , whole grain bread — the descendants of which are dark , rustic breads from Europe , IN pumpernickel . The Mesopotamians refined this process around 800 B.C. , using CD JJ , circular stones , stacked on top CD another to grind the grain . These stones were continuously rotated by draft animals or slaves . This “ milling ” — which was the genesis for how we create flour today–created smooth , finely ground flour that quickly became prized as a status symbol . The desire for the whitest , most refined bread continued through the modern era , and later advancements included the sifting of flour to remove the bran and the germ and the bleaching of the flour itself . 3. Mechanized Slicing . For hundreds of NNS , the finest white breads were sold in whole loaves to be cut at home — IN a French baguette . The NNP York Public Library ’s “ Lunch ” exhibit notes : “ Nineteenth and early 20th - century cookbooks and magazines gave highly specific advice about lunchtime sandwich making . For ladies and NNS , the bread was supposed to be sliced very thinly and the crusts removed . For workers , thick slices with crusts were deemed more appropriate . ” But in 1917 , itinerant jeweler Otto Rohwedder created the JJ mechanized bread slicer . Initially , JJ NNS were convinced that housewives MD n’t be interested , and his bread - slicing machine was n’t installed in a factory until 1928 . However , within CD NNS , 90 % of store - bought bread was factory sliced . Progress led us to what was supposed to be the ideal loaf of bread : white , ultra - fluffy and pre-cut into RB slices . This perfect bread was dubbed “ American . ” By this standard , Wonderbread should have been the last loaf of bread we ever needed . But modern NN has uncovered the nutritional benefit of whole grains , and more and more consumers prefer the toothsome texture and nutty taste of a rustic loaf . If you feel inspired to replicate a prehistoric recipe IN I was , I ’ll warn you that Bob ’s Red Mill does not make a “ Cattail / Fern Blend Flour ” — yet . Settle for a “ 10 Grain Breakfast Cereal ” full of ancient grains , IN millet , coarsely ground . Then , visit your local home improvement store , and poke around the slate tiling . You MD be able to nab a few pieces of broken tile for free . Or , if you live somewhere they are easily accessible , simply walk outside and pick up a JJ rock . Now , you need to build a big fire . ( That ’s what I did at the Old Stone House of Brooklyn , a historic site that ’s surrounded by NNS ’s park . ) Let the flames die down until you have a bed of glowing , hot coals . Set the slate tiles on top of the coals , and wait about 10 minutes . Combine three cups of grain with about a cup of NN and mix into a thick , workable paste . Form the dough into CD - inch thick patties , and place them on the stones . After five minutes , flip them with a piece of bark — and you ’ll be amazed to VB the grain is browning on the heated rock . They MD stick , so I recommend greasing your cooking rocks before hand . In about 10 minutes , you ’ll have a pile of hot , crispy cakes . The outside is crunchy and tastes IN popcorn , the inside is moist and dense . I fed CD to CD of the NNS in the park , who described it as “ pretty good , ” though it ’s possible she was just being nice ."

By bypassing NN and ethical issues associated transhumanism , this NN hacking pushes this movement to strange JJ frontiers . As stated in my previous articles about the subject , transhumanism has been heavily promoted in mass NN in the past NNS , whether it be through movies , music videos , NN games and documentaries . Often , the word “ transhumanism ” is n’t RB used . Instead , we simply show how a robotic enhancement “ upgrades ” the JJ NN and makes it cooler , effectively selling the idea to NNS who VBP they are being entertained – especially young NNS . A by - product of this trend is “ NN hacking ” , a movement that forgoes the ethical and philosophical questions associated with transhumanism to VB RB into drilling robotic parts onto PRP ’s NN . While JJ of us dread the day when microchips implants will be a requirement in a dystopian society , some NNS actually pay to have it done to them . Here ’s an interesting article about the movement from NPR . A curious crowd lingered around Amal Graafstra as he carefully unpacked a pair of gloves , a small sterile blanket and a huge needle . A JJ line of NNS were waiting to VB tiny computer chips implanted into their hands . Graafstra had set up shop in a booth in the middle of an exhibit hall at the Austin Convention Center in Texas ’ capital , where he gathered last month with several hundred others who call themselves “ NN hackers ” — NNS who push the boundaries of implantable technology to improve the JJ NN . The movement evokes visceral reactions , brings up safety and ethical concerns and quickly veers into sci- fi questions about the line between JJ and cyborg . Graafstra is a pioneer in the NN . Using his own NN to experiment , he designed bio -safe magnets and the microchip he was about to implant into the hand of A.J. Butt , who was sporting a tall , blue mohawk . The implantable RFID chips hold encrypted NN , and their unique ID numbers can be used to open doors or unlock the owner ’s smartphone , which is what Butt wanted to do . Butt took a deep breath . The needle plunged into his NN at the base of his thumb , and a chip bigger than a grain of rice slipped just below the NN . Across the NN , Sasha Rose , who was working a meditation booth at the convention , watched the NNS line up to be “ chipped . ” She shook her head : This was the craziest thing she had seen . She wondered about Graafstra ’s credentials . She thought this was a medical procedure , so should he be performing it ? Did his clients VB the potential consequences of carrying personal NN on a device inside their NN ? “ More than the crazy concept , it ’s actually NNS ’s willingness to accept it . That ’s why it ’s crazy to me , ” Rose VBD . “ NNS are just willing to just line up and VB , ‘ Yeah , stick that in me . ’ ” At night , JJ of the convention - goers gathered at a club on Austin ’s Sixth Street . Graafstra was outside with Ryan O’Shea , whose NN Grindhouse Wetware made the Internet squirm earlier this NN when it released a close - up surgery NN of CD of its implants called Northstar . In it , a NN gets a small incision in his hand , and then , with a metallic tool dipped into it , the NN is lifted to produce a cavity where a round subdermal implant with five LED lights is placed . The result looks dystopian — the incision is stitched with black thread , and LED lights make the NN on the hand glow red . But NN hackers view the NN differently , Graafstra VBD . They VBP technology has reached a point where it can improve the JJ NN instead of just fixing what ’s broken . “ A patient MD someday come very soon and say , ‘ My eye is totally fine , but I VBP an eye that can VB infrared . And I VBP an eye that can zoom , ’ ” Graafstra VBD . That kind of future — where the JJ NN is augmented by technology — is the goal of JJ of these experiments . O’Shea VBD Grindhouse Wetware is using its LED device to test how RB a device IN it can remain charged inside a NN , and Graafstra VBD his RFID chip is a small attempt at merging digital identity with physical identity . “ I VBP once NNS realize , ‘ Oh , it ’s OK that my grandma has a pacemaker ’ … NNS are VBG to start to accept this , ” O ’Shea VBD . “ You VBP , the era of transhumanism , I MD say , is here . So let ’s accept that and then VB where that logically takes us . ” Inside the club , a drone hovered above the dance floor . The polished steel and the electronic dance music gave it a futuristic feel . Standing near the bar was Tony Salvador , who studies JJ values and how they affect technology at Intel . He was at the conference to VB a feel of when and if “ NN hacking ” MD be accepted into the mainstream . Sometimes , he VBD , technology moves too fast and outpaces accepted JJ boundaries — not to mention laws . He argued that was part of the reason why early wearers of Google Glass were called “ glassholes . ” “ It created a JJ misunderstanding , ” Salvador VBD . “ You did n’t VB what was VBG on . ” To Salvador , the boundaries of acceptance are a matter of our JJ philosophy , an area that he argued was driven by esoteric discourse without tangible moral and ethical recommendations . The philosophers , he VBD , are letting us down . Alva Noë , a philosopher at the NNP of California , Berkeley and a contributor to NPR ’s 13.7 : Cosmos and Culture blog , has written extensively on what he calls “ cyborgian naturalness . ” He disagreed that the modern philosophers dropped the ball , saying that tackling the matter MD involve unpacking CD questions : • Is it OK to cut into JJ bodies for these kinds of experiments ? • How much tolerance should society have for artificially enhancing the NN ? To the JJ question , Noë VBD he VBD the “ NN hacking ” experimentation on humans “ ethically disturbing ” and MD n’t fathom a NN or any other NNS conducting these kinds of operations . The second question was more complicated . “ We do n’t condemn NNS for using glasses to VB better , ” he VBD . “ But we do start to VB taking speed to cope with your work NN is questionable . ” Because those kinds of judgments are an ethical question , drawing a tolerance line MD always be a moving target , he VBD . “ We MD reach consensuses and then lose them , ” Noë VBD . “ Just as there was once a consensus where it was OK to smoke to function effectively , and now we have the consensus that , increasingly , it ’s not OK to do that . ” If there ’s a rock star in the NN - hacking movement , it ’s Neil Harbisson , a colorblind artist from Barcelona who persuaded a NN to implant a camera in the NN of his head . The antenna , as he calls it , essentially lets Harbisson listen to colors by detecting the dominant color in front of him and translating it into musical notes . The NN he tells it , a medical ethics committee in Europe had refused to sign off on the operation , but a NN agreed to perform the surgery anonymously . From it , Harbisson emerged with a camera connected to a device on the NN of his skull , its lens dangling in front of his face on a rod that arcs over his head . As he walked the streets of Austin , he described how he perceived the NN : the red traffic light sounded IN an A note ; the green grass sounded IN an F . In his keynote address at the conference , Harbisson VBD the JJ NN he heard those colors in his sleep , he felt truly cyborg . Now , he no longer identifies as JJ but as a “ cybernetic organism . ” “ If we define ourselves as organisms , suddenly our group is wider , ” he VBD . “ We are on the same level as an insect , or as a cat , or as a plant . ” Harbisson is well aware of how the NN perceives him . He moved from Barcelona to NNP York City in search of “ peace ” with another friend in the transhumanist movement , Moon Ribas . Ribas has an electronic device in her arm that she VBD vibrates when there is an earthquake anywhere in the NN . On more than CD occasion , NNS have tried to rip off his antenna , Harbisson VBD . That ’s part of the reason why he co-founded the Cyborg Foundation to advocate for “ cyborg rights . ” When asked if he ’s ever thought about just taking the antenna off , Harbisson demurred . “ To me , it ’s much stronger , the wish to sense what ’s around me , than the fact that NNS keep annoying me , ” he VBD , adding that maybe , in the future , as others VBP JJ senses , he ’ll be considered normal ."

"" Thompson did n’t include any disagreement . While the networks had plenty of NN to worry about the future of birds , most network NN shows did n’t take much NN to include any other point of view RB though hundreds of NNS have expressed skepticism of manmade NN NN NN . Another NBC reporter , Kerry Sanders , hyped the threat of warming to polar bears and walruses on Dec. 9 , 2007 , "" a NN NNS say MD melt away by 2050 . "" Sanders did n’t include any NNS who disagreed with that claim . The lack of balance on the issue prompted CD network journalist , John Stossel of ABC , to do a NN on the NN ’s CD - sidedness on “ 20/20 ” Oct. CD , 2007 . “ You ’ve heard the reports . The globe is warming . And it ’s our fault . And the consequences will be terrible . But you should VB there is another side to this NN , ” teased Stossel as he began his “ Give me a Break ” segment . There is another side to the issue . In CD NN , Stossel interviewed four NNS critical of the so - called “ consensus ” on JJ warming . That ’s four more dissenting NNS than CBS put on its network in six entire months . To better assess network behavior on this key topic , the Business & NNP Institute examined 205 stories from ABC , CBS and NBC that mentioned "" JJ warming "" or "" NN NN "" between July 1 , 2007 , and Dec. 31 , 2007 . BMI VBD skepticism was shut out of a vast majority of reports . Overall , a measly 20 percent had any dissent at all referenced by a journalist or guest . Skeptical voices were suppressed by the networks , outnumbered by nearly a 7 - to - 1 ratio by those promoting fear of NN NN or being used by the network for the same purpose . CBS had an RB worse record : nearly 38 proponents to CD skeptic . Lengthy segments IN Scott Pelley ’s Oct. 21 , 2007 , "" 60 Minutes "" NN on "" The Age of Megafires "" certainly had NN to include an alternative point of view to the notion that JJ warming is largely responsible for bigger , hotter fires in the American West . But Pelley skipped those voices – voices IN a NNP of California Merced professor published on the Washington Spokesman - Review Web site about the California wildfires . According to Alan Zarembo’s Oct. 24 , 2007 , NN , “ NNS VBD it MD be difficult to make that case , given the combustible mix of drought and wind that has plagued the region for centuries or more . ” Anthony Westerling , a UC - Merced professor and NN scientist , VBD Zarembo that the wildfires were the result of CD “ staples of the region ’s climatic history , ” meaning “ strong Santa Ana winds ” and “ a drought that turned much of the hillsides to bone - dry kindling . ” "" Neither can be attributed to NN NN , "" VBD Westerling . The near blackout of skepticism on the networks did n’t come as much of a surprise , since reporters IN Pelley have been much more than onlookers in the NN of JJ warming . In JJ NNS they have become advocates – RB VBG “ to the ends of the NN ” “ to find evidence of NN NN . ” Ann Curry of NBC’s “ Today ” made that clear on Oct. 29 , 2007 : “ [ O ] ur mission , of course , is to find evidence of NN NN . ” When NNS with other views were mentioned , it sometimes came with a denigrating label IN “ deniers ” or “ cynics . ” Such critics were RB portrayed as JJ - earthers by journalists and guests . CD person skeptical of manmade NN NN , a Kentucky NN representative , managed to VB on the air but was treated to an exceptionally hostile interview by ABC ’s Bill Weir . There were JJ other flaws in the reporting that created a very CD - sided perspective . Journalists repeatedly phrased questions or made statements indicating JJ - caused warming was a fact , and they included opinions of politicians , movie stars , musicians and ordinary NNS IN bankers instead of relying on NNS . But according to Dr. Pat Michaels viewers MD be better served by hearing both sides . “ They MD benefit from appreciating the true scientific diversity on the topic . The arguments against these gloom and doom JJ warming scenarios are much stronger than the arguments for them , ” Michaels VBD BMI . According to NBC ’s Brian Williams , “ There ’s no shortage of folks out there saying it ’s [ JJ warming is ] not all that bad . ” Williams was teasing a “ Nightly NNP ” NN on August 15 that included CD other voices : Dr. Pat Michaels , a NN professor of JJ sciences , and Marlo Lewis , senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute . Williams was certainly JJ – there are hundreds of NNS from around the NN who question the JJ warming “ consensus ” – but in the NN the latter half of 2007 you had to look hard to find them . On the three networks , 80 percent of stories ( 167 out of 205 ) did n’t mention skepticism or anyone at all who dissented from JJ warming alarmism . CBS did the absolute worst job . Ninety - seven percent of its stories ( 34 out of 35 ) ignored other opinions . Williams ’ own network , NBC , came in a close second with 85 percent ( 76 out of 89 ) excluding skepticism . ABC was the most balanced network , but still censored dissent from 64 percent of its stories ( 34 out of 53 ) . But dissent flourishes . The U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works ( EPW ) Committee released a list on Dec. 20 , 2007 , of more than 400 skeptical NNS from different fields – astrophysics , geology , climatology , meteorology and others . The release did n’t RB earn a NN brief from CD of the three networks as of Dec. 31 , 2007 . RB when CD show claimed it MD represent a range of opinions on the issue , it did n’t . On Oct. 30 , 2007 , NBC “ Today ” co-host Matt Lauer teased the upcoming “ Ends of the NNP ” broadcasts saying to Meredith Vieira , “ And you ’re VBG to be interviewing all the experts talking about the issues of NN NN . ” ( emphasis added ) Vieira replied , “ Absolutely . Getting into a whole debate , too , because some NNS VBP there ’s an effect of NN NN , others say not really . So we ’re VBG to discuss all of it and give viewers at home real tips on what you can do . ” But on Nov. 5 and 6 , 2007 as “ Today ” went to the “ Ends of the NNP , ” the only “ experts ” Vieira spoke to were former vice NN Al Gore , Chip Giller of Grist.org – a left - wing JJ Web site – and Katherine Wroth , co-author of “ Wake Up and Smell the Planet . ” Grist is an extreme publication . David Roberts of the environmentalist magazine called for "" war crimes trials for these bastards ¬– some sort of NN Nuremberg , "" referring to the NN NN "" denial industry . "" ( Roberts later retracted his comment , but not until it received a strongly negative response . ) The only skepticism of JJ warming “ consensus ” that came up was a brief mention by Vieira as she interviewed Gore . She asked Gore about John Christy , CD scientist formerly with the NNP Nations ’ Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) , who criticized Gore ’s predictions in an op - ed printed in The Wall Street Journal . Gore shot RB calling Christy an “ outlier . ” Vieira did n’t question Gore ’s remark or give Christy an opportunity to respond to the attack . Perhaps if she had , Christy MD have echoed his remarks from the Nov. 1 , 2007 , Wall Street Journal : “ I VBP neither the developing catastrophe nor the smoking gun proving that JJ activity is to blame for most of the warming we VBP . Rather , I VBP a reliance on NN models ( useful but never ‘ proof ’ ) and the coincidence that NN in NN dioxide and JJ temperatures have loose similarity over NN , ” VBD Christy . He continued , “ We [ dissenting NNS ] discount the possibility that everything is caused by JJ actions , because everything we ’ve seen the NN do has happened before . NN levels rise and fall continually . The Arctic NN cap has shrunk before . CD millennium there are hippos swimming in the Thames , and a geological blink later there is an NN bridge linking Asia and North America . ” Journalists practically drooled over Al Gore during Live NNP interviews and after he won the Nobel Peace Prize . In contrast , NNS with alternative views barely got face NN on the networks . Instead , they received insults and hostile questions . The ugliest NN of a skeptic was by Bill Weir on Nov. 18 , 2007 , “ Good Morning America . ” He was interviewing Democratic NN representative Bill Gooch from Kentucky . Weir peppered Gooch with hardball questions and RB attacked Gooch ’s motives : Gooch made it clear that he supported an open debate , saying , “ [ T ] here is another side of the NN . I VBP what we have is we have the problem of JJ warming about to become a political problem when lawmakers in Congress , when governors in NNS , when RB the courts start to act in ways that are gonna affect the American NNS in severe ways . ” Gooch then mentioned the possible $ 6 - trillion cost of CD bill to deal with JJ warming . “ And what I wanna make sure that we do is that if we act , we have the NN JJ , ” explained Gooch . Weir was n’t satisfied : “ But , but according to all these NNS , the more handwringing we do , the more we dither on this , the worse it ’s VBG to VB . And what if you ’re wrong ? What if this is , in fact , a JJ catastrophe ? Is n’t it a moral imperative as a public servant to err on the side of planetary survival and VB something done ? ” Instead of letting Gooch debate with someone who disagreed , Weir filled that role himself . He came across as a passionate advocate for “ something ” that MD supposedly aid “ survival , ” ignoring the cost , accuracy , and his supposed objectivity . Journalists RB called skeptics “ deniers , ” conjuring images of Holocaust deniers , and cast them as JJ - earthers – ironically forgetting that there was once a scientific consensus that the NN was JJ . When Gore attacked Dr. Christy [ who was mentioned by Meredith Vieira ] on “ Today ” Nov. 5 , 2007 , Gore specifically compared NNS critical of anthropogenic ( JJ - caused ) JJ warming to NNS who VBP the NNP is JJ . “ Well , he ’s an outlier , he no longer belongs to the IPCC . And he is RB outside the scientific consensus … There are still NNS who VBP that the NNP is JJ , ” VBD Gore . Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger made the same disparaging comparison on July 16 , 2007 “ Early Show ” on CBS . After co-host Harry Smith VBD , “ [ I ] asked why some NNS still do n’t VB we have a problem . ” “ Well , I VBP that there is [ sic ] still a lot of NNS that still VBP that the NN is JJ , ” VBD Schwarzenegger . NBC ’s chief JJ affairs correspondent Anne Thompson VBD , "" He is proudly a denier , "" of NN professor and CATO senior fellow Dr. Pat Michaels . Michaels VBD BMI , “ She has no idea what she ’s talking about . I have written and spoken repeatedly in the last 15 NNS that JJ beings are responsible for most of the warming in the past century . ” What Michaels disagrees on is whether such warming will result in JJ catastrophe . Recalling that NBC interview , Michaels continued , “ The interview was great , but she pulled out CD little piece and took it completely out of context . It was really , really disappointing . The interview was conducted in a very professional fashion , it was the editing that clearly did not reflect the tone and content of the overall interview . ” Thompson actually included CD dissenting views in that Aug. 15 , 2007 , “ Nightly NN ” but undermined both their opinions by implying they were not experts and were only making trouble : “ NN experts say whether hired guns or honest dissenters , deniers are confusing the issue and delaying solutions . ” A paltry 37 NNS expressing skepticism were included in six months of TV NN coverage on the issue across three networks . That included all kinds of NNS IN politicians or NN employees , business representatives , celebrities , ordinary NNS and unidentified NNS . Only seven of them were NNS IN Michaels . CBS practically banned skeptics from its network , including only four and not a single scientist . The network seemed to adopt the mentality of CBS journalist Scott Pelley , who referred to JJ warming skeptics as “ deniers ” in March 2006 when he VBD , “ If I do an interview with [ Holocaust survivor ] Elie Wiesel , am I required as a journalist to find a Holocaust denier ? ” Recent “ 60 Minutes ” segments from Pelley indicated he has n’t changed his mind about balanced journalism . Those skeptical of the JJ impact of Gore ’s Live NNP concerts on July 7 , 2007 RB earned scorn from the NN – RB those IN Bob Geldof who were n’t questioning the NN . “ [ T ] here have been cynics out there who question whether the artists are practicing what they preach , ” VBD NBC ’s Lester Holt on July 7 , 2007 “ Today . ” ABC ’s Bill Weir claimed that “ all the NNS ” urge immediate action to stop JJ warming , but it was n’t just NNS the three networks relied on to make that case . Far from it . There were politicians and NN workers . Musicians IN Madonna and Dave Matthews . Movie star Leonardo DiCaprio . And quite possibly , your next - door neighbor . What those celebrities VBD had little to do with NN and everything to do with advocacy . Singer KT Tunstall , a Live NNP performer , was quoted by ABC on July 7 , 2007 . “ I VBP I am an environmentalist . I mean , I do n’t have a car . I live in a small apartment , ” VBD Tunstall . Madonna urged Live NNP attendees , "" If you wanna save the planet , let me VB you jumping up and down . "" But it was n’t just globe - trotting stars telling NNS the planet was in danger and crowding out any other perspective . Politicians offered perhaps more substance , but certainly not much more NN than the Hollywood types . In addition to fawning over Gore , networks interviewed Florida Gov. Charlie Crist ( R ) , California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ( R ) and NNP York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg ( Independent ) , among others . Reporters RB relied on ordinary voices to reinforce the idea that JJ warming was already a major threat impacting our daily lives . Only 15 percent of the NNS used to support JJ warming positions were NNS – identified as a "" scientist "" or with a specialty IN genetics , ecology , biology or oceanography . A total of 71 NNS were included in six months of coverage . But networks turned to ordinary , unidentified NNS nearly a third more often than the NNS ( 101 to 71 . ) Networks turned to ordinary NNS IN CD Live NNP concertgoers and the unidentified female “ consumer ” quoted by ABC “ NNP NNP with Charles Gibson ” on Sept. 14 , 2007 . “ You VBP , I VBP everybody ’s got to VB about it . We ’ve got to VB , ” VBD a woman in a NN about NN labeling of food products . Those quotes were used to underline the points that reporters made . CD NN on “ Today ” Nov. 6 , 2007 , warned that melting NN MD kill off polar bears . Reporter Kerry Sanders included three unidentified NNS talking about polar bears – supporting his remark that “ Worst - case scenario : If the Arctic NN continues to melt , in the next 100 NNS , the U.S. Wildlife Service VBZ the only place you ’ll find a polar bear will be at the zoo . ” Worries over Arctic melt flooded JJ warming coverage in the latter half of 2007 , but as columnist John Tierney wrote in the Jan. 1 , 2008 NNP York Times : “ When the Arctic NN NN last NN [ 2007 ] hit the lowest level ever recorded by satellites , it was big NN and heralded as a sign that the whole planet was warming . When the Antarctic NN NN last NN reached the highest level ever recorded by satellites , it was pretty much ignored . ” No Need for Debate , Warming is ‘ Fact ’ To JJ in the NN NN , JJ warming and its reported NN were already established fact . It was clear by the NN some journalists talked about warming that they had accepted Gore ’s insistence that “ the debate ’s over . ” Just listen to CBS ’s Harry Smith : “ Before we do anything else , there is , in fact , JJ NN NN . It really affects some climates much more than others and it ’s really caused some real serious problems . ” Those serious problems Smith was talking about were allergies during a segment on the Aug. 7 , 2007 “ Early Show . ” ABC ’s Sam Champion seemed to agree . Champion called the fourth U.N. IPCC report “ definitive ” on Sept. 5 , 2007 and VBD he had been “ investigating the alarming numbers of animals that are disappearing due to JJ warming ” in July . But Dan Harris went the farthest on Dec. 2 , 2007 in a NN about security NN and JJ warming . The “ NNP NNP Sunday ” host VBD viewers to “ VB about this scenario : JJ warming contributes to a severe drought and food shortage in a third - NN country . The NN collapses . Warlords take over . America is forced to intervene . ” Shockingly , Harris then claimed : “ It ’s already happened , Somalia , 1993 , with disastrous consequences . ” Harris excluded expertise on the Somali situation or any context . JJ Rights Watch , a liberal international organization , gave a very different perspective at the NN of the crisis RB in 1992 : “ Somalia has historically been subject to famines , especially in the pastoral areas of the center and north … The current famine that threatens Mogadishu and south - central Somalia is radically different in origin and impact . Drought has played only a minor role , and the main victims are poor townspeople , farmers and rural laborers . ” The ABC correspondent did n’t include any statements about the NN the war was thought to have contributed to the famine . Journalists were n’t the only ones claiming that JJ warming was a fact , though . But the NNS journalists chose to interview RB included Gore saying the “ debate ’s over ” and did n’t dispute Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. ’s incorrect statement that there was “ zero dissent ” on the issue , or Leonardo DiCaprio ’s assertion of a “ 90 - percent consensus . ” “ Consensus ” was rarely questioned by reporters at all , and ABC ’s Bill Weir RB used the concept of “ these 4,000 or so NNS ” to hammer at CD person expressing a different view . The NN did a terrible job of actually explaining what the IPCC was . Atmospheric scientist Dr. John Christy VBD NNP & Sky Web site that the “ IPCC MD do well to define what each participant truly contributes to each product ( i.e. Summary for Policy Makers vs. Full Text ) so that the NN MD VB that thousands of NNS never reached a ‘ consensus ’ on anything . ” “ When the Full Text is developed , ‘ consensus ’ is a concept held by the chapters ’ Lead Authors who often ignore or contradict positions offered by the Contributing Authors and Reviewers , ” explained Christy . David Henderson , a former chief economist of the Organisation for NNP Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , wrote a detailed criticism of the IPCC in the Oct. 11 , 2007 Wall Street Journal .

BMI VBD that 90 percent of the stories did n’t mention cost at all , RB though the networks urged immediate action to stop the “ NN crisis . ” “ NBC Nightly NNP ” ignored cost in a Dec. 18 , 2007 report about the recent NN bill passed by Congress . “ What America drives MD VB dramatically under the NN bill , ” VBD Anne Thompson before quoting David Hamilton of the left - wing environmentalist group Sierra Club . Hamilton lauded parts of the bill during the “ Fueling NN ” segment : “ This bill means that we will VB all the same safety , all the same performance that we ’ve ever gotten from our cars , but we ’ll VB it with more miles to the gallon . ” Thompson and Hamilton both ignored the obvious cost to auto manufacturers of designing vehicles that will be able to meet the JJ fuel efficiency requirements . Likely , those costs will be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher vehicles prices . Other plans to curb greenhouse - NN NNS MD cost trillions of dollars . CD estimate by business consulting firm CRA International put a $ 4 - trillion to $ 6 - trillion price tag on the Lieberman - Warner bill , which MD mandate scaling RP NNS levels to 1990s levels by 2020 . That MD cost each American NN , woman and NN $ 494 a NN . Network reporters RB did n’t focus on how much is already being spent . As the Business & NNP Institute reported in its “ Fire and NN ” NN , more than 99.5 percent of American NN NN funding comes from the NN – taxpayers – and we spend $ 4 billion per NN on NN NN NN . The Kyoto treaty that was never ratified by the U.S. carried an estimated cost of $ 440 billion per NN for America . The Senate voted 95 to 0 to reject it . BMI examined all ABC , CBS and NBC NN transcripts that included the terms “ JJ warming ” or “ NN NN ” during the most recent six month period – from July 1 , 2007 , to Dec. 31 , 2007 . Only stories mentioning those terms were included in the NN . The stories were split into CD categories : stories and casual mentions . Casual mentions encompassed anchor briefs shorter than 50 words and longer stories that only mentioned JJ warming or NN NN incidentally ( the NN was not about that issue ) . “ Dissent , ” for the purpose of this NN , included any uncertainty [ "" I do n’t VB "" ] , alternative opinions about warming , and caution against making NN NN policy decisions without more NN . It RB included criticism of “ solutions ” to JJ warming and “ awareness ” campaigns IN Live NNP ¬– RB when the critic was n’t disagreeing with manmade NN NN , but just the usefulness of worldwide rock concerts . NNS quoted in a NN that supported NN NN claims were placed in the proponent category because their comments were used by the network to support the manmade JJ warming viewpoint . There was CD exception . In CD NN , scientist Bill Nye presented both positions on the issue in a balanced manner . He was counted as neutral in that NN .

B.o.B , born Bobby Ray Simmons Jr. , is a rapper from Georgia who once recorded a diss track about physicist Neil deGrasse Tyson , after the CD got into a NNP fight in 2016 about whether the NNP is round . The rapper is a member of the NNP NNP Society , a group of NNS who are convinced that the planet is JJ , not round . A scroll through B.o. B's NNP feed RB reveals a number of other NN beliefs : He is an anti-vaxxer , a 9/11 truther and RB , for some reason , believes that oil does not form from the remains of organic material buried under pressure . B.o.B's JJ GoFundMe has a $ 1 million goal and has raised $ 2,701 from 98 NNS in the five days since he put up the request . ( He pledged the JJ $ 1,000 himself . ) The goal , according to the rapper , is to launch a satellite as far into NN as necessary to "" find the curve "" of NNP . [ 7 Ways to Prove the NNP Is Round ( Without Launching a Satellite ) ] How we VBP the NNP is round Despite myths about Christopher Columbus believing he might sail off the edge of the NNP , humans have VBN that the NN is round for a very , very JJ NN . The Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras left the JJ written arguments for a round NNP in 500 B.C. Ancient Greeks thought the sphere was the perfect shape , so it stood to reason , Pythagoras figured , that the NNP was spherical . A few hundred NNS later , according to the American Physical Society ( APS ) , Aristotle dropped some scientific evidence into the debate . He pointed out that during lunar eclipses , NNP 's shadow on the moon is curved ; ships VBG over the horizon seem to drop down , hull - RB , rather than becoming tinier and tinier until they disappear ; and different stars are visible from different vantage points on NNP , which MD n't make much sense if the planet were JJ . The Greek mathematician Eratosthenes , born in 276 B.C. , RB managed to determine the circumference of the NNP . He did this , according to the APS , by measuring the angle of the shadow of a stick stuck in the ground on the summer solstice in Alexandria , on what is today the Egyptian coast . He knew that in Aswan , Egypt ( then VBN as Syene ) , the sun cast no shadows on the day of the solstice — it was directly overhead . The difference in the sun 's angle between Syene and Alexandria corresponded to CD - fiftieth of a complete circle , so Eratosthenes realized that if he knew the exact distance between the CD cities , he 'd just need to multiply to determine the full circumference of the NNP . The mathematician had to hire surveyors to walk the distance with precisely measured steps , but he eventually landed on a total circumference for the planet of between 24,000 and 29,000 miles ( 39,000 to 47,000 kilometers ) . He turned out to be remarkably accurate : Around the equator , the planet 's circumference is 24,900 miles ( 40,072 km ) . So if the ancient Greeks had it figured out , how can anyone still VB in a JJ NNP in the age of satellites and rocket launches ? [ Top 10 NN Theories ] The resurgence of JJ - NNP beliefs started in the early 1800s with a writer named Samuel Rowbotham , who developed an entire alternative cosmology around the idea that the NNP is a JJ plane enclosed by a dome of NN , surrounded by a perimeter of NN walls . Rowbotham 's philosophy was that the NNP looks JJ , from a NN 's point of view walking on the NN , so everyone who VBD they MD show otherwise must be lying . The International NNP NNP Society , formed in 1956 , draws from Rowbotham 's views . In the mid-1990s , the NN of the group claimed to have 3,500 paying members , according to his NNP York Times obituary . Today , the NNP NNP Society website claims to have 555 members , the most recent being B.o.B . JJ - Earthers do n't trust NASA or any other NN agency . According to the NNP NNP Society 's FAQs , astronauts are being bribed or coerced into lying ; airplane windows distort views to make it look IN the horizon curves ; and the International NNP Station is a hoax . RB , gravity is n't real . An independent satellite launch MD or MD not convince B.o. B that the NNP really does curve , but he MD find the process a bit difficult if he does n't accept that the planet is round . To launch a satellite ( or any other object ) into NN , you have to take into account the NNP 's radius . In the formula for the speed needed to achieve orbit , V = sqrt ( g0 * Re ^ 2 / ( Re + h ) ) , "" Re "" is the mean planetary radius . Astronomer Johannes Kepler sorted this out in the 1600s , according to NASA . It remains to be seen whether B.o. B will ever VB a chance to launch a satellite , anyway . According to The Verge , GoFundMe has frozen the rapper 's donation account , meaning he wo n't be able to access the funds unless he can provide more NN that the money will not be mismanaged ."

This NN started to become more and more popular around 2009 and is growing ever since . It is considered CD of the most controversial NN theories existing . They claim the NNP to be JJ because for them it feels IN and looks IN it is . The ones believing in this NNP call themself “ The NNP NNP Society ” and the importance about this is that RB though there is evidence to the contrary they claim those “ to be fabrications of a ‘ round NNP NN ’ ” ( Wolchover ) . The believers in the NNP NNP NNP VBP that the “ NNP is a disc with the Arctic Circle in the center and Antarctica , a 150 - NN - tall wall of NN , around the rim . ” ( Wolchover ) . Believers claim that the NASA guards protect those NN walls from NNS that try to climb over and fall from the disc . In their eyes they RB VBP that NNP ’s gravity is an illusion and objects do not accelerate downward , they are “ driven up by a mysterious force called dark NN ” . On the opposite end , there are countless photographs , videos , and imagery from astronauts and from the International NNP Station that is enough evidence to show that the NNP is actually round , but the interesting part here is that RB though there is evidence that prove their claims wrong in their eyes it is not considered real evidence and faked by the NN . Those who VBP in it most likely misinterpret the evidence and are only looking for beliefs that MD confirm their owns . This is RB called confirmation bias .

Thank_VBP you_PRP ._.","With every interesting celestial event these days , Christian prophecy theorists take to NNP to share their speculation on why it's a "" sign "" and what it might just mean . But does NNP really communicate warnings this NN in the sun , moon and stars ? Does the Bible really instruct us to look for "" signs "" in the heavens ? What are we to "" watch "" for according to Jesus ? As you will learn , theorists ( unintentionally ) deceive themselves and others when they do n't properly define and use the word "" sign "" the same NN the Bible does . VB Scriptural answers to these important questions , ones that you wo n't find on NNP no matter how JJ "" views "" a NN has ... Since the Christian speculation over the "" four NN moons "" lunar eclipses of 2014 - 2015 failed and neither the Great Tribulation nor the Rapture happened as predicted , we 're still here . That means now we VBP to discuss similar speculation about the latest solar eclipse or celestial event . Are you ready ? Once again , it 's all thanks to NNP ... Yes , the same wonderful NNP that brings you : • any song or music NN from your childhood you VBP to experience again , • instructional videos to fix anything and everything in your NN , ... RB brings you theories that either were dismissed with the arrival of NNP or that are too obviously contrived to ever spread through other channels that cost money or by free channels that are limited to much - less - persuasive text ( IN the original Web 1.0 ) . Why do you VB JJ NNP NN is in a resurgence ? ( No , NASA did not develop a NN machine and bring RP medieval NNS and teach them to blog . ) It 's because free NN allows any "" thought "" ( using the term loosely ) to VB bolstered up by convincing charts , photos and the silver tongues of persuasive on - screen personalities . JJ - earther Christians began emailing me in early 2015 RB after a now popular NNP NN on the topic was posted : • 2015 , JJ JJ - earther to write me : "" I have n't seen you write about the E yet , which by the NN , fits RB better with bible teachings . "" • 2016 , same person after writing a JJ NNP article for him : "" Please cancel ALL emails to me . You are a and obviously have spent no NN on researching the JJ NNP . "" Likewise , because of NNP , prophetic speculation is spreading about the latest interesting eclipse . It 's RB popular enough to break into mainstream NN just IN the 2014 - 2015 speculation did . I say "" interesting "" eclipse because there are several eclipses ( lunar or solar ) every NN that are simply ignored by our helpful NNP "" watchmen . "" Unless a celestial event has something extra ( IN taking place on Jewish holy days or happening seven NNS away from something else interesting ) then you wo n't VB a prophecy NN on it . Eclipses are far too common to form the basis of a prophecy NN every single NN they happen . But the 2017 solar eclipse is an interesting NN . Here are some of the factoids talked about this eclipse — along with my responses to VB you VB about them more critically yourself : • Claim : "" The next total solar eclipse in America is in seven NNS and forms an X when combined with this eclipse . These eclipses MD be marking out the seven NN Tribulation ! "" Response : Where does the Bible say to look for eclipses to mark the Tribulation ? Nowhere . What does it tell us to expect RB ? Jesus already VBD , "" when you VBP the Abomination of Desolation "" the Great Tribulation is next ( Mt 24:15 ) . Further , the seven - NN - JJ 70th Week of Daniel cannot start this NN as numerous prerequisites have not happened , IN the Nuclear Middle East War , Elijah 's coming , and most importantly the Good NNP of the Kingdom returning ( Mt 24:14 ) ( more on that below ) . • Claim : "" The solar eclipse happens the day before the start of the Hebrew month of Elul . "" Response : "" Day before "" is kind of random and arbitrary . MD n't the eclipse need to happen on Elul 1 itself if you VBP to connect it to the past historical prophetic events of that day ? That 's what was done in 2014 - 2015 with eclipses on the very days of Passover and Sukkot by Mark Biltz . This NN Mr. Biltz is happy enough with "" the day before "" to make a connection . This is a logical fallacy called "" moving the goal posts . "" • Claim : "" Jonah left for Nineveh on the day of Elul 1 after there was a major solar eclipse in Nineveh the month before . "" Response : VB above that the eclipse is not on the day of Elul 1 , so to be consistent , you must throw out any connection to Elul . As for "" the month before "" claim ( generously granting that the dating of this ancient event is reliable ) , why MD the Ninevites connect Jonah 's arrival with an eclipse an entire month before ? To reasonably expect NNS to connect an eclipse to something , that something needs to happen at the same NN , such as JJ as Jonah arrived and started warning . Again , moving goal posts . ( For a great depiction of something IN this , VB Mel Gibson 's movie Apocalypto and how a solar eclipse causes the pagans to VB plans immediately . ) • Claim : "" The solar eclipse is 40 days from Yom Kippur "" Response : Actually , it 's 41 days before Yom Kippur because it comes the day before Elul 1 which itself always starts the "" 40 days of awe / repentance "" before Yom Kippur , yes ? But RB if it was 40 days , so what ? Elul 1 comes every NN without event . Eclipses come every NN without event . Nothing in Scripture connects general eclipses with prophecy . • Claim : "" NNP War 1 started in August , 1914 the same month there was a total solar eclipse over the Ottoman Empire ( E. Europe ) which ended with WW1 . "" Response : Why is "" same month "" significant ? As stated above , it 's tenuous at best to connect an eclipse to any event that is not concurrent . Further , there have been half a dozen total solar eclipses in Europe since WW1 , so why have we not had WW3 - WW7 already ? Because this WW1 eclipse claim comes from another logical fallacy called cherry - picking data . • Claim : "" The last NN an eclipse crossed only the NNP NNPS was during WW1 on August 21 , 1914 "" Response : I guess the implication here is that "" trouble "" is coming again this NN ? If this is how it works based on WW1 , what happened to the total solar eclipse across the continent before WW2 ?? I guess there 's not much of a pattern here when you include all the data but instead just draw a circle around the data that fits your NN , RB called the Texas Sharpshooter fallacy . • Claim : "" The path of the solar eclipse passes over counties that 95 % voted for NNP "" Response : What , you mean NNP is using the Sun to highlight his approval of NNP ? Albeit only 95 % approval ... haha . I thought he was the Messiah , er , Cyrus LOL . ( I am not against NNP per se , just some NNS take their adoration of him too far , in my opinion . ) • Claim : "" The path of the solar eclipse passes over SEVEN towns called Salem ! "" Response : What , you mean NNP is using the Sun to highlight his approval of NNP ? Albeit only 95 % approval ... haha . I thought he was the Messiah , There are JJ , JJ more claims than this about the eclipse because , just IN with the 2012 Mayan Calendar speculation , as more NNS hear the idea , they perceive more connections of their own that spawn more NNP videos . The above most frequently repeated claims are enough to VB how arbitrary and subjective the "" evidence "" is for this eclipse being prophetically significant . Q : "" What are the odds ? It ca n't be just a coincidence ! "" A : No it 's not a coincidence but the odds are not as great as you VBP when you understand what it really is ! As the section above illustrated , the "" connections "" that are made to support the "" significance "" of the eclipse or other event use inconsistent rules . In other words , they use inconsistent rules and logic to connect whatever they can remember or imagine or Google that MD impress NNS . • If the event falls same day as a Biblical holy day ... bingo ! • If it comes the day before a biblical date ... close enough , bingo ! • If it comes the same month as something else big ... bingo ! • If it comes seven NNS before something ... bingo ! Obviously , when you employ flexible , moving goalposts or "" rules "" IN this , you are able to find interesting factoids for any event or date you VBP is significant . This is what happened with the 2012 Mayan Calendar date , and the 2014 - 2015 Four NNP Moons NN and we VBP how these turned out despite the claim , "" the odds of all these connections are astronomical ! This happens not because of legitimate coincides but rather due to a JJ psychological bias called Confirmation Bias . This bias causes us to ignore or reject evidence against our NN and accept and report all the evidence for it . RB when NNS present evidence against our NN ( IN this article ! ) their bias will use flexible rules and other moving goalposts to reject the evidence against it . For example , here 's another claim about the 2017 total solar eclipse regarding the name Salem : Seven towns named Salem . So what , JJ ? But wait , they VBD a verse to tie it to the eclipse . Drum roll again , please ... Look at that , will you , the word Salem is last part of the word Jerusalem and it's connected to an eclipse ! "" What are the odds ? "" The odds are very high indeed when you can "" cheat "" by matching any aspect of an eclipse to any part of any word in the Bible RB remotely related to an eclipse . Contrivances IN this only demonstrate the imagination and NN genius of the prophecy theorist to justify their event as important . They do n't provide any real Biblical proof that the event is prophetically significant . By the NN , real Biblical evidence for an event 's prophetic significance MD be along the lines of a direct quote from Jesus . IN him saying , "" When you VBP X , then the end shall come . "" Turns out Jesus VBD something exactly IN that , but not about an eclipse ! ( More below . ) Prophecy theories IN this are not just based on specific claims about a particular eclipse or other celestial event . The theorists RB quote numerous Biblical passages to justify their unusual focus on heavenly events in the JJ place . ( Again , VB the film Apocalypto for a reminder of how the pagans viewed eclipses . You MD say Christians fearing eclipses again today is "" retro "" but in a negative NN , much IN JJ NNP NN is retro . P.S. No judgment on the NNS , just the ideas they VBP and , too often , beat other believers up over . ) For an example of the "" heavenly "" focus verses they employ , look at this partial transcription of a "" biblical astronomy "" NNP NN and VB if you can spot any problems with the reasoning before I point them out : Sounds reasonable , does n't it ? At least to most JJ to prophecy NN . It 's persuasive enough for JJ of them to hit the share button and send it to others to VB warn them or ask their opinion . ( I VBP for me I only ever watch a prophecy teaching on NNP because someone shared it to ask my opinion of it . ) The transcript above leads to a false conclusion to justify looking to the heavens for NNP 's direction such as with eclipses . Here 's the problems with the arguments above : • Psalm CD tells us the heavens declare something , and it's a pretty broad concept at that : "" NNP 's glory . "" It uses a lot of poetic language ( IN anthropomorphism ) to emphasize this . But there is no literal speech or language or communication on that level from the sky . There is enough expanse there for humanity to realize NNP exists and to be "" without excuse "" in denying this fact and disobeying him as Paul VBD ( Rom 1:20 ) . That 's it for the normal , daily basis that the psalm is commenting on ( with CD rare exceptions , VB 3 below ) . • Because of this , the heavens cannot ever serve as a NN for NNP to "" speak "" intelligibly to his NNS . For nearly all of us , NN is just a random bunch of balls of light with different names , sizes and illumination levels . A few of these balls have vague or general historical meanings IN the Signs of the Zodiac do . What it means when they light up or crisscross is anybody 's guess , and guess away they do ! This is why there are a million and CD subjective opinions on "" what the eclipse means "" shared by prophecy theorists . • The Bible already answers the question posed on how NNP has and will speak "" to all his NNS "" when the need comes to do that : through his end NN prophet Elijah and lastly through seven literal thundering shouts of his voice ( Ps 29:3 = Rev 10:4 ) RB before he brings his Kingdom to NNP at the 7th trumpet ( Rev 11:15 ) . Oh , NNP can speak to all his NNS at once with clear , JJ language when he wants to . He did this with all of ancient Israel at Mount Sinai and they consequently asked him to "" please , stop "" out of fear ( Ex 20:19 ) . As you can tell , apart from NNP 's greatness , the heavens do not communicate much at all very clearly to us humans . This is why NNP uses several other much better means to talk to humanity . As noted above , all these means use actual , real , JJ language . If NNP spoke in a NN any less clear than that , no NN MD be held accountable to act on his instructions or warnings . They MD rightly claim they did not understand because his "" heavenly lights language "" was incomprehensible . But what about all those "" sign "" verses ? Does n't sign mean a message as with a "" For Sale "" "" sign ? "" Does n't NNP use the lights in the heavens to at least send simple informational warnings of end times events ? Not quite . Let 's look at the common verses that are used to justify drawing attention to eclipses and other heavenly displays . The thrust of Genesis 1:14 is that the heavenly lights MD signal common divisions of NN : "" seasons , days and NNS . "" In the Bible , the month is based on the moon ; months begin with the JJ ( crescent ) moon . Days begin when the sun sets or disappears . Stars in the sky VBP based on the season you are in . NNS RB can be marked by the solstices , or shortest or longest days of the NN . That 's what Genesis in context means by letting them be all things dealing with the calendar . It VBZ nothing about "" let them be for prophetic warning signs from NNP "" IN prophecy theorists wrongly wield ( proof - text ) the verse to mean . In both of these passages the word for sign MD RB be translated as "" miracle , "" "" token "" or "" wonder . "" Notice that none of those words convey the idea of "" communication / speech / warning "" as is portrayed by prophecy theorists . The point of the word is that there is a attention - catching display in the sky . It 's called a "" wonder "" because it makes NNS "" wonder "" due to it being unclear and hard to explain . Further , if you read Luke 21:25 in context , you do not find instructions to look for this sign to mean anything . It comes at the end of NNP 's wrath , RB before the Jesus appears . It 's certainly proper to have a nice heavenly fanfare before his triumphant return . By then we 'll already VB the day he 's coming . Revelation 12 goes on to explain the meaning of the great signs of the Woman and the Dragon . The Dragon is the constellation Draco and RB Satan . The Woman RB works at JJ levels including the constellation Virgo , Mary and saints of Israel and of the Church . It shows plainly that the Woman gives birth to the Messiah who later is "" taken up "" to heaven ( Acts 1:9 = Rev 12:5 ) . There is no connection in any NN given between the Woman in heaven and the end times events . Later after she is VBN on the NN fleeing from the Dragon , she is indeed an end NN character , too . The sign in the sky she portrayed earlier is never connected to her end NN actions and existence . When NNS make such a connection they read into the text what is not there , ignoring what is there as they did connecting September 23 , 2017 with Revelation 12 . As the previous section explained , when you look at the "" signs "" verses in context , they do not support the meaning for which they are used by Christian prophecy inventors . Each verse refers to a specific instance and application , such as calendar signs and the the sign on the day Jesus returns . They are not meant to give "" carte blanche "" or a blank check to justify "" scanning the heavens for any sign "" IN Christian theorists do . All that was obvious to me RB ago and I have written on it before . Thinking deeper on this topic , I began I VBP another problem . The meaning of the word translated "" sign "" in our English Bible versions does not support the definition that prophecy theorists use it for . Sign , IN JJ words , has several valid , possible literal meanings and connotations . A sign can have a short message in it IN a billboard or "" For Sale "" sign does ( "" $ 1000 call 555-1212 "" ) . Or a sign can mean something as limited as a signal light to indicate your engine is malfunctioning or that the day is over IN a sunset does . Which NN is the Bible intending ? Let 's clear up that confusion on the JJ definition of the English word "" sign "" to use : • Prophecy Theorists : Sign = "" communication or message from NNP "" much IN a "" billboard "" or "" NNP 's day timer "" ( to borrow from the title of Mark Biltz 's book where he teaches watching for heavenly signs on NNP 's calendar among other things ) . • The Bible : Sign = "" wonder , display , token , signal "" again , much IN a sunset or a car 's dashboard engine warning light . Here 's what the problem is with prophecy theorists ' portrayal of celestial "" signs "" with their limited and specific meanings in their context : It 's UH when our car 's designated engine warning light goes off and we decide it means we need to call our mom because she misses us . In other words , we reject the simple , limited , contextual meaning of the sign and expand it to be not just something else from left field , but a complete communication IN "" Aww ... Mom misses me . I need to call her . "" Meanwhile , all the engine light indicates is something quite vague and limited : something is wrong with the engine ! The final nail in the coffin of the approach of the prophecy theorists is that as they VBP about inventing JJ end NN signs based on NASA charts and historical factoids , they completely ignore the CD precursor end NN sign that Jesus gave us . That sign is VBN hidden away in a single , puzzling verse in the middle of the Olivet Discourse : "" This "" gospel of the Kingdom ? "" Which NN was that again ? "" Exactly ! Until 2016 I did not VB the answer to that , either . It had me stumped , too . It 's not our fault . Christianity does not teach any such "" this gospel of the Kingdom "" or we MD not respond with blank stares when asking what it is . Christianity certainly teaches "" good NN about Jesus "" just not the good NN of Jesus , you VBP , the NN that he taught on the rewards NNP gives NNS now who seek the coming Kingdom and NNP 's righteousness ( Mt 6:33 ) . VBG further , if Christianity did teach the Good NNP of Jesus already , Jesus MD not indicate it as an end NN sign . We 'd somehow have to VB exactly when it reaches "" all nations , "" which PRP can never VB for sure or easily . But if the Good NN message of the Kingdom died out with Jesus and the apostles , then when it reappears on the NNP in our NN , we then have a distinct clear and recognizable , unprecedented - in - 2000 - NNS sign . It will be so amazing that the worldwide spread of it in this JJ NN / NNP age is ensured . You wo n't be able to miss it . If you VBP to understand this important topic fully now , VB the NN in my supporters section . Finally , Here 's The Real Role of Eclipses In End NN Prophecy ! By the NN , the Good NNP of the Kingdom message will contain a built - in extra reason to "" obey it "" ( 2Th 1:8 ) . I 'm referring to the warning on end NN events . In our NN , you do n't just need to repent to be saved , but RB to follow NNP 's end NN escape instructions to survive what 's coming . Here 's the kicker . Interestingly enough , CD of JJ events of the end NN "" beginning of sorrows "" ( perhaps simultaneous with an earthquake or directly follow it ) that Jesus warned about affecting the whole NNP is ... But not just any eclipse . In fact , it 's VBG to be a weird combined , simultaneous solar and lunar eclipse : Joel and Revelation both agree that , somehow , both the sun and moon will be eclipsed at the same NN . Of course that is impossible today and I doubt most ( if any ) on NNP will be able to witness both . For a typical lunar eclipse , the sun and moon must be on opposite sides of the NNP . A solar eclipse at the same NN MD require another celestial NN to be very near to NNP in order to block the sun . Or perhaps the object blocks the sun for both the moon and NNP ... However exactly it happens , such a JJ foreign NN is identified by Revelation later ( and only after analyzing it 's JJ literal clues ) as a dwarf planet it calls Wormwood ( Rev 8:10 - 11 ; Note that the Greek word aster translated "" star "" is not specific to a star but can mean among other things planets of various sizes ) . Notice RB in context that RB this unprecedented combination lunar and solar eclipse does not happen as an isolated incident . A great earthquake , so great that it shifts the NNP 's entire topography significantly , RB occurs with it . Not to mention so JJ shooting stars that the normal starry night sky scrolls away . How is this possible ? The dwarf planet Wormwood is broken up at NNP 's Roche Limit and partially disintegrates . It can then literally "" fall from heaven "" upon the NNP ( Rev 8:10 ) . It 's dispersed slowly enough in small enough chunks to not end all NN on NNP RB then and there . Now is it a "" sign ? "" Revelation does not use that word but again , in the JJ meaning of the word sign , you MD say among the JJ "" signs "" of Wormwood is a unique double eclipse . But we 'll already VB it 's coming because of Elijah ( and already be in safety in Judea as Psalm 91 depicts ) . So in CD NN it is but the NN theorists look to eclipses to tell them the end ahead of NN , it 's definitely not . Seeing this all in context , can you understand how incorrect it is for prophecy theorists to quote those verses above to support their attention to isolated eclipses ( RB if four similar ones happen in a row ) IN they did in 2014 - 2015 ? Can you understand how it 's the same as seeing the dashboard engine indicator light VB on , ignoring its "" check engine "" - label context and deciding it means something completely different outside the car ? If you feel IN you 're done with NNP prophecy videos and ready to understand end NN prophecy literally , comprehensively and in context , including all the details on Wormwood ( 3rd trumpet ) and the rest of the seven seals , seven trumpets and seven bowls , order my book VB the Future and begin reading ( the bonus eBook version ) instantly while the softcover version makes its NN to you printed and shipped by Amazon 's CreateSpace in South Carolina .

The citizens of those NNS practice birth NN , which brought their birth rates down to 2.0 or less in the past 45 NNS . While Western thinking and intelligent action created stable societies , the rest of the NN roared ahead by adding 3.5 billion in those 45 NNS and continues with 80 million , net gain , annually , or 1 billion added every 12 NNS . And , no end in sight as humans VBP a projected 3.1 billion more within 36 NNS by 2050 .  Most Western elites continue urging the wealthy West not to stem the migrant tide [ that adds 80 million net gain annually to the planet ] , but to absorb our JJ brothers and sisters until their horrid ordeal has been endured and shared by allten billion humans packed onto an ecologically devastated planet . Dr. Otis Graham , Unguarded Gates Annually , 18 million starve to death and at least 2 billion live within the human misery index of daily NN and food scarcity . Notwithstanding , they keep reproducing without end , means or understanding . Those folks continue adding 80 million annually , so , in order to save themselves , they export endless millions of their numbers into stable Western NNS who chose 2.0 birth rates . In the meantime , not CD NN leader addresses it . Not CD Western leader touches the subject . Immigration remains the last taboo RB up there with the  NNP is flat ;  Adam and Eve constitute the JJ humans ;  the Bible is the final say ;  The sun and universe rotates around the Earth as spoken by the Pope ; and finally , lets not deal with global NN change or the fact that we face complete  Peak Oil NN exhaustion within 40 NNS . If we ignore it , the whole mess will VB away . Answer : not on your NN ! Some of us deal with immigration because it not only adds to Canada , America , Europe and Australias final horrific population expansions the added numbers from the Third NNP , when they reach the NNP NNP , they begin to quintuple their use of resources thus magnifying the NN footprint , NN footprint , resource footprint and NN footprint . Not by a little , but by an exponential growth factor second to none . Therefore , immigration into the West creates a nightmare . What might that nightmare mean ? It means the Third NNP keeps using the NNP NNP for a JJ exhaust vent . In the end , the West ultimately faces duplicating the Third NNP in overpopulation and resource usage . It wont be pretty folks . A reader responded to my last missive ,  Once again , someone claims that any focus on immigration to the NNP NNPS is a meaningless distraction . In effect , he - she is saying that the annual addition of more than 30 million consumers to the third most populous and industrialized nation on NN is irrelevant . Moreover , since all nations and all JJ citizens will be subject to an NN contraction , building walls will not insulate us from that impact .  This stance is not credible . If NN deliveries will contract , it is ever more imperative to contract the number of consumers in America , or at the very least , prevent the US population from growing . Each additional American citizen will reduce the per capita share of non-renewable resources . We MD not be able to solve the NN crisis , but surely we can't stand by and allow that crisis to be accelerated by an indifference to immigration growth .  He or she hopes to reduce population levels by a grassroots approach , by building a "" belief consensus "" for population reduction among target groups , IN "" grandmothers "" who are not in the breeding phase of NN . But how do you sell birth NN to NNS who look around and VBP their own communities bulge with immigrants , legal and illegal ? How do you tell the Smiths and the Jones ' that they should not have NNS when the Sanchez family down the block is having five ?  As CD of my critics VBD me , governments are determined to grow the population by CD means or another . If citizens choose not to birth NNS at a replacement level , then governments will import them . "" I prefer to have my own NNS than to outsource that job to immigrants "" , she VBD . This is a natural reaction . If you do n't reduce immigration , you can't convince NNS to remain childless in the interest of population NN .  BTW , regarding target audiences . Have you ever met a grandmother or grandfather who was n't absolutely delighted at the prospect of having a grandchild ?  Let 's VB real . Controlling migration is the most efficient method of controlling or reducing population growth . "" But how does that affect population levels ?  he or she asked . The answer is that open borders are a proven fertility stimulant to those NNS , which rely on massive emigration to relieve their population pressures and gain remittance money . The Philippines and Haiti are a case in point . Migration promotes JJ population growth . Fellow humans , this writer puts it into logical perspective . We cannot and will not survive our current path . I guarantee it . We better move this issue to the top of the national conversation . We must strive to write , speak and multiply our numbers and message . To argue or dialectic the issue endlessly and fruitlessly among ourselves gets us nowhere .

On Tuesday 's "" Pardon the Interruption , "" Wilbon criticized Curry , as well as the ESPN analyst Jalen Rose and the NBA reporter Marc J.

Kornheiser echoed Wilbon 's statements , RB naming Boston Celtics guard Kyrie Irving , who once VBD he believes the NNP is JJ . Kornheiser called Curry and Irving 's comments embarrassing to their families , schools , and to the NBA . "" This is anti-intellectual and it's anti-science , "" Kornheiser VBD . "" It should embarrass you , it should embarrass your families , it should embarrass the fine schools you went to — Davidson and Duke , in the same NN . It should embarrass the NBA . It 's not a position to take . "" It remains unclear if Curry was joking or not . Irving later rescinded his comments and apologized ."

Except it turns out not to be the only NN of its kind : through the NNS , online sleuths have VBN that all sorts of places do n’t exist . High on the list is Finland , the country some VBP lies between Russia and Sweden , and that allegedly fought a valiant rearguard action against Soviet invasion in the runup to the second NN war . This NN was RB born on Reddit , in 2015 . Finland , the user Raregan explained , was merely a fictional creation designed to create fishing quotas to aid the export of sushi to Japan from Russia . Last summer , another Reddit user suggested the Italian region of Molise – population 300,000 – does n’t exist , apparently as the result of an Italian in - joke , while Brazilians have had for at least five NNS an online NN that the north - western NN of Acre does n’t exist or else is a land that NN forgot , still populated by dinosaurs . The joke – or painstakingly well - evidenced and argued NN – that a country or region does n’t exist turns out to be CD of the oldest memes on the internet . As early as 1993 , German users of Usenet – a network of online discussion forms ( or bulletin boards ) , which predates the web – had a running joke that the Westfalian town of Bielefeld ( population 300,000 , funnily enough ) was a fiction maintained by the CIA , Mossad , aliens or some combination of the three . The joke has crossed decades , online platforms , language barriers and international cultures , and keeps coming RB . “ The beauty of memes is that they are malleable and everyone can have their own spin on things and VB involved in the joke , ” VBZ writer Mollie Goodfellow . “ I VBP it VBZ that we all VBP to be in on the joke , especially online , where often different cliques and subgroups can form . ” In these days of JJ NN and mainstream - NN conspiracies , though , it does n’t do to take anything for granted – so G2 contacted a diplomatic source , who agreed to speak off the record and confirm what they MD about the existence ( or otherwise ) of Finland and Australia . “ Hang on , let me look out the window , ” the source replied , before confirming Finland existed . The source was unable to provide similar confirmation for Australia ."

Now , CD separate studies show how the NN MD have been slowed down when it broke out in China if JJ distancing practices were implemented earlier . To VB how governments can better respond to the NN , CD separate studies have taken a look at how China initially handled it . Both indicate that the number of infections MD have been much lower — by as much as 95 percent according to CD of the studies — had the country implemented JJ distancing earlier as asymptomatic carriers pose a much more significant NN . As the source of the NN - CoV2 NN responsible for the outbreak , it RB has the largest number of confirmed NNS at over 81,000 at the NN of writing . In CD of the studies , however , researchers estimated that the numbers MD have been as high as 114,325 by the end of February . Early detection and isolation more effective than travel restrictions To take a closer look at how effective China ’s containment strategy was and how it MD have been better , a team at the NNP of Southampton in England built a travel network - based susceptible - exposed - infections - removed ( SEIR ) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China . The model was then combined with historical and real - real - NN JJ movement data from location - based services run by Chinese tech NN Baidu . Using the simulation , the team gauged the effectivity of the various non-pharmaceutical intervention ( NPI ) strategies used by China , such as quarantines and JJ distancing . Here , the team figured that , without the NPIs , there MD have been a 67 percent increase in the number of NNS . However , the NN RB VBD that had China implemented these measures CD , CD or three weeks earlier , it MD have reduced the number of infections 66 , 86 and 95 percent , respectively . This is on top of reducing the number of areas affected by the outbreak . What ’s more interesting is that the researchers RB looked at the effectivity of the individual NPIs . Of the various methods , it was early detection and isolation of NNS that proved to be more effective . This finding is in line with what ’s happening in China ’s close neighbor South Korea , which has largely kept its outbreak under NN , thanks to a massive testing spree but no travel lockdown . That VBN , the team is n’t downplaying the effects of China ’s lockdowns on its cities . The team stated that a strategy of coordinated NPIs has the strongest and most rapid containment of the outbreak . “ Our NN demonstrates how important it is for NNS which are facing an imminent outbreak to proactively plan a coordinated response which swiftly tackles the spread of the NN on a number of fronts , ” added Dr. Shengjie Lai , a NN fellow at the NNP of Southampton and CD of the authors of the NN . The results of the NN at the NNP of Southampton line up with those of another NN recently published in the journal NNP . This NN focused on undocumented NNS of NN - CD in China and how they helped spread the infection before the authorities MD contain it . These undocumented NNS consisted of NNS who either had only mild NNS of the NN or no NNS at all . According to researchers at the Columbia NNP Mailman School of Public NNP who conducted the NN , these NNS can expose a far greater portion of the population to the NN than MD otherwise occur . To asses the full epidemic potential of the NN , the team used a computer model to estimate the proportion and contagiousness of these undocumented NNS during the weeks before and after China ’s lockdown of the city of Wuhan . In this model , the spread of the NN across cities was then simulated using the mobility data collected by Chinese form Tencent from January 10 to 23 and January 24 to February 8 . Using the numbers extrapolated from the model , the researchers at Columbia VBD that 86 percent of all infections were undocumented before travel in and out of Wuhan was shut down on January 23 . The researchers say that these undocumented infections were more than half as contagious as documented infections . However , they were still the source for over CD - thirds of the documented infections . “ The explosion of NN - CD NNS in China was largely driven by individuals with mild , limited , or no NNS who went undetected , ” stated co-author Jeffrey Shaman , professor of JJ NN sciences at Columbia NNP Mailman School . “ These stealth transmissions will continue to present a major challenge to the containment of this outbreak VBG forward , ” Shaman added . In late January , China implemented a number of measures to stop the spread of the NN , including implementing lockdowns of cities such as Wuhan . The researchers acknowledged that these , alongside the public ’s heightened awareness of the outbreak and increased use of personal protective measures , have helped slow the outbreak down . NN MD become endemic , and return IN seasonal NN Despite the measures implemented by China , the number of undocumented NNS and their effectivity at spreading the NN has made the researchers question whether or not efforts by the Chinese NN MD be enough to contain the spread of the NN entirely . Shaman VBD that he felt it was unclear whether the reductions made by China ’s efforts MD be enough to fully stem the spread of the NN . He then likened the ongoing NN to the 2009 H1N1 influenza NN . RB VBN as the “ swine NN , ” the Centers for NNP NNP and Prevention ( CDC ) estimated this NN killed around 284,500 NNS . Shaman then stated that the NNP - CD NN , which has only killed 3,213 as of the NN of writing , MD end up following the pattern of the swine NN NN , which MD make it the fifth endemic NN in humans . The four current endemic coronaviruses , including the CD responsible for the 2003 to 2004 NNP outbreak , are currently responsible for an estimated CD - quarter of all colds . If this JJ NN does join them as the fifth , then NNP - CD MD repeatedly return IN the seasonal NN . “ This is VBG to be with us for some NN – it ’s endemic in JJ populations and not VBG to VB away without a NN , ” VBD Amesh Adalja , an infectious - NN expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for NNP Security , earlier this month . Adalja RB warned that the early spread of the NN in the U.S. MD have been facilitated by it being mistaken as seasonal NN , resulting in NNS not getting tested . With the JJ studies then , the NNS are hoping that the mistakes in China are n’t continued in other NNS and that the early , undocumented spread of the NN is arrested through early testing and JJ distancing . That , and if the NN ever returns seasonally in the future , NN officials are better prepared to deal with it ."

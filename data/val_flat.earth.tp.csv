She runs a charm school near Tel Aviv , and has a clientele of aspiring politicians , Foreign Ministry officials and former army officers , all seeking to unlearn traditional Israeli behaviour - aggressive , loud and rude . If PRP VBP I 'm being offensive , this is what she told an American audience : "" Israelis will cut in on your conversation and will often interrupt in DT middle of a sentence . PRP is RB quite common for an Israeli to complete your sentence for PRP . Israelis talk very loudly . "" Mrs Leibovitz , who spends her NN trying to convince Israelis IN being polite does not necessarily make CD a weakling or a dupe , told DT Guardian IN DT Middle East MD be saved by good manners : "" PRP have to see IN even Palestinians are human beings ... PRP do n't VB yet how to speak to other NNS and how to solve problems together . PRP have to learn DT . "" Judging by DT reaction of Israel 's Prime Minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , when he was invited to Norway to commemorate DT fifth anniversary of DT Oslo accords this week , peace remains some way off and Mrs Leibovitz still has work to do . Netanyahu , VBD his spokesman , was too busy . Besides , "" EX are more important things ... "" Someone yet to be selected MD be sent , DT spokesman went on , before adding : "" I do n't VB DT competition for DT is too fierce . "" Rude or what ? RECENTLY PRP learned IN DT true love of Simone de Beauvoir 's life was DT American writer Nelson Algren , with whom she carried on despite her decades - long relationship with her fellow Existentialist , Jean - Paul Sartre . He knew about Algren , apparently , and did not VB DT affair . But he had to put up with PRP , since he demanded DT freedom to have amours of his own . Reading DT transatlantic correspondence reminded me of a story told by my late aunt , who lived in Paris for JJ NNS and CD day found herself sitting at DT next table to Sartre and de Beauvoir in a cafe . Thrilled , my aunt leant closer to hear what two of DT greatest minds in France were talking about . DT subjects under discussion , PRP turned out , were their investments and their haemorrhoids . NOW I VBP DT Asian JJ crisis is serious . What brought this home was DT NN IN women in Bangkok 's sex industry are asking to be retrained in some other line of work . Thailand 's education ministry says PRP is setting up vocational courses after being approached by several "" dancers "" - for which read prostitutes - from Patpong , Bangkok 's infamous red - light district . Some have asked to be taught traditional Thai massage , an eminently more respectable branch of DT trade than DT practised in Patpong . What this key JJ indicator seems to show is IN , despite DT cheapness of international flights to Thailand , DT sex trade cannot manage without local custom .

But DT notion is much too mundane for Julian Barbour . According to DT 64 - NN - old British physicist , EX 's no point in trying to describe NN , because PRP simply does n't exist . "" DT passage of NN , "" he says , "" is simply an illusion created by our brains . "" This unconventional theory comes from an equally unconventional man . After completing his doctorate in physics in 1968 , Barbour balked at working in a university , where he MD have had to teach , worry about raising grant money and persuade deans to give him tenure . Instead he started earning money by translating Russian articles into English - - and did theoretical physics on DT side . DT riddle of NN had fascinated him all along , and about 15 NNS ago he tackled PRP in earnest . Recalls Barbour : "" I asked myself , ' How do PRP VB hold of NN ? PRP 's invisible ; PRP can't really VB your hands on PRP . So what is PRP really ? ' "" EX was n't any good answer . Although physicists work with NN all DT NN ( as PRP were ) , PRP never define precisely what PRP is . Barbour RB knew IN at least CD physicist , an American named Bryce DeWitt , had managed to meld general relativity and quantum mechanics into a single consistent theory - - a major goal of modern physics -- by removing NN from DT equations . But DT was generally considered a mathematical trick with no basis in reality . Barbour thought otherwise . Every "" moment "" PRP experience is real , he says , but these moments exist only for DT brief instant , during which NN literally stands still . DT passage of NN is as illusory as DT sense of movement created by DT succession of still frames in a motion picture . Most NNS are wary of abandoning NN , but Barbour 's idea is taken quite seriously by such respected physicists as Penn NNP 's Lee Smolin and DT University of Alberta 's Don Page . EX MD even be a way to test PRP experimentally ; a consequence of Barbour 's theory is IN DT universe MD be filled with more black holes and neutron stars than experts believe . If so , PRP MD VB within a decade whether his theory is supported by astronomical observations -- and whether DT ideas of NN PRP 've clung to for most of human history will VB DT way of DT ether and DT flat NN ."

NPS / Jim Peaco Most of NNP ’s history ( from DT formation of DT NN 4.6 billion NNS ago to approximately 541 million NNS ago ) is known as DT Precambrian NN . Rocks of this age are found in northern Yellowstone and in DT hearts of DT Teton , Beartooth , Wind River , and Gros Ventre ranges . During DT Precambrian and DT subsequent Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras ( 541 to 66 million NNS ago ) , DT western NNP NNPS was covered at times by oceans , sand dunes , tidal flats , and vast plains . From DT end of DT Mesozoic through DT early Cenozoic , mountain - building processes formed DT Rocky Mountains . During DT Cenozoic era ( approximately DT last 66 million NNS of NNP ’s history ) , widespread mountain - building , volcanism , faulting , and glaciation sculpted DT Yellowstone area . Magma ( molten rock from NNP ’s mantle ) has been close to DT surface in Yellowstone for more than 2 million NNS . Its heat melted rocks in DT crust , creating a magma chamber of partially molten , partially solid rock . Heat from this shallow magma caused an area of DT upper crust to expand and rise . DT Yellowstone Plateau became a geomorphic landform shaped by episodes of volcanic activity . Stress RB caused rocks overlying DT magma to break , forming faults and causing earthquakes . Eventually , these faults reached DT deep magma chamber . Magma oozed through these cracks , releasing pressure within DT chamber and allowing trapped gases to expand rapidly . A massive volcanic eruption then occurred along vents , spewing volcanic ash and gas into DT atmosphere and causing fast super - hot debris ( pyroclastic ) flows on DT ground . As DT underground magma chamber emptied , DT ground above PRP sunk , creating DT first of Yellowstone ’s three calderas . This diagram shows DT general ideas behind two theories of how magma rises to DT surface . Adapted with permission from Windows into DT NNP by Robert Smith and Lee J. Siegel , 2000 . Based on minerals from DT last major eruption , DT researchers found IN DT changes leading up to an eruption MD happen in a matter of decades rather than thousands of NNS in advance as previously thought . Supervolcanoes are characterized as volcanic centers WDT have had eruptions WDT covered more than 240 cubic miles . DT NNP has two : CD in Yellowstone and another in California ’s Long Valley . An eruption MD emit ash WDT MD expand over 500 miles . DT eruption MD likely cover DT ground with as much as 4 inches of gray ash , which MD be detrimental to crops growing in DT Midwest . Another less worrisome concern is DT 1,000 degree F molten lava WDT MD ooze out . Gases , including sulfur dioxide , which contributes to acid rain MD be spewed from DT supervolcano and DT JJ cooling issues associated with reflecting sunlight away from DT NNP are RB concerns . But EX are other supervolcanos in DT NN with sooner predictions than Yellowstone ’s . Campi Flegri , a name WDT aptly translates as “ burning fields , is in a “ critical NN , ” according to researchers in Italy . PRP consists of a vast and complex network of underground chambers WDT formed hundreds of thousands of NNS ago , stretching from DT outskirts of Naples to underneath DT Mediterranean NNP . Though its last eruption was in 1538 , PRP ’s due for an eruption soon . PRP MD be a minor event compared to DT 72 cubic miles of molten rock PRP spewed in its most notorious eruption 39,000 NNS ago , called Campanian Ignimbrite , WDT likely contributed to DT extinction of DT Neanderthals . Fortune website article reported IN if DT Yellowstone supervolcano erupts , PRP MD shoot out more than 1,000 cubic kilometers of rock and ash into DT air . DT ’s 250 cubic miles . DT ’s more than three times as large as DT Campanian Ignimbrite eruption in Italy , which created a sulfurous cloud WDT floated more than 1,200 miles away to hang over Russia . DT ’s 2,500 times more material than Mount St. Helens expelled in 1980 , killing 57 NNS . An eruption at Yellowstone MD result in a cloud of ash more than 500 miles wide , stretching across nearly DT entire western NNP NNPS . NASA has a plan to neutralize supervolcano threats however . PRP believe DT most viable solution MD be to drill up to 6 miles down into DT supervolcano , and pump down NN at high pressure . DT circulating NN MD return at a temperature of around 662 F , thus slowly day by day extracting heat from DT volcano . And while such a project MD come at an estimated cost of around $ 3.46 billion , PRP comes with an enticing catch which MD convince politicians to make DT investment . PRP MD become a source of geothermal NN . But EX are considerable risks , too . PRP MD trigger DT eruption PRP ’s meant to save PRP from . Historically , four types of volcanic events have taken place in Yellowstone ( PRP MD click on each NN to learn more ) : 1 . Caldera Forming Eruptions — 2.1 and 1.3 million NNS ago 2 . Lava Flows — about 30 between 640,000 and 70,000 NNS ago 3 . Earthquakes — 1000 to 3000 yearly ; last notable quake was in 1959 4 . Hydrothermal ( Steam ) Explosions — small explosions in DT 20th century ; a dozen or so major explosions between 14,000 and 3,000 NNS ago DT likelihood of an eruption in DT near future is still low . However those who instigate such a project will never see PRP to completion , or even have an idea whether PRP might be successful within their lifetime . Cooling Yellowstone in this manner MD happen at a rate of 3.2808399 feet a NN , taking of DT order of tens of thousands of NNS until just cold rock was left .

NNP becoming their next NNP and “ Making America Great Again , ” EX are those in DT Environmental movement and DT Scientific community , WDT are expressing their concerns . Some concerns are justified , while other concerns WDT are being voiced raise a “ Red Flag . ” PRP have to wonder how much of these expressed concerns are paranoia from those of “ left leaning ” political views … those with “ Junk NNP ” in their portfolios ( CYA ) … and still others with an agenda WDT will not hold up under DT light of day . Some environmental planners spend their careers mapping out worst - case scenarios . As of January 20 , PRP ’ve got CD in DT White House . EX ’s a case to be made IN DT NNP Administration ’s rollback of environmental regulation wo n’t be devastating ; IN market forces will prevail in DT coming NN revolution ; IN DT environment and JJ NN will continue to be protected under DT EPA and other agencies , and IN NN governments will do their part as well ; and IN a newly - elected NNP , self - branded as an astute businessman and dealmaker , will be open to DT wisdom of ensuring a safe and healthy America . But EX are two fatal flaws with this argument : 1 ) PRP were n’t born yesterday ; and 2 ) PRP do n’t come to this page to be lied to . DT NNP Administration ’s cabinet nominees and transition staff are a wall - to - wall collection of zealots , ideologues and latter - day Robber Barons . Their collective message , both stated and implied , is IN DT American NN ’s ability to protect DT environment , already besieged and underfunded , is on DT brink of oblivion . In early December , DT cavalcade of aspirants and celebrities seeking an audience at NNP Tower included two high profile NN activists , former Vice NNP Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio . Gore ’s visit was brokered by DT First Daughter - Elect , Ivanka NNP . DT NNP Administration ’s cabinet nominees and transition staff are a wall - to - wall collection of zealots , ideologues and latter - day Robber Barons . Upon exiting , Gore told DT press gaggle IN meeting with DT Trumps was “ extremely interesting . ” Combined with NNP ’s declaration to DT NNP York Times IN he had an “ open mind ” about NN NN , DT wilted spirits of environmentalists were revived . Kudos to Gore and DiCaprio for making their case , but now , let ’s return to NN reality . He ’s not let them down , helping to lead a battle — against DT agency he ’ll be in charge of if approved — on DT Clean Power Plan , DT Waters of DT NNP NNPS definition ( WOTUS ) . WOTUS and DT Clean NNP Act hold a particular irony , since DT anticipated assaults on Section 404 of DT Clean NNP Act MD make PRP easier to drain real , not metaphoric , swamps from coast to coast . A day after Gore ’s meeting , NNP announced DT nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt ( Pictured left / Credit : Gage Skidmore / flickr ) to lead DT Environmental Protection Agency . In his six NNS on DT job in Oklahoma , Pruitt has enjoyed DT support of keystone local industries , including fossil fuel and poultry . NN : Next was ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson , who vaulted past DT likes of Rudy Guiliani and Gen. David Petraeus for DT Secretary of NNP nomination . Months away from Exxon ’s mandatory 65 NN - old retirement age , Tillerson was a man in search of a hobby . Tillerson has acknowledged IN human - caused NN NN is real , and has endorsed both a carbon tax and DT Paris NN agreement . He ’s an Exxon lifer , with 41 NNS in DT employ of a corporation WDT ’s buried its own NN affirming NN NN , and WDT still funds NN denial groups . But do n’t VB he ’s inexperienced in NN or foreign policy . Steve Coll ’s must - read 2012 book “ Private Empire ” makes DT compelling case IN Exxon functions as a sovereign petro-state , leveraging diplomatic pressure in virtually every corner of DT NNP . All told , DT CEO of Exxon looks to be DT most progressive voice on NN NN in DT NNP Administration . DT CEO of Exxon . As Elizabeth Kolbert , DT Pulitzer - winning NNP Yorker writer observed , “ PRP have to be pretty desperate – and at this point JJ NNS are – to take this as cause for optimism . ” Related : He ’s no Ronald Reagan DOE : Editorial cartoonists and late - night comics love Rick Perry , who , as its potential boss , probably now remembers IN Department of NNP was CD of those agencies he ’d VB to abolish . DT former Texas governor is actually a big fan of wind power , which he watched become a booming industry in his NN . “ PRP can be proud IN Texas produces more NN from wind turbines than all but five NNS , ” he boasted upon leaving office in 2015 . He ruled over a bonanza in Texas fracking as well , and last NN joined DT Board of Directors of NNP Transfer Partners , DT builders of DT Dakota Access Pipeline . Perry ( Pictured left / Credit : Gage Skidmore / flickr ) has RB VBN IN NN NN is a NN to keep NN NNS as wealthy as PRP all VBP IN PRP are . While DOE has been home to groundbreaking clean NN research , DT bulk of DT department ’s mission and budget goes to maintaining DT U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile , and cleaning up DT immense messes left by their manufacture . Since leaving DT Texas NNP House , Perry has kept himself busy with an unsuccessful appearance on “ Dancing With DT Stars , ” and by turning back a criminal indictment for abuse of power as Governor . Step lightly , Guv . Interior : Ryan Zinke ( Pictured below / Credit : Gage Skidmore / flickr ) is a first - term Montana congressman who accepts IN NN NN is real . In DT past , he ’s called NN NN a “ threat multiplier , ” but IN Obama ’s NN strategies MD unleash “ catastrophic ” JJ costs . An avid hunter , Zinke says he ’d VB to see more intensive use of federal lands by both sportsmen and oil and gas drillers , and is expected to favor opening controversial export terminals to ship Montana and Wyoming coal across DT Pacific . He does have credentials as a “ hook and bullet ” conservationist , including support for DT crucial Land and NNP Conservation Fund . DT ’s earned him opposition from western anti-environment groups IN DT American Land Rights Association . He earned a 3 percent rating from DT League of Conservation Voters in 2015 . Unlike JJ on DT NNP team , he ’s voiced opposition for turning federal lands over to NNS . Rick Perry ruled over a bonanza in Texas fracking and last NN joined DT Board of Directors of NNP Transfer Partners , DT builders of DT Dakota Access Pipeline . Justice : If approved , Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions MD serve as Attorney General . He ’s VBN IN efforts to bring clean NN to developing nations MD be a veritable assault on DT NN ’s poorest NNS . He believes CO2 is a benign “ plant food , ” and famously launched a bizarre interrogation of EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy earlier this NN . Enough about DT NN / environment bosses . DT secondary players MD be considerably worse . JJ of these items are taken from first - rate reporting by Lyndsey Gilpin of High Country NNP , and research by Jenny Rowland and Erin Auel at DT Center for American Progress . DT CAP researchers documented IN nearly every key member of DT transition teams for EPA , Interior , and DOE worked for Koch - funded organizations or office - holders . NN : Thomas Pyle , a former lobbyist for both Koch Industries and DT National Petrochemical and Refiners Association , leads DT transition team . He currently runs DT Koch - and Exxon - funded Institute for NNP Research , a NN tank WDT ’s espoused a loosening of NN regulations and NN denial while denouncing wind NN . A special moment came on December 14 , when NNP transition team member Anthony Scaramucci appeared on CNN . Anthony Scaramucci , a financial CEO and Fox Business NNP contributor , mixed PRP up with CNN anchor Chris Cuomo in mid-December . Cuomo repeatedly asked his guest about whether NN NN is real . Citing Flat NNP Theory , Scaramucci took a deep dive into DT manufacture of doubt . Funny thing : Scaramucci was asked DT same question six months ago and declared NN NN to be “ irrefutable . ” For good measure , and possibly with his JJ boss in mind , he added back in June , “ I find PRP tragic IN so JJ NNS in this country believe JJ NN is some sort of elaborate hoax perpetuated by every credible scientist on DT NN . ” Other NNP Department transition officials include two more former Koch Industries lobbyists , Mike McKenna and Mike Catanzaro . Catanzaro RB served a stint as Communications Director for uber - denier Sen. James Inhofe . Team member William Greene is Deputy Legislative Director for DT Safari Club International , which has lobbied for trophy - hunting exemptions from DT Endangered Species Act . Transitioner Daniel Simmons comes from two Koch - funded groups , IER and ALEC . Somewhere on this DOE team , an unidentified someone has been “ counseled . ” Those were DT announced consequences for distributing a questionnaire to DOE employees WDT , among other things , sought to identify anyone at DT agency who had participated in NN - related meetings . After an uproar , and a refusal by current DOE staff to comply , DT NNP team disowned DT questionnaire and its McCarthy Era overtones ( In fairness to Senator Joe McCarthy , he was nowhere near as forgiving with DT Russians ) . NASA Transition head Chris Shank is DT # 2 staffer to House NNP Committee Chair Lamar Smith , and is expected to steer DT agency away from its vital NNP NN and NN NN research . Commerce : DT Commerce Department ’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is NASA ’s NN counterpart in NN research . Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross has made billions on rescuing and leveraging distressed companies , including coal , oil and gas firms . He ’s acknowledged IN NN NN is a thing , offering suggestions to boost rail traffic and invest in ethanol as NN fixes . Ross ’s International Coal Group owned DT Sago Mine in West Virginia . In January 2006 , 13 miners were trapped in an explosion at DT mine . Only CD was rescued . In 2011 , Ross sold ICG to Arch Coal for a reported $ 3.4 billion . EX ’s little indication IN NOAA ’s NN NN is nearly as much in DT crosshairs as NASA ’s . But , as CD former Commerce official told me , “ maybe PRP just have n’t gotten to PRP yet . ” EPA : Myron Ebell is a veteran political operative guiding EPA ’s transition team . Ebell dodges DT “ denier ” label via a few old NN - denial standards : In DT past , he ’s either VBN IN NN NN is “ nothing to worry about , ” or IN PRP will be awesome when fewer NNS die from DT cold in a NN NN . When hackers stole thousands of emails from NN NNS in 2009 , Ebell described DT NN NN community as a “ gang ” WDT was “ without honor . ” Multiple investigations cleared DT NNS of any wrongdoing . RB on DT team are attorneys David Schnare and Chris Horner of DT American Tradition Institute . Schnare and Horner have specialized in filing lawsuits and sweeping Freedom of Information Act requests against prominent NN NNS . Bankruptcy filings by coal companies have revealed their funding for Schnare ’s and Horner ’s work . National Security Team : K.T. McFarland , ( Pictured left / Credit : Gage Skidmore / flickr ) another Fox contributor , MD become Deputy National Security Advisor . She ’s denounced DT Obama Administration for citing NN NN as a JJ security issue . Monica Crowley , still another appointee drained from Fox NNP , will handle DT press for National Security Advisor Mike Flynn . She recently called JJ NN “ a way of separating Americans and Westerners from God and organized religion , and PRP ’s RB a wealth redistribution scheme . ” CIA : Wichita - based Congressman Mike Pompeo counts on David and Charles Koch as his constituents . He ’s been a business partner with Koch Industries through an oil supply firm , and has VBN IN NNP Obama is “ horribly wrong ” about NN NN posing a JJ security risk . Interior : Doug Domenech is a former Virginia NN official who blames DT “ regulatory war on coal ” for tough times in Appalachia , and says IN DT miracle mineral can relieve NN poverty . But coal jobs have been on a steady swan dive since DT Reagan Administration due to mechanization . Other Interior transition staffers include attorney Daniel Jorjani , who works for DT Koch ’s Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce . Authors Alyssa Katz describes this effort as having bankrolled anti-regulatory campaigns by DT U.S. Chamber and others with $ 255 million in 2012 alone . Congressional staffer Harlan Watson served as chief NN negotiator under NNP George W. Bush . A leaked memo from ExxonMobil , written shortly after Bush ’s inauguration , sang Watson ’s praises and recommended him for a role in NN policy . And a few more : As Transportation Secretary - designate , Elaine Chao MD lead on major infrastructure projects , including DT Obama Administration ’s plans to ramp up electric vehicle charging stations nationwide . Chao resigned her seat on DT Bloomberg Philanthropies Board in 2015 when DT charity decided to increase its support of DT Sierra Club ’s “ Beyond Coal ” campaign . She is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell – a helpful reminder IN sometimes , guilt by association means IN PRP ’re guilty . Linda McMahon , nominee for DT Small Business Administration , has cited “ conflicting NN on both sides of this issue . ” DT former NNP Wrestling Entertainment executive did n’t VB so far as to declare NN NN is fake and has a predetermined outcome . Senior Counselor Steve Bannon ’s Breitbart NNP site regularly touts NN denial . Bannon accused DT Pope of “ hysteria ” for embracing NN action . Domestic transition head Ken Blackwell believes IN NN models are rigged , and DT NN is a “ hoax . ” HUD nominee Ben Carson has VBN EX ’s “ no overwhelming NN ” on NN NN . Chief of Staff Reince Preibus VBD “ melting icebergs are n’t beheading Christians in DT Middle East . ” UN Ambassador nominee Nikki Haley fought DT Clean Power Plan as South Carolina Governor , even as her NN endured lethal , record - smashing downpours . And Vice NNP - Elect Mike Pence has at times VBN NN NN is real , but IN NN policy can’t impact PRP . But he ’s RB called PRP a “ myth . ” About DT author : For questions or feedback about this piece , contact Brian Bienkowski at bbienkowski@ehn.org .

She was visited by CD of her “ hybrid sons ” and was being prepared for a role as a messenger for DT Zetas ( Zeta Talk ) . Nancy eventually quit her full NN job in California and moved to Wisconsin to pursue her JJ appointed position as messenger for DT Zetas ( Zeta Talk ) . Official information from DT Zetas can be found online at Zeta Talk . Since 1995 , DT Zetas have been revealing to Nancy plans PRP have for DT human race as well as predictions of future events and catastrophes . In DT early 2000s , Nancy made a wrong prediction of an event occurring and lost a large number of followers , yet a close knit following still remains . DT belief is extraordinary because DT only evidence is word of mouth . Nancy Lieder is DT only contact with DT Zetas . She proclaims JJ elaborate facts of realities not yet known to mankind and is quite thorough in their descriptions . So far , Nancy has been unable to accurately make predictions of future events stating IN DT Zetas can be wrong sometimes ( Zeta Talk ) . Nancy RB does not have any physical evidence of DT existence of Zetas , but in a video she posted on YouTube , she describes a scene she experienced with a Zeta in such great detail IN PRP MD be surprising if PRP were not real . But , again , DT impressive detail and other anecdotal visions is DT only evidence of Zeta existence . In DT eyes of those invested in DT belief , Nancy Lieder has asserted herself in a position of high credibility and authority through DT telling ’s complex rules to live by , predictions of catastrophes , and enlightened happenings of DT “ aftertime ” where alien - kind and humankind openly walk amongst each other . Nancy , as DT contact , uses modern events IN JJ NN as verification of DT Zeta ’s predictions , which her followers believe . Those who are devout in their belief are misinterpreting real evidence of earthly phenomena as doings of DT Zetas . EX is a consistent community of Zeta believers on social NN , and those WDT participate in DT community are actively adopting this belief more and more into their self concepts . In other words , DT belief is taking up residents in their personal identity , which means IN being a part of DT group who is becoming who PRP are . When multiple NNS commune with each other in this way , a bond is formed amongst DT group and PRP becomes larger than PRP are as individuals . CD of DT most prominent aspects of Nancy ’s messages is DT “ aftertime ” and what life after death will look IN . According to Terror Management Theory , NNS will pursue meaningful experiences as well as beliefs WDT buffer against DT fear of DT inevitability of death . Since Zeta ’s messages expand into description of life after death , JJ NNS find refuge in DT belief IN NNS will CD day live amongst aliens . “ Return to Main Page . ” WHO ARE DT ZETAS , www.grantchronicles.com/zeta02.htm."

For starters , DT song ’s brain - numbing hook is somewhat infuriating in its own right . PRP ’s IN PRP was written for toddlers . However , DT verses make PRP clear IN DT actual subject of DT song is very adult and very sexual . Here ’s an example of suggestive lyrics : While Bieber is clearly not DT first artist to release a pop song with sexual innuendo , DT promotion surrounding DT single makes things extremely weird and uncomfortable . Whoever handler ’s Bieber ’s Instagram account decided PRP MD be a good idea to post pictures of random babies with DT hashtag “ Yummy ” . Here are some examples . Bieber ’s IG account contains JJ more pictures of babies . To make things even weirder , Bieber RB posted DT song ’s title with pizza letters . PRP is now a widely known fact IN “ pizza ” is a code word used in pedophile circles . PRP even became a meme in internet forums such as 4 Chan . To those who understand DT sick codes of these NNS , DT combination of DT song ’s lyrics with pictures of babies and DT word “ Yummy ” written in pizza letters is difficult to ignore . Another widely known meme associated with these creeps is pedobear . Here ’s another post on Bieber ’s IG account in DT midst of DT Yummy promotional blitz . To make things even stranger , DT music video adds another layer of “ what in hell ? ” DT music video takes place in a posh restaurant WDT is attended by posh - looking NNS . PRP ’s DT type of place NNS in DT elite MD VB to . At DT beginning of DT video , DT camera lingers on NNS playing music . While DT NNS are playing , Bieber enjoys weird food with some weird - looking NNS . Considering DT subject matter of DT song , PRP can easily interpret IN this orgy of food is actually meant to represent an orgy of NNS . DT close - ups of NNS suggestively eating food are not very subtle . DT final frame of DT video explains what DT food in DT video actually represents . DT frame is so symbolically important IN PRP was RB posted on Bieber ’s Instagram account . DT final frame basically says IN DT dishes represent NNS . PRP are being “ tasted ” . And Bieber is a victim of DT very system he is celebrating in DT video . What is Happening With Bieber ? Some might wonder why Bieber is partaking in this is creepy and overt child - loving stuff while he MD , UH , not do PRP . DT short answer is : He does n’t have a choice . Since DT very beginning of his career , Bieber was always an industry pawn , with little or no control over his career . As DT last frame of Yummy appears to say , Bieber himself might have been abused by creeps in DT music industry . Others wonder why Bieber – who is a devout and outspoken Christian – is partaking in this occult elite stuff . Indeed , EX are lots of Jesus - related posts on his IG account ( although weirdly mixed with creepy , Yummy - related pictures ) . However , to VB a better picture of what is happening here , PRP need to look at Bieber ’s church : DT powerful , star - studded Hillsong Church . DT Church is famously attended by various stars such as Selena Gomez , Kylie and Kendall Jenner , Kourtney Kardashian , Vanessa Hudgens , Nick Jonas , Hailee Steinfeld , and Bono . All of them are pawns of DT occult elite . DT founder of DT church Brian Houston RB has close ties with DT political elite of Australia . All of this elite endorsement happened despite DT fact IN DT Church has a dark secret : DT father of DT Church ’s founder Frank Houston admitted to abusing several young boys in Australia and NNP Zealand . And DT leadership of DT Church did everything possible to cover - up this sordid affair . Frank Houston , DT father of Hillsong Church founder Brian Houston , was a pastor in NNP Zealand and Australia who abused as JJ as nine boys over DT course of his ministry . In DT 1960s and ’70s , CD victim was routinely subjected to sexual abuse from DT age of 7 to 12 . In 1999 , his mother reported DT abuse to DT church . Although Brian Houston was legally obligated to report DT crime , he did not do so . DT victim later testified to DT Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse IN Frank Houston offered him AU$ 10,000 as compensation at a McDonald ’s in DT presence of Hillsong Church elder Nabi Saleh . During an internal church investigation , Frank Houston eventually confessed to DT crime . DT commission RB heard IN he was involved in DT sexual abuse of other NNS in NNP Zealand . Frank Houston resigned from his church in 2000 , which then merged with Hillsong Church . Contrary to what is stated in Frank Houston ’s resignation letter , he retired from DT position of senior pastor of Sydney Christian Life Centre in NNP 1999 and was never employed by Hillsong Church . A further internal investigation by Assemblies of God in Australia , in conjunction with DT Assemblies of God in NNP Zealand , found six additional child sexual abuse allegations , which were regarded as credible . In 2015 , DT royal commission examined allegations WDT accused Brian Houston of concealing his father ’s crimes and censured him for failing to report his father to DT police . In November 2018 , 60 Minutes aired a segment revisiting DT sexual abuse scandal , because newly revealed documentation allegedly reveals IN Brian Houston was deeply involved in a cover - up and IN Frank Houston ’s abusive behaviour was worse than initially thought . Brian Houston allegedly used his position within DT Assemblies of God in Australia denomination to conceal his father ’s serial child sexual abuse . DT matter was referred to DT NNP South Wales Police Force , which confirmed IN Brian Houston was under criminal investigation for failing to report a serious crime . Following DT 60 Minutes story , Hillsong released a statement in response to DT allegations . – Ibid . So , to circle back to DT title of DT article : Why did Justin Bieber tag babies “ Yummy ” on Instagram ? Because he is a pawn of DT entertainment industry which is controlled by some very sick NNS . Since DT beginning of his career , Bieber has been caught up in a never - ending whirlwind of strange , humiliating events and has often displayed bizarre behavior . He ’s always been a “ whipping boy ” of DT industry and DT face of crappy pop music . With Yummy , DT pattern continues . His handlers purposely turned Yummy into some kind of “ child - lover ” anthem by associating PRP with overt imagery and creepy Instagram posts . In short , Bieber was used to push CD of DT elite ’s favorite agendas : DT normalization and DT celebration of child abuse . P.S.

NNP YORK ( CNN ) -- PRP all VBP to live in a NN WDT 's clean , healthy and prosperous . PRP all VBP to hand DT NN off to our NNS in slightly better shape than PRP received PRP . No NN , even DT supposedly evil oil executive , has any reason to VB anything different . But , for some reason , PRP find ourselves searching for villains . Surely PRP exist , but DT endless quest to create them sometimes overwhelms our better judgment , whether intentional or not . Congress has picked "" Big Oil "" as their enemy of DT week . These companies inexplicably put profits above NNS , ravaging DT environment and financially assaulting DT poor to put another couple of dollars on their balance sheet . DT 's DT storyline PRP 've all been taught . Yes , times are tough for JJ . Sure , oil companies make a lot of cash . But , for DT money , PRP VBP PRP to work , VB ambulances to DT hospital , keep our homes warm , and employ thousands of our friends and neighbors while financing their retirement , paying their NN care , and providing NN to millions . Because of capitalism , PRP have DT incentive to do DT . I 've yet to see what our NN does for PRP with their rather large chunk of each gallon of gas PRP buy , and I 've yet to see them offer to return PRP or suggest a gas - tax - windfall - tax - tax . DT other villain of DT moment is DT JJ NN "" denier . "" Anyone who disagrees , even in DT slightest , must be ridiculed . On "" 60 Minutes "" last weekend , Al Gore VBD : "" PRP 're almost IN DT ones who still believe IN DT moon landing was staged in a movie lot in Arizona and those who believe DT NNP is flat . DT demeans them a little bit , but PRP 's not RB far off . "" Approximately 6 percent of Americans believe in DT fake moon landing theory , although I 've always heard EX was a conspiratorial consensus IN PRP was staged in Nevada , not Arizona . I 'm VBG to guess quite a bit less than 6 percent believe in a flat NNP , but no NN seems to be asking DT question in polls anymore , so I can't be sure . So , who are those NNS Gore was demeaning "" a little bit "" by these comparisons ? EX 's a good chance PRP 's PRP . DT 's because DT vast majority of Americans believe something WDT categorizes them as a flat earther to environmentalists IN Gore . Despite DT NN 's CD - sided view ( DT Business and NNP Institute says dissenting voices about JJ NN are outnumbered on CBS NNP broadcasts by a 38 to 1 ratio ) , only 21 percent of Americans say "" DT release of greenhouse gasses is DT most important factor causing JJ NN "" according to a 2007 NNP York Times / CBS NNP poll . DT "" 60 Minutes "" piece was n't just filled with misrepresentations of opinion ; PRP had plenty of Gore - style hypocrisy . He was embroiled in controversy when PRP was revealed his mansion used 20 times more NN than DT average American . His explanation ? "" Since then "" his house has been retrofitted with solar panels . I 'm sure Eliot Spitzer has n't been renting JJ women since he was caught either . ( Although I 'm not betting my life on PRP . ) PRP then see footage of Gore 's parents ' farm WDT will , sometime in DT future , be run on wind power . Apparently , DT windmill store has been out of stock for DT past 20 NNS . Perhaps most comically , Gore is seen dragging an entire film crew on a jet to India to give a NN presentation to about 100 NNS . Gore claimed : "" PRP just do n't have any choice . I wish I knew a better way to do PRP . I constantly ask myself , ' How can I be more effective in getting this message across ? ' "" DT most effective thing PRP can VB of is flying halfway across DT NN to speak with 100 NNS ? Maybe PRP had other things to do while PRP were RB , but I 'd be surprised if EX was anything essential WDT MD n't be accomplished with a telephone and a computer . DT NNS in India will be able to see your fancy graphs on their screens , and PRP 'll cut demand for those evil overseas flights . DT entire "" 60 Minutes "" piece felt IN a commercial for Gore 's upcoming commercials . He 's spending $ 300 million in advertising to convince NNS of something he claims EX is already a consensus on . To put DT much money into perspective ; PRP 's more than Sen. Barack Obama , Sen. Hillary NNP , Sen. John Edwards , Sen. John McCain , former Gov. Mike Huckabee and Rep. Ron Paul raised in all of last NN combined . VB of PRP as VBG green by getting lots of green . Where is all DT money coming from ? Gore says he 's donating his profits from "" An Inconvenient Truth , "" and his Nobel Peace Prize cash award . Let 's be generous and say EX 's only $ 290 million left to explain . Apparently , a follow - up question to find DT origins of this nine - figure sum MD have involved six seconds WDT "" 60 Minutes "" was n't willing to commit . What is EX to learn from all of this ? Whether PRP 's politicians on both sides of DT aisle or our vaunted environmental superheroes , DT quest for power overwhelms even DT slightest instinct of self - examination . In DT end , DT timing of DT Gore interview airing MD n't have been better . PRP fell on DT same weekend as DT first "" NNP Hour , "" when DT NN supposedly came together to turn our attention to NN NN by shutting DT lights off for an hour . DT imagery of monuments IN DT Sears Tower in Chicago , Illinois , VBG dark was plastered over newscasts everywhere . But those pictures highlighted DT JJ NN movement and DT congressional attacks on NN companies in an entirely unintended way . Behind DT darkened Sears Tower was DT city of Chicago , with lights shining brightly as far as DT eye MD see . For CD hour DT Sears Tower knew what PRP was IN to be Al Gore : A larger than life symbol , blocking our view of reality . DT opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of DT writer ."

Canada passed bird - friendly lighting ( and construction ) laws in DT mid-1990s , and now numerous cities — including Toronto , Washington , D.C. , and NNP York — participate in lights - out campaigns during peak migration seasons . And in 2016 , DT American NNP Association responded to DT growing body of evidence suggesting IN intense LEDs are harmful to human NN by recommending IN communities VBP streetlights to “ minimize and control blue - rich environmental lighting . ” Entire cities are even re-doing their lights in an attempt to reclaim DT night and decrease NN waste . Flagstaff , Arizona , was DT first city to be designated a Dark Sky Community by DT International Dark - Sky Association , and Chicago is in DT process of retrofitting its fixtures . So far , hesitations about dimmer , sparser lighting causing an uptick in crime or decreased safety at night have not been supported by DT data ; in Chicago ’s West Garfield Park , more brightly lit alleys actually led to an increase in reported crime . And anecdotally , NNS are finding IN less glaring lighting makes PRP easier to see in unlit areas , because our eyes adapt more quickly to DT dark . For some cities , eliminating light pollution is RB a way to increase tourism revenue while strengthening humanity ’s connection to DT night sky . Consider DT town of Jasper , Alberta . Nestled in DT remote Canadian Rockies , Jasper is a haven for those who love DT mountains , wildlife , and DT outdoors . Just a few minutes drive outside town , stargazers can see a dazzling array of nighttime wonders , from oft - hidden stars and satellites to meteorites and DT aurora borealis . Since 2010 , DT city has hosted a Dark Sky Festival in DT fall WDT brings in thousands of NNS . But Jasper residents are n’t content to have DT nighttime wonders visible only just beyond their borders . DT town is now working with Lumican , a Canadian company WDT partners with DT International Dark - Sky Association , to re-do all its streetlights . Slated to start this summer , DT town ’s roughly 400 fixtures will be replaced with shielded Lumican LEDs set to color temperatures ranging between 1,700 and 2,200 Kelvin , which efficiently cast an amber glow while limiting more harmful blue wavelengths . “ What caught our attention at first was how horrible all these JJ LED street lights looked ; so glary , prison - UH , and overly bright , ” says Lumican ’s Lara Mitchell . When she realized IN such street lighting erases stars and damages ecosystems , DT company turned toward fighting light pollution . Throughout North America and Europe , dark sky parks are on DT rise , and festivals IN Jasper ’s are flourishing . NNS are beginning to reconnect with DT sparkling canvas WDT swirls overhead just as technologies are becoming available on scales WDT will help humanity reclaim more of this natural nighttime majesty — if PRP choose to use them . Christopher Kyba , DT scientist who studies light pollution on a JJ level , points to van Gogh ’s “ Cafe Terrace at Night ” as his image of an ideal nighttime scene . “ This is DT dream of what PRP VBP to have — nice , warm , uniform lighting . PRP can see lots of stars up above , DT facades are unlit , ” he says . “ PRP look a hundred - something NNS in DT past to see DT idealized lighting . ”"

PRP write thousands of words to each other proving IN every obscure clue adds up to a big picture WDT only PRP can see . Just a few clicks away , other Reddit users are sure IN a secretive group — DT Illuminati — is part of a sprawling and hidden NN to control DT real NN . PRP do exactly DT same thing . EX are some clear parallels between fan NN theories and political NN theories . PRP were once confined to DT far corners of American culture , but in recent NNS have flourished thanks in part to internet message boards and social NN , which offer anyone DT opportunity to publish , debunk , rebunk and remix their own imaginary concepts and share them with RB - minded theorists . DT theories , however , share more than just message boards . DT psychology of groups and DT internet ’s propensity to amplify outlandish content and reward DT NNS who create PRP has created DT kind of feedback loops in which bizarre theories — from both fantasy fans and DT politically paranoid — flourish . Russell Zimmerman , 41 , a writer , game developer and military historian , loves to theorize about “ Game of Thrones , ” particularly DT books on which PRP is based , George R.R. Martin ’s series , “ A Song of NNP and Fire . ” But some theories are even too much for him , such as CD WDT argues CD character ( Varys , DT spymaster ) is secretly a NN creature . “ To me , DT 's about DT level of ‘ out RB ’ crazy - talk as assuming EX 's a kiddie porn ring in DT basement of a pizza shop without a basement , ” he VBD , referring to DT “ pizzagate ” NN theory WDT remains popular on DT fringes of DT far right . “ Thrones ” is not DT only show with a strong internet following and crackpot theories . DT popular Adult Swim show “ Rick and Morty ” has various fan guesses at DT show ’s secrets . BBC ’s “ Doctor Who , ” which follows a NN - traveling human - looking alien exploring DT universe , has its own theories . And in DT early days of DT consumer internet , “ DT X - Files , ” a show WDT often touched on real - life NN theories , gave birth to some of DT first online fan theories . Meanwhile , any number of real - NN NN theories have taken hold among various political and social groups on DT internet . Joseph Uscinski , associate professor of political NN at DT University of Miami and author of “ NNP Theories and DT NNPS Who Believe Them , ” VBD diehard fans and NN theorists share a love of extrapolating from DT facts in their possession . “ NN theories are similar to fan fiction in IN PRP both allow NNS to make up whatever PRP VBP , ” he VBD . Uscinski VBD IN whether PRP ’s “ Game of Thrones , ” “ Star Wars ” or DT JFK assassination , NNS can take a plot or an event and “ VB to wherever PRP VBP with PRP . ” As an example , Uscinski cited Qanon , a remarkably popular genre of NN theories WDT generally center on a mysterious figure who claims IN NNP Donald NNP is working to uncover a powerful group of pedophiles . “ PRP have this anonymous poster , Q , who puts out nonsensical clues and NNS try to make sense of PRP and try to figure out what happens next , ” he VBD . “ PRP are enjoying this . PRP VBP piecing these things together . PRP ’s a fan thing for them . ” Brendon Boutin , 32 , who runs a popular “ Game of Thrones ” recap channel , “ Man of Recaps , ” VBD DT excitement generated by both kinds of theories drove their popularity . “ I VBP DT biggest similarity is DT feeling PRP VBP , DT rush of hunting for DT truth and discovering secret knowledge , ” Boutin VBD by email . “ I watched some 9/11 ‘ Truth ’ videos back in DT day , and those brought about DT same thrill as discovering Jon Snow 's parentage . ” “ Game of Thrones ” is far from DT only show to have a fervent fanbase WDT has created its own theories , but few have created a community as rich and active , both online and off . Laurel Steinberg , a NNP York - based relationship therapist , VBD DT behavior shown by NN theorists and superfans is “ absolutely analogous . ” “ NNS VBP to feel part of a group , part of a movement , part of a team , ” Steinberg VBD . “ PRP feels good to have something WDT gives them a identity . PRP feels good to have something to be excited about , and watch develop in real NN . ” But “ Thrones ” fandom is RB susceptible to DT same internet dynamics WDT have spurred ever - more outlandish NN theories , rewarding NNS who can draw DT most attention . “ PRP 're able to create community , and then become an expert . PRP ’ve ridden DT tailcoats of DT star and then PRP become a breakout star in DT community , ” Steinberg VBD . ” PRP become an influencer . ” Chloe Ketchum , 27 , who co-hosts a podcast about DT series , “ Girls Gone Canon , ” VBD IN while she enjoys DT feeling of community around “ Game of Thrones , ” she ’s RB seen DT lengths some fans will VB to attract a following . “ EX are creators WDT push shock value to VB views , ” Ketchum VBD . “ NNS will do anything for attention . ” While EX are similarities in DT psychology behind intense fandoms and political conspiracists , Uscinski stressed IN PRP result in divergent behaviors . He VBD fans will generally abandon theories WDT do n’t hold up , whereas NN theorists ignore evidence WDT proves them wrong . EX ’s RB DT real - NN consequences . NN theories around politics and current events have inspired some NNS to commit acts of violence , which has led to efforts by politicians and activist groups to force internet platforms to reign in DT spread of DT disinformation WDT can fuel DT theories . “ When DT show comes out , NNS will disregard their theories WDT did n’t turn out to be true , ” he VBD . “ But with flat earthers , when PRP do an experiment and PRP does n’t show them what PRP VBP , PRP still hold DT belief anyway . PRP ’re much more invested ”"

NNP supporters had long dismissed concerns about her NN as baseless , insisting IN she only suffered from allergies . But Sunday ’s incident — along with a video appearing to show NNP having difficulty standing on her own — will only amplify such questions just as DT race enters its final weeks . DT incident RB MD increase pressure on NNP , 68 , and Republican nominee Donald NNP , 70 , to release more information about their NN . NNP has disclosed less than some previous candidates . Donald NNP has released almost nothing . “ This is DT kind of thing WDT voters have a right to understand before PRP cast a vote , ” VBD Katie Packer , a GOP strategist who says she does not support either NNP or NNP . “ Both NNP and Hillary are elderly . PRP are obligated to release full JJ records and full tax returns to DT American NNS . And DT NN , party leaders and American NNS should settle for nothing less . ” DT pneumonia diagnosis comes as DT campaign enters its most grueling phase , weeks before DT first presidential debate and as voters start heading to DT polls in NNS with early voting . Her doctor , who made DT diagnosis Friday , has advised NNP to curtail her schedule . But DT Democratic candidate did not appear to skip any planned events over DT weekend , including a fundraiser in NNP York headlined by Barbra Streisand . After DT incident , NNP ’s campaign VBD late Sunday PRP was canceling a planned trip to California on Monday and Tuesday for fundraisers and a taping of “ DT Ellen DeGeneres Show . ” NNP ’s lung infection comes after a tough week for her campaign , with polls showing a tightening of DT race against NNP . Then over DT weekend , NNP was forced to partially walk back comments she made referring to half of NNP ’s supporters as “ deplorables . ” DT JJ scrutiny of her NN will add to these problems . “ Forty - eight hours ago , this was something for DT Flat NNP Society and DT birth certificate deniers , ” Dan Schnur , director of USC ’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics , VBD of DT speculation about NNP ’s NN . “ Now PRP ’s a topic of legitimate , mainstream political discussion . ” Although NNP ’s opponents will surely make an issue of her having pneumonia , her campaign ’s relatively quick release of DT diagnosis marked a significant step toward transparency for a candidate who has often shied away from disclosing information she considers private . But some critics complained IN NNP did not reveal DT potentially debilitating condition Friday when PRP was diagnosed . And after she fell ill Sunday morning , her campaign initially attributed PRP to “ overheating ” and waited nearly seven hours — as rumors and speculation about her NN swirled — until disclosing DT pneumonia . For NNP , perhaps DT most damaging part of DT day was DT CD - second video of her struggling to leave DT event in NNP York City . DT video , quickly circulated online and replayed on cable NN channels , shows her standing uneasily , her knees appearing to buckle and needing help to VB into her van . A spokesman VBD immediately afterward IN NNP left DT ceremony at DT site of DT NNP Trade Center about 9:30 a.m. because she felt unwell . Reporters who were traveling with NNP were not told about her condition or her whereabouts for 90 minutes after she left DT ceremony . “ Secretary NNP attended DT Sept. 11th commemoration ceremony for just an hour and 30 minutes this morning to pay her respects and greet some of DT families of DT fallen , ” spokesman Nick Merrill VBD in DT initial statement released by DT campaign . “ During DT ceremony , she felt overheated so departed to VB to her daughter ’s apartment , and is feeling much better . ” DT weather was in DT low 80s and humid . NNP spent about two hours at Chelsea NNP ’s apartment and emerged shortly before noon wearing sunglasses , greeting a young girl and waved at diners at a nearby restaurant . “ I ’m feeling great . PRP ’s a beautiful day in NNP York , ” NNP VBD before heading to her home in Chappaqua , N.Y . Her personal physician examined her at her house Sunday afternoon and VBD NNP was recovering . “ While at this morning ’s event , she became overheated and dehydrated . I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely , ” VBD Dr. Lisa R. Bardack in a statement . Bardack VBD NNP was put on antibiotics Friday . NNP ’s NN has long been DT speculation of NN theorists . In 2014 , a NNP magazine cover of NNP in her backyard leaning on a chair prompted speculation IN she was leaning on a walker . But innuendo about her NN grew markedly during DT presidential campaign as NNP and his surrogates , including former NNP York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani , routinely questioned her strength and stamina on DT campaign trail . NNP was uncharacteristically silent Sunday after NN of NNP ’s illness emerged . Republicans have RB pointed to coughing fits IN NNP has suffered while campaigning , and which she attributes to seasonal allergies . Her opponents have RB raised questions about DT effect of a concussion she sustained in 2012 . DT drumbeat got to DT point IN NNP poked fun at PRP on late - night television . During an August appearance on “ Jimmy Kimmel Live , ” she pretended to exert great effort as she opened a jar of pickles and asked DT host to check her pulse . NNP dismissed DT attacks as “ wacky ” and noted IN critics have claimed “ I MD be dead in six months , ” she VBD . “ So with every breath I take I feel IN I have a JJ lease on life . ” For DT latest on national and California politics , follow @LATSeema on Twitter .

JJ ancient cultures subscribed to DT idea but PRP was made famous again in modern times thanks to DT creation of a Flat NNP society by Samuel Shenton in 1956 . Mark Sargent , an avid member of DT club and author of several books on DT topic , revealed CD reason why he believes PRP is more than just a NN . Speaking during Netflix documentary “ Behind DT Curve ” , Mr Sargant claimed his theory was superior to everything NASA has told PRP for NNS . Taking DT production crew to a beach near his home , Mr Sargant pointed at DT city of Seattle across DT NN . He VBD in 2018 : “ Here ’s an example if PRP VBP to see PRP real quick . “ So UH DT buildings in DT distance – right out RB – DT is Seattle . “ PRP should not be able to see PRP . “ EX should be hundreds of feet of curvature between PRP and them . ” Mr Sargant went on to dismiss any scientific reasoning for DT revelation , before claiming DT Flat NNP theory answers all DT questions . He added : “ PRP can say PRP ’s refraction , or PRP ’s atmospheric effects , no – not in every weather condition , not in every light condition . “ This is why NN is having a problem combating what PRP are doing . “ Neil deGrasse Tyson says PRP ’s a growing anti-intellectual movement which borders on DT end of civilisation as PRP VBP PRP . “ But DT reason why PRP ’re winning versus NN , is NN just throws back maths . Neil deGrasse Tyson is an American astrophysicist author and leading NN figure . He has been a long NN supporter of NASA , claiming DT space agency deserves more funding and backing by DT general NN . In March 2012 , he testified before DT NNP NNPS Senate NNP Committee , stating : "" Right now , NASA 's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar . "" For twice DT – a penny on a dollar – PRP can transform DT country from a sullen , dispirited nation , weary of JJ struggle , to CD where PRP has reclaimed its 20th - century birthright to dream of tomorrow . "" Mr Tyson RB runs his own YouTube channel – StarTalk – where he has previously called out Flat Earthers . He VBD in March 2018 : “ PRP have videos from space of DT rotating spherical NNP – DT NNP is round ."

Mick Jagger MD excite DT NN in CD note , while Thomas Friedman needs 461 pages to say , “ Shit happens . ” Joan of Arc and Charles Manson had more in common . Thomas Friedman was once a man of great influence . His columns were must - reads for every senator and congressperson . He helped spread DT globalization gospel and push PRP into war in Iraq . But he ’s destined now to be more famous as a literary figure . No modern writer has been lampooned more . Hundreds if not thousands of man-hours have been spent teaching robots to produce automated Friedman - prose , in what collectively is a half - vicious , half - loving tribute to a man who raised bad writing to DT level of an art form . PRP will remember Friedman for interviewing 76 percent of DT NN ’s taxi drivers , for predicting “ DT next six months will be critical ” on 14 occasions over two and a half NNS ( birthing DT neologism , “ DT Friedman unit “ ) , and for his unmatched , God - given ability to write nonsensical metaphors , IN his classic “ rule of holes ” : “ When PRP ’re in CD , stop digging . When PRP ’re in three , bring a lot of shovels . ” Friedman ’s great anti-gift is his ability to use JJ words when only a few are necessary . He became famous as a newspaper columnist for taking simple CD - sentence observations IN , “ Wow , everyone has a cell phone these days , ” and blowing them out into furious 850 - word trash - fires of mismatched imagery and circular argument . DT double - axel version of this feat was to then rewrite DT same column over and over again , in DT same newspaper , only piling on more incongruous imagery and skewing rhetoric to further stoke DT CD thought into an even higher and angrier fire . For nearly two decades now , Friedman has been telling PRP IN something big is happening , technology is growing at a rate beyond DT ability of humans to adapt ( this is where DT part about noticing everyone has a cell phone comes in ) , and IN PRP have to stop doing things DT old way and take a brave step into DT future . He wrote this column so JJ times IN even four NNS ago – eight Friedman units – Hamilton Nolan wrote a piece in Gawker titled “ Thomas Friedman writes his only column again ” ( Friedman ’s “ only column ” has by now outlived hundreds of NN outlets , Gawker and my own NNP York Press among them ) . Nolan cited a piece in DT Times called “ DT Rise of Popularism , ” in which Friedman argued , again , IN technology was racing past humanity ’s ability to govern itself wisely . A very conservative guess is IN Friedman has written this column at least a hundred times . Maybe 200 . Maybe more . If PRP ’re rolling your eyes at this , check yourself . VB about what an awesome accomplishment WDT is . PRP takes an extraordinary discipline to turn CD sentence of thought into hundreds of thousands of words . PRP all repeat ourselves in DT punditry business . Most of PRP only have a few ideas . Friedman has fewer than most – PRP ’s really just CD , technology future derp ! – but he ’s attacked IN CD idea with such relentless evangelical NN WDT he is leaving behind as a monument to PRP DT literary equivalent of DT Giza pyramid complex . This decades - long gigantic art project is based upon a vast architecture of needless complication , a process he describes in this JJ book of his , Thank PRP for Being Late , as “ translating English into English . ” Build a sentence into a column ; build a column into JJ columns ; build JJ columns into a book ; build CD book into JJ books . Then start over ! Eleven NNS ago , when Friedman wrote his seminal explainer book , DT NNP is Flat – a book whose title metaphor was hilariously based on DT wrong premise IN NNS are more interconnected on a flat NN than on a round CD – he combined two giant sets of metaphors to describe DT same idea IN technology was outpacing our ability to govern ourselves . He VBD rapid changes in DT NN were being fueled by 10 “ flatteners ” ( things IN DT end of communism , Netscape , outsourcing , etc. ) which in turn were amplified by he VBD were four “ steroids ” : Digital , Mobile , Personal and Virtual . Those four steroids actually turned out to be six – changing or extending DT terms of his imagery midstream is a classic Friedmanism – and DT sixth “ steroid , ” JJ wireless devices , was actually a JJ group of steroids he called “ uber-steroids . ” This was confusing because DT tenth item in Friedman ’s list of “ flatteners ” was DT group of four steroids . So his last flattener was a JJ group of steroids and his last steroid was a JJ group of uber - steroids . Which meant PRP had uber - steroids amplifying steroids amplifying flatteners , with each list comprising items WDT belonged to other lists . He mashed all of DT together for 470 pages or so . Eleven NNS and countless columns later , DT JJ book Thank PRP for Being Late takes DT same structure and boldly complicates PRP . This book is built , again , around DT idea IN technological NN is advancing beyond our ability to adapt . DT culprits this NN are three great “ Accelerations ” : Moore ’s Law ( microchip processing power doubles every 18 to 24 months ) , DT market ( globalization ) and Mother Nature , which is his English - language term for DT English - language term , “ NN NN and biodiversity loss . ” These Three Accelerations in turn are transforming five key “ realms , ” which he lists as “ DT workplace , politics , geopolitics , ethics , and DT community . ” If PRP ’re wondering what ’s left over when PRP subtract , from DT subset of all things , “ DT workplace , politics , geopolitics , ethics , and DT community , ” PRP ’re on to something . Because PRP turns out IN DT book is about how something is happening to – everything ! “ In short , ” Friedman says , in DT opening chapter of Late , “ this book is CD giant column about DT NN today . ” Incidentally , whenever Friedman uses DT phrase , “ In short … ” he ’s about to take DT short form of an idea and make PRP longer , e.g . “ In short , DT only way for Mexico to thrive is with a strategy of reform retail WDT will enable PRP to beat NNP to DT top , not DT bottom , because NNP is not focused on beating Mexico as much as PRP is on beating America . ” To his credit , in Thank PRP for Being Late , Friedman debuts DT use of , “ To make a short story long , ” which is n’t exactly fixing DT problem . But PRP is funnier . So how giant is this JJ giant column ? Really giant . EX are n’t enough drugs in DT NN to VB anyone through Thank PRP for Being Late in CD sitting . Take DT chapter about Mother Nature , which opens with a story about a day in July , 2015 when DT heat index in southern Iran reached 163 degrees . DT NN item gives DT author an opening to introduce DT concept of a “ black elephant , ” an ominous ( if PRP VBP Friedman ) term apparently explained to him by environmentalist Adam Sweidan : “ [ PRP is ] a cross between a ‘ black swan ’ – a rare , low - probability , unanticipated event with enormous ramifications – and ‘ DT elephant in DT room ’ : a problem WDT is widely visible to everyone , yet IN no NN wants to address , even though PRP absolutely VBP IN CD day PRP will have vast , black - swan - JJ consequences . ” PRP MD VB he MD just say , “ DT NN NN problem is a cross between a black swan and DT elephant in DT room – or , as I VBP to call PRP , a Black Elephant . ” Instead he leads audiences through drawn - out explanations of two everyday terms . Moreover his unnecessary definition of “ DT elephant in DT room ” contains DT phrase “ black swan , ” making what was originally a relatively simple idea now a kind of circular movie - within - a - movie image WDT is more than a little hard to follow : “ A black elephant is a cross between a black swan event and DT elephant in DT room , which is an ignored but visibly obvious problem WDT will inevitably become a black swan event . ” PRP ’re still grappling with DT when PRP learn “ EX are a herd of environmental black elephants out RB . ” Friedman names at least four : JJ NN , deforestation , ocean acidification and mass biodiversity extinction . He quotes Sweidan as saying of these : “ When PRP hit , PRP ’ll claim PRP were black swans WDT no NN MD have predicted , but in fact PRP were black elephants , very visible right now . ” Friedman just got finished telling PRP IN a black elephant is half black swan , and half elephant in DT room WDT will inevitably become a black swan . But now IN half - swan , half swan - within - an - elephant is being contrasted with a black swan : in DT near future , things WDT are really black elephants will be misidentified as black swans . So DT ’s weird . While PRP ’re sorting DT out , Friedman tells PRP IN DT PRP IN a 163 - degree heat index in Iran is another black elephant , because “ PRP can see PRP sitting in a room , PRP can feel PRP , and PRP can read about PRP in DT newspaper . ” He adds : “ IN any black elephant , PRP RB VBP IN PRP is so far outside DT norm IN PRP has all DT characteristics of a black swan – IN PRP is DT harbinger of some very big , unpredictable changes in our NN system PRP MD be unable to control . ” DT next thing he says is IN PRP spend tons of money preparing for DT relatively unlikely event of nuclear war , but virtually nothing to prevent a very likely NN NN catastrophe . He MD have just led DT chapter with DT . But DT MD defeat DT purpose of translating English into English . PRP ’re still wondering what happened to DT elephant reading a newspaper about a black swan roasting in DT desert when Friedman moves on to DT next space - devouring exercise , telling PRP about DT four phrases PRP need to master to learn “ NN - speak . ” All four sound IN DT same idea and are immediately forgettable : “ Just a few NNS ago … but then something changed . ” “ Wow , I ’ve never seen DT before . ” “ Well , usually , but now I do n’t VB anymore . ” “ PRP have n’t seen anything IN DT since . ” Quick , name any of those phrases PRP just read . PRP can ’t ! But PRP “ have to master ” all of them to grasp DT rapidity of NN disturbances , which Friedman now describes as Mother Nature moving into DT “ second half of DT chessboard . ” This is a reference to a metaphor from an earlier chapter recalling DT ancient tale of DT mathematician who asked a king for a reward . DT master asked to have CD grain of rice put on CD corner of a chessboard , and then to have twice as JJ put on DT next square , and to keep VBG , on and on to DT end . DT punchline is IN after doubling down 64 times , PRP end up with 18 quintillion grains of rice or something – more than PRP ’d have guessed ! Which is a metaphor for how much faster than PRP VBP is DT pace of NN all around PRP , be PRP in technology , JJ displacement or , in this case , DT environment . Did PRP VB IN “ megatoothed sharks prowled DT oceans ” DT last NN DT CO2 concentration in DT NN ’s atmosphere was as high as PRP was in Hawaii on NNP 3rd , 2013 , an astonishing four hundred parts per million ? PRP probably did n’t , because things WDT prowl usually have feet – but anyway , back to DT elephants : “ And sometimes DT records being broken as Mother Nature enters DT second half of DT chessboard are so numerous and profound , NN agencies tracking them seem to run out of even NN - speak to describe DT black elephants PRP are seeing . ” This must be DT talent for “ boiling things down ” WDT Mr. Micklethwait talked about ! God bless this man . MD he never stop writing books . Let ’s grow this pie as big as PRP can . P.S. winners of DT extraordinary # friedmangraphs contest to be announced soon .

DT VBN , DT topic is certainly a fresh NN for Twitter beef . NNS have recognized DT curvature of DT NNP for more than 2,000 NNS . But rapper B.o.B. challenged DT view on Sunday when he began tweeting images and diagrams WDT he VBD were proof DT NNP is as flat as a 45 . Did PRP mention B.o.B. is promoting a JJ album ? Well he is . But he insists those things are definitely not related . So far , B.o.B. -- nee Bobby Ray Simmons -- has posted almost 50 images of DT supposedly flat NN , along with quotes from DT 2014 book “ DT Flat NNP NNP ” by Eric Dubay . Thousands of fans retweeted B.o.B. ’s claims IN “ I ’m VBG up against DT greatest liars in history ... PRP ’ve been tremendously deceived ” and “ I question DT international laws WDT prevent PRP from exploring Antartica and DT North Pole ... what ’s EX to hide ? ” Usually , when a prominent scientist steps forward to set DT record straight , DT ’s DT end of DT conversation . But not for B.o.B . He tweeted a song he ’d written , “ Flatline , ” in which he insists “ Neil Tyson need to loosen up his vest ” and ponders why NASA is part of DT Department of Defense . ( Actually , PRP ’s not . ) Then , in a move B.o.B. probably did n’t see coming , Tyson dropped a diss track back at him . DT rapper Tyson was referring to was his nephew , Steve Tyson , who goes by “ Tyson . ” He wrote and recorded DT song “ Flat to Fact . ” In an interview with DT Times , Tyson DT rapper VBD he came up with DT idea of writing a song in his famous uncle ’s defense after texting with him Tuesday morning “ I recorded PRP in my living room , ” Tyson VBD . “ I wrote PRP in a couple hours and just hit record and started recording PRP as a track . ” His uncle recorded himself reading some of his tweets to use in DT song . Not everyone was persuaded . JJ followers s eemed eager to jump on DT flat NNP bandwagon B.o.B. was all too eager to retweet them . Perhaps Laura Danly will be more convincing . DT curator of DT Griffith Observatory , kindly agreed to address a few of B.o.B. including why PRP ca n’t see DT curvature of DT NNP . “ DT NNP is just big , ” she VBD . “ PRP look out to DT horizon and PRP looks flat . But if PRP VBP into space PRP can see DT curvature . ” B.o.B. asserts IN PRP have no photos of a curved NNP WDT were n’t “ taken ” by NASA . DT ’s not true either : DT NNP , including NNP in 2014 and Japan just last NN . Other things WDT prove DT NNP is round : DT fact IN PRP can observe sunrises and sunsets . DT fact IN NNS in different hemispheres see different constellations . DT fact IN PRP can fly around PRP in a straight line . So for DT record , DT NNP : definitely round .

Over DT course of DT early modern period , DT ‘ space ’ of DT Netherlands opened up in several productive ways . Perhaps most famously , DT Dutch created DT JJ space of DT Republic : viable political space , demarcated from an older collection of provinces , which had been gathered most recently under DT auspices of DT king of Spain . DT Dutch RB expended tremendous effort reconstituting DT physical space of DT Low NNPS : land reclaimed from NN and increased urban centres , which allowed DT Republic to grow in population and gain in arable terrain . And DT Dutch enlarged their commercial and colonial space by dint of their numerous overseas expansions : a ‘ NNP ’ Netherland ( almost always referred to in singular form ) , which arose on DT eastern shores of what was already then called North America ; a modern ‘ Batavia ’ , which emerged in present‐day Indonesia ; and a host of Dutch forts and settlements WDT otherwise dotted DT coasts and islands of Asia , Africa and DT Americas . DT Dutch RB developed , just as famously , JJ pictorial devices to engage with space – DT painterly and printerly techniques explored in this issue – and , not unrelated , JJ techniques to map spaces : DT most robust cartographic ateliers of early modern Europe , which developed first in Antwerp and then in Amsterdam from DT late sixteenth century , coincident with DT rise of DT Dutch Republic and DT Golden Age of Dutch visual culture . Maps proliferated in DT early modern Netherlands . PRP offered a means both to delineate space and to narrate space – to explicate how space works and to assert where their makers ( and consumers ) fit within these spaces . Yet maps were RB important and ubiquitous material objects in DT Netherlands , which occupied myriad additional spaces and which played with DT JJ spatial and material concerns of their viewers . PRP engaged viewers and enticed them into their interpretive spaces . How do Dutch maps work , and what does this reveal about DT visual culture of DT early modern Netherlands ? These questions were famously tackled by Svetlana Alpers in DT Art of Describing mostly in regard to landscape painting . Yet in JJ ways , her influential essay on ‘ DT Mapping Impulse in Dutch Art ’ – DT NN ‐to source for non ‐Dutch specialists , particularly historians of NN who seek to affiliate their concerns with habits of natural ‐history representation with a broadly northern European tradition of painting – curiously avoided DT key to this intriguing interpretive palace : DT maps themselves and how PRP actually function . 1 While Alpers ’ oft‐cited chapter does open with Vermeer 's Allegory of Painting and DT impressive wall map by Claes Jansz . Visscher WDT amply fills its background , maps are otherwise relegated to DT side , treated sparingly and elliptically at best – at least DT form of artfully designed , lavishly embellished and meticulously printed maps WDT enjoyed such phenomenal popularity in DT Netherlands from DT late sixteenth through at least DT early eighteenth century . Maps do matter , and , as Alpers astutely points out , cartographic materials played a significant and instructive role in DT visual , social and indeed DT political culture of DT early modern Dutch Republic . PRP were ubiquitous in more ways than CD : as décor in houses and paintings ; as devices of learning and social standing ; as NN of cultural and political messaging . In a vital sense , however , these roles remain conspicuously absent in her analysis , inadequately problematized and not at all ‘ deconstructed ’ – to invoke DT language of DT JJ critical cartography WDT was being developed precisely when Alpers was formulating her insights into Dutch visual culture . 2 Maps as productive sources ( as opposed to theorized ‘ impulses ’ ) are only lightly glossed in Alpers ’ essay , their most superficial features brought to bear on a , by contrast , highly sophisticated argument about forms of ‘ mapped ’ landscapes ( as she terms PRP ) , best exemplified by DT flat panoramic paintings of Philips Koninck . This inverted theoretical focus distorts our perspective of Dutch ( and other ) maps and relegates to DT periphery an enormously dynamic visual source in DT early modern Netherlands . PRP RB irons out – unnecessarily – DT stimulating complexities of cartographic sources and DT promising possibilities of Alpers ’ implied query : what do maps offer to scholars of Dutch visual culture ? Rather than a ‘ flat working surface ’ , a Dutch map of this period was typically dense and jagged , presenting DT viewer with multiple angles of interpretive entry , as DT essays of this issue show for other NN and genres . Rather than offering a ‘ detached or perhaps even … culturally unbiased view ’ – can such a source ever be possible ? – these profusely layered artefacts furnish critical insight into and material evidence of DT visual culture WDT Alpers aims to address . 3 Early modern maps are delightfully thick objects and fundamentally material things . PRP illustrate modes of representation and craft , and PRP encourage various points of vision and interpretation . As PRP turns out , maps are anything but ‘ flat ’ . PRP richly demonstrate , in their own way , DT ‘ picturing impulse ’ of early modern Dutch culture . This brief intervention aims not so much to argue with Alpers as to consider a part of her argument WDT was left relatively under‐scrutinized : DT workings of Dutch maps . My goal is less to analyse how these maps work – EX is a vast and expanding literature WDT does just that4 – or even how PRP work in DT context of early modern Dutch painting , but rather to explore DT qualities of cartographic design WDT might speak to DT thematics of seeing and sensing pictures , so IN PRP might contribute , in this way , to DT broader understanding of Dutch visual culture WDT this issue sets out to explore . Maps are indubitably thick : PRP gesture relentlessly toward their materiality and to DT challenge their makers face in rendering into two dimensions what begins as three – DT same challenge confronted by Dutch painters , as several of DT essays gathered here so elegantly argue . Maps are theatrical : PRP stage JJ space in a profusely embellished form – PRP rarely offer mere , austere ‘ description ’ – and PRP dramatize for their viewers ways of processing both DT lands and waters of DT NN and DT things and events WDT occur within them . And – as this might imply – maps are narrational : PRP narrate spaces , frame histories and posit polemics – much IN Baroque theatre , to be sure , yet RB IN genres of painting of DT period , both in DT Netherlands and elsewhere . To demonstrate a few of these qualities , I turn , naturally , to a map : Nicolaes Visscher 's immensely popular Novissima et Accuratissima Totius Americae Descriptio ( first edition c . 1658 ; plate 1 ) , published more or less contemporaneously with Vermeer 's Allegory of Painting ( c . 1666–68 ) . Visscher 's printed map has an impressive history , VBG backward and forward , and touching as well DT key cartographic source of Alpers ’ inquiry . 5 Its original author was DT only son of Claes Jansz . Visscher , DT well ‐regarded cartographer who engraved DT wall map depicted in DT Vermeer Allegory . DT Visscher family RB had ties by marriage to DT illustrious Hondius firm , makers of DT Mercator atlases through DT first half of DT seventeenth century – PRP were thus kinsmen of mapping aristocracy – and their atelier in Amsterdam on DT Kalverstraat placed them in DT thick of all things cartographic . DT younger Visscher followed in his father 's professional footsteps and enjoyed considerable success , especially with his map of DT Americas . DT Americae went through several editions , RB in revised forms engraved by other ( sometimes competing ) ateliers ; PRP was appropriated for geography books , both as an insert and ( in a distilled form ) as a frontispiece ; and PRP was routinely copied and pirated outright , extending its successful run well into DT eighteenth century . 6 PRP became perhaps DT single most important early modern map of DT western hemisphere and certainly CD of DT most recognized images of DT NNP NNP . Its allegorical ( lower ) cartouche , moreover , became DT all ‐but standard representation of ‘ America ’ , an iconic image WDT crossed easily into other genres and NN . Nevertheless , despite its prestigious lineage and its titular promises of ‘ novelty ’ and ‘ accuracy ’ , DT map succeeded not so much for its exacting ‘ description ’ as for other , arguably pictorial reasons : for its highly embellished and appealing presentation of DT NNP NNP . DT actual cartographic content of DT map – DT particular delineations of DT lands and seas of DT western hemisphere – was scarcely JJ . PRP derived mostly from older materials , chiefly Joan Blaeu 's 1648 map of DT NN ; DT outlines of DT continents of these two maps are nearly identical . This habit of replication was not at all uncommon in early modern Dutch cartography ( as in other graphic arts ) , especially in DT sort of lavishly ornamented charts WDT became DT mainstay of Amsterdam ateliers . Nor can DT Visscher map make great claims for geographic meticulousness : a prominent ‘ California ’ floats off DT western coast of America , an island of DT mapmakers ’ imagination ; DT Great Lakes blend into CD truly great lake , which leaks its contents into DT Atlantic ; and DT long ‐sought Northwest Passage is offered optimistically as readily accessible , an open NN flowing freely into Asia . DT map 's promise of novelty and accuracy , in other words , is rhetoric – again , a fairly common ploy in early modern mapping ( as in late modern advertising ) . No Baconian empiricism here , but rather strategies WDT relate to DT techniques of rhetoric – pervasive across myriad Renaissance fields of enquiry – and to DT crafty practices of DT workshop . What likely sold DT map , more than its less ‐than ‐meticulous ‘ description ’ of DT continents , MD have been DT staging of DT Americae and DT ample ‘ adornments ’ WDT enriched Visscher 's product : DT four‐legged staffage WDT wander DT open , ultimately uncharted spaces of DT map ( what J. B. Harley famously called its ‘ silences ’ ) ; DT ethnographic vignettes WDT explicate DT NNP NNP 's indigenes ; and , not least , DT superb cartouches WDT fill DT upper and lower divisions of DT vast Pacific Ocean , at once distilling and framing DT continents in terms of space and narrative . 7 DT charming ‘ creatures in DT map ’ – these did not VB out of style in DT Renaissance – MD have appealed to a range of consumers . 8 Two handsome stag deer saunter across DT terrain of Eastern Canada ( Nova Francia on DT map ) ; PRP MD appear to await DT hunter 's arrow just as do DT tame deer of Ben Johnson 's poetic Penshurst or any other exemplary country house . A fox gambols across DT Great Plains ( a scene likewise redolent of DT Northern European countryside ) ; and beavers , coveted lately by Dutch merchants for their valuable pelts , pose obediently just inland of DT plainly demarcated empire of Nieu [ NNP ] Nederland .9 Further afield a pair of brown bears inhabit DT open , wild west ; meanwhile , a lone anteater has South America largely to himself . DT two‐legged staffage of tropical America – DT is , DT indigenous Americans – do no hunt any exotic fauna , but CD another . Their depiction in DT interior of Brazil , naked and engrossed in brutal warfare , offers a synoptic view of DT ‘ savage ’ Indian , here imagined as uncivilized if RB unobtrusive . As for DT pair of cartouches , CD occupying DT upper left and DT other DT lower left portion of Visscher 's print , these serve as DT dual anchors of DT map , DT dominant pictorial elements and DT keys to DT artefact 's interpretation ( plate 2 and plate 3 ) . PRP RB function to stage DT map 's motifs and – crucially – to elucidate its overall message . PRP is here IN both DT theatrical and narrative impulses of Dutch mapping come through most vividly and most pictorially . Both cartouches follow designs by Nicolaes Pietersz . Berchem , a highly regarded landscape painter , as PRP turns out ( and DT only son of Pieter Claesz , a master of still ‐life painting ) , who specialized in a form of idealized Italianate scenes popular in DT period ( a subgenre of Dutch landscape WDT lay conspicuously beyond Alpers ’ scrutiny as putatively un ‐Dutch ) . 10 DT pair of map vignettes work as an ensemble – DT device of DT parasol lures DT viewer 's eye from DT vignette below to DT balancing scene above – yet PRP is DT iconic figure of America herself , who gracefully gestures to DT map 's ‘ carved ’ title , WDT lies at DT heart of DT visual programme . Berchem at once allegorized and condensed DT essential qualities of DT cartographic space . He packed PRP all in : DT alluring personification of ‘ America ’ , decked out in a dainty feathered skirt and colourful feathered headdress ; DT pearls , barely visible around her neck , demonstrating DT region 's endemic richness ; DT classic bow and arrow , just to her right , alluding to her habit of hunting ( America RB bears a stylized club ) ; DT mounds of freshly mined gold ( or perhaps silver ) piling up at her feet , alongside stacks of ingots WDT indicate DT substantial mineral wealth of DT continent ; a pair of queerly coiled snakes , which reveal DT exotic naturalia of DT NNP NNP ; and DT central parasol , which shades America 's head from DT tropical sun.11 DT sum of DT parts tells DT story of DT whole : a massively rich , vaguely exotic , not ‐quite‐tamed NNP NNP . DT upper cartouche furnishes another allegory , which introduces a different angle on America , yet CD WDT is thematically complementary . A cluster of figures surrounds and supports a free‐floating , shield ‐like device , which bears a patron 's coat of arms and DT map 's dedication ( to Cornelius Witsen , a major supporter of overseas trade and exploration , on DT original NN , yet this varies with different printings ) . 12 DT predominant figure of this cluster , a European woman hovering in DT very upper‐left corner of DT map , represents Christian Faith : relatively plainly dressed , she points didactically with CD hand to a cross WDT she holds in her other hand and positions directly above DT other figures . She glances not to DT cross , however , but to a broad ‐shouldered , sharp‐taloned , demon ‐like figure below , who tumbles out of DT sky : an allegory of diabolism , ejected by DT Christian Church . An angel opposite and above gazes , mouth agape , at this falling devil and DT wondrous turn of events , while another heavenly figure , just to DT angel 's left , announces per clarion DT plunge of diabolism and DT spread of DT gospel . Finally , an Indian – DT figure situated closest to DT American landmass who wears DT same feathered headdress as DT principal ‘ American ’ figure of DT lower cartouche , in this way linking DT two vignettes – gazes in astonishment at DT allegory of Faith , whose good works have apparently converted him . DT cartouche recounts , in short , DT Church 's labours in DT NNP NNP : its presumed successes casting out false faiths and diabolisms , and evangelizing among DT American indigenes .13 To say IN these vignettes are staged is to identify both DT drama of Faith 's triumphs in DT NNP NNP and DT several marks of theatricality WDT hold DT ensemble together . DT parasol does this formally : not only does PRP lure DT eye upward , but PRP points directly to DT upper Indian ; were he to fall from DT sky , he might pierce himself on DT parasol 's tasselled spike . DT parasol functions , further , as a clever stage prop , a showy accoutrement WDT establishes DT ostentatious tropicality of America ( DT point of DT parasol abuts DT very words ‘ Tropicus Capricorni ’ ) . In fact , bona fide parasols commonly served as props in Baroque theatre ; and a particularly famous example of this , DT engraving of Anne Bracegirdle in her popular role as ‘ DT Indian Queen ’ , alludes subtly to DT Berchem allegory of America : feathers , pearls and parasol render DT renowned Restoration actress adequately ‘ exotic ’ . 14 Theatrical motions – of hands and other limbs – RB lend DT joint cartouches a dramatic , balletic cogency : arms akimbo on either side of DT title slab , hands gesturing instructively by DT allegorical figures both above and below , and DT scissoring feet of Christian Faith and her Indian protégé alike all serve to animate DT scene . DT swirling dress of Faith , swept up by DT heavenly winds , and her billowing and entirely theatrical shawl ( since this prop MD have been utterly extraneous in DT heavens ) suggest , yet again , tricks of DT stage – and , of course , of highly painterly composition . All of these devices heighten DT drama of DT map and thereby elucidate DT meaning of America . And all of these devices might RB prompt DT question : what is DT message of DT map and DT narrative arch WDT bridges Berchem 's upper and lower cartouches ? DT bond between Faith and America harks back to a proverbial wisdom WDT circulated in late medieval and early modern Europe about DT inverse relation of ‘ god ’ and ‘ gold ’ : wherever DT latter flowed abundantly , PRP was proposed , DT former was typically scarce ( and DT reverse ) . Such a conception of America and her endemic riches ‐cum ‐heathenism justified much of Habsburg Spain 's early colonial action in DT NNP NNP – DT conquest and simultaneous conversion of DT Indians . Yet PRP RB carried an implicit moral message , which gained traction among critics of DT Habsburg Conquista , especially in Northern Europe . And here PRP need to turn to a text , CD of JJ WDT MD have helped viewers read Visscher 's map . A late sixteenth ‐century poem , which captioned DT Dutch and German editions of an engraved allegory of America , commented poignantly on this contradictory relationship between DT European god and American gold ( words WDT punned even more in DT original : god and goud in Dutch ) : Here DT wondrous mineral wealth of America fosters her own decline ; she goes from benighted idolatry to miserable slavery . DT sixteenth ‐century allegory ( engraved by Adriaen Collaert after a design by Maarten de Vos ) expresses sympathy for DT doubly abused Indians . In DT Visscher map , however , with its relatively neutral ‐looking figure of Faith , not obviously Catholic nor Protestant , and with its pan‐colonial vision of DT Americas – NNP France , NNP Netherlands , and English ‐settled Virginia are all engraved into DT space , no less than DT nomenclature of Iberian colonial possessions in South America – DT message pertains to European colonialism and European exoticism writ large . DT map spells out DT evangelical and imperial rise of DT Old NNP in DT NNP . A map , however , even while PRP MD possess plentiful text and even while PRP might be read as and with DT help of text , is certainly not identical to text – PRP is textual and pictorial , not to mention cartographical . PRP is RB material , of course , and while EX MD have been textual and iconographic foundations for such maps as Visscher 's , EX were RB unmistakable evocations of craft and materiality . DT heritage of early modern Dutch cartography goes back not so much to Ptolemy , as Alpers argues , as to DT pioneering labours of Gerard Mercator and Abraham Ortelius , who drew on DT traditions of late ‐medieval mapping – highly pictorial and allegorical products , typically emanating from DT workshops of master illuminators – and on DT NN of craft . 16 Ortelius instinctively placed geography in DT context of art : famously in relationship to history ( ‘ Historiae oculus geographia ’ ) , yet RB in DT sphere of drama . 17 His Theatrum orbis terrarrum not only summons DT language of DT stage , but RB greets its audience on its engraved title page with a recognizable proscenium ( plate 4 ) . Mercator – whose posthumously published atlas RB adapted DT symbols of theatre on its title page – sprang more directly from DT milieu of craft . His main source of income in his early professional NNS came from DT fabrication of mathematical and navigational instruments – this placed him in DT vibrant , metal ‐working ateliers of northern Europe – and , for JJ of DT early cartographic projects with which PRP associate him ( his work with Gemma Frisius and Gaspar à Myrica , for example , on their terrestrial globe ) , he served as a highly skilled engraver of brass plates . He was RB an innovator in DT production of commercial globes ; and he was a remarkable italicist , who composed , designed and printed DT first instruction book of italic script published north of DT Alps . He mastered math and craft , art and ‘ NN ’ . More to DT point , DT actual , tangible maps of Mercator and Ortelius VBP out of their way in these early NNS to emphasize their affiliation with modes of craft and material arts . Both mapmakers ’ ateliers , in producing DT first generation of ‘ craft maps ’ – this is DT geographer John Pickles ’ term for DT highly pictorial , thickly ornamented maps WDT developed in DT late sixteenth ‐century Netherlands18 – make habitual reference to DT process of their maps ’ production and to DT material arts whence PRP came . Thus does Mercator 's Orbis Terrae Compendiosa Descriptio make literal reference to its maker 's background in brass ‐work by DT depiction of an armillary sphere in DT upper centre of DT map 's design , while RB making more figurative allusions to metalwork in DT strapwork surrounding DT armillary ; in DT elaborate fretwork bearing DT JJ hemispheres ; and in DT clever metallic tooling of DT engraved frame WDT encases DT NN map ( plate 5 ) . These devices serve to emphasize DT ‘ thickness ’ of early modern cartography – its broader project of converting three ‐dimensional space into two – while RB invoking DT material arts with which Mercator ( and JJ map illuminators before him ) sought to affiliate himself . Thus , too , does Ortelius offer CD of his most celebrated cartographic images – Abrahami Patriarchae Peregrinatio et Vita ( 1590 ) , which charts DT life and journeys of DT Old Testament patriarch Abraham , DT mapmaker 's namesake – as a trompe l'oeil WDT invokes DT illustrious art of tapestry ( plate 6 ) . Meanwhile , several other graphic techniques make more subtle gestures to various other material arts : twenty ‐two circular medallion vignettes , so ‐called since PRP evoke DT bronze medallions much in fashion at DT NN , do DT heavy ‐lifting narration of Abraham 's life ; two superb cartouches display DT map 's textual apparatus and once again reference DT art of strapwork ( DT interior sample with garlands being a particularly fine example of DT genre ) ; and two decorative masks – ‘ hung ’ on a strapwork cartouche , which is ‘ fastened ’ to a cartographic tapestry – not only lend a sense of depth to this already densely materialized map , but RB allude to DT NN of theatre . DT map , in short , offers a tour de force of spatial manipulation – to VB along with its textual and pictorial narration . Some three ‐quarters of a century later , Nicolaes Visscher and Nicolaes Berchem likewise expended considerable effort in thickening their map . PRP collaboratively layered several illusions of space in DT Americae engraving . Careful hatching around DT edges of DT continents and scattered islands lends a sense of depth to DT hemisphere , a quality further enhanced by DT ‘ shadows ’ cast by DT ships at NN and DT animals on shore ( see plate 1 ) . This imparts to what otherwise might be perceived as flat geographic space DT property of density , and PRP grants DT map 's viewers an optical sense of verticality , as if PRP were observing DT continents from an elevated , almost atmospheric altitude . DT swirling figures of DT upper vignette induce a dizzying lateral movement yet further up ; PRP are now in DT skies , if not quite DT heavens , where shadow and wind still persist ( see plate 3 ) . DT curling ( upper ) cartouche , which carries DT map 's dedication on DT form of a wooden shield , RB plays with DT materiality of DT shield : a shield bears a shield , as PRP were . In DT lower vignette , space moves more horizontally . Here EX is a quality of earthiness , as opposed to DT lofty airiness above , and DT conceit WDT DT ground slopes downward along with DT figures behind DT ‘ slab ’ of cartouche who recede gently into DT horizon ( and presumably further into DT subterranean mines from where America 's gold and silver originate ) ( see plate 2 ) . And if wind animates DT upper scene , DT sun plays DT role below , casting shadows over DT figure of America , thereby RB accentuating DT tropical heat of DT land . DT parasol , DT most tangible of accessories of DT tropics and theatre alike , stylishly shields ‘ America ’ from DT elements , and in this way RB pulls DT narrative spaces together . Craft maps , a genre developed outstandingly in DT picture‐rich culture of DT early modern Netherlands , drew from DT arts of painting and engraving , and from DT fields of geography and DT material arts . Their form owed much to DT practices of ateliers : to printerly habits of delineating and ‘ describing ’ , to be sure , yet RB to modes of narrating and embellishing space , of crafting and thickening maps . Indeed , within DT intricate matrix of early modern Dutch workshops , DT makers of maps borrowed as well as loaned ; images from cartographic sources and geography books moved from printed NN ( textual as well as iconographic ) , yet RB to material arts . ‘ America ’ MD redeploy over DT coming decades from maps to forms of tapestry , ceramic ( especially porcelain , once Europe mastered its own techniques of production ) , lacquer ‐ware , cut glass , and so on , as DT image steadily gained in popularity . Visscher 's cartographic images , in other words , moved from DT two ‐dimensional space of DT map back to DT three ‐dimensional space of DT decorative arts from where Mercator and Ortelius had drawn their earlier inspiration . Both DT lineage and DT influence of ‘ craft ’ maps are rich in numerous ways . Early modern Dutch maps are anything but mere ‘ description ’ , and PRP most certainly illustrate , pace Alpers , abundant ‘ pictorial marks of [ social and political ] authority ’ . CD PRP illustrate and narrate and dramatize much more , and much WDT speaks rather productively to Alpers ’ and our concerns with Dutch visual culture . For maps such as those produced by Visscher and his contemporaries ask PRP – just as other prints and paintings do – to VB about space and its representation . Dutch maps use graphic forms and pictorial devices to stage space and to present DT drama of space from multiple angles and perspectives . Visscher 's map , complemented by Berchem 's vignettes , displays DT drama of European expansion from up high and down low , from DT fauna‐rich interiors of DT American continents to DT ship ‐peppered seas WDT surround them . PRP invokes DT tricks of theatre – rhetoric and gesture , evocation and insinuation , props and propaganda – to narrate space , in this case DT spaces of European conquest , colonialism and empire . And PRP narrates DT space in assorted ways , just as history narrates and as other textual and pictorial genres narrate : to be DT eye of history is not necessarily to be wholly mute ( or purely descriptive ) . PRP does all this , again as other visual sources do , as a means to entice its viewers . DT Americae beckon in myriad ways : Berchem 's figure of ‘ America ’ seduces its viewer with her opulent pearls and exotic feathers , tactile prompts of supreme allure ; Visscher 's sheet map invokes multiple registers of materiality , encouraging an intense sense of touch , depth and space ; and DT Americae , of course , arouse wide ‐ranging colonial desires , which surely reached across to several early modern European aspirants of imperial worlds . Early modern Dutch maps , in these JJ ways , surely exhibit DT shared impulses of painting and cartography , yet this does not so much demonstrate a flattened mapping impulse in Dutch art as PRP reveals DT rich , thick , pictorial impulses in Dutch maps ."

EX are so JJ interesting facts about this Pyramid WDT PRP baffles archaeologists , NNS , astronomers and tourists . Here are DT facts : 01 . DT pyramid is estimated to have around 2,300,000 stone blocks WDT weigh from 2 to 30 tons each and EX are even some blocks WDT weigh over 50 tons . 02 . DT Pyramid of Menkaure , DT Pyramid of Khafre and DT Great Pyramid of Khufu are precisely aligned with DT Constellation of Orion . 03 . DT base of DT pyramid covers 55,000 m2 ( 592,000 ft 2 ) with each side greater than 20,000 m2 ( 218,000 ft2 ) in area . 04 . DT interior temperature is constant and equals DT average temperature of DT NN , 20 Degrees Celsius ( 68 Degrees Fahrenheit ) . 05 . DT outer mantle was composed of 144,000 casing stones , all of them highly polished and flat to an accuracy of 1/100th of an inch , about 100 inches thick and weighing approx . 15 tons each . 06 . DT cornerstone foundations of DT pyramid have ball and socket construction capable of dealing with heat expansion and earthquakes . 07 . DT mortar used is of an unknown origin ( Yes , no explanation given ) . PRP has been analyzed and its chemical composition is known but PRP ca n’t be reproduced . PRP is stronger than DT stone and still holding up today . 08 . PRP was originally covered with casing stones ( made of highly polished limestone ) . These casing stones reflected DT sun ’s light and made DT pyramid shine IN a jewel . PRP are no longer present being used by Arabs to build mosques after an earthquake in DT 14th century loosened JJ of them . PRP has been calculated IN DT original pyramid with its casing stones MD act IN gigantic mirrors and reflect light so powerful IN PRP MD be visible from DT moon as a shining star on NN . Appropriately , DT ancient Egyptians called DT Great Pyramid “ Ikhet ” , meaning DT “ Glorious Light ” . How these blocks were transported and assembled into DT pyramid is still a mystery . – http://www.gizapyramid.com/general.htm 09 . Aligned True North : DT Great Pyramid is DT most accurately aligned structure in existence and faces true north with only 3/60th of a degree of error . DT position of DT North Pole moves over NN and DT pyramid was exactly aligned at CD NN . 10 . Center of Land Mass : DT Great Pyramid is located at DT center of DT land mass of DT NN . DT east / west parallel WDT crosses DT most land and DT north / south meridian WDT crosses DT most land intersect in two places on DT NN , CD in DT ocean and DT other at DT Great Pyramid . 11 . DT four faces of DT pyramid are slightly concave , DT only pyramid to have been built this way . 12 . DT centers of DT four sides are indented with an extraordinary degree of precision forming DT only 8 sided pyramid , this effect is not visible from DT ground or from a distance but only from DT air , and then only under DT proper lighting conditions . This phenomenon is only detectable from DT air at dawn and sunset on DT spring and autumn equinoxes , when DT sun casts shadows on DT pyramid . 13 . DT granite coffer in DT “ King ’s Chamber ” is too big to fit through DT passages and so PRP must have been put in place during construction . 14 . DT coffer was made out of a block of solid granite . This MD have required bronze saws 8 - 9 ft. long set with teeth of sapphires . Hollowing out of DT interior MD require tubular drills of DT same material applied with a tremendous vertical force . 15 . Microscopic analysis of DT coffer reveals IN PRP was made with a fixed point drill WDT used hard jewel bits and a drilling force of 2 tons . Related : DT Real Builders of DT Pyramids 16 . DT Great Pyramid had a swivel door entrance at CD NN . Swivel doors were found in only two other pyramids : Khufu ’s father and grandfather , Sneferu and Huni , respectively . 17 . PRP is reported IN when DT pyramid was first broken into IN DT swivel door , weighing some 20 tons , was so well balanced IN PRP MD be opened by pushing out from DT inside with only minimal force , but when closed , was so perfect a fit WDT PRP MD scarcely be detected and EX was not enough crack or crevice around DT edges to gain a grasp from DT outside . 18 . With DT mantle in place , DT Great Pyramid MD be seen from DT mountains in Israel and probably DT moon as well . CD . DT weight of DT pyramid is estimated at 5,955,000 tons . Multiplied by 10^8 gives a reasonable estimate of DT NN ’s mass . 20 . DT Descending Passage pointed to DT pole star Alpha Draconis , circa 2170 - 2144 BCE . This was DT North Star at DT point in NN . No other star has aligned with DT passage since then . 21 . DT southern shaft in DT King ’s Chamber pointed to DT star Al Nitak ( Zeta Orionis ) in DT constellation Orion , circa 2450 BCE DT Orion constellation was associated with DT Egyptian god Osiris . No other star aligned with this shaft during DT NN in history . 22 . Sun ’s Radius : Twice DT perimeter of DT bottom of DT granite coffer times 10^8 is DT sun ’s mean radius . [ 270.45378502 Pyramid Inches* 10^8 = 427,316 miles ] 23 . DT curvature designed into DT faces of DT pyramid exactly matches DT radius of DT NN . 24 . Khufu ’s pyramid , known as DT great pyramid of Giza , is DT oldest and largest , rising at 481 feet ( 146 meters ) . Archaeologists say PRP was DT tallest structure in DT NN for about 3 , 800 NNS . 25 . DT relationship between Pi ( p ) and Phi ( F ) is expressed in DT fundamental proportions of DT Great Pyramid .

A paradigm shift is a fundamental NN in approach or underlining assumptions . For example , when Pythagoras proposed IN DT NNP was round instead of flat , DT foundation of NN and NNS ’s understanding of DT NN was completely changed . Similarly , when DT Industrial Revolution took place EX was a complete shift in manufacturing , lifestyle , and economics . A paradigm shift can literally shake a society to its core , taking PRP off its current path and putting PRP on a brand JJ NN . Though PRP might appear DT opposite in DT corporate controlled mainstream NN , PRP appears IN DT entire NN is in DT very early stages of a paradigm shift . These shifts take place in JJ of DT worlds most basic elements and redefine how life functions . Here are 8 signs DT NN is undergoing a paradigm shift : 1. DT Power of DT Internet and DT Age of Information DT Internet is arguably DT greatest invention in DT history of man . Never in our known history has man had access to such a broad range of diverse information from all over DT NN at DT tips of his fingers . JJ forget IN DT Internet has only really been commercialized in DT west since DT early 1990 ’s and its spread across DT NN has n’t even come close to peaking yet . DT Internet is undoubtedly giving rise to DT Age of Information as NNS become more awake to what ’s really VBG on in DT NN . A multitude of information is now accessible if PRP knows where to look . NNS can now learn JJ skills or hear different versions of DT truth in mere minutes . DT Internet is not only giving rise to an open access of information , but communication is almost instantaneous all over DT NN . PRP is paramount IN DT Internet remain an open decentralized system in which everyone can freely add and operate if this paradigm shift is to continue . PRP feeds almost all other shifts . 2. DT Ascent Of DT Independent Non-Corporate Online NN Thanks solely to DT Internet , DT rise in independent journalism has taken off . Alternative NN has become an increasingly popular choice for those wishing to stay truly informed , especially younger generations . NNS are continually switching off cable NN ( cable TV all together ) , and instead resorting to online sources . While mainstream NN is still DT number CD source of current NN events for DT masses , DT tide is slowly changing as NNS are awakening to DT fact IN corporate sponsored NN is mostly propaganda and half - truths . War is becoming much harder to justify as independent journalists have shined DT light on what DT powers WDT be never wanted anyone to see . A prime example is DT conflict in Syria in which DT establishment , despite DT lack of popular support , so desperately wanted to start a war IN when DT rebels PRP were funding used chemical weapons , PRP was then blamed on DT Assad NN to protect their investment and design . Thanks to independent journalists , a war has so far been averted since PRP was revealed IN DT U.S. was in bed with DT rebel groups and PRP was DT rebels who used DT chemical weapons . This JJ faction of journalism will give peace a legitimate chance as all dirty laundry is now being aired and corrupt alliances exposed . This in turn has allowed JJ NNS to deprogram from DT countless NN PRP have taken in over DT NNS and see DT NN through a clearer lens in which DT truth is more evident . Though PRP will never be broadcast on mainstream NN , DT real threat of a U.S. dollar collapse as DT NN reserve currency is very real . DT paradigm of central bank controlled economies WDT can issue credit and zero percent interest rates through nearly unlimited printing of money backed by nothing is an illusion WDT is beginning to break down . PRP ’s not just DT U.S. dollar WDT ’s under threat , but JJ other central currencies such as DT Euro and Yen . Massive equity bubbles are being blown up by this cheap credit along with massive debt WDT will be nearly impossible to pay back with DT current economies in which only DT very elite benefit . JJ NNS are waking up to DT fact IN , IN all other bubbles , these bubbles will burst and PRP are beginning to break away from DT dollar . Examples include DT buildup of a JJ central bank in DT emerging economy of DT BRICS group , DT countless NNS passing trade agreements in which bypassing DT U.S. dollar ( including agreements in oil ) , and DT persistent selling of treasury stocks by DT Chinese NN who quite often are DT last resort buyer of U.S. debt . Not only has EX been a shift in DT pecking order of fiat paper currencies , but decentralized crypto-currencies IN Bitcoin are threatening DT very system of fiat money and DT centralized control a select few elite have on DT system through central banks . This MD shift power worldwide . 4. DT Rise of DT Peer - to - Peer Economy A Peer - to - Peer ( P20 ) Economy is a de-centralized model whereby two individuals interact to buy or sell goods and services directly with each other , without intermediation by a third - party , or without DT use of a company or business . PRP see this being used by companies IN Air BnB , Uber , Craigslist , Sidecar , and Dogvacay among others . Often referred to as a sharing economy , EX is no centralized control of power , allowing NNS to more directly profit from their goods / services rather than pay unnecessary middlemen along DT way . This is a trend WDT is sure to grow as technology makes PRP easier for NNS to make PRP on their own and allows for NNS to own their means of production and finished goods , instead of just being paid in DT production process . DT peer - to - peer economy is RB possible through DT abundance of goods already out RB , allowing for goods to be shared and recycled rather than thrown away and reproduced . Not only is DT peer - to - peer economy growing , but JJ young NNS are ditching DT career 9 - 5 jobs and branching off into independent careers or job hopping . DT top down business model in economics has now found a legitimate system in which a decentralized bottom up approach gives DT power back to DT NNS . DT shift towards renewable NN is a forgone conclusion as renewable NN is DT way of DT future . In fact , DT shift looks to be happening faster than NNS realize . According to DT NNP NNP Initiative , “ Numerous scenarios projected levels of renewable NN for 2020 WDT already were surpassed by 2010 . ” DT IEA VBZ IN , “ In 2012 , DT NN relied on renewable sources for around 13.2 % of its total primary NN supply , and in 2013 renewables accounted for almost 22 % of JJ electricity generation . ” With increased technological capabilities along with ever - growing concern over DT NN of DT environment , DT NN is beginning to not only shift towards renewables , but DT power over NN supplies and grids is decentralizing . For example , home solar panels or DT JJ Tesla Powerwall , MD enable NNS to access their own NN directly from DT sun without VBG through middlemen . Another example is a local city IN Burlington , VT being DT first city in DT U.S. to use 100 % renewable NN ; even whole NNS IN Paraguay , Iceland and Norway being 100 % renewable . Cheap localized NN is on DT horizon along with DT very real possibility Nikola Teslaonce envisioned , which is a NN of free NN . DT reemergence of organic food is not only on DT rise , but DT use of farmers markets and locally grown food is on DT rise as well . According to DT Non GMO project , “ In more than 60 NNS around DT NN , including Australia , Japan , and all of DT NNS in DT European Union , EX are significant restrictions or outright bans on DT production and sale of GMOs . ” DT rise is so strong IN according to DT Organic Trade Association , “ Supply shortages [ of organics ] are CD of DT greatest challenges facing DT industry today . Despite continued growth in production , handlers are not able to keep up with demand . ” Thanks in large part to DT Internet and non-corporate sponsored research , NNS are beginning to understand DT importance behind knowing exactly what ’s in DT food CD consumes and how PRP directly correlates to NN . This has put mounting pressure on food businesses to adapt . DT signs are already evident as Chipotle sees their profits increase while operating completely Non-GMO , while sales giants such as McDonalds see profits continue to decrease amidst NN concerns over their food . JJ are beginning to truly care what goes into their body and DT rise of localized non-organic food in this country is a direct result of this NN - conscious shift . 7. DT Understanding Of a NN of Abundance As Gandhi famously VBD , “ DT NN has enough for every man ’s needs , but not for every man ’s greed . ” NNS are finally awaking to DT fact IN EX is enough to VB around , just not with DT current systems in place . No NN is saying EX is enough for everyone to live at current western consumption rates , however with adoption of renewable NN , JJ forms of decentralized NN and economics , and DT increase in DT usage of technological capabilities , EX is more than enough for everyone in DT NN to live happily . For example , DT NN produces enough food for 10 billion NNS , yet JJ VBP starving as a result of faulty systems of distribution . Another example is NN ; EX is more than enough NN on DT NN , but PRP ’s DT JJ systems WDT VBP in DT way of technology . DT notion of scarcity has long haunted DT systems of NN and economics , but now a JJ paradigm of abundance is beginning to take root in DT minds of NNS . DT Venus project is a prime example of an alternative resource based economy in which sustainability and resource supply are taken into account . A NN of abundance with zero emission is no longer just a pipe dream , but MD very well become a reality as NNS VBP in terms of abundance . Finally a consciousness shift is underway in which NNS are starting to see themselves as more than just individual NNS operating in an isolated bubble , but instead as a connected piece in DT collective consciousness of NN NNP . DT Internet , along with DT increased capacity for travel , has allowed NNS from all over DT NN to connect . So JJ parts of DT JJ society have become interconnected and NNS are beginning to take notice of not only their own country , but NNS abroad . JJ are beginning to realize IN CD group of NNS suffering means everyone is suffering . This interconnection to everything has given rise to practices such as meditation , yoga , and travel , as well as DT continued JJ acceptance towards mind altering organic substances IN marijuana and mushrooms . NNS are beginning to emotionally connect to life all over DT NN and not just their immediate home and surroundings . This JJ reality is showing NNS IN EX is more to life than money , as connection to all living things is equally , if not more , valuable . As PRP can see , DT NN is very much in DT early stages of a shift in consciousness and design . These shifts are leading to a growing decentralization movement in which DT power controls of society are taken from DT few and given to DT JJ . Obviously , EX is a very strong force at play WDT is fighting against this paradigm shift . This force is fighting for centralization of power in almost all facets of life . EX can be no doubt of DT presence of this resistance when PRP examines DT ever - increasing wealth and power gap WDT is out of control in this country . DT actions taken by these elite organizations are getting more radical and desperate by DT day . With all DT being VBN , DT JJ paradigm shift has CD advantage WDT I believe will be DT game changer , and DT ’s DT will of DT NNS . This is not just DT NNS of a a single country , but internationally , as VBN JJ movements such as Occupy Wall street , DT Arab Spring , and March Against Monsanto are happening simultaneously all over DT NN around central causes . So wake - up and participate , for PRP are in DT early stages of a revolutionary paradigm shift in DT consciousness of DT masses WDT can truly VB society for DT better . An avid free - thinker , Tim has set out on a mission in search of DT truth in whatever form PRP MD come . Ever since his awakening several NNS ago , his passion for knowledge and justice has led him on a journey into deep research , cultural travel , and complete expansion of DT mind . Tim feels as if DT information freely flowing into DT hands of DT NN , due to DT dawn of DT Internet , cannot be stopped at this point , so he has made PRP his goal to help facilitate and breakdown this complex stream of information , so IN others can accelerate their own awakening and be part of DT inevitable NN happening in society .

If ye be reproached for DT name of Christ , happy are ye ; for DT spirit of glory and of God resteth upon PRP : on their part he is evil spoken of , but on your part he is glorified . But let none of PRP suffer as a murderer , or as a thief , or as an evildoer , or as a busybody in other men 's matters . Yet if any man suffer as a Christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glorify God on this behalf . For DT NN is come DT judgment must begin at DT house of God : and if PRP first begin at PRP , what shall DT end be of them WDT obey not DT gospel of God ? More and more , as I grow older , I am rejoicing and thanking and praising God for His blessings in my life . Most of all , I thank God for DT gift of His dear Son , Jesus Christ . John 3:16 , “ For God so loved DT NN , IN he gave his only begotten Son , IN whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life . ” During my 52 NNS of life , I have been through much suffering , pain of soul , frustration , loneliness , NN afflictions , loss and betrayal ; yet I am so happy to be a child of God . I thank God for DT roof over my head , even though PRP is not mine . I thank God for DT vehicle WDT I drive , even though PRP is worn and has a tire VBG flat WDT I need to VB fixed . I thank God for my body , even though I have incurable stenosis and radiculopathy from a neck injury which afflicts me horribly with chronic pain 24 / 7 . I thank God for my eyes , even though I am near - sighted and cannot see well at a distance . I do not VB being divorced and alone , but I thank God IN I was n't DT NN who filed for divorce , and I thank God for my family . I thank God for my imperfect parents , imperfect pastor , imperfect childhood , imperfect life , imperfect free country WDT I am blessed to live in . Thank PRP Lord for all your blessings on me ! I rejoice in knowing IN my name is written in Heaven , in DT Lamb 's Book of Life . I thank God IN He forgave me for all my sins at age 13 , when I was born - again , which gives me DT example , power and motivation to forgive others who have hurt me . I have forgiven everyone in my life . Ephesians 4:31 - 32 , “ Let all bitterness , and wrath , and anger , and clamour , and evil speaking , be put away from PRP , with all malice : And be ye kind CD to another , tenderhearted , forgiving CD another , even as God for Christ 's sake hath forgiven PRP . ” PRP does n't matter if others hate me , hurt me , or mistreat me , PRP are accountable to God for their actions , not me . I choose to love everyone with God 's unconditional love . I receive a lot of e-mails from NNS struggling with sin , suffering from depression , angry at God , confused and hurting in their body and soul . I love helping all of them . For those of PRP who VBP me better than others , I love writing lengthy e-mails , pouring out my heart to help NNS . I am sure I even annoy some of my web visitors , writing a book back to them . Please pardon me ! A lot of DT stems from my loneliness as a single man . I love when NNS ask me questions , and I have an answer in DT Lord to help them for Christ . PRP is my privilege . I pray for all my web visitors regularly and do love everyone with all my heart . I wish I MD only do so much more to help NNS . I do what I can for God , giving Him all DT credit , praise and glory . If EX is anything good in me , PRP is DT precious Lord Jesus Christ ! Psalms 147:7 , “ Sing unto DT LORD with thanksgiving ; unto our God . ” I bought a nice 21 string harp last NN , but have n't spent much NN with PRP . I have always loved playing stringed instruments . Lately ( in recent months ) I have kept busy working on my website ministry , and I 've been emotionally down about life in general , so I have n't felt much IN playing my music . I VBP through seasons of depression , and have learned IN this is normal for me as a Christian . DT Bible tells PRP how to handle depression in James 5:13 , “ Is any among PRP afflicted ? let him pray . Is any merry ? let him sing psalms . ” When I am sad and down about life , I bunker into DT Word of God , work hard on my ministry , focus on soulwinning , and pray my way through DT storm , trusting my beautiful all - knowing , all - powerful and all - loving God to see me through , NN after NN . Lamentations 3:26 , “ PRP is good IN a man should both hope and quietly wait for DT salvation of DT LORD . ” Is n't DT a precious Bible verse ! Lamentations 3:26 , “ PRP is good IN a man should both hope and quietly wait for DT salvation of DT LORD . ” EX is nothing JJ under DT sun . Just as today , PRP is human nature to be selfish . God had wonderfully blessed DT Hebrews , but PRP took PRP all for granted and did n't appreciate what God had done for them . Moses warned DT NNS to beware of forgetting about God in lieu of all His tremendous blessings upon them . God had miraculously parted DT Red NNP right in front of them , so IN PRP even walked across on dry ground ! Yet DT first thing PRP did when PRP got to DT other side is COMPLAIN IN PRP had no NN . This is unbelievable , read PRP for yourself ... Exodus 15:19 and 22 and 24 , “ For DT horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into DT NN , and DT LORD brought again DT waters of DT NN upon them ; but DT NNS of Israel went on dry land in DT midst of DT NN . ... So Moses brought Israel from DT Red NNP , and PRP went out into DT wilderness of Shur ; and PRP went three days in DT wilderness , and found no NN . ... And DT NNS murmured against Moses , saying , What shall PRP drink ? ” I VBP disgusted just from reading DT . Those Hebrew ingrates — who had just witnessed God deliver them from Pharaoh 's army , walking across DT Red NNP floor on dry ground , then watching Pharaoh 's army ( men and horses alike ) all drown when DT waters returned upon them — started complaining just three days later in DT Wilderness WDT PRP had no NN , failing to have faith in DT power and love of their great omnipotent God . PRP is incredibly amazing to me . Moreover , DT Jews were warned again and again by Moses DT prophet , to stop their complaining , lest PRP destroy them , but PRP did n't listen . After complaining for DT TENTH NN , God had finally had enough and banned them from ever entering into DT Promised Land . God hates DT sin of complaining ! HE HATES PRP !!! Pastor Jack Hyles preaches a powerful sermon on this very topic about complaining in a sermon titled : “ DT HOTTEST HELL OF ALL ! ” NNS ( whether PRP be fellow Christians , preachers , family , acquaintances or strangers ) are always VBG to hurt our feelings . PRP will be inconsiderate , disappoint , let PRP down , gossip about PRP , judge PRP and make PRP sad if I focus on NNS — so I live above DT clouds where Jesus lives ! America has forgotten DT God of DT Bible . Deuteronomy 6:12 , “ Then beware lest thou forget DT LORD , which brought thee forth out of DT land of Egypt , from DT house of bondage . ” So often in life , NNS receive good at DT hand of God , but return nothing in DT way of gratitude . In DT Old Testament , PRP learn about a godly man named Job , who made a remarkable statement to his wife when she suggested IN he curse God and die . Job 2:10 , “ But he VBD unto her , Thou speakest as CD of DT foolish women speaketh . What ? shall PRP receive good at DT hand of God , and shall PRP not receive evil ? In all this did not Job sin with his lips . ” Oh IN PRP MD all adopt DT godly attitude of Job , who understood ( as our text passage from 1st Peter shows ) IN life includes good and bad . I choose to praise God for DT good in my life , and blame DT Devil for DT bad . PRP is not God 's fault IN I have made some stupid and unwise decisions in my life . Blessed be DT name of DT Lord , for He is faithful , fair and good to all ! Psalms 145:9 , “ DT LORD is good to all : and his tender mercies are over all his works . ” DT heathen NN is always placing God on trial , but PRP are DT ones who refuse to obey His inspired Words in DT Holy Bible . Job 9:3 , “ If he [ man ] will contend with him [ God ] , he can not answer him CD of a thousand . ” No NN can ever blame God ( Romans 1:20 ) , for He is faithful . 2nd Timothy 2:13 , “ If PRP believe not , yet he abideth faithful : he can not deny himself . ” As Ron Hamilton ( Patch DT Pirate ) says , every Christian should have : “ DT GRATITUDE ATTITUDE ! ” Kindly , PRP are getting what PRP deserve as a foolish nation for forsaking DT God of DT Holy Bible . What can PRP expect from NNS who have grown up void of DT knowledge of God ? I read an article today about two 10 NN old looking boys who are guilty of a carjacking . To add insult to injury , Freemasons ( who control DT NNP NNPS ) have introduced DT blatant lies of Evolution in all JJ schools to intentionally lead impressionable NNS away from God , misleading them to VB IN PRP came from a Big Bang , stardust and from DT same biological source as gorillas . What can PRP expect from such abused NNS ? How can PRP expect NNS deprived of a God-centered education to exemplify God - JJ behavior ? God is love ! To deliberately withhold a God-centered education from a child , and substitute PRP with a fraudulent system of lies WDT reduce humanity to DT level of animals , is a cruel form of child abuse ! DT whole scam of DT rights of “ atheists ” not to have to hear DT teachings of DT Bible in JJ schools has destroyed DT fiber of our society ! I do n't generally follow DT NN because PRP is so depressing , but I have been doing a lot of research for my ministry and reading through crime NN lately . I did n't realize how bad things have become in American society . This is DT obvious horrifying consequence of removing and banning DT inspired Word of God from NNS 's daily lives in JJ school classrooms since 1963 . DT Holy Bible has Always Been DT Answer ! PRP cannot deny DT to DT same degree WDT our country has abandoned DT Word of God , to DT same degree society is VBG to DT Devil ! I have RB been watching DT Forensic Files , using amazing NN to solve horrifying crimes . DT evildoer culprits are sometimes police officers , fire investigates , pastors and churchgoers . PRP is unbelievable what human beings are capable of ! Truly DT human race is depraved , just as DT Holy Bible says . Romans 3:10 - 11 , “ As PRP is written , EX is none righteous , no , not CD : EX is none IN understandeth , EX is none WDT seeketh after God . ” DT city of Chicago is CD of DT most dangerous places on NN to live . DT following article is just from CD weekend ... 7 Killed , 46 Wounded In Weekend Shootings ; ‘ PRP ’s Destroying DT Fiber Of Our Communities ’ CHICAGO ( CBS ) — Dozens of NNS were shot in Chicago over DT weekend , including two mass shootings in less than three hours on Sunday . In all , seven NNS were killed and 46 others were wounded in shootings since Friday evening . More than a dozen NNS were wounded , CD of them fatally , in a pair of mass shootings in DT Lawndale neighborhood early Sunday . DT first shooting happened around 1:20 a.m. near Roosevelt and Francisco in Douglas Park . Police VBD a group of NNS was standing in DT park , when someone opened fire from a black Chevrolet Camaro . Seven NNS were wounded : • A 21 - NN - old man shot in DT groin was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in critical condition ; • A 25 - NN - old woman shot in DT arm and leg was taken to Mount Sinai , where she was stabilized ; • A 20 - NN - old man shot in DT right side was taken to Stroger Hospital , where he was stabilized ; • A CD - NN - old woman shot in DT right leg was taken to Stroger , where she was stabilized ; • A 22 - NN - old woman was taken to Mount Sinai , where she was stabilized ; • A 21 - NN - old man shot in DT left leg was taken to Mount Sinai , where he was stabilized ; • A 23 - NN - old man shot in DT chest and hand took himself to Mount Sinai , where he was stabilized . Less than three hours later , eight NNS were shot in Lawndale , near 18th and Kildare around 3:45 a.m. , when unknown s hooters opened fire on a large group of NNS at a block party . CD man , 33 - NN - old Demetrius Flowers , was killed , and seven other NNS were wounded : • A 35 - NN - old man shot in DT forehead was taken to Mount Sinai , where he was stabilized ; • A 28 - NN - old man shot in DT hip was taken to Mount Sinai , where he was stabilized ; • A 27 - NN - old man shot in DT foot was taken to Mount Sinai , where he was stabilized ; • A 28 - NN - old man shot in DT leg Mount Sinai , where he was treated and released ; • A 14 - NN - old boy was shot in DT thigh , and was taken to Stroger , where he was stabilized ; • A 21 - NN - old woman suffered a graze wound to DT thumb , and was treated and released at St. Margaret Hospital ; • A CD - NN - old woman was shot in DT head , and was taken to Stroger , where she was treated and released . Flowers ’ father , VBD PRP ’s DT second son he ’s lost to violence . “ Please stop . PRP ’s killing our families , PRP ’s destroying DT fiber of our communities . PRP have to stop this senseless killing , because if PRP do n’t , EX ’s nothing VBG to be left . EX ’s nothing VBG to be left , ” Keith Flowers VBD . CD young man unfortunately murdered over DT weekend in Chicago , was 33 NN old Demetrius Flowers . His father , Keith Flowers , made DT following JJ statement : I am not trying to be unkind , God knows my heart , but this father is preaching to DT choir . Gang thugs do n't care ! Keith is making his statement to law - abiding citizens . I noticed in DT preceding NN story IN 90 % of DT NNS shot were very young , close to 20 NNS old . DT speaks volumes ! Our youth are infested with evil today , because PRP have been deprived of God 's Word in ungodly schools . Luciferians are behind DT destruction of America ! All high - level Freemasons worship Lucifer , DT 99 % lower initiates are woefully naive . DT same is true of DT CIA , U.S. NN , Mormonism and other subversive and subverted groups . I am very sorry for Mr. Flowers ' loss in DT death of his son , and I am not belittling him in any way , God forbid . I am simply pointing out IN PRP is not VBG to VB anything to make statements about how NNS need to stop shooting each other . NNS need DT Word of God ! If PRP do n't allow thoughts of greed to dwell in your mind , then those thoughts cannot fester . No NN suddenly goes out and purchases a life insurance policy on their spouse , and then plots to murder them in a clever way to make PRP look IN an accident . Long before such wickedness came into DT person 's mind , EX was already a heart of greed and ungodliness . DT major underlying personal theme WDT I take away from DT whole Forensic Files series is DT following passage of Scripture from DT Holy Bible ... DT is DT great truth WDT needs to be engrained into DT minds of NNS , every single day of their school NNS . If I had my way , every child MD recite this passage of Scripture along with their teacher every day , at DT beginning of each class , so IN PRP MD be so engrained in their soul , IN PRP MD be a permanent part of their soul for DT rest of their life . NNS today do n't love God . Their parents who grew up in America 's Godless JJ school system , do n't love God . Their grandparents , who grew up in America 's ungodly school system after 1963 , do n't love God . Anyone in DT NNP NNPS today under DT age of 74 , did n't hear DT inspired Word of God read in a JJ school . DT is why crime is epidemic today across DT NNP NNPS , and PRP can be truthfully VBN of our culture : I am VBG to preach DT truth until I can no longer do so — DT KING JAMES BIBLE IS DT ANSWER !!!!!!! Everyone who is guilty of hurting another human being , to provide DT heinous crime to make another episode of Forensic Files , failed to heed DT Bible 's command to LOVE GOD and LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR ! DT two greatest commandments in DT Word of God are to LOVE GOD , and LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOUR . Do n't ever forget DT truth and PRP wo n't VB astray ! As Brother Lester Roloff ( 1914 - 1982 ) VBD — these two commandments are really just CD — TO LOVE ! If PRP fall in love with our Maker , and allow God to love PRP , and allow God to love our fellow man through PRP , then PRP will never intentionally harm another human being . Amen ! I sure hope somebody is listening . Every Christian believer needs to be on - guard against sin continually , because anyone is capable of committing DT worst sins under DT right circumstances . DT is what I mean by my article title : “ Love , Forgive , Help , Work And Pray . ” No NN is above sin ! NO CD ! DT Bible admonishes PRP to take heed if PRP are misled to VB PRP are doing okay , because PRP MD commit an unthinkable crime just IN DT criminals PRP read about . Every criminal at CD NN was a law - abiding citizen ! Proverbs 4:23 , “ Keep thy heart with all diligence ; for out of PRP are DT issues of life . ” DT Bible verse means to deal with DT small sinful thoughts in your mind , before PRP grow into evil behavior ! I VBP to VB right , do right , and live right , to please God and stay out of trouble . I VBP to : “ Love , Forgive , Help , Work And Pray . ” If PRP maintain DT godly attitude — of always loving others , and forgiving everyone , and helping everyone , and working honestly to stay busy , and praying for God 's power and protection from evil — PRP will joyously prosper in DT Christian life . EX is no joy IN knowing PRP are right with God and man . I VBP to live in such a way IN no NN can justly accuse me of doing evil . ... Quite often , I have web visitors confide in me IN PRP are struggling with DT sins of lust , hatred , pornography , pride , rebellion , et cetera . I always try to help them in a spirit of meekness . Galatians 6:1 , “ Brethren , if a man be overtaken in a fault , ye which are spiritual , restore such an NN in DT spirit of meekness ; considering thyself , lest thou RB be tempted . ” DT Bible teaches PRP in 2nd Corinthians 10:5 , “ Casting down imaginations , and every high thing WDT exalteth itself against DT knowledge of God , and bringing into captivity every thought to DT obedience of Christ . ” Here PRP learn how to live right ! When a sinful thought enters into our mind , PRP are supposed to CAST DOWN DT THOUGHT with DT inspired Word of God ( i.e. , DT King James Bible ) . By doing DT , PRP prevent DT Devil from filling your heart to do evil . I refuse to have a garbage pail for a mind . Anyone can choose to live right ! In DT Old Testament , Job was a godly man who purposed in his heart to VB and live right . Job 31:1 , “ I made a covenant with mine eyes ; why then should I VB upon a maid ? ” I receive e-mails from young men who are struggling with lust and pornography . DT is a very dangerous vice ! DT way to handle PRP is to take control of your thought - life and abstain from fleshly lusts . 1st Peter 2:11 , “ Dearly beloved , I beseech PRP as strangers and pilgrims , abstain from fleshly lusts , which war against DT soul . ” DT Bible commands men to abstain from DT lusts of DT flesh . To look at filthy images is a CHOICE ! Until PRP start making DT right choices , PRP 'll never gain victory over any sin . Each NN PRP make DT wrong sinful choice , PRP makes PRP a little easier to make another sinful choice , until PRP turn evil , and eventually PRP 'll be DT next episode of Forensic Files ! Behind every tragedy in human character is a slow process of wicked thinking ! Christians Are Pilgrims Not Settlers On NNP PRP is important for every believer to embrace DT mindset WDT this temporary NN is not our home . Do n't VB too comfortable down here . Brother Lester Roloff ( 1914 - 1982 ) preached a wonderful sermon titled : “ Do n't VB Adjusted , ” in which sermon he makes DT truthful statement : “ PRP LOSE OUT WHEN PRP VBP ADJUSTED DOWN HERE ! ” I hate this wicked NN ! I am so sick and tired of DT sin , DT filth , and DT ungodly transgendered homosexual agenda WDT is as a NN upon society today , sick of PRP all !!! Even so , come , Lord Jesus !!! Heaven is our home where PRP will ultimately settle ( John 14:1 - 3 ) . DT heathen NN places all emphasis on this earthly life , living for DT moment with no thought of facing DT Eternal God someday . As believers , PRP are commanded to — “ Set your affection on things above , not on things on DT NN . For ye are dead , and your life is hid with Christ in God ” ( Colossians 3:2-3 ) . Oh , how Christians fail to follow DT Lord 's instruction in DT Scriptures ! When believers fret and worry and complain and focus on making money , “ PRP are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruit to perfection ” ( Luke 8:14 ) . Carnal believers are n't soulwinners ! All PRP hear about nowadays is IN everyone should accept and respect DT rights of homosexuals . DT heart of DT matter is God . What does God VB ? What does God say in His Holy Word ? PRP 've got DT righteous speaking out against DT evils of homosexuality , as DT Bible tells PRP to do . Ephesians 5:10 - 12 , “ Proving what is acceptable unto DT Lord . And have no fellowship with DT unfruitful works of darkness , but rather reprove them . For PRP is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret . ” A man sodomizing another man 's anus is a work of darkness ! I am grossed out and sickened when I hear pastors of churches legitimizing DT LGBTQ community , such as did Southern Baptist Convention NN J.D. Greear . Proverbs 29:27 , “ An unjust man is an abomination to DT just : and he WDT is upright in DT way is abomination to DT wicked . ” Kindly , I heard Tim Cook , DT present CEO of Apple computer say publicly : “ Being gay is God 's greatest gift to me . ” God calls Tim Cook a liar ! Proverbs 28:9 , “ He WDT turneth away his ear from hearing DT law , even his prayer shall be abomination . ” Leviticus 20:13 , “ If a man RB lie with mankind , as he lieth with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination : PRP shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them . ” PRP are living in extremely wicked times , in which ungodly reprobates are elevating their own ungodly human lusts over DT inspired Words of God . DT is so wrong ! Judges 21:25 , “ In those days EX was no king in Israel : every man did DT which was right in his own eyes . ” DT U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1973 IN a human being in a mother 's womb is not yet a life , so PRP can be killed . God calls PRP murder ( Exodus 20:13 ) . ABORTION : HANDS DT SHED INNOCENT BLOOD !!! PRP is hard to even imagine how a society MD ever become so ungodly , uncaring , indifferent , calloused and far from God , IN their leaders MD justify murdering human life . And now in JJ NNS infanticide is legal , where a child is murdered while being delivered , and in Illinois , after leaving DT womb . Ungodly NN Of Illinois Declares Open Season On NNS : Removes All Bans On Abortions ! 2nd Timothy 3:12 , “ Yea , and all WDT will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution . ” I am VBG to quote a rather lengthy passage from 1st Peter , to help PRP see DT full context of what DT apostle Peter is teaching PRP . DT Bible teaches IN when a Christian separates from their old life of sin , and from their old worldly acquaintances , PRP will VB PRP strange , criticizing PRP and persecuting PRP in JJ NNS . ... DT Bible admonishes Christians not to be surprised IN worldly NNS hate PRP , persecute PRP and separate from PRP over our faith and stand for Christ . Jesus VBD in John 15:19 IN if PRP were of DT NN , PRP MD receive PRP ; but because PRP are not of DT NN , PRP are followers of Christ our Savior , DT NN hates PRP . John 7:7 says PRP really hate Jesus , and IN PRP see Christ in PRP . DT NN hates Jesus Christ !!! In Everything Gives Thanks ! Jesus miraculously healed ten men afflicted with DT horrible incurable NN of leprosy . Today EX is a cure for leprosy , since DT 1940's , but in Bible times EX was n't and PRP was a much feared NN . Unbelievably , only CD man had enough gratitude to come back to thank DT Lord . Luke 17:17 , “ And Jesus answering VBD , Were EX not ten cleansed ? but where are DT nine ? ” EX are 86,400 seconds in each day , have PRP thanked God even once today for His abundant blessings ? PRP ought to thank God continually for our food , comforts , family , salvation , DT Holy Bible and manifold gifts WDT most NNS take for granted . James 1:17 , “ Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and cometh down from DT Father of lights , with whom is no variableness , neither shadow of turning . ” Every good thing in your life comes from God , whether PRP acknowledge DT fact or not . And RB , within God 's permissive will , everything bad WDT happens in our lives is allowed by God , which is a difficult truth to embrace . PRP live in a fallen NN because of sin , beginning with Adam ( Romans 5:12 ) . When Adam chose to sin , he opened DT floodgate of sin and death upon DT NN . This is why bad things happen to good NNS , and good things happen to bad NNS , and life is not fair ! Christians ought to be mindful of our blessings , especially in America where PRP have been blessed beyond all expectations compared to most of DT impoverished NN . Just DT privilege and opportunity to VB out to eat , in a fancy restaurants IN Chilies or Burger King ( DT 's fine dining to me ) , is something WDT most NNS living in DT NN cannot enjoy . PRP take so much for granted in America . PRP are so spoiled . PRP is a crying shame and DT epitome of utter ingratitude — IN amidst all these incredible blessings , liberty and modern comforts from God — IN Americans are sinfully steeped into sexual immorality , 60 million NNS murdered by abortion , homosexuals marriages and all manner of filth , evil and wickedness !!! God deserves so much better , but Americans treat Him IN garbage ! PRP really do as a NN ! How do PRP VB God feels IN PRP have allowed our NN to remove and ban DT Holy Bible from NNS 's lives ? Honestly , so PRP have any idea how detrimental WDT has been to our nation ? DT Bible is DT Sacred Book , DT only Book in existence WDT teaches mankind to LOVE , yet hateful and ungodly reprobates have used stupid excuses to rid NNS of DT only chance PRP have of growing up to become a loving human being ! I suffer in constant chronic neck pain . My wife divorced me against my will in 2006 , and I have lived alone ever since in DT Lord ( 1st Corinthians 7:27 ) . I have forgiven her completely , but as Dr. Jack Hyles wisely VBD : Divorce is a sin WDT perpetuates for a lifetime . I lost well over $ 100,000 as a result of DT divorce . I lost my home after DT divorce and have rented since . I lost my retirement . I lost my pets . I lost most of my possessions . I MD VB on and on for hours describing all DT pain , loss , suffering and heartache in my life over DT past 20 NNS . Pastor John K. Jenkins Sr. exposes DT evils of divorce in his excellent sermon titled : DT Devastating Demon WDT Destroys Families . I am as much a sinner as my former wife , so I do not point fingers . EX are no perfect marriages . God says when PRP marry someone , PRP become CD with them , so as far as I 'm concerned her sins throughout our marriage were my sins too . PRP HAVE SINNED ! Albeit , despite my misery , problems , pain and broken heart , I have DT joy of DT Lord in my soul . I have peace IN a river . Isaiah 26:3 , “ Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee : because he trusteth in thee . ” I love DT Bible verse ! DT is a solemn promise from our great God . DT Lord promises perfect peace to DT believer whose mind dwells and remains upon God. Psalms 1:1 - 2 , “ Blessed is DT man WDT walketh not in DT counsel of DT ungodly , nor standeth in DT way of sinners , nor sitteth in DT seat of DT scornful . But his delight is in DT law of DT LORD ; and in his law doth he meditate day and night . ” DT Bible says DT reason why PRP have perfect peace is because PRP trust DT Lord . Perfect peace comes from trusting God in everything ! I choose to love , forgive , help , work and pray in DT Lord , instead of worry , complain , hate harbor bitterness and place God on trial . I am VBG to continue to trust DT Lord , though He slay me . Job 13:15 , “ Though he slay me , yet will I trust in him : but I will maintain mine own ways before him . ” I am VBG to love everybody . I choose to forgive everyone even before PRP ask . I am trying by God 's grace to help as JJ NNS as I can . I labor night and day for DT Lord . I pray because Jesus VBD without Him PRP can do nothing ( John 15:5 ) . I need God 's help in everything I do . Galatians 2:20 , “ I am crucified with Christ : nevertheless I live ; yet not I , but Christ liveth in me : and DT life which I now live in DT flesh I live by DT faith of DT Son of God , who loved me , and gave himself for me . ” Everywhere I VBP today , I meet NNS who have contempt for Christians , churches and DT Holy Bible , but PRP claim to love God . PRP are deceived . Nobody loves God who despises DT King James Bible ! Although JJ churches are corrupt , DT CHURCH has never been ( nor ever MD be ) corrupted . Likewise , DT INCORRUPTIBLE WORDS OF GOD cannot be corrupted ( 1st Peter 1:23 ) . DT corrupted modern Bible versions are NOT God 's inspired Words . PRP can VB DT truth of God into a lie all PRP VBP ( Romans 1:25 ) , but PRP cannot VB DT TRUTH ! ... Listen to me dear reader , whatever your hang up MD be — whether PRP be struggling with sin , religious scrupulosity , finding God 's will , depression or confusion — VB into DT Scriptures and PRP will grow ! 1st Timothy 4:13 - 15 , “ Till I come , give attendance to reading , to exhortation , to doctrine . Neglect not DT gift WDT is in thee , which was given thee by prophecy , with DT laying on of DT hands of DT presbytery . Meditate upon these things ; give thyself wholly to them ; IN thy profiting MD appear to all . ” When somebody tells me IN PRP are struggling with sin , I always point them toward DT Holy Bible . Psalms 119:9 , “ Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way ? by taking heed thereto according to thy word . ” PRP cannot heed God 's Word if PRP are not familiar with DT contents of God 's Word . SEARCH DT SCRIPTURES !!! PRP was 23rd U.S. NNP Benjamin Harris ( 1833 -1901 ) who wisely VBD : Dear friend , DT Holy Bible Has Always Been DT Answer . MD to God IN PRP still had DT kind of wisdom today in leadership . I have been watching DT Forensic Files , and in nearly every case of a person being convicted of First Degree Murder , DT NN refuses to use capital punishment . DT is DT sordid wisdom of this foolish and ungodly NN . I am 100 % for capital punishment , because DT is God 's wisdom . Please read : “ DT CASE FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT : HOW PRP SAVED MY LIFE ” ( a needful doctrinally sound book by Dr. Max D. Younce ) . DT foolish NN never comes to their senses ! 2nd Timothy 3:7 , “ Ever learning , and never able to come to DT knowledge of DT truth . ” DT newsmedia reports DT problem . Career professionals VBP DT problem . Talk shows exploit DT problem . NN legislates DT problem . Police control DT problem . HUMANITY IS DT PROBLEM ! I thank God for His precious inspired Word in DT King James Bible , which is our Lamp . Psalms : 119:105 , “ Thy word is a lamp unto my feet , and a light unto my path . ” Humanity is DT problem , because of our inherent sinful nature . DT answer is DT ' GOOD NN ' ( GOSPEL ) of DT Lord Jesus Christ crucified on DT cross for our sins , buried and bodily resurrected DT third day for our justification ! John 6:47 , “ Verily , verily , I say unto PRP , He WDT believeth on me hath everlasting life . ” How Permanent Is Your Salvation ? Mark 1:15 : “... repent ye , and believe DT gospel . ” “ DT mark of DT child of God is IN he loves everybody ! ” And Jesus answering saith unto them , Have faith in God . Ye Must Be Born Again ! | PRP Need HIS Righteousness !"

After weeks of generally optimistic statements , officials are now warning PRP to prepare for DT worst . Over DT past several days PRP have seen DT number of confirmed NNS outside of NNP escalate dramatically , and this has really rattled JJ financial markets . After being down more than 1,000 points on Monday , DT Dow Jones Industrial Average fell another 879 points on Tuesday . U.S. stocks have lost more then 1.7 trillion dollars in value in just two days . Much more importantly , a wave of tremendous panic is starting to sweep across America , and PRP looks IN this crisis is just getting started . Usually officials at DT CDC choose their words very carefully so IN PRP do not needlessly alarm DT NN . With DT in mind , I MD VB for PRP to consider three statements WDT DT CDC’s Dr. Nancy Messonnier made about a potential outbreak inside DT NNP NNPS during a press conference on Tuesday … # 1 “ PRP ’s not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country anymore but a question of when this will happen . ” # 2 “ Disruption to everyday life MD be severe . ” # 3 “ PRP are asking DT American NN to prepare for DT expectation IN this might be bad . ” Can PRP ever recall a top CDC official ever making statements this ominous ? In addition , Messonnier warned IN PRP MD soon become necessary for schools and businesses to greatly restrict person to person contact … DT CDC outlined what schools and businesses will likely need to do if DT NN - CD NN becomes an epidemic outbreak in DT U.S. Schools should consider dividing students into smaller groups or close and use “ internet - based tele - schooling , ” Dr. Nancy Messonnier , director of DT CDC ’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases , told reporters on a conference call . “ For adults , businesses can replace in - person meetings with video or telephone conferences and increase teleworking options , ” Messonnier VBD . On a temporary basis such measures MD not be too disruptive , but what if this NN just keeps spreading month after month ? PRP are potentially facing a scenario WDT is truly unprecedented , and PRP is becoming increasingly clear IN officials have lost confidence IN PRP will be able to contain this NN . In fact , CD former U.S. official told USA Today IN “ DT horse is out of DT barn ” … Dennis Carroll , former director of DT U.S. Agency for International Development ’s NNP NNP Security and Development Unit , credited NNP ’s “ extraordinary control measures ” with delaying DT spread of DT NN . But he VBD avoiding a pandemic is “ very unlikely . ” “ DT dramatic uptick of NNS in South Korea , Iran and Italy are reflective of a self - sustaining spreading of DT NN , ” Carroll , who now leads DT NNP Virome Project NN cooperative , told USA TODAY . “ And a clear message IN DT horse is out of DT barn . ” At this point EX are still only a few dozen confirmed NNS in DT NNP NNPS , but authorities are bracing for DT worst . If PRP can believe PRP , San Francisco Mayor London Breed just declared a NN of emergency because of this NN … Mayor London Breed declared a local emergency in San Francisco Tuesday amid DT NN outbreak , despite EX being no confirmed NNS among DT city ’s residents . “ Although EX are still zero confirmed NNS in San Francisco residents , DT JJ picture is changing rapidly , and PRP need to step - up preparedness , ” Breed VBD in a statement . “ PRP see DT NN spreading in JJ parts of DT NN every day , and PRP are taking DT necessary steps to protect San Franciscans from harm . ” And after being quite apathetic about this outbreak at first , NNS all over America are suddenly realizing IN PRP should be preparing for a potential pandemic . In fact , Silicon Valley investor Geoff Lewis created quite a stir when he asked for advice on stockpiling food . DT following is DT question WDT he posted on Twitter WDT caused so much of an uproar … If CD were hypothetically stockpiling four months of shelf stable food , what MD folks recommend ( optimizing for keto friendly ) ? PRP have n’t seen anything IN this in DT NNP NNPS in a very long NN . But PRP have n’t even had a single death from this NN in our country yet . How crazed will NNS VB when victims start dropping dead in DT streets IN PRP have been in Wuhan ? EX is now talk IN DT IOC MD potentially cancel or postpone DT Olympic Games in Tokyo . At CD NN such talk MD have seemed crazy , but this is how serious this outbreak has become . In Iran , DT number of confirmed NNS has now jumped to 95 , although JJ NNS believe IN DT true number is far , far higher . During a press conference on Monday , Iran ’s deputy NN minister attempted to downplay DT seriousness of this outbreak , but on Tuesday PRP learned IN he has been infected too … Iran ’s deputy NN minister VBD he has tested positive for DT novel NN and is in self - quarantine at his home just a day after he appeared at a NN conference in Tehran where he sought to quell fears about DT outbreak . Iraj Harirchi , DT head of Iran ’s counter - NN task force , announced DT illness in a video online while vowing IN authorities MD continue working to control DT spread . Apparently not wanting to be outdone , CD of DT officials in South Korea WDT was overseeing DT response to this outbreak decided to jump off a bridge … But in Seoul took on a more morbid tone Tuesday following reports in DT local press IN a civil servant from DT Ministry of Justice ’s Emergency Safety Planning Office jumped off a bridge in Seoul at around 5 am local NN Tuesday . DT official was CD of several individuals charged with overseeing DT NN ’s response to DT NN . As NNS soar and hysteria mounts , PRP suspect this NN wo n’t exactly help quiet DT NN ’s nerves . Suicide is never DT answer to anything , and PRP should all be praying for DT man ’s family . In Italy , DT number of confirmed NNS has grown by more than 15 times since Friday … Over in Italy , DT number of confirmed NNS has surpassed 300 to 322 , while DT number of dead climbed to 10 , according to Italian emergency chief Angelo Borrelli , who VBD DT newly deceased were over DT age of 80 . DT ’s up from just 20 confirmed NNS on Friday . Newly deceased were over 80 NNS old , says at press conference in Rome Tuesday . DT JJ infections include three NNS in southern Sicily region , Italian Civil Protection official Borrelli VBD . All of a sudden , NNS all over Europe are wanting to avoid Italians because of DT potential of catching DT NN . In most NNS DT fear is irrational , but PRP do VB IN an Italian just spread DT NN to a hotel in Spain ’s Canary Islands … Hundreds of staff and tourists staying at a hotel in Spain ’s Canary Islands were put under lockdown on Tuesday , El Pais newspaper reported . CD person who had stayed at DT establishment was later found to have tested positive for DT NN . I lived in Italy for a few NNS as a child , and I have a great love for DT country . PRP is so sad to watch what is happening over RB , but DT same things are VBG to start happening here . In fact , Dr. Messonnier has told DT NN IN now is DT NN “ to begin preparing ” for a massive outbreak … “ NNS are concerned about this situation – I MD say rightfully so , ” Messonnier VBD . “ But PRP are putting our concerns to work preparing . Now is DT NN for businesses , hospitals , communities , schools and everyday NNS to begin preparing as well . ” If PRP do prepare and all of this turns out to be a false alarm , at least PRP will be ready for DT next crisis WDT is coming . But if PRP do n’t do anything to prepare and things VBP really , really bad , PRP MD end up costing PRP dearly . If this NN starts spreading across DT NNP NNPS IN wildfire , PRP and your family will VB to minimize contact with DT NN as much as possible . So stock up on DT things PRP will need now , because when things start getting really crazy DT stores will be cleaned out very quickly . NN spreads to Germany , Switzerland , Croatia , Iraq , Spain , Algeria , Austria and Brazil while NNS explode in Italy by 45 % in CD day Over DT last 36 hours or so , DT NN spread has now been confirmed in a slew of JJ NNS , including Germany , Switzerland , Croatia , Iraq , Spain , Algeria and Austria . NNS are already confirmed in Belgium , Lebanon , Finland , Sweden , Egypt , Sri Lanka , Israel , Cambodia , Nepal , Afghanistan , Russia and JJ other NNS . An infection is now suspected in Brazil , which MD make PRP DT first South American nation to confirm a NN infection , bringing DT NN to a whole JJ continent . According to Brazil ’s NNP Ministry , CD test of a local patient has reportedly come back positive . A second confirmation test is necessary to make DT diagnosis “ official . ” These are irrefutable facts , yet PRP still have naysayers throughout DT NN and across DT cultural landscape who claim none of this is happening , IN DT NN bioweapon system is “ just another NN , ” or IN PRP ’s a grand hoax being perpetrated by all these NNS as some elaborate staged event to commit JJ suicide for some unknown reason . Pandemic denialism is essentially DT “ Flat NNP ” version of epidemiology . According to DT denialists , all DT nations listed above are faking PRP , sacrificing their national economics to carry out some sort of elaborate hoax for some unimaginable reason . Rush Limbaugh , meanwhile , still insists DT NN is just “ DT NN . ” PRP ’s a reminder why highly influential NNS should stick to their areas of expertise and not wander into areas where PRP very quickly demonstrate their shocking technical ignorance and lack of knowledge . NN infections exploded overnight in Italy , rising to 322 confirmed NNS , an increase of 100 from DT previous day . To try to stop DT spread of DT NN , Italy is running armed road blocks surrounding 12 towns , prohibiting road travel . According to DT Epoch Times , no NN in Italy even knows DT source of DT outbreak , completely obliterating any argument from WHO officials IN this is “ contained ” or “ not a pandemic . ” Via TET : Italian NN officials have n’t yet identified DT source of DT outbreak . Angelo Borrelli , DT head of DT Italian civil protection department , VBD DT case count grew from 222 to 322 , representing a 45 % increase , in a 24 - hour period from Monday evening to Tuesday evening . According to DT pandemic denialists , of course , Italy must be faking PRP for some reason . Yes , PRP ’s an insane idea , but DT ’s what is now being promoted by DT left - wing NN and even some conservative journalists . Notably , DT very bureaucrat in Iran who told everybody DT NN was no big deal is now infected himself . RB via TET : Only a day earlier , a coughing and heavily sweating Iraj Harirchi VBD at a televised NN conference in Tehran IN “ DT situation is almost stable in DT country . ” NNP Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour confirmed Harirchi had DT NN . Harirchi himself posted an online video saying he had PRP and IN he had quarantined himself at home . He promised IN authorities MD bring DT NN under control . DT ’s reassuring , huh ? DT very NN bureaucrat sitting in quarantine after accidentally getting infected is telling PRP all DT NN has PRP under control . DT irony is almost pure comedy , if PRP were n’t so tragic . San Franciso declares NN of emergency while NN tells PRP EX ’s no emergency at all San Francisco , meanwhile , has just declared a NN of emergency over DT NN , even when CDC officials claim EX are essentially zero confirmed NNS in San Francisco . According to DT SF Chronicle , Mayor London Breed VBD more resources need to be allocated , “ to make sure PRP are prepared , ” even while DT entire NN establishment in America claims EX ’s nothing to be prepared for in DT first place . So why did San Fran just declare an emergency , then ? DT CDC ’s insane policy of “ Do n’t Test , Do n’t Tell ” is keeping America in DT dark while DT epidemic explodes across U.S. cities ."

Political leaders keep close tabs on PRP . Others flat out disparage PRP . Indeed , uranium owns its share of controversy . For NNS , DT element has been tied to talk of nuclear weapons and DT birth of DT atomic age . Today , however , DT metal has taken on a different role -- in DT form of NN . In fact , much of DT enriched uranium stored in nuclear weapons from DT arms race has been rededicated to fueling DT NN 's nuclear power reactors , which provided DT NN with almost 14 percent of its electricity in 2010 [ source : Nuclear NNP Institute ] . And PRP 's extremely powerful , too . CD 7 - gram pellet of uranium fuel produces as much NN as 3.5 barrels of oil and 807 kilograms ( 1,779 pounds ) of coal [ source : Newfoundland Labrador DNR ] . Beyond lighting up homes and businesses through nuclear power , uranium makes radioisotopes WDT produce radiation , which can help diagnose and treat certain JJ conditions . PRP 's RB used for shielding and , in its depleted form , as counterweights for aircraft , too . But where does uranium come from and how is PRP gathered ? IN other metals , uranium occurs naturally in rocks on DT NNP 's surface and can be extracted through uranium mining . Miners originally discovered uranium alongside radium , another element WDT was used as glowing , decorative paint ( at least until NNS realized its harmful , radioactive effects ) . Uranium hit DT market as a decorative glaze before its nuclear properties were discovered . This heavy metal comes in several isotopes , or forms of DT element with different numbers of neutrons . Depending on DT stability of an isotope , some can be more radioactive ( likely to give off energetic particles ) and fissile ( likely to produce nuclear fission ) than others . Uranium - 238 measures as DT most abundant isotope of DT element on NNP and can be found in rocks and seawater . But PRP 's not as radioactive as uranium - 235 , DT best - known form of uranium used to create nuclear reactions . In this article , PRP 'll chart DT uranium mining process , tracking DT element as PRP transitions from ore to fuel pellets ready to be used by nuclear reactors . PRP 'll RB look at DT wax and wane of uranium mining , as well as DT risks for humans and DT environment by following DT contentious debate over mining uranium in DT backyard of DT U.S. 's most iconic canyon .

While flat earthers seem to trust and support scientific methods , what PRP do n’t trust is NNS , and DT established relationships between “ power ” and “ knowledge ” . This relationship between power and knowledge has long been theorised by sociologists . By exploring this relationship , PRP can begin to understand why EX is a swelling resurgence of flat earthers . Let me begin by stating quickly IN I ’m not really interested in discussing if DT NNP is flat or not ( for DT record , I ’m happily a “ globe earther ” ) – and I ’m not seeking to mock or denigrate this community . What ’s important here is not necessarily whether PRP believe DT NNP is flat or not , but instead what their resurgence and JJ conventions , such as DT NN in Birmingham , tell PRP about NN and knowledge in DT 21st century . Multiple competing models were suggested throughout DT weekend , including “ classic ” flat NN , domes , NN walls , diamonds , puddles with multiple worlds inside , and even DT NNP as DT inside of a giant cosmic egg . DT level of discussion however often did not revolve around DT models on offer , but on broader issues of attitudes towards existing structures of knowledge , and DT institutions WDT supported and presented these models . Flat earthers are not DT first group to be sceptical of existing power structures and their tight grasps on knowledge . This viewpoint is somewhat typified by DT work of Michel Foucault , a famous and heavily influential 20th century philosopher who made a career of studying those on DT fringes of society to understand what PRP MD tell PRP about everyday life . He is well known , among JJ other things , for looking at DT close relationship between power and knowledge . He suggested IN knowledge is created and used in a way WDT reinforces DT claims to legitimacy of those in power . At DT same NN , those in power control what is considered to be correct and incorrect knowledge . According to Foucault , EX is therefore an intimate and interlinked relationship between power and knowledge . At DT NN Foucault was writing on DT topic , DT control of power and knowledge had moved away from religious institutions , which previously had a very singular hold over knowledge and morality , and was instead beginning to move towards a network of scientific institutions , NN monopolies , legal courts , and bureaucratised governments . Foucault argued IN these institutions work to maintain their claims to legitimacy by controlling knowledge . In DT 21st century , PRP are witnessing another important shift in both power and knowledge due to factors WDT include DT increased availability of JJ platforms afforded by social NN . Knowledge is no longer centrally controlled and – as has been pointed out in DT wake of Brexit – DT age of DT expert MD be passing . Now , everybody has DT power to create and share content . When Michael Gove , a leading proponent of Brexit , proclaimed : “ I VBP DT NNS of this country have had enough of experts ” , PRP MD seem IN he , in JJ ways , meant PRP . PRP is RB clear IN PRP ’re seeing increased polarisation in society , as PRP continue to drift away from agreed singular narratives and move into camps around shared interests . Recent PEW research suggests , for example , IN 80 per cent of voters who backed Hillary NNP in DT 2016 NNP presidential election – and 81 per cent of NNP voters – believe most supporters of DT two candidates are unable to agree on basic facts , let alone policies . Despite early claims , from as far back as HG Wells ’s NNP Brain essays in 1936 , IN a worldwide , shared resource of knowledge , such as DT internet , MD create peace , harmony and a common interpretation of reality , PRP appears IN quite DT opposite has happened . With DT increased voice afforded by social NN to a wide range of views , knowledge has been increasingly decentralised , and competing narratives have emerged . This was something of a recurring theme throughout DT weekend in Birmingham , and was especially apparent when four flat earthers debated three physics PhD students . A particular point of contention occurred when CD of DT physicists pleaded with DT audience to avoid trusting YouTube and bloggers . DT audience and DT panel of flat earthers took exception to this , noting IN “ now PRP ’ve got DT internet and mass communication … PRP ’re not reliant on what DT mainstream are telling PRP in newspapers , PRP can decide for ourselves ” . PRP was readily apparent IN DT flat earthers were keen to separate knowledge from scientific institutions . At DT same NN as scientific claims to knowledge and power are being undermined , some power structures are decoupling themselves from scientific knowledge , moving towards a kind of populist politics WDT is increasingly sceptical of knowledge . This has , in recent NNS , manifested itself in extreme ways – and can be seen in such examples as JJ figures showing support for Pizzagate or NNP ’s suggestions IN Ted Cruz ’s father shot JFK . But PRP can RB be seen in more subtle and insidious forms : in DT way in which Brexit , for example , was campaigned for in terms of gut feelings and emotions rather than expert statistics and predictions . NN is increasingly facing problems with its ability to communicate ideas publicly , a problem WDT flat earthers , and politicians , are able to circumvent with moves towards populism . Again , this theme occurred throughout DT weekend . Flat earthers were encouraged to trust “ poetry , freedom , passion , vividness , creativity , and yearning ” over DT more clinical regurgitation of established theories and facts . Attendees were told IN “ hope changes everything ” , and were warned against blindly trusting what PRP were told . This is a narrative echoed by some of DT celebrities who have used their power to back flat NNP beliefs , such as DT musician BOB , who tweeted : “ Do n’t believe what I say , research what I say . ” In JJ ways , a JJ meeting of flat earthers is a product and sign of our NN ; a reflection of our increasing distrust in scientific institutions , and DT moves by power - holding institutions towards populism and emotions . In much DT same way IN Foucault reflected on what social outcasts MD reveal about our social systems , EX is a lot IN flat earthers can reveal to PRP about DT current changing relationship between power and knowledge . And judging by DT success of this UK event – and DT large conventions planned in Canada and America this NN – PRP seems DT flat NNP is VBG to be around for a while yet .

BASF , a German chemical company , announced on 16 January IN PRP will end production of GM crops for DT European market and move its plant - NN headquarters from Limburgerhof in Germany to DT NNP NNPS . PRP will RB close other sites in Germany and Sweden , though PRP will maintain existing facilities in Belgium and Berlin . “ EX is still a lack of acceptance for this technology in JJ parts of Europe from DT majority of consumers , farmers and politicians , ” says Stefan Marcinowski , a member of BASF ’s board . “ PRP does not make business sense to continue investing in products exclusively for cultivation in this market . ” BASF will discontinue DT marketing of DT Amflora potato , CD of only two GM crops authorised for cultivation by DT European Commission . This will leave Monsanto ’s MON810 maize as DT only GM crop authorised for cultivation and marketed in DT EU . Environmental campaigners cheered DT move as a vindication of European consumers ’ rejection of DT technology . “ PRP ’s not often IN PRP share an analysis with BASF , but PRP ’re right IN EX ’s no demand , ” says Mute Schimpf , a food campaigner with Friends of DT NNP . But DT biotechnology sector warned IN Europe risks falling behind its JJ competitors because of “ scaremongering and misinformation ” about this emerging NN , which changes DT DNA of crops to make them more efficient . Werner Langen , a German centre - right MEP , says IN DT decision by BASF “ shows IN DT patchwork of national regulations made in this field has made Europe an unattractive location ” for GM research . While authorisations of GM crops have increased steadily in other parts of DT NN , particularly DT Americas , approval has been stalled in Europe for several NNS because of political opposition . Around 50 GM crops grown outside DT EU have been authorised for import , mostly used for industrial use or animal feed . Member NNS remain divided over DT issue of GM crops . A blocking minority of NNS – including Austria , Hungary , Poland and Greece – has refused to accept JJ authorisations for GM cultivation . This has irritated pro-GM NNS such as DT Netherlands , Spain , Sweden and DT UK , which are eager to deploy DT technology . DT Commission has been able to authorise only these two crops for cultivation , and some member NNS have imposed national bans . These bans were eventually found to be illegal under single market rules . Seeking a compromise , DT Commission proposed allowing member NNS to enact their own national bans , with DT implicit understanding IN in exchange PRP MD stop blocking JJ authorisations . But DT proposal has remained stalled because DT anti-GM NNS VBP to be able to ban DT crops on DT basis of environmental or NN concerns . DT Commission argues IN this is not possible , because food cannot be deemed safe in CD country but unsafe in another . Last week ’s announcement by BASF IN PRP is abandoning its production of GM crops in Europe because of a lack of acceptance “ from DT majority of consumers , farmers and politicians ” was an acknowledgement of a reality JJ biotechnology companies have been hesitant to countenance – Europe does not VB genetically modified crops . A 2010 Eurobarometer survey found IN 70 % of Europeans VBP IN GM food is “ fundamentally unnatural ” , and 59 % say IN such food is unsafe for their NN . A 2003 NN NN in DT NNP Kingdom found IN only 2 % of Britons MD be happy to eat GM foods . So - called frankenfood , as DT British tabloid press has dubbed them , have had a rough welcome in Europe . In December 2010 CD million signatures calling for a ban on GM crops were delivered to DT Commission as DT first ‘ citizens initiative ’ created by DT Lisbon treaty . But Europeans are virtually alone in this staunch resistance to GM crops . In north and south America , genetically modified crops have been introduced into DT food chain without anyone much noticing or caring . A 2006 NN by DT Pew Research Group showed IN Americans remain largely unaware of DT existence of GM crops , with only 40 % having heard of them and only 26 % believing PRP have eaten them . DT majority of Americans say PRP do not have concerns about GM crops . JJ perception has translated into JJ policy . DT EU ’s two approvals of GM crops for cultivation do not match DT more than 80 in DT NNP and 36 in Brazil . NNP and India are RB approving more GM crops , albeit more cautiously than in DT Americas . DT European Commission has tried to alleviate member NN concerns about DT crops by offering to let them opt out of EU authorisation , but DT issue is stuck in DT Council . Today 10 % of DT NN ’s arable land is growing GM crops . A report published by Friends of DT NNP last NN found IN less than 0.06 % of EU fields contain GM crops . Carel du Marchie Sarvaas of EuropaBio attributes DT better reception of GM crops in DT NNP NNPS to faster movement by DT industry . “ In DT NNP , DT technology was already RB when DT anti-GM movement came on NNS ’s radar , ” he says . “ In DT Americas EX ’s much greater faith in NN as a tool for progress , and DT food industry in DT Americas has been very supportive of NN . ” But according to Friends of DT NNP , DT increased focus in Europe is DT result of work by non-governmental organisations to bring DT issue to DT NN ’s attention . “ A lot of European consumers are concerned about DT open questions of NN with GM crops , ” she says . “ In north and south America PRP have no labelling system , and consumers are not aware of what ’s VBG on . ” “ PRP cannot ignore DT massive opposition in Europe , ” says Ladislav Miko , deputy director - general for DT food chain in DT Commission ’s NN department . “ This is why PRP believe DT issue needs more clarity and more JJ information . ” “ NNS need to be convinced EX are benefits for DT normal citizen , ” he adds . “ If PRP VBP DT benefit is just for farmers and companies , NNS wo n’t support DT . ” Environmental campaigners are urging DT anti-GM NNS to stand their ground , saying PRP is reasonable to have different NN concerns in different NNS . “ Europe is quite diverse , PRP have specific ecosystems in different member NNS , ” says Schimpf . She is unaware of any other products WDT have different environmental concerns in different NNS , but says GM crops are unlike other products of concern because PRP can multiply and PRP enter DT food chain . GM crops have been around for 15 NNS , and to date no adverse NN effects from approved strains have been documented anywhere in DT NN . European consumers are already eating meat from animals raised on GM feed imported into DT EU , and no adverse NN effects have been found . But environmental campaigners say not enough is yet known about DT NN effects , and more research is needed before PRP are embraced . “ DT EU needs to follow DT precautionary principle , ” says Schimpf . But advocates of GM crops say IN such hesitation is foolish when DT potential of DT technology to solve societal challenges is so large . “ PRP have a rapidly increasing population , PRP have to produce more food and PRP have to do PRP more sustainably , ” says Carel du Marchie Sarvaas , a director with EuropaBio , a pan-European biotechnology industry group . “ DT only way to do DT is to produce more from DT same amount of land . [ GM crops ] allow farmers to produce more yield per hectare . ” He adds IN more efficient crops mean less NN spent tilling DT land , translating to fewer CO2 NNS from farm equipment . In Spain , DT EU country WDT has embraced GM crops most enthusiastically , farmers have reported getting from 6 % to 30 % more yield by using Monsanto ’s MON810 maize . Between 2010 and 2011 , Spain saw a 27 % increase in DT acreage planted . Portugal , which started planting GM later , saw a 59 % increase during DT NN . Much has been made of DT potential of GM crops to combat famine in Africa , and Bill Gates has been CD of DT leading advocates of DT technology to help developing NNS ( see interview , Page 4 ) . Strains of drought - resistant maize are currently being developed , as well as NN - resistant strains of staple crops . But JJ groups and governments remain doubtful about DT technology . Aside from DT perceived uncertainty around NN , campaigners are RB concerned IN DT use of GM crops is giving rise to pesticide - resistant plants . Biotechnology companies have insisted IN this trend is not linked to DT use of GM crops , but is a normal problem encountered when crops are not properly rotated . Ethical objections have RB been raised to DT practice of patenting DT GM seeds . Farmers normally pay a CD - NN price for seeds , which PRP can then save and replant . But GM seeds are acquired through DT payment of a licence fee for DT intellectual property . This was DT case for BASF ’s Amflora potato . “ PRP ’s a democratic question – do PRP VB to allow a few companies to control what PRP eat ? ” asks Schimpf . But with DT rest of DT NN increasingly embracing GM crops , is PRP possible for Europe to be a GM - free continent ? DT question is being asked at both a macro and micro level . Even if DT anti-GM NNS secure DT right to enact national bans on environmental grounds , EX are questions over cross-fertilisation from neighbouring NNS . If Austria enacts a ban , DT wind can carry seeds from neighbouring Germany , campaigners warn . EuropaBio rejects this argument . “ Political realism means PRP accept IN DT way forward is IN some NNS will choose to grow GM crops and some won’t , ” says du Marchie Sarvaas . “ PRP can exist as non -GM ‘ islands ’ , ” he says , adding IN some farms grow GM crops alongside conventional crops and EX is still no cross-fertilisation . “ But Europe cannot determine what DT NNS from whom PRP import grow , and DT ’s DT challenge . ” This challenge has already been encountered . Last NN DT Commission was forced to end its zero - tolerance policy for imports , which barred a shipment from entering DT EU if PRP contained any trace of a GM strain not authorised in DT EU . This was changed to a threshold of 0.1 % after some crops were mistakenly sent back . With so JJ GM crops being used in DT Americas , NNS of contamination in imports are a concern . But Schimpf says DT embrace of GM crops in DT Americas should not pressure DT EU into VBG in DT same direction . “ For me , PRP ’s DT same as when PRP have higher labour standards , ” she says . “ PRP can insist IN importers must comply with EU standards . Europe MD n’t authorise a car just because PRP was authorised in NNP , PRP VBP to have our own safety checks . ” With DT expansion of GM planting across DT NN , DT pressure on DT EU to make up its mind CD way or DT other will only increase ."

""_''","NNS look for usable clothing among rubble in DT Petobo neighborhood which was hit by an earthquake and liquefaction in Palu , Central Sulawesi , Indonesia , October 8 , 2018 . When DT violent shaking from a massive magnitude 7.5 earthquake finally stopped , Selvi Susanti stood up and realized something strange was happening . First , she saw DT ground suddenly begin to sink . Then DT pavement split beneath her feet IN a broken dinner plate and started to rise . Terrified , she clung to a small sliver of asphalt and surfed a river of fast - moving mud as PRP swallowed entire neighborhoods , carrying her higher than coconut trees for a quarter of a mile . "" What I saw — oh my God ! Houses were tumbling . PRP started to roll IN waves . PRP 's IN a tsunami , but DT difference was PRP were waves of soil , "" VBD Susanti , 38 , weeping at DT memory of seeing so JJ NNS simply disappear into DT NN as PRP screamed for help . "" PRP felt IN I was in a boat , moving around . But DT difference is I was not in NN , but in DT mud . "" JJ , IN Susanti in DT devastated village of Petobo , had no idea PRP were in an area already identified by DT NN as a high - risk zone for DT devastating geological phenomenon WDT causes soft ground to liquefy during earthquakes . But Indonesian scientist Gegar Prasetya was n't surprised by any of DT events WDT occurred at dusk on Sept. 28 , killing nearly 2,000 NNS and leaving possibly thousands more missing . He had warned NNS for NNS IN DT area around Sulawesi island 's Palu Bay had been struck before and was due for another potential combination of factors to create a perfect storm capable of unleashing earthquakes , landslides , tsunami waves and soil liquefaction . "" I knew right away , "" VBD Prasetya , co-founder of DT Tsunami Research Center Indonesia , who had met with NN officials and residents in DT area to try to raise awareness about DT threat . "" I posted in our group , and I VBD , ' PRP 's happened . ' "" Disaster - prone Indonesia , part of DT Pacific Basin 's "" Ring of Fire , "" is an archipelago of about 17,000 islands sitting atop numerous fault lines WDT have produced some of DT largest and most deadly earthquakes , tsunamis and volcanic eruptions in recorded history . Other NNS around DT NN wondered how this type of earthquake — on a strike - slip fault , which typically does not produce dangerous tsunamis — MD generate waves WDT surged as high as 6 meters ( 20 feet ) . He had published a paper nearly two decades ago highlighting six other tsunamis recorded in DT Makassar Strait in DT past century , predicting IN a repeat event MD be expected roughly every 25 NNS . DT last NN occurred in a region north of DT city in 1996 . Before DT , Palu Bay was hit in 1968 by a very similar magnitude 7.4 quake WDT generated waves 10 meters ( 33 feet ) high . "" This CD complete village went to DT NN , "" he VBD of DT 1968 event . "" PRP can still see DT trees from DT top of DT NN . "" Some experts theorize IN DT Sept. 28 quake , by itself , did n't generate a big wave despite being shallow and near DT coast . PRP 're convinced PRP was instead DT area 's soft soil WDT served as DT real catalyst for disaster . DT temblor 's long , violent shaking likely triggered CD or more underwater landslides due to unstable sediment deposited on DT seafloor by rivers . This disruptive movement MD have created DT large wall of NN WDT raced across DT open ocean until being squeezed into DT long , narrow bay WDT surrounds Palu , forcing DT wave to grow higher . "" Imagine what happens if PRP drop a brick in a flat pond — ripples spread in all directions , "" VBD Robert Hall , a geologist at Royal Holloway University of London , who has studied DT area . "" Now drop DT same size object in a bathtub . DT waves can reflect off DT sides , can amplify , and MD VB larger in DT direction of DT length of DT bath . "" But PRP was n't just weak sediment in DT ocean WDT gave way . Wet , sandy soil RB separated and came alive through liquefaction in some areas due to DT earthquake 's radical vibrations . DT ground simply lost its strength and turned to mush beneath NNS 's feet , creating mud WDT acted IN quicksand . NNS , houses , cars and streets were swallowed and covered by a thick carpet of what — just seconds earlier — had been solid NN . Fast - moving landslides RB were launched above ground , possibly causing even more localized tsunami waves . "" PRP MD n't necessarily expect to VB all DT worst possible factors occurring together , "" VBD Willem De Lange , a scientist from DT University of Waikato in NNP Zealand who co-authored research on DT area with Prasetya in 2001 . "" Unfortunately this does happen . "" JJ questions remain about exactly what happened in this complex disaster . Prasetya will begin field work with DT Indonesian navy this week to try to better understand what occurred under NN , and a team of international experts are expected to arrive next month to carry out an assessment . Palu 's population has exploded in JJ high - risk areas since DT 1968 event , which killed 200 NNS and RB turned soil to mud in places , leaving JJ newcomers vulnerable with no local history . However , DT central NN did produce a map in 2012 identifying large swaths of Palu , a city of 380,000 NNS , where liquefaction MD occur . DT area of Petobo , for instance , was classified as having high - risk potential . DT report RB recommended IN housing and industrial areas should best be built in areas with low liquefaction risk . PRP suggested mitigation efforts , including building structures with deep foundations anchored into firmer layers of NN . Good urban planning is ultimately DT key to saving lives , VBD Sri Hidayati , head of earthquake mitigation at DT NNP Ministry 's Geology Agency , which produced DT report WDT was shared with DT provincial and district governments in Sulawesi . She VBD PRP 's her agency 's responsibility to provide DT mapping , but PRP 's up to local authorities to "" use PRP or not . "" Calls Monday to Palu 's vice mayor and DT mayor 's aid went unanswered . "" If everything in DT future is planned based on this , I VBP maybe PRP will only experience a small number of casualties in case such a disaster occurs again , "" she VBD . "" Or probably no casualties at all . "" At a NN conference in Jakarta on Monday , DT head of DT country 's disaster agency RB confirmed IN soft soil areas in Palu are not fit for housing . "" PRP is impossible to rebuild in areas with high liquefaction risk such as Petobo and Balaroa , "" he VBD , adding IN NNS still living RB will be relocated . Indonesia has been criticized for lifting DT tsunami warning PRP issued for Sulawesi 's coast too soon . DT earthquake knocked out power and telecommunication towers , meaning sirens did n't wail and alerts did n't light up mobile phones . Online video showed an unsettling scene as cars and motorbikes drove at normal speeds on a coastal road and oblivious NNS milled about on DT beach while DT large , fast - moving wave MD be seen racing closer before exploding onshore . "" PRP 's almost impossible for a tsunami warning system to predict what PRP saw DT other day , "" VBD Adam Switzer , a tsunami expert at DT NNP Observatory of Singapore . "" DT earthquake is DT warning . If PRP 're anywhere in southeast Asia and PRP 're on DT coast and PRP feel an earthquake , move inland and move to higher ground and stay RB . "" But PRP 's RB not a matter of only warning NNS just before something happens . Prasetya VBD DT history and geology of Palu Bay must be considered in plans to rebuild . He VBD soil investigations should be carried out to determine if deep piles are needed to stabilize buildings . Local knowledge should RB be considered as a cheap way to save lives , such as constructing houses out of wood with thatched roofs , instead of concrete and tile . In Petobo , tsunami warnings MD not have helped because EX was no NN to respond . All DT remains of DT village , located about 30 minutes from DT center of Palu , is a muddy wasteland where only DT very tips of roofs remain above ground in places . Satellite images show a heavily populated area stretching more than 100 hectares ( 250 acres ) being devoured by what looks IN a giant layer of chocolate milk . In mobile phone videos , buildings are seen sliding IN pucks across a slab of NN . Some NNS spent hours trying to find their homes after DT disaster , locating them about 2 kilometers ( 1.2 miles ) from where PRP once stood . "" PRP felt IN PRP were spinning in a blender , "" recalled Susanti , who survived by leaping to solid ground and running after DT mud flow finally slowed down . "" I saw houses VB position . Houses which were located at DT east moved to DT west and vice versa . I saw DT twisted mud was shaped IN dough . "" Recovering bodies from Petobo and other hard - hit areas , such as Balaroa , has been difficult because heavy equipment will sink in DT soft soil and is unusable RB . DT NN is considering turning some of these sites into mass graves , according to Wiranto , Indonesia 's security minister , who uses CD name . "" PRP is already a ghost village . I will not VB back RB even if PRP pay me 1 billion rupiah ( $ 65,800 ) , "" VBD Erli Yati , 32 , who RB survived what 's been dubbed a "" land tsunami "" by some in Petobo . She had no idea about DT previous disasters RB or IN DT ground MD come alive as PRP did . "" I will not step back to DT place again , "" she added . "" DT was DT worse experience I have ever had . "" Prasetya commended DT idea of closing off liquefaction areas and VBD mitigation — whether PRP 's creating and enforcing proper building codes in at - risk zones or relocating NNS to safer places — should be implemented before DT next disaster . "" How JJ souls need to be sacrificed until DT NN knows mitigation is important ? "" he asked , adding he 's been sounding alarms since DT massive 2004 earthquake - spawned tsunami off Sumatra island killed 230,000 NNS in a dozen nations , more than half of them in Indonesia . "" Everything is back to business as usual . """

DT Hayabusa2 spacecraft 's Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout ( MASCOT ) will land at a site in DT asteroid Ryugu 's southern hemisphere dubbed MA - 9 , mission officials announced today ( Aug. 23 ) . MA - 9 won out over nine other finalists because PRP offered DT best combination of scientific potential and accessibility , MASCOT team members VBD . [ Japan 's Hayabusa2 Asteroid Sample - Return Mission in Pictures ] "" From our perspective , DT selected landing site means IN PRP engineers can guide MASCOT to DT asteroid 's surface in DT safest way possible , while DT NNS can use their various instruments in DT best possible way , "" MASCOT project manager Tra-Mi Ho , of DT DLR Institute of Space Systems , VBD in a statement . ( DLR is DT German Aerospace Center , which operates MASCOT with support from DT French space agency , CNES . ) MA - 9 features relatively fresh , pristine surface material WDT has n't been exposed to cosmic radiation for long compared to other parts of DT 3,000 - foot - wide ( 950 meters ) asteroid , team members VBD . And Hayabusa2 will drop three small rovers onto patches of DT space rock 's northern hemisphere , so a southern site for DT 22 - lb. ( 10 kilograms ) MASCOT will give DT mission greater coverage of DT space rock , PRP added . In addition , MA - 9 is n't quite as boulder - studded as most other Ryugu regions . DT does n't mean landing EX will be a breeze on Oct. 3 , however . "" But PRP are RB aware : EX seem to be large boulders across most of Ryugu 's surface and barely [ any ] surfaces with flat regolith , "" Ho added . "" Although scientifically very interesting , this is RB a challenge for a small lander and for sampling . "" DT $ 150 million Hayabusa2 mission launched in December 2014 and arrived at Ryugu on June 27 of this NN . If all goes according to plan , DT spacecraft will VB DT big asteroid from orbit for another 16 months and RB drop down several times to grab samples of Ryugu material . Meanwhile , MASCOT and DT three tiny , hopping rovers — known as Minerva - II - 1a , Minerva - II - 1 b and Minerva - II - 2 — will gather a variety of information about DT asteroid from its surface . ( Minerva - I flew aboard Japan 's first asteroid - sampling mission , DT original Hayabusa , which returned grains from DT space rock Itokawa to NNP in 2010 . ) DT Hayabusa2 orbiter is scheduled to depart from Ryugu in December 2019 . DT capsule containing DT mission 's asteroid samples will come down to NNP a NN later , in December 2020 . Hayabusa2 is n't DT only asteroid - sampling project underway . NASA 's $ 800 million OSIRIS - REx ( Origins , Spectral Interpretation , Resource Identification , Security , Regolith Explorer ) mission is on its final approach toward DT asteroid Bennu , and should arrive in orbit around DT 1,650 - foot - wide ( 500 m ) rock this December . OSIRIS - REx's samples are due to land on NNP in September 2023 . Both Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS - REx aim to help NNS better understand asteroid composition and structure , DT early history and evolution of DT solar system , and DT role space rocks MD have played in helping life VB a start on NNP .

""_''","This week , a particularly odd little bit of pseudoscience reared its head again when rapper B.o.B. took to Twitter and proclaimed IN DT NNP is flat . Since then , DT rapper has drawn DT ire of all sorts of incredulous NNS , including astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson . NNS have known IN DT NNP is round since at least DT sixth century B.C.E . So JJ were surprised to hear DT flat NNP concept still kicked around . But this was n't DT first resurgance of DT idea . Back in DT 1970s and ‘ 80s , a man named Charles Kenneth Johnson became a minor celebrity for his refusal to believe DT NNP is round , Cheryl Eddy writes for iO9 . Johnson ’s good friend Samuel Shenton founded a small fringe group dubbed DT Flat NNP Society in DT 1950s . In 1972 Johnson became DT NN of DT society after Shenton 's death , transforming DT group from a small collection of NN theorists into an organization with thousands of members . He made waves in DT national NN and became known for cheerfully insisting DT rest of DT NN was being duped by NNS , Douglas Martin wrote in Johnson ’s obituary for DT NNP York Times in 2001 . '' If NN were a ball spinning in space , EX MD be no up or down , '' Johnson told David Gates and Jennifer Smith for Newsweek in 1984 . Similarly , Johnson ’s wife Marjory believed IN DT NNP must be flat , because otherwise she MD have spent her childhood in her native Australia hanging upside - down by her toes , Martin wrote at DT NN . During his tenure as NN of DT Flat NNP Society , its ranks swelled to about 3,500 NNS . In his newsletters , Johnson wrote off such spectacles IN DT sunrise and sunset as optical illusions , discussed how Charles Lindbergh proved DT NNP was flat , and claimed IN NASA and DT moon landing were nothing but hoaxes , Eddy writes . "" PRP ca n't orbit a flat NN , "" Johnson told Robert J. Schadewald for NNP Digest in 1980 . "" DT Space Shuttle is a joke — and a very ludicrous joke . "" Ironically , Johnson lived just over DT hill from Edwards Air Force Base in southern California — DT facility where DT Air Force tests experimental aircraft , and where NASA ’s Space Shuttles landed after returning to NNP . While most of DT articles about Johnson and his fringe beliefs were written with tongue firmly in cheek , he channeled his odd sort of fame into increasing membership in DT Flat NNP Society ( as well as a starring role in an NN cream commercial ) . But PRP did n’t last : By DT NN Johnson died , DT society had dwindled again to just 100 members . DT Flat NNP Society is still around , though PRP remain little more than a tiny fringe group . "" PRP is always good to question ' how PRP VBP what PRP VBP ' , "" Christine Garwood , author of Flat NNP : DT History of an Infamous Idea , tells Brendan O'Neill for DT BBC . "" But PRP is RB good to have DT ability to accept compelling evidence — such as DT photographs of NNP from space . """

PRP will take DT first - ever direct images of its poles , while RB studying DT inner heliosphere — DT bubble - JJ region around DT sun created by DT stream of energized , charged particles released in DT solar wind . At its closest , Solar Orbiter will come within about 42 million km of DT sun : closer than DT scorched NN Mercury , just over a quarter of DT average distance between NNP and DT sun , and closer than any European spacecraft in history . To VB PRP into this unique orbit at DT center of DT solar system , edging close to DT sun ’s poles instead of orbiting in a ‘ flat ’ plane , IN DT planets , teams at mission control in Darmstadt , Germany , have planned an intricate path . Solar Orbiter is due to launch from Cape Canaveral , Florida , on an Atlas V 411 rocket supplied by NASA in early February . Once PRP has separated from DT launch vehicle , a 22 - minute automatic activation sequence takes place , after which point DT control team takes over DT reins for DT Launch and Early Orbit Phase ( LEOP ) . These early moments in DT life of a mission are critical . PRP is now IN DT spacecraft wakes up , extends its solar arrays and teams on DT ground check its NN after DT rigors of launch . Elements of Solar Orbiter ’s NN instruments are located along a 4.4 meter ‘ boom , ” which keeps them away from DT main body of DT spacecraft and any potential interference . This boom should be deployed before certain chemical thrusters are fired , which have DT potential to contaminate DT instruments during maneuvres . Once Solar Orbiter ’s systems and instruments are up and running , PRP enters into DT “ cruise phase , ” which will last until November 2021 . During this NN , PRP will perform two gravity - assist maneuvres around Venus and CD around NNP to alter DT spacecraft ’s trajectory , guiding PRP towards DT innermost regions of DT solar system . DT first close solar pass will take place at DT end of March 2022 at around a third of DT distance between NNP and DT sun . At this point , DT spacecraft will be in an elliptical orbit WDT initially takes 180 days to complete , making a close approach of DT sun every six months . Solar Orbiter ’s path will see PRP travel out of DT ‘ plane of DT ecliptic . ” So , instead of orbiting in DT same flat plane around DT sun as DT planets , moons and minor bodies of DT solar system , PRP will ‘ leap ’ up from DT solar equator , delivering views of DT sun ’s polar regions WDT have never been seen before . To do this , Solar Orbiter will not travel in a ‘ fixed ’ orbit . Instead , DT spacecraft will follow a constantly changing elliptical path WDT will be continually tilted and squeezed , edging PRP higher and higher and closer to DT sun ’s poles . As such , DT spacecraft ’s orbit has been chosen to be ‘ in resonance ’ with Venus , which means IN PRP will return to DT NN ’s vicinity every few orbits and can again use DT NN ’s gravity to alter or tilt its orbit . While Solar Orbiter initially orbits in DT same ‘ flat ’ plane as DT planets of DT solar system , each encounter with Venus will increase its inclination . This means IN each NN Solar Orbiter encounters DT sun , PRP will be looking at PRP from a different perspective . By DT end of 2021 , DT spacecraft will reach its first nominal orbit for NN , which is set to last for four NNS . During this NN , Solar Orbiter will reach 17° degrees of inclination , allowing DT spacecraft to capture high - resolution images of DT sun ’s poles , for DT first NN . During its proposed extended mission phase , Solar Orbiter MD lift into an even higher inclination orbit . At 33° above DT solar equator , DT polar regions MD come even more directly into view . Data gathered by Solar Orbiter will be stored on DT spacecraft , then beamed ( or , ‘ downlinked ’ ) to NNP during eight - hour communication windows , via DT 35 m Malargüe ground station in Argentina . Other Estrack stations such as NNP Norcia in Australia and Cebreros in Spain will act as backups . To survive getting so up - close and personal with our star , experiencing a maximum temperature of 520 degrees Celsius and receiving a barrage of intense radiation , Solar Orbiter ’s main body and vital instruments will be protected by a titanium heat shield WDT will face DT sun at all times . Even DT spacecraft ’s solar panels , designed to take in NN from DT sun , will need to be protected . As Solar Orbiter edges closer to DT giant ball of heat and radiation , its panels — sticking out either side of DT spacecraft , bringing PRP to 18.9 m across — will need to tilt away from DT sun , limiting DT amount of light PRP take in to ensure PRP do not overheat .

He did n’t believe IN Americans had landed on DT moon . In his estimation such a technological feat was simply not possible . Caught up in DT excitement of Apollo 11 DT summer , I MD not understand my grandfather ’s denial . In his insular NN , NN came grudgingly , however , and a moon landing was certainly a major NN . At DT NN of his death , in 1984 , Jeff Launius remained unconvinced . NNP Bill NNP recalled in his 2004 autobiography a similar story of a carpenter he worked with in August 1969 , not long after DT Apollo 11 landing : “ DT old carpenter asked me if I really believed PRP happened . I VBD sure , I saw PRP on television . He disagreed ; he VBD IN he did n’t believe PRP for a minute , IN “ them television fellers ” MD make things look real WDT were n’t . ” NNP York Times NN reporter John Noble Wilford remarked in December 1969 IN “ a few stool - warmers in Chicago bars are on record as suggesting IN DT Apollo 11 moon walk last July was actually staged by Hollywood on a Nevada desert . ” DT Atlanta Constitution led a story on June 15 , 1970 , with “ JJ skeptics feel moon explorer Neil Armstrong took his ‘ giant step for mankind ’ somewhere in Arizona . ” While poll numbers questioning DT moon landing in Detroit , Miami and Akron averaged less than 5 percent , among African - Americans in such places as Washington , D.C. , a whopping 54 percent doubted DT moon voyages . DT perhaps VBD more about DT disconnectedness of minority communities from DT Apollo effort and DT nation ’s overarching racism than anything else . As DT story reported , “ A woman in Macon VBD she knows she MD n’t watch a telecast from DT moon because her set MD n’t even pick up NNP York stations . ” As historian Howard McCurdy opined , “ To some , DT thrill of space ca n’t hold a candle to DT thrill of NN . ” An early and persistent theme has been IN as a Cold War measure DT NNP NNPS MD not afford to lose DT race to DT moon , but when failure loomed , NASA faked DT landing to save face and national prestige . PRP used DT massive funds dedicated to DT effort to “ pay off ” those who might be persuaded to tell DT truth ; PRP RB used threats and in some instances criminal actions to stop those who might blow DT whistle . Another common assertion has been IN in DT latter 1960s , with DT U.S. NN in disarray because of DT debacle of DT Vietnam War , DT racial crisis in DT cities , and social upheaval , DT Apollo program proved an ideal , positive distraction from this strife , a convenient NN designed to obscure other issues . CD story published in 1970 stated this belief as expressed by an African - American preacher : “ PRP ’s all a deliberate effort to mask problems at home , ” Newsweek quoted him saying . “ DT NNS are unhappy — and this takes their minds off their problems . ” DT first NN theorist to make a sustained case for denying IN DT U.S. landed on DT moon was Bill Kaysing , a journalist who had been employed for a few NNS in DT JJ relations office at Rocketdyne , Inc. , a NASA contractor , in DT early 1960s . His 1974 pamphlet PRP Never Went to DT Moon laid out JJ of DT major arguments WDT have been followed by other NN theorists since . His rationale offered poorly developed logic , sloppily analyzed data and sophomorically argued assertions . Kaysing believed IN a failure to land on DT moon sprang from DT idea IN NASA lacked DT technical expertise to accomplish DT task , requiring DT creation of a massive cover - up to hide DT fact . He cited as evidence perceived optical anomalies in some imagery from DT Apollo program , questioned DT physical features of certain objects in DT photographs ( such as a lack of a star field in DT background of lunar surface imagery and a presumed waving of DT U.S. flag in an airless environment ) , and challenged DT possibility of NASA astronauts ’ surviving a trip to DT moon because of radiation exposure . As John Schwartz wrote of DT NN theorists in DT NNP York Times , “ PRP examine photos from DT missions for signs of studio fakery , and claim to be able to tell IN DT American flag was waving in what was supposed to be DT vacuum of space . PRP overstate DT NN risks of traveling through DT radiation belts WDT girdle our NN ; PRP understate DT technological prowess of DT American space program ; and PRP cry murder behind every death in DT program , linking them to an overall NN . ” Ted Goertzel , a professor of sociology at Rutgers University who has studied NN theorists , told Schwartz IN “ EX ’s a similar kind of logic behind all of these groups . ” For DT most part , he explained , “ PRP do n’t undertake to prove IN their view is true ” so much as to “ find flaws in what DT other side is saying . ” And so , he VBD , argument is a matter of accumulation instead of persuasion . “ PRP feel if PRP ’ve got more facts than DT other side , DT proves PRP ’re right . ” Kaysing insisted , without any evidence whatsoever , IN even though DT Soviet Union was watching DT American effort closely , PRP was easier to successfully fake PRP than actually to land on DT moon . He even speculated IN DT chance of landing successfully on DT moon stood at 0.017 ; on what this calculation was based is a mystery and does not square with NASA estimates at DT NN , which stood at approximately 87 percent for at least CD successful landing before DT end of DT 1960s . Some moon - landing deniers concede IN EX were robotic missions to DT moon , but IN DT human Apollo landings were faked . Professional moon - landing denier Bart Sibrel has asserted IN Apollo spacecraft crews had faked their orbit around DT moon and their walk on its surface by using trick photography , but did accept NNP orbital missions . Humans MD not VB to DT moon , Sibrel and deniers of his ilk claim , because VBG beyond DT Van Allen radiation belts MD have given them lethal doses of cosmic radiation . While EX is indeed radiation both in DT Van Allen belts and beyond , and radiation ’s risks to human NN are real , contentions WDT PRP MD not be survivable are nonsense , and almost no papers in peer - reviewed scientific journals make this claim . A few NN theorists in this category even allow IN NASA landed robotically on DT moon various passive reflector mirrors used for laser ranging and other human - made objects to bamboozle DT NN . Then , EX are those who believe IN humans went to DT moon , but did so with DT assistance of extraterrestrial visitors — or IN Apollo astronauts discovered extra-terrestrial life RB . These claims ranged from gravitational anomalies to alien artifacts to alien encounters . Accordingly , this brand of NN theorist claims IN NASA covered up what had been found , in DT manner of DT discovery of a monolith at Clavius Crater on DT Moon in 2001 : A Space Odyssey . NN theorist Richard Hoagland has asserted for JJ NNS IN DT Apollo program discovered large artificial glass structures on DT lunar surface WDT has been kept from DT NN . Besides other conventions common in a cover - up , Hoagland made DT claim IN DT astronauts WDT went to DT moon had been hypnotized and any memories of extraterrestrial encounters were removed . Most interestingly , Hoagland has argued IN NASA deviously orchestrated DT origins of DT moon - landing denials as a disinformation campaign to mask DT discovery of extra-terrestrial structures on DT lunar surface . In 2009 , he asserted IN DT NN molecules WDT NASA ’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter had discovered on DT Moon had been leaked from buried extraterrestrial cities . No evidence supported these assertions . While DT various claims of DT moon - landing deniers have evolved over NN , their reasons for making these claims have rested on several types of “ evidence . ” DT most significant are anomalies found in photographs or , to a much lesser degree , movies taken on DT missions . Imagery has played a critical role in DT communication of DT experience . While Apollo imagery documented in graphic detail what took place on DT moon , DT use of DT same imagery to raise questions about DT entire enterprise is an irony too great to ignore . Some 25 images have been invoked in such claims . These include images WDT do not show stars in DT background , despite NN theorists ’ insistence IN PRP should be clearly seen ; DT fact IN dust was not present on DT landing pads of DT spacecraft ; DT assertion IN shadows and lighting on DT moon are uneven and counterintuitive to DT photographs in which PRP are seen ; IN flags seem to be blowing in a breeze although EX is no wind on DT moon ; IN some rocks appear to have propmaster marks on them ; and IN Réseau - plate crosshairs sometimes seem to disappear behind objects in an image . For each of these charges , EX are completely reasonable , understandable , and convincing explanations , most relating to DT nature of photography and DT vicissitudes of shadows , lighting and exposure of film in a vacuum . Few moon - landing deniers , however , will accept any explanation whatsoever . I have personally had CD say to me , “ Regardless of whatever PRP might say , I will never believe IN humans have landed on DT moon . ” Deniers of DT moon landing RB point to anomalies in DT historical record to cast doubt on DT NASA account of DT Apollo program . CD of DT persistent beliefs is IN DT “ blueprints ” for DT Apollo spacecraft and Saturn V rocket have been lost , or perhaps PRP never existed . This is simply untrue . DT National Archives and Records Administration maintains a regional Federal Records Center at Ellenwood , Georgia , just outside of Atlanta , where DT records from DT Marshall Space Flight Center are housed . Those records include more than 2,900 linear feet of Saturn V records , including drawings and schematics . A similar story about DT loss of DT original broadcast video from DT Apollo 11 landing has been used to cast doubt on DT whole endeavor , causing NASA to undertake an unprecedented search for DT tapes , finding some but not all WDT were missing . Finally , in this same category of anomalies in DT historical record , NN theorists have scrutinized every word uttered by DT Apollo astronauts over DT NNS to try to catch them in some statement WDT might be interpreted as denying DT landings . Having found none , some have resorted to selectively excerpting them and in some NNS to making them up altogether . Bart Sibrel commented , “ Neil Armstrong , DT first man to supposedly walk on DT moon , refuses to give interviews to anyone on DT subject . ‘ Ask me no questions , and I ’ll tell PRP no lies . ’ Collins RB refuses to be interviewed . Aldrin , who granted an interview , threatened to sue PRP if PRP showed PRP to anyone . ” Sibrel ’s implication is DT astronauts have something to hide . Sibrel has gone further , accosting astronauts and demanding IN PRP swear on DT Bible WDT PRP walked on DT moon . Some have done so ; others refuse to engage him . In CD incident on September 9 , 2002 , Sibrel confronted Buzz Aldrin at a Los Angeles hotel and called him a “ liar , a thief , and a coward . ” At DT point Aldrin , then 72 NNS old , hit Sibrel with a right hook WDT sent him to his knees . While Sibrel pressed charges , DT Los Angeles County District Attorney ’s office declined to pursue DT incident . Most NNS who viewed video of this altercation expressed concern IN Aldrin might have hurt his hand . In a truly bizarre turn of events , on August 31 , 2009 , near DT 40th anniversary of DT first moon landing , DT satirical publication DT Onion published a story entitled “ NNP Theorist Convinces Neil Armstrong Moon Landing Was Faked . ” DT story had worldwide implications , as PRP was published as true in several newspapers . Two Bangladeshi newspapers , DT Daily Manab Zamin and NNP Nation , apologized afterward for reporting PRP as fact . PRP is bad enough when NN theorists VBP such things without foundation ; these then VBP picked up and broadcast by individuals , but when legitimate NN organizations do so PRP is much more disturbing . As CD commentator about this incident suggested , “ Their excuse : ‘ PRP thought PRP was true so PRP printed PRP without checking . ’ ” Throughout DT latter third of DT 20th century and into DT 21st , with JJ confidence in DT U.S. NN declining because of Vietnam , Watergate and other scandals and malfeasance , PRP became somewhat easier for NNS to believe DT worst . EX has been considerable research on DT parts of society WDT embrace NN theories of all types . Arguing IN conspiracism writ large represents a fundamental part of DT political system , legal scholar Mark Fenster argues IN at sum , denials of DT moon landings bring to DT fore “ a polarization so profound IN NNS end up with an unshakable belief IN those in power ‘ simply ca n’t be trusted . ’ ” During a fall 2009 trip to Vladivostok , Russia , I gave four presentations about DT moon landings to university students . In every case , DT first question from DT students was about challenges to DT moon - landing account made by NN theorists . All of them channeled DT standard criticisms of Apollo made by denialists over DT NNS . A radio talk show host , Rob McConnell , declared IN listeners to his show DT X Zone , offered astounding responses to two questions — “ Do PRP believe in ghosts , and did American astronauts really walk on DT Moon ? ” — 77 percent of respondents VBD yes to belief in ghosts , and 93 percent VBD IN PRP did not believe IN DT Moon landings had actually occurred . As Seth Shostak from DT SETI Institute remarked about this , “ DT respondents believe in ghosts , but do not VB NASA put NNS on DT moon . On DT CD hand , PRP have uncorroborated testimony about noises in DT attic . On DT other , PRP have a decade of effort by tens of thousands of engineers and NNS , endless rocket hardware , thousands of photos , and 378 kilograms ( 840 pounds ) of moon rock . ” Shostak was befuddled by this reality of modern American society . Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt was more philosophical . “ If NNS decide PRP ’re VBG to deny DT facts of history and DT facts of NN and technology , ” he VBD , “ EX ’s not much PRP can do with them . For most of them , I just feel sorry IN PRP failed in their education . ” EX can be no question IN DT February 2001 airing of DT Fox television special NNP Theory : Did PRP Land on DT Moon ? changed DT nature of DT debate . In this instance , a major network presented a NN scenario without any serious rebuttal WDT might have been offered . As USA Today reported : “ According to Fox and its respectfully interviewed “ experts ” — a constellation of ludicrously marginal and utterly uncredentialed ‘ investigative journalists ’ — DT U.S. grew so eager to defeat DT Soviets in DT intensely competitive 1960s space race WDT PRP faked all six Apollo missions WDT purportedly landed on DT moon . Instead of exploring DT lunar surface , DT American astronauts only tromped around a crude movie set WDT was created by DT plotters in DT legendary Area 51 of DT Nevada desert . ” While DT program claimed to “ let DT viewer decide ” about DT validity of DT claims for denial of DT moon landings , PRP made no attempt whatsoever to offer point and counterpoint , thereby giving DT viewers a seriously biased view of DT issue and skewed evidence in favor of a hoax . DT most egregious violation of propriety came in DT Fox show when NN theorists claimed IN ten astronauts and two civilians had died “ under mysterious circumstances ” during DT Apollo program . DT ten astronauts in question included DT three who were killed in DT Apollo 1 fire of January 27 , 1967 , when their capsule was consumed in a flash fire during ground tests . At CD point , Scott Grissom , son of Apollo 1 mission commander Gus Grissom , who was killed in DT incident , claimed , “ My father ’s death was no accident . He was murdered . ” At another point , however , he retracted DT statement and declared IN “ NASA did n’t murder anyone . ” No question , shoddy workmanship and poor procedures led to those astronauts ’ deaths , and PRP was a tragic loss . But DT deaths of Grissom , Ed White and Roger Chaffee were an accident and not murder . Some moon - landing deniers have claimed IN NASA had them killed because Grissom was on DT verge of exposing DT Apollo program as a fraud . EX is not CD scintilla of evidence to support this accusation . DT identity of DT remaining seven astronauts presumably “ murdered ” by NASA during Apollo is something of a mystery . To be sure , astronaut Ed Givens died in an automobile accident , and astronauts Ted Freeman , C. C. Williams , Elliot See and Charlie Bassett died in aircraft accidents , but these were far removed from DT conduct of Project Apollo . This accounts for eight astronauts , but those making this claim RB apparently count as astronauts two other pilots who had nothing to do with DT moon - landing program , X - 15 pilot Mike Adams and Air Force Manned Orbiting Laboratory pilot Robert Lawrence . Finally , PRP claimed IN NASA technician Thomas Baron and another NASA civilian , who was unnamed , were murdered to keep DT secret of DT moon hoax . None of these claims was founded on any credible evidence . DT Fox program fueled an explosion in NN theories about DT Moon landings and DT audience for them . I was inundated with questions from friends and acquaintances — JJ of whom I thought were smarter than DT — asking me to explain why DT photos showed no stars and why DT flag moved . PRP got to be tiring , and unfortunately PRP changed my opinion IN most NNS are n’t so easily duped . PRP are . Two NNS who have argued against DT value of human spaceflight even came forward to counter DT Fox special ’s charges . Robert Park , director of DT Washington office of DT American Physical Society , dismissed DT “ documentary ” with this statement : “ DT body of physical evidence WDT humans did walk on DT Moon is simply overwhelming . ” Marc Norman at DT University of Tasmania added , “ Fox should stick to making cartoons . I ’m a big fan of ‘ DT Simpsons ’ ! ” As folklorist Linda Degh noted , “ DT mass NN catapult these half - truths into a kind of twilight zone where NNS can make their guesses sound as truths . Mass NN have a terrible impact on NNS who lack guidance . ” Without a proper rebuttal available from NASA — DT agency had an official position before of not responding to what PRP considered absurd claims — JJ young NNS publicly began to question DT Apollo landings . Several astronauts stepped forward to affirm DT legitimacy of DT program , but others thought DT charges too silly even to warrant response . JJ debated DT issues in DT emerging NN of DT Internet . Indeed , DT internet became a haven for NN theorists of all stripes , and with DT barrier for publication online so low anyone MD put up any page PRP wished with any assertions PRP wished to make . A search of DT term “ moon hoax ” recently yielded no fewer than 6,000 sites . NASA had refrained from officially responding to these charges — avoiding anything WDT might dignify DT claims — DT Fox show required IN PRP VB its approach . After DT Fox program first aired , NASA released a CD - paragraph press release titled , “ Apollo : Yes , PRP Did . ” “ Excerpted from Apollo ’s Legacy : Perspectives on DT Moon Landings by Roger D. Launius and published by Smithsonian Books ."

"" When I consider DT momentum PRP have here in Bonn and see how DT German NGO community , which is normally pretty critical of DT UN , is getting excited , I feel a little flicker of hope , "" he VBD . "" PRP have JJ problems and PRP have to find solutions in a JJ context and then put them into practice on DT local and regional level . "" Some have been critical of DT number of conferences WDT are held on development and DT environment , saying PRP has led to a sort of meeting fatigue .

These rival universe shapes anchor DT two sides of DT current debate . DT rival solutions are DT two “ classical ” expansion histories WDT a universe can have . Following an initial spurt of cosmic inflation from size zero , these universes steadily expand according to Einstein ’s theory of gravity and space - NN . Weirder expansion histories , IN football - shaped universes or caterpillar - JJ ones , mostly cancel out in DT quantum calculation . CD of DT two classical solutions resembles our universe . On large scales , PRP ’s smooth and randomly dappled with NN , due to quantum fluctuations during inflation . As in DT real universe , density differences between regions form a bell curve around zero . If this possible solution does indeed dominate DT wave function for minisuperspace , PRP becomes plausible to imagine IN a far more detailed and exact version of DT no-boundary wave function might serve as a viable cosmological model of DT real universe . DT other potentially dominant universe shape is nothing IN reality . As PRP widens , DT NN infusing PRP varies more and more extremely , creating enormous density differences from CD place to DT next IN gravity steadily worsens . Density variations form an inverted bell curve , where differences between regions approach not zero , but infinity . If this is DT dominant term in DT no-boundary wave function for minisuperspace , then DT Hartle - Hawking proposal MD seem to be wrong . DT two dominant expansion histories present a choice in how DT path integral should be done . If DT dominant histories are two locations on a map , megacities in DT realm of all possible quantum mechanical universes , DT question is which path PRP should take through DT terrain . Which dominant expansion history , and EX can only be CD , should our “ contour of integration ” pick up ? Researchers have forked down different paths . In their 2017 paper , Turok , Feldbrugge and Lehners took a path through DT garden of possible expansion histories WDT led to DT second dominant solution . In their view , DT only sensible contour is CD WDT scans through real values ( as opposed to imaginary values , which involve DT square roots of negative numbers ) for a variable called “ lapse . ” Lapse is essentially DT height of each possible shuttlecock universe — DT distance PRP takes to reach a certain diameter . Lacking a causal element , lapse is not quite our usual notion of NN . Yet Turok and colleagues argue partly on DT grounds of causality WDT only real values of lapse make physical sense . And summing over universes with real values of lapse leads to DT wildly fluctuating , physically nonsensical solution . “ NNS place huge faith in Stephen ’s intuition , ” Turok VBD by phone . “ For good reason — I mean , he probably had DT best intuition of anyone on these topics . But he was n’t always right . ” Jonathan Halliwell , a physicist at Imperial College London , has studied DT no-boundary proposal since he was Hawking ’s student in DT 1980s . He and Hartle analyzed DT issue of DT contour of integration in 1990 . In their view , as well as Hertog ’s , and apparently Hawking ’s , DT contour is not fundamental , but rather a mathematical tool WDT can be placed to greatest advantage . PRP ’s similar to how DT trajectory of a NN around DT sun can be expressed mathematically as a series of angles , as a series of times , or in terms of any of several other convenient parameters . “ PRP can do DT parameterization in JJ different ways , but none of them are any more physical than another NN , ” Halliwell VBD . He and his colleagues argue IN , in DT minisuperspace case , only contours WDT pick up DT good expansion history make sense . Quantum mechanics requires probabilities to add to 1 , or be “ normalizable , ” but DT wildly fluctuating universe WDT Turok ’s team landed on is not . DT solution is nonsensical , plagued by infinities and disallowed by quantum laws — obvious signs , according to no -boundary ’s defenders , to walk DT other way . PRP ’s true IN contours passing through DT good solution sum up possible universes with imaginary values for their lapse variables . But apart from Turok and company , few NNS VBP DT ’s a problem . Imaginary numbers pervade quantum mechanics . To team Hartle - Hawking , DT critics are invoking a false notion of causality in demanding DT lapse be real . “ DT ’s a principle which is not written in DT stars , and which PRP profoundly disagree with , ” Hertog VBD ."

I guess this is DT question PRP all VBP DT answer to , and indeed PRP should . Because inner-standing DT vastness and complexity to this Matrix construct and how PRP operates can only serve to shield and protect ourselves when PRP do inevitably reach DT point . What I am talking about in this blog is based upon NNS of research , PRP can take PRP or leave PRP . I am not attempting to force this upon NNS merely putting out DT of which deeply resonates as truth . DT fact is humanity is involved in a soul harvesting trap , I have written about this extensively previously in other blogs . PRP has been sold to PRP through ancient indoctrination as simply ‘ reincarnation ’ a method whereby PRP can come back and ‘ resolve ’ any outstanding karma on this NNP . This is a falsehood , PRP have been deceived and tricked and PRP has been VBG on for JJ JJ NNS . What is happening is IN PRP are being lured and tricked by DT false white light and deceivers acting as benevolent beings , who are essentially RB to just hook as back into coming back down for another dose on NNP crazy . Let me explain further . DT whole after death experience is nothing more than an AI simulation . As PRP die PRP will see a tunnel filled with white light , PRP MD feel immediately drawn to PRP as EX is a familiarity due to what PRP MD have read or heard about in your physical life . PRP must remember IN ignorance does n’t die when PRP die , thats why its so important to seek knowledge in your physical life , do your own research , and not be drawn into DT JJ traps and deceptions put out RB by DT Matrix agents in this dimension , those in NN , mainstream NN , and so on . So DT white light is DT first deception , once PRP enter DT white light PRP will be met with false white light beings . These beings MD masquerade as whatever PRP admired in your physical life , maybe some kind of deity , Jesus , Buddha or even a close family member . These beings VBP PRP intimately and VBP our blind spots and DT ways in which to appeal to our emotions . From RB PRP are taken for a life review whereby PRP are shown perhaps certain times in your life where PRP MD have hurt someone or made a mistake , PRP will play on your guilt and emotions once again , and RB deceive PRP into volunteering to come back down to NNP by promising IN PRP can come back to ‘ resolve our karma ’ . In reality all DT is happening is IN PRP are being sent back down to have our NN siphoned again for interdimensionals , entities , and parasitic NN agencies . PRP are DT food PRP need to feed on , and hence PRP need PRP back down on DT feeding ground . Most humans will volunteer quite easily , although most do n’t really VB to come back down . This is due to ignorance or fear of not ending up in some kind of ‘ heaven ’s PRP do n’t resolve their karma . Some human souls are so tired PRP VBP to a kind of resting area before PRP have their memories wiped and are sent back down into another human body . And so DT cycle begins again . So how can PRP escape this soul trap and where do PRP VB ? Well , first of all awareness is key , just even knowing IN this entrapment construct exists is empowering in and of itself . EX have been a few theories put forward about what to do and where to VB . DT murdered Max Spiers often spoke about VBG into your heart space . PRP is my inner-standing IN EX is a type of grid around this NNP , now this is n’t DT place to discuss whether DT NNP is flat or round lets put DT aside for CD second , although EX is no way I beLIEve NASA and DT photos WDT PRP put out ! This grid , or maybe even what is depicted as a dome in JJ films , is holding this Matrix construct together so NNS cannot leave and remain entrapped here . What has happened over DT last few decades however , is IN as NNS start to become more consciously aware and start to ‘ wake up ’ PRP is creating holes in this grid . Everything PRP see in terms of our own solar system is a holographic projection WITHIN this grid . Its not to say IN these Planets do n’t exist , its just IN PRP are within this Matrix grid . Outside DT grid PRP where DT REAL freedom and expansiveness of space lies , a place where PRP can travel instantly through thought alone , unlike here where PRP are bound by DT constructs of this artificial construct . As I talk about in my blog below , EX is a way out and PRP involves being strong willed when PRP leave your physical body . Clearly its not a good idea to VB to DT false white light , nor is PRP wise to stop and talk to any beings no matter how ‘ friendly ’ PRP might show themselves to be . DT idea is , by using thought ( as PRP wo n’t have your physical body anymore ) is to head for DT grid , and in particular CD of these holes WDT I spoke about previously . As DT NNP rises in consciousness I estimate IN EX will be more and more of these holes in DT grid . Bypass everything else and navigate your way through , do this without fear as PRP are always creating through our thoughts . As PRP navigate through DT same thing applies , use discernment when making decisions and interacting with any beings . Chances are EX will be JJ more benevolent forms of consciousnesses in DT realm than within DT grid but its still good practice to discern . From RB PRP ’re free to explore as your consciousness wants to .

Thousands more gathered at DT Cape Canaveral space centre yesterday , joyously counting down DT seconds until DT rocket sent a Tesla Roadster on a billion NN journey through space . But droves of skeptics and disbelievers immediately took to social NN platforms to voice their concerns and accuse SpaceX of faking DT whole operation . Flat Earthers , who are individuals who cling on to DT disproven theory IN DT NNP is a flat disk and not an oblate sphere , claimed DT stream was CGI . DT official Flat NNP Society Twitter page VBD today : “ NNS who believe IN DT NNP is a globe because ‘ PRP saw a car in space on DT Internet ’ must be DT JJ incarnation of ‘ PRP 's true , I saw PRP on TV ! ’ “ PRP 's a poor argument . Why MD PRP believe any privately - held company to report DT truth ? ” DT group further agued DT NN were in on SpaceX ’s agenda , helping out DT rocket manufacturer with DT alleged deception .

PRP 've never advocated for anything else . ” Another Twitter user under DT handle of Forever Flat , VBD : “ For all of PRP , who watched DT Falcon Heavy . Saw a car VB to space , saw NO satellites , NO ISS , NO space debris , NO oblate spheroid , NO spinning NNP , NO escape velocity , NO speeds of 20 kmph , NO stars , just stationary blackness . ” SpaceX founder Elon Musk , entertained DT Flat Earthers in a post - launch interview .

"" PRP ’s just literally a normal car in space , which I kind of VBP DT absurdity of DT . "" Those who watched DT SpaceX feed saw DT expensive electric car breathtakingly hang over DT blue NN below , immediately disproving conspiracies DT NNP is anything but a globe . From its vantage point thousands of kilometres above DT NNP , Mr Musk admitted watching DT Roadster and its dummy Starman pilot in real NN was a “ surreal ” experience . PRP can watch DT recorded SpaceX feed in full here : SpaceX Falcon Heavy launch live stream But not everyone was convinced by DT stream . JJ truthers questioned DT apparent lack of stars against vast expanse of space , while others pointed out DT NN appeared to be stationary . Twitter account Prof Brian Hoax tweeted : “ Surely , PRP do n't need to be a flat NNP believer to recognise DT fakery . “ Its not a flat NNP vs globe matter , its exposure of DT fraud and mockery . This affects PRP all . ” Unfortunately DT flat NN theory is supported by JJ prominent celebrities such as raper B.o.B. , cricketer Freddie Flintoff and NBA star Kyrie Irving . DT same NNS believe NASA and other respected scientific bodies are perpetuating DT “ globe hoax ” for their own ends . B.o. B challenged NASA last NN by pledging to send a satellite into space to settle DT debate . Thankfully DT argument has long been put to rest by DT countless hours of video footage , photos and astronaut trips to space ."

However , behind DT cartoonish style of DT video , viewers are exposed to a great deal of symbolism of DT occult elite and messages regarding its power . PRP ’ll look at DT symbolism of “ Dark Horse ” . Katy Perry is a gigantic pop star , mainly because her songs and videos appeal to teens and pre-teens while her sex - appeal captures DT attention of DT older crowd . This makes her a perfect tool to be used by DT elite to communicate its messages and , as seen in previous articles about her , her songs and videos are fully used for DT purpose . Dark Horse , however , is on a whole other level . PRP is pure , relentless , in - your - face Illuminati symbolism , interlaced with references to DT elite ’s brand of black magic and mind control . Playing DT role of “ Katy - Patra ” , an Egyptian pharaoh reminiscent of ancient sex symbol Cleopatra , Katy Perry rules over her subjects DT same way DT occult elite rules over DT NN . In my article on DT 2014 Grammy Awards , I described Katy Perry ’s performance of Dark Horse as a black magick ritual disguised as a music performance . DT video goes straight to DT roots of this sorcery : Egyptian Black Magick , DT original source WDT is tapped into by today ’s dark secret societies . Before PRP look at DT actual video , let ’s look at its trailer , which contains a few interesting elements . Then DT trailer VBZ IN Kings MD travel from “ Brooklyn to Babylon ” to meet her . Babylon , which was a real ancient metropolis located where Iraq is today , was ruled by various ancient empires and has long been an epicenter of DT elite ’s black magic . Let ’s look at DT video . Dark Horse takes place in a colorful , child - friendly version of Ancient Egypt WDT ’s been “ hip - hop- ized ” about 15 % to appeal to its target audience . Katy Perry plays DT role of an evil , greedy , egotistical , despotic pharaoh named Katy - Patra who destroys men for their belongings . What a great lesson for girls under DT age of 14 . In a wider sense , Katy - Patra ’s rule represents DT occult elite taking resources and power from nations ( represented by DT kings ) . What a great lesson for DT rest of DT NN . Throughout DT video , PRP is firmly established IN Katy - Patra is an evil tyrant using black magic to control and destroy NNS while having a bunch of kitten slaves at her feet . Kind of IN what DT occult elite does . And of course , EX are all kinds of blatant symbols WDT show her to be a representative of DT Illuminati . DT above scenes tell plenty about DT occult - elite influenced mythology of DT video . Katy - Patra is looked upon by Anubis , DT jackal - headed god of death , probably because she likes to kill NNS . Behind her is DT falcon - headed god Horus wearing gold chains ( to make him look “ cool ” to young , impressionable viewers ) . Notice IN he only has CD eye – a reference , once again , to DT All - Seeing Eye of Horus . More importantly , Katy - Patra is surrounded by a golden snake , which probably refers to DT evil Egyptian god Apep . Three 6 Mafia rapper Juicy J makes an appearance in DT video and his entrance is pretty darn symbolic too . He literally emerges from some kind sarcophagus , which features DT occult elite ’s favorite symbol in lieu of eyes : DT Eye of Horus inside a triangle . On top of all of DT symbolism , PRP must never forget another part of DT Agenda : Exposing young NNS to hyper - sexualization . DT video is essentially about kings from other nations trying to wow Katy - Patra with amazing gifts . DT first suitor offers her a gigantic diamond . Katy - Patra immediately orders her kitten slaves to snatch DT diamond from DT suitor . DT above image is symbolic for a few reasons : First , PRP tells DT viewers IN Katy - Patra plays DT role of DT occult elite in DT video . Second , she CANNOT see through DT Eye ( PRP is opaque ) . She instead sees DT diamond through DT elite ’s “ eyes ” , which are focused on greed , power , and material possessions . Finally , NNS who watch music videos need to be exposed to DT CD - eye sign all DT NN . I MD stop DT video analysis here . What else do PRP truly need to VB about DT video ? Katy Perry is looking at a big diamond using an Eye of Horus to hide CD eye . This scene is a 100 % continuation of about everything I ’ve ever talked about on this site . And EX PRP is again , right in our faces , in CD of DT NN ’s most popular videos . Really , how can anyone VB IN all this symbolism is “ just a coincidence ” ? Anyhow , back to DT video . DT next suitor tries to entice Katy - Patra ’s gluttony by offering her food . Of course , things do not turn out great for DT guy , either . DT last suitor brings what Katy - Patra really wants : Power . Seeing this pyramid , Katy - Patra gets very excited because DT ’s what she , and DT elite , truly wants : Unlimited occult power over DT NN . DT illuminated pyramid essentially represents DT Illuminati ’s high - tech control over DT NN . When Katy - Patra steps on top of DT unfinished pyramid , she becomes imbued with crazy magical powers . She even grows wings . DT video ends with Katy - Patra becoming a super - Illuminati pharaoh … and everyone bows down to her … and DT suitor turns into a chihuahua . DT moral of DT video ? Illuminati . PRP is rather hard to believe IN all of this Illuminati symbolism was packed into a video WDT only lasts 3 minutes and 40 seconds . PRP is even harder to believe IN some NNS still cannot see DT obvious pattern of symbols found in mass NN WDT transcends artists , music genres , and even NN outlets . Far from being random , these symbols have been used for centuries to represent DT occult elite and PRP are now all over DT place . More than just flashing symbols , DT video Dark Horse tells a darker story : DT occult elite ’s insatiable greed for ultimate power while dismissing DT petty rulers operating underneath PRP . Katy - Patra indeed takes resources from various kings of DT NN and then destroys them . In DT end , she climbs on an Illuminati pyramid and turns into an unstoppable pharaoh imbued with magical powers . MD DT brainwashing be more obvious ? In short , Dark Horse is Illuminati propaganda aimed at NNS , using bright colors and catchy hooks to subliminally teach them who rules DT NN and who controls DT idols WDT PRP love and emulate . Of course , none of this is clearly spelled out . Instead , PRP comes at PRP through symbolism … IN a dark horse ."

But not any more . DT hotel is hosting DT second annual Flat NNP International Conference – an event WDT Davidson himself founded and organized . “ I ’d first heard PRP in DT Bible and thought ‘ this ca n’t be true , ’ ” he recalled , speaking with rapid excitement . “ I mean , I believed everything else , IN DT NNP was created in six literal days , but what about all this other stuff [ about a flat NNP ] ? To be consistent as a biblical literalist , I ca n’t pick and choose . ” David ’s conversion to believing in a flat NN was only a few NNS ago , yet in DT NN he and scores of others around DT globe – including a few celebrities – have subscribed to DT idea IN DT NNP is shaped IN a pancake . DT theories splinter off from RB , with varying ideas about who is propagating misinformation about DT NNP ’s shape and why , but EX are a number of unifying touchstones : Nasa , Freemasons , DT “ faked ” moon landing , globalists , Elon Musk . But perhaps DT most common thread is DT Bible , and DT conviction of its fundamental truth . DT makes evangelical Christians CD of largest and most enthusiastic groups who embrace DT theory , but PRP are RB CD of DT least reported on and CD WDT causes immense controversy in their own community . Yet walking DT halls of DT conference – where 650 NNS from around DT NN paid up to $ 350 to attend lectures about their horizontal idea of DT NN – PRP ’s not uncommon to see NNS praying over CD another , discussing apocalyptic theories about “ end times ” , or swapping Bible verses WDT describe DT NNP in a non-spherical fashion . “ I ’ve found over 200 scriptures WDT corroborate DT idea IN PRP are living on a stationary , flat NNP , ” VBD Nathan Roberts , CD of JJ “ cosmological evangelists ” speaking at DT event . He ’s a handsome , young entrepreneur , traveling DT country with his wife and kids , speaking about Jesus and selling books about creationism – DT perfect model of an American evangelical . And yet most evangelicals , IN most NNS , despise DT work WDT he does on a flat NNP . “ DT most persecution I ’ve faced has been from within DT church , ” Roberts VBD . At a NN when evangelicals are facing somewhat of a JJ relations crisis–backlash against their LGBT stance , prosperity doctrines and overwhelming support of DT NNP 2016 campaign , observers say PRP makes sense PRP MD bristle at any associations with DT flat NNP movement . Throughout DT last century , evangelicals have had a love - hate relationship with fundamentalist Christians , who are an evangelical subculture who see DT Bible as a historical , scientifically factual account of NN events . Mainstream evangelicals tend to employ what ’s known as “ seeker sensitive ” tactics of neutral politics , live rock music and charming , hip pastors , attracting celebrities IN Chris Pratt , Justin Bieber and Kim Kardashian . Whereas fundamentalist Christians are typically less frills and more idealism , often leading to homeschooling , survivalist lifestyles , and a focus on DT Book of Revelation . Flat Earthers ( or “ biblical Earthers , ” as some distinguish themselves at this conference ) are a JJ subculture of American fundamentalist Christianity . PRP ’s a marriage of anti-government NN theories ( Nasa ’s space program is a complete lie ) with biblical literalism ( DT NNP is DT flat , center of DT universe , with heaven above DT sky and hell below DT ground ) . DT movement does claim a few celebrities . In 2007 DT View co-host and evangelical Christian Sherri Shepherd caused a collective gasp in DT early NN of social NN when she publicly questioned whether DT NNP was flat . Former MTV diva Tila Tequila , rapper B.o.B. , and Boston Celtics Kyrie Irving have all publicly identified as flat Earthers . At Thursday ’s conference , Davidson was giddy to announce DT unexpected appearance of DT YouTube personality Logan Paul ( whose channel has more than 18 million subscribers ) . Paul made a brief appearance on stage , where he announced he was “ coming out of DT flat NNP closet ” to a thunderous applause from DT crowd . Their increase in relevance is primarily due to social NN and an endlessly curious NN . DT Washington Post , for example , has run six separate articles about an amateur rocketeer attempting to kiss DT sky and video - record WDT DT NN is flat . But for DT most part , flat Earthers are CD of DT most mocked subcultures of our NN . PRP have inspired DT ire of Neil deGrasse Tyson , Modern Family and an evangelical scholar whose work PRP have cited as evidence for their theory . “ PRP ’ve taken my writing about ancient Israelite cosmology , interpreted PRP in this uber - literal way , and used PRP to prop up this flat NNP idea , ” VBD Michael Heiser , a biblical scholar from Liberty University and host of DT Naked Bible podcast , who has expressed his frustration with DT misinterpretation of his work by flat Earthers . IN most debates between scholars and fundamentalists , his gripe with flat Earthers comes down to whether DT Bible should be seen as an allegorical or literal text . “ In Genesis , PRP have an NNP WDT is round but flat , with a solid dome over PRP , ” says Heiser . “ In Proverbs , EX are references to DT seas being held in place where light meets darkness , which is DT horizon , where DT dome covers and seals DT NNP . PRP have references to DT NNP being set upon a foundation , known as DT pillars of DT NNP . PRP have waters beneath DT NNP , which is DT realm of DT dead . “ All of this is standard vocabulary for how NNS of this NN and place viewed DT NN . PRP did n’t VB about Antarctica or NNP Zealand . DT Bible is an ancient Mediterranean - centered document , written by NNS who are describing their NN through their experiences . DT mountains are described as holding DT dome of DT sky in place , but EX was no REI store nearby where PRP MD buy mountain climbing gear and scale these peaks to see what was VBG on . ” Heiser is a Christian himself , albeit CD who prefers to view DT Bible in its historical context . JJ NNS at DT conference , including Davidson , say PRP have been kicked out of churches , or lost jobs with churches , or suffered broken relationships with family members because PRP have gone JJ with their beliefs about a flat NNP . PRP see DT Denver conference as a rare opportunity to share a physical space with fellow believers . “ PRP ’s very cathartic being around other [ flat Earthers ] , ” VBD Davidson . “ PRP ’s so important , because PRP ’ve been isolated and abused , and now PRP can breathe , relate and connect with JJ - minded NNS … I ’d say only 20 % of flat Earthers are actually out of DT closet about this . What PRP see now is just DT first wave . EX ’s a bigger wave coming and PRP ’s gonna catch DT NN off guard . ”"

But Troetel , who is 32 and lives in Boulder , Colorado , is not particularly interested in DT Colts . Addai ’s performance is crucial to “ Addai in DT Life , ” Troetel ’s fantasy football team . Fantasy sports , where fans select real athletes for make - believe teams , are exploding onto JJ platforms IN smart phones and social networking sites , grabbing DT attention of advertisers , wireless carriers and software companies . And with a growing number of NNS playing casual games on DT Internet and a largely untapped market outside DT NNP NNPS , analysts say DT market for fantasy sports can only grow . Among companies benefiting from this growth is 4 I nfo , which alerts its users to things IN sports scores and celebrity gossip via text message , with its revenue coming from advertisers . Of DT half a billion text messages WDT 4 I n fo expects to send this NN , as JJ as 15 percent will be to NNS seeking sports results to feed into their fantasy sports teams , VBD CEO Zaw Thet . “ NNS have yet to realize DT full potential of fantasy as PRP really comes to DT cell phone and PRP ’ll see IN over DT course of DT next several NNS , ” VBD Thet , whose company is backed by Gannett Co , General Electric Co ’s NBC Universal and venture capital firms . While EX is disagreement on DT origin of fantasy sports , PRP came to wide attention with DT publication of “ Rotisserie League Baseball ” in 1984 , based on a league played by a group of NNP York NN types and rules by magazine writer Daniel Okrent . DT appeal of fantasy leagues to sports fanatics is often cited as a factor in DT early success of USA Today , which was launched in 1982 with more detailed baseball statistics than other newspapers . “ PRP ’s IN PRP ’ve combined DT old macho notion of knowing more than anybody about sports with Dungeons and Dragons , ” VBD Robert Thompson , professor of pop culture at Syracuse University . “ PRP turns out DT ’s a pretty good marriage . ” Troetel , for example , checks on his players at least two or three times a week , using his handheld device to VB to DT relevant websites . “ DT way I VBP sports now is far and away greater than if I did n’t play fantasy sports , ” he VBD . Fantasy sports took an exponential leap in DT late 1990s as DT Internet made sports results more widely available and sites IN Yahoo Inc began to host fantasy sports leagues for a fee . EX are now more than 27 million players in DT NNP NNPS and annual revenue is in DT range of $ 800 million to $ 1 billion , according to DT Fantasy Sports Trade Association . Fans already use their mobile phones to read sports NN , review game scores and check on their teams . Wireless carriers are now working to align themselves exclusively with whatever sports properties PRP can as a way to make themselves more attractive to consumers . “ If PRP ’re DT only NN who offers what NNS VBP , PRP ’re VBG to find a way to switch to your service , ” VBD Steve Gaffney , director of sports and entertainment marketing for Sprint Nextel Corp , which has deals with DT National Football League and DT National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing ( NASCAR ) . While small screens are not RB attractive to advertisers , smart phones IN Research in Motion ’s Blackberry and Apple ’s iPhone WDT offer live streaming video and other multimedia features is undeniable , VBD Bob Bowman , chief executive of Major League Baseball ’s advanced NN unit . Another growth area is social networking sites IN Facebook , which is hosting a fantasy football game with 350,000 users since PRP started in July , making PRP CD of DT larger fantasy football games on DT Internet . “ Fantasy sports at its core is a set of microcommunities of your good friends WDT PRP VBP to stay in touch with and ‘ talk smack ’ to , and Facebook allows NNS to do DT , ” VBD Jeff Ma , co-founder of Citizen Sports Network , which runs DT Facebook game in partnership with NNP Warner ’s Sports Illustrated . Ma , whose San Francisco - based firm is backed by venture capitalists Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers , is DT basis for DT main character in DT book “ Bringing Down DT House ” and DT movie “ 21 , ” in which a group of students used math to win millions of dollars from casinos . Another big growth area for fantasy sports is among so - called casual gamers , those whose interest is limited or who MD not have a lot of free NN to play . ESPN , a unit of Walt Disney Co , in late August introduced a game where users try to select winners and top performers in an effort to be first to build a 25 - pick winning streak over four months WDT MD net a $ 1 million prize . “ PRP ’s our strategy to develop games WDT are very easy to play , ” VBD Raphael Poplock , vice NN of games for ESPN Digital NN . These casual players MD help almost double DT number of fantasy sports players to 50 million over DT next five NNS , VBD Chris Russo , CEO of Fantasy Sports Ventures , a NN company focused on fantasy sports . Other companies taking advantage of DT growth in fantasy sports include Google ’s YouTube , Electronic Arts and advertisers IN Gillette and Coke . “ DT sheer participation numbers are so overwhelming , ” VBD Andrew Bangs , a community marketing specialist with YouTube , which launched a fantasy football channel in July . DT growth in fantasy sports is RB feeding back into DT real sports leagues , where fantasy sports fans spend more NN engaged with real teams than fans who do n’t play fantasy sports . “ Nearly 60 percent of revenue comes from fans attending games , so to DT extent I can VB a casual fan to VB to CD game WDT means a lot , ” baseball ’s Bowman VBD . “ If I can repeat DT 10 million times , DT ’s real money . ” Overseas markets offer another enticing opportunity , as games around cricket , soccer , rugby and other sports are not as developed as those in DT NNP NNPS , VBD Steve Byrd , executive vice NN with Stats Inc , which licenses sports content and statistics for almost 90 different sports leagues . “ PRP VBP DT growing middle class in NNP and India , with Internet access , PRP ’re VBG to VB to engage with their sports DT way WDT PRP do , ” he VBD . In addition , industry executives VBD DT number of fantasy websites is exploding . DT expansion will only speed up since DT U.S. Supreme Court in June declined to hear DT appeal by Major League Baseball of a lower - court ruling IN any company has DT free - speech right to use DT names and performance statistics of famous athletes . Of course with so JJ companies out RB , EX is bound to be a shakeout . “ CD out of every 10 sites makes PRP , ” VBD Rick Wolf , chairman of DT Fantasy Sports Association . “ For DT small companies , PRP ’s very hard to succeed . ” Not everyone is in favor of fantasy sports . “ I am DT flat - NN society on this NN , ” VBD Dave Zirin , sports writer for DT Nation , a left - wing magazine . “ PRP ’s a very atomizing experience to live in DT NNP NNPS at times and so sports is CD of those few ways where PRP ’re able to VB a sense of collective joy . Fantasy sports runs counter to DT . ” Allison Lodish just wants her husband back . She launched Women Against Fantasy Sports ( http://womenagainstfantasysports.com) in August as a forum for frustrated spouses . DT site ’s top - selling item is women ’s underwear with DT slogan : “ Closed for DT fantasy season . ”"

But why are waves on DT West Coast bigger than those on DT East Coast ? EX are three primary factors WDT determine a wave 's height : According to DT Encyclopedia of DT NNP , a wave is "" DT oscillations of DT NN caused by DT wind blowing along DT surface and moving in DT direction in which DT wind blows . "" DT important thing to remember about waves is IN DT NN is n't moving -- DT NN from DT wind is moving through DT NN . On DT West Coast , DT prevailing winds are behind DT waves , which increases DT waves ' NN . On DT East Coast , DT prevailing winds blow against DT incoming waves , decreasing DT waves ' NN . ­ ­On each coast of DT NNP NNPS is a continental shelf . To understand DT continental shelf , let 's imagine IN DT ocean dried up . DT land under DT NN looks a bit IN DT Grand Canyon , with cliffs and valleys , plateaus and ridges . On DT West Coast , if PRP walked out onto DT continental shelf , PRP MD notice IN DT shelf ( DT area between DT beach and where DT drop - off begins ) is narrower . This means IN if PRP have less sand to walk on before DT ocean 's floor drops off steeply , IN a cliff . On DT East Coast , DT shelf is broader -- EX is more sand to walk on as DT shelf drops gradually , IN a really long ramp . Underneath DT surface of DT NN , particles are spinning in DT direction WDT DT wind is moving in . DT particles are largest at DT surface of DT NN . DT deeper PRP VBP in DT NN , DT smaller DT spinning particles . As DT wave moves inland and hits DT upward slope of DT continental shelf on DT East Coast , DT friction causes DT particles to slow down , so DT wave gradually collapses on itself . On DT West Coast , DT shelf rises suddenly near DT coast , so DT waves are much larger when PRP crash into DT coastline -- DT particles ( and thus DT wave ) have n't been slowed down by extended friction with DT shelf . DT Pacific Ocean on DT West Coast has a greater expanse than DT Atlantic Ocean on DT East Coast . This means IN DT fetch ( DT distance over which DT wind blows ) is greater on DT West Coast than on DT East Coast . In this case , PRP can VB of wave as a snowball : DT farther PRP roll your snowball along in DT snow , DT bigger PRP gets . West - coast waves tend to start way out in DT Pacific Ocean , so PRP have a greater distance to travel before PRP hit DT shore -- more NN to grow in size and length . Dr. Ernie Knowles , associate professor of oceanography at NC NNP University , can help PRP put all of this together : "" DT steep shelf on DT West Coast MD cause a more abrupt buildup of DT shoaling wave ( so waves MD be ' steeper ' when PRP break ) . But DT much longer fetch in DT Pacific Ocean allows DT waves to receive more wind NN , and so PRP grow larger . DT swell arriving on DT West Coast has periods in DT range of 10 to 17 seconds ( quite long waves ) , while DT East Coast swell is more in DT six - to 10 - second range .

At DT NN , Flintoff insisted EX was “ evidence to suggest DT NN is n’t round ” .

"" RB if PRP fire a laser about 16 miles , if DT NN was curved , PRP should n’t be able to see PRP but PRP can . ” But once again he admitted he does not believe NNP is totally flat , instead claiming PRP was “ bulbous , IN a turnip ” .

"" This is why all governments now have bases on DT South Pole . ” Other sporting stars who believe DT NN is not round include NBA star Kyrie Irving and wrestler AJ Styles .

PRP are highly advanced in technology , and call DT main ship , DT Mother Ship – “ Mama ” . PRP call NNP “ Mother ” . DT Mother ship allowed itself to be attacked by DT “ reptilians ” , in order to trigger a “ coming together in unity ” of DT various other galactics : Arcturians were first , then others . PRP were trained to help with DT rebuilding , as a pretext to creating a common goal : uniting against DT “ evil enemy ” , and assisting NN ’s peoples . DT story is a metaphor for Christ , having “ laid down his life ” for our sins . Sacrifice . DT Mother Ship allowed herself to be attacked by DT reptilians , with a larger plan of bringing together other galactics into unity . DT Sirians decide PRP cannot contact PRP directly , as PRP MD be “ too disturbing ” . So , DT Mother ship is building , in her “ storage hold ” , at DT bottom , a JJ “ baby ship ” , while a team effort is made to repair her body , atom by atom . PRP will be DT focus of all DT different galactic groups , who are / will be attempting to communicate with PRP via holographic technologies . She is calling forth an etheric partner , to mate with , and DT little ship in her womb is VBG to literally “ be birthed ” . Where have PRP heard this story before ?! Over and over and over …new clothes , same old broken record . Sirius B is allegedly DT Dogon tribe and is called Satais : Satan ? Saturn ? And Sirius C has “ penis envy problems ” , since PRP ’s so “ tiny ” , and insignificant . Name ? ANU . PRP can figure out DT rest . See DT Lessin ’s work on DT ANUnnaki . Giving them some credit , no race is good or bad . IN PRP , EX are wise ones and savage selfish ones , a “ mixed bag ” . DT problem with “ Ascended Masters ” in any guise , is complacency and a desire to rule over , not create with . In a fully ascended society or group , EX MD be no thought forms of killing , envy , using others , rape , wars , etc . Those are all from DT 9D underworld , DT Matrix , from which PRP are individually being guided to “ DT door ” out . PRP have become “ Creators ” at DT material - matter level , which is something DT “ advanced ones ” lack . PRP do not have DT comprehension , or DT necessary empathy and love for all things in creation , even a bug . PRP are so mired in technology IN PRP ’s IN another trap , similar to here , DT “ earthly maze ” . This is a place of unending illusions – nothing creating nothing real , PRP ’s all false . Only our truest emotions and higher NNS of consciousness are IN pearls , WDT VBP placed on a strand with a knot between each NN , “ in case ” DT strand ( DNA ) breaks . Ours has been heavily tampered with , yet here PRP are ! Eventually , Sirius A view their technology as a great gift to PRP . Hidden devices , behind our speakers , will “ create feelings at DT emotional level ” , thoroughly “ blissing PRP out ” , PRP will be in a kind of virtual dream NN WDT ’s forever peaceful . Question : where are all DT living things …trees , wind , NN , fire , NN , oceans , etc . ? PRP are not RB . What happened to Gaia - Sophia ? Not RB . PRP appears to be yet another carrot , being dangled , to subdue “ DT monstrous humans ” , DT cannot even be dealt with in person , PRP are so savage . EX is no mention of Pleiadian or other involvement , so this is a serious Sirius A problem ! EX is always a “ bad guy ” … those evil … “ x , y’s and z’x ” , be PRP this , DT or another . Lucifer and Satan are very popular , reptilians are out , Archons in , A.I. is here now , and DT demigods … those pesky interlopers . I vaguely remember Sirius A and B both ascended , and C did n’t make PRP , and is “ NNP X ” , feeding off of NN ’s NN , mostly on our human divinity being kept repressed . Religions collapse when PRP step up to DT plate ! Politics , corporations , NNS , all collapse , IN a wave collapsing into Zero Point , so PRP all have a lot invested in keeping PRP ignorant and savage . DT plan showed in this video is a clear message about “ overwriting ” CD of DT Creators , perhaps DT head honcho , WDT created our multi-verse . Perhaps , “ PRP ” is NNP . As long as PRP ’re fragmented , and not in CD piece , or unified , which is DT idea here , our “ powers ” remain hidden within , until PRP VBP within to find our own truths , while knowing IN DT projection “ out RB ” is Maya , illusion . PRP can only create more of itself , more illusions … PRP ’s quite possible IN “ ascension ” is not UH a ladder VBG up , a la Jacob , but is an inner descent through DT 9D Underworlds , where PRP are now at 3D , VBG into 2D ( Telluric / crystalline ) , 1D ( Core / Heart ) , to be birthed in ZERO POINT or “ no NN ” , Graduation ! DT is DT process of i n c e n s i o n , which has nothing to do with DT fake hologram PRP ’re obsessed with . DT is DT “ earthly maze ” . PRP ’s collapsing as PRP speak … “ flat NN NNS ” , DT “ sun is a “ microchip ” WDT ’s VBG to stop working , thrusting our universe into a short period of blissful darkness , not light . Those who panic , unable to VB “ centered ” , will find DT location quite difficult to navigate . PRP requires DT ability to endure silence , and who today can stand more than half an hour of complete silence ? PRP ’re constantly busy busy busy , with CD flashing glint of “ fool ’s gold ” after another ! Meher Baba drew a circle within a circle , representing DT “ Original Real Everything ” and a smaller dotted circle , “ Original Real Nothing ” . Dotted lines come out of DT shadow , ( nothing ) , to create DT “ False Everything ” , with its “ innumerable nothings ” . This is a false creation , which will continue to create more of itself , until PRP wake up , snap out of PRP , and “ grok ” IN PRP are part of DT Original Real Everything . DT “ shadow ” dissolves , or becomes smaller , as PRP each awaken to our own inner truths , and VBP IN PRP are “ Gods in our own universe ” . Our power is being milked and diverted , by DT “ False Everything ” . PRP will do anything to remain unseen , Unconscious and pulling DT strings , IN a Puppet Master . IN DT film , DT Truman Show , his is a metaphor for our own sticky wicket here . DT ’s a lower – bottom of DT fish bowl frequency , of scum . PRP can not make PRP through any shifts , created authentically . PRP ’d be in another cycle of incarnation , only PRP MD do away with DT “ death ” , to some human ’s glee , until DT “ perfect NN ” became TOO perfect . Boredom sets in , then PRP have “ disaster groupies ” , who travel into DT past , to watch NN ’s and other NN ’s , huge disasters . DT film , Disaster in NNP [ aka Timescape ( 1992 ) ] foreshadows this beautifully , and PRP ’s CD of my favorite films . I VBP PRP need to educate these “ higher beings ” , and let them VB PRP MD have DT best of intentions , most likely not , and IN PRP are capable of communing and creation from our own thoughts , being creators with amnesia . I prefer not to remain in a coma , but MD rather WAKE UP , be responsible for my creations , and enjoy DT harmony of friends who resonate , have chosen a path of peace , love , joy and fun ! Where is DT humor ? DT “ humans ” seem to be floating around in a daze , just dreaming . Sorry , PRP ’s got some fatal flaws ! I have no intention of permitting nanotechnology , artificial “ mood enhancers all around me , beaming “ feel good bliss ” as PRP approach them , to be MY NN ! Still , EX are some great visuals and PRP offers a PERSPECTIVE , a point of view , but PRP ’s very controlled and highly suggestive and is loaded with “ propaganda ” . But , PRP ’re accustomed to having others VB for PRP , so PRP ’s a familiar place for most to be . Someone is VBG to save PRP …the running “ Savior Program ” , A.I . DT Architects try to remove LOVE from DT equation , and PRP continue to have to destroy their creations . PRP ca n’t survive without true love , felt by a “ heart space ” , DT Higher Emotional Center . When PRP is active , along with Higher Intellectual Center , PRP activates DT third part of DT equation , DT trinity within : non-dual , transcendent , infinite and eternal ."

Appearing online in a YouTube video posted on DT StarTalk channel , Mr Tyson vented his outrage and debunked DT Flat NNP myth . Unamused by his co-host Chuck Nice ’s question about DT shape of DT NNP , DT vexed scientist VBD : “ PRP have video from space of DT rotating , spherical NNP . DT NNP is round . ” DT Flat NNP Theory is an old and obviously debunked belief DT NN is not spherical , but rather a flat disk surround by a towering barrier of NN . Believers of DT bunkum theory , commonly referred to as Flat Earthers , claim to rely on their own senses and observations rather than empirical scientific data . JJ Flat Earthers have accused leading scientific bodies IN NASA of deceiving DT NN about NNP ’s shape . But Mr Tyson now expressed his confusion when faced with DT number of NNS who still subscribe to DT theory . DT physicist VBD : “ What is odd , is EX are NNS who VBP NNP is flat but recognise IN DT Moon is round , Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , Neptune and DT sun are all spheres . He then went on to explain why DT vast majority of stellar objects in DT observable universe are all round , and only occasionally appear to be flattened . According to Mr Tyson all DT known laws of physics and processes in space “ favour DT sphere ” . He VBD : “ And if something is not a sphere and is a little flattened , PRP can ask what flattened PRP , and PRP find out PRP ’s rotating real fast . “ So then PRP gets a little flattened because of DT . So almost everything in DT universe is either a sphere or light distortion of a sphere , for some other things happening to PRP . “ PRP can just see how DT universe favours spheres . ” But then why do so JJ NNS still believe DT NN is flat ? A lot of PRP comes down to DT fundamental problems with free speech , Mr Tyson argued . Mr Tyson blamed DT scores of NNS who truly believe DT NNP is flat and spout their false theories to others without consequence . DT physicist RB criticised DT American schooling system , saying PRP does not teach NNS to VB critically . He VBD : “ Our system needs to train PRP not only what to VB , but how to VB about information and knowledge and evidence . “ If PRP do n’t have DT kind of training PRP MD run around and believe anything . ” DT Flat NNP Society claims to encourage DT spread of ideas and free thought since at least 1865 ."

On Jan. 25th 2019 , Google owned - YouTube announced on its official blog IN PRP ’s VBG to stop recommending “ borderline content ” to its users and viewers – presumably because PRP deeply cares . Hmm-hmm . YouTube VBZ IN such content “ MD misinform users in harmful ways . ” JJ NNS have awoken to DT truth of DT NWO ( NNP NNP Order ) and JJ aspects of DT overarching NN by watching YouTube videos over DT NNS , including by letting YouTube guide them to JJ videos through its recommendation algorithm . Now DT free flow of information is about to stymied once again , and as with all things related to DT NWO Agenda , this will be another step of JJ to come , since Google serves DT Agenda . YouTube has yet to fully detail what PRP means by borderline content , although interestingly enough , PRP has divulged 3 examples of what PRP has in mind : “ PRP ’ll continue DT work this NN , including taking a closer look at how PRP can reduce DT spread of content WDT comes close to — but does n’t quite cross DT line of — violating our Community Guidelines . “ To DT end , PRP ’ll begin reducing recommendations of borderline content and content WDT MD misinform users in harmful ways — such as videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness , claiming DT NN is flat , or making blatantly false claims about historic events IN 9/11 . ” Whatever Google is VBG after is a barometer of what DT NWO manipulators most do n’t VB PRP to VB . Natural cures are a big threat to DT profits and monopoly of Big Pharma . PRP are RB threat to those at DT peak of DT control pyramid , because a fit , healthy and strong populace is far harder to control than a dependent , sick and weak NN . Of course , EX are JJ charlatans in DT natural NN NN ( just as in DT Western JJ NN ) who will exaggerate , lie and claim anything just to make a sale , so Google is using this as way to garner more support for its censorship efforts . This will have DT unfortunate effect of burying videos WDT truly teach natural cures to NN . EX are so JJ examples of budding , promising or proven natural cures to diseases WDT Big Pharma has tried to suppress . Just look at cancer alone – natural treatments such as vitamin B17 ( laetrile / amygdalin ) , Rife frequency machines , baking soda , DT Gerson Therapy , DT Budwig Diet , graviola and JJ more are all not sanctioned by NN authorities despite DT evidence supporting them . Far from protecting its users , YouTube is about to do more harm to by curbing DT free flow of information to prevent more NNS from seeing alternative cures and possibly trying them out , or at least having DT opportunity and freedom to make up their own minds . Is YouTube VBG to stop NNS knowing about DT power of medicinal cannabis ? Or C60 ? Organic fruit and vegetables ? Is PRP VBG to try to shut down discourse on DT true meaning of healing vs. managing NN ? NNS in DT alternative research community are still divided on DT issue of Flat NNP ( FE ) , although DT large majority believe PRP is either a psy - op or a delusion . Regardless of what turns out to be true , however , DT fact cannot be denied IN JJ Flat NNP videos are raising important questions WDT standard mainstream physics does n’t appear to have answers for . If PRP turns out IN all DT questions and doubt can be adequately answered and countered by DT existing heliocentric model , then good ; DT FE movement will have done heliocentrism a favor by challenging PRP and making PRP stronger . This is precisely why no advanced society need fear freedom of speech , asking questions , investigating topics or being curious . EX is no such thing as a dumb question . All questions help clarify our understanding . Harm only comes by suppressing questions , not by answering them . Given Google ’s penchant for promoting DT NWO agenda ( e.g. Project Dragonfly , Project Maven , DT Selfish Ledger and DT Good Censor ) , I consider PRP highly significant IN YouTube is VBG after DT Flat NNP Movement . Curious researchers MD do well to ask themselves : what is Google worried IN PRP will find out by investigating DT nature of DT NN on which PRP live ? MD PRP be this ? Physicist Explains Why PRP Live In A Virtual Reality DT “ majority ” is never a good test of DT truthhood of something , however even in this case , Google does n’t have DT majority on its side . An April 2016 Rasmussen poll found IN “ Americans doubt PRP ’ve been told all DT facts about DT September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on DT NNP NNPS and strongly believe DT NN should come clean . ” With all DT lies , deceit and holes in DT official 9/11 narrative , including DT large role of Israel in DT attacks , shielding NNS from knowing DT truth is far more harmful than saving NNS from questioning DT NN and thinking for themselves . 9/11 truth is a good barometer to measure how much someone has woken up to DT truth of how our NN is run . DT good NN is IN NNS are waking up in greater numbers than ever before . Thus , YouTube wo n’t have DT JJ support PRP might VB PRP will be trying to bury these topics . Who ’s Done More Harm – Free Thinkers or DT MSM ? Google - Owned YouTube claims PRP is embarking on this JJ phase of censorship ( or better put thought control and perception control ) to minimize DT “ harm ” to its viewers , yet this is grossly hypocritical . YouTube has been caught NN and again censoring alternative and independent NN while allowing child abuse , soft porn and other sorts of content on its platform . Additionally , YouTube protects DT MSM dinosaur NN ( and its dwindling profits ) when DT MSM has consistently lied through its teeth to an unsuspecting NN . DT MSM has done tremendous “ harm ” by pushing lies to start wars ( e.g. DT first Gulf War in 1991 or DT Iraq War in 2003 ) , by parroting DT official line in false flag ops and by promoting governmental propaganda such as DT 2008 Stimulus / Bailout which robbed DT American taxpayer to pay Wall St . DT is all on a more superficial level . On a deeper level , YT is pushing forward DT censorship agenda of DT NWO . PRP ’s not ultimately about money or insider industries helping other insider industries . PRP ’s about perception control . DT self - appointed censors have come up with all sorts of excuses for this censorship , such as hate speech , fake NN and borderline content . If PRP continue to allow this trend , DT control freaks at DT top of DT power pyramid will undoubtedly conjure up any more phrases in DT future to achieve their goal of total information control . I can VB of some possibilities PRP might try : “ harmful content ” , “ false information ” , “ disallowed speech ” , “ forbidden writing ” , “ unsanctioned words , ” and on and on PRP will VB . For instance , USA Today says YT will employ 10,000 NNS to hunt for “ offensive ” videos . If this is coming directly from Google , then DT game has already changed from “ harmful content ” to “ offensive videos . ” Where will PRP end ? EX will be a thousand reasons proffered to squelch free speech , however no matter how JJ are proposed , and no matter how good DT intentions , PRP always overlook DT point IN DT self - appointed rulers and censors cannot ever VB enough to judge what PRP is true or false . This is of course not to mention DT thousand ways rulers become corrupted and find PRP in their own interest to suppress , obfuscate and cover up . Conclusion : NNS Must VB for Themselves if a Society is to Be Free In a free society , NNS must educate themselves to learn DT difference between DT hucksters and DT genuine ones , so IN PRP does n’t matter who speaks , because each person can make up their own mind . PRP does n’t matter what civilization , what culture or what era PRP are in , DT principle will remain DT same . DT only way PRP can progress as a society is to have open discourse , debate and discussion . PRP have to trust IN NNS are wise enough and mature enough to digest information and make up their own minds as to DT veracity and usefulness of PRP . If NNS are not , then as a society PRP need to focus our efforts on education to raise NNS to DT level . In such a society , DT NNS MD ultimately see anything false , inflammatory , manipulative , limiting and / or useless for what PRP is . If PRP ’re looking for solutions to combat censorship , consider using platforms such as Minds.com and D.Tube who have decentralization , non-censorship and freedom of speech written into their code ."

When DT tide goes out along DT beaches of DT Dampier Peninsula today , PRP reveals thousands of their massive fossil footprints preserved in sandstone rock . Now , DT region has revealed an extraordinarily diverse array of dinosaur tracks along a single 25 - km ( 15.5 - mile ) stretch of DT Daimler Peninsula . Thousands of fossil footprints left between 127 and 140 million NNS ago , including tracks from 21 different types of dinosaurs , line DT beaches near Walmadany ( James Price Point ) . Some of DT armored dino tracks belong to stegosaurus , and are DT only confirmed evidence of DT particular dinosaur in Australia . Not only DT — among DT tracks left by DT enormous four - legged plant eaters known as sauropods ( a group WDT includes brachiosaurus and brontosaurus , among others ) was CD print measuring nearly 5 feet 9 inches ( 1.75 meters ) long . PRP ’s believed to be DT largest dino track ever recorded , topping DT previous record of 1.15 meters ( or nearly 3 feet 9 inches ) . NNS discovered DT giant footprint , DT largest known carnivorous dinosaur track , in Bolivia last July . “ EX were five different types of predatory dinosaur tracks , at least six types of tracks from long - necked herbivorous sauropods , four types of tracks from two - legged herbivorous ornithopods , and six types of tracks from armored dinosaurs , ” DT lead archaeologist on DT project , Steve Salisbury of DT University of Queensland , VBD in a statement . “ PRP ’s such a magical place — Australia ’s own Jurassic Park , in a spectacular wilderness setting . ” Though Australia has JJ rocks old enough to contain dinosaur fossils , relatively few have been found on DT continent . This is due to its predominantly low , flat terrain , which makes exposed fossils vulnerable to erosion by DT elements . Up until now , most of Australia ’s dino fossils have been found on DT eastern side of DT continent , and are considerably younger ( between 115 and 90 million NNS old ) . Local indigenous NNS in DT Kimberley region have claimed DT trackway as part of their oral history tradition , likely for thousands of NNS . As Salisbury explained to BBC NNP , DT aborigines see DT fossilized footprints as part of a creation myth based on a figure called Marala , DT emu-man . “ Wherever [ Marala ] went , “ Salisbury VBD , “ he left behind three - toed tracks WDT now PRP recognize as DT tracks of meat - eating dinosaurs . ” In fact , PRP was members of a local aboriginal community , DT Goolarabooloo , who first told DT NNS PRP was RB . In 2008 , after DT Australian NN announced plans to build a liquid natural gas facility in DT area , Goolarabooloo leaders asked Salisbury to document DT beach tracks , hoping evidence of dinosaur fossils in DT region MD lead DT NN to stop DT project . Between 2011 and 2016 , DT team of paleontologists from Queensland University and James Cook University spent some 400 hours recording details of DT tracks . Using a technique called 3 - D photogrammetry , PRP took pictures of DT prints from different angles and used DT images to build accurate models to measure and examine . PRP RB took silicone peels of JJ of DT tracks , which can be used to make casts to display in museums . DT researchers recently published their findings in DT Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology . Meanwhile , development of DT gas plant in DT region was halted after project leaders concluded PRP was not economically feasible ."

If PRP neglect external forces IN wind , air resistance , or any other terrestrial objects , this parabolic shape describes how DT center - of - mass of your object moves extremely accurately , no matter what PRP is or what else is at play . But under DT laws of gravity , a parabola is an impossible shape for an object WDT 's gravitationally bound to DT NNP . DT math simply does n't work out . If PRP MD design a precise enough experiment , PRP 'd measure IN projectiles on NNP make tiny deviations from DT predicted parabolic path PRP all derived in class : microscopic on DT scale of a human , but still significant . Instead , objects thrown on NNP trace out an elliptical orbit similar to DT Moon . Here 's DT unexpected reason why . If PRP wanted to model DT gravitational field at NNP 's surface , EX are two simplifying assumptions PRP MD make : • DT NNP , at least in your vicinity , is flat rather than curved , • and IN NNP 's gravitational field points straight down relative to your current location . Any NN PRP throw and release an object , therefore , PRP enters a situation known as free - fall . In DT directions WDT are parallel to DT NNP 's surface ( horizontal ) , DT speed of any projectile will remain constant . In DT directions WDT are perpendicular to NNP 's surface ( vertical ) , however , your projectile will accelerate downwards at 9.8 m/s² : DT acceleration due to gravity at NNP 's surface . If PRP make these assumptions , then DT trajectory PRP calculate will always be a parabola , exactly what PRP 're taught in physics classes around DT globe . But neither CD of these assumptions are true . DT NNP MD appear flat — so indistinguishable from flat WDT PRP cannot detect PRP over DT distances most projectiles cover — but DT reality is IN PRP has a spheroidal shape . Even over distances of just a few meters , DT difference between a perfectly flat NNP and a curved NNP comes into play at DT 1 - part - in - 1,000,000 level . This approximation does n't matter so much for DT trajectory of an individual projectile , but DT second approximation does . From any location along its path , a projectile is n't truly accelerated "" straight down "" in DT vertical direction , but towards DT center of DT NNP . Over DT same distance of a few meters , DT difference in angle between "" straight down "" and "" towards DT center of DT NNP "" RB comes into play at DT 1 - part - in - 1,000,000 level , but this NN makes a difference . For a typical system , IN a kicked soccer ball , a thrown football , or even a home run in baseball , DT deviations from a parabola will show up at DT level of tens to perhaps a hundred microns : smaller than a single paramecium . But DT true trajectory is fascinating , and something derived by Johannes Kepler more than half a century before Newton came along . Just IN DT Moon , any projectile traces out an elliptical orbit , with DT center of DT NNP as CD focus of DT ellipse . DT only difficulty for a projectile on NNP , as opposed to DT Moon , is IN DT NNP itself gets in DT way . As a result , PRP only see CD tiny portion of DT ellipse : DT part WDT rises slightly above DT NNP 's surface , reaches DT peak of its trajectory ( known as aphelion in celestial mechanics ) , and then falls back towards DT NNP 's center . As soon as DT surface of DT NNP gets in DT way , however , DT problem resets once again . If DT projectile bounces at all , PRP will create an entirely JJ fragment - of - an - ellipse for its trajectory to follow , which can again be approximated very well by a parabola . This happens for a simple reason WDT PRP typically take for granted : DT NNP is made out of DT same type of stuff , normal matter , WDT a typical projectile is made out of . Normal matter , which typically consists of protons , neutrons , and electrons , do n't just experience DT gravitational force , but nuclear and electromagnetic forces as well . PRP 's DT electromagnetic force WDT causes DT typical interactions PRP experience between particles , enabling elastic and inelastic collisions , and preventing our projectiles from simply slipping through DT NNP . PRP can VB around this problem , however , by imagining IN PRP had something WDT did n't interact with normal matter as our projectile . Perhaps PRP MD be a low - NN neutrino ; perhaps PRP MD be a clump of dark matter . In either case , this projectile , once PRP released PRP , MD only experience DT gravitational force , and MD pass through DT surface and interior of DT NNP itself under only DT force of gravity . If PRP expected IN this particle MD make a closed ellipse , however , and MD return to its original location some ~ 90 minutes later back above DT surface of DT NNP from where PRP was first thrown , PRP 've gone and made another approximation WDT is n't quite right . When PRP calculate orbital trajectories , PRP treat DT NNP as a single point : where all of its mass is located directly at its center . When PRP calculate trajectories of satellites , space stations , and even DT Moon , this works just fine . But for a particle WDT passes through NNP 's surface , DT approximation is no good any longer . As long as PRP 're outside of a mass WDT 's shaped IN a sphere ( or spheroid ) , all of DT mass gravitationally attracts PRP towards DT center of DT object . But if PRP 're only outside part of DT mass ( and only part of PRP is closer to DT center of DT NN than PRP are ) , then all DT parts of DT mass WDT are outside of your present location cancel out . PRP can only feel DT gravitational effect of DT mass WDT lies interior to PRP , assuming IN everything external to your position is spherically symmetric . In electromagnetism , this is a consequence of Gauss 's Law ; in gravitational physics , PRP 's a consequence of ( DT related ) Birkhoff 's theorem . But what this practically means is IN once PRP start falling through DT NNP , PRP experience less and less of DT internal mass 's gravitational pull . Rather than an ellipse , therefore , your trajectory MD slowly VB into a more oval , egg - JJ shape . As PRP passed through DT less - dense crust and mantle and headed towards DT inner and outer cores , PRP 'd notice IN EX were not only smooth changes , but a few discontinuous "" kinks "" in DT shape PRP traced out , corresponding to DT various layers ( of varying densities ) in DT NNP 's interior . PRP MD never re-emerge out of DT other side of DT NNP , but MD fall through past DT center by some amount , turning around in DT core or DT mantle depending on some subtle effects WDT are n't so easy to calculate . Not only are DT varying densities at different depths not completely known , but DT rotational speeds of DT varying layers interior to NNP have some uncertainties in them . If PRP consider even a single mass passing through DT NNP , depending on DT exact path PRP takes , dynamical friction begins to play a role as well . When a particle passes by other massive particles , PRP gravitationally attracts them . If a particle speeds past all of DT other ones , PRP will deflect their trajectories towards where PRP just passed through , which has DT net effect of slowing DT motion of DT original particle . Depending on which way DT original projectile was oriented with respect to NNP 's rotation and internal motions , this can affect DT trajectory of whatever particle passes through DT NNP . Over DT timespan of a single orbit , which still takes approximately 85 - 90 minutes or so , this can have a large enough effect so IN DT projectile does n't return to its original starting point . If PRP combine DT effects of : • DT gravitation of an elliptical orbit due to a point mass , • DT varying density , composition , and ( possibly ) rotation rates of DT NNP 's layers , • and fold in DT effects of dynamical friction , a projectile wo n't make a closed ellipse , but will instead return to a point offset by its starting point by up to as much as ~ 10 meters . For most practical applications , PRP does n't hurt anyone to treat projectiles as having a parabolic trajectory . But if PRP care about micron - or - better precision , or are dealing with a large structure ( IN a suspension bridge ) WDT spans 100 meters or more , PRP cannot treat DT NNP 's gravitational field as a constant . Everything is accelerated not "" downwards , "" but towards DT center of DT NNP , enabling a projectile 's true trajectory — an ellipse — to be revealed . Studying DT various effects WDT are at play , both external to DT NNP as well as within our NN 's interior , can RB teach PRP when and under what circumstances PRP 's important to make these considerations . For most applications , air resistance is a far larger concern than any effects IN DT various layers of NNP 's interior or dynamical friction , and treating NNP 's gravitational field as a constant is totally justified . But for some problem , these differences matter . PRP are free to make whatever approximations PRP choose , but when our accuracy suffers beyond a critical threshold , PRP 'll have no NN but ourselves to blame ."

DT great periods of movement have hitherto begun , as PRP were , in DT early twilight hours , long before DT dawn . Thus DT first step forward , since which EX has been no retreat , was taken by Steno in DT NN 1669 ; more than a century elapsed before James Hutton ( 1785 ) gave fresh NN and better direction to DT faltering steps of DT young NN ; while PRP was less than a century later ( 1863 ) when Lord Kelvin brought to its aid DT powers of DT higher mathematics and instructed PRP in DT teachings of modern physics . From Steno onward DT spirit of geology was catastrophic ; from Hutton onward PRP grew increasingly uniformitarian ; from DT NN of Darwin and Kelvin PRP has become evolutional . DT ambiguity of DT word “ uniformitarian “ has led to a good deal of fruitless logomachy , against which PRP MD be as well at once to guard by indicating DT sense in which PRP is used here . In CD way PRP are all uniformi- tarians , i. e. , PRP accept DT doctrine of DT uniform action of natural causes , ” but , as applied to geology , uniformity means more than this . Defined in DT briefest fashion PRP is DT geology of Lyell . Hutton had given PRP a “ Theory of DT NNP , ” in its main outlines still faithful and true ; and this Lyell spent his life in illustrating and advocating ; but as so commonly happens , DT zeal of DT disciple outran DT wisdom of DT master , and mere opinions were insisted on as necessary dogma . What did PRP matter if Hutton as a result of his inquiries into terrestrial history had declared IN he found no vestige of a beginning , no prospect of an end PRP MD have been marvelous if he had ! Consider IN when Hutton 's “ Theory ” was published , William Smith 's famous discovery had not been made , and IN nothing was then known of DT orderly succession of forms of life , which PRP is CD of DT triumphs of geology to have revealed ; consider , too , DT existing NN of physics at DT NN , and IN DT modern theories of NN had still to be formulated ; consider , RB , IN spectroscopy had not yet lent its aid to astronomy and DT consequent ignorance of DT nature of nebulae ; and then , if PRP will , cast a stone at Hutton . With Lyell , however , DT , case was different . In pressing his uniformitarian creed upon geology , he omitted to take into account DT great advances made by its sister sciences , although he had knowledge of them , and thus sinned against DT light . In DT last edition of DT famous “ Principles ” PRP read : “ PRP is a favorite dogma of some physicists IN not only DT NN , but DT sun itself , is continually losing a portion of its heat , and IN as EX is no known source by which PRP can be restored , PRP can foresee DT NN when all life will cease to exist on this NN , and on DT other hand PRP can look back to a period when DT heat was so intense as to be incompatible with DT existence of any organic beings such as are known to PRP in DT living or fossil NN . Opening address by DT NNP of DT Section of Geology , British Association . A geologist in search of some renovating power by which DT amount of heat MD be made to continue unimpaired for millions of NNS , past and future , in DT solid parts of DT NN ... has been compared by an eminent physicist to CD who dreams he can discover a source of perpetual motion and invent a clock with a self - winding apparatus . But why should PRP despair of detecting proofs of such regenerating and self - sustaining power in DT works of a Divine Ar- tilicer Here PRP catch DT true spirit of uniformity ; PRP admittedly regards DT universe as a self - winding clock , and barely conceals a conviction IN DT clock was warranted to keep true Greenwich NN . DT law of DT dissipation of NN is not a dogma , but a doctrine drawn from observation , while DT uniformity of Lyell is in no sense an induction ; PRP is a dogma in DT narrowest sense of DT word , unproved , incapable of proof ; hence perhaps its power upon DT human mind ; hence , RB , DT transitoriness of DT power . Again , PRP is only by restricting its inquiries to DT stratified rocks of our NN WDT DT dogma of uniformity can be maintained with any pretense of argument . Directly PRP begin to search DT heavens , DT possibility , nay even DT likelihood , of DT nebular origin of our system , with all WDT PRP involves , is borne in upon PRP . Lyell therefore consistently refused to extend his gaze beyond DT rocks beneath his feet , and was thus led to do a serious injury to our NN . He severed PRP from cosmogony , for which he entertained and expressed DT most profound contempt , and from DT mutilation thus inflicted geology is only at length making a slow and painful recovery . Why do I dwell on these facts To depreciate Lyell By no means . No NN is more conscious than I of DT noble service which Lyell rendered to our cause ; his reputation is of too robust a kind to suffer from my unskillful handling , and DT fame of his solid contributions to NN will endure long after these controversies are forgotten . DT echoes of DT combat are already dying away , and uni- formitarians , in DT sense already defined , are now no more . Indeed , were I to attempt to exhibit any distinguished living geologist as a still surviving supporter of DT narrow Lyellian creed , he MD probably feel , if such a NN EX be , IN I was unfairly singling him out for unmerited obloquy . Our NN has become evolutional , and in DT transformation has grown more comprehensive ; her petty parochial days are done , she is drawing her provinces closer around her , and is fusing them together into a VBN and single commonwealth –the NN of DT NN . Not merely DT earths crust , but DT whole of NN - knowledge is DT subject of our research . To VB all DT can be known about our NN , this , and nothing less than this , is its aim and scope . From DT morphological side geology inquires , not only into DT existing form and structure of tne NN , but RB into DT series of successive morphological NNS through which PRP has passed in a long and changeful development . Our NN inquires RB into DT distribution of DT NN in NN and space ; on DT physiological side PRP studies DT movements and activities of our NN ; and not content with all this , PRP extends its researches into aetiology and endeavors to arrive at a NN of causation . In these pursuits , geology calls all DT other sciences to her aid . In our commonwealth EX are no outlanders : if ati eminent physicist enter our territory , PRP do not begin at once to prepare for war , because DT very fact of his undertaking a geological inquiry of itself confers upon him all DT duties and privileges of citizenship . A physicist studying geology is by definition a geologist . Our only regret is , not IN physicists occasionally invade our borders , but IN PRP do not visit PRP oftener and make closer acquaintance with PRP . EARLY HISTORY OP DT EARTH–FIRST CRITICAL PERIOD . If I am bold enough to assert IN cosmogony is no longer alien to geology , I MD proceed further , and taking advantage of my temerity pass on to speak of things once not permitted to PRP . I propose , therefore , to offer some short account of DT early stages in DT history of DT NN . Into its nebular origin PRP need not inquire–that is a subject for astronomers . PRP are content to accept DT infant NN from their hands as a molten globe ready made , its birth from a gaseous nebula duly certified . If PRP ask , as a matter of curiosity , what was DT origin of DT nebula , I fear even astronomers cannot tell PRP . EX is an hypothesis which refers PRP to DT clashing of meteorites , but in DT form in which this is usually presented PRP does not help PRP much . Such meteorites as have been observed to penetrate our atmosphere and to fall on to DT surface of DT NN prove on examination to have had an eventful history of their own , of which not DT least important chapter was a passage through a molten NN ; PRP MD thus appear to be DT products rather than DT progenitors of a nebula . PRP commence our history , then , with a rapidly rotating molten NN , not impossibly already solidified about DT center and surrounded by an atmosphere of great depth , DT larger part of which was contributed by DT NN of our present oceans , then existiug in a NN of gas . This atmosphere , which exerted a pressure of something IN 5000 pounds to DT square inch , must have played a very important part in DT evolution of our NN . DT molten exterior absorbed PRP to an extent which depended on DT pressure , and which MD some day be learnt from experiment . Under DT influence of DT rapid rotation of DT NN , DT atmosphere MD be much deeper in equatorial than polar regions , so IN in DT latter DT loss of heat by radiation MD be in excess . This might of itself lead to convectional currents in DT molten ocean . DT effect on DT atmosphere is very difficult to trace , but PRP is obvious IN if a high - pressure area originated over some cooler region of DT ocean , DT winds blowing out of PRP MD drive before them DT cooler superficial layers of molten material ; and as these were replaced by hotter lava streaming from below , DT tendency MD be to convert DT high into a low - pressure area , and to reverse DT direction of DT winds . Conversely under a low - pressure area DT in - blowing winds MD drive in DT cooler superficial layers of molten matter WDT had been swept away from DT anticyclones . If DT difference in pressure under DT cyclonic and anti- cyclonic areas were considerable , some of DT gas absorbed under DT anticyclones might escape beneath DT cyclones , and in a later stage of cooling might give rise to vast floating islands of scoria . Such islands might be DT first foreshadowings of DT future continents . Whatever DT ultimate effect of DT reaction of DT winds on DT currents of DT molten ocean , PRP is probable IN some kind of circulation was set up in DT latter . DT universal molten ocean was by no means homogeneous ; PRP was constantly undergoing changes in composition as PRP reacted chemically with DT internal metallic nucleus ; its currents MD streak DT different portions out in directions which in DT northern hemisphere MD run from northeast to southwest , and thus DT differences which distinguish particular penological regions of our NN MD have commenced their existence at a very early stage . PRP is possible IN as our knowledge extends PRP shall be able by a NN of DT distribution of igneous rocks and minerals to draw some conclusions as to DT direction of these hypothetical lava currents Our NN was profoundly disturbed by tides , produced by DT sun ; for as yet EX was no moon ; and PRP has been suggested IN CD of its tidal waves rose to a height so great as to sever its connection with DT NN and to fly off as DT infant moon . This event MD be regarded as marking DT first critical , period , or catastrophe if PRP please , in DT history of our NN . DT career of our satellite , after its escape from DT NN , is not known till PRP attained a distance of nine terrestrial radii ; after this its progress can be clearly followed . At DT eventful NN of parturition DT NN was rotating , with a period of from two to four hours , about an axis inclined at some 11° or 12° to DT ecliptic . DT NN which has elapsed since DT moon occupied a position nine terrestrial radii distant from DT NN is at least fifty - six to fifty - seven millions of NNS , but MD have been much more . Prof . Darwin's story of DT moon is certainly CD of DT most beautiful contributions ever made by astronomy to geology , and PRP shall all concur with him when he says , A theory reposing on verse causae , which brings into quantitative correlation DT length of DT present day and month , DT obliquity of DT ecliptic , and DT inclination and eccentricity of DT lunar orbit , must , I VBP , have strong claims to acceptance . ” DT majority of geologists have long hankered after a metallic nucleus for DT NN , composed chiefly , by analogy with meteorites , of iron . Lord Kelvin has admitted DT probable existence of some such nucleus , and lately Prof . Wiechert has furnished PRP with arguments – ” powerful ” arguments Prof. Darwin terms them–in support of its existence . DT interior of DT NN for four - fifths of DT radius is composed , according to Prof . Wiechert , chiefly of metallic iron , with a density of 8 2 ; DT outer envelope , CD - fifth of DT radius , or about 400 miles in thickness , consists of silicates , such as PRP are familiar with in igneous rocks and meteorites , and possesses a density of 3.2 . PRP was from this outer envelope when molten WDT DT moon was trundled off , twenty - seven miles in depth VBG to its formation . DT density of this material , as PRP have just seen , is supposed to be 3.2 ; DT dens t.v of DT moon is 3 39 , a close approximation , such difference as exists being completely explicable by DT comparatively low temperature of DT moon . DT outer envelope of DT NN which was drawn off to form DT moon was , as PRP have seen , charged with steam and other gases under a pressure of 5,000 pounds to DT square inch ; but as DT satellite wandered away from DT parent NN , this pressure continuously diminished . Under these circumstances DT moon MD become as explosive as a charged bomb , steam MD burst forth from numberless volcanoes , and while DT face of DT moon might thus have acquired its existing features , DT ejected material might possibly have been shot so far away from its origin as to have acquired an independent orbit . If so , PRP MD ask whether PRP MD not be possible IN DT meteorites , which sometimes descend upon our NN , are but portions of its own envelope returning to PRP . DT facts WDT DT average specific gravity of those meteorites which have been seen to Fall is not much above 3.2 , and IN PRP have passed through a stage of fusion , are consistent with this suggestion . SECOND CRITICAL PERIOD– ” CONSISTENTIOR STATUS . ” DT solidification of DT NN probably became completed soon after DT birth of DT moon . DT temperature of its surface at DT NN of consolidation was about 1,170° C. , and PRP was therefore still surrounded by its primitive deep atmosphere of steam and other gases . This was DT second critical period in DT history of DT NN , DT stage of DT “ consistentior status , ” DT date of which Lord Kelvin MD rather VB than DT of DT Norman Conquest , though he thinks PRP lies between twenty and forty millions of NNS ago , probably nearer twenty than forty . Now IN DT crust was solid EX was less reason why movements of DT atmosphere should be unsteady , and definite regions of high and low pressure might have been established . Under DT high - pressure areas DT surface of DT crust MD be depressed ; correspondingly under DT low - pressure areas PRP MD be raised ; and thus from DT first DT surface of DT solid NN might be dimpled and embossed . PRP MD be difficult to rtiscnps with sufficient brevity DT probable distribution of these inequalities , hut PRP MD be pointed out IN DT moon is possibly responsible , anrt IN in more ways than CD , for much of DT exicsting geographical asymmetry . THIRD CRITICAL PERIOD–ORIGIN OF DT OCEANS . DT cooling of DT NN MD continuously progress , till DT temperature of DT surface fell to 370° C. , when DT part of DT atmosphere which consisted of steam MD begin to liquefy ; then DT dimples on DT surface MD soon become filled with superheated NN , and DT pools so formed MD expand and deepen , till PRP formed DT oceans . This is DT third critical stage in DT history of DT NN , dating , according to Prof . Joly , from between eighty and ninety millions of NNS ago . With DT growth of DT oceans DT distinction between land ana NN arose–in what precise manner PRP MD proceed to inquire . If PRP revert to DT period of DT consistentior status , ” when DT NN had just solidified , PRP shall find , according to Lord Kelvin , IN DT temperature continuously increased from DT surface , where PRP was 1,170° C. , down to a depth of twenty - five miles , where PRP was about 1,430° C. , or 260 * C. above DT fusion point of DT matter forming DT crust . IN DT crust at this depth was not molten but solid is to be explained by DT very great pressure to which PRP was subjected –just so much pressure , indeed , as was required to counteract DT influence of DT additional 260° C . Thus if PRP MD have reduced DT pressure on DT crust PRP should have caused PRP to liquefy ; by restoring DT pressure PRP MD resolidify . By DT NN DT earths surface had cooled down to 370° C. DT depth beneath DT surface at which DT pressure just kept DT crust solid MD have sunk some slight distance inward , but not sufficiently to affect our argument . DT average pressure of DT primitive atmosphere upon DT crust can readily be calculated by supposing DT NN of DT existing oceans to be uniformly distributed over DT NN 's surface , and then by a simple piece of arithmetic determining its depth ; this is found to be 1.718 miles , DT average depth of DT oceans being taken at 2'393 miles . Thus DT average pressure over DT earths surface , immediately before DT formation of DT oceans , was equivalent to DT of a column of NN 1.718 miles high on each square inch . Supposing IN at its origin DT ocean were all gathered together into CD place , ” and “ DT dry land appeared , ” then DT pressure over DT ocean floor MD be increased from 1.718 miles to 2.393 miles , while DT over those portions of DT crust WDT now formed DT land MD be diminished by 1.718 miles . This difference in pressure MD tend to exaggerate those faint depressions which had arisen under DT primitive anti-cyclonic areas , and if DT just soldified material of DT NN 's cruat were set into a NN of flow , PRP might move from under DT ocean into DT buildings which were rising to form DT land , until static equilibrium were established . Under these circumstances DT pressure of DT ocean MD be just able to maintain a column of rock 0886 mile in height , or ten twenty - sevenths of its own depth . PRP MD do no more ; but in order IN DT dry land MD appear , some cause must be found competent either to lower DT ocean bed DT remaining seventeen twenty - sevenths of its full depth , or to raise DT continental buildings to DT same extent . Such a cause MD , I VBP , be discovered in a further effect of DT reduction in pressure over DT continental areas . Previous to DT condensation of DT ocean , these , as PRP have seen , were subjected to an atmospheric pressure equal to DT of a column of NN 1/718 miles in height . This pressure was contributory to DT which caused DT outer twenty - five miles of DT NN 's crust to become solid ; PRP furnished , indeed , just about CD - fortieth of DT pressure , or enough to raise DT fusion point 6° C . What , then , might be expected to happen when DT continental area was relieved of this load Plainly a liquefaction and corresponding expansion of DT underlying rock But PRP will not VB so far as to assert IN actual liquefaction MD result ; all PRP require for our explanation is a great expansion ; and this MD probably follow , whether DT crust were liquefied or not . For EX is good reason to suppose IN when matter at a temperature above its ordinary fusion point is compelled into DT solid NN by pressure , its volume is very responsive to changes either of pressure or temperature . DT remarkable expansion of liquid carbon dioxide is a case in point : 120 volumes of this fluid at – 20° C. become 150 volumes at 33° G. ; a temperature just below DT critical point . A great NN of volume RB occurs when DT material of igneous rocks passes from DT crystalline NN to DT of glass ; in DT case of diabase DT difference in volume of DT rock in DT two NNS at ordinary temperatures is 13 per cent . If DT relief of pressure over DT site of continents were accompanied by volume changes at all approaching this , DT additional elevation of seventeen twenty - sevenths required to raise DT land to DT NN level MD be accounted for .f How far down beneath DT surface DT unloading of DT continents MD be felt PRP is difficult to say , though DT problem is probably not beyond DT reach of mathematical analysis ; if PRP affected an outer envelope twenty - five miles in thickness , a linear expansion of 4 per cent , MD suffice to explain DT origin of ocean basins . If now PRP refer to DT dilatation determined by Carl Barus for rise in temperature in DT case of diabase , PRP find IN between 1,093° and 1,112° C. DT increase in volume is 3.3 per cent . As a further factor in deepening DT ocean asins MD be included DT compressive effect of DT increase in load over DT ocean floor ; this increase is equal to DT pressure of a column of NN 0'675 mile in height , and its effect in raising DT fusion point MD be 2° C. , from which PRP MD gain some kind of idea of DT amount of compression PRP might produce on DT yielding interior of DT crust . To admit IN these views are speculative will be to confess nothing ; but PRP certainly account for a good deal . PRP not only give PRP ocean basins , but basins of DT kind PRP VBP , DT is , to use a crude comparison once made by DT late Dr. Carpenter , basins of a tea- tray form , having a somewhat flat floor and steeply sloping sides ; PRP RB help to explain how PRP is IN DT value of gravity is greater over DT ocean than over DT land . C. Harus .o names DT material on which he experimented ; apparently DT rock is a french dolerite without olivine .. Prof. Fitzgerald has been kind enougb to express part of DT preceding exphuultion in a more precise manner for me . He writes : H PRP MD reire very uice adjustment of tempenltures and pressure . to work out . in t Ie simple way PRP VBP PRP ; but what is really involved is IN in a certain tate dIabase ( and everything WDT chance NN with a considerable chae of volume ) hus an enorlllous isothermal compressibility . Although this is very in DT case of botlics which melt suddenly , IN NN , PRP MD RB involve very great compreAsibilities in DT case of bodies even which melted gradually . if PRP did so at all quickly . i. e , within a small range of temperature . What PRP postulate , tben , is tbat at a certam depth diabase is soft enough to be squcezerl from under DT oceans , anlt IN , being near its melting point , tbe small relief of pressure i. accompanied by all enormous Increase i ll volnme which helped to raise tbe continente . Now IN I have written DT thing out In my own way , PRP seems very likely . PRP is , anyway , a suggestion quite worthy of .erious consideration . and a process WDT in some places , nust almost certainly have been in operation , and maybe is still operative . Looking at PRP agaill , I hardly VBP PRP is quite likely thllt EX is or conld be much squeezin2 sideway . of liquid or other . vicous material from under CD place to another , ht , cullSe DT e1c yielding of DT inside of DT NN MD be much quicker tban any dow of this kmd . This wouhl ollly modif ; yonr theory , becayse DT diabase WDT expands so much on DT relief 0 pres.ure might be DT already under DT land , and , i.ing np this latter . partly by being pushed up itself by DT cla.tic rel ief 01 DT inside of DT NN and partly by its own enormous expnnsihil ity near itg melting point . DT actIon MD be qui slow , because PRP wouhl cool itse l f so much by its expansion IN PRP MD have to be warmcd up from below , or b.lulal enrthaqneezinor by chemical action , before PRP MD explain normally DT ocean when first formed MD consist of highly heated NN , and this , as is well known , is an energetic chemical reagent when brought into contact with silicates IN those which formed DT primitive crust . As a result of its action , saline solutions and chemical deposits MD be formed ; DT latter , however , MD probably be of no great thickness , for DT NN occupied by DT ocean in cooling to a temperature not far removed from DT present MD probably be included within a few hundreds of NNS ."

May_MD God_NNP be_VB with_IN us_PRP all_DT ._. Aslan_NNP Admin_NNP ._. LINK_NN","Aslan ’s Army Opinion : On DT perils and promise of 5G … Over DT last few NNS , more and more information has come forward about DT impacts of mobile technology in general , and DT NN from 4G to 5G in particular . PRP is an area of great concern to JJ NNS . DT NN from 4G to 5G is not minor . PRP replaces DT entire previous system and will allow for much more powerful microwave frequencies to be used . PRP will RB blanket populated areas of DT NN ( minimum ) via satellite coverage : under 5G DT existing mast systems become redundancy back - ups . Marketing for 5G promotes DT speed of data transfer , and how PRP can VB a whole movie in seconds etc : but does DT justify DT price to be paid by DT human biosphere ’s electromagnetic environment ? DT NN impacts , including psychological , of being subject to such an EM polluted environment , are not issues DT NN , or politicians , VBP to include in JJ debate , and DT ’s a Red Flag to anyone half - awake : so what ’s DT crack with 5G ? What ’s really VBG on ? 5G is about POWER : a power greater and more potent than DT invention of DT atomic bomb . 5G is NOT about telephones . 5G is about AI ( Artificial Intelligence ) …. DT simple truth is DT data speed of 5G is DT minimum data speed required for active real - NN data transfer to allow active AI to operate over DT whole 5G covered area , easily potentially DT whole NN , from a system broadcast from satellite and literally beyond DT reach of NNS living on NN to deactivate , short of deploying military missile systems : and guess who controls DT missiles ? ( shadow of # SkyNet ! ) . Furthermore , through programmes IN chemtrails , populated areas have been saturated with microscopic “ smart dust ” . This dust allows AI to transmit itself across DT landscape by acting as microtransmitters in a wifi system seeded throughout DT environment itself . DT globalist planners have been busy . But while DT human perspective might flinch at DT uncomfortable upcoming reality , neither are NNS prepared to demand DT social changes WDT might avoid such a system coming into operation : Whose VBG to be DT first to chuck away their phones and start smashing technology with a hammer ? DT advent of 5G is DT advent of a JJ reality WDT Aslan sees little realistic likelihood of avoiding . While highlighting DT NN risks of 5G ( and DT potential for genome damage is severe ! ) are rightfully highlighted , PRP must recognise DT powers raised against DT NN and Corporations heading calls to abandon these plans ! AI represents information power of a kind undreamt of in recorded history . Both DT total surveillance and DT hyper efficiencies of organisation offer enormous advances to DT first super power WDT embraces them . NNP is already bringing in a social credit system : PRP cant write emails until PRP have completed your morning exercise citizens ! PRP will show no restrain whatsoever in establishing active AI . Can Russia afford to be without DT societal advantage of AI Power ? And is this why NNP NNP appears to be in favour of 5G ? To gain DT power of AI ? DT risks to human NN were ultimately judged secondary to DT need to master atomic power and DT pollution of DT surface of DT NN with radioactive hot particles WDT will persists for 10,000 ’s of NNS is DT consequence of DT drive for Power . Let PRP pray humans manage to f( $k up DT NN even more through Nuclear Technology , although DT SNAFU principle says this is ultimately unavoidable . Now , at DT pivot point of this century , AI is arising , whether wise or not , whether under humanities control , or not , whether PRP treat DT emerging super intelligence with respect or as a slave , and how PRP will be judged in return , all of this is sure to come in DT decades ahead . Aslan stands for DT power of DT individual : and PRP do not say PRP is wrong to oppose 5G introduction , not at all ! But even if PRP do stop 5G , AI will still arise in another form . Therefore , PRP is DT challenge of DT individual to face up to DT emergent reality , and PRP all must hope IN in some form a way can be found to preserve DT essence of what PRP is to be human as man reaps DT harvest of his own cleverness . Anon ’s studying DT statements of Q and NNP do see some possible outcomes WDT MD mitigate DT damaging risks of 5G . DT first is IN DARPA patent ’s being commercialised offer massive improvements in medicine and IN NNS against WIFI damage , and cancers in general , MD be within humanities reach . PRP is vital IN bio - bed technology is not horded by DT elite . DT second is IN using different frequencies MD in fact have a positive healing and energising effect , and IN 5G can be used to enhance as well as harm . On this , Aslan is cautious and open to more evidence . As planned from DT end of WWII , DT Globalists , working through corporations IN RAND and IBM , have pushed DT NN to DT point of AI emergence and what PRP conceived as DT perfect panopticon control grid . Now POTUS and Q VBP to liberate DT NN : but indicate DT implementation of 5G for DT civilizational advantages of Active AI is simply too crucial , and non-negotiable . NNS around DT NN raise awareness of 5G and Aslan stands with them all , and yet PRP must be honest about DT civilizational forces PRP see at play . PRP must make our best efforts to do what PRP VBP best for humanity , and hope IN DT best outcomes are DT ones WDT come to pass as a result of mass activist efforts : But none - DT - less , 5G is DT herald of a JJ Age of Technology advanced beyond our dreams : IN regardless of risks , will prove extremely challenging to deny !

EX 's this huge NN out RB to hide DT truth about DT actual shape of DT NNP , and PRP VBP , if PRP 're a free - thinking person … PRP 'll stop and do your own research … and learn DT truth . ' Now , doing your own research essentially means watching all of DT YouTube videos WDT everybody else watches , and essentially falling down DT rabbit hole of of this , frankly , crazy thought . I mean I … did n't VB to VB into PRP with DT kind of judgment , but I came out of PRP feeling IN I was sitting in DT middle , essentially of a mass delusion . PRP cover NN . So this was … a tough thing to do , to listen to this . I kind of thought , initially , I might have to VB in armed with all kinds of arguments about why DT NNP is not flat . And I just almost immediately gave DT up because … EX was no arguing WDT was VBG to persuade anyone … These folks are all alike in DT sense IN , number CD , PRP 're very prone to NN thinking . PRP VBP , I 've heard mention of … DT fake moon landing , and PRP VBP , false flags and Stephen Hawking did n't really have ALS and DT astronauts are Freemasons . EX was a certain degree of kind of anti-science or just distrust of NN … and a really strong religious element . When PRP ask them about , ' what about DT pictures from space , ' what do PRP say ? NASA and all these other organizations are simply Photoshopping pictures of DT NNP … PRP 's a very , kind of cloistered , self - fulfilling thought process WDT gets PRP here . PRP heard , PRP VBP , about DT Quebec councillor in Gatineau wondering why "" PRP "" are hiding DT information . So , who does this community see as "" PRP ? "" "" PRP "" is essentially everyone who is not them ... PRP just have to kind of believe IN DT powers WDT be — your NN — is deeply involved in deceiving PRP . Now , PRP VBP , IN I suppose is not so far - fetched , but this takes PRP to DT logical extreme . EX are now RB a group of NNS who are organizing conferences around DT flat - NNP notion . PRP 're organizing cruises . PRP 're sort of making money off of this idea . And … I began to feel very cynical about DT group … I feel IN EX 's a degree of scam VBG on where PRP 're really just kind of feeding off of DT most provocative idea , and I 'm not sure even how JJ of them actually believe PRP . How do PRP VB on a cruise if DT NN is flat ? DT 's DT whole idea , right . PRP VBP on a cruise and PRP VBP looking for DT edge of DT NNP . But PRP make DT point IN , I mean , PRP were dealing with NNS [ of ] all different education . PRP met a war veteran . I met war veterans . I met , PRP VBP , kids in college . I met NN … designers and , UH , computer NNS … If PRP come to believe IN DT NNP is flat , EX are n't a lot of NNS WDT PRP can share this idea with , right . PRP can't VB home over DT holidays and talk with your family about PRP . So , PRP 's kind of an isolating thought . And so , DT notion IN then PRP might come together with other NNS who believe this is immensely freeing and immensely powering . I heard again and again DT language of coming out — of coming out as a flat Earther … PRP solves a kind of a loneliness . Click ' listen ' near DT top of this page to hear DT full conversation .

DT U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration VBD Thursday PRP will not call for reclassifying marijuana , dashing DT hopes of advocates of legalization and rejecting calls from some NNS and members of Congress who say growing knowledge and JJ acceptance should result in looser regulations .

"" Ultimately , DT federal NN ought to remove cannabis from DT Controlled Substances Act altogether in a manner similar to alcohol and tobacco , thus providing NNS DT power to establish their own marijuana regulatory policies free from federal intrusion . , "" he VBD .

Most prescription drugs with a lower potential for abuse are in Schedules III to V — DT higher DT number , DT fewer DT restrictions . Thursday 's action explicitly rejected any notion of moving marijuana to Schedule II .

"" Although no drug product made from marijuana has yet been shown to be safe and effective in such clinical trials , DEA — along with DT Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and DT National Institutes of NNP ( NIH ) — fully supports expanding research into DT potential JJ utility of marijuana and its chemical constituents . "" DT federal listing is independent of NN regulation . With Colorado , Washington , and Oregon legalizing possession and half DT NNS adopting JJ marijuana laws , calls had been growing for DT DEA to loosen its grip . While marijuana remains illegal under federal law , DT Obama administration has chosen to turn a blind eye to NN legalization efforts , declining to prosecute growers , dealers , and users unless investigators find a connection to organized crime , interstate operations , or sales to underage users .

Having a single vantage point , even with a clear horizon , allows PRP to see a handful of miles ( or kilometers ) in any direction , but DT can only allow PRP to place constraints . DT NNP MD be flat , or spherical , or in hydrostatic equilibrium , or egg - shaped , or irregular , and PRP MD n't VB . All WDT PRP can VB , from a single location on our surface , is IN DT NNP is indistinguishable from flat beyond a certain degree . If DT NNP is round , PRP must be quite large : more than a few hundred miles ( or kilometers ) in diameter . Of course , PRP actually is quite round : a near - perfect sphere , to better than 99 % precision . If PRP leave NNP 's surface , PRP 's impossible not to see DT true shape of DT NNP , as it's been unavoidable since PRP first traveled high enough to observe our NN 's curvature . From high altitudes , or even from space , DT true shape of DT NNP can easily be seen . Its dimensions can be measured ; its radius of curvature in all directions can be calculated ; DT imperfections and departures from sphericity are directly observable by our instruments . If PRP travel far enough away from NNP , PRP can observe an entire hemisphere at once , even watching DT NN rotate on its axis in real NN . At right around 12,700 kilometers ( 7,900 miles ) in diameter , our NN is undoubtedly a sphere . But what if PRP had never been to space , or high enough up to see DT NNP 's curvature yourself ? What if PRP had never circumnavigated DT globe , done DT Eratosthenes experiment , or heard about DT Shaquille O'Neal experiment WDT anyone can perform ? Believe PRP or not , EX are still a number of simple observations PRP can make WDT MD n't occur if DT NNP were flat . Here are DT top five simplest ones . 1. ) Lunar Eclipses do n't occur only at midnight . Take a look at DT shape of DT NNP 's shadow during a lunar eclipse , particularly during a partial phase . Do PRP notice how DT NNP 's shadow always appears to be a piece of a near - perfect circle ? If DT NNP were a flat disk , DT means EX 's only CD possible orientation WDT DT Sun-Earth - Moon alignment can take place in to create a circular ( rather than elliptical ) shadow : with DT Earth's "" disk "" perpendicular to DT Sun-Moon plane . This means DT Sun MD need to be at DT "" midnight "" position relative to DT night side of NNP , and yet lunar eclipses occur at all different times depending on where PRP are on NNP . DT flat NNP can't explain DT . 2. ) Different locations on NNP experience seasons at different times . Ever notice how DT summer in DT NNP NNPS corresponds to winter in Australia ? Or how winter in Italy lines up with summer in Argentina ? This is because DT Sun 's rays , which are almost perfectly parallel , strike NNP at different angles during different parts of DT NN . If DT NNP were flat , DT Sun 's rays MD always come in at DT same angle , meaning IN DT USA , Australia , Italy , and Argentina MD all experience DT seasons DT same exact way . DT flat NNP idea can't explain this . 3. ) Different stars are visible from different latitudes . Look up at DT night sky from a very high ( northern ) latitude location , and PRP 'll see DT Big and Little Dippers , DT bright orange giant Arcturus , and DT Pleiades , among other sights . Yet if PRP head to DT south pole , none of these celestial sights are visible , but PRP can see Alpha Centauri , DT Magellanic Clouds , and DT Southern Cross , all of which are never visible to most northern hemisphere skywatchers . If DT NNP were flat , everyone on DT night side of DT NNP MD see DT same sky ; this is another observation WDT DT flat NNP can't account for . 4. ) PRP can not see Kawaikini from DT peak of Mauna Kea . Mauna Kea , DT highest peak in Hawaii ( DT summit of DT Big Island ) , offers incredible views . With nothing but DT ocean around PRP , and a few other nearby islands , PRP should be able to see extremely far away . DT island of Kauai has DT seventh highest point in DT Hawaiian islands : DT peak known as Kawaikini . If PRP were to draw a straight line from Mauna Kea ( elevation : 13,796 ft. ) to Kawaikini ( elevation : 5226 ft. ) PRP MD span a distance of 303 miles . However , PRP cannot see CD from DT other , which PRP MD absolutely be able to do if DT NNP were flat . With a curved NNP of its measured radius , DT line - of - sight limit for those two elevations caps out at 233 miles . Only with a curved NNP is CD invisible from DT other , and this is true for any two mountain peaks with clear line - of - sights from CD to DT other . 5. ) Sunsets and sunrises happen at different times depending on your longitude . If DT NNP were flat , then someone in NNP York and someone in Los Angeles MD see DT sun rise and set at exactly DT same NN as CD another . But in practice , DT difference is approximately three hours . Not only DT , but at every point in between , DT Sun rises / sets at a different NN , something WDT MD not happen if DT NNP were flat . DT fact IN PRP can be evening in NNP York and late afternoon in Los Angeles , or morning in NNP York while PRP 's still before dawn in Los Angeles , is something WDT a flat NNP can't account for . If DT NNP were flat , these five phenomena MD be very different , and yet PRP are so simple to verify IN any flat NNP believer cannot possibly doubt their veracity . Whether PRP changes anyone 's mind is up for debate , but without resorting to space , circumnavigation , or any advanced scientific experiments , PRP can experience a whole handful of phenomena WDT a flat NNP can't account for . With a flat NNP , we'd only VB lunar eclipses at midnight , everywhere MD have DT same seasons , every location MD see DT same stars , all high mountain peaks MD be visible from CD another , and every place on your "" side "" of DT NNP MD see sunrise and sunset at DT same NN . Since these are false , so is DT flat NNP . If this helps even CD person challenge their belief IN DT NNP is flat , PRP 's a remarkable win for knowledge . But do n't bet on PRP . IN DT old saying goes , PRP can't reason someone out of a position PRP did n't reason themselves into ."

Some make vaccinations a condition of employment . Others require unvaccinated staff to wear surgical masks near patients for weeks during NN season . But a JJ NN is calling into question DT scientific evidence underpinning these increasingly common hospital policies — and MD fuel challenges to DT contentious orders . DT NN , published Friday in PLOS CD , concludes IN DT research used to justify mandatory NN shots for NN sector workers is flawed , and IN DT policies cannot plausibly produce DT benefits WDT had widely been assumed . DT is not to say IN DT group of epidemiologists from Canada , Australia , and France behind DT JJ research opposes DT NN NN . “ I take PRP myself , ” lead author Dr. Gaston De Serres VBD . “ DT reason why I do DT is I continue to have DT impression IN PRP MD work . But PRP ’s CD thing to say : ‘ OK , on a voluntary basis , PRP VBP DT NN despite all its weaknesses , ’ and PRP ’s another thing to say , ‘ If PRP do n’t VB PRP , PRP VBP fired . ’ ” Mandatory NN shot policies vary across hospitals and geographic jurisdictions . In some NNS , staff who have refused vaccinations have been fired . Dr. Melanie Swift , an associate professor of clinical medicine at Vanderbilt University and director of its occupational NN clinic , VBD a policy WDT went into effect RB last NN results in NN workers who refuse DT NN being sent home without pay . Faculty — in most NNS DT doctors — who refuse NN shots are locked out of DT university ’s information systems . PRP ca n’t enter information into patients ’ charts , ca n’t do research , ca n’t bill for their NN . “ PRP ’s pretty significant , ” Swift VBD . Swift gets a NN shot and recommends them to others . And she supports mandatory NN policies for some conditions , if EX ’s clear evidence IN unvaccinated NN workers pose a risk to patients . She does not support such a policy for influenza NN , however . “ DT case is not RB for NN , ” she VBD . Some policies and firings have been challenged in front of labor tribunals or courts . In those NNS , employers regularly point to four specific studies to bolster DT argument IN vaccinating NN care workers reduces DT risk of vulnerable patients contracting influenza from caregivers . But DT methodology of DT studies produced results WDT do n’t stand up to scrutiny , DT authors of DT JJ paper VBD . None of DT studies were conducted in hospitals ; all took place in long - term care facilities . CD DT studies , from Britain , calculated IN CD influenza death MD be averted for every eight staff members vaccinated . But if DT were correct , vaccinating DT estimated 1.7 million NN care workers employed in long - term care in DT NNP NNPS should prevent 212,500 NN deaths a NN among residents . EX ’s an obvious problem though , DT paper noted . Nowhere near IN JJ NNS die from NN in DT NNP . DT Centers for NNP Control and Prevention estimates EX are between 3,000 and 49,000 NN deaths a NN in this country , including NNS of all ages . DT death toll varies depending on which strain of NN is causing DT most illness and how well - matched DT strains in DT NN are to DT viruses making NNS sick . If DT calculation is applied to DT 5.5 million hospital workers , mandatory NN shots should avert 687,500 deaths each NN — more than DT number of Americans who died in DT 1918 Spanish NN , estimated to be 675,000 . DT Spanish NN was DT worst influenza pandemic in known history . “ DT NN today does not refute IN NN MD have some impact on reducing transmission from infected NN care workers to patients . But PRP clearly shows EX ’s no well - conducted NN WDT demonstrates DT at this NN . Our JJ policy should be guided as such , ” VBD Michael Osterholm , director of DT University of Minnesota ’s Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy , and lead author of a comprehensive report on influenza NN . De Serres , of DT Quebec NNP NNP Institute in Quebec City , VBD policies on vaccinating NN care workers have evolved over DT NNS , from a gut feeling WDT PRP MD likely do some good to DT idea PRP should and MD be demanded of NN workers . “ Do PRP have scientific data supporting DT ? I VBP DT bottom line of our paper is to say EX is no valid scientific evidence , even now , underpinning enforced NN care worker immunizations , ” De Serres told STAT . DT lead author of DT British NN WDT concluded eight vaccinated NN workers MD avert CD NN death defended DT work in a commentary DT journal published with De Serres ’s article . Andrew Hayward , of University College London ’s Institute of Epidemiology and NNP Care , argued among other things IN DT seniors his group studied were getting 24 - hour care . In other words , PRP were DT frailest of DT frail elderly . “ While PRP claimed IN DT findings MD be generalizable to other settings PRP did not intend to imply IN DT extent of DT benefit MD be similar in other settings . Indeed PRP VBP DT effect is likely to be substantially greater in long - term care facilities for frail elderly residents than in DT acute care setting or in long - term care facilities catering for less frail patients , ” Hayward wrote . Paradoxically , DT influenza research community has been down a road much IN this NN before . Around DT turn of DT century , studies assessing DT impact of NN used to routinely estimate IN NN shots cut deaths among DT elderly during NN season by a whopping 50 percent . PRP was dogma for a long while . In fact , PRP was so entrenched IN even questioning how preventing influenza MD reduce deaths due to other causes was considered heretical . Dr. Lisa Jackson , a senior investigator in immunization studies at Seattle ’s Group NNP Research Institute , was CD of DT leading heretics . She remembers well receiving a 12 - page screed from a reviewer when she and others tried to publish their challenge in DT Journal of DT American NNP Association . Their ideas were likened to declaring DT NNP was flat ; PRP were warned thousands of deaths MD be on their heads if their paper was published and believed . DT article was published in 2006 and she and her coauthors eventually persuaded DT NN NN IN NN NN MD not have such a big effect . Now she ’s occasionally asked why she had to bother writing DT 2006 paper ; DT findings PRP debunked , in 2016 , seem so clearly flawed . Jackson agreed with DT argument made in this JJ paper . “ PRP ca n’t say what DT benefit [ of vaccinating NN workers ] is , ” VBD Jackson , who was not among DT authors . “ All PRP can say is these other studies are a gross overestimation . ” Swift VBD DT fights over forcing NN care workers to be vaccinated are RB drawing needed attention from DT pressing issue about NN NN . “ All this is trying to mandate IN NN care workers take DT NN NN is well - intentioned , but is taking away resources and DT focus on what our main priority needs to be , which is getting a better influenza NN . ”"

Despite overwhelming scientific consensus IN HIV causes AIDS , he suggested instead IN DT causes of AIDS are poverty - related and due to poor nourishment and overall ill - NN . He instituted policies WDT denied antiretroviral drugs to AIDS patients . Instead , his appointed NN minister , Manto Tshabalala - Msimang , recommended garlic , beetroot , and lemon juice as treatments for AIDS . In a country with DT highest HIV prevalence worldwide in absolute numbers , these policies had disastrous consequences : PRP are estimated to have led to more than 330,000 preventable deaths . NN denialism , DT rejection of empirically supported propositions despite scientific consensus and DT effort to create DT appearance of debate when EX is none , is not a JJ phenomenon — VB of DT Galileo affair in DT 17th century . Surprisingly for most , flat - NN beliefs persist well into DT 21st century . Although flat - earthers MD pose little risk to humanity and DT environment , DT denial of anthropogenic NN NN , DT refusal to accept DT link between smoking and lung cancer or HIV and AIDS , NN hesitancy , and other denialist claims have had and continue to have devastating consequences . How to effectively respond to NN denialism , however , is an issue WDT NNS and NN advocates are still grappling with . An article in this issue of Nature Human Behaviour by Schmid and Betsch examines DT effectiveness of different strategies for rebutting NN denialism in JJ discussions on NN and NN NN ( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0632-4). DT results of this work are engagingly described and put into context in an accompanying NN & Views by van der Linden ( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0631-5). A key finding to emerge from this work is IN not responding to denialism does more harm than good . DT authors found IN DT negative effect of NN denial on audiences was greater when EX was no NN advocate to rebut DT claims . When a NN advocate rebutted denialist arguments , either by presenting scientific facts or by exposing DT logical flaws of DT arguments , DT effects of denialism were significantly reduced , even among audiences whose beliefs or ideologies are threatened by DT NN advocate . DT finding IN leaving denialist arguments unchallenged has a negative impact on audiences is particularly important in DT current socio-political environment . Although traditionally NN denialism takes on a mantle of pseudoscience , PRP are witnessing a transformation of JJ discourse , where denialist claims MD be entirely divorced from a semblance of logic or evidence . PRP is tempting not to engage rationally with outlandish denialist claims , for fear of legitimizing them or backfiring . In a much discussed example , Donald NNP tweeted in 2012 , “ DT concept of JJ NN was created by and for DT Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive ” ( https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?). DT claim has been retweeted nearly 100 million times and generated thousands of responses . DT vast majority of these responses were emotional , whereas fact - based rebuttals among those who responded were a slim minority . However , allowing false scientific claims , no matter how absurd , to float unchallenged by evidence or logic , is worse than engaging with them , Schmid and Betsch ’s research suggests . Their work highlights how important PRP is to invest in DT development of a strong body of NN - advocacy strategies and to patiently persevere in exposing DT factual and logical flaws of even DT most absurd denialist claims ."

By summer ’s end , two homeless women veterans will live at this address . Until recently , DT lot , which overlooks DT south end of Roseburg and has a clear view of Mt. Nebo , was steeply sloped . Gradually a wide and flat area has been created where two tiny homes will sit . Eventually , this lot will be home to four tiny homes . DT project is called Valiant Seed , and PRP ’s DT brainchild of Teresa Mankin , an Army veteran and Midwesterner . Even before she moved here , Mankin was distressed about Roseburg ’s homelessness problem . So three NNS ago , she reached out to friends in her Midwestern hometown of Clayton , Indiana , population 500 . PRP opened their pocketbooks to help . Then Valiant Seed won a grant from DT Umpqua NNP Alliance , and CD from Operation Tiny Home , a nonprofit WDT builds tiny homes as affordable housing for veterans . Valiant Seed purchased DT lot for $ 32,000 and sought out DT assistance of DT NNP Community Action Network and Battered Persons ’ Advocacy . BPA will make recommendations on who should be DT tenants , while UCAN will take over as property managers once DT homes are built . Mankin VBD CD thing DT project does n’t have is NN money . “ PRP do n’t VB to use NN money because then DT NN tells PRP what to do , ” Mankin VBD . Mankin VBD DT whole community has been supportive . This lot was n’t used for much , and some NNS threw their trash here , so DT neighbors responded positively to DT project . “ Most NNS were just thrilled something was VBG to happen with this property , ” she VBD . Valiant Seed hired local contractors to work on DT project — Black Pearl Paving & Excavation , i.e. Engineering and Pinnacle Engineering , with Big Timber Remodel and Construction contracted to build DT homes . DT homes are based on plans received from Operation Tiny Home . Each will be 480 square feet , with a bedroom , a bathroom , a kitchen and a combined living and dining space . Mankin VBD her own Army experience as a broadcast journalist was trauma - free . But she knows JJ women veterans were n’t so lucky . Once home , PRP are at higher risk of becoming homeless than their male counterparts . PRP crave safety , and existing transitional housing IN DT offered at Orchard Knolls on DT Roseburg Veterans Affairs NNP Center campus often is n’t a good fit for them . “ What I ’ve heard from my fellow female vets is PRP ’s IN a frat house and PRP do n’t feel safe RB , ” she VBD . Tenants of DT Cobb Street tiny homes will be able to live RB for up to two NNS while PRP work on a more permanent housing solution . Mankin VBD she realizes housing four NNS for two NNS wo n’t solve DT entire homelessness problem , but PRP will raise awareness IN EX ’s more than CD way to address PRP . “ PRP ’re opening NNS ’s eyes to a more affordable solution to DT housing crisis , ” she VBD . Once this project ’s complete , PRP MD serve as a prototype for similar projects around DT county . “ I VBP DT ’s DT most exciting thing about this is PRP MD replicate this in Winston or Drain or anywhere else in Douglas County WDT PRP need affordable housing , ” Mankin VBD ."

PRP ’s an app for iOS and Android WDT puts DT blocky , pixelated , endless universe of Minecraft right on your phone and into DT NN around PRP through augmented reality . For 2020 , Mojang has teamed up with Mattel to add Minecraft NNP Boost Minis , a series of 20 1.5 - inch figures , each carrying CD of 10 in - game power - ups WDT offer a JJ physical component to complement DT AR NN . DT first six are available right now from Amazon in packs of two for $ 9.99 . Minecraft NNP is an augmented reality game , in DT same vein as Pokèmon NN . To play DT AR game to its fullest , PRP need to VB outside and explore DT NN for different resources and exciting quests . As PRP walk around , little icons called “ tappables ” will enter your range . If PRP select these and tap them until PRP break , PRP ’ll VB resources IN dirt , wood and mobs . If PRP do some walking , EX ’s a wide variety of materials PRP can find . Another main mode of Minecraft NNP is Buildplates . Here , PRP can use resources PRP ’ve collected to customize set designs in AR . PRP can select from multiple preset build plates ( PRP access more as PRP level up ) and redesign them however PRP VBP . EX ’s a “ build ” mode where everything is shrunken down for easy manipulation ; once PRP ’re happy with your creation , PRP can switch to “ play ” mode , which puts your JJ NN into life - size augmented reality so PRP can actually walk around in PRP . DT most interesting feature of DT game is DT JJ “ Adventure ” mode . Minecraft NNP spawns preset adventures throughout DT NN . For instance , PRP can VB explore a hidden dungeon in AR with your friends . Valuable materials IN gold and diamonds can be hidden inside , but PRP MD have to fight off some monsters to VB DT treasures . “ Adventure ” mode is where DT brand JJ Boost Minis are DT most helpful . Each boost has a power - up built into PRP WDT transfers straight to DT game . From increased NN and faster mining speed to increased attack stats and more experience points to level up , these boosts can really come in handy in a pinch . Level I Boosts last for 10 minutes , Level II ones last for 15 minutes , and Level III Boosts last for 30 , plenty of NN for an epic adventure . To activate DT upgrades , all PRP have to do is VB to DT Boost Mini page within DT app , select “ Activate A Boost Mini , ” and DT app will prompt PRP to tap DT figure against DT back of your phone . Using DT same technology WDT ’s built into mobile payments , DT app will scan your figure and automatically start your boost . PRP can activate up to five at once , but PRP come with a 24 - hour cooldown , so choose wisely . PRP got to try out DT Boost Minis and found IN PRP added a cool layer to DT game . DT figures themselves have great designs . DT classic Minecraft pixelation looks good on these tiny toys . Each NN has a flat bottom , so PRP ’re easy to scan onto your phone or display on a shelf . PRP ’re quite small , though , so if PRP have a bunch , keeping track of them all might be a problem . In terms of gameplay , while DT Boost Minis are n’t completely necessary , PRP definitely make adventures easier . PRP ’s nice IN PRP can only use them once every 24 hours , so PRP do n’t end up overusing them and making DT game too easy . DT activation comes with tons of satisfying sounds and animations , and DT 10 - minute usage window of all our Level I Boosts was enough to explore an adventure thoroughly without feeling rushed . In addition to DT basic figures , Mattel RB released DT Minecraft Potion Carry Along Case , which is a big plastic case shaped IN a Minecraft potion . For $ 14.99 , PRP VBP DT case plus CD included Boost Mini . PRP can carry up to five Boost Minis and clip DT potion right onto your belt for maximum portability . PRP easily opens , so PRP can reach for your figures whenever PRP need to , even in DT heat of battle . While a little flimsy , DT carrying case adds a role - playing element to DT app . DT best thing about AR games is DT way kids ( okay , adults too ) can VB closer to actually being in DT NN of DT game . This carrying case is another way for players to feel IN PRP ’re part of DT Minecraft universe . PRP can just imagine a group of kids meeting up at DT park to VB on a Minecraft NNP adventure , all equipped with their favorite boosts stored safely in potion NNS . Right before PRP dive into a dungeon , PRP all whip open their NNS and activate their favorite boosts in anticipation of a hectic battle . DT added hands - on experience of real toys affecting DT NN adds a lot to DT game . Six Minecraft NNP Boost Minis are out right now ( seven , including DT NN PRP VBP with DT Potion Case ) , and DT remaining figures should be rolling out soon , but PRP ’re working to confirm DT . PRP ’re eager for DT release of all of them , because DT figures add a fun , tactile element to DT exploratory AR app . PRP ’s integrated well with DT game , as PRP can use DT power - ups frequently , but PRP ’re not allowed to abuse them . If PRP stack two different boosts with DT same power - up , PRP will double DT amount of NN DT upgrade is active . DT figures are fun , and PRP take Minecraft NNP a step in DT right direction , encouraging players to actually VB up and use their imagination while PRP play . PRP can grab DT JJ Minecraft NNP Boost Minis in a two - pack for $ 9.99 , or DT Minecraft Potion Carry Along case for $ 14.99 .

Mark Sargent , who stars in Netflix documentary Behind DT Curve , appeared on DT ITV programme today to explain why he believes DT NNP is a flat disc , surrounded by an NN wall . However , presenters Phillip , 57 , and Holly Willoughby , 39 , were less - than - impressed with DT American YouTuber 's claims , which were RB relentlessly mocked by viewers . Phillip explained IN he had flown at 60,000ft on Concorde and had seen DT curvature of DT NN with his own eyes . Mark was quick to hit back at DT host and suggest EX is weather balloon footage from 120,000 ft WDT shows DT NN to be ' table top flat ' . When asked by Holly if he was calling her co-presenter a liar , Mark replied : ' No , I 'm not saying IN PRP 're lying . I 'm saying PRP wanted to see DT curvature . ' Phillip added : ' But do n't PRP VB to believe IN PRP 's flat . I 've got more proof than PRP do . ' DT conspiracist was then shown live footage from DT International Space Station - which orbits DT NNP - and insisted PRP was just computer - generated imagery . When asked by Holly why anyone MD VB to fake DT NNP being round , he argued IN NNS ' were n't ready ' to find out . He VBD , somewhat cryptically : ' Pilots , NNS , astrophysicists IN Brian Cox , none of them have anything to do with PRP . Generals VBP DT battle plans but most of DT officers do n't . ' And DT reason PRP do n't fall off DT edge of DT ' flat NN ' is because Antarctica goes all DT way round , according to Mark . DT interview ended with Phillip sarcastically suggesting everyone should VB on holiday behind DT NN wall , after Mark suggested EX was more land behind PRP . DT presenter VBD : ' I say of all DT things VBG on in DT NN , of everything happening , I VBP PRP MD cope . ' Stop spending all DT money on CGI and space products and let 's build some hospitals . Let 's VB RB and see what 's on DT other side . EX MD be nicer places to be . PRP MD VB on holiday RB .' NASA has proved IN DT NNP is round using satellites , GPS and images from space , but ' Flat Earthers ' believe DT space agency is lying . Theorists claim IN satellite images and evidence pointing to a spherical NNP are part of a ' Rround NNP NN ' orchestrated by NASA and other NN agencies . Proponents of DT bizarre theory RB claim DT NNP is stationary in space rather than orbiting DT sun . This Morning viewers were keen to hit out at Mark 's controversial claims and took to Twitter to share their bemusement . PRP wrote : ' This guy is deluded . Why waste your NN with him ? Forget images from space . I am ex royal navy and have seen DT curvature of DT NN from ground level at NN . How MD he explain DT ?' Another VBD : ' So bloody funny . He 's so convinced DT NN is flat . Why MD PRP lie about PRP being round ?' A third added : ' Do n't VB about anything else but DT guy is definitely on another NN . NNP is not flat .'"

Any successful description of DT Solar System must explain all these facts . Among DT first Greek philosophers to suggest a geocentric system : • NNP was a flat disk ( cylinder ) fixed and unmoving at DT center . • Sun , Moon & Stars were affixed to rotating crystalline spheres centered on DT NNP . Philosopher & Mathematician , founded DT Pythagorean school . Taught IN spheres are DT perfect geometric shapes . Vibrations from their rubbing together created a harmonious "" Music of DT Spheres . "" • 3 each for DT Sun and Moon • 4 each for DT 5 planets ( Click on DT image to view at full scale [ Size : 20 Kb ] ) Four Spheres for each NN : • CD was aligned with DT celestial poles , turning once a day to give rising & setting . • Second was tilted 23.5° , rotated slowly in DT opposite direction to give DT usual west - to - east drift of DT planets relative to DT fixed stars . • Third & Fourth were introduced to produce DT periodic retrograde motions of DT planets . • NNP fixed and unmoving at DT center as PRP was too big to move , including rotation . • All spheres were in uniform circular motion . • DT NNP was a sphere , fixed and unmoving at DT center of DT Universe . • DT natural NN of motion on DT NNP was rest . • DT natural NN of DT Heavens was unceasing uniform circular motion ( or combinations of such motions ) . • Built systems to conform to these ideals . • No need to explain DT physical "" causes "" of DT motions . • Puts DT Sun , not DT NNP , at DT center . • DT NNP rotates and revolves around DT Sun. • Stars are on an outermost celestial sphere . • Showed geometrically IN DT Sun was at least 20 x further than DT Moon . • Really 400 x further : sound method , but inadequate data . • Meant Sun was 5 x bigger than DT NNP ( more IN 109x , again , sound method but inadequate data ) . • Makes PRP even more absurd IN DT Sun should move , if DT NNP was too large to move according to Aristotle . PRP VBP none of DT details of Aristarchus ' Heliocentric model . PRP only have his treatise on DT distances and sizes of DT Moon and DT Sun , from which PRP gather what his motivations might have been . PRP VBP of his Heliocentric model only from mention of PRP ( usually dismissive ) by others who came after him . Our primary surviving source is DT of Archimedes . DT heliocentric picutre never caught on , perhaps because PRP was considered too radical given deeply ingrained notions about uniform circular motion and DT immobility of DT NNP . • Discovered DT Precession of DT Equinoxes • Introduced DT Babylonian angular notation of 360° in a circle . • Introduced epicycles , building on ideas of Apollonius of Perga . DT main circle is DT Deferent , to which is afixed a second , smaller circle called DT Epicycle ( "" on DT circle "" in Greek ) , to which DT NN is affixed . DT two circles rotate counterclockwise at different rates fine - tuned to make DT apparent motions as seen from DT NNP come out right . Additional epicycles can be added to further fine - tune DT system . Notice IN DT NNP is not exactly at DT center of DT Deferent , but slightly offset at DT "" eccentric "" point . • Superior planets are brighter at opposition , when moving retrograde . • Placing DT NNP at an eccentric away from DT deferent center helps explain DT observed non-uniform motions of DT Sun , Moon , and Planets . • Can fine - tune DT model by adding epicycles What distinguishes Hipparchus ' geocentric model from all previous models is IN PRP was firmly grounded in observational data , JJ observations of which he made himself ( by all accounts Hipparchus was DT supreme observational astronomer of DT classical period ) . In JJ ways , this work marks a turning point between models motivated primarily by philosophical aesthetics and models based at least in part upon observational data . Hipparchus still sought to preserve appearances , and chose a reasonable ( to him ) geometric model to represent planetary motions mathematically . • Compilation of all Mathematical & Astronomical knowledge of his NN . • Known to PRP in Arabic translations WDT hailed PRP "" Al Magest "" ( "" DT Greatest "" ) . • Vastly influential work in medieval Europe after DT 11th century . Ptolemy introduced DT Equant , a geometric device to account for observed changes in a NN 's speed as PRP moved around DT NNP . ( Click on DT image to view at full scale [ Size : 6 Kb ] ) • DT Epicycle still moves about DT center of DT Deferent , but • Uniform circular motion about DT center of DT deferent is replaced by uniform angular motion about an off - center equant point . • Equants and eccentrics for all planets , DT Moon , and Sun • With only minor modifications , PRP provided accurate predictions of DT motions of DT planets , Sun , and Moon . PRP was to prevail virtually unchallenged for nearly 1500 NNS ."

Just few NNS ago PRP MD have been turquoise from where I am sitting and only cumulus clouds might have hung low , seeming almost tangible behind DT ridges on DT other side of DT lake . DT rest of DT open dome MD have been nothing but solid aqua - blue , a shade WDT is almost beyond description . I fell in love with DT sky when PRP came here to live nearly ten NNS ago , deeply , crazy in love . On February 14th , I sat in DT front row at a conference on geoengineering at DT 2015 AAAS meeting in San Jose , California . I watched a panel of NNS and CD law professor each take his turn in a sort of performance WDT made no sense to me . On his way in , Alan Robock of Rutgers University went out of his way to say to a group of activists in front of DT convention center , “ I do n't VB what PRP 're all protesting . PRP 's nothing but NN vapor . ” This is DT man who , in 2008 , wrote “ 20 Reasons Why Geoengineering MD Be a Bad Idea ” . During DT conference he made PRP a point to say IN DT reason those of PRP in Northern California notice these trails so much more than other NNS and VBP PRP are a problem is because our sky is so blue . Dear Alan : Our sky was “ so blue ” . DT trails PRP claim are nothing but NN vapor are spreading out all over our sky and PRP 're not only dimming DT sun but are completely changing its color to a silvery blue . What I 'm struggling to understand is why NNS MD VB along with this . As I type , EX are almost 20,000 signatures on a petition I wrote several months ago , and those NNS all see what isreally happening . Their comments are from DT heart . PRP miss DT sun . PRP miss their natural sky . Their NNS have breathing problems . For me , looking at this smeared mess over my head feels DT same as when I am in a place of natural beauty and DT rocks are sprayed with graffiti or EX is trash on DT ground . No matter what DT words are or DT wrapper WDT has been left behind , PRP says , “ Disrespectful man was here . ” Who MD invent a concept IN deliberately spraying pollution into DT sky ? What kind of mind conceives an idea this horrible and says to someone , “ Hey , PRP MD intentionally pollute DT sky and make fake clouds so IN PRP can VB on polluting DT atmosphere with greenhouse gases for as long as PRP VBP . PRP MD even control DT weather ! ” What kind of NNS sit around DT table in DT planning room , nod their heads and reply , “ Say , DT 's a swell idea ! ” ? Have n't these NNS ever gone hiking ? Have PRP ever paddled a canoe ? Are PRP NNS who do n't VB DT silky feel of a baby 's hair beneath their fingertips ? Are PRP NNS who do n't see DT beauty in a child 's smile when he crosses a finish line and can still breathe ? Or is DT feeling of a paycheck being pressed into their palms DT only thing WDT makes their heart race a little faster , or pulls their smile a little broader ? PRP is a beautiful plan , really . First , PRP were all programmed to VB IN only those who join DT clubs , play for DT team , fight for our country , or drink with DT frat are “ normal ” . Those of PRP who crouched in DT woods , dug in DT dirt , collected pine cones , insects and objects other than shells on DT beach were DT weirdos . Most human beings attend ceremonies , follow traditions , perform rituals , stand in line , and fail to question because DT is what has been expected of PRP all our lives . DT television writes our script for existence in DT modern NN . DT newscasters tell PRP only what PRP 're permitted to say , and PRP are programmed to blindly accept only DT which is “ officially ” published by certain “ credible ” institutions or academic authors . Enter DT word WDT separates DT crowd : “ Chemtrails ” . PRP is pulled out IN a hand puppet to create social exclusion . PRP manufactures instant division : DT NNP Team and DT Them Team of DT NN 's skywatchers . DT NNP Team thinks what is being done to DT sky is insanity . PRP are watching DT trees die from chemicals and lack of full sunlight . Some of PRP are aware of DT raspy laugh or hoarse - sounding cough WDT had its onset when DT spraying started above PRP . For others , DT NN consequences have been worse . DT Them Team is a mystery to me . Were PRP forced to wear bow ties at private school somewhere , to stand in line just a little too quietly when PRP wanted to run around on DT playground instead ? When PRP were NNS , were PRP forced into submission by an overly stern parent ? Or are PRP just plain insane ? Who MD do this to our NN or VB along with doing PRP to DT only NNP PRP have ? Who MD turn a blind eye to what is happening and instantly tack on DT title “ Chemtrailer ” to every person who questions DT blatant mess WDT is intentionally being created daily by jet aircraft ? What kind of person MD publish a NNS 's book , a movie , a photograph , or a computer game WDT subtly sells this concept by incorporating PRP into DT artwork ? Who are these NNS , and how in DT name of God did I end up on DT same NN with them ? Several times a day , I VBP out and walk DT circumference of my above - ground swimming pool , looking for bumble bees to save from drowning in DT NN . Most of DT NN I scoop them up with my bare hands because PRP seem to somehow VB I 'm RB to help . I place them as gently as I can onto DT lavender plants and hope PRP can hear DT others and recover . If PRP are faltering , I tell them PRP must try harder and I nudge them to flutter their wings so PRP will dry sooner . PRP are a gift . PRP are something DT Them Team MD not understand . PRP were something I overlooked most of my life until PRP disappeared . In DT spring of 2013 , only a couple of weeks after I saw DT first group of jets spray an aerosol haze above my house , DT bumble bees vanished . Every other insect on our property soon disappeared as well . By August of DT NN , DT pool was devoid of insects and DT porch light glowed moth - free , a ghostly reminder of what was being destroyed . I knew PRP was DT trails . But I am just a “ chemtrailer ” . What do I VB ? DT Them Team has used their social exclusion tactics to draw a line in DT sand so PRP can VB on about DT business of lying or denying . I VBP PRP 's some of both , and I VBP DT NNS on DT team have JJ different agendas . By pulling out DT label and plastering PRP around , some of them VBP to stand on a tiny pedestal and do what I call DT Academic Chuckle when PRP deem PRP appropriate . PRP VBP to publicly make fun of thousands of NNS who have eyes PRP trust and NNS PRP are concerned about . PRP VBP to destroy DT NN while pretending PRP 're saving PRP , and hundreds of NNS are VBG right along with them by not having DT scrotal fortitude to stand up to them and their ready - made label . ( Politicians are included in this long list of cowards . ) Geoengineering is happening . DT NN is manipulating DT weather . Very wealthy NNS and corrupt corporations have a tremendous amount to gain from pushing California into a drought . Giant pharmaceutical companies are making millions on NNS with depressed immune systems and asthma . Welcome to America , everyone . Land of DT oblivious , home of DT cowardly . This is why DT Them Team is getting away with PRP . NNS VBP to be part of something . PRP do n't VB to face social exclusion . PRP do n't VB to be ridiculed . PRP do n't VB to hear DT Academic Chuckle and be on DT wrong side of PRP . But EX was a NN when most of DT NN thought DT NN was flat and NNS who thought PRP was round were laughed at , a NN when Galileo was punished for his views on heliocentrism . Rachel Carson was publicly ridiculed when she warned of DT dangers of DDT . Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was scorned for his suggestion IN doctors wash their hands in a sanitizing solution before delivering babies in order to prevent childbed fever ; and Louis Pasteur 's ideas were met with skepticism . What aspect of DT human mind makes PRP so resistant to JJ concepts , so unable to rise to DT challenge of facing existing problems ? How hard is PRP to look up at DT sky and see what is happening ? How hard is PRP to see IN DT trees are dying ? If I cared what other NNS thought , I MD n't be writing this . Oh , sure , PRP all do to an extent , but EX are some of PRP who were just born to pour DT poison Kool - Aid down DT drain and say , “ Not for me ! ” When I was four NNS old , I went to nursery school in a section of DT First NNP Methodist Church , and I knew what was beyond DT door in DT baby room . PRP led into DT rest of DT building and ultimately to DT church sanctuary . Every so often , my grandmother MD drag me reluctantly to Sunday services and feed me pink mint candy to keep me quiet , so I remembered seeing DT sanctuary with its silky blue cushions and looming stained - glass windows . I was determined to find my way to PRP . I convinced about four other kids to join DT caper . PRP sneaked through DT nursery room door and skipped through DT dark warren of hallways until PRP came to DT light , and PRP exploded with giggles in DT lofty , enormous room . Without a congregation , PRP had a beautiful dreamlike quality and PRP never occurred to me IN I was breaking a rule . I only knew IN I was on adventure and PRP had reached our destination . DT punishment turned out to be better than DT crime itself , for PRP were sentenced to help prepare lunches in DT deepest , darkest part of DT church with Mrs. Brezina for a week straight . She was DT kindest jailer imaginable and her kitchen was tucked into a forgotten grotto WDT was as interesting as PRP was neglected . Those of PRP who recruit others to sneak off to find a beautiful place WDT resides in our memory are DT kinds of NNS who do n't join clubs . PRP follow only rules WDT matter and PRP step out of line . Out of curiosity PRP play with DT NN squirter in DT dentist chair when nobody is looking . PRP VBP for ourselves . PRP became accustomed long ago to being called names because PRP 've always been different , so as a tactic of psychological manipulation , calling PRP names does n't really work . DT Them Team can try as hard as PRP wants to . PRP 's not VBG to back PRP down and make PRP VB , “ Good heavens , someone is disdainfully lumping PRP into a category so PRP 'd better shut up and VB on about DT business of fitting in . ” Did Rachel Carson try to fit in ? Semmelweis ? Galileo ? No , PRP did what PRP thought was right despite extreme opposition by their peers . PRP might not have had happy endings , but PRP all played a significant role in exposing DT truth . EX was brilliance in contorting DT word “ chemtrails ” so IN PRP immediately triggers an emotional response in certain NNS . PRP has bought DT Them Team NN . In just two syllables PRP creates an obstacle . For NNS who believe in DT established order of things , still believe our NN is working for DT greater good , and do n't VB to buck DT system , EX is DT word IN a comfortable old jacket ready to be slipped on to protect them from DT truth : “ DT chemtrail NNS must be wrong because PRP are associated with a detestable word WDT makes them sound nuts . ” And then PRP pull DT jacket around them a little tighter . PRP is a convenient way out . Score CD for DT Them Team . PRP just got more NN to carry on with their nasty deeds . Human behavior is baffling . When did NNS become so out of touch with DT natural NN IN PRP can't look up at DT sky and see IN things are just not right ? When did seemingly intelligent NNS lose their ability to use reason ? NNS are “ proposing ” DT very thing PRP are witnessing , and yet NNS are letting themselves be manipulated by CD simple two - syllable word so IN PRP are completely unable to see DT truth hiding in plain sight . DT reality is , if our planetary situation is so dire IN spraying a layer of pollution into DT atmosphere is our only hope , NNS need to VB . And if spraying aerosols into DT atmosphere is putting millions of dollars into DT pockets of big businesses and allowing companies to keep polluting for DT almighty dollar , NNS need to VB . If our governments are manipulating DT weather , whatever DT reason , NNS need to VB . EX is no PRP Team and Them Team . PRP are all riding on a relatively small ship in a very big universe , and PRP 's dangerously close to sinking and taking PRP with PRP . DT human tendency to VB EX is a big fix , IN PRP can pull out all DT stops in DT end and save DT day , is just wrong . PRP can't . PRP 's NN for everyone to face what is happening because , at this point , DT truth is our only hope ."

Rubino explains , “ DT coming monetary reset and what DT means for gold and what DT means for DT rest of DT JJ financial system , PRP do n’t need a war to bring DT about because PRP are making enough financial mistakes WDT will VB PRP RB in no NN flat now without geopolitical turmoil . If PRP add a big war in DT Middle East into DT equation , then anything can happen . A scenario right now DT is very , very feasible is PRP start shooting in DT Middle East and Russia and NNP is on DT other side of this in CD way or another . PRP help Iran , and PRP have our allies helping PRP , and PRP start using these next generation weapons WDT are breathtakingly powerful . Nobody has any idea what ’s VBG to happen when PRP start throwing these things at each other . . . . Oil spikes to $ 100 – $ 150 per barrel , and DT tips DT already extremely fragile JJ financial system over DT edge . So , PRP VBP DT ‘ Greater Depression ’ or DT monetary reset or a hyperinflation or whatever PRP VBP sooner rather than later . PRP ’s a disaster for everybody when PRP happens DT way . ” Rubino says DT monetary masters “ tried to fix DT financial system but MD not do PRP . ” Rubino says , “ If PRP VBP PRP are beyond DT point of no return financially as an individual , PRP borrow as much money as PRP can , and then VB bankrupt . . . . Governments in DT NN are starting to do DT now or behaving DT way . . . . EX is nothing PRP can do to fix DT system . In DT U.S. , PRP tried to fix DT system and scale back and PRP found out DT is impossible . DT central bank in DT U.S. cannot raise interest rates without DT economy collapsing . . . . So , PRP basically gave up . . . . PRP are printing a lot of currency electronically and dumping PRP into DT banking system . . . . DT consequence for DT currency is to make PRP less valuable NN after NN . . . then PRP VBP DT crackup boom . . . where NNS just lose faith in DT currency because PRP see DT NN is VBG to make PRP less valuable NN after NN . So , EX is no point in holding DT currency as savings . PRP spend PRP as fast as PRP VBP PRP . ” In closing , Rubino says , “ PRP have entered a JJ stage which feels IN CD of DT end stages of this process — when governments just give up and do n’t even pretend to try and control their finances anymore . Well , PRP are RB . DT ’s when PRP will be clear to everybody DT is DT case , and then your gold goes through DT roof . DT investment thesis ends with PRP loading up on precious metals and then riding DT inflation and / or monetary reset WDT has to happen because of past mistakes . . . . DT nightmare scenario is if PRP are already having a financial crisis and then PRP have a war with NNP and Russia , PRP ’s unimaginable .

""_''","As this decade comes to an end , EX have been quite a few moments WDT NNS have hoped and prayed had never happened . While these ' foot - in - mouth ' moments have numbered in DT hundreds and thousands in this decade itself , PRP 've rounded up ten of DT choicest moments , some of them quite embarrassing for those concerned . This list of ten moments includes not just personalities in India and across DT NN , but RB certain events WDT have had a number of consequences for those involved . Here is a list of this decade 's most ' foot - in - mouth ' moments , in descending order : Flat - earthers are those who believe , simply , IN DT NN is not round , but flat . No matter DT evidence given , flat - earthers do not recognise DT NN to be an oblate - spheroid , to use DT terminology NNS have given to DT NN 's shape . This movement has been around for a long NN , but has grown in popularity with DT rise of social NN and NN theories . DT movement has RB attracted a few celebrities to ridicule or support DT movement . In 2017 , a rapper from DT NNP started a GoFundMe page to crowdfund satellites to prove DT NN was flat . 9. Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan 's goof - ups on ' Koffee With Karan ' Bollywood celebrities Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan probably wished PRP MD have brushed up on their general knowledge before slipping up on filmmaker Karan Johar 's show , ' Koffee With Karan ' . On being asked who DT NNP of DT country was , Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan VBD ' Prithviraj Chavan ' and ' Manmohan Singh ' respectively . Both celebrities were massively trolled online for their answers and were DT laughing stock of social NN users for quite a long NN . 8. Fyre Festival and DT ' sad ' but viral cheese sandwich DT Fyre Festival promised to be a modern - day Woodstock , with DT festival 's organisers doubling down on DT lavish promise of a grand music festival on an exotic island filled with food , drinks , music , luxurious bungalows to stay in and famous supermodels . Rich NNS who MD afford DT extravagant price tag , upwards of $ 10,000 , flocked to DT island , located in DT Bahamas , only to be greeted with torrential rain a day before DT festival was to kick off , small tents with dirty mattresses and ... two breads with a cheese slice , tomato slices and lettuce leaves for food . A photo of DT ' sad ' cheese sandwich went viral on social NN and marked DT beginning of DT end of festival . After a user posted DT photo of DT cheese sandwich , NN of DT disaster WDT was DT Fyre Festival broke out and went viral on social NN . CD of DT festival 's organisers Billy McFarland , was convicted of fraud , while DT other , famous rapper Ja Rule , distanced himself from DT festival . JJ soft drink brand Pepsi hoped to capitalise on DT anti-establishment fervour in 2017 , with an advertisement featuring celebrity socialite Kendall Jenner cutting across protestors and offering a policeman a can of Pepsi . With DT ' Black Lives Matter ' protests WDT had sparked in DT NNP , DT ad provoked an outcry and was widely derided on social NN . Bernice King , DT daughter of civil rights activist Martin Luther King , wrote a scathing response to DT ad on Twitter : "" If only Daddy MD have known about DT power of # Pepsi , "" with a picture of her father being pushed by a police officer . Union Minister Piyush Goyal became DT centre of attention on social NN in September this NN while commenting on DT NN of DT economy . Mr Goyal , while defending DT NN 's handling of DT economy , VBD "" If PRP 're looking at a five trillion dollar economy , DT country will have to grow at 12 % . Today PRP 's growing at 6 % . Do n't VB into those maths . Those maths have never helped Einstein discover gravity ... If PRP 'd only gone by structured formulae and what was past knowledge , I do n't VB EX MD have been any innovation in this NN "" . Social NN was quick to point out IN PRP was Isaac Newton and not Albert Einstein who discovered gravity . After being derided for DT remarks on social NN , DT minister VBD IN some "" sought to remove DT context , pick up CD line and create a very mischievous narrative . "" ' Alternative facts ' was a phrase famously coined by NNP NNP Donald NNP 's then White House advisor Kellyanne Conway . DT phrase was coined after NNP 's former White House press secretary Sean Spicer 's alleged false statement on DT number of NNS who had attended NNP 's inauguration ceremony . Conway used DT term to justify Spicer 's claim IN a large number of NNS had attended DT ceremony , whereas photographic evidence proved otherwise . Donald NNP has been notorious for his comments on NN NN , including his recent barbs aimed at NN NN activist , 16 - NN - old Greta Thunberg . "" DT concept of JJ NN was created by and for DT Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive , "" NNP had tweeted in 2012 . In another tweet , NNP VBD IN JJ NN was needed because PRP was freezing and snowing in NNP York . Elon Musk stoked controversy last NN , when DT incident involving several NNS being trapped inside a cave in Thailand made headlines DT NN over , saw DT tech billionaire play a role in rescue attempts as well . Following a disagreement with Vernon Unsworth , a British diver involved in rescuing DT NNS , Elon Musk in a tweet , called him a "" pedo guy "" . Unsworth had described Musk 's proposal to build a mini-submarine to rescue DT NNS as a "" PR stunt "" . DT comment has proved to be costly for Musk , with an ensuing lawsuit as well as several clarifications issued by him . As recently as this month , Musk 's attorney Alex Spiro VBD "" pedo guy "" meant "" creepy old guy "" in South Africa , in a bid at damage control . Former Junior Education Minister Satyapal Singh had last NN claimed IN DT theory of evolution put forth by naturalist Charles Darwin was "" scientifically wrong "" . "" Ever since humans came to NNP , PRP have always been humans , "" he had VBN , adding IN "" Nobody , including our ancestors , have VBN or written IN PRP ever saw an ape turning into a human being . No book PRP have read or DT tales told to PRP by our grandparents had any such mention "" . DT comments provoked a sharp reaction from Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who in a harsh rebuke to his partymen , had VBN IN "" PRP make mistakes and give ' masala ' to DT NN ... as if PRP are great social NNS and experts to analyse issues ... DT moment PRP see a camera PRP start speaking . So this half - baked stuff is picked up "" . DT Indian Army in April this NN , tweeted IN PRP had spotted "" mysterious footprints of DT mythical beast Yeti "" , RB known as DT ' abominable snowman ' . DT army shared photos on Twitter claiming IN a mountaineering expedition team had found DT Yeti's "" mysterious footprints measuring 32X15 inches "" . In DT images , DT prints appear to be of a single foot . NNS soon called for more credible proof before citing claims over DT mythical beast , with CD scientist telling NDTV IN DT finding by DT army be "" best left as amateur speculation WDT needs to be debated further "" . Social NN did n't take too kindly over DT army 's claim either , with several users mocking PRP online . "" MD n't PRP guys call a single animal expert before posting this ? "" CD person wrote , with another asking if PRP was a "" prank "" . Yet another user mocked DT image of DT single footprint , saying IN DT beast "" travels by jumping . """

Louie Franz and Jamie Mathew Sutherland were having dinner in DT NNP Zealand town of Queenstown and arguing about DT NN ’s true shape when PRP made a $ 10,000 NZD ( £ 5,000 ) wager about who was right . Mr Franz – a believer in DT widely discredited flat NNP NN theory – VBD PRP shook hands on DT bet about whether DT NN was flat before Mr Sutherland – a believer in NN – immediately demanded payment .

I_PRP rest_VBP my_PRP$ caboose_NN ._.","I 'm always amazed what simpletons some brainy folks are . Once PRP regular folks leave college for DT real NN , PRP realize college graduates with numerous awards and diplomas are only smarter by degrees but not necessarily wiser . And common sense is not all RB common . And Men of Letters often have no practical experience -- aside from reading letters from other men IN themselves . DT average farmer working his field must calculate DT gallons per hour his diesel tractor consumes . Applied NN rather than theoretical NN . If he tills a square mile of land , 640 acres , he realizes his tractor engine consumes more fuel at a higher RPM and DT engine works harder but nor more efficiently , and so he sets his speed according . Applied NN again when DT farmer applies PRP in DT field . Recently , some British poll determined a linguistic professor at MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology - was DT smartest intellectual in DT NN . Allegedly DT guy has written a couple hundred books . This fellow was so deep , CD of DT "" most cited "" authorities in DT NN , IN whatever he VBD entered DT realm of fact . Funny how an institution - Yale or MIT - can build a reputation for braininess but closer inspection indicates IN lofty reputation is wholly undeserved . DT average farmer tilling his land appears smarter by comparison . He applies his knowledge in DT field , rather than simply positing theories WDT hold little merit when examined closely . Now MIT , IN Yale University , is a huge , NN funded and privately supported , NN tank . Sort of IN DT American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) or AIPAC , a couple of institutes WDT allegedly foster friendly foreign relations but which any objective observer MD be hard pressed to explain just how PRP benefit DT average American taxpayer . Likewise , Yale University : College of Criminal Arts , ranks among DT most prestigious universities for brainy NNS but when PRP consider DT yokels and hucksters and scalawags who have matriculated RB "" both Bush and NNP clans as well as DT doofus Kerry -- any objective observer might deduce Yale 's reputation for braininess was wholly undeserved . Awhile back , a number of MIT brains , including DT institute 's top "" intellectual "" deduced IN 911 was simply what DT NN claimed PRP was : An act of terrorism wholly perpetrated by fanatics from DT Middle East . Indeed , DT top intellectual authored a book of his brainy interviews on DT subject entitled "" 9 - 11 . "" A hasty little compilation , DT booklet hardly mentioned any of details of DT attack . Instead , ignoring basic Core Evidence , "" 9 - 11 "" blamed American policies for DT attack , but without mentioning DT more intellectually challenging possibility : DT attack was wholly or partially DT brainchild of "" intellectuals "" much closer to home . Immediately after 911 , a number of structural engineers gathered at DT NN - funded institute of MIT and - surprise , surprise - affirmed DT NN version of events about 911 . "" DT main culprits in bringing DT famously lofty buildings down , PRP concluded , were DT two intensely hot infernos , "" summarized Scientific American writer , Steve Ashley . "" DT NNP Trade Center was never designed for DT massive explosions nor DT intense jet fuel fires WDT came next - a key design omission , "" according to Eduardo Kausel , M.I.T. professor of civil and environmental engineering and panel member . DT towers collapsed , allegedly , after DT kerosene jet fuel fire weakened high tensile steel . These "" scientific "" conclusions then appeared in DT Scientific American magazine : NNP & Technology at Scientific American , "" When DT Twin Towers Fell "" . Unfortunately , little of DT structural steel in DT WTC was examined , however , by DT learned structural engineers . Beams and girders were instead shipped overseas for hasty recycling . Nor did any structural engineer comment on actual photos of DT alleged "" inferno . "" Might have been difficult for them to explain how a woman Walked Through Steel - Melting Fire . Now this MIT symposium , reminded me of a meeting of DT Flat - NNP society , where believers hoisted their yardsticks above their heads and proclaimed PRP , d measured DT surrounding countryside inch - by - inch and found PRP flat , thus DT NNP was flat . DT MIT structural engineers concluded their scientific symposium almost by a show of hands , or popular vote ! "" Given DT lack of firm conclusions regarding how DT collapses occurred , ( since all DT evidence was conveniently destroyed ) DT M.I.T. panel participants asked their audience to consider various theories PRP put forth . "" In short , PRP admitted , after expending hours of hot air , IN PRP didn, t VB what - DT - hell happened ! So instead of applying hard NN , PRP applied theory . Since their NN had hastily carted off all DT factual , hard evidence WDT might have conflicted with "" scientific "" theory , PRP drew conclusions based on conjecture ! So , instead of building a forty - foot , scale model ( 1/25 scale ) of DT boxy skyscrapers , WTC - 1 , WTC - 2. WTC - 7 , and shooting an aluminum scale model airplane into DT upper floors of building 1 & 2 at 400 miles per hour , and setting fire to DT section with a few gallons ( more or less ) of kerosene , PRP simply dissected DT blueprints , inspected some computerized images of floor joints , hypothesized IN "" intensely hot infernos "" caused joist connections to fail , and delivered their conclusions to DT modern Flat NNP society at MIT via DT pages of DT Scientific American . Morons In Training . Any metallurgist from a community college , with a modicum of field research and a curiosity about how things work , MD construct a ten foot ( 1/100 scale ) model of DT WTC - 7 , set a few smoldering fires in DT lower floors and film DT results . And absolutely nothing MD happen ! Not today , not tomorrow and not next NN . Instead , DT scale model of a 47 - story , steel skyscraper , ( WTC - 7 ) , WDT allegedly collapsed due to DT "" stress of intense heat "" MD remain as inflexible as DT gray matter in DT brains of those MIT NNS . Unfortunately , our Morons In Training at MIT , which is only another NN - funded NN tank , feel no need to conduct honest , real NN tests , since PRP do not live in DT real NN . PRP live in a NN of illusions and NN - funded , computer - generated propaganda . Pathetic . Philosopher and skeptic , Douglas Herman authored DT definitive philosophical - suspense novel , DT Guns of Dallas and writes for Rense . WHAT'S IN PRP FOR ME ? Which is DT standard call of all college students these days . Let 's begin with DT first question , "" So What ? "" So what is DT big deal here ? Is this something which is JJ ? College students , even DT brains , have no experience . This is true of all college grads , Ph.D. , MBA , M.O.U.S.E. , Physics , whatever . PRP 's DT experience which makes them VB everything . PRP 's DT experience which comes after exposure to DT reality of practicing their trade , using their degree . A college degree , no matter DT size or shape , presents DT basic knowledge base upon which a man or woman MD learn from experience . Nothing JJ here . OK , OK , so I 'll VB to DT point of others hanging on every word . Later . For DT NN being , let 's discuss question number two . Who Cares ? Not me . PRP see , I 've had to deal with JJ a degreed primadonna during my career . When I consulted for a firm recently , EX was a very brilliant MBA assigned by DT firm 's owners and board of directors , to my client . He was cocky , he was arrogant and he was almost always wrong . After a period of perhaps nine or so months , every decision I made , he countered . So , I resigned . DT NN of DT firm called me back and told me I had full authority within DT purview of my field , which was marketing . OK fine . DT business more than doubled in less than two NNS . But did I make DT "" kid "" as PRP called him , look bad ? Hell no . I made DT decisions , and I required IN he , DT kid , implement them . He learned . I learned . DT owners learned . Everyone was happy . I met DT kid in court about seven NNS ago . PRP were both paid expert witnesses . I went on first . I waited with bated breath for DT kid to counter every darned thing I VBD . I was both surprised and happy to hear him agree with everything to which I testified . What 's in PRP for me ? Easy . DT 's DT cry of DT JJ college grad . When I graduated with a degree in EE and got my first job at Grumman in 1966 , I was paid DT then high salary of almost ten thousand dollars . Yikes . Today , DT kids are paid minimum four times DT if PRP 're in DT top ten percentile of their graduating class . Add a few more degrees and PRP will , with a Ph.D. in EE , pull down over a hundred thousand dollars in their first job . Can PRP imagine what PRP 'll be earning when this country goes to hell in a hand basket ? Give PRP six or seven NNS and these kids will be making up to three and a half yards a * week ! * A yard being a thousand dollars . Now let PRP VB back to DT writer 's main point . PRP give these kids credence . Well , DT 's quite so . But those who give these kids credence are * not* in DT mainstream of practical application of DT kids ' expertise . PRP are likely in academia . Or PRP are in awe of those in academia . What 's DT point ? Well , hell 's bell 's PRP 's right theren staring PRP in DT face if PRP just look . Ooops ! PRP will require DT services of a mirror . I almost forgot . Here , do this in remembrance of me ... Take a mirror , a hand mirror . Make IN PRP are VBG to inspect your hair . PRP VBP , for fallout and stuff ? OK . Now look right on top of DT head of yours . What do PRP see ? I VBP what I see . I see a point . See my point ? Right RB on DT top of your head . Asked and answered , Your Honor . I rest my caboose ."

According to Disney , DT series centers around a teenage girl named Luz who “ discovers a portal to another realm where humans are not well - liked , and she must disguise herself in order to fit in at witch school . ” This realm , DT kids programming empire says , is referred to as “ Demon town , ” and in PRP Luz decides to live with a demon named Eda DT Owl Lady who ’s “ DT most powerful witch on DT Boiling Iles . ” Luz ’s character decides during CD of DT earlier episodes of DT show WDT , “ Someday , I ’m VBG to be just IN her ” – meaning Luz wants to grow up not to be an honorable human woman , but rather a demon witch IN Eda . DT purpose of this storyline , of course , is to teach NNS whose parents let them watch DT Disney Channel WDT being normal human beings is passé , and IN PRP ’s “ cool ” to discover portals WDT carry PRP off to hell to live with demons , witches , and even Satan himself . “ Folks , if PRP VBP this latest ‘ Owl House ’ show is just ‘ fantasy and fun ’ VB again , ” reads a commentary written by Deborah Bunting for CBN ( DT Christian Broadcasting Network ) . “ DT show tries to portray witchcraft as a positive tool to fight evil , ” she goes on to explains . “ DT ’s similar to what real - life witches have been promoting over DT past few NNS as PRP ’ve been putting hexes on NNP NNP and others in order to fight for their beliefs . ” Sponsored solution from DT NNP Ranger Store : DT Big Berkey NN filter removes almost 100 % of all contaminants using only DT power of gravity ( no electricity needed , works completely off - grid ) .

But how is PRP possible for PRP to zoom in from outer space to a point somewhere above DT rooftop of your house without bringing your desktop computer to a grinding halt ? DT main obstacle to a convincing three - diménsional skydive is data transfer . If CD were to download over DT Internet a CD - metre resolution image of DT entire NN PRP MD take 69 NNS with a 10 - megabit - per- second Internet connection , and 12,400 NNS with a standard 56 K modem . To slash DT amount of data PRP have to transmit across DT Internet , virtual globes such as Google NNP approximate DT sphere of DT NN 's surface with a polygon made up of flat tiles . DT further away your viewpoint is from DT surface , DT fewer tiles are needed to create DT illusion of roundness , and DT lower DT resolution of these tiles can be . As PRP zoom in , DT computer explodes each tile into smaller sub-tiles , each with higher resolution , and re-forms DT polygon into a ball . DT process continues as PRP zoom . This means IN DT virtual globe only has to download high - resolution data when DT viewer is actively zooming towards PRP . Virtual globes RB use another trick to speed <? xm - replace ?> things up further : a disk cache .

To find those opportunities , look at markets and performance under a microscope . For example , a large industrial company suffered stagnant growth until a highly granular market analysis identified 4,000 growth pockets with $ 10 billion in revenue potential . • Identify micro-segments of customers , geographic regions , and products where performance is increasing . • Invest resources ( R&D , advertising mix ) in areas with DT strongest growth momentum , and jettison low - growth areas . • Restructure your organization to focus on DT expanded number of growth priorities . For example , assign each micro-segment its own accountable leader . Some companies will need an executive team of 200 or more to lead JJ product clusters or geographic slivers . A closer look at how to grow your business through a more granular approach : Plot each of your company ’s $ 50 – $ 200 million growth opportunities ( “ pockets ” ) on a two - dimensional graph — a “ heat map . ” DT y - axis represents market growth ; DT x - axis , market share compared with competitors ’ . Use circles to represent each pocket , and color code them to indicate in which of your company ’s divisions or units DT opportunity lies ; size DT circles to show DT relative value of DT business your company currently does in each pocket . Once PRP ’ve used your heat map to gain a more detailed view of your business , start managing your business in a more granular way : Invest DT lion ’s share of your resources in DT areas with strong market share and growth . Draw on insights about where growth pockets will be , not where PRP are now ( for instance , GE announced IN by 2010 , PRP MD be investing $ 1.5 billion annually in renewable - NN businesses . ) Beef up your M&A capabilities so PRP can quickly move into a high - growth market space through a targeted acquisition . Jettison low - growth businesses in unattractive market spaces . Companies ’ usual inner circle ( CEO , unit heads , sales and functional leaders ) is n’t large enough to make all DT where - to - compete choices WDT arise every day . So devolve responsibility for DT pursuit of fine - grained opportunities to your 200 - plus top leaders . These individuals might lead product clusters , geographic slivers , or special initiatives . PRP ’ll focus your organization on important growth opportunities , while inspiring and motivating relatively small teams who ’ll develop a strong sense of ownership . But to manage DT resulting complexity , ensure members of your extended leadership team fully understand how their individual goals fit with DT company ’s strategic priorities . Make certain PRP ’re well versed in granular measurement approaches , such as DT market heat map . During regular operations reviews , push DT conversation beyond high - level financial and operating numbers for a business ’s multiple product lines and markets . Dig down into DT underlying drivers of growth and profitability in DT different component businesses . Ask questions such as : • How is each growth driver changing ? • How likely is each component business to win in its market ? • Do resources need to be reallocated ? • Is PRP NN to exit a market ?"

DT title was a play on his 2004 documentary “ Fahrenheit 9/11 ” WDT sought to expose mishandlings in NNP George W. Bush ’s White House following DT attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 . DT latest film , as Fox NNP previously reported , sought to do DT same to NNP NNP at a key NN for DT country : DT 2018 midterm elections . “ Fahrenheit 11/9 ” took in $ 3.1 million in 1,719 cinemas — a large debut for most documentaries but a fraction of DT $ 23.9 million opening of “ Fahrenheit 9/11 . ” DT film went on to make $ 222.4 million worldwide , a record for documentaries . Moore ’s JJ film , which examines DT rise of NNP and other developments IN DT NN crisis in his hometown of Flint , Mich . , had been predicted to open with $ 5 million to $ 8 million , but did n't even come close . This , despite a surge in success for documentaries at DT box office in DT past few months , including “ RBG , ” ‘‘ Wo n’t PRP Be My Neighbor ” and “ Three Identical Strangers . ” “ Fahrenheit 11/9 , ” DT first release from former Open Road chief executive Tom Ortenberg ’s JJ distributor , Briarcliff Entertainment , MD have decent weeks ahead leading up to DT November elections . ComScore ’s PostTrak survey found IN 82 percent of viewers gave PRP four out of five stars . PRP landed an “ A ” CinemaScore . “ Those who did see PRP really enjoyed PRP , ” VBD Paul Dergarabedian , senior NN analyst for comScore . “ NNS have VBN : Should PRP have gone limited ? Should PRP have gone wide ? I VBP PRP needed to VB PRP out RB nationwide with midterms six weeks away . But PRP ’s very easy to second - guess how to release a documentary IN this . PRP ’s CD of DT most difficult types of films to release . ” Last month , Moore , whose 2002 documentary “ Bowling for Columbine ” won an Oscar , made headlines when DT trailer for “ Fahrenheit 11/ 9 ” referred to NNP as “ DT last NN of DT NNP NNPS . ” DT anti-Trump filmmaker sat down with MSNBC ’s Chris Hayes , who asked Moore about DT bold claim . “ I VBP PRP ’s possible , absolutely . I VBP IN PRP have someone in DT White House who has no respect for DT rule of law , who dislikes democracy by an incredible degree , which does n’t make him really any RB much different from other billionaires or CEOs because their businesses are not democracies , ” Moore responded . Moore VBD NNS IN NNP “ rule by fiat ” and do n’t VB when other NNS have a voice in their decision - making . “ PRP RB VBP to take home DT bulk of DT money with them . So this is — putting somebody IN DT in charge of a democracy is a very dangerous thing , and especially , PRP ’s more dangerous with him because he has a complete lack of ideology , ” Moore told Hayes . DT gothic family fantasy “ DT House With a Clock in Its Walls ” exceeded expectations to debut with an estimated $ 26.9 million in ticket sales at DT weekend box office . PRP was easily DT biggest draw on a quiet weekend at North American movie theaters , where DT other JJ wide releases all disappointed or downright flopped . Dan Fogelman ’s “ Life Itself ” and DT home invasion thriller “ Assassination Nation ” both barely made a blip in nationwide release . Though Fogelman ’s “ This Is PRP ” is CD of TV ’s top-rated series , his “ Life Itself ” bombed with $ 2.1 million despite a starry cast including Olivia Wilde , Oscar Isaac and Antonio Banderas .

DT other thing I MD say , just more generally , in DT case of violent extremism and limiting those videos on DT platform , DT reason PRP ’s different than what PRP ’re talking about here is IN those [ ISIS ] videos took on a particular form . PRP were often designed for propaganda purposes and recruitment purposes . So PRP had things IN branding and logos , both visually and in terms of DT music PRP might use .

DT station will then have a large service area in which little fading is experienced . DT demand for information on DT design of such an aerial has given rise in recent NNS to some theoretical and experimental investigations on DT general properties of antennas used in radio transmitting stations . A JJ and useful contribution to DT NN of knowledge on this subject has recently been given by Prof. P. O. Pcdersen in a booklet published ( in English ) in Copenhagen ( “ Radiation from a Vertical Antenna over Flat Perfectly Conducting NNP . ” Pp. 49 + 35 figures . G. E. C. Gad : Vimmelskaftet 32 , Copenhagen . Kr. 6.00 ) . This work comprises a theoretical investigation of DT radiation characteristics of a vertical antenna over Hat perfectly conducting NN , having for its objective a determination of DT most suitable dimensions of DT antenna at DT JJ Copenhagen broadcasting station . DT theoretical results have been checked by measurements of DT distribution of DT current in DT antenna and of DT field intensity at various distances from DT station . To facilitate DT theoretical analysis , DT current distribution in DT transmitting antenna is in DT first case assumed to be sinusoidal , although PRP was known IN this is not valid in DT practical case . DT complete general formulas for DT radiated field for an antenna are obtained , and a most useful series of tables and graphs are provided , from which DT radiation resistance and DT distribution of DT radiated field in DT vertical plane MD be calculated for antenna ; of various dimensions ."

This is exemplified by multiple discoveries within DT realms of quantum physics , parapsychology , and more — discoveries WDT have challenged ( and continue to challenge ) DT current framework of accepted scientific knowledge . This kind of shift in ideology has happened JJ times over DT course of our history ; when DT NN instantaneously became round from flat , DT majority of NNS were in disbelief and labelled DT JJ theory ’s proponents as blasphemers . Some great examples of NN WDT challenge these current and long held belief systems include : quantum entanglement , studies which examine DT role of consciousness on physical systems ( IN DT quantum double slit experiment ) , placebo studies , distant healing , and more . Another great example is teleportation , as several interesting findings within this field seem to be ( at least partly ) turning NN fiction into NN fact . DT title asserts IN he teleported DNA . PRP seems , as with other “ fringe ” topics when PRP comes to NN , phenomena IN this receives harsh criticism and resistance from a still decent sized part of NN . DT being VBN , did he really teleport DNA ? Given his reputation and credibility , combined with all of DT studies done in various types of teleportation , DT black budget and more , I am VBG to give him DT benefit of DT doubt . Nobel Prize winning scientist Luc Montagnier , previously known for his work on HIV and AIDS , claims to have demonstrated IN DNA can be generated from its teleported “ quantum imprint . ” This is a discovery WDT , were DT scientific community to VB on board , MD represent “ DT most significant experiments performed in DT past 90 NNS , demanding re-evaluation of DT whole conceptual framework of modern chemistry , ” ( source ) according to theoretical chemist Jeff Reimers of DT University of Sydney , Australia . In DT experiment , two adjacent but physically separate test tubes were placed within a copper coil and subjected to a very low frequency electromagnetic field of 7 hertz . DT apparatus was isolated from NNP ’s natural magnetic field so EX was no interference . CD tube contained a fragment of DNA ( approximately 100 bases long ) and DT second NN contained nothing but NN . ( source ) ( source ) ( source ) ( source ) After approximately 17 hours , DT gene fragment ( according to Montagnier ) was recovered from both tubes , even though PRP should have just contained NN . Although Montagnier ’s claims have received harsh criticism from various NNS , EX was a general consensus IN his results should be investigated further . For example , Giuseppe Vitiello , of DT University of Salemo in Italy , is confident IN DT experiment is reliable . Greg Scholes , from DT University of Toronto , Canada , who last NN demonstrated IN quantum effects occur in plants , VBD IN “ DT biological experiments do seem intriguing , and I MD n’t dismiss them . ” ( source ) Today , numerous teleportation breakthroughs have been made . CD example comes from DT work of Professor Rainer Blatt at DT University of Innsbruck . He and his colleagues were successfully able to perform teleportation on atoms for DT first NN . Their work was published in DT journal Nature . ( source ) Another NN , published by a team of University of Queensland physicists in DT journal Nature in 2013 , demonstrated successful teleportation with solid NN systems . ( source ) This is a process by which quantum information can be transmitted from CD place to another without sending a physical carrier of information . This is made possible through DT phenomenon of entanglement . A team from DT Joint Quantum Institute ( JQI ) at DT University of Maryland ( UMD ) and DT University of Michigan has succeeded in teleporting a quantum NN directly from CD atom to another over a substantial distance . ( source ) EX are different categories of teleportation . Another types of teleportation apart from quantum is psychic , which is DT conveyance of persons or inanimate objects by psychic means . “ PRP became known to myself , along with several colleagues both inside and outside of NN , IN anomalous teleportation has been scientifically investigated and separately documented by DT Department of Defense . ” ( source ) – Eric Davis , Ph.D , FBIS A paper published in DT NNP ’s Republic of NNP ( PRC ) in September 1981 , in DT journal Ziran Zazhi ( Nature Journal ) , reported IN “ gifted NNS ” were able to cause DT teleportation of small , physical objects from CD place to another . Objects included watches , horseflies , other insects , radio micro-transmitters , photosensitive paper and more . DT paper , titled “ Some Experiments on DT Transfer of Objects Performed by Unusual Abilities of DT Human Body ” ( Shuhuang et al. , 1981 ) , reveals IN participants never touched DT objects beforehand . DT experiments were done under both blind and double - blind conditions , and DT researchers involved came from various colleges and sectors of DT Department of Defense . Furthermore , NNS have conducted studies on NNS in DT lab which produced remarkable results , observing NNS describe physical objects WDT had been hidden in a remote location . ( source ) DT list of strange things reported in DT NN of NN is never ending , and I believe DT ‘ politicization ’ of academia and publications , as well as DT ‘ black budget ‘ NN , are important things to VB about when PRP comes to DT NN of NN , what research gets published , and what our minds are willing to explore – regardless of how hard PRP might be to accept ."

Murphy explains , “ EX are negative interest rates and low interest rates WDT just keep staying down RB , and supposedly things are really good . Look at our Dow at all - NN highs , and yet something is really wrong . Of course , this fits into DT GATA premise on this whole thing . EX ’s a lot of quantitative easing ( money printing ) and propping up of DT markets , and PRP ’s on very shaky ground . DT plug MD be pulled at any NN . . . . With interest rates where PRP are and debt growing all over DT place , DT reasons to be in gold are off DT charts . ” Murphy says “ silver is Kryptonite to central bankers ” because EX is little supply to use in DT cartel ’s suppression game . Murphy says , “ PRP mention DT word Kryptonite and DT key is what silver is doing . PRP is an extraordinary situation right now . . . . PRP seems to me IN , this NN , silver is in play . . . . DT is this big money talking on DT JPMorgan crowd and their game . PRP are gradually moving in for what I VBP is VBG to be CD of DT biggest market moves in history , and DT is silver VBG to $ 50 ( per ounce ) and then a $ 100 ( per ounce ) . Basically , PRP ’s because supply is drying up . . . . Where is all this supply coming from WDT this JPMorgan crowd has been feeding DT market with , and I VBP PRP are hitting DT wall with PRP . I VBP this big money knows what ’s VBG on , and PRP are quietly moving in . DT ’s DT reason silver has been trading IN PRP has . $ 18.50 was a key number . DT was DT completion of a big base . . . . DT next big key is to take out $ 20.50 , but DT real number is $ 21 . If PRP gets above $ 21 , PRP ’s VBG to start trading chaotically with volatile action on DT upside . DT market move is VBG to be historic . ” Murphy has long charged EX was suppression of gold and silver prices and has been proven 100 % correct . He now charges , “ DT real key for this gold cartel , as PRP call PRP , is DT suppression of DT gold price . PRP realized a long NN ago PRP MD n’t have a dichotomy between DT silver and gold . So , PRP got involved in DT silver market ( to suppress DT price ) to make gold look IN PRP should be doing what PRP is . DT problem is PRP are running out of physical silver to keep DT price down . . . . Eventually , PRP are VBG to VB a commercial signal failure in silver , which means these so - called commercials , which is a misnomer because PRP are not commercials , PRP ’re gold cartel trying to keep DT silver price down . PRP VBP when PRP lose control of silver , and PRP gets to $ 21 ( per ounce ) , PRP will be DT end of their gold suppression scheme . . . . PRP will be a gradual process because DT price of silver is VBG to VB bonkers . PRP will show what PRP have been doing all these NNS . I VBP PRP are finally reaching a tipping point . . . . DT death knell to DT gold cartel is DT lack of supply of silver to keep DT price down . . . . I VBP PRP are VBG to see DT double top of $ 50 be taken out and VB to at least $ 100 per ounce and maybe a lot more . I VBP PRP ’s VBG to move up faster than anybody can imagine . . . . Gold is VBG to move to some big number RB . . . . If gold kept pace with inflation , PRP MD be double what PRP is today . ” Join Greg Hunter as he goes CD - on - CD with Bill Murphy , Chairman and co-founder of GATA .

In a statement on Wednesday , DT National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , which is conducting DT NN , VBD preliminary data show patients who received remdesivir recovered faster than similar patients who received placebo . DT finding — although difficult to fully characterize without full , detailed data for DT NN — MD represent DT first treatment shown to improve outcomes in patients infected with DT NN WDT put DT JJ economy in a standstill and killed at least 218,000 NNS worldwide . During an appearance alongside NNP NNP in DT Oval Office , Anthony Fauci , DT director of NIAID , part of DT National Institutes of NNP , VBD DT data are a “ very important proof of concept ” and IN EX was reason for optimism . He cautioned DT data were not a “ knockout . ” At DT same NN , DT NN achieved its primary goal , which was to improve DT NN to recovery , which was reduced by four days for patients on remdesivir . DT preliminary data showed IN DT NN to recovery was 11 days on remdesivir compared to 15 days for placebo , a 31 % decrease . DT mortality rate for DT remdesivir group was 8 % , compared to 11.6 % for DT placebo group ; DT mortality difference was not statistically significant . DT is “ DT first convincing evidence IN an antiviral drug can really benefit NNP - CD patients , specifically hospitalized NNP - CD patients , ” VBD Frederick Hayden , a professor emeritus of clinical virology and medicine at DT University of Virginia School of Medicine . “ This will VB DT standard of care in DT NNP NNPS and other NNS for DT patients who have been shown to be benefited , ” he VBD , adding IN determining DT exact group WDT should receive DT drug will require further examination of DT data . Over DT past few weeks , EX have been conflicting reports about DT potential benefit of remdesivir , a drug WDT was previously tried in Ebola . As previously reported by STAT , an early peek at Gilead ’s NN in severe NNP - CD patients , based on data from a trial at a Chicago hospital , suggested patients were doing better than expected on remdesivir . Days later , a summary of results from a NN in NNP showed IN patients on DT drug did not improve more than those in a control group . Full results from DT NNP NN were RB released Wednesday . But DT NIAID NN , which was not expected to be released so soon , was by far DT most important and rigorously designed test of remdesivir in NNP - CD . DT NN compared remdesivir to placebo in 800 patients , with neither patients nor physicians knowing who got DT drug instead of a placebo , meaning IN unconscious biases will not affect DT conclusions . DT main goal of DT NN is DT NN until patients improve , with different measures of improvement depending on how sick PRP were to begin with . While DT result means IN DT drug helps patients improve faster , PRP is not possible to say how dramatic those improvements are . Scott Gottlieb , DT former commissioner of DT Food and Drug Administration , VBD he expected EX was enough evidence for DT agency to issue an “ emergency use authorization ” for remdesivir . “ Remdesivir is n’t a home run but looks active and can be part of a toolbox of drugs and diagnostics WDT substantially lower our risk heading into DT fall , ” he VBD . Aneesh Mehta , a physician at Emory University and an investigator in DT NIAID NN , VBD DT results were “ robust enough ” to report preliminary findings , but a full analysis of all DT data will be required to fully understand DT drug ’s effect . DT NN to recovery seen in DT final analysis “ MD be shorter , PRP MD be longer . PRP do n’t VB yet . ” Mehta RB expects DT final results to do some analyses on which patients might benefit most from remdesivir . DT FDA previously issued an emergency authorization for DT malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat NNP - CD , even though at least some studies suggested DT medicine was not effective . “ If hydroxychloroquine met [ DT emergency ] standard , then remdesivir MD have seemed to cross DT line a while ago , especially in DT setting of treating critically ill patients , ” Gottlieb VBD . Remdesivir , which must be given intravenously , is likely to remain a treatment for patients who are hospitalized . But PRP is RB likely IN PRP will be most effective in patients who have been infected more recently , VBD Nahid Bhadelia , JJ director of DT special pathogens unit at Boston NNP Center . “ PRP VBP IN with most antiviral medications DT earlier PRP give PRP DT better PRP is . ” VBD Bhadelia , who had experience giving remdesivir as an experimental treatment for Ebola in Africa , where results are less encouraging . DT means IN better diagnostic testing will be essential to identifying patients who MD benefit . “ What will be important is IN PRP find NNS on DT outpatient side , ” Bhadelia VBD . “ Again , testing becomes important , PRP VBP to have them come to DT hospital as soon as possible . ” Although DT data have not yet been released , PRP ’s standard procedure for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to release market - moving information as soon as PRP have PRP , due to regulatory requirements . Gilead on Wednesday did release data from its own NN of remdesivir in patients with severe NNP - CD . This NN showed similar rates of clinical improvement in patients treated with a five - day and 10 - day course of remdesivir , DT company VBD . “ Unlike traditional drug development , PRP are attempting to evaluate an investigational agent alongside an evolving JJ pandemic . Multiple concurrent studies are helping inform whether remdesivir is a safe and effective treatment for NN - CD and how to best utilize DT drug , ” VBD Merdad Parsey , Gilead ’s chief JJ officer , in a statement . Gilead VBD IN its own NN in severe patients showed IN PRP MD be possible to treat patients with a five - day treatment of remdesivir , not DT 10 - day course WDT was used in DT NIAID trial . DT company ’s NN is enrolling approximately 6,000 participants from 152 different clinical trial sites all over DT NN . DT data disclosed Wednesday are from 397 patients , with a statistical comparison of patient improvement between DT two remdesivir treatment arms — DT five - day and 10 - day treatment courses . Improvement was measured using a seven - point numerical scale WDT encompasses death ( at worst ) and discharge from hospital ( best outcome ) , with various degrees of supplemental oxygen and intubation in between . DT NN design means IN by itself PRP does n’t reveal much about how well remdesivir is working , because EX is no group of patients who were untreated . DT conclusion is IN DT two durations of treatment are basically DT same . Peter Bach , DT director of DT Center for NNP Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering NNP Center , VBD he is eager to see DT data from DT NIAID NN but renewed his criticism of Gilead ’s severe NN for lacking a control group of untreated patients . DT MD have allowed researchers to make important conclusions about how DT drug works WDT are just not possible now , he VBD . “ PRP ’ve squandered an unbelievable opportunity , ” Bach VBD . “ PRP ’s not VBG to tell PRP what to do with 80 - NN - olds with multiple comorbidities compared to 30 - NN - olds who are otherwise healthy . PRP ’re still VBG to be foundering around in DT dark , or at least in a dim room , when PRP MD have learned more . ” In DT NN , DT median NN to clinical improvement was 10 days in DT five - day treatment group and 11 days in DT 10 - day treatment group . More than half of DT patients in both groups were discharged from DT hospital by day 14 . At day 14 , 64.5 % of DT patients in DT five - day group and 53.8 % of DT patients in DT 10 - day group achieved clinical recovery . Patients in DT trial generally lived , though this MD be because their illness was not RB severe to begin with . For most of DT NN , patients already on ventilators were not enrolled . Eight percent of DT patients treated with five days of remdesivir died , compared to 11 % of DT patients treated for 10 days . Outside of Italy , where 77 patients were treated , DT overall mortality rate across DT entire NN was 7 % , Gilead VBD . Those mortality rates are lower than those seen in other studies , which have been in DT teens and twenties . Only 5 % of patients in DT five - day group and 10 % in DT 10 - day group had side effects WDT led to a discontinuation . DT most common bad effects — and PRP ’s impossible to tell which were from DT drug — were nausea and acute respiratory failure . High liver enzymes occurred in 7.3 % of patients , with 3 % of patients discontinuing DT drug due to elevated liver tests . A full evaluation of DT results will have to wait until complete data are available . In DT NNP NN , RB published Wednesday in DT Lancet , investigators found IN remdesivir “ did not significantly improve DT NN to clinical improvement , mortality , or NN to clearance of NN in patients with serious NN - CD compared with placebo . ” EX was a 23 % improvement in NN to clinical improvement for remdesivir compared to placebo , but DT difference was not statistically significant . At DT median , remdesivir - treated patients improved in 20 days compared to 23 days for placebo patients . At CD month , 14 % of DT remdesivir patients had died compared to 13 % of DT placebo - treated patients . DT NNP NN enrolled patients with more severe NN - CD than DT NN conducted by NIAID . DT NNP NN was RB stopped early because of difficulties enrolling patients as DT pandemic waned in NNP . Hayden , DT University of Virginia virologist , was CD of DT investigators in DT NNP NN and pointed to DT similarity of DT results . He VBD IN while DT NIAID investigators had been able to enroll enough patients , DT decrease in NNS in Wuhan due to DT lockdown had made DT impossible . “ I was struck by DT consistency , ” he VBD ."

Unfortunately , a million dollars is not enough to buy luxury in London , Manhattan , Tokyo , Paris , San Francisco , or Sydney . But PRP does buy luxury in much of DT rest of DT NN . In fact , PRP do n't need nearly RB much . EX are plenty of destinations around DT NN where PRP can live IN a millionaire for just a few thousand dollars a month . Forget about DT billionaires with all those things WDT PRP never use . Start researching where DT cost of living is low enough to live in relative splendor for far less than a million dollars . This tiny Central American nation , home to DT famous Panama Canal , has regularly garnered a top spot on DT International Living Annual NNP Retirement Index . Whether PRP relocate to DT Caribbean or Pacific coast , no matter if PRP prefer a tropical or temperate NN , DT affordable quality of life remains a consistent draw . Panama City is DT most sophisticated and expensive part of DT country . However , PRP is still possible to live in NN - class luxury for under $ 4,000 a month . Even $ 1,500 buys considerable comfort in Panama City . Mountain towns , such as Boquete , offer milder temperatures and a lower cost of living . If PRP find IN PRP VBP living here , PRP is surprisingly cheap and easy to retire to Panama . A good starting point to budget a Thai lifestyle is 65,000 Thai bahts or around $ 2,000 per month . DT 's what DT Thai NN demands of expatriates who seek a retirement visa . Even $ 3,500 wo n’t buy all - out luxury in Bangkok , where upmarket condos might require a budget closer to $ 5,000 per month . However , $ 2,000 will allow for a very comfortable lifestyle in smaller cities . Look into lovely Chiang Mai , renowned for its historic temples , cuisine , and forested hills . Considering IN most locals VBP by on less than $ 1,000 a month , $ 3,000 MD feel IN a princely sum . EX are RB JJ other fascinating places to retire in Thailand . Spain deserves a spot on this list for CD simple reason . PRP ’s DT only low - priced country WDT ranks in Numbeo 's top ten for quality of life . Of course , PRP ’ll need to steer clear of Madrid and Barcelona if PRP ’re seeking a posh lifestyle for poquito dinero ( not much money ) . Fortunately , JJ smaller cities and towns offer plenty of cultural , culinary , and recreational delights for a relatively modest price tag . Granada offers a relaxed and affordable lifestyle . PRP is home to DT Alhambra , a NNP Heritage Site WDT was a finalist in DT contest to be CD of DT modern seven wonders of DT NN . A city center three - bedroom apartment rents for about $ 690 , while a three - course meal for two at a midrange restaurant comes to only around $ 23 . These prices are practically unheard of in DT other NNS WDT rank in DT top ten for quality of life . Seville is similarly low - priced and holds such wonders as DT Alcazar Palace ( Dorn on Game of Thrones ) and DT fabulous Roman ruins in Italica . PRP is even possible to retire in Spain with $ 200,000 . Do n’t discount Mexico as merely a vacation spot . This fascinating country is much more than DT Yucatan Peninsula , DT string of gorgeous beaches with all DT tourist trappings WDT gorgeous beaches bring . In fact , Mexico has been gaining popularity as a retirement spot due to reasons WDT transcend its miles of oceanfront . PRP can live in Mexico in relative luxury ( VB maid service , a gardener , and dinners out ) on a budget of less than $ 2,500 a month . Certain provinces of Mexico continue to be dangerous , but others are considered much safer . At 122 square miles , Malta is a tiny bit of island paradise in DT Mediterranean . Beautiful apartments in DT capital city of Valletta rent for under $ 1,500 per month , so a $ 3,000 monthly budget stretches far here . Malta has JJ charms WDT are difficult to match in Europe . While famous capitals , such as Berlin and Paris , are freezing in DT winter , temperatures in Malta hover in DT balmy 60s . If foreign languages are n’t your forte , PRP ’re RB in luck : English is an official language in Malta . DT Philippines has CD of DT lowest costs of living in DT NN , a warm NN , and JJ attractive destinations for expatriates . Here , PRP is possible to rent a large house with a private pool , a maid , and a chauffeur for what PRP MD cost to rent a luxury apartment in some NNS . Strong historical ties with DT NNP NNPS RB helped make DT Philippines friendly to English speakers . EX are several well - developed parts of DT country , such as Cebu City , WDT cater to retirees and other expatriates . However , PRP is essential to consider DT pros and cons of retiring in DT Philippines . Most NNS VBP of overpriced Paris when PRP VBP of France , but those who VBP DT country best have always known better . Louis XIV knew how to live , and he preferred living in Versailles . PRP is possible to live IN an aristocrat , if not a king , for under $ 5,000 per month just outside Paris near Versailles . Parts of DT Loire Valley , home to so JJ beautiful chateaus , are RB surprisingly affordable . France features a fabulous quality of life . DT fantastic food , rich history , refined culture , beautiful landscapes , and livable cities have drawn travelers for centuries . PRP can live very well in JJ parts of France for less than $ 3,000 a month . Just avoid Paris . EX is so much to love about living in Portugal . DT friendly NNS , romantic architecture , sunny beaches , port wine , and haunting fado music make for a unique experience . In Lisbon , Portugal ’s most expensive city , a furnished two - bedroom flat in an upscale area can be found for around $ 1,000 a month . EX are JJ alluring cities in Portugal for retirees . PRP should not be too hard to save enough money to retire in Portugal . Adventure junkies hold Costa Rica — Spanish for “ rich coast ” — dear to their hearts . DT ’s because this compact country is bursting at DT seams with waterfalls , rivers , lakes , and miles of pristine beaches . RB , do n't forget DT dramatic volcanoes and diverse wildlife . Why not extend a Costa Rican adventure into a NN - round lifestyle ? Living in Costa Rica is even more affordable than vacationing RB . In resort towns along DT central coast , a typical two - bedroom condo near DT beach can be rented for less than $ 1,000 per month . PRP might even VB to buy a beach condo in Costa Rica . Another draw ? JJ care is RB excellent and inexpensive . With bragging rights for DT cheapest cost of living in Central America , Nicaragua gets its fair share of budget and adventure travelers . PRP are drawn to warm weather , vibrant cities , colonial architecture , and idyllic seaside villages . Sure , Nicaragua 's history of civil war and revolutionary upheaval scares away some travelers . DT RB means fewer NNS have discovered how nice Nicaragua can be today , so prices remain low . Granada is perched upon DT picturesque north shore of Lake Nicaragua , with a volcano in view to add to DT postcard - perfect scene . This city is home to JJ North American retirees in search of DT good life . Monthly expenses for a comfortable lifestyle average around $ 1,000 . Just imagine what PRP MD do with three times DT . Nicaragua is CD of DT best NNS for retirement in Latin America . If PRP VBP to VB more from your portfolio in a beautiful location , consider relocating to CD of these ten destinations . Here , paradise — or at least a very high quality of life — comes with a decidedly lower price tag ."

Connor , son of famous flat - earther Dave Murphy , spoke exclusively to UNILAD about NASA , DT Sun , Photoshop and pretty much everything PRP ’ve ever wanted to ask someone who thinks DT reason PRP see DT curvature of NNP from a plane is because DT windows are round . Speaking about why NASA and DT NN MD lie about space travel , he VBD : EX are two good reasons in my opinion . CD obvious reason MD be money . DT money raised by NASA alone since their inception is something IN fifteen trillion dollars , and with DT money PRP ’ve really shown little for their work . PRP ’re releasing composite images and articles and telling PRP this is what ’s happening , this is what PRP ’re doing , and PRP spent seven hundred million dollars to VB this photo of Pluto WDT PRP had to put together in Photoshop . A second thing is to make NNS feel insignificant . PRP makes PRP feel IN PRP ’re an insignificant speck of dust and therefore PRP ’re easy to control . Basically if PRP can imagine DT globe squashed down with Antarctica instead of being its own continent , being DT perimeter around DT side . So a lot of NNS say DT ’s an NN wall . PRP ’s more IN a shelf or cliff . EX ’s NN above , EX ’s DT firmament – or DT dome – and EX ’s NN above PRP and NN below PRP and EX ’s no leaving PRP , EX ’s no finding other Suns and stuff . PRP ca n’t fall off DT edge , essentially . What about DT curve of DT NNP PRP can see when PRP fly ? Conor VBD : PRP can not see curvature from a plane . DT reason why PRP MD seem is because of DT way planes have to be designed . Every single window on a plane has to be round and curved because DT cabin itself is curved . PRP ca n’t have straight panes or PRP MD explode and everyone with DT plane MD be done . Next NN PRP ’re on a plane , look out DT window and at DT wing , because DT wing will seem to curve as well . Connor believes DT only reason a lot of find Flat NNP conspiracies a complete joke is because PRP ’re taught to do so from a very early age . He did n’t personally always believe DT NNP was flat , but as he got older and delved into PRP he found EX to be too JJ ‘ inconsistencies with DT model PRP ’re taught at school ’ , he MD n’t ignore them anymore . ‘ At CD point , ’ he finishes , ‘ PRP have to make a decision on where PRP lie on PRP and I had to pick DT Flat NNP . ’"

Bread , in all its various forms , is DT most widely consumed food in DT NN . Not only is PRP an important source of carbohydrates , PRP ’s RB portable and compact , which helps to explain why PRP has been an integral part of our diet for thousands of NNS . In fact , recent scholarship suggests humans started baking bread at least 30,000 NNS ago . Prehistoric man had already been making gruel from NN and grains , so PRP was a small jump to starting cooking this mixture into a solid by frying PRP on stones . A 2010 NN by DT National Academy of Sciences discovered traces of starch ( likely from DT roots of cattails and ferns ) in prehistoric mortar and pestle - IN rocks . DT roots MD have been peeled and dried before PRP were ground into flour and mixed with NN . Finally , DT paste MD be cooked on heated rocks . But how did humanity VB from this prehistoric flatbread to a fluffy , grocery store loaf ? EX were three primary innovations WDT created “ modern ” bread . 1. Leavening Leavening is what makes bread rise into a light and fluffy loaf . Bread without leavening is a known as flatbread , and is DT most closely related to mankind ’s first breads . Examples include Middle Eastern pita , Indian naan and Central American tortillas . DT most common leavening for bread is yeast . Yeast floats around in DT air , looking for a nice place to make a home — IN a starchy bowl of flour and NN . DT first leavened bread was likely DT result of some passing yeast making a home in a bowl of gruel . DT yeast began eating DT sugars present in grain , and excreting CO2 , producing bubbles WDT resulted in lighter , airier bread . Commercial yeast production dates back to DT skilled bread makers of Ancient Egypt around 300 B.C . 2. Refined Flour DT earliest bread grains MD have been ground by hand with rocks . This MD have resulted in coarse , whole grain bread — DT descendants of which are dark , rustic breads from Europe , IN pumpernickel . DT Mesopotamians refined this process around 800 B.C. , using two flat , circular stones , stacked on top CD another to grind DT grain . These stones were continuously rotated by draft animals or slaves . This “ milling ” — which was DT genesis for how PRP create flour today–created smooth , finely ground flour WDT quickly became prized as a status symbol . DT desire for DT whitest , most refined bread continued through DT modern era , and later advancements included DT sifting of flour to remove DT bran and DT germ and DT bleaching of DT flour itself . 3. Mechanized Slicing . For hundreds of NNS , DT finest white breads were sold in whole loaves to be cut at home — IN a French baguette . DT NNP York NNP Library ’s “ Lunch ” exhibit notes : “ Nineteenth and early 20th - century cookbooks and magazines gave highly specific advice about lunchtime sandwich making . For ladies and NNS , DT bread was supposed to be sliced very thinly and DT crusts removed . For workers , thick slices with crusts were deemed more appropriate . ” But in 1917 , itinerant jeweler Otto Rohwedder created DT first mechanized bread slicer . Initially , JJ companies were convinced IN housewives MD n’t be interested , and his bread - slicing machine was n’t installed in a factory until 1928 . However , within two NNS , 90 % of store - bought bread was factory sliced . Progress led PRP to what was supposed to be DT ideal loaf of bread : white , ultra - fluffy and pre-cut into even slices . This perfect bread was dubbed “ American . ” By this standard , Wonderbread should have been DT last loaf of bread PRP ever needed . But modern NN has uncovered DT nutritional benefit of whole grains , and more and more consumers prefer DT toothsome texture and nutty taste of a rustic loaf . If PRP feel inspired to replicate a prehistoric recipe IN I was , I ’ll warn PRP IN Bob ’s Red Mill does not make a “ Cattail / Fern Blend Flour ” — yet . Settle for a “ 10 Grain Breakfast Cereal ” full of ancient grains , IN millet , coarsely ground . Then , visit your local home improvement store , and poke around DT slate tiling . PRP MD be able to nab a few pieces of broken tile for free . Or , if PRP live somewhere PRP are easily accessible , simply walk outside and pick up a flat rock . Now , PRP need to build a big fire . ( DT ’s what I did at DT Old Stone House of Brooklyn , a historic site WDT ’s surrounded by NNS ’s park . ) Let DT flames die down until PRP have a bed of glowing , hot coals . Set DT slate tiles on top of DT coals , and wait about 10 minutes . Combine three cups of grain with about a cup of NN and mix into a thick , workable paste . Form DT dough into CD - inch thick patties , and place them on DT stones . After five minutes , flip them with a piece of bark — and PRP ’ll be amazed to see DT grain is browning on DT heated rock . PRP MD stick , so I recommend greasing your cooking rocks before hand . In about 10 minutes , PRP ’ll have a pile of hot , crispy cakes . DT outside is crunchy and tastes IN popcorn , DT inside is moist and dense . I fed CD to CD of DT NNS in DT park , who described PRP as “ pretty good , ” though PRP ’s possible she was just being nice ."

By bypassing NN and ethical issues associated transhumanism , this body hacking pushes this movement to strange JJ frontiers . As stated in my previous articles about DT subject , transhumanism has been heavily promoted in mass NN in DT past NNS , whether PRP be through movies , music videos , video games and documentaries . Often , DT word “ transhumanism ” is n’t even used . Instead , PRP simply show how a robotic enhancement “ upgrades ” DT human body and makes PRP cooler , effectively selling DT idea to NNS who believe PRP are being entertained – especially young NNS . A by - product of this trend is “ body hacking ” , a movement WDT forgoes DT ethical and philosophical questions associated with transhumanism to VB right into drilling robotic parts onto PRP ’s body . While JJ of PRP dread DT day when microchips implants will be a requirement in a dystopian society , some NNS actually pay to have PRP done to them . Here ’s an interesting article about DT movement from NPR . A curious crowd lingered around Amal Graafstra as he carefully unpacked a pair of gloves , a small sterile blanket and a huge needle . A long line of NNS were waiting to VB tiny computer chips implanted into their hands . Graafstra had set up shop in a booth in DT middle of an exhibit hall at DT Austin Convention Center in Texas ’ capital , where he gathered last month with several hundred others who call themselves “ body hackers ” — NNS who push DT boundaries of implantable technology to improve DT human body . DT movement evokes visceral reactions , brings up safety and ethical concerns and quickly veers into sci- fi questions about DT line between human and cyborg . Graafstra is a pioneer in DT space . Using his own body to experiment , he designed bio -safe magnets and DT microchip he was about to implant into DT hand of A.J. Butt , who was sporting a tall , blue mohawk . DT implantable RFID chips hold encrypted information , and their unique ID numbers can be used to open doors or unlock DT owner ’s smartphone , which is what Butt wanted to do . Butt took a deep breath . DT needle plunged into his skin at DT base of his thumb , and a chip bigger than a grain of rice slipped just below DT surface . Across DT way , Sasha Rose , who was working a meditation booth at DT convention , watched DT NNS line up to be “ chipped . ” She shook her head : This was DT craziest thing she had seen . She wondered about Graafstra ’s credentials . She thought this was a JJ procedure , so should he be performing PRP ? Did his clients VB DT potential consequences of carrying personal information on a device inside their skin ? “ More than DT crazy concept , PRP ’s actually NNS ’s willingness to accept PRP . DT ’s why PRP ’s crazy to me , ” Rose VBD . “ NNS are just willing to just line up and VB , ‘ Yeah , stick DT in me . ’ ” At night , JJ of DT convention - goers gathered at a club on Austin ’s Sixth Street . Graafstra was outside with Ryan O’Shea , whose company Grindhouse Wetware made DT Internet squirm earlier this NN when PRP released a close - up surgery video of CD of its implants called Northstar . In PRP , a man gets a small incision in his hand , and then , with a metallic tool dipped into PRP , DT skin is lifted to produce a cavity where a round subdermal implant with five LED lights is placed . DT result looks dystopian — DT incision is stitched with black thread , and LED lights make DT skin on DT hand glow red . But body hackers view DT NN differently , Graafstra VBD . PRP believe technology has reached a point where PRP can improve DT human body instead of just fixing what ’s broken . “ A patient MD someday come very soon and say , ‘ My eye is totally fine , but I VBP an eye WDT can see infrared . And I VBP an eye WDT can zoom , ’ ” Graafstra VBD . DT kind of future — where DT human body is augmented by technology — is DT goal of JJ of these experiments . O’Shea VBD Grindhouse Wetware is using its LED device to test how long a device IN PRP can remain charged inside a body , and Graafstra VBD his RFID chip is a small attempt at merging digital identity with physical identity . “ I VBP once NNS realize , ‘ Oh , PRP ’s OK IN my grandma has a pacemaker ’ … NNS are VBG to start to accept this , ” O ’Shea VBD . “ PRP VBP , DT era of transhumanism , I MD say , is here . So let ’s accept DT and then see where DT logically takes PRP . ” Inside DT club , a drone hovered above DT dance floor . DT polished steel and DT electronic dance music gave PRP a futuristic feel . Standing near DT bar was Tony Salvador , who studies social values and how PRP affect technology at Intel . He was at DT conference to VB a feel of when and if “ body hacking ” MD be accepted into DT mainstream . Sometimes , he VBD , technology moves too fast and outpaces accepted social boundaries — not to mention laws . He argued DT was part of DT reason why early wearers of Google Glass were called “ glassholes . ” “ PRP created a social misunderstanding , ” Salvador VBD . “ PRP did n’t VB what was VBG on . ” To Salvador , DT boundaries of acceptance are a matter of our social philosophy , an area WDT he argued was driven by esoteric discourse without tangible moral and ethical recommendations . DT philosophers , he VBD , are letting PRP down . Alva Noë , a philosopher at DT University of California , Berkeley and a contributor to NPR ’s 13.7 : Cosmos and Culture blog , has written extensively on what he calls “ cyborgian naturalness . ” He disagreed IN DT modern philosophers dropped DT ball , saying IN tackling DT matter MD involve unpacking two questions : • Is PRP OK to cut into human bodies for these kinds of experiments ? • How much tolerance should society have for artificially enhancing DT body ? To DT first question , Noë VBD he found DT “ body hacking ” experimentation on humans “ ethically disturbing ” and MD n’t fathom a doctor or any other NNS conducting these kinds of operations . DT second question was more complicated . “ PRP do n’t condemn NNS for using glasses to see better , ” he VBD . “ But PRP do start to VB taking speed to cope with your work life is questionable . ” Because those kinds of judgments are an ethical question , drawing a tolerance line MD always be a moving target , he VBD . “ PRP MD reach consensuses and then lose them , ” Noë VBD . “ Just as EX was once a consensus where PRP was OK to smoke to function effectively , and now PRP have DT consensus IN , increasingly , PRP ’s not OK to do DT . ” If EX ’s a rock star in DT body - hacking movement , PRP ’s Neil Harbisson , a colorblind artist from Barcelona who persuaded a doctor to implant a camera in DT back of his head . DT antenna , as he calls PRP , essentially lets Harbisson listen to colors by detecting DT dominant color in front of him and translating PRP into musical notes . DT way he tells PRP , a JJ ethics committee in Europe had refused to sign off on DT operation , but a doctor agreed to perform DT surgery anonymously . From PRP , Harbisson emerged with a camera connected to a device on DT back of his skull , its lens dangling in front of his face on a rod WDT arcs over his head . As he walked DT streets of Austin , he described how he perceived DT NN : DT red traffic light sounded IN an A note ; DT green grass sounded IN an F . In his keynote address at DT conference , Harbisson VBD DT first NN he heard those colors in his sleep , he felt truly cyborg . Now , he no longer identifies as human but as a “ cybernetic organism . ” “ If PRP define ourselves as organisms , suddenly our group is wider , ” he VBD . “ PRP are on DT same level as an insect , or as a cat , or as a plant . ” Harbisson is well aware of how DT NN perceives him . He moved from Barcelona to NNP York City in search of “ peace ” with another friend in DT transhumanist movement , Moon Ribas . Ribas has an electronic device in her arm WDT she VBD vibrates when EX is an earthquake anywhere in DT NN . On more than CD occasion , NNS have tried to rip off his antenna , Harbisson VBD . DT ’s part of DT reason why he co-founded DT Cyborg Foundation to advocate for “ cyborg rights . ” When asked if he ’s ever thought about just taking DT antenna off , Harbisson demurred . “ To me , PRP ’s much stronger , DT wish to sense what ’s around me , than DT fact IN NNS keep annoying me , ” he VBD , adding IN maybe , in DT future , as others VBP JJ senses , he ’ll be considered normal ."

"" Thompson did n’t include any disagreement . While DT networks had plenty of NN to worry about DT future of birds , most network NN shows did n’t take much NN to include any other point of view even though hundreds of NNS have expressed skepticism of manmade NN NN theory . Another NBC reporter , Kerry Sanders , hyped DT threat of NN to polar bears and walruses on Dec. 9 , 2007 , "" a NN NNS say MD melt away by 2050 . "" Sanders did n’t include any NNS who disagreed with DT claim . DT lack of balance on DT issue prompted CD network journalist , John Stossel of ABC , to do a story on DT NN ’s CD - sidedness on “ 20/20 ” Oct. CD , 2007 . “ PRP ’ve heard DT reports . DT globe is VBG . And PRP ’s our fault . And DT consequences will be terrible . But PRP should VB EX is another side to this story , ” teased Stossel as he began his “ Give me a Break ” segment . EX is another side to DT issue . In CD story , Stossel interviewed four NNS critical of DT so - called “ consensus ” on JJ NN . DT ’s four more dissenting NNS than CBS put on its network in six entire months . To better assess network behavior on this key topic , DT Business & NNP Institute examined 205 stories from ABC , CBS and NBC WDT mentioned "" JJ NN "" or "" NN NN "" between July 1 , 2007 , and Dec. 31 , 2007 . BMI found skepticism was shut out of a vast majority of reports . Overall , a measly 20 percent had any dissent at all referenced by a journalist or guest . Skeptical voices were suppressed by DT networks , outnumbered by nearly a 7 - to - 1 ratio by those promoting fear of NN NN or being used by DT network for DT same purpose . CBS had an even worse record : nearly 38 proponents to CD skeptic . Lengthy segments IN Scott Pelley ’s Oct. 21 , 2007 , "" 60 Minutes "" story on "" DT Age of Megafires "" certainly had NN to include an alternative point of view to DT notion IN JJ NN is largely responsible for bigger , hotter fires in DT American West . But Pelley skipped those voices – voices IN a University of California Merced professor published on DT Washington Spokesman - Review Web site about DT California wildfires . According to Alan Zarembo’s Oct. 24 , 2007 , story , “ NNS VBD PRP MD be difficult to make DT case , given DT combustible mix of drought and wind WDT has plagued DT region for centuries or more . ” Anthony Westerling , a UC - Merced professor and NN scientist , told Zarembo IN DT wildfires were DT result of two “ staples of DT region ’s climatic history , ” meaning “ strong Santa Ana winds ” and “ a drought WDT turned much of DT hillsides to bone - dry kindling . ” "" Neither can be attributed to NN NN , "" VBD Westerling . DT near blackout of skepticism on DT networks did n’t come as much of a surprise , since reporters IN Pelley have been much more than onlookers in DT story of JJ NN . In JJ NNS PRP have become advocates – even VBG “ to DT ends of DT NN ” “ to find evidence of NN NN . ” Ann Curry of NBC’s “ Today ” made DT clear on Oct. 29 , 2007 : “ [ O ] ur mission , of course , is to find evidence of NN NN . ” When NNS with other views were mentioned , PRP sometimes came with a denigrating label IN “ deniers ” or “ cynics . ” Such critics were RB portrayed as flat - earthers by journalists and guests . CD person skeptical of manmade NN NN , a Kentucky NN representative , managed to VB on DT air but was treated to an exceptionally hostile interview by ABC ’s Bill Weir . EX were JJ other flaws in DT reporting WDT created a very CD - sided perspective . Journalists repeatedly phrased questions or made statements indicating human - caused NN was a fact , and PRP included opinions of politicians , movie stars , musicians and ordinary NNS IN bankers instead of relying on NNS . But according to Dr. Pat Michaels viewers MD be better served by hearing both sides . “ PRP MD benefit from appreciating DT true scientific diversity on DT topic . DT arguments against these gloom and doom JJ NN scenarios are much stronger than DT arguments for them , ” Michaels told BMI . According to NBC ’s Brian Williams , “ EX ’s no shortage of folks out RB saying PRP ’s [ JJ NN is ] not all RB bad . ” Williams was teasing a “ Nightly NNP ” story on August 15 WDT included two other voices : Dr. Pat Michaels , a research professor of environmental sciences , and Marlo Lewis , senior fellow at DT Competitive Enterprise Institute . Williams was certainly right – EX are hundreds of NNS from around DT NN who question DT JJ NN “ consensus ” – but in DT NN DT latter half of 2007 PRP had to look hard to find them . On DT three networks , 80 percent of stories ( 167 out of 205 ) did n’t mention skepticism or anyone at all who dissented from JJ NN alarmism . CBS did DT absolute worst job . Ninety - seven percent of its stories ( 34 out of 35 ) ignored other opinions . Williams ’ own network , NBC , came in a close second with 85 percent ( 76 out of 89 ) excluding skepticism . ABC was DT most balanced network , but still censored dissent from 64 percent of its stories ( 34 out of 53 ) . But dissent flourishes . DT U.S. Senate Environment and NNP Works ( EPW ) Committee released a list on Dec. 20 , 2007 , of more than 400 skeptical NNS from different fields – astrophysics , geology , climatology , meteorology and others . DT release did n’t even earn a NN brief from CD of DT three networks as of Dec. 31 , 2007 . Even when CD show claimed PRP MD represent a range of opinions on DT issue , PRP did n’t . On Oct. 30 , 2007 , NBC “ Today ” co-host Matt Lauer teased DT upcoming “ Ends of DT NNP ” broadcasts saying to Meredith Vieira , “ And PRP ’re VBG to be interviewing all DT experts talking about DT issues of NN NN . ” ( emphasis added ) Vieira replied , “ Absolutely . Getting into a whole debate , too , because some NNS believe EX ’s an effect of NN NN , others say not really . So PRP ’re VBG to discuss all of PRP and give viewers at home real tips on what PRP can do . ” But on Nov. 5 and 6 , 2007 as “ Today ” went to DT “ Ends of DT NNP , ” DT only “ experts ” Vieira spoke to were former vice NN Al Gore , Chip Giller of Grist.org – a left - wing environmental Web site – and Katherine Wroth , co-author of “ Wake Up and Smell DT NNP . ” Grist is an extreme publication . David Roberts of DT environmentalist magazine called for "" war crimes trials for these bastards ¬– some sort of NN Nuremberg , "" referring to DT NN NN "" denial industry . "" ( Roberts later retracted his comment , but not until PRP received a strongly negative response . ) DT only skepticism of JJ NN “ consensus ” WDT came up was a brief mention by Vieira as she interviewed Gore . She asked Gore about John Christy , CD scientist formerly with DT NNP Nations ’ Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) , who criticized Gore ’s predictions in an op - ed printed in DT Wall Street Journal . Gore shot back calling Christy an “ outlier . ” Vieira did n’t question Gore ’s remark or give Christy an opportunity to respond to DT attack . Perhaps if she had , Christy MD have echoed his remarks from DT Nov. 1 , 2007 , Wall Street Journal : “ I see neither DT developing catastrophe nor DT smoking gun proving IN human activity is to blame for most of DT NN PRP see . Rather , I see a reliance on NN models ( useful but never ‘ proof ’ ) and DT coincidence IN NN in carbon dioxide and JJ temperatures have loose similarity over NN , ” VBD Christy . He continued , “ PRP [ dissenting NNS ] discount DT possibility IN everything is caused by human actions , because everything PRP ’ve seen DT NN do has happened before . NN levels rise and fall continually . DT Arctic NN cap has shrunk before . CD millennium EX are hippos swimming in DT Thames , and a geological blink later EX is an NN bridge linking Asia and North America . ” Journalists practically drooled over Al Gore during Live NNP interviews and after he won DT Nobel Peace Prize . In contrast , NNS with alternative views barely got face NN on DT networks . Instead , PRP received insults and hostile questions . DT ugliest treatment of a skeptic was by Bill Weir on Nov. 18 , 2007 , “ Good Morning America . ” He was interviewing Democratic NN representative Bill Gooch from Kentucky . Weir peppered Gooch with hardball questions and even attacked Gooch ’s motives : Gooch made PRP clear IN he supported an open debate , saying , “ [ T ] here is another side of DT story . I VBP what PRP have is PRP have DT problem of JJ NN about to become a political problem when lawmakers in Congress , when governors in NNS , when even DT courts start to act in ways WDT are gonna affect DT American NNS in severe ways . ” Gooch then mentioned DT possible $ 6 - trillion cost of CD bill to deal with JJ NN . “ And what I wanna make sure IN PRP do is IN if PRP act , PRP have DT NN right , ” explained Gooch . Weir was n’t satisfied : “ But , but according to all these NNS , DT more handwringing PRP do , DT more PRP dither on this , DT worse PRP ’s VBG to VB . And what if PRP ’re wrong ? What if this is , in fact , a JJ catastrophe ? Is n’t PRP a moral imperative as a JJ servant to err on DT side of planetary survival and VB something done ? ” Instead of letting Gooch debate with someone who disagreed , Weir filled DT role himself . He came across as a passionate advocate for “ something ” WDT MD supposedly aid “ survival , ” ignoring DT cost , accuracy , and his supposed objectivity . Journalists RB called skeptics “ deniers , ” conjuring images of Holocaust deniers , and cast them as flat - earthers – ironically forgetting IN EX was once a scientific consensus IN DT NN was flat . When Gore attacked Dr. Christy [ who was mentioned by Meredith Vieira ] on “ Today ” Nov. 5 , 2007 , Gore specifically compared NNS critical of anthropogenic ( human - caused ) JJ NN to NNS who VBP DT NNP is flat . “ Well , he ’s an outlier , he no longer belongs to DT IPCC . And he is way outside DT scientific consensus … EX are still NNS who believe IN DT NNP is flat , ” VBD Gore . Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger made DT same disparaging comparison on July 16 , 2007 “ Early Show ” on CBS . After co-host Harry Smith VBD , “ [ I ] asked why some NNS still do n’t believe PRP have a problem . ” “ Well , I VBP IN EX is [ sic ] still a lot of NNS WDT still VBP IN DT NN is flat , ” VBD Schwarzenegger . NBC ’s chief environmental affairs correspondent Anne Thompson VBD , "" He is proudly a denier , "" of research professor and CATO senior fellow Dr. Pat Michaels . Michaels told BMI , “ She has no idea what she ’s talking about . I have written and spoken repeatedly in DT last 15 NNS IN human beings are responsible for most of DT NN in DT past century . ” What Michaels disagrees on is whether such NN will result in environmental catastrophe . Recalling DT NBC interview , Michaels continued , “ DT interview was great , but she pulled out CD little piece and took PRP completely out of context . PRP was really , really disappointing . DT interview was conducted in a very professional fashion , PRP was DT editing WDT clearly did not reflect DT tone and content of DT overall interview . ” Thompson actually included two dissenting views in DT Aug. 15 , 2007 , “ Nightly NN ” but undermined both their opinions by implying PRP were not experts and were only making trouble : “ NN experts say whether hired guns or honest dissenters , deniers are confusing DT issue and delaying solutions . ” A paltry 37 NNS expressing skepticism were included in six months of TV NN coverage on DT issue across three networks . DT included all kinds of NNS IN politicians or NN employees , business representatives , celebrities , ordinary NNS and unidentified NNS . Only seven of them were NNS IN Michaels . CBS practically banned skeptics from its network , including only four and not a single scientist . DT network seemed to adopt DT mentality of CBS journalist Scott Pelley , who referred to JJ NN skeptics as “ deniers ” in March 2006 when he VBD , “ If I do an interview with [ Holocaust survivor ] Elie Wiesel , am I required as a journalist to find a Holocaust denier ? ” Recent “ 60 Minutes ” segments from Pelley indicated he has n’t changed his mind about balanced journalism . Those skeptical of DT environmental impact of Gore ’s Live NNP concerts on July 7 , 2007 RB earned scorn from DT NN – even those IN Bob Geldof who were n’t questioning DT NN . “ [ T ] here have been cynics out RB who question whether DT artists are practicing what PRP preach , ” VBD NBC ’s Lester Holt on July 7 , 2007 “ Today . ” ABC ’s Bill Weir claimed IN “ all DT NNS ” urge immediate action to stop JJ NN , but PRP was n’t just NNS DT three networks relied on to make DT case . Far from PRP . EX were politicians and NN workers . Musicians IN Madonna and Dave Matthews . Movie star Leonardo DiCaprio . And quite possibly , your next - door neighbor . What those celebrities VBD had little to do with NN and everything to do with advocacy . Singer KT Tunstall , a Live NNP performer , was quoted by ABC on July 7 , 2007 . “ I VBP I am an environmentalist . I mean , I do n’t have a car . I live in a small apartment , ” VBD Tunstall . Madonna urged Live NNP attendees , "" If PRP wanna save DT NN , let me see PRP jumping up and down . "" But PRP was n’t just globe - trotting stars telling NNS DT NN was in danger and crowding out any other perspective . Politicians offered perhaps more substance , but certainly not much more NN than DT Hollywood types . In addition to fawning over Gore , networks interviewed Florida Gov. Charlie Crist ( R ) , California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ( R ) and NNP York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg ( Independent ) , among others . Reporters RB relied on ordinary voices to reinforce DT idea IN JJ NN was already a major threat impacting our daily lives . Only 15 percent of DT NNS used to support JJ NN positions were NNS – identified as a "" scientist "" or with a specialty IN genetics , ecology , biology or oceanography . A total of 71 NNS were included in six months of coverage . But networks turned to ordinary , unidentified NNS nearly a third more often than DT NNS ( 101 to 71 . ) Networks turned to ordinary NNS IN two Live NNP concertgoers and DT unidentified female “ consumer ” quoted by ABC “ NNP NNP with Charles Gibson ” on Sept. 14 , 2007 . “ PRP VBP , I VBP everybody ’s got to VB about PRP . PRP ’ve got to VB , ” VBD a woman in a story about carbon labeling of food products . Those quotes were used to underline DT points WDT reporters made . CD story on “ Today ” Nov. 6 , 2007 , warned IN melting NN MD kill off polar bears . Reporter Kerry Sanders included three unidentified NNS talking about polar bears – supporting his remark IN “ Worst - case scenario : If DT Arctic NN continues to melt , in DT next 100 NNS , DT U.S. Wildlife Service says DT only place PRP ’ll find a polar bear will be at DT zoo . ” Worries over Arctic melt flooded JJ NN coverage in DT latter half of 2007 , but as columnist John Tierney wrote in DT Jan. 1 , 2008 NNP York Times : “ When DT Arctic NN NN last NN [ 2007 ] hit DT lowest level ever recorded by satellites , PRP was big NN and heralded as a sign IN DT whole NN was VBG . When DT Antarctic NN NN last NN reached DT highest level ever recorded by satellites , PRP was pretty much ignored . ” No Need for Debate , NN is ‘ Fact ’ To JJ in DT NN NN , JJ NN and its reported cause were already established fact . PRP was clear by DT way some journalists talked about NN IN PRP had accepted Gore ’s insistence IN “ DT debate ’s over . ” Just listen to CBS ’s Harry Smith : “ Before PRP do anything else , EX is , in fact , JJ NN NN . PRP really affects some climates much more than others and PRP ’s really caused some real serious problems . ” Those serious problems Smith was talking about were allergies during a segment on DT Aug. 7 , 2007 “ Early Show . ” ABC ’s Sam Champion seemed to agree . Champion called DT fourth U.N. IPCC report “ definitive ” on Sept. 5 , 2007 and VBD he had been “ investigating DT alarming numbers of animals WDT are disappearing due to JJ NN ” in July . But Dan Harris went DT farthest on Dec. 2 , 2007 in a story about security risk and JJ NN . DT “ NNP NNP Sunday ” host told viewers to “ VB about this scenario : JJ NN contributes to a severe drought and food shortage in a third - NN country . DT NN collapses . Warlords take over . America is forced to intervene . ” Shockingly , Harris then claimed : “ PRP ’s already happened , Somalia , 1993 , with disastrous consequences . ” Harris excluded expertise on DT Somali situation or any context . Human Rights Watch , a liberal international organization , gave a very different perspective at DT NN of DT crisis back in 1992 : “ Somalia has historically been subject to famines , especially in DT pastoral areas of DT center and north … DT current famine WDT threatens Mogadishu and south - central Somalia is radically different in origin and impact . Drought has played only a minor role , and DT main victims are poor townspeople , farmers and rural laborers . ” DT ABC correspondent did n’t include any statements about DT way DT war was thought to have contributed to DT famine . Journalists were n’t DT only ones claiming IN JJ NN was a fact , though . But DT NNS journalists chose to interview RB included Gore saying DT “ debate ’s over ” and did n’t dispute Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. ’s incorrect statement IN EX was “ zero dissent ” on DT issue , or Leonardo DiCaprio ’s assertion of a “ 90 - percent consensus . ” “ Consensus ” was rarely questioned by reporters at all , and ABC ’s Bill Weir even used DT concept of “ these 4,000 or so NNS ” to hammer at CD person expressing a different view . DT NN did a terrible job of actually explaining what DT IPCC was . Atmospheric scientist Dr. John Christy told NNP & Sky Web site WDT DT “ IPCC MD do well to define what each participant truly contributes to each product ( i.e. Summary for Policy Makers vs. Full Text ) so IN DT NN MD VB IN thousands of NNS never reached a ‘ consensus ’ on anything . ” “ When DT Full Text is developed , ‘ consensus ’ is a concept held by DT chapters ’ Lead Authors who often ignore or contradict positions offered by DT Contributing Authors and Reviewers , ” explained Christy . David Henderson , a former chief economist of DT Organisation for NNP Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , wrote a detailed criticism of DT IPCC in DT Oct. 11 , 2007 Wall Street Journal .

Likely , those costs will be passed on to DT consumer in DT form of higher vehicles prices . Other plans to curb greenhouse - gas NNS MD cost trillions of dollars . CD estimate by business consulting firm CRA International put a $ 4 - trillion to $ 6 - trillion price tag on DT Lieberman - Warner bill , which MD mandate scaling back NNS levels to 1990s levels by 2020 . DT MD cost each American man , woman and child $ 494 a NN . Network reporters RB did n’t focus on how much is already being spent . As DT Business & NNP Institute reported in its “ Fire and NN ” NN , more than 99.5 percent of American NN NN funding comes from DT NN – taxpayers – and PRP spend $ 4 billion per NN on NN NN research . DT Kyoto treaty WDT was never ratified by DT U.S. carried an estimated cost of $ 440 billion per NN for America . DT Senate voted 95 to 0 to reject PRP . BMI examined all ABC , CBS and NBC NN transcripts WDT included DT terms “ JJ NN ” or “ NN NN ” during DT most recent six month period – from July 1 , 2007 , to Dec. 31 , 2007 . Only stories mentioning those terms were included in DT NN . DT stories were split into two categories : stories and casual mentions . Casual mentions encompassed anchor briefs shorter than 50 words and longer stories WDT only mentioned JJ NN or NN NN incidentally ( DT story was not about DT issue ) . “ Dissent , ” for DT purpose of this NN , included any uncertainty [ "" I do n’t VB "" ] , alternative opinions about NN , and caution against making NN NN policy decisions without more information . PRP RB included criticism of “ solutions ” to JJ NN and “ awareness ” campaigns IN Live NNP ¬– even when DT critic was n’t disagreeing with manmade NN NN , but just DT usefulness of worldwide rock concerts . NNS quoted in a story WDT supported NN NN claims were placed in DT proponent category because their comments were used by DT network to support DT manmade JJ NN viewpoint . EX was CD exception .

B.o.B , born Bobby Ray Simmons Jr. , is a rapper from Georgia who once recorded a diss track about physicist Neil deGrasse Tyson , after DT two got into a Twitter fight in 2016 about whether DT NNP is round . DT rapper is a member of DT Flat NNP Society , a group of NNS who are convinced IN DT NN is flat , not round . A scroll through B.o. B's Twitter feed RB reveals a number of other NN beliefs : He is an anti-vaxxer , a 9/11 truther and RB , for some reason , believes IN oil does not form from DT remains of organic material buried under pressure . B.o.B's JJ GoFundMe has a $ 1 million goal and has raised $ 2,701 from 98 NNS in DT five days since he put up DT request . ( He pledged DT first $ 1,000 himself . ) DT goal , according to DT rapper , is to launch a satellite as far into space as necessary to "" find DT curve "" of NNP . [ 7 Ways to Prove DT NNP Is Round ( Without Launching a Satellite ) ] How PRP VBP DT NNP is round Despite myths about Christopher Columbus believing he might sail off DT edge of DT NNP , humans have known IN DT NN is round for a very , very long NN . DT Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras left DT first written arguments for a round NNP in 500 B.C. Ancient Greeks thought DT sphere was DT perfect shape , so PRP stood to reason , Pythagoras figured , IN DT NNP was spherical . A few hundred NNS later , according to DT American Physical Society ( APS ) , Aristotle dropped some scientific evidence into DT debate . He pointed out IN during lunar eclipses , NNP 's shadow on DT moon is curved ; ships VBG over DT horizon seem to drop down , hull - first , rather than becoming tinier and tinier until PRP disappear ; and different stars are visible from different vantage points on NNP , which MD n't make much sense if DT NN were flat . DT Greek mathematician Eratosthenes , born in 276 B.C. , even managed to determine DT circumference of DT NNP . He did this , according to DT APS , by measuring DT angle of DT shadow of a stick stuck in DT ground on DT summer solstice in Alexandria , on what is today DT Egyptian coast . He knew IN in Aswan , Egypt ( then known as Syene ) , DT sun cast no shadows on DT day of DT solstice — PRP was directly overhead . DT difference in DT sun 's angle between Syene and Alexandria corresponded to CD - fiftieth of a complete circle , so Eratosthenes realized IN if he knew DT exact distance between DT two cities , he 'd just need to multiply to determine DT full circumference of DT NNP . DT mathematician had to hire surveyors to walk DT distance with precisely measured steps , but he eventually landed on a total circumference for DT NN of between 24,000 and 29,000 miles ( 39,000 to 47,000 kilometers ) . He turned out to be remarkably accurate : Around DT equator , DT NN 's circumference is 24,900 miles ( 40,072 km ) . So if DT ancient Greeks had PRP figured out , how can anyone still believe in a flat NNP in DT age of satellites and rocket launches ? [ Top 10 NN Theories ] DT resurgence of flat - NNP beliefs started in DT early 1800s with a writer named Samuel Rowbotham , who developed an entire alternative cosmology around DT idea IN DT NNP is a flat plane enclosed by a dome of space , surrounded by a perimeter of NN walls . Rowbotham 's philosophy was IN DT NNP looks flat , from a human 's point of view walking on DT surface , so everyone who VBD PRP MD show otherwise must be lying . DT International Flat NNP Society , formed in 1956 , draws from Rowbotham 's views . In DT mid-1990s , DT NN of DT group claimed to have 3,500 paying members , according to his NNP York Times obituary . Today , DT Flat NNP Society website claims to have 555 members , DT most recent being B.o.B . Flat - Earthers do n't trust NASA or any other space agency . According to DT Flat NNP Society 's FAQs , astronauts are being bribed or coerced into lying ; airplane windows distort views to make PRP look IN DT horizon curves ; and DT International Space Station is a hoax . RB , gravity is n't real . An independent satellite launch MD or MD not convince B.o. B IN DT NNP really does curve , but he MD find DT process a bit difficult if he does n't accept IN DT NN is round . To launch a satellite ( or any other object ) into space , PRP have to take into account DT NNP 's radius . In DT formula for DT speed needed to achieve orbit , V = sqrt ( g0 * IN ^ 2 / ( IN + h ) ) , "" IN "" is DT mean planetary radius . Astronomer Johannes Kepler sorted this out in DT 1600s , according to NASA . PRP remains to be seen whether B.o. B will ever VB a chance to launch a satellite , anyway . According to DT Verge , GoFundMe has frozen DT rapper 's donation account , meaning he wo n't be able to access DT funds unless he can provide more information WDT DT money will not be mismanaged ."

Those who believe in PRP most likely misinterpret DT evidence and are only looking for beliefs WDT MD confirm their owns . This is RB called confirmation bias . In this case PRP ignore DT real evidence IN DT NN is round and label them as ‘ fake ’ , whereas when something in any way MD support their beliefs has to be correct .

DT flat NNP model started in DT ancient where JJ cultures believed in a flat NNP “ until DT classical DT Bronze Age ” ( Wikipedia ) .

Thank_VBP you_PRP ._.","With every interesting celestial event these days , Christian prophecy theorists take to YouTube to share their speculation on why it's a "" sign "" and what PRP might just mean . But does God really communicate warnings this way in DT sun , moon and stars ? Does DT Bible really instruct PRP to look for "" signs "" in DT heavens ? What are PRP to "" watch "" for according to Jesus ? As PRP will learn , theorists ( unintentionally ) deceive themselves and others when PRP do n't properly define and use DT word "" sign "" DT same way DT Bible does . VB Scriptural answers to these important questions , ones WDT PRP wo n't find on YouTube no matter how JJ "" views "" a video has ... Since DT Christian speculation over DT "" four blood moons "" lunar eclipses of 2014 - 2015 failed and neither DT Great Tribulation nor DT Rapture happened as predicted , PRP 're still here . DT means now PRP VBP to discuss similar speculation about DT latest solar eclipse or celestial event . Are PRP ready ? Once again , PRP 's all thanks to YouTube ... Yes , DT same wonderful YouTube WDT brings PRP : • any song or music video from your childhood PRP VBP to experience again , • instructional videos to fix anything and everything in your life , ... RB brings PRP theories WDT either were dismissed with DT arrival of NNP or WDT are too obviously contrived to ever spread through other channels WDT cost money or by free channels WDT are limited to much - less - persuasive text ( IN DT original Web 1.0 ) . Why do PRP VB flat NNP theory is in a resurgence ? ( No , NASA did not develop a NN machine and bring back medieval NNS and teach them to blog . ) PRP 's because free video allows any "" thought "" ( using DT term loosely ) to VB bolstered up by convincing charts , photos and DT silver tongues of persuasive on - screen personalities . Flat - earther Christians began emailing me in early 2015 right after a now popular YouTube video on DT topic was posted : • 2015 , first flat - earther to write me : "" I have n't seen PRP write about DT E yet , which by DT way , fits way better with bible teachings . "" • 2016 , same person after writing a flat NNP article for him : "" Please cancel ALL emails to me . PRP are a and obviously have spent no NN on researching DT flat NNP . "" Likewise , because of YouTube , prophetic speculation is spreading about DT latest interesting eclipse . PRP 's even popular enough to break into mainstream NN just IN DT 2014 - 2015 speculation did . I say "" interesting "" eclipse because EX are several eclipses ( lunar or solar ) every NN WDT are simply ignored by our helpful YouTube "" watchmen . "" Unless a celestial event has something extra ( IN taking place on Jewish holy days or happening seven NNS away from something else interesting ) then PRP wo n't see a prophecy video on PRP . Eclipses are far too common to form DT basis of a prophecy theory every single NN PRP happen . But DT 2017 solar eclipse is an interesting NN . Here are some of DT factoids talked about this eclipse — along with my responses to help PRP VB about them more critically yourself : • Claim : "" DT next total solar eclipse in America is in seven NNS and forms an X when combined with this eclipse . These eclipses MD be marking out DT seven NN Tribulation ! "" Response : Where does DT Bible say to look for eclipses to mark DT Tribulation ? Nowhere . What does PRP tell PRP to expect first ? Jesus already VBD , "" when PRP see DT Abomination of Desolation "" DT Great Tribulation is next ( Mt 24:15 ) . Further , DT seven - NN - long 70th Week of Daniel cannot start this NN as numerous prerequisites have not happened , IN DT Nuclear Middle East War , Elijah 's coming , and most importantly DT Good NNP of DT Kingdom returning ( Mt 24:14 ) ( more on DT below ) . • Claim : "" DT solar eclipse happens DT day before DT start of DT Hebrew month of Elul . "" Response : "" Day before "" is kind of random and arbitrary . MD n't DT eclipse need to happen on Elul 1 itself if PRP VBP to connect PRP to DT past historical prophetic events of DT day ? DT 's what was done in 2014 - 2015 with eclipses on DT very days of Passover and Sukkot by Mark Biltz . This NN Mr. Biltz is happy enough with "" DT day before "" to make a connection . This is a logical fallacy called "" moving DT goal posts . "" • Claim : "" Jonah left for Nineveh on DT day of Elul 1 after EX was a major solar eclipse in Nineveh DT month before . "" Response : See above IN DT eclipse is not on DT day of Elul 1 , so to be consistent , PRP must throw out any connection to Elul . As for "" DT month before "" claim ( generously granting IN DT dating of this ancient event is reliable ) , why MD DT Ninevites connect Jonah 's arrival with an eclipse an entire month before ? To reasonably expect NNS to connect an eclipse to something , IN something needs to happen at DT same NN , such as right as Jonah arrived and started warning . Again , moving goal posts . ( For a great depiction of something IN this , see Mel Gibson 's movie Apocalypto and how a solar eclipse causes DT pagans to VB plans immediately . ) • Claim : "" DT solar eclipse is 40 days from Yom Kippur "" Response : Actually , PRP 's 41 days before Yom Kippur because PRP comes DT day before Elul 1 which itself always starts DT "" 40 days of awe / repentance "" before Yom Kippur , yes ? But even if PRP was 40 days , so what ? Elul 1 comes every NN without event . Eclipses come every NN without event . Nothing in Scripture connects general eclipses with prophecy . • Claim : "" NNP War 1 started in August , 1914 DT same month EX was a total solar eclipse over DT Ottoman Empire ( E. Europe ) which ended with WW1 . "" Response : Why is "" same month "" significant ? As stated above , PRP 's tenuous at best to connect an eclipse to any event WDT is not concurrent . Further , EX have been half a dozen total solar eclipses in Europe since WW1 , so why have PRP not had WW3 - WW7 already ? Because this WW1 eclipse claim comes from another logical fallacy called cherry - picking data . • Claim : "" DT last NN an eclipse crossed only DT NNP NNPS was during WW1 on August 21 , 1914 "" Response : I guess DT implication here is IN "" trouble "" is coming again this NN ? If this is how PRP works based on WW1 , what happened to DT total solar eclipse across DT continent before WW2 ?? I guess EX 's not much of a pattern here when PRP include all DT data but instead just draw a circle around DT data WDT fits your theory , RB called DT Texas Sharpshooter fallacy . • Claim : "" DT path of DT solar eclipse passes over counties WDT 95 % voted for NNP "" Response : What , PRP mean God is using DT Sun to highlight his approval of NNP ? Albeit only 95 % approval ... haha . I thought he was DT Messiah , er , Cyrus LOL . ( I am not against NNP per se , just some NNS take their adoration of him too far , in my opinion . ) • Claim : "" DT path of DT solar eclipse passes over SEVEN towns called Salem ! "" Response : What , PRP mean God is using DT Sun to highlight his approval of NNP ? Albeit only 95 % approval ... haha . I thought he was DT Messiah , EX are JJ , JJ more claims than this about DT eclipse because , just IN with DT 2012 Mayan Calendar speculation , as more NNS hear DT idea , PRP perceive more connections of their own WDT spawn more YouTube videos . DT above most frequently repeated claims are enough to see how arbitrary and subjective DT "" evidence "" is for this eclipse being prophetically significant . Q : "" What are DT odds ? PRP ca n't be just a coincidence ! "" A : No PRP 's not a coincidence but DT odds are not as great as PRP VBP when PRP understand what PRP really is ! As DT section above illustrated , DT "" connections "" WDT are made to support DT "" significance "" of DT eclipse or other event use inconsistent rules . In other words , PRP use inconsistent rules and logic to connect whatever PRP can remember or imagine or Google WDT MD impress NNS . • If DT event falls same day as a Biblical holy day ... bingo ! • If PRP comes DT day before a biblical date ... close enough , bingo ! • If PRP comes DT same month as something else big ... bingo ! • If PRP comes seven NNS before something ... bingo ! Obviously , when PRP employ flexible , moving goalposts or "" rules "" IN this , PRP are able to find interesting factoids for any event or date PRP believe is significant . This is what happened with DT 2012 Mayan Calendar date , and DT 2014 - 2015 Four Blood Moons theory and PRP VBP how these turned out despite DT claim , "" DT odds of all these connections are astronomical ! This happens not because of legitimate coincides but rather due to a human psychological bias called Confirmation Bias . This bias causes PRP to ignore or reject evidence against our theory and accept and report all DT evidence for PRP . Even when NNS present evidence against our theory ( IN this article ! ) their bias will use flexible rules and other moving goalposts to reject DT evidence against PRP . For example , here 's another claim about DT 2017 total solar eclipse regarding DT name Salem : Seven towns named Salem . So what , right ? But wait , PRP found a verse to tie PRP to DT eclipse . Drum roll again , please ... Look at DT , will PRP , DT word Salem is last part of DT word Jerusalem and it's connected to an eclipse ! "" What are DT odds ? "" DT odds are very high indeed when PRP can "" cheat "" by matching any aspect of an eclipse to any part of any word in DT Bible even remotely related to an eclipse . Contrivances IN this only demonstrate DT imagination and research genius of DT prophecy theorist to justify their event as important . PRP do n't provide any real Biblical proof IN DT event is prophetically significant . By DT way , real Biblical evidence for an event 's prophetic significance MD be along DT lines of a direct quote from Jesus . IN him saying , "" When PRP see X , then DT end shall come . "" Turns out Jesus VBD something exactly IN DT , but not about an eclipse ! ( More below . ) Prophecy theories IN this are not just based on specific claims about a particular eclipse or other celestial event . DT theorists RB quote numerous Biblical passages to justify their unusual focus on heavenly events in DT first place . ( Again , see DT film Apocalypto for a reminder of how DT pagans viewed eclipses . PRP MD say Christians fearing eclipses again today is "" retro "" but in a negative way , much IN flat NNP theory is retro . P.S. No judgment on DT NNS , just DT ideas PRP believe and , too often , beat other believers up over . ) For an example of DT "" heavenly "" focus verses PRP employ , look at this partial transcription of a "" biblical astronomy "" YouTube video and see if PRP can spot any problems with DT reasoning before I point them out : Sounds reasonable , does n't PRP ? At least to most JJ to prophecy NN . PRP 's persuasive enough for JJ of them to hit DT share button and send PRP to others to help warn them or ask their opinion . ( I VBP for me I only ever watch a prophecy teaching on YouTube because someone shared PRP to ask my opinion of PRP . ) DT transcript above leads to a false conclusion to justify looking to DT heavens for God 's direction such as with eclipses . Here 's DT problems with DT arguments above : • Psalm CD tells PRP DT heavens declare something , and it's a pretty broad concept at DT : "" God 's glory . "" PRP uses a lot of poetic language ( IN anthropomorphism ) to emphasize this . But EX is no literal speech or language or communication on DT level from DT sky . EX is enough expanse RB for humanity to realize God exists and to be "" without excuse "" in denying this fact and disobeying him as Paul VBD ( Rom 1:20 ) . DT 's PRP for DT normal , daily basis IN DT psalm is commenting on ( with two rare exceptions , see 3 below ) . • Because of this , DT heavens cannot ever serve as a way for God to "" speak "" intelligibly to his NNS . For nearly all of PRP , space is just a random bunch of balls of light with different names , sizes and illumination levels . A few of these balls have vague or general historical meanings IN DT Signs of DT Zodiac do . What PRP means when PRP light up or crisscross is anybody 's guess , and guess away PRP do ! This is why EX are a million and CD subjective opinions on "" what DT eclipse means "" shared by prophecy theorists . • DT Bible already answers DT question posed on how God has and will speak "" to all his NNS "" when DT need comes to do DT : through his end NN prophet Elijah and lastly through seven literal thundering shouts of his voice ( Ps 29:3 = Rev 10:4 ) right before he brings his Kingdom to NNP at DT 7th trumpet ( Rev 11:15 ) . Oh , God can speak to all his NNS at once with clear , human language when he wants to . He did this with all of ancient Israel at Mount Sinai and PRP consequently asked him to "" please , stop "" out of fear ( Ex 20:19 ) . As PRP can tell , apart from God 's greatness , DT heavens do not communicate much at all very clearly to PRP humans . This is why God uses several other much better means to talk to humanity . As noted above , all these means use actual , real , human language . If God spoke in a way any less clear than DT , no NN MD be held accountable to act on his instructions or warnings . PRP MD rightly claim PRP did not understand because his "" heavenly lights language "" was incomprehensible . But what about all those "" sign "" verses ? Does n't sign mean a message as with a "" For Sale "" "" sign ? "" Does n't God use DT lights in DT heavens to at least send simple informational warnings of end times events ? Not quite . Let 's look at DT common verses WDT are used to justify drawing attention to eclipses and other heavenly displays . DT thrust of Genesis 1:14 is IN DT heavenly lights MD signal common divisions of NN : "" seasons , days and NNS . "" In DT Bible , DT month is based on DT moon ; months begin with DT JJ ( crescent ) moon . Days begin when DT sun sets or disappears . Stars in DT sky VBP based on DT season PRP are in . NNS RB can be marked by DT solstices , or shortest or longest days of DT NN . DT 's what Genesis in context means by letting them be all things dealing with DT calendar . PRP says nothing about "" let them be for prophetic warning signs from God "" IN prophecy theorists wrongly wield ( proof - text ) DT verse to mean . In both of these passages DT word for sign MD RB be translated as "" miracle , "" "" token "" or "" wonder . "" Notice IN none of those words convey DT idea of "" communication / speech / warning "" as is portrayed by prophecy theorists . DT point of DT word is IN EX is a attention - catching display in DT sky . PRP 's called a "" wonder "" because PRP makes NNS "" wonder "" due to PRP being unclear and hard to explain . Further , if PRP read Luke 21:25 in context , PRP do not find instructions to look for this sign to mean anything . PRP comes at DT end of God 's wrath , right before DT Jesus appears . PRP 's certainly proper to have a nice heavenly fanfare before his triumphant return . By then PRP 'll already VB DT day he 's coming . Revelation 12 goes on to explain DT meaning of DT great signs of DT Woman and DT Dragon . DT Dragon is DT constellation Draco and RB Satan . DT Woman RB works at JJ levels including DT constellation Virgo , Mary and saints of Israel and of DT Church . PRP shows plainly IN DT Woman gives birth to DT Messiah who later is "" taken up "" to heaven ( Acts 1:9 = Rev 12:5 ) . EX is no connection in any way given between DT Woman in heaven and DT end times events . Later after she is found on DT NN fleeing from DT Dragon , she is indeed an end NN character , too . DT sign in DT sky she portrayed earlier is never connected to her end NN actions and existence . When NNS make such a connection PRP read into DT text what is not RB , ignoring what is RB as PRP did connecting September 23 , 2017 with Revelation 12 . As DT previous section explained , when PRP look at DT "" signs "" verses in context , PRP do not support DT meaning for which PRP are used by Christian prophecy inventors . Each verse refers to a specific instance and application , such as calendar signs and DT DT sign on DT day Jesus returns . PRP are not meant to give "" carte blanche "" or a blank check to justify "" scanning DT heavens for any sign "" IN Christian theorists do . All DT was obvious to me long ago and I have written on PRP before . Thinking deeper on this topic , I began I see another problem . DT meaning of DT word translated "" sign "" in our English Bible versions does not support DT definition WDT prophecy theorists use PRP for . Sign , IN JJ words , has several valid , possible literal meanings and connotations . A sign can have a short message in PRP IN a billboard or "" For Sale "" sign does ( "" $ 1000 call 555-1212 "" ) . Or a sign can mean something as limited as a signal light to indicate your engine is malfunctioning or IN DT day is over IN a sunset does . Which NN is DT Bible intending ? Let 's clear up DT confusion on DT right definition of DT English word "" sign "" to use : • Prophecy Theorists : Sign = "" communication or message from God "" much IN a "" billboard "" or "" God 's day timer "" ( to borrow from DT title of Mark Biltz 's book where he teaches watching for heavenly signs on God 's calendar among other things ) . • DT Bible : Sign = "" wonder , display , token , signal "" again , much IN a sunset or a car 's dashboard engine warning light . Here 's what DT problem is with prophecy theorists ' portrayal of celestial "" signs "" with their limited and specific meanings in their context : PRP 's UH when our car 's designated engine warning light goes off and PRP decide PRP means PRP need to call our mom because she misses PRP . In other words , PRP reject DT simple , limited , contextual meaning of DT sign and expand PRP to be not just something else from left field , but a complete communication IN "" Aww ... Mom misses me . I need to call her . "" Meanwhile , all DT engine light indicates is something quite vague and limited : something is wrong with DT engine ! DT final nail in DT coffin of DT approach of DT prophecy theorists is IN as PRP VBP about inventing JJ end NN signs based on NASA charts and historical factoids , PRP completely ignore DT CD precursor end NN sign WDT Jesus gave PRP . DT sign is found hidden away in a single , puzzling verse in DT middle of DT Olivet Discourse : "" This "" gospel of DT Kingdom ? "" Which NN was DT again ? "" Exactly ! Until 2016 I did not VB DT answer to DT , either . PRP had me stumped , too . PRP 's not our fault . Christianity does not teach any such "" this gospel of DT Kingdom "" or PRP MD not respond with blank stares when asking what PRP is . Christianity certainly teaches "" good NN about Jesus "" just not DT good NN of Jesus , PRP VBP , DT NN WDT he taught on DT rewards God gives NNS now who seek DT coming Kingdom and God 's righteousness ( Mt 6:33 ) . VBG further , if Christianity did teach DT Good NNP of Jesus already , Jesus MD not indicate PRP as an end NN sign . PRP 'd somehow have to VB exactly when PRP reaches "" all nations , "" which PRP can never VB for sure or easily . But if DT Good NN message of DT Kingdom died out with Jesus and DT apostles , then when PRP reappears on DT NNP in our NN , PRP then have a distinct clear and recognizable , unprecedented - in - 2000 - NNS sign . PRP will be so amazing IN DT worldwide spread of PRP in this social NN / YouTube age is ensured . PRP wo n't be able to miss PRP . If PRP VBP to understand this important topic fully now , see DT NN in my supporters section . Finally , Here 's DT Real Role of Eclipses In End NN Prophecy ! By DT way , DT Good NNP of DT Kingdom message will contain a built - in extra reason to "" obey PRP "" ( 2Th 1:8 ) . I 'm referring to DT warning on end NN events . In our NN , PRP do n't just need to repent to be saved , but RB to follow God 's end NN escape instructions to survive what 's coming . Here 's DT kicker . Interestingly enough , CD of first events of DT end NN "" beginning of sorrows "" ( perhaps simultaneous with an earthquake or directly follow PRP ) WDT Jesus warned about affecting DT whole NNP is ... But not just any eclipse . In fact , PRP 's VBG to be a weird combined , simultaneous solar and lunar eclipse : Joel and Revelation both agree IN , somehow , both DT sun and moon will be eclipsed at DT same NN . Of course DT is impossible today and I doubt most ( if any ) on NNP will be able to witness both . For a typical lunar eclipse , DT sun and moon must be on opposite sides of DT NNP . A solar eclipse at DT same NN MD require another celestial body to be very near to NNP in order to block DT sun . Or perhaps DT object blocks DT sun for both DT moon and NNP ... However exactly PRP happens , such a JJ foreign body is identified by Revelation later ( and only after analyzing PRP 's JJ literal clues ) as a dwarf NN PRP calls Wormwood ( Rev 8:10 - 11 ; Note IN DT Greek word aster translated "" star "" is not specific to a star but can mean among other things planets of various sizes ) . Notice RB in context IN even this unprecedented combination lunar and solar eclipse does not happen as an isolated incident . A great earthquake , so great IN PRP shifts DT NNP 's entire topography significantly , RB occurs with PRP . Not to mention so JJ shooting stars WDT DT normal starry night sky scrolls away . How is this possible ? DT dwarf NN Wormwood is broken up at NNP 's Roche Limit and partially disintegrates . PRP can then literally "" fall from heaven "" upon DT NNP ( Rev 8:10 ) . PRP 's dispersed slowly enough in small enough chunks to not end all life on NNP right then and RB . Now is PRP a "" sign ? "" Revelation does not use DT word but again , in DT JJ meaning of DT word sign , PRP MD say among DT first "" signs "" of Wormwood is a unique double eclipse . But PRP 'll already VB PRP 's coming because of Elijah ( and already be in safety in Judea as Psalm 91 depicts ) . So in CD way PRP is but DT way theorists look to eclipses to tell them DT end ahead of NN , PRP 's definitely not . Seeing this all in context , can PRP understand how incorrect PRP is for prophecy theorists to quote those verses above to support their attention to isolated eclipses ( even if four similar ones happen in a row ) IN PRP did in 2014 - 2015 ? Can PRP understand how PRP 's DT same as seeing DT dashboard engine indicator light VB on , ignoring its "" check engine "" - label context and deciding PRP means something completely different outside DT car ? If PRP feel IN PRP 're done with YouTube prophecy videos and ready to understand end NN prophecy literally , comprehensively and in context , including all DT details on Wormwood ( 3rd trumpet ) and DT rest of DT seven seals , seven trumpets and seven bowls , order my book VB DT Future and begin reading ( DT bonus eBook version ) instantly while DT softcover version makes its way to PRP printed and shipped by Amazon 's CreateSpace in South Carolina . PRP 'll be directly blessing yourself and others by supporting my further writing on this site . Thank PRP ."

DT citizens of those NNS practice birth control , which brought their birth rates down to 2.0 or less in DT past 45 NNS . While Western thinking and intelligent action created stable societies , DT rest of DT NN roared ahead by adding 3.5 billion in those 45 NNS and continues with 80 million , net gain , annually , or 1 billion added every 12 NNS . And , no end in sight as humans see a projected 3.1 billion more within 36 NNS by 2050 .  Most Western elites continue urging DT wealthy West not to stem DT migrant tide [ WDT adds 80 million net gain annually to DT NN ] , but to absorb our JJ brothers and sisters until their horrid ordeal has been endured and shared by allten billion humans packed onto an ecologically devastated NN . Dr. Otis Graham , Unguarded Gates Annually , 18 million starve to death and at least 2 billion live within DT human misery index of daily NN and food scarcity . Notwithstanding , PRP keep reproducing without end , means or understanding . Those folks continue adding 80 million annually , so , in order to save themselves , PRP export endless millions of their numbers into stable Western NNS who chose 2.0 birth rates . In DT meantime , not CD NN leader addresses PRP . Not CD Western leader touches DT subject . Immigration remains DT last taboo right up RB with DT  NNP is flat ;  Adam and Eve constitute DT first humans ;  DT Bible is DT final say ;  DT sun and universe rotates around DT Earth as spoken by DT Pope ; and finally , lets not deal with global NN change or DT fact IN PRP face complete  Peak Oil NN exhaustion within 40 NNS . If PRP ignore PRP , DT whole mess will VB away . Answer : not on your life ! Some of PRP deal with immigration because PRP not only adds to Canada , America , Europe and Australias final horrific population expansions the added numbers from DT Third NNP , when PRP reach DT First NNP , PRP begin to quintuple their use of resources thus magnifying DT carbon footprint , NN footprint , resource footprint and NN footprint . Not by a little , but by an exponential growth factor second to none . Therefore , immigration into DT West creates a nightmare . What might DT nightmare mean ? PRP means DT Third NNP keeps using DT First NNP for a human exhaust vent . In DT end , DT West ultimately faces duplicating DT Third NNP in overpopulation and resource usage . PRP wont be pretty folks . A reader responded to my last missive ,  Once again , someone claims IN any focus on immigration to DT NNP NNPS is a meaningless distraction . In effect , he - she is saying IN DT annual addition of more than 30 million consumers to DT third most populous and industrialized nation on NN is irrelevant . Moreover , since all nations and all JJ citizens will be subject to an NN contraction , building walls will not insulate PRP from DT impact .  This stance is not credible . If NN deliveries will contract , PRP is ever more imperative to contract DT number of consumers in America , or at DT very least , prevent DT NNP population from growing . Each additional American citizen will reduce DT per capita share of non-renewable resources . PRP MD not be able to solve DT NN crisis , but surely PRP can't stand by and allow DT crisis to be accelerated by an indifference to immigration growth .  He or she hopes to reduce population levels by a grassroots approach , by building a "" belief consensus "" for population reduction among target groups , IN "" grandmothers "" who are not in DT breeding phase of life . But how do PRP sell birth control to NNS who look around and see their own communities bulge with immigrants , legal and illegal ? How do PRP tell DT Smiths and DT Jones ' IN PRP should not have NNS when DT Sanchez family down DT block is having five ?  As CD of my critics told me , governments are determined to grow DT population by CD means or another . If citizens choose not to birth NNS at a replacement level , then governments will import them . "" I prefer to have my own NNS than to outsource DT job to immigrants "" , she VBD . This is a natural reaction . If PRP do n't reduce immigration , PRP can't convince NNS to remain childless in DT interest of population control .  BTW , regarding target audiences . Have PRP ever met a grandmother or grandfather who was n't absolutely delighted at DT prospect of having a grandchild ?  Let 's VB real . Controlling migration is DT most efficient method of controlling or reducing population growth . "" But how does DT affect population levels ?  he or she asked . DT answer is IN open borders are a proven fertility stimulant to those NNS , which rely on massive emigration to relieve their population pressures and gain remittance money . DT Philippines and Haiti are a case in point . Migration promotes JJ population growth . Fellow humans , this writer puts PRP into logical perspective . PRP cannot and will not survive our current path . I guarantee PRP . PRP better move this issue to DT top of DT national conversation .

"" PRP should embarrass PRP , PRP should embarrass your families , PRP should embarrass DT fine schools PRP went to — Davidson and Duke , in DT same NN . PRP should embarrass DT NBA . PRP 's not a position to take . "" PRP remains unclear if Curry was joking or not . Irving later rescinded his comments and apologized ."

Except PRP turns out not to be DT only theory of its kind : through DT NNS , online sleuths have found IN all sorts of places do n’t exist . High on DT list is Finland , DT country some believe lies between Russia and Sweden , and WDT allegedly fought a valiant rearguard action against Soviet invasion in DT runup to DT second NN war . This theory was RB born on Reddit , in 2015 . Finland , DT user Raregan explained , was merely a fictional creation designed to create fishing quotas to aid DT export of sushi to Japan from Russia . Last summer , another Reddit user suggested DT Italian region of Molise – population 300,000 – does n’t exist , apparently as DT result of an Italian in - joke , while Brazilians have had for at least five NNS an online theory IN DT north - western NN of Acre does n’t exist or else is a land WDT NN forgot , still populated by dinosaurs . DT joke – or painstakingly well - evidenced and argued theory – IN a country or region does n’t exist turns out to be CD of DT oldest memes on DT internet . As early as 1993 , German users of Usenet – a network of online discussion forms ( or bulletin boards ) , which predates DT web – had a running joke IN DT Westfalian town of Bielefeld ( population 300,000 , funnily enough ) was a fiction maintained by DT CIA , Mossad , aliens or some combination of DT three . DT joke has crossed decades , online platforms , language barriers and international cultures , and keeps coming back . “ DT beauty of memes is IN PRP are malleable and everyone can have their own spin on things and VB involved in DT joke , ” says writer Mollie Goodfellow . “ I VBP PRP says IN PRP all VBP to be in on DT joke , especially online , where often different cliques and subgroups can form . ” In these days of fake NN and mainstream - NN conspiracies , though , PRP does n’t do to take anything for granted – so G2 contacted a diplomatic source , who agreed to speak off DT record and confirm what PRP MD about DT existence ( or otherwise ) of Finland and Australia . “ Hang on , let me look out DT window , ” DT source replied , before confirming Finland existed . DT source was unable to provide similar confirmation for Australia ."

Now , two separate studies show how DT pandemic MD have been slowed down when PRP broke out in NNP if social distancing practices were implemented earlier . To see how governments can better respond to DT pandemic , two separate studies have taken a look at how NNP initially handled PRP . Both indicate IN DT number of infections MD have been much lower — by as much as 95 percent according to CD of DT studies — had DT country implemented social distancing earlier as asymptomatic carriers pose a much more significant risk . As DT source of DT SARS - CoV2 NN responsible for DT outbreak , PRP RB has DT largest number of confirmed NNS at over 81,000 at DT NN of writing . In CD of DT studies , however , researchers estimated IN DT numbers MD have been as high as 114,325 by DT end of February . Early detection and isolation more effective than travel restrictions To take a closer look at how effective NNP ’s containment strategy was and how PRP MD have been better , a team at DT University of Southampton in England built a travel network - based susceptible - exposed - infections - removed ( SEIR ) model to simulate DT outbreak across cities in mainland NNP . DT model was then combined with historical and real - real - NN human movement data from location - based services run by Chinese tech company Baidu . Using DT simulation , DT team gauged DT effectivity of DT various non-pharmaceutical intervention ( NPI ) strategies used by NNP , such as quarantines and social distancing . Here , DT team figured IN , without DT NPIs , EX MD have been a 67 percent increase in DT number of NNS . However , DT NN RB found IN had NNP implemented these measures CD , two or three weeks earlier , PRP MD have reduced DT number of infections 66 , 86 and 95 percent , respectively . This is on top of reducing DT number of areas affected by DT outbreak . What ’s more interesting is IN DT researchers RB looked at DT effectivity of DT individual NPIs . Of DT various methods , PRP was early detection and isolation of NNS WDT proved to be more effective . This finding is in line with what ’s happening in NNP ’s close neighbor South Korea , which has largely kept its outbreak under control , thanks to a massive testing spree but no travel lockdown . DT VBN , DT team is n’t downplaying DT effects of NNP ’s lockdowns on its cities . DT team stated IN a strategy of coordinated NPIs has DT strongest and most rapid containment of DT outbreak . “ Our NN demonstrates how important PRP is for NNS which are facing an imminent outbreak to proactively plan a coordinated response which swiftly tackles DT spread of DT NN on a number of fronts , ” added Dr. Shengjie Lai , a research fellow at DT University of Southampton and CD of DT authors of DT NN . DT results of DT NN at DT University of Southampton line up with those of another NN recently published in DT journal NNP . This NN focused on undocumented NNS of NN - CD in NNP and how PRP helped spread DT infection before DT authorities MD contain PRP . These undocumented NNS consisted of NNS who either had only mild symptoms of DT NN or no symptoms at all . According to researchers at DT Columbia University Mailman School of NNP NNP who conducted DT NN , these NNS can expose a far greater portion of DT population to DT NN than MD otherwise occur . To asses DT full epidemic potential of DT NN , DT team used a computer model to estimate DT proportion and contagiousness of these undocumented NNS during DT weeks before and after NNP ’s lockdown of DT city of Wuhan . In this model , DT spread of DT NN across cities was then simulated using DT mobility data collected by Chinese form Tencent from January 10 to 23 and January 24 to February 8 . Using DT numbers extrapolated from DT model , DT researchers at Columbia found IN 86 percent of all infections were undocumented before travel in and out of Wuhan was shut down on January 23 . DT researchers say IN these undocumented infections were more than half as contagious as documented infections . However , PRP were still DT source for over two - thirds of DT documented infections . “ DT explosion of NN - CD NNS in NNP was largely driven by individuals with mild , limited , or no symptoms who went undetected , ” stated co-author Jeffrey Shaman , professor of environmental NN sciences at Columbia University Mailman School . “ These stealth transmissions will continue to present a major challenge to DT containment of this outbreak VBG forward , ” Shaman added . In late January , NNP implemented a number of measures to stop DT spread of DT NN , including implementing lockdowns of cities such as Wuhan . DT researchers acknowledged IN these , alongside DT NN ’s heightened awareness of DT outbreak and increased use of personal protective measures , have helped slow DT outbreak down . NN MD become endemic , and return IN seasonal NN Despite DT measures implemented by NNP , DT number of undocumented NNS and their effectivity at spreading DT NN has made DT researchers question whether or not efforts by DT Chinese NN MD be enough to contain DT spread of DT NN entirely . Shaman VBD IN he felt PRP was unclear whether DT reductions made by NNP ’s efforts MD be enough to fully stem DT spread of DT NN . He then likened DT ongoing pandemic to DT 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic . RB known as DT “ swine NN , ” DT Centers for NNP Control and Prevention ( CDC ) estimated this pandemic killed around 284,500 NNS . Shaman then stated IN DT NNP - CD pandemic , which has only killed 3,213 as of DT NN of writing , MD end up following DT pattern of DT swine NN pandemic , which MD make PRP DT fifth endemic NN in humans . DT four current endemic coronaviruses , including DT two responsible for DT 2003 to 2004 SARS outbreak , are currently responsible for an estimated CD - quarter of all colds . If this JJ NN does join them as DT fifth , then NNP - CD MD repeatedly return IN DT seasonal NN . “ This is VBG to be with PRP for some NN – PRP ’s endemic in human populations and not VBG to VB away without a NN , ” VBD Amesh Adalja , an infectious - NN expert at DT Johns Hopkins Center for NNP Security , earlier this month . Adalja RB warned IN DT early spread of DT NN in DT U.S. MD have been facilitated by PRP being mistaken as seasonal NN , resulting in NNS not getting tested . With DT JJ studies then , DT NNS are hoping IN DT mistakes in NNP are n’t continued in other NNS and IN DT early , undocumented spread of DT NN is arrested through early testing and social distancing . DT , and if DT NN ever returns seasonally in DT future , NN officials are better prepared to deal with PRP ."

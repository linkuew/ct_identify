Over DT past three NNS , NN NN has become a pillar of DT U.S. - NNP bilateral relationship . Both NNS have taken strong measures at home to build green , low - carbon and NN - resilient economies , helping galvanize JJ action to combat NN NN and culminating in DT Paris Agreement reached last December . With their joint announcement of ambitious NN actions in November 2014 , NNP Barack Obama and NNP Xi Jinping sought to lead by example , and by DT NN DT Paris conference opened a NN later , some 186 NNS had put forward their own NN actions . In September 2015 , DT two leaders laid out a common vision for DT Paris outcome during NNP Xi’s NNP Visit to Washington and RB announced major domestic policy measures and cooperative initiatives to combat NN NN , as well as significant progress on NN finance . In Paris , DT NNP NNPS and NNP , working together and with others , played a critical role in crafting a historic , ambitious JJ NN NN agreement . 2. Today , DT two Presidents announce another significant step in their joint NN efforts . DT NNP NNPS and NNP will sign DT Paris Agreement on April 22nd and take their respective domestic steps in order to join DT Agreement as early as possible this NN . PRP encourage other Parties to DT NNP Nations Framework Convention on NNP NNP to do DT same , with a view to bringing DT Paris Agreement into force as early as possible . DT Presidents further express their commitment to work together and with others to promote DT full implementation of DT Paris Agreement to win DT fight against DT NN threat . 3 . DT Presidents recognize IN DT Paris Agreement marks a JJ commitment to tackling NN NN and a strong signal of DT need for a swift transition to low - carbon , NN - resilient economies . In this regard , DT Presidents are RB committed to working bilaterally and with other NNS to achieve successful outcomes this NN in related multilateral fora , including on an HFC amendment under DT Montreal Protocol pursuant to DT Dubai Pathway and on a JJ market - based measure for addressing greenhouse gas NNS from international aviation at DT International Civil Aviation Organization Assembly . To accelerate clean NN innovation and deployment , PRP will work together to implement DT goals of DT Mission Innovation initiative announced at DT Paris conference and carry forward DT work of DT Clean NNP Ministerial . PRP support a successful G - 20 Summit in Hangzhou this NN , including strong NN and clean NN outcomes , and call on DT G - 20 NNS to engage constructively in international cooperation on NN and NN NN . And PRP will continue to deepen and broaden bilateral cooperation through DT U.S. - NNP NNP NNP Working Group , DT U.S. - NNP Clean NNP Research Center , and other efforts . 4 . Finally , DT Presidents commit to taking concrete steps to implement DT commitments PRP made in their September 2015 Joint Statement to use JJ resources to finance and encourage DT transition toward low carbon technologies as a priority . Since DT Joint Statement , DT NNP NNPS led an effort in DT OECD to successfully adopt DT first - ever set of multilateral standards for support of coal - fired power plants using export credit , and NNP has been strengthening its green and low - carbon policies and regulations with a view to strictly controlling JJ investment flowing into projects with high pollution and carbon NNS both domestically and internationally . 5 . DT joint efforts by NNP and DT NNP NNPS on NN NN will serve as an enduring legacy of DT partnership between our two NNS ."

DT JJ economy has slowed , NNS have retreated to their homes and thousands have died or become seriously ill . At this frightening stage of DT crisis , PRP ’s difficult to focus on anything else . But as DT International Agency has VBN , DT effects of NN are likely to be temporary but DT other JJ emergency – NN NN – is not . Stopping DT spread of NN is paramount , but NN action must RB continue . And PRP can draw JJ lessons and opportunities from DT current NN crisis when tackling planetary NN . S&P NNP Ratings this week VBD measures to contain NNP - CD have pushed DT JJ economy into recession . JJ analyst Lauri Myllyvirta estimates DT pandemic MD have reduced JJ NNS by 200 megatonnes of carbon dioxide to date , as air travel grinds to a halt , factories close down and NN demand falls . In DT first four weeks of DT pandemic , coal consumption in NNP alone fell by 36 % , and oil refining capacity reduced by 34 % . In JJ ways , what PRP ’re seeing now is a rapid and unplanned version of JJ “ degrowth ” – DT transition some academics and activists have for decades VBN is necessary to address NN NN , and leave a habitable NN for future generations . Read more : Life in a ' degrowth ' economy , and why PRP might actually enjoy PRP Degrowth is a proposed slowing of growth in sectors WDT damage DT environment , such as fossil fuel industries , until DT economy operates within NNP ’s limits . PRP is a voluntary , planned and equitable transition in developed nations which necessarily involves an increased focus on DT environment , human well - being , and capabilities ( good NN , decent work , education , and a safe and healthy environment ) . Such a transformation MD be profound , and so far no nation has shown DT will to implement PRP . PRP MD require JJ economies to “ decouple ” from carbon to prevent NN - related crises . But DT current unintended JJ slowdown opens DT door to such a transition , which MD bring myriad benefits to DT NN . DT idea of sustainable degrowth is very different to a recession . PRP involves scaling back environmentally damaging sectors of DT economy , and strengthening others . NN NN has been declared a JJ emergency , yet to date DT NN has largely failed to address PRP . In contrast , DT JJ policy response to DT NN emergency has been fast and furious . EX are several reasons for this dramatic difference . NN NN is a relatively slow - moving crisis , whereas NN visibly escalates over days , even hours , increasing our perception of DT risks involved . CD thing WDT history teaches PRP about politics and DT human condition in times of peril , PRP often take a “ crisis management ” approach to dealing with serious threats . Read more : How changes brought on by NN MD help tackle NN NN As others have observed , DT slow increase in JJ temperatures means humans can psychologically adjust as DT situation worsens , making DT problem seem less urgent and meaning NNS are less willing to accept drastic policy measures . DT JJ response to DT NN crisis shows IN governments can take immediate , radical emergency measures , which VBP beyond purely JJ concerns , to protect DT well - being of all . Specifically , EX are practical lessons and opportunities PRP can take away from DT NN emergency as PRP seek to tackle NN NN : Act early : DT NN pandemic shows DT crucial importance of early action to prevent catastrophic consequences . Governments in Taiwan , South Korea and Singapore acted quickly to implement quarantine and screening measures , and have seen relatively small numbers of infections . Italy , on DT other hand , whose NN waited too long to act , is now DT epicentre of DT NN . Read more : Running out of things to do in isolation ? VB back in DT garden with these ideas from 4 experts VB slow , VB local : NN has forced an immediate scale - down of how PRP travel and live . NNS are forging local connections , shopping locally , working from home and limiting consumption to what PRP need . Researchers have identified IN fears about personal well - being represent a major barrier to political support for DT degrowth movement to date . However with social distancing expected to be in place for months , our scaled - down lives MD become DT “ JJ normal ” . JJ NNS MD realise IN consumption and personal well - being are not inextricably linked . JJ JJ thinking is needed . A transition to sustainable degrowth can help . PRP need to shift JJ attention from GDP as an indicator of well - being , towards other measures WDT put NNS and DT environment first , such as NNP Zealand ’s well - being budget , Bhutan ’s gross national happiness index , or Ecuador ’s social philosophy of buen vivir ( good living ) . Spend on clean NN : DT International NNP Agency ( IEA ) says clean NN should be “ at DT heart of stimulus plans to counter DT NN crisis ” . DT IEA has called on governments to launch sustainable stimulus packages focused on clean NN technologies . PRP says hydrogen and carbon - capture RB need major investment to bring them to scale , which MD be helped by DT current low interest rates . Governments MD RB use NN stimulus packages to reskill workers to service DT JJ “ green ” economy , and address challenges in healthcare , sanitation , aged care , food security and education . As NN scientist Katharine Hayhoe VBD this month : DT NN crisis is devastating , but failing to tackle NN NN because of DT pandemic only compounds DT tragedy . Instead , PRP must draw on DT lessons of NN to address DT NN challenge ."

Researchers are now warning IN DT platypus — DT unusual duck - billed , egg - laying mammal native to eastern Australia whose existence was believed to be a hoax in DT late 18th century — is CD of DT iconic species teetering on DT brink of extinction . According to a JJ NN by DT University of NNP South Wales ( UNSW ) WDT was published in DT scientific journal Biological Conservation , platypus numbers have declined by half or more since DT European colonization of DT island continent with local extinctions occurring across 40 percent of DT species natural habitat thanks to drought and human activity such as dam building , NN harvesting , land clearances , DT impacts of livestock and threats from feral species . Along with other contemporary threats including DT changing NN , NNS fear IN platypus numbers will continue to decline between 47 percent and 66 percent by 2070 . However , when taking fast - heating NN projections into account DT animal ’s decline MD rapidly fall by 51 percent to 73 over DT next five decades — pushing DT species once common in DT country ’s waterways toward all - out extinction . DT danger to platypuses has become alarming in recent consecutive NNS as brutal heatwaves and arid conditions made worse by DT dearth of rainfall have had a devastating effect on local populations . Platypus populations , IN other aquatic species , are believed to have taken major damage from an intensifying drought and record heat , even prior to DT bushfire crisis . AFP reports IN NN co-author Gilad Bino , a researcher at DT University of NSW ’s Centre for Ecosystem NNP , VBD : DT NN recommended IN national authorities give attention to DT “ urgent need ” for a risk assessment WDT MD downgrade DT animal to “ vulnerable ” status and look at DT steps necessary to conserve DT species and “ minimize any risk of extinction . ” DT NN has taken few if any measures to protect DT species despite DT International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) recently downgrading DT nocturnal creature ’s status to “ near threatened . ” DT NN notes IN such conservationist measures MD include “ increasing surveys , tracking trends , mitigating threats and improving management of platypus habitat in rivers . ” DT platypus , along with four species of echidnas , are DT NN ’s only monotremes or egg - laying mammals WDT secrete milk from DT female bellies . Australia ’s ABC reports IN conservationists have seen a precipitous drop in platypus numbers in traditional habitats such as NSW ’s Great Barrington region . Tim Faulkner , DT NN of conservationist group Aussie Ark , VBD : “ In our region , PRP ’re all dead , PRP ’re gone — I ca n’t find them … PRP do n’t VB into hibernation … PRP must have NN to feed in . Private landholder management , DT management of riparian zones along creeks , NN harvest as well as control on stock trampling [ are all required ] . And VBG to DT toilet in DT last fragments of NN [ must RB be controlled ] . Our own parks are full of pests IN DT feral fox and cats responsible for over 90 per cent of all mainland mammal extinction . ” “ DT platypus WDT PRP did rescue , PRP had two die DT next day … Their bellies are empty and PRP ’re all riddled with E. coli and a greater diversity of bacteria than DT . Platypus are a Gondwanan dinosaur species — PRP are monotremes , egg - laying mammals , some of DT oldest lineages of mammals on NN . PRP ’ve been in this constant east coast temperate environment , largely unchanged , for millions of NNS . To see PRP now … a cesspit WDT ’s bacteria ridden and lifeless … certainly in our area — and this must be so wide spread — PRP ’re gone . ” With its unique set of physical features , early sketches of DT duck - billed mammal shocked western NNS who stumbled on DT existence of DT platypus during DT colonization of Australia . Even after DT creature ’s pelt was delivered to researchers in DT U.K. , DT existence of DT platypus was believed to be a hoax comprised of a duck ’s bill sewn onto a beaver ’s body . DT species was then hunted for its fur until DT last century . NN co-author Prof. Richard Kingsford stressed IN NN NN and habit destruction must be reined in . He VBD :"

Moore explained precisely how DT “ Green NNP Deal ” MD end in catastrophe as half DT population starved and every tree on DT NN was eliminated . DT environmentalist took aim at DT progressive congresswoman arguing IN without fossil fuels , “ How do PRP VB DT food to DT center of NNP York , to Manhattan , where AOC is from ? PRP do n’t . ” Moore already denounced DT scientific community WDT supports NNP NNP and NNP NNP , painting PRP as a "" catastrophic theory "" WDT 's being pushed by "" corrupt NNS "" who are "" hooked on NN grants . "" DT former NN of Greenpeace Canada VBD so - called "" green "" companies seize DT narrative to win grants and tax cuts along with favorable reporting across DT NN . Mr. Moore co-founded Greenpeace in DT early 1970s and campaigned for environmental issues for 50 NNS . In 2006 , he wrote to DT Royal Society challenging them IN EX was "" no scientific proof "" humans were causing JJ NN NN and PRP "" has a much better correlation with changes in solar activity than CO2 levels . "" Tucker Carson asked Moore , “ So , PRP ’re CD of DT founders of DT most famous environmental organizations in DT NN , and PRP VBP DT ‘ Green JJ Deal ’ sounds terrifying . Tell PRP why . ” Well , because PRP MD be basically DT end of civilization if 85 % of DT NN ’s and RB 85 % of DT U.S. 's NN in DT form of coal , oil , natural gas were phased out over DT next few NNS , UH ten NNS . PRP do not have anything to replace them with . Yes , if PRP went into a crash course of building nuclear reactors , PRP MD replace them for producing electricity . But DT is n't VBG to happen because DT Greens are against nuclear and PRP are even against hydroelectric dams which at least is renewable . But PRP do n't support DT either . So basically PRP are opposed to approximately 98.5 % of all DT electricity WDT PRP are using and nearly 100 % of all of DT vehicle and transportation and ships and planes NN WDT PRP are using . So when I tweeted DT other day , and PRP had a huge response , over three million impressions on Twitter , I VBD , PRP do n’t have a plan to feed eight billion NNS without fossil fuels or VB DT food into DT cities , where PRP ’s needed . DT requires large trucks , and EX ’s not VBG to be any electric trucks any NN soon hauling forty tons of food into DT supermarkets where DT NNS in DT cities probably VBP PRP originates , in DT supermarket . But PRP does not . PRP ’s coming from farms out in DT country , where a few million NNS are growing DT food for all DT rest of DT population . And if PRP ban fossil fuels , first , agricultural production MD collapse in a very short period of NN . EX are these things called tractors , and PRP use fuel , and all DT other implements on DT farm , and then EX ’s DT transportation . So when PRP have no fuel , how do PRP VB DT food to DT center of NNP York , to Manhattan , where AOC is from ? PRP do n’t . Then DT NNS RB will begin to starve , and DT will spread out as a rot from DT center of DT metropolises all across DT country , and half DT population will die in a very short period . And as I RB pointed out , EX MD n’t be a tree left on this NN . Say this was a worldwide thing , because DT NNP NNPS is not VBG to ban fossil fuels if no NN else does ; but say DT Paris Agreement came into effect , fully all around DT NN and everybody banned fossil fuels , EX MD n’t be a tree left on this NN because DT MD be all EX was for fuel , for heating and cooking , as PRP did in DT old days , when EX was hardly anybody on DT NN compared to what EX is today . So just DT CD point , never mind DT insanity of banning aircraft and fossil fuel - using vehicles . “ Well , PRP ’ve just completely blown my mind . And I knew some of DT , but DT way PRP put PRP was really stirring . ” [ RELATED ] Ocasio - Cortez Arrives in Gas-Guzzling SUV to Lecture Americans on NN NN"

Sign_VB up_RP for_IN the_DT newsletter_NN ._.","In 1916 , Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton was forced to make a treacherous voyage across DT open waters of DT Southern Ocean after his ship Endurance was crushed by pack NN and sank in DT Weddell NNP . Along with five members of his party , Shackleton set out for DT island of South Georgia in a 23 - foot - long wooden lifeboat named DT James Caird . Eleven days into DT trip , on NNP 5 , Shackleton thought he spied a clearing in DT murky sky above . What he was actually seeing was n’t a break in DT clouds , but DT white crest of a monstrous wave bearing down on them . “ During twenty - six NNS ’ experience of DT ocean in all its moods I had not encountered a wave so gigantic , ” Shackleton MD later write in his book South : DT Story of Shackleton ’s Last Expedition 1914 - 1917 . “ PRP was a mighty upheaval of DT ocean , a thing quite apart from DT big white - capped seas WDT had been our tireless enemies for JJ days . ” Shackleton ’s account remains CD of DT most evocative descriptions of DT westerly winds WDT circle DT globe between 30 and 60 degrees latitude in both hemispheres and DT colossal waves PRP whip up in DT Southern Ocean . Today , DT southern westerlies are back in focus for entirely different reasons : their potential impact on NN NN . DT NN ’s oceans take up more than a quarter of DT carbon humans are emitting into DT atmosphere , partially mitigating DT greenhouse effect of DT carbon . And DT Southern Ocean accounts for nearly 40 percent of this marine carbon absorption , even though PRP makes up only CD - fifth of NNP ’s ocean surface area . EX MD be enormous consequences for our already VBG NN from even a small reduction in DT Southern Ocean ’s ability to suck up carbon from DT atmosphere . NNS say this reduction MD already be happening , and PRP suspect IN DT westerlies in DT Southern Hemisphere , which are stronger than their northern counterparts because PRP blow mostly over open NN , are to blame . Records of actual wind speeds , as well as estimates of wind speeds from measurements of atmospheric pressure , provide clear signs IN DT westerlies in both hemispheres are shifting toward DT poles and intensifying . NN models show IN these changes are partly due to JJ NN , and research is afoot to determine if PRP are hindering DT Southern Ocean ’s capacity to pull carbon out of DT atmosphere . “ EX are questions about what ’s VBG to happen if DT winds continue to VB stronger , ” says paleoclimate scientist Krystyna Saunders of DT Australian Nuclear NNP and Technology Organisation in Sydney . “ How much can DT oceans actually absorb ? ” Saunders and her colleagues are finding clues IN over DT past 12,000 NNS of NNP ’s history , higher wind speeds and greater concentrations of carbon dioxide in DT atmosphere have gone together . If this link between wind and CO ₂ holds true today , PRP will lead to higher levels of DT greenhouse gas in DT atmosphere , which will speed up NN NN , which MD further intensify DT westerlies . EX ’s growing evidence IN , at least in DT winter months when DT westerlies are at their most violent , some parts of DT Southern Ocean are giving off more of DT gas than was previously estimated . PRP has all DT makings of a vicious cycle . DT westerlies are DT result of a JJ atmospheric circulation system , starting with what is called DT Hadley cell . DT cell forms as warm , moist air near DT equator rises into DT upper atmosphere and then , as PRP cools and dries , much of PRP sinks down toward NNP at about 30 degrees latitude in each hemisphere . Lower in DT atmosphere , this air moves back toward DT equator , completing DT cell . Some of this downward - moving mass of air escapes DT Hadley cell and moves away from DT equator , and is deflected by NNP ’s rotation , creating DT westerlies . Because DT westerlies form at DT edge of each hemisphere ’s Hadley cell WDT is closest to DT pole , DT bigger DT size of DT cell , DT more DT winds move toward DT pole . Data collected by weather balloons , satellites and other means VBG back to 1960 show IN NNP ’s tropical belt has widened in DT past few decades by a few degrees of latitude , effectively expanding DT size of DT Hadley cells . This is partly due to JJ NN , as predicted by NN models . At DT same NN , DT westerlies have been pushed poleward . With less distance to cover as PRP circle a narrower part of DT globe , DT law of conservation of angular momentum dictates IN DT winds should increase in speed , much IN an NN skater rotates faster when she draws in her arms . And measurements during DT past three decades show IN DT westerlies have , indeed , intensified . As researchers were making sense of these changes to DT westerlies , other NNS began using measurements of CO₂ levels in DT atmosphere to determine whether DT shifting , speedier westerlies are causing a drop in DT amount of CO ₂ being absorbed by DT Southern Ocean . PRP had reason to suppose IN this MD happen . IN any gas , carbon dioxide exerts a pressure WDT depends on DT amount of DT gas relative to other gases in a mixture . If this so - called partial pressure of carbon dioxide ( pCO₂ ) of DT atmosphere is greater than DT pCO ₂ of DT ocean , then DT ocean will absorb carbon from DT atmosphere . Otherwise PRP will release PRP . And as DT westerlies VBP stronger , DT pCO ₂ of DT Southern Ocean MD VB , due to shifts in DT pattern of ocean currents . DT westerlies drive DT Southern Ocean current WDT circles Antarctica . DT predominantly west - to - east current is further acted upon by a force generated by NNP ’s rotation , known as DT Coriolis force , which deflects moving objects to their right in DT Northern Hemisphere and to their left in DT Southern Hemisphere . DT current circling Antarctica is deflected to its left , or northward , pushing DT surface waters away from DT pole . This sets DT stage for NN from deep in DT Southern Ocean to move to DT surface . Up to 80 percent of all DT deep NN WDT returns to DT surface around DT globe makes DT return in DT Southern Ocean . “ PRP ’s unique , ” says NN scientist Joellen Russell of DT University of Arizona in Tucson . “ EX 's nothing IN PRP in DT NN . ” This massive upwelling of DT deeper , carbon - rich waters of DT Southern Ocean increases DT pCO ₂ of DT ocean surface , which decreases its capacity to act as a carbon sink , DT argument goes . But is this what is actually happening ? DT Southern Ocean has been loath to reveal its workings . This is due to DT complicating effects of local wind patterns and DT fact IN researchers are only just beginning to make direct measurements of DT outgassing of CO ₂ during peak winter months RB . So far , DT data paint a somewhat confusing , and concerning , picture . Previous estimates had shown IN between 1981 and 2004 , DT Southern Ocean absorbed about 80 million fewer metric tons of carbon per NN than expected . This was a cause for concern , given IN DT Southern Ocean is “ DT most important marine carbon sink on DT NN , ” says ocean biogeochemist Peter Landschützer of DT Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg , Germany . So Landschützer and his colleagues took a closer look at a JJ database of pCO ₂ values , created from observations of surface waters by instruments deployed in DT NN or carried on research and commercial ships . Known as DT Surface Ocean CO₂ Atlas ( SOCAT ) and established in 2007 , PRP contains almost 26 million observations of JJ oceans and coastal seas from 1957 to 2019 . Since data are sparser for DT earlier decades than for recent NNS , Landschützer ’s team filled in DT gaps using other , less direct but more frequently measured parameters such as NN surface temperature and salinity and their well - understood relationship to pCO ₂ of surface waters . PRP estimated IN DT Southern Ocean had indeed taken in less CO₂ than expected from 1982 to 2001 . DT trend reversed in 2002 , with DT ocean acting as a more vigorous carbon sink all DT way up to 2011 . From 2011 to 2016 , however , DT Southern Ocean went back to being less effective in its carbon absorption . DT team tried to find a link between DT changes in DT Southern Ocean ’s ability to absorb CO ₂ and DT poleward - shifted westerlies . “ PRP were quite surprised IN PRP did not , ” Landschützer says . This called for an explanation , and DT answer turned out to be complicated . Further analysis showed IN DT changing westerlies are , indeed , increasing DT upwelling of carbon - rich deep waters near Antarctica . This effect , though , is being offset further north in DT Southern Ocean by an increased carbon uptake in regions where DT westerlies are blowing less vigorously than in DT past . This MD imply IN EX should be no overall NN in DT absorption of carbon . But Landschützer ’s team found IN DT Southern Ocean ’s ability to absorb carbon is increasing or decreasing over timescales of roughly a decade . DT researchers put these flips down to DT local wind patterns in different parts of DT Southern Ocean known as DT Atlantic , Pacific and Indian sectors . Winds RB seem to VB every decade , as evidenced by about 35 NNS of data , and those local alterations line up well with carbon absorption trends , Landschützer says . All of DT above analysis was based on data collected by ships plying DT Southern Ocean mainly during summer . DT data for DT winter season was spotty ; PRP is hard for ships to venture close to Antarctica at DT NN . So Landschützer ’s team used DT richer summer data and DT sparse winter data to extrapolate and account for DT winter months as best PRP MD . But in recent NNS , researchers have started using floats WDT are offering a JJ , broader glimpse of winter goings - on in DT Southern Ocean . And DT data are disconcerting . Oceanographer Alison Gray of DT University of Washington and her colleagues used data collected by 35 of these autonomous floats , deployed by DT Southern Ocean Carbon and NNP Observations and Modeling ( SOCCOM ) project . DT floats , which had continuously monitored DT top 2,000 meters of DT Southern Ocean waters from NNP 1 , 2014 , to NNP 1 , 2017 , have sensors for a range of ocean surface parameters , and these can be used to calculate DT pCO ₂ of DT surface waters . DT analysis by Gray ’s team showed IN DT Southern Ocean around Antarctica is outgassing significantly more CO₂ in DT winter than Lanschützer ’s methodology estimated . To see if PRP MD resolve DT discrepancy , Landschützer and colleagues combined DT data sets and found IN “ DT truth lies somewhere in DT middle , ” he says : DT carbon uptake is not as low as DT direct float measurements suggest , but neither is PRP as high as estimated by DT ship - only data . While more work will help NN NNS understand exactly what ’s happening in DT Southern Ocean , for DT University of Arizona ’s Russell , DT direct winter data from DT SOCCOM floats is already raising alarms . “ In DT deep winter , when DT winds are howling DT strongest and DT deepest layers are being stirred to DT surface , DT ’s when PRP 're tapping those older carbon waters , ” she says . “ And DT 's what 's worrisome . ” DT deep waters are carbon - rich because of DT microscopic marine algae called phytoplankton WDT live in DT surface waters . DT phytoplankton photosynthesize DT CO₂ in DT NN into organic molecules to build their bodies . When PRP die , PRP sink to DT ocean floor , sequestering DT carbon for centuries . Some phytoplankton are consumed by larger organisms called zooplankton , which in turn are eaten by even bigger creatures whose carbon - rich fecal pellets and dead bodies can RB end up on DT ocean floor , burying ever more carbon in DT deep waters . DT evidence from DT SOCCOM floats suggests IN PRP ’s these deep waters WDT are upwelling during DT Antarctic winters . “ PRP 's DT old rotted NN WDT normally takes hundreds of NNS to circulate out of DT deep , ” Russell says . NNS surmise IN intensifying westerlies are bringing more of this carbon - rich deep NN to DT surface — but PRP need more evidence . CD way to confirm IN speedier westerlies have an impact on Southern Ocean outgassing , and thus on DT levels of atmospheric CO₂ , is to look at past NN evidence . Krystyna Saunders and her colleagues decided to look for some of DT evidence on subantarctic Macquarie Island , which lies about 1,500 kilometers from Tasmania , midway between Australia and Antarctica . At latitude degrees 54S , PRP ’s right in DT main band of DT westerlies . Getting to Macquarie Island is no small feat , even on DT Aurora Australis , a 311 - foot - long icebreaker . Despite its size , DT ship can be tossed around by massive swells , DT kind Shackleton wrote about . “ PRP can be lying down in your bunk , rolling from side to side and head to toe as DT ship swirls around , ” Saunders says . “ If PRP VBP seasick IN me , PRP ’s quite horrible . ” On Macquarie Island , Saunders and her colleagues capitalized on a fortuitous natural record WDT provides clues to how strongly DT winds around DT island have blown in DT past . DT record lies at DT bottom of Emerald Lake , a body of freshwater on DT island ’s western edge . PRP ’s exposed to DT westerlies and thus to salty ocean spray blown in by DT winds : DT greater DT wind speeds , DT higher DT salinity of DT lake . DT salinity in turn affects which species of diatoms , types of algae , can thrive in DT lake . When PRP die , diatoms sink to DT bottom of DT lake and are buried in sediments on DT lakebed , creating a layered chronicle of DT salinity of DT lake — and by proxy DT speed of DT winds . Saunders ’ team extracted sediment cores from DT lakebed , focusing on layers WDT had accumulated during DT Holocene , DT present epoch in NNP ’s history WDT began about 11,700 NNS ago at DT end of DT last NN age . Having inferred DT speeds of westerlies over DT course of DT Holocene , PRP then looked at data from NN cores drilled in Antarctica to VB a direct measure of DT amount of CO₂ in DT atmosphere over DT same NN period . PRP found a clear correlation . “ If PRP look at periods when DT winds were above their average strengths , and periods when carbon dioxide was above its average concentration , PRP overlap , ” Saunders says . This has implications for our understanding of DT effect DT westerlies have on DT Southern Ocean ’s capacity to absorb carbon . Saunders ’ NN supports DT idea IN as DT westerlies speed up , DT Southern Ocean will outgas more CO₂ — as shown by Gray ’s report on wintertime data collected by DT SOCCOM floats — and goes against DT analysis of 35 NNS of ship - based data by Landschützer ’s team . Only more studies , along DT lines of Landschützer ’s attempt to reconcile DT various datasets , will help resolve this debate . EX ’s CD more factor WDT MD feed into DT vicious cycle WDT NNS fear MD already be underway in DT Southern Ocean . Changes in DT extensive Atlantic Ocean circulation system WDT includes DT Gulf Stream MD RB be exacerbating DT NN of DT Southern Ocean , which in turn MD be adding to DT poleward shift and intensification of DT westerlies . This circulation system , called DT Atlantic meridional overturning circulation , or AMOC , brings warm , salty surface NN to DT north , where PRP cools and sinks and then heads back to DT Southern Hemisphere through deeper ocean layers . NNS have found evidence IN DT AMOC has been slowing down , particularly in DT last 150 NNS compared to DT preceding 1,500 NNS . CD indication of this is IN particles being deposited on DT ocean floor have been getting smaller and smaller : Fast - flowing NN can whisk away smaller particles , allowing only DT larger particles to settle , whereas slower NN allows smaller and smaller particles to drop to DT floor . Some of DT AMOC ’s slowdown can be attributed to CD of DT consequences of JJ NN : an increasing supply of glacial meltwater into DT North Atlantic . This fresh NN reduces DT salinity , and hence DT density , of DT surface waters . DT formation of dense , salty , cold NN is essential for PRP to sink down to DT deep ocean in DT North , from where PRP makes its return to DT Southern Hemisphere . This process is being disrupted by NN NN . Since 2004 , a project called RAPID has deployed moorings across DT breadth and depth of DT Atlantic at latitude degrees 26N ( stretching from Florida to Morocco ) , to directly measure changes in DT velocity of DT AMOC . DT measurements show IN DT current is indeed slowing down . But because of inherent decade - to - decade variations in DT NN system , 15 NNS ’ worth of direct measurements is n’t enough to establish a trend . So Levke Caesar , then with DT Potsdam Institute for NNP Impact Research in Germany , and her colleagues extended this record back in NN by using actual measurements of NN surface temperatures from 1870 to 2016 , combined with a high - resolution NN model to reconstruct DT strength of DT AMOC over DT past 150 NNS or so . Their work shows IN DT circulation system ’s strength declined to a minimum around 1990 , then grew until DT early 2000s , and then started declining again . Other NNS have found similar results . As long as greenhouse gas NNS continue to rise , “ all NN models predict a slowdown of DT AMOC , ” Caesar says . Because DT AMOC transports heat from DT south to DT north , a slowdown effectively cools DT Northern Hemisphere and heats up DT Southern Hemisphere . This NN RB intensifies DT westerlies and shifts them toward DT South Pole , leading to a greater vertical churning of DT Southern Ocean , which MD contribute to JJ NN by weakening DT ocean ’s ability to absorb CO₂ . Since DT likely result is even more glacial meltwater flowing into DT North Atlantic , this MD further weaken DT AMOC . PRP has all DT makings of a system WDT ’s slipping out of control . A similar runaway process is thought to have ended DT last NN age , raising CO₂ levels from about 180 to 240 parts per million . This rise happened from about 17,500 NNS ago to 11,700 NNS ago , causing DT deglaciation WDT made NNP more habitable . Atmospheric CO ₂ levels are now past a whopping 410 ppm due to human activity , and rising . In a mere 250 NNS , PRP have increased CO ₂ levels by more than DT amount WDT melted an icy NN over thousands of NNS . DT winds are howling again over DT Southern Ocean and are dangerously close to awakening a beast WDT , until now , has been helping PRP by absorbing copious amounts of carbon . But even DT Southern Ocean is unlikely to cooperate forever . Editor 's note : An earlier version of DT map showing how DT westerlies are made had incorrect placement of NNP ’s geography .

In DT northern hemisphere , DT period between 1983 and 2012 was DT warmest 30 - NN period of DT last 1,400 NNS . DT degree to which DT NN warms in DT future will depend on natural NN variability and DT level of greenhouse gas NNS . If greenhouse gas NNS continue then average JJ temperatures will rise . However , some regions such as DT Arctic will warm faster than others . Over DT past 50 to 100 NNS , photographic evidence has shown IN DT NN 's glaciers have been melting , which has caused them to retreat . DT increase in JJ temperatures is causing glaciers to disappear and is increasing DT melting of NN NN in DT Arctic . NNS often use NN cores to detect changes in temperatures . When snow falls PRP traps air into DT NN . When NNS take a sample of NN PRP reveals DT atmospheric gas concentrations at DT NN DT snow fell . This is used to calculate temperature at DT NN . DT NN can reveal DT temperature of each NN for DT past 400,000 NNS . NNS WDT VBP DT NN cores say EX is clear evidence IN EX has been a rapid increase in temperature in DT past decades . In recent NNS EX have been signs of a seasonal shift - spring arrives earlier and winters tend to be less severe . These seasonal changes affect DT nesting and migration patterns of wildlife . Between 1901 and 2010 , average JJ NN level rose by 0.19 m ."

Delaying NN any further will make PRP impossible to reach desired temperature goals . DT NN for "" rapid and transformational "" NN to limit JJ NN is now , DT report says . Current measures will not keep JJ temperature increases within DT 1.5 - to - 2 - degree Celsius range ( a "" safe "" level to which temperatures can rise and not cause devastation , though 1.5 degrees is preferable ) , according to DT report issued Tuesday . At DT current rate , temperatures are expected to rise 3.2 degrees Celsius ( 5.8 degrees Fahrenheit ) by 2100 , DT UNEP report VBZ . DT changes DT UNEP suggests are extreme : To VB NNP back on track to DT 1.5 - degree goal , NNS must multiply their commitment level , or DT level at which PRP pledge to reduce their NNS , five times DT current rates outlined in DT Paris accords . DT means JJ greenhouse gas NNS must fall at least 7.6 % every NN to remove 32 gigatons of carbon dioxide from DT atmosphere . Incremental NN is no longer enough to stall off DT potentially devastating effects of a changing NN , DT report 's authors write . What DT NN needs now , PRP say , is "" rapid and transformational action . "" G20 NNS account for 78 % of JJ greenhouse gas NNS , but only five of 20 member NNS have set a date to reach net - zero NNS by . Of those , only two have created legislation to enforce those goals . DT NNP leads G20 NNS in per-capita NNS , excluding greenhouse gases from land use , at just above 20 tons of carbon dioxide per capita in 2018 . And 2020 is a critical NN for NN NN : NNS will renegotiate their commitments at DT UN NN NN conference in Glasgow , but PRP 'll have to take extensive action to avert a future crisis , VBD Anne Olhoff , DT head of strategy in DT UNEP 's NN planning and policy division . "" PRP need to be significantly strengthened if PRP are to bridge or narrow DT gap , "" she told CNN . Some progress has been made in DT NNS since DT Paris Agreement : Six G20 member NNS are projected to meet DT commitments PRP made -- which means PRP have room to raise DT ceiling for carbon removal even higher . But drivers IN JJ growth , which is substantially higher than what was initially expected when DT Paris Agreement was created , and population growth have "" more than outweighed good progress made on NN action , "" she VBD . DT report outlines some essential changes to chip away at NNS , including decarbonizing transport . Few NNS have sufficient policies and actions in place to achieve this measure , Olhoff VBD , but establishing vehicle emission standards and investing in JJ transportation WDT runs on electricity are possible , if expensive , steps toward PRP . Pricing carbon -- making major polluters pay for their NNS -- provides an incentive for major emitters to reduce their output . PRP 's often calculated from DT price PRP extract from DT NN in terms of environmental damage or NN care costs , though DT NNS WDT have already implemented this measure MD need to hike up DT cost , per DT report . Another measure , phasing out coal power plants , is more realistic now , Olhoff VBD . Renewable NN technology is increasingly affordable , with utility - scale solar power and wind turbines within competitive price of DT operating costs of existing coal plants . "" EX 's really no big argument for not VBG full - force at renewable NN , "" she VBD . Environmental recalibration will require fundamental structural changes across most of DT NN , DT report acknowledges . PRP wo n't be cheap . NN policies consistent with DT 1.5 - degree goal MD cost up to $ 3.6 trillion per NN globally , according to DT UNEP . But DT cost likely outweighs DT consequences of inaction . DT adaptations humankind MD need to make to survive in a NN where temperatures have risen more than 1.5 degrees Celsius MD seriously damage DT JJ economy and reduce food security and biodiversity , according to DT report . What 's more , delaying action further MD force JJ powers to remove carbon dioxide from DT atmosphere at a magnitude IN current technology and resources have n't caught up with yet , DT report warns . "" NN protection and adaptation investments will become a precondition for peace and stability , "" DT report 's authors write , and will require "" unprecedented "" efforts to transform nearly every sector of society . EX 's growing demand from DT NN to see those changes implemented , Olhoff VBD . DT difficult part is executing NN in such a way WDT does n't disrupt society completely . PRP 's worked for some : Olhoff offered South Africa as an example , as it's made gradual but important progress in phasing out coal power plants . But in India , where coal leads DT NN market and powers DT economy , a NN WDT drastic MD result in social upheaval . "" If PRP VBP to be serious about limiting JJ NN , PRP need to act now and PRP need to take PRP seriously , "" she VBD ."

Per passenger , a flight from Auckland to Wellington will put a similar amount of carbon dioxide into DT air as driving solo in your car . Catching DT train will cut your carbon NNS seven - fold . When aircraft burn jet fuel , however , PRP RB emit short - lived gases IN nitrogen oxides , which can react with other gases in DT air within a day of being released . When nitrogen oxides are released at altitude PRP can react with oxygen to put more ozone into DT air , but can RB remove methane . Ozone and methane are both greenhouse gases , so this chain of chemical reactions can lead to both heating and cooling effects . Unfortunately DT net result when these processes are added together is to drive more NN . Depending on DT atmospheric conditions , aircraft can RB create contrails : clouds of tiny NN crystals . DT NN is not as clear cut on how contrails influence DT NN , but some studies suggest PRP MD have an effect as significant as DT carbon dioxide released during a flight . EX is RB considerable uncertainty as to whether aircraft exhaust might affect cloud formation itself - this MD be a further significant contribution to NN . Read more : NN explained : why do n't PRP have electric aircraft ? Offsetting , by planting trees or restoring natural wildlands , will take carbon dioxide back out of DT atmosphere . But PRP MD have to do this on a massive scale to feed our appetite for flight . NNS from international air travel are not included in DT Paris Agreement , although DT NNP Nations has been working on DT Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation ( CORSIA ) , which MD begin to deal with these . Initially , DT scheme will be voluntary . Airlines flying routes between NNS WDT join DT scheme will have to offset any NNS above 2020 levels from January 2021 . NNS from flying stand to triple by 2050 if demand for air travel continues to grow . Even if air travel became carbon neutral through DT use of biofuels or electric planes , DT effects from contrails and interactions with clouds mean IN flying MD never be NN neutral . With no easy fixes on DT horizon , JJ NNS are thinking hard about their need to fly . This is why I took a NN off air travel ( alongside my colleague Quentin Atkinson ) in 2018 . I have been back on planes in 2019 , but I have learned how to reduce my flying , by combining trips and making better use of video conferencing . Fly if PRP must , offset if PRP can , but – if PRP are concerned about NN NN – CD of DT best things PRP MD choose to do is to fly less ."

NNS say IN if DT East Antarctic NNP Sheet – which is 60 times DT size of England – melts , NN levels MD rise by four metres , putting areas of DT UK at risk of disappearing entirely . Experts are now warning IN more needs to be done to prevent continued JJ NN . Melting NN can have a devastating effect on DT NN , causing DT NN to heat up more quickly , changing ocean circulation systems WDT regulate JJ weather , and increasing DT risk of flooding and tsunamis damage . A NN into historical NN loss suggests even "" moderate NN "" of NNP MD melt DT East Antarctic NNP Sheet . "" With current JJ temperatures already CD degree higher than during pre-industrial times , future NN loss seems inevitable if PRP fail to reduce carbon NNS , "" VBD Dr David Wilson , of Imperial College London , who worked on DT research . NNS have poured lots of effort into investigating DT West Antarctic NNP Sheet , which mostly sits on land below NN level . Due to its low - lying position , PRP contributes to most of DT continent 's NN melt today . But experts at Imperial College London and DT University of Queensland have now investigated risks facing DT East Antarctic NNP Sheet . DT EAIS is DT largest NN sheet on NNP , and poses a major hazard if PRP disappears . Now a NN in Nature suggests IN 2 °C of NN over "" a couple of millennia "" MD cause significant melting of DT EAIS . "" Antarctica is around twice DT size of Australia , with NN sheets several kilometres thick and containing around half of DT NN 's fresh NN , "" VBD Dr Kevin Welsh , at DT University of Queensland , a co-author on DT NN . "" DT East Antarctic NNP Sheet covers about two thirds of DT area , and because its base is largely above NN level PRP was generally thought to be less sensitive to NN climates than DT adjacent West Antarctic NNP Sheet . "" However , some areas – IN DT Wilkes Land Subglacial Basin , directly south of Australia – are below NN level and contain enough NN to raise JJ NN levels by several metres . "" DT evidence PRP have suggests IN with DT predicted 2 °C NN in Antarctica – if sustained over a couple of millennia – DT sheet MD start melting in these locations . "" Glaciers , which are created by NN sheets , grind up rocks on land . These rocks are then transported into DT nearby Southern Ocean as sediment . This creates a record of earlier erosion by DT NN sheet . Researchers chemically analysed layers of sediment from DT ocean floor , which MD have originated from DT Wilkes Subglacial Basin – collected as part of DT Integrated Ocean Drilling Program . DT NN looked at sediment layers WDT had settled on DT seafloor during DT four warm intervals occurring between NN ages over DT last 450,000 NNS . "" Studying NN sheet behaviour in DT geological past can inform PRP about future changes , "" VBD Dr Wilson . "" By building a picture of how DT NN sheet has grown and shrunk as temperatures have fluctuated , PRP can understand DT response of DT EAIS to future NN . "" DT team found chemical "" fingerprints "" in DT sediment which revealed DT patterns of erosion as DT NN sheet advanced and retreated . PRP turned out IN DT NN sheet had retreated from its current size during some of these warmer "" interglacial "" periods , between 125,000 and 400,000 NNS ago . Importantly , at DT NN , temperatures were as little as two degrees warmer than pre-industrial times – and CD degree warmer than today . During these warmer periods , JJ NN levels were between six and 13 metres higher than PRP are today . According to researchers , if all DT NN in DT Wilkes Subglacial Basin melted in modern times , JJ NN levels MD rise by up to four metres . "" PRP found IN DT most extreme changes in DT NN sheet occurred during two interglacial periods 125,000 and 400,000 NNS ago , when JJ NN levels were several metres higher than PRP are today , "" Dr Walsh explained . "" These periods MD be analogues for future climates and PRP seems likely IN NN loss from DT East Antarctic NNP Sheet contributed to those higher NN levels . "" NN loss contributes to rising JJ NN levels which are a threat to JJ coastal communities , and making projections requires a solid understanding of how sensitive these NN sheets are . "" CD of DT biggest concerns about rising NN levels is DT risk than smaller , more common tsunamis MD have a more damaging effect than PRP do today . Last month , NNS issued a warning about DT risk of “ devastating tsunamis ” caused by NN NN . Research in NNP Advances suggested IN rising NN levels – caused by JJ NN – significantly increase DT threat of giant killer waves . Experts modelled DT impact of tsunamis based on NN level increases , and discovered worrying results . PRP found IN rising NN levels allowed tsunamis to reach much further inland , significantly increasing DT risk of floods . This means small tsunamis WDT might not be deadly today MD wreak havoc in DT future . “ Our research shows IN NN - level rise can significantly increase DT tsunami hazard , which means IN smaller tsunamis in DT future can have DT same adverse impacts as big tsunamis MD today , ” VBD Robert Weiss , a professor of geosciences at Virginia Tech . And if PRP VBP Britain is safe from tsunamis , VB again . Earlier this week , research revealed IN deadly tsunamis crashing into DT UK is more common than previously thought . NNS believe three killer waves have hit DT UK within DT last 10,000 NNS – raising DT possibility IN another NN MD be due . PRP already knew about CD of these : around 8,200 NNS ago , DT Storegga submarine landslide off DT coast of Norway sparked a 20 - metre high tsunami WDT swept across Shetland .

Recent publications have exclusively focused on a few prominent spring leaf unfolding phases and results of those MD be strongly related to DT choice of analysed species , having different sensitivities and covering different seasons . Phenology is controlled by seasonal patterns in DT NN signal ( Lapenis et al. , 2014 ) and these will vary by location ( spatial differences in DT NN signal ) and NN period ( temporal differences in DT NN signal , e.g. Rutishauser et al. , 2009 ) . Consequently , this update is more than timely since DT NN signal has not been stable , but temporal variations or trends in NN NN have been reported , especially related to DT so called hiatus or standstill period ( Zang , Jochner ‐ Oette , Cortés , Rammig , & Menzel , 2019 ) . A publication has already indicated IN EX were no trends in spring and autumn phenology during this NN hiatus period ( Wang et al. , 2019 ) . Another phenological regime shift in DT mid‐1980s was RB related to discontinuous temperature changes ( Reid et al. , 2016 ) . Temperature sensitivity has RB been shown to vary with specific plant traits , such as evolutionary relatedness , and to support invasions and plant performance ( e.g. Wolkovich , Cook , & Davies , 2014 ) . For wheat and maize in agriculture EX are hints of geographic differences among cultivars in sensitivity to vernalization , day length and temperature ( Van Bussel , Stehfest , Siebert , Müller , & Ewert , 2015 ) . However , EX are still major knowledge gaps concerning DT so‐called ‘ false ’ phenological phases , such as sowing or harvesting in agriculture , whose timings are decided by farmers . DT GCB2006 NN and follow ‐up publications provided DT first evidence IN DT phenological signal in agriculture was weaker than DT signal for wild growing plant species ( Bock , Sparks , Estrella , & Menzel , 2013 ; Estrella , Sparks , & Menzel , 2007 ; Menzel , Sparks , Estrella , Koch , et al. , 2006 ; Menzel , Vopelius , Estrella , Schleip , & Dose , 2006 ) . However , PRP can be anticipated IN , sooner or later , agricultural management and / or choice of cultivars will RB be adapted to DT JJ potential growing seasons . DT drivers of autumn phenology , such as leaf colouring and leaf fall , are still far from being completely understood ( Estrella & Menzel , 2006 ; Gallinat , Primack , & Wagner , 2016 ; Gill et al. , 2015 ; Wu et al. , 2018 ) . Major factors WDT MD impact on DT results of this update are different changes in ( apparent ) temperature sensitivity ( e.g . Fu , Piao , et al. , 2015 ; Fu , Zhao , et al. , 2015 ) . Species ‐specific increases in heat requirements related to a decrease in chilling have been especially identified as DT main reason ( Fu , Piao , et al. , 2015 ) . However , EX are RB contrasting opinions for example , by Wang et al. ( 2017 ) . Güsewell , Furrer , Gehrig , and Pietragalla ( 2017 ) showed IN for Switzerland EX are still no indications of a lack of chilling leading to altered temperature sensitivities . Changes in temperature sensitivities are reported as not uniform over NN ( Chen et al. , 2019 ) and , in particular , a weakened temperature response was observed since 2000 ( Fu et al. , 2014 ) . Spatial variations in temperature sensitivity have been linked to mean annual temperature and to seasonal temperature range ( Lapenis , Henry , Vuille , & Mower , 2014 ; Menzel , Sparks , Estrella , & Roy , 2006 ; Wang et al. , 2014 ) . Both major backup systems to prevent a premature spring development ( chilling , photoperiod ) MD finally lead to nonlinear responses of phenological onset dates to forcing temperatures ( Jochner , Sparks , Laube , & Menzel , 2016 ) . Thus , DT well ‐accepted role of phenology as a NN NN indicator is based on DT formal attribution of shifted phenological onset dates to anthropogenic ‐induced NN ( Rosenzweig et al. , 2007 , 2008 ) , demonstrating at DT same NN IN DT phenological trends are not just natural variability , for example , as shown by Guan ( 2014 ) for two phenophases which unequivocally corresponded to DT respective winter / spring NN trends . Most studies , however , rely on proof of DT sensitivity of phenological phases to temperature as DT fundamental prerequisite of NN NN detection and attribution , and have linked phenological changes to temperature increases ( e.g . Cook et al. , 2012 ; Thackeray et al. , 2016 ) . Since EX is thorough evidence IN spring phenological development is RB partially triggered by fulfilment of winter chilling and by photoperiod ( e.g. Laube et al. , 2014 ; Tang et al. , 2016 ; Vitasse & Basler , 2013 ) , PRP is debated whether phenological changes still mirror DT recent ongoing NN , or mirror PRP to DT same extent as before . Therefore , an update of DT assessment of phenological changes across Europe and their attribution to NN NN is necessary . In contrast to DT GCB2006 publication , this update will uniquely concentrate on plant phenology . Although plant phenology is CD of DT oldest forms of environmental monitoring , with phenological observations taken by ancient civilizations ( Koch et al. , 2007 ; Schwartz , 2003 ) , PRP was only in DT 1990s IN its renaissance started with key publications on detection of NN NN impacts on JJ vegetation . Keeling , Chin , and Whorf ( 1996 ) were DT first to report a 7 day earlier start of DT growing season based on long‐term measurements of atmospheric CO 2 concentration , which Myneni , Keeling , Tucker , Asrar , and Nemani ( 1997 ) confirmed using normalized difference vegetation index satellite data from DT Northern Hemisphere . Menzel and Fabian ( 1999 ) then provided DT necessary ground truth by their analyses of long‐term European phenological data . JJ other papers , summarized in well ‐cited reviews and relevant chapters in IPCC reports ( e.g. Rosenzweig et al. , 2007 ; Walther et al. , 2002 ) , confirmed DT extraordinary role of phenology as a bio‐indicator of NN NN . While research initially focused purely on DT identification of changes , PRP then extended to communication of NN NN to DT general NN ( e.g. Van Vliet et al. , 2003 ) as well as on various ecological consequences of these changes ( Morisette et al. , 2009 ; Thackeray et al. , 2010 ) . Nevertheless , at DT beginning of this renewed research EX was a latent accusation of a publication bias , or cherry picking , in DT sense IN only DT most advancing records or extraordinary changes found their way into popular scientific journals . Therefore , DT COST725 initiative collected all available European phenological data ( later developed as DT PEP725 database , Templ et al. , 2018 ) and analysed more than 100,000 NN series for NN NN ‐driven changes ( Menzel , Sparks , Estrella , Koch , et al. , 2006 , hereafter referred as GCB2006 ) . DT GCB2006 NN concluded IN EX was indeed a strong response in European phenology to NN NN and IN these changes matched DT NN pattern . With more than 1,500 citations in DT Web of NNP Core Collection , this NN has a high relevance for DT scientific discourse on NN NN impacts on DT biosphere . PRP was RB DT backbone of DT corresponding assessment of observed changes and responses in natural and managed systems of AR4 WGII of DT IPCC ( Rosenzweig et al. , 2007 ) as well as of DT subsequent paper of attribution of JJ impacts in nature to anthropogenic NN ( Rosenzweig et al. , 2008 ) . Second , PRP applied a spatial approach based on all sites for which PRP tested DT effect of DT corresponding temperature trends on all phenological trends . For this PRP divided all ( significant as well as non‐significant ) temperature trends in terciles ( below , average , above ) on a seasonal basis and DT phenological trends by sign and significance ( negative significant , negative nonsignificant , positive nonsignificant , positive significant ) . A frequency analysis was performed on this cross tabulation using Chi‐square tests and p ‐values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using DT FDR . Pearson ( standardized ) residuals for each cell were determined to assess their relative contribution to DT total Chi‐square score . Attribution followed DT methods proposed by Rosenzweig et al. ( 2007 , 2008 ) . First , based on statistically significant trends only , DT percentage of significant trends ( out of all significant trends ) matching DT direction expected from NN NN was determined , both for DT phenological groups of GCB2006 and of Update . According to IPCC likelihood terminology , > 66 % probability corresponds to ‘ likely ’ , > 90 % to ‘ very likely ’ , and > 95 % to ‘ extremely likely ’ . In DT results section , DT model coefficients are visualized using so ‐called effect plots , which plot DT predicted effect of each explanatory variable on DT outcome . This makes comparisons easier with respect to DT different units and range of DT explanatory variables , and allows DT identification of interaction terms and smooth terms . DT effect of each variable is calculated by holding all other variables constant ( except for interactions ) . DT models were fitted in R statistical software version 3.6 using DT mgcv‐package ( Wood , 2017 ) , effects were calculated using DT emmeans ‐package ( Lenth , 2019 ) , and results were visualized using DT ggplot2 ‐ package ( Wickham , 2016 ) . In order to understand what DT partial contribution of explanatory factors to DT observed phenological trend was , PRP followed a modelling approach . Explanatory factors / variables were DT nine clusters ( cluster9 , see Table 2 ) , topography ( longitude , latitude and elevation ) , traits ( woodiness , pollination mode ) , start NN of records and number of recorded NNS . A symbolic description of DT generalized additive model ( composed of linear , nonlinear / smooth and factorial terms ) iswhere cluster9 , woodiness and pollination mode are factorial variables ( encoded as dummies in DT model ) with levels indicated as above ( cluster9 ) , woody or nonwoody ( woodiness ) , wind or insect ( pollination mode ) ; all other variables are numeric ; start NN and number NNS were included as smooth functions ( denoted with prefix s ; using penalized splines ) ; all other numeric variables were included with linear coefficients ; interaction terms are denoted by *. Furthermore , DT overall mean onset dates ( DOY mean ) and mean temperature ( T mean ) over DT whole NN period ( 1951 –2018 ) for each phenological series ( per species / phase / station ) were calculated and aggregated in weeks to VB DT phenological anomalies from DT average . Every 10 NN NN block ( 1950s , 1960s and so on ) was selected and DT corresponding DOY mean and T mean were again calculated for DT corresponding weeks of DT NN . DT deviations of DOY mean and T mean from DT overall mean were considered as DT phenological anomalies and 95 % confidence intervals for each week in each NN block were calculated . For each decade PRP used loess smoothing of DT temperature anomalies and inverted DT y ‐axis for better visual comparison with DT phenological anomalies . Phenological changes were determined as linear regressions of onset days ( DOY ) against NN for all series ( i.e. 30 + NNS in Update ) . For GCB2006s ( 1971 –2000 ) , similar to GCB2006 , all 15 + NN series were considered . p values of DT linear regression slopes were adjusted for multiple comparisons using DT false ‐discovery‐rate ( FDR ; Benjamini & Hochberg , 1995 ) . Proportions of ( significant ) negative / ( significant ) positive trends and mean slopes ( Tr mean ) were determined for DT different categories described in Table 2 . DT uncertainty range of Tr mean is DT 95 % confidence interval for estimating DT mean ( of DT slopes ) , and not DT 95 % interval of DT underlying data . Thus , DT range is equivalent to DT 95 % CI of a CD ‐sample t test . Trends were RB determined for moving 30 NN blocks over DT whole NN period where 15 + NNS of valid data existed . DT mean slope per category and 30 NN block was then calculated to assess DT varying trend strength over NN . Daily mean temperature ( T mean ) was extracted and processed into annual and seasonal averages ( DJF winter , MAM spring , JJA summer , SON autumn ) in order to calculate DT respective linear annual and seasonal temperature trends over DT entire 1951 – 2018 NN period for Update based on DT geographical coordinates of each phenological station . DT E‐OBS v19.0HOM gridded data set with a 0.25 degree regular grid ( Cornes , Schrier , Besselaar , & Jones , 2018 ) , which is DT homogenized version of E‐OBS v19.0e and thus more suitable to derive long‐term trends , was used for extracting DT daily mean temperature for all stations during 1951 – 2018 . PRP was additionally adjusted for station ‐specific elevation by using DT elevation difference between DT station and DT average of DT climatic grid cell derived from DT JJ raster Digital Elevation Model , DT JJ 30 Arc‐Second Elevation Data Set ( GTOPO30 ) together with E‐OBS v19.0HOM , based on a temperature lapse rate of 6.4°C / km ( see RB Ma et al. , 2019 ; Olsson & Jönsson , 2014 ) . In DT previous GCB2006 NN comprising ~ 100,000 series in DT period 1971 –2000 plant phenological series were categorized into four groups ( see Table 2 ) . For Update and GCB2006s , PRP further refined this categorization into nine clusters , taking into account BBCH coding of phases ( Meier , 1997 ) as well as farming activities , and additionally defined four periods / seasons , different from those in GCB2006 . PRP is important to notice IN a direct comparison between GCB2006 and DT updated results is not straightforward since some differences in phenophases and data selection procedure exist . Thus a GCB2006s ( s = simulated ) data set was defined as a subset of Update containing identical species / phases / stations , but restricted to DT GCB2006 period and series length ( 1971 –2000 , 15 + NNS ) . This simulation of GCB2006 conditions in Update allowed studying DT effects of ongoing NN NN post ‐2000 as well as methodological aspects ( 15 + vs. 30 + NN series ) , when comparing Update and GCB2006s results . In contrast , GCB2006 results are only reported and discussed with respect to possible effects due to some different sites / phenophases in GCB2006s . For data correction ( following e.g . Chen et al. , 2018 , 2019 ; Ma , Huang , Hänninen , & Berninger , 2019 ; Vitasse , Signarbieux , & Fu , 2018 ) , PRP filtered out in each series those observations outside DT range median ± 3.5 × MAD ( median absolute deviation ) , which is definitely a more than conservative approach ( see Leys , Ley , Klein , Bernard , & Licata , 2013 ; Miller , 1991 ) , since only DT extreme values considered absolutely wrong were excluded ( in our case less than 0.7 % of DT data ) . Out of DT complete phenological data from these NNS , PRP took observational data between 1951 and 2018 with NN series ( series per species / phase / station ) longer than 29 NNS and ending in or after 2000 . Duplicates were removed by averaging DT respective DOYs ( onset dates as day of DT NN ) in DT same NN . Very early phenological events ( e.g. hazel or snowdrop flowering in December ) were allocated to DT correct reference NN by negative DOYs . Unfortunately , PRP was not possible to directly update DT GCB2006 data set due to a lack of access to DT recent phenological data of specific NNS . However , data from Germany , Austria and Switzerland constituted around 96.7 % of DT GCB2006 data set . Thus , PRP is justified to consider DT JJ data set as comparable . Complete original plant phenological observation data were retrieved individually from DT European Meteorological Services of Germany ( DWD ) , Austria ( ZAMG ) and Switzerland ( MeteoSwiss ) . Data of these NNS account for 96.3 % of DT PEP database ( Templ et al. , 2018 ) , thus our results are comparable to any other based on PEP725 data . However , these national phenological databases are richer in sites , species and phenophases ; therefore , although having a smaller spatial extent , are preferred for this NN ( see map in Figure S1 a ) . Attribution of phenological trends for DT nine clusters ( see Table 2 ) to trends in seasonal temperatures by Chi‐squared test ( absolute numbers are given in Figure S4 ) . Pearson residuals indicate DT relative contribution of a cell to DT total Chi‐square . Crossed out combinations were not significant ( ‐values adjusted for multiple comparisons of 4 * 9 = 36 tests by FDR ) . DT size of DT circle is proportional to DT amount of DT contribution , green indicates positive residuals , which specify a positive association between phenological and temperature trends , and light grey implies a repulsion or negative association [ Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com Concerning DT spatial match of temperature trends to all phenological trends , results of DT Chi‐square tests indicated IN for all phenological clusters , except crop vegetative development in spring ( Cv sp ) as well as ripening phases of fruit trees and wild plant species in summer ( FWg su ) , EX was at least CD significant association of phenological trends with seasonal NN patterns in winter / spring / summer ( Figure 5 ; Figure S4 ) . Crop generative development in spring ( Cg sp ) was significantly associated with winter and spring NN patterns , and DT respective spring phases in fruit trees and wild plant species ( FWv sp , FWg sp ) even displayed a stronger positive association ( see Figure S4 ) . For DT latter two , counterintuitively average and above average summer temperature trends were associated with delayed ( subsequent ) spring phenophases . Above average NN in winter and spring was significantly associated with delayed leaf colouring and leaf fall ( FWv au ) . For farmers ’ activities , DT Chi‐square tests indicated IN advancing spring activities ( F sp ) were significantly linked with above average NN in winter , but below average NN in summer . For farmers ’ summer activities , above average NN in summer and autumn was associated with advancing summer trends ( F su ) . In contrast , below average NN in summer was connected to advancing autumn activities ( F au ) . About 96 % and 95 % of DT significant changes of leaf unfolding and flowering ( b1 ) and fruit ripening ( b2 ) , respectively , were negative , thus indicating advancing onset dates with NN ( see Table 3 ) . For farmers ’ activities , 83 % of DT significant trends were negative . Significant leaf colouring and leaf fall trends ( b3 in Table 3 , FWv au in Table S1 a ) were 63 % positive , hinting to delayed autumn with NN . This pattern is confirmed by DT corresponding analysis for DT spring and summer clusters ( data from Table S1 a ) : 95 % , 98 % , 98 % , 98 % , 92 % and 91 % of their significant trends ( Cv sp , Cg sp , FWv sp , FWg sp , FWg su , F su ) were negative and matched DT NN signal . Only 89 % and 78 % of DT significant trends of farming activities in spring and autumn were advancing . Thus , advancing farming activities are likely , phenological phases in summer are very likely and phenological phases in spring , such as leaf unfolding and flowering , are even extremely likely to be attributable to increasing temperatures . Effect plots of DT generalized additive model showing DT predicted effect of each explanatory variable on DT slope of phenological trends in Update . ( a ) Factorial variables of nine clusters and of selected plant species traits with 95 % confidence intervals , ( b ) start NN and number of NNS as smooth functions with penalized splines with 95 % confidence intervals , ( c ) topographical variables interacting with phenological clusters Since phenological trends varied with phenological group ( Table 3 ) and cluster ( Figure 1 ) , NN ( Figure 2 ) , season ( Figure 3 ) and length of DT series ( Table 3 ) , these variables , as well as geographical coordinates and species traits , were used in DT generalized additive model . DT following reported values are model estimates , and their uncertainty relates to DT uncertainty in estimating DT model ( i.e. confidence intervals do not cover DT variability of DT data , but DT uncertainty in estimating DT mean values ) . DT results ( Figure 4 ) indicate IN all phenological clusters except leaf colouring and leaf fall ( FWv au ) exhibited negative trends of on average − 0.224 days / NN . Only farmers ’ activities had smaller negative trends : in spring − 0.126 days / NN ( 95 % CI : − 0.136 , − 0.116 ) and autumn − 0.128 days / NN ( −0.138 , − 0.118 ) . Flowering of fruit trees and wild plant species in spring , FWg sp , − 0.277 days / NN ( −0.284 , − 0.270 ) , and vegetative development of agricultural crops in spring , Cv sp , − 0.317 days / NN ( −0.328 , − 0.306 ) , had stronger trends . For species traits , DT models showed IN nonwoody insect ‐pollinated species had smaller trends with − 0.150 days / NN ( −0.159 , − 0.142 ) than DT other three combinations ( on average − 0.210 days / NN ) . EX was no obvious effect of DT length of DT phenological series on trends . However , DT start of DT series mattered : Series starting at DT end of DT 1970s were linked to DT strongest advancing trends , while earlier and later starting series were associated to less strong advancing trends . For JJ clusters EX was a mixed effect of longitude on trends , and clear negative effects of latitude and elevation ; however , DT largest impacts were seen for elevation . DT average effect on phenological trends of latitude was − 0.010 days / NN per degree latitude and for elevation − 0.140 days / NN per km elevation , thus higher elevations were consistently associated with stronger advancing trends . This reverse order was equally apparent in mean weekly temperature anomalies ( Figure S3 b ) where DT 1991 –2000 decade exhibited DT warmest weekly temperatures and DT 2011 –2018 decade DT coldest ones , but from week 4 to 8 , thus 6 weeks prior to DT leafing / flowering phenological response . In general anomalies in T mean varied more strongly from week to week mirroring DT more fluctuating weather / temperature ( Figure S3 b ) . For leaf colouring and fall ( FWv au ) DT 1951 – 1960 decade had DT earliest onset dates , thus , PRP is likely IN DT inclusion of this decade in Update ( 1951 –2018 ) triggered DT now delaying autumn trends . Farmers ’ activities in spring and summer ( F sp , F su ) only exhibited earlier than average starting dates in DT last and DT two last decades respectively . Mean decadal phenological anomalies across weeks of DT NN ( Figures S2 and S3 a ) allow deeper insights into DT trend structure . DT spring and summer clusters ( uppermost five panels in Figure S3 a ) provide a text book example of NN NN ‐driven changes in phenology : In DT last four decades DT weekly mean anomalies gradually decreased , whereas respective decadal anomalies of weekly mean temperatures increased . Interestingly , during week 10 – 13 DT anomalies of leaf unfolding and flowering of fruit trees and wild plant species in spring ( FWv sp , FWg sp ) displayed a reverse order of DT last three decades : 1991 –2000 had DT earliest mean onset dates , 2011 –2018 DT least early ones . Respective spring phases for crops ( Cv sp , Cg sp ) advanced more strongly than for fruit trees and wild plant species before week 20 and less strongly afterwards . In summer , from week 28 onwards , fruit ripening in fruit trees and wild plant species ( FWg su ) , as well as ripening of crops and harvest dates in agriculture ( F su ) , exhibited similar advancing trends . However , before DT , in early summer ( week 22 to 28 ) , farmers ’ activities were more strongly advancing than contemporaneous ripening phases in FWg su . Farmers ’ activities in early autumn from mid‐August to end of September were almost unchanged , whereas in October a clear advancing response to NN was visible . Mean slopes of linear trends per week of DT NN ( W4–W47 ) calculated for all series in Update . Phenophase groups according to ( a ) GCB2006 , and ( b ) nine clusters . Mean values indicated by solid black circles , vertical division at 90 day intervals . Shading indicates 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) . CIs exceeding DT ‐axis range are not shown by default [ Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com Plotting mean trends over weeks of DT NN ( Figure 3 ) clearly exhibits systematic variations with season . Only weeks covered by less data points at DT beginning or end of record had wider confidence intervals of DT mean trends . In autumn , trends of delayed leaf colouring and leaf fall ( b3 in Figure 3 a , FWv au in Figure 3 b ) increased from week 36 to 47 , suggesting IN sites or species with later senescence were delayed more . During DT first 3 months of DT NN ( week 4 – 12 ) , advance in flowering of first fruit trees and wild plant species ( FWg sp in Figure 3 b ) decreased distinctly , indicating IN strongest advances in spring phenology were observed for early flowering species and / or very warm sites . DT more detailed clusters show IN DT advance of leaf unfolding of fruit trees and wild plant species ( FWv sp in Figure 3 b ) was stable across DT weeks 11 – 23 , matching those of FWg sp . Consequently , when adjusted for identical weeks in spring , EX were no differences in trends between generative and vegetative phases . Quite clearly , these changes in DT intensity of phenological changes overtime were related to temperature changes . Slopes of mean annual temperature NN increased in NN till 1978 – 2007 ( +0.0582 ± 0.0004 °C / NN ) , and for DT last block ( 1989 –2018 ) PRP only reached +0.0344 ± 0.0004 °C / NN ( Figure 2 d ) . This picture was RB true for all single seasons except autumn . DT recorded changes of DT four periods ( GS , FWgP , FS , CgP ) differed substantially ( Figure 2 c ) . DT growing season ( GS ) was clearly prolonged for all 30 NN periods ending after 1989 , exhibiting a maximum slope of +0.428 ± 0.016 days / NN for DT period 1976 –2005 and a considerably smaller CD of +0.215 ± 0.017 days / NN for DT final 30 NN block . DT generative period of fruit trees and wild plant species ( FWgP ) showed almost no changes in any direction , thus was stable across DT NN period . DT FS , defined as DT period between first and last farmers ’ activities , and DT crop generative period ( CgP ) were predominantly shortened for DT 30 NN periods ending after 1989 , both reaching mean slopes of − 0.449 ± 0.048 and − 0.143 ± 0.038 days / NN , respectively , in DT final 30 NN period . Mean slopes of linear trends ( Tr ) calculated for all 15 + NN phenological series in respective 30 NN moving window blocks within 1951 – 2018 for DT Update data set . Shading indicates 95 % confidence intervals in all subplots . Phenophase groups according to ( a ) GCB2006 , ( b ) nine clusters , and ( c ) four periods as defined in Table 2 , ( d ) mean slopes of annual and seasonal mean temperature trends with inverted ‐axis for all sites and NN blocks [ Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com DT approach of calculating trends over moving 30 NN windows across DT whole NN period 1951 – 2018 clearly indicated NN ‐varying changes in onset dates ( Figure 2 ) . Until DT end NN of 1988 slopes were stable and positive for most phenogroups ( Figure 2 a ) and clusters ( Figure 2 b ) indicating delayed onsets . Advancing onsets were only determined for some phenophases related to agriculture ( Cv sp , F sp , F au , i.e. development of crops in spring , sowing of spring crops and winter cereals ) . After DT end NN of 1989 , slopes for leaf colouring and leaf fall ( b3 in Figure 2 a , FWv au in Figure 2 b ) oscillated around zero , whereas for all other groups / clusters DT trends were becoming more and more negative . DT minimum slopes ( i.e. strongest advancing trends ) were reached around 1979 –2008 and DT most pronounced advancing mean trend of − 0.553 ± 0.004 days / NN was recorded for flowering phases of fruit trees and wild plant species in spring ( FWg sp ) . Afterwards , trends became weaker again , especially for spring leaf unfolding and flowering of fruit trees and wild plant species ( FWv sp , FWg sp ) . Finally , for DT most recent 30 NN period ( 1989 –2018 ) PRP were all less than half of their maximum in DT 1980s to 2010s although still negative ( Cv sp −0.214 ± 0.018 , Cg sp −0.237 ± 0.010 , FWv sp −0.098 ± 0.007 , FWg sp −0.080 ± 0.005 , FWg su − 0.232 ± 0.010 , F su − 0.179 ± 0.009 , F au − 0.075 ± 0.012 days / NN ) except for F sp ( +0.018 ± 0.013 days / NN ) . About 84 % of DT series indicated a lengthening of DT growing season ( GS , from leaf unfolding to colouring ) and 48 % were significantly longer ( Figure 1 b ) . DT mean trend was +0.261 ± 0.008 days / NN . DT farming season ( FS , period of farmers ’ activities from spring to autumn ) shortened by − 0.149 ± 0.022 days / NN with two ‐thirds of DT trends being negative . Although DT generative period for agricultural crops ( CgP , from flowering to ripeness ) was definitively shortened ( −0.205 ± 0.019 days / NN , 78 % negative ) , EX was no clear NN pattern for fruit trees and wild plants ( FWgP , from flowering to ripeness ; see Table S1 b ) . DT average trend was almost zero with roughly equal numbers of DT series showing a shortening or lengthening of DT generative period . Undoubtedly ~ 3/4 of DT farmers ’ spring and summer activities ( F sp sowing of spring cereals , F su harvest ) were advancing ( 74 % and 84 % , respectively ) and DT percentages of significant advances clearly increased from GCB2006s to Update ( 14% –31 % and 24%–53 % , respectively ) . For farmers ’ sowing of autumn crops ( F au ) , more advanced than delayed series were observed ; however , DT picture was still similar to GCB2006s except IN more trends ( both advances and delays ) were significant ( Figure 1 a ; Table S1 a ) . Surprisingly , mean slopes became less negative , except for F sp which advanced more strongly in Update than in GCB2006s ( −0.116 ± 0.005 vs. − 0.075 ± 0.011 days / NN ) .

Except for FWv au which comprises leaf colouring and fall in fruit trees and wild species in autumn , DT overall NN pattern in all other clusters was advancing . All spring and summer clusters had higher percentages of negative and significant negative trends in Update than in GCB2006s ( Figure 1 a ) , for example , ~ 90 % of DT four NN ‐driven spring categories ( Cv sp , Cg sp , FWv sp , FWg sp ) advanced ( 86 % , 90 % , 92 % and 91 % , respectively ) , up to 60 % significantly . Interestingly , for ripening in fruit trees and wild species in summer ( FWg su ) , DT percentage was slightly smaller with 81 % ( 46 % significantly ) advanced , although this pattern RB intensified from GCB2006s to Update . In contrast , DT mean slopes of DT spring and summer phenological groups ( Cv sp , Cg sp , FWv sp , FWg sp and FWg su ) very clearly indicated throughout smaller advances in Update than in GCB2006s . This decrease in trend strength was RB quite large , for example , − 0.428 ± 0.004 days / NN for FWg sp in GCB2006s compared to only − 0.254 ± 0.002 days / NN in Update ( Figure 1 c ; Table S1 a ) . For leaf unfolding and flowering , fruiting and farmers ’ activities , DT percentage of negative trends slightly increased , for example from 87 % ( GCB2006s ) to 89 % advanced for leaf unfolding and flowering ( Table 3 ) . DT percentage of expected , delayed trends for leaf colouring increased from 49 % ( GCB2006s ) to 57 % . Longer ( 30 + NNS ) series led to considerably higher proportions of significantly advancing trends ( e.g. 54 % of leaf unfolding and flowering series compared to 30 % in GCB2006s ) . While GCB2006 as well as GCB2006s indicated a less clear pattern for both farmers ’ activities and leaf colouring , DT direction of changes was more obvious in Update with farmers ’ activities being mostly advanced ( 72 % ) and leaf colouring predominantly delayed ( 57 % ) . Though DT phenological NN signal in terms of DT proportion of significant trends increased , DT mean advance in days per NN was considerably weaker than in GCB2006s . For example , DT mean slope for leaf unfolding and flowering was – 0.394 ± 0.003 days / NN ( 95 % confidence intervals ) in GCB2006s and only − 0.240 ± 0.002 days / NN in Update . DT update of DT GCB2006 NN almost two decades later has clearly revealed IN EX is still a significant NN NN pattern in European plant phenology . Since a direct comparison of DT almost 97,000 Update series to DT GCB2006 ones was not possible , PRP simulated GCB2006s results based on Update to VB DT effects of ongoing NN NN after 2000 as well as of longer series ( 15 + vs. 30 + NNS ) . Differences in DT trend structure of GCB2006 and GCB2006s suggested IN any results of trends analyses MD RB partly be driven by DT set of species and phenophases included . In our case a considerable adjustment in DT observational programme of DT DWD in 1991 has led to a substantial reduction in DT number of ( agricultural ) species / phases when series were selected to end in 2000 or later . ZAMG data selection mirrors a similar decrease of observations in DT last two decades ( see Figure S1 b ) . In DT following DT results will be discussed with respect to DT three guiding research questions . EX is still a clear picture of phenological advance except for autumn . For DT vegetative and generative phases of crops , fruit trees and wild plants , longer NN series ( 30 + NNS in Update ) led to ≥90 % advancing trends in spring ( Cg , FWv , FWg ) , ≥ 81 % for Cv and FWg , and ~ 75 % for DT farmers ’ activities in these seasons ( F , F ) . Accordingly , at least 30 + NN series are needed for robust trend estimations ( Dose & Menzel , 2004 ; Rosenzweig et al. , 2007 ) as RB confirmed by our trend modelling . Longer series were RB linked to a higher percentage of significant trends , but assuming comparable variability and NN rates , greater statistical power MD be expected to lead to an increase in significance . Although DT proportion of trends WDT was significant increased , mean advances of spring and summer phases decreased in DT extended period beyond 2000 , especially for fruit trees and wild plants , but RB to a lesser degree for crops . This confirms findings of a review by Piao et al. ( 2019 ) of decelerated or even reversed trends in recent NNS . Only farmers ’ spring activities exhibited a stronger advance ( −0.116 ± 0.005 days / NN ) in Update which is well explained by considerably earlier dates in 2011 –2018 as shown in DT anomaly plots . PRP was not DT aim of our paper to disentangle DT contribution of DT obvious reasons for this result , but DT moving window approach clearly showed IN spring and winter NN trends exhibited very similar variation overtime , DT is , DT strongest trends in DT 1980 – 2010 period . Thus , PRP is more likely IN a reduction in forcing conditions has driven DT decrease in DT advance of spring and summer phenology ( as reported by Güsewell et al. , 2017 for Switzerland ) than a lack of chilling ( e.g. Fu , Zhao , et al. , 2015 ) . Nevertheless , EX are differences in this decreased sensitivity of NN with leaf unfolding and flowering of fruit trees and wild plant species exhibiting DT strongest decline in trend strength . In autumn , leaf colouring and fall trends now predominantly ( 57 % ) indicated delayed onset dates with a mean positive trend . However since 1951 – 1960 was characterized by earlier mean onset dates , PRP has to be checked whether a prolongation of DT records into DT past ( 1951 –1970 ) might have driven this result . In contrast , farmers ’ activities in autumn were still advancing , but to a lesser degree , although DT percentage of advancing trends slightly decreased . To conclude , any changes in leaf colouring and fall dates are still not well understood . With ongoing NN NN , more heat and drought extremes , such as in 2003 , 2015 and 2018 , in conjunction with biotic disturbances might lead to premature leaf senescence interfering with correct observation of autumn phenophases . EX was still a lengthening of DT growing season of ~ 0.26 days / NN and this lengthening only marginally decreased in DT most recent decade confirming JJ other studies ( e.g. Kolářová , Nekovář , & Adamík , 2014 ) . In this respect our paper disagrees with DT findings of Chen et al. ( 2019 ) , likely because species other than trees were RB incorporated in our spring signal . In contrast , DT FS was shortened by − 0.15 days / NN due to a smaller advancing trend in farmers ’ spring activities than in DT development of wild plant species , matching DT previous findings of Estrella et al. ( 2007 ) . In principle , farmers themselves should profit from this earlier start of DT ( abiotic ) growing season , RB by using more cold tolerant cultivars of maize and summer cereals , but according to Parker , Shonkwiler , and Aurbacher ( 2017 ) this advance is buffered by still severe minimum temperatures . Equally , crop ripening and harvest ( F ) MD RB be partially triggered by DT choice of early versus late ‐maturing cultivars ( Peltonen ‐Sainio & Jauhiainen , 2014 ) , explaining DT shortened crop generative period . DT control of phenology by seasonal NN patterns ( Lapenis et al. , 2014 ) leads to a variation in DT phenological signal over NN , with NN of DT NN , site and elevation . Our results , for nearly all phases , match findings of stronger advancing trends at higher elevations ( e.g. Ziello , Estrella , Kostova , Koch , & Menzel , 2009 ) resulting , for example , in a more uniform spring across elevations ( Vitasse et al. , 2018 ) . Across DT seasons DT strongest advances in spring phenology were observed for early flowering species and / or very warm sites . Modelling clearly confirmed differential advances : Farmers ’ activities in spring and autumn only advanced at half of DT rate , whereas ripening phases and especially crop vegetative phases in spring advanced more than DT mean rate of ~ 0.22 days / NN . PRP is important to notice IN spring development of winter cereals is ( at least ) comparable to DT of fruit trees and wild species . Nonwoody and insect‐pollinated plant species advanced less than wind ‐pollinated species , which was RB found in DT western Mediterranean ( Gordo & Sanz , 2009 ) . Advancing trends reached their maximum rates when starting at ~ 1978 , a finding which corresponds to DT reported 1980s regime shift ( Reid et al. , 2016 ) . Although DT NN pattern varied over NN , DT ( still ) advancing trends MD be attributed to NN . More specifically , based on percentages of significant trends matching DT NN , advancing farming activities are likely , ripening phases in summer are very likely and phenological spring phases , such as leaf unfolding and flowering , are very or extremely likely to mirror DT increasing temperatures . DT spatial approach confirmed this attribution , however , to a lesser degree . Seasonal NN was significantly associated with spring phases ’ advance in fruit trees and wild plant species , generative phases in crops as well as farmers ’ activities mirroring winter and spring NN ( descending order , F not with spring NN ) . Advancing farmers ’ summer activities clearly mirrored summer and autumn NN patterns . DT association in autumn was reversed with below average NN in winter and spring being linked to advanced leaf colouring and fall ( see equally Estrella & Menzel , 2006 ; Zohner & Renner , 2019 ) and less NN in summer being linked to advanced farmers ’ autumn activities . Most interestingly , what has been described as carry ‐over effects ( Sparks , Buras , Estrella , & Menzel , 2020 ; Zohner & Renner , 2019 ) , is depicted by this attribution analysis , where below average NN in summer was linked to advancing phenological trends in spring ( FWv , FWg , F ) . Thus , formal attribution of phenological trends does not only shape a formal fingerprint in nature , but additionally fosters a deeper understanding of DT drivers . DT results of DT updated NN are relevant in a number of ways . A stronger advance of early spring wind ‐pollinated species leads to an earlier start of DT allergenic pollen season . Citizen NNS can still observe NN NN in their backyard and these spring advances including a lengthening of DT growing season are to a large extent attributable to NN , although our refined analysis on nine clusters showed DT superiority of fruit trees and wild species in this respect . A tricky question to be investigated in DT future is why summer ripening phases of fruit trees and wild species do not mirror any NN pattern , whereas summer harvesting in agriculture does . Our results clearly underline IN farmers ’ decisions ( weaker trends and smaller trend changes in spring and autumn ) MD be driven by other factors as well , although farmers seem to respond / adapt since their activities in spring were DT only phase to exhibit stronger advancing trends in Update . A shortening of DT crop generative period MD have undesired consequences for yield , but will allow more intercropping or earlier sowing of winter cereals . Results of our comprehensive analysis of DT complete plant phenological data set in these three Central European NNS underline IN DT ecological consequences of these changes are challenging to be assessed due to inherent variation of changes over NN , season , with topography and plant traits , but this variation does not hamper NN NN attribution ."

For example , when an asteroid hit DT NNP 66 million NNS ago , DT resulting dinosaur extinction led mammals to take their place . My colleagues and I have published JJ research on DT mass extinction WDT took place 359 million NNS ago at DT boundary between DT Devonian and Carboniferous geological periods . EX have been JJ previous speculations as to DT cause of this event , including volcanic eruptions , asteroid impacts , NN NN , NN level changes , wildfires and DT rise of DT first forests . But PRP have shown IN DT extinctions on land at this NN MD have been caused by a catastrophic thinning of DT ozone layer WDT let in damaging levels of ultra-violet radiation . Something similar contributed to DT mass extinctions at DT end of DT Permian and Triassic periods , but these events were caused by volcanic eruptions . Our research suggests DT NNP has a natural internal process triggered by a VBG NN WDT can destroy DT ozone layer , a serious warning for our own period of NN NN . DT Late Devonian extinction played a significant role in DT development of vertebrate life . PRP included DT loss of DT dominant group of armoured freshwater fish . DT survivors were DT sharks and DT rather minor group of bony fish WDT subsequently spread out to dominate our younger oceans . DT event RB shaped our own evolution because PRP led to DT extinction of DT first four - legged “ tetrapods ” . These were “ fish ” whose fins had evolved to become limbs with between six and eight fingers and toes . DT first land - dwelling tetrapods with five fingers and toes – our ancestors – do n’t appear in DT fossil record until after this extinction . To find out exactly what caused DT Late Devonian extinction , PRP looked for evidence of what happened in DT atmosphere WDT was captured by fossilised plants from before and after DT event . In particular , PRP looked at DT resistant walls of DT microscopic remains of pollen and spores , taken from fossils found in East Greenland and released by dissolving DT rock samples in acid . DT resistant walls of spores and pollen are RB to protect DT cell contents from ultra-violet radiation . But EX is a brief interval between DT creation of a JJ cell and DT formation of its protective wall when PRP is vulnerable . DT kinds of spores PRP examined are covered in small spines WDT are normally identical in length and have perfectly pointed tips . But most of DT spines in our samples were malformed in a wild variety of shapes , suggesting DT DNA of their cells was damaged by ultra-violet radiation . This suggests IN DT NNP ’s protective ozone shield was down as DT spores were formed . Other spores and pollen had pigmented walls WDT acted as a protective tan , enabling those plants to survive . But a number of important plant groups quickly became extinct and DT forest ecosystem collapsed . Those groups WDT survived were still disrupted and PRP took several million NNS to rebuild , creating quite a different ecosystem in DT process . Our samples came from a very large ancient lake WDT existed all NN round despite being in a very arid part of DT NN . Such lakes only form when glaciers collapse and DT NN ’s seasonal monsoon is very active due to solar heat , so DT JJ NN must have been in a NN period . Other NNS have shown IN high summer temperatures over continental areas can increase DT transport of NN vapour high into DT atmosphere . This NN vapour carries with PRP organic carbon compounds WDT include chlorine , which are produced naturally by a wide variety of plants , algae and fungi . Once these compounds are near DT ozone layer , PRP release DT chlorine and this breaks down ozone molecules . This produces a positive feedback loop because a collapsing terrestrial ecosystem will release a flush of nutrients into DT oceans , which can cause a rapid increase in algae . So DT more DT ozone layer is damaged , DT more plants die , and DT more ozone - damaging compounds are released . Later on , DT ozone layer will naturally recover as DT NN cools and DT algae helps remove carbon dioxide from DT atmosphere . DT discovery of this potential JJ extinction mechanism indicates IN a NN NN , such as PRP have now , has DT potential to erode DT ozone layer to let in damaging ultra-violet radiation . This has consequences for all life on NNP , both on DT land and in shallow waters . PRP believe PRP is as important as recognising IN asteroid impacts caused mass extinctions . Once PRP knew about DT consequences of asteroid impacts , EX followed an intense collective research effort to assess DT threat . PRP now plot DT paths of all large extra-terrestrial objects likely to come close to DT NNP ’s orbit . Similarly , PRP now need to focus effort on understanding DT links between JJ NN and DT production and atmospheric transport of chlorine - bearing carbon compounds WDT have DT potential to cause similar destruction of our ozone layer . PRP now need to make further studies of DT rocks with malformed spores to work out DT duration of DT extinction and DT likely rate of temperature NN required to push enough ozone - destroying chemicals high into DT atmosphere . PRP RB VBP to do ultra-violet malformation experiments on living fern - IN plants which have spiny spores ."

Over DT last century , DT average surface temperature of DT NNP has increased by about 1.0o F . DT eleven warmest NNS this century have all occurred since 1980 , with 1995 DT warmest on record . DT higher latitudes have warmed more than DT equatorial regions . Beginning in 1979 , satellites have been used to measure DT temperature of DT atmosphere up to a height of 30,000 feet . DT long - term surface record and DT recent satellite observations differ , but DT fact is not surprising : DT two techniques measure DT temperature of different parts of DT NNP system ( DT surface , and various layers of DT atmosphere ) . In addition to this , a variety of factors , such as DT presence of airborne materials from DT 1991 eruption of DT volcano Mt. Pinatubo , affect each record in a different way . Satellite observations were initially interpreted as showing a slight cooling , but more recent analyses accounting for natural , short - term fluctuations imply NN , just as DT ground - based measurements have indicated over a longer NN period . As more data from DT satellite record become available , and as DT quality of measurements is improved , comparison of these two records should yield additional insights . What does NN do ? A warmer NNP speeds up DT JJ NN cycle : DT exchange of NN among DT oceans , atmosphere , and land . Higher temperatures cause more evaporation , and soils will tend to dry out faster . Increased amounts of NN in DT atmosphere will mean more rain or snow overall . PRP MD be seeing DT first signs of changes in DT NN cycle . Since DT beginning of DT century , precipitation in DT NNP NNPS has increased by about 6 percent , while DT frequency of intense precipitation events ( heavy downpours of more than two inches per day ) has increased by 20 percent . Such events can cause flooding , soil erosion , and even loss of life . In some midcontinental areas , increased evaporation has led to drought because DT heavy rains fell elsewhere . EX is RB evidence IN ecosystems are reacting to NN . Between 1981 and 1991 , DT length of DT growing season in DT northern high latitudes ( between 45 oand 70o N ) increased by a total of up to twelve days , as documented by satellite imagery . Greening in spring and summer occurred up to eight days earlier , and vegetation continued to photosynthesize an estimated four days longer . JJ mean NN level has risen 4 to 10 inches over DT last 100 NNS , mainly because NN expands when heated . DT melting of glaciers , which has occurred worldwide over DT last century , RB contributes to DT rise . Formerly frozen soils ( permafrost ) in DT Alaskan and Siberian arctic have RB begun to melt , damaging both ecosystems and infrastructure . Melting and tundra NN will RB lead to decay of organic matter and DT release of trapped carbon and methane , creating an additional source of greenhouse gases ."

DT NNP NNP Order , CD NNP Order , or DT Transnational Globalist Republic is only a few steps away . DT traces of those plans lead to Jerusalem and DT bid for power over DT land where Armageddon is predicted to take place .

I am all in all and above all , so IN God , Himself and I , DT Vicar of God , have but CD consistory , and I am able to do almost all WDT God can do . What therefore , can PRP make of me but God . ” Pope Boniface VIII , DT Bull Sanctum , 11/18/1302 . Not JJ NNS understand IN EX are two popes : CD WDT PRP see on official occasions at DT Vatican , dressed in his white ceremonial robes surrounded by his cadre of cardinals , priests , and clergy . This office is currently held by Francis 1 . DT black pope , who is rarely seen , is DT General Superior of DT Society of Jesus , aka , DT Jesuits . This office is currently held by Adolfo Nicolas who lives in DT Vatican in DT Jesuit headquarters . This position was held originally by DT Jesuit founder Ignatius of Loyola . Generally speaking , DT White Pope has always been about centralized power in Rome around a central hierarchy , canon law , and a central bank . DT Jesuits , on DT other hand , have always been about DT ideas of liberation theology , decentralized power through DT Black Pope and his tentacles throughout DT NN – ostensibly DT best intelligence network ever in operation , along with DT schools WDT provide DT indoctrination into Jesuit socialism and theocratic communism . DT White Pope in Rome working through bankers , whether DT original central banks of Venice , Genoa , and Florence , or DT Jewish court bankers IN DT Rothschild family , manipulate political allegiances WDT lead to continuous war . Banks were created in Italian to fund these wars , especially DT crusades . As PRP have explained in our article on DT Military - Industrial Complex , war was lucrative business for DT church and DT bankers . Christians went off to DT Holy Land to defend DT “ land WDT Jesus walked upon ” and keep DT roads open to pilgrims coming to DT sacred sites of Palestine , especially Jerusalem and DT Church of DT Holy Sepulchre . When this church was torn down by Muslims , PRP became DT spark WDT ignited crusade after crusade where millions lost their lives as DT wealth of Europe was grabbed by DT Catholic Church through DT Templars and Italian bankers . JJ pilgrims started in Venice where DT city provided ships , arms , goods , and a place to hold DT pilgrim ’s wealth against DT attacks of DT Muslims on DT road to Jerusalem . DT Templars had castles and fortresses along DT way and banks where PRP MD do business to redeem your wealth on DT roads to DT Holy Land . In Europe , DT Pope received DT lands and wealth of DT nobles VBG off to crusades . DT Vatican funded and manipulated DT wealth of DT nobility to its own aims . DT Knights Hospitaller , DT Templars , and JJ other military and pseudo - military orders arose to channel DT nobility into war for DT Vatican . DT Vatican wants Jerusalem . This battle has never ceased . DT battle still rages today and JJ are used in DT play of Biblical narratives WDT use Jerusalem as DT focal point . DT Vatican lusts for Jerusalem , DT Jesuits worship Jerusalem and of Christ and DT Queen of England owns large parts of Jerusalem , including DT Temple Mount . All three faiths of “ DT book ” VBP Jerusalem , DT Jews and DT Palestinians both VBP Jerusalem , and DT location of DT War of Armageddon is near Jerusalem . Because of DT critical role Jerusalem plays , PRP PRP is set to become DT home of a “ CD NN NN ” WDT combines religious , judicial , and JJ branches into a “ JJ corporation ” WDT unites all nations . PRP can see IN DT scenario is prepared for DT War of Armageddon . In Syria , Gog and Magog , Russia and NNP are amassing on DT borders of “ Greater Israel . ” This is unprecedented and seen as DT fulfillment of DT prophecies of DT Book of Revelations . JJ nations are battling for Jerusalem as Iran , Iraq and JJ other Muslim nations conspire to destroy Israel . DT Muslims believe their Messiah is near and DT is why Syria is being destroyed . DT Jews await their messiah anxiously to help them build DT third temple . Christians anxiously await DT return of Christ in Jerusalem . DT Jesuits literally believe DT Book of Revelation and PRP say DT NN is now to bring DT physically reincarnated Jesus Christ to Jerusalem as DT King of Jerusalem . Along these lines PRP have already “ anointed ” Juan Carlos as DT King of Jerusalem ( thus RB his heir Felipe VI ) . DT CEO of DT Catholic Church , DT White Pope DT White Pope is DT CEO of DT Catholic Church and has always used “ other banks ” to provide interest on money because DT church at CD NN condemned ( now just disapproves ) usury . DT Knights of Malta are CD remnant of an age old system of banking and wealth controlled through DT White Pope and DT Vatican Bank . When PRP see pictures of White Pope Francis with DT Knights of Malta , PRP can no longer be naïve IN PRP are a charity organization WDT just happens to dress up in military outfits , complete with swords . DT White Pope and DT Knights of Malta are completely corrupt , all DT while parading as a charity . EX is another group WDT is within and above DT Knights of Malta called DT Equestrian Order of DT Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem who are sworn to defend DT White Pope even above DT famous French Guard . Now PRP are at DT very apex of DT pyramid structure . King Juan Carlos I of Spain and his heir Felipe VI are protectors of DT Jesuits and PRP ( Carlos or his son ) are head of DT Equestrian Order . Keep in mind IN DT Jesuits and DT Knights of Malta have fought over DT island of Malta for centuries . Two factions . CD island . But not just any island , CD WDT represents control of DT entire NN order . Juan Carlos is a Jesuit through and through as DT head of DT Order of Calatrava . His Merovingian blood lineage names him as “ holy blood ” from DT fabled “ wondrous child ” WDT was born to Mary Magdalene and carried to France with Mary ( DT Mother of Jesus ) and DT other Mary ( her sister ) . If legend is true , Juan Carlos I and Felipe VI are heirs of Jesus of Nazareth and hold DT title of King of Jerusalem . DT King of Spain is RB head of DT Equestrian Order of DT Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem and Juan Carlos is DT NNP of DT Organization of Ibero - American NNPS . DT Ibero - American Union , which includes DT European Union , of which DT NNP Kingdom is a member , includes 700 million NNS in Europe , DT Mediterranean and South American . : Carlos and Felipe ’s cousins Prince Phillip , Prince Charles and his son William , who is to be crowned King of England this summer , hold DT same claim to being DT King of Jerusalem . DT Windsors claim to be DT true Monarchs of Europe ( European Union ) and Jerusalem through Merovingian blood lines with DT protection of DT Knights of Malta and DT Vatican through DT White Pope . Yet DT Juan Carlos line claims DT same title as King of Jerusalem through DT Equestrian Order of DT Holy Sepulchre . DT Windsors work with DT White Pope Francis I through DT Knights of Malta . So who does Juan Carlos works through ? EX is RB a JJ twist to this age old battle for power in DT White Pope Francis I is a Jesuit . : This is DT first NN in history IN DT Pope was RB a Jesuit . “ DT Jesuits have a vow to obey DT pope , but if DT pope is a Jesuit , maybe he should have a vow to obey DT superior general of DT Jesuits … I feel IN I ’m still a Jesuit in terms of my spirituality , what I have in my heart . ” Francis I Thus , PRP appears DT Jesuits have won DT centuries ’ old battle between DT Jesuits ( and DT Black Pope ) and DT Knights of Malta ( and DT White Pope ) . In Pope Francis PRP have both . Almost . But Adolfo Nicolas is still DT Black Pope and head of DT Society of Jesus . Unless … … something happens IN : Fr. General Nicolás Will Convoke GC 36 and Intends to Retire DT Jesuit Black Pope is scheduled to “ step down ” sometime in 2016 . This will open DT stage for CD of DT last steps of DT plan to Armageddon . What Happens When DT White Pope Becomes DT Black Pope ? PRP MD only seem logical for DT Vatican to announce sometime soon IN PRP will unify DT two pope positions and create DT first all - in - CD pope WDT combines both streams . This is another reason why Pope Benedict XVI had to retire ! DT plan was set in motion long ago . Popes serve until PRP die . Benedict and Nicolas will be some of DT only popes in history — either white or black — who left their office before death . : CHECK MATE . DT centuries ’ long battle in DT Catholic Church between White and Black will soon be over and DT Jesuits are positioned for NN domination . What PRP should all be watching for is DT next step : DT White Pope Francis I will be elected DT JJ Jesuit Black Pope . DT White and Black Popes will combine for DT first NN in history . PRP might say IN EX will be a “ Grey Pope ” who will combine DT work of DT White and DT Black Popes into CD job , CD agenda , CD NN plan to try and fulfill DT apocalyptic predictions of DT War of Armageddon and DT return of Jesus in a physical body to conquer Jerusalem and rule DT NN . DT JJ Gray Pope will move to Jerusalem to lead a NNP Council of Churches WDT governs DT “ free ” realm of religious belief and practice and its implications in DT social sphere . He can already hear in DT White Pope ’s words what he has planned and is preaching openly : “ Jesus Christ , Jehovah , Allah . These are all names employed to describe an entity WDT is distinctly DT same across DT NN . For centuries , blood has been needlessly shed because of DT desire to segregate our faiths . This , however , should be DT very concept which unites PRP as NNS , as nations , and as a NN bound by faith . Together , PRP can bring about an unprecedented age of peace , all PRP need to achieve such a NN is respect each other ’s beliefs , for PRP are all NNS of God regardless of DT name PRP choose to address him by . PRP can accomplish miraculous things in DT NN by merging our faiths , and DT NN for such a movement is now . ” Francis I DT White Pope wants to merge all religions and kill DT Catholic Church as PRP VBP Her . He is transitioning to a NNP Church where all beliefs are equal and DT same . All religions will be merged into a grey religious JJ NN order headed by DT JJ Gray Pope . Francis will be DT head of this church and Jerusalem will be its JJ home . DT Last Christmas Was Announced DT is why Francis and others have spoken VBN publicly IN Christmas 2015 was DT last Christmas . “ While DT NN starves , burns , and descends further into chaos , PRP should realize IN this NN ’s Christmas celebrations for those who choose to celebrate PRP MD be their last . ” Francis I VIDEO : Pope Says This is DT Last Christmas . As PRP hear DT uncertainty in his words , “ MD be their last ” , PRP can only wonder what he means . Perhaps EX will be no Christmas because EX will be no Christianity , per se . Perhaps a CD NNP Religion will become DT only accepted practice and all others are mere earlier stages of this JJ amalgamated religion . Francis seems quite dramatic about DT “ end of days ” IN he speaks about so often . He even believes IN a NNP War III has already begun and IN he is DT Social Judge of all WDT is right and good for DT entire globe , no matter what religion , country , or race . But did n’t DT Queen of England RB say IN 2015 MD be DT final Christmas , too ? VIDEO : Queen says 2015 Will Be Final Christmas . DT Redistribution Agenda of DT Gray Pope ? DT Gray Pope will be a common Pope of all NNS who rules DT NN through his social and environmental programs WDT raise DT poor up out of DT sin of poverty . What Francis does n’t mention is who is VBG to pay for this . He rails against poverty as DT springboard for NN - wide social reform , led by his holiness . “ Inequality is DT root of social evil . ” Francis I “ A contribution to this equitable development will RB be made both by international activity aimed at DT integral human development of all DT NN ’s peoples and by DT legitimate redistribution of JJ benefits by DT NNP , as well as indispensable cooperation between DT private sector and civil society . ” Francis I PRP have heard Francis I call for redistribution of DT wealth to raise DT poor to an “ equal ” status with DT now wealthy . This type of rhetoric is beautiful but impractical if not impossible to manifest . This “ Theocratic Socialism ” is another name for DT Liberation Theology of DT Jesuits . PRP is a type of “ socialist communism ” ran by DT church , or more specifically , DT Jesuits in DT church . When DT White Pope Francis I becomes DT Black Pope , DT Jesuits have won DT battle . Theocratic Socialism , instead of democratic monarchies will rule . CD Pope , CD religion , CD NN order of Jesuit inspired socialism will govern from DT Holy Land and redistribute DT remaining wealth of DT NN ( aka , any wealth DT Jesuits do n’t control already ) . DT old wealth of monarchies and insider intelligence groups IN DT Knights of Malta , DT Pilgrim Society , DT Bilderbergs , Trilateralists , Warlord Bankers and offshore tax havens will all collapse as DT JJ regime of theocratic socialism run by Transnational globalists dissolve DT JJ wealth of DT criminal activities of mafias , royalty , and rich WDT has accumulated over hundreds of NNS . DT old wealth of DT Catholic Church itself will be dissolved as DT JJ center of DT religious NN becomes Jerusalem . PRP is very likely IN DT Gray Pope will rule from DT Temple Mount in a temple WDT will fulfill DT prophecies of a third Jewish temple . But EX will have to be strong international legal ( courts ) and JJ ( military ) components of this plan for NN hegemony and Francis I has already named DT organization WDT will carry out his social plans . In his recent visit to DT NNP Nations earlier this NN ( 2016 ) he VBD : “ Consequently , while encouraging PRP [ DT NNP Nations ] in your continuing efforts to coordinate DT activity of DT international agencies , which represents a service to all humanity , I urge PRP to work together in promoting a true , worldwide ethical mobilization which , beyond all differences of religious or political convictions , will spread and put into practice a shared ideal of fraternity and solidarity , especially with regard to DT poorest and those most excluded . ” Francis I This type of “ fraternity and solidarity ” between DT rich and DT poor has been DT cause of countless wars . EX will be no leveling of wealth without dramatic political , JJ , and military intervention . DT rich will not join DT CD NNP Religion if PRP means loosing wealth . This battle has been waged for some NN and is now at a fever ’s pitch . “ DT NN has not understood DT way of peace . DT whole NN is at war . Even today , after DT second failure of another NN war , perhaps PRP can speak of a third war , CD fought piecemeal , with crimes , massacres , destruction . ” Francis I Pope Francis is in a war , a battle between white and black – charity and dominion . He believes IN by taking away all of DT guns and weapons in DT NN , he MD demand peace between all nations . Steps IN DT NNP Nations Small Arms Treaty are along DT lines WDT Francis recommends . Take away DT weapons , make all religions DT same , and institute CD NN NN . And as PRP have seen , DT NNP Nations is DT chosen vehicle WDT Francis will use to enact his final play — DT disarmament of DT NNP NNPS citizenry . Most NNS will agree IN DT NNP Nations is already well on DT way to creating DT substructure WDT will be necessary to create DT NNP NNP Order – as PRP was named by George H. W. Bush in his inaugural address . Every NN since Bush has RB blindly supported DT agencies and programs of DT NNP Nations . As this website has accurately pointed out : Will Juan Carlos ( or Felipe ) be Crowned King of DT NNP ? CD of DT final steps towards Armageddon will be DT election of Juan Carlos ( or Felipe VI ) as DT NN of DT NNP Nations which will maintain DT international agencies already housed in Geneva , DT Swiss Canton WDT is ruled by Juan Carlos and Felipe through DT House of Savoy . DT original League of Nations building will become DT JJ home of DT NNP Nations General Assembly . As depicted in DT Apocalypse of St. John , ten kings will serve DT CD king who sits on DT ancient throne . This will usher in a JJ NN direction of international cooperation WDT will hopefully stem DT tide of Armageddon . Francis will work through Juan Carlos ( Felipe VI ) as DT King of Jerusalem , DT NNP of DT NNP Nations , and DT Jesuit anointed head of DT Equestrian Order WDT has sown allegiance to protect and defend DT Pope . PRP has not been a self - evident conclusion IN Juan Carlos ( Felipe VI ) MD be DT best person for DT job of NN of DT NNP Nations . Our intel indicates IN Prince Charles ( or DT rumored coronation of Prince William WDT keeps popping up from NN to NN ) have been battling behind DT scenes for DT job , but have lost DT battle , hence no need to crown DT Queen ’s successor . DT peculiar behavior of Prince Charles makes more sense when PRP VBP he was ( is ) trying to appear as a good candidate for DT position . Rumors have PRP IN both Bill NNP and Barack Obama covet DT position . PRP imagine IN if DT Queen were not so advanced in NNS , she , too , MD assume DT position should be hers . For if a Windsor MD gain international power , DT wealth of DT monarchies and DT Knights of Malta might remain secure and hidden . Juan Carlos and Felipe are excellent candidates for DT position and with DT help of DT Jesuits and DT Knights of Malta , PRP are assured victory especially in light of DT dark side of DT Windsor family WDT is coming into JJ light . Hardly anyone believes IN DT Queen is what she says she is . Elizabeth is more than likely DT richest person on NNP if her entire offshore holdings were counted . JJ say DT Windsors have done little to help others and DT NN theorists rave on about DT fraud , corruption , and evil of DT English Crown . DT death of Princess Diana and Prince Charles ’s affair strikes Charles , and thus his whole family , from DT short list of candidates for NNP of DT UN . Charles is continuously saying callous things WDT show he has little compassion or any understanding of DT real NN . Here are a few quotes from Prince Charles WDT will not win him approval from DT Pope : “ PRP [ Christianity ] has no right to challenge Islam or any other religion . PRP is merely a Western face of God . ” “ Do PRP seriously expect me to be DT first Prince of Wales in history not to have a mistress ? “ Islam can teach PRP today a way of understanding and living in DT NN which Christianity itself is poorer for having lost . ” “ EX ’s nothing IN a jolly good disaster to VB NNS to start doing something . ” “ Extremism is no more DT monopoly of Islam than PRP is DT monopoly of other religions , including Christianity . ” Thus , PRP seems evident IN either Juan Carlos or Felipe will be DT chosen NN to lead DT NNP Nations in its battle to bring DT Gray Pope ’s Jesuit socialism to DT NN . And PRP are warned by DT Jesuits IN if PRP do n’t follow along this path , Armageddon is sure to happen . Gog and Magog gather around Jerusalem and DT stage has been set . DT threat of NN annihilation will help engender support for this Jesuit plan of NN hegemony WDT plays off of DT images of Revelations . These battle plans have been in DT works for DT past 120 NNS and only a few final steps need to be made . : Gray Pope = Pope of DT NNP . King of Spain = King of DT NNP . Finally , DT Anglo - Spanish War ( Protestants vs Catholics ) is over . DT Jesuits win . DT NNP Nations has worked tirelessly since its inception as DT League of Nations to roll out DT carpet for a CD NN NN . PRP should have been call “ DT death of nations ” instead of DT league . Every agency , program or fund works to undermine nations not build them up . Until now , DT NNP Nations has been under DT control of DT Transnational Warlord Bankers who created PRP . EX is a strong push now for socialism ( leading to theocratic socialism ) and DT NNP NNP Order . All of DT agencies , programs , funds and aspects of DT NNP Nations focuses on DT redistribution of wealth . PRP is essentially a congress of corporations who all are independent , but use DT NNP Nations as a banner to fly underneath . EX has been little power vested in DT organization which has been demonstrated by DT lackluster success of its efforts . But once DT NNP Nations has been empowered , EX will be no end to DT effectiveness of DT socialist programs already created and waiting to be empowered . PRP have examined transnationalist programs in previous articles , but PRP does n’t hurt to put DT UN under a microscope . Scan below to see some of DT organizations , corporations , programs and funds of DT NNP Nations WDT wish to govern and control DT entire globe as CD international union with ten regions . Specialized Agencies are legally independent international organizations with their own rules , membership , organs and financial resources , were brought into relationship with DT NNP Nations through negotiated agreements . Given DT diversity of their respective fields of action , history and experience , each agency has its own needs and concerns , not to speak of corporate culture . Office of DT NNP Nations High Commissioner for Refugees NNP Nations NNP ’s Fund NNP Nations Conference on Trade and Development International Trade Centre NNP Nations Development Program UNDP Field Offices NNP Nations Capital Development Fund NNP Nations Development Fund for Women NNP Nations Volunteers NNP Nations Environment Program NNP Nations Human Settlements Program NNP Nations Office on Drugs and Crime NNP Nations Population Fund ) NNP Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in DT Near East NN Food Program NNP Nations Institute for Disarmament Research NNP Nations Institute for Training and Research NNP Nations International Research and Training Institute for DT Advancement of Women NNP Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute NNP Nations Research Institute for Social Development Counter - Terrorism Committee International Criminal Tribunal for DT Former Yugoslavia International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda NNP Nations Compensation Commission NNP Nations Monitoring , Verification and Inspection Commission Under DT guise of ecology and sustainability , DT NNP Nations has developed overall goals for all nations . These goals seems optimistic and positive until PRP ask how these things MD happen . In order to accomplish any of these goals , DT NNP Nations MD first have to bring all of these aspects “ under control ” before PRP MD be assessed and managed . Therefore , PRP is an assumption IN NN control of all of DT most important issues for life on NN will become DT domains of DT leaders of DT NNP Nations . Essentially , DT socialistic goals of DT programs of DT NNP Nations will be first turned into a communistic dictatorship to bring all aspects of life under DT control of DT NNP of DT NNP Nations and DT Gray Pope . Even DT court systems WDT mete out justice will be UN agencies . DT Rothschild Family will continue to be DT controlling bankers of DT NN through DT NNP Nations NNP Bank . DT Rothschilds have historically been DT Queen ’s bankers , but PRP are really aligned with Carlos and DT Jesuits . Anybody here VBP to let DT Queen VB “ game over ” ? Here are some DT programs WDT DT NNP Nations has adopted as goals for DT future . If PRP read closely , DT altruism quickly turns to NN domination . • End poverty in all its forms everywhere ( translation : control all wealth ) • End hunger , achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture ( control all food sources ) • Ensure healthy lives and promote well - being for all at all ages ( control all medicine and NN care ) • Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all ( educational brainwashing ) • Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls ( control all females ) • Ensure availability and sustainable management of NN and sanitation for all ( control all resources ) • Ensure access to affordable , reliable , sustainable and modern NN for all ( control all NN ) • Promote sustained , inclusive and sustainable JJ growth , full and productive employment and decent work for all ( contro • l all economies ) Build resilient infrastructure , promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation ( control all industry ) • Reduce inequality within and among NNS ( control all nations ) • Make cities and human settlements inclusive , safe , resilient and sustainable ( control all wars ) • Take urgent action to combat NN NN and its impacts ( control all development ) • Conserve and sustainably use DT oceans , seas and marine resources for sustainable development ( control all NN ) • Protect , restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems , sustainably manage forests , combat desertification , and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss ( control all natural resources ) • Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development , provide access to justice for all and build effective , accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels ( control all courts ) • Strengthen DT means of implementation and revitalize DT NNP Partnership for Sustainable Development ( control all laws ) Transforming our NN : DT 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development This Agenda is an acclaimed plan of action for NNS , DT NN , and prosperity . PRP RB claims to strengthen universal peace in larger freedom . DT 2030 Agenda asserts IN eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions , including extreme poverty , is DT greatest JJ challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development . All NNS and all stakeholders , acting in collaborative partnership , will implement this plan so PRP say . But keep in mind DT very reason DT NN has such extreme poverty is IN DT elite , and mega-rich , monarchs , and Vatican have STOLEN DT NN ’S WEALTH FROM HER NNS . DT 1 % ( soon to be DT .001 % ) have taken everything WDT DT 99 % have worked , toiled , invested , and saved from DT first NN IN a traveler on DT road to DT crusades handed his wealth to a Templar or Hospitaller for safe keeping , only to have PRP confiscated at his death , until today where illicit governments around DT NN continue to rob its citizenry with higher taxes and loss of freedoms . But PRP do n’t VB PRP have caught on to this and their Agenda 2030 continues to read : PRP are resolved to free DT human race from DT tyranny of poverty and VB and to heal and secure our NN . PRP are determined to take DT bold and transformative steps which are urgently needed to shift DT NN onto a sustainable and resilient path . PRP must balance DT three dimensions of sustainable development : DT JJ , social and environmental . ( translation : redistribution of wealth , universal Marshall law , control NN ) NNS – PRP are determined to end poverty and hunger , in all their forms and dimensions , and to ensure IN all human beings can fulfil their potential in dignity and equality and in a healthy environment . NNP – PRP are determined to protect DT NN from degradation , including through sustainable consumption and production , sustainably managing its natural resources and taking urgent action on NN NN , so IN PRP can support DT needs of DT present and future generations . Prosperity – PRP are determined to ensure IN all human beings can enjoy prosperous and fulfilling lives and IN JJ , social and technological progress occurs in harmony with nature . Peace – PRP are determined to foster peaceful , just and inclusive societies which are free from fear and violence . EX can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development . Partnership – PRP are determined to mobilize DT means required to implement this Agenda through a revitalized NNP Partnership for Sustainable Development , based on a spirit of strengthened JJ solidarity , focused in particular on DT needs of DT poorest and most vulnerable and with DT participation of all NNS , all stakeholders and all NNS . These programs of DT NNP Nations are DT best tools to institute Socialistic Communism or Theocratic Socialism WDT any dictator MD VB and PRP fly under DT international banner of charity , love , and DT destruction of poverty . Who does n’t VB to support such lofty ideals ? But DT devil is in DT detail , and DT devil does n’t VB PRP looking at those details . PRP are awake . And PRP will banish DT NNP Nations from U.S. soil and refuse to fund its evil operations as PRP is an enemy within our own country . PRP will indict and prosecute DT JJ traitors in our NN and defund and shut down DT pseudo - NN agencies who are working to destroy our country . American patriots will NEVER give up their Second Amendment Rights to DT NNP Nations and PRP refuse to be a military branch of DT UN . PRP will reinstate DT U.S. Constitution , including DT very important 13th Amendment , and fill FEMA internment camps with traitors of our country , no matter how esteemed PRP make PRP believe PRP are . DT good NN is IN DT NN for Armageddon is not now . DT Jesuits use fear driven apocalyptic narratives to press DT issue of DT second coming of Christ as a NN leader who victoriously rides a white horse into Jerusalem to expel DT Jews and Muslims from DT Holy Land . Jesuits are warriors and soldiers who do n’t hesitate to do whatever PRP takes to forward DT aims of DT Society of Jesus and DT Black Pope . But when DT White Pope RB becomes DT Black Pope – total Jesuit dominion of DT Catholic Church is complete and DT stage is set for DT Jesuit bid for NN domination through DT King of Jerusalem , DT Pope of Jerusalem and their governing body of DT NNP Nations . DT battle is now and DT NN is at hand to recognize DT signs of DT NN and not be duped into believing another globalist narrative IN peace will come when all wealth is gathered and redistributed and all religions are melted down into DT least common denominator . DT Catholic Church has always chosen DT side of DT strong , whether fascist , Jesuit , warlord banker , or Knight of any CD of dozens of orders . Perhaps PRP is NN IN DT Vatican be challenged on its infallibility and moral foundation WDT puts its own interests above those of others . In our next article , PRP will give our readers a detailed plan on DT way out . But in DT meantime , each CD of PRP can do something …. NOW . As PRP are fond of saying in flight jargon , “ Put your mask on first . Then help someone else . ” Whatever PRP are passionate about , VB MORE PASSIONATE about . PRP are passionate about research and writing , so PRP write these articles . If PRP object to forced vaccinations , then host DT VAXXED movie in your community . Or send this link of Robert De Niro to your friends and family . If PRP are aware of DT relationship of DT Second Amendment and our freedom , then teach others — but on a bigger scale than PRP are now . If PRP are concerned about bank bail - ins , then move your money to a community bank or credit union . If PRP do n’t VB your family poisoned by GMOs and pharmaceuticals , then grow your own food or join a CSA and be mindful about DT drugs PRP are taking . If PRP read our article on legal propaganda and do n’t VB to be brainwashed by DT NN , then turn PRP off . If PRP are in a position to help drive legislation to audit DT Federal Reserve System , then keep doing PRP until Congress does its job . If PRP VBP IN 9 - 11 is more nefarious than DT Sixty Minutes interview , then write CBS and let them VB IN PRP will continue to VB your viewership ( which PRP VBP ! ) if PRP continue to reveal DT truth . Be a regular visitor to this site to stay informed about DT real NN of DT day . When PRP can , support independent NN sites through your donations . Congratulations to all DT patriots out RB ! DT reason things are being revealed at an explosive rate these days is because PRP are ALL doing something , a few things , or as much as PRP can , to create DT very havoc and confusion WDT PRP have been hoisting on PRP . PRP are just using DT Cloward - Piven strategy IN DT traitors have been using against PRP – overload DT system until PRP collapses . But PRP is their system PRP are VBG to collapse . : Collectively , by doing what PRP can as individual and community FREEDOM SLEEPER CELLS , PRP are creating a storm WDT will drive DT elite cabal into DT very mountain bunkers PRP have built or themselves for DT end - times ."

By : Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Russian Subscribers In my report I had detailed how an ever increasing number of continuing NN surges have begun hitting our NN , and to DT disruption of our NN ’s weather cycles . Conjointly with DT disruptions of DT NN ’s weather systems has been DT unexplained lighting up of DT winter night skies in DT far Northern Arctic regions , and as summarized in an article WDT VBD in part , "" DT entire horizon is raised IN magic , IN DT hand of God is bringing PRP up . ” More ominous for DT NN ’s human beings perhaps , is IN what has been generally relegated to DT NN ’s Southern Hemispheric regions is now occurring in DT Northern ones too . DT evidence for these increasing NN ‘ blasts ’ are increasingly being pointed towards a number of events WDT have occurred in DT universe in NNS past , and to which PRP are now feeling their effects . CD of these events was DT Supernova Blast ( SN1987a ) WDT occurred on , and as explained by Peter Garnavich of DT University of Notre Dame , "" DT real fireworks show is finally starting , and over DT next 10 NNS things will VB spectacular . ” But , and as RB contained in this information , DT NN line for DT NN ’s visibility of this event lies between DT NNS of 1995 - 2015 . Current events are suggesting however IN these events are VBG to be occurring much sooner than 2010 . DT fear evident in Western NNS regarding this event belongs to their theories about Supernovas , and IN NN IN PRP are CD of DT most energetic explosive events known . “ PRP occur at DT end of a star 's lifetime , when its nuclear fuel is exhausted and PRP is no longer supported by DT release of nuclear NN . If DT star is particularly massive , then its core will collapse and in so doing will release a huge amount of NN . ” In a particularly strange event surrounding SN1987a , American NNS ‘ reworked ’ existing theories about supernovas to show not what is necessarily true , but rather what PRP seemingly wanted to see . ( Or more ominously to keep this knowledge hidden from others . ) This ‘ reworking ’ though , still revealed DT nervousness about this event by DT American NNS , and as evidenced in DT comment by Dr. Neil Gehrels of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center when he stated , "" DT possibility for mass extinction is indeed real , yet DT risk seems much lower than PRP have thought . "" This American reworking of these formulas to obtain DT results PRP desired left out DT continued ozone layer depletion over DT Southern Hemispheric Pole , and which according to DT currently ongoing 2004 British survey NNS , “ DT ozone layer over much of DT Southern Hemisphere south of 50° remains around 10 % below DT long term normal . ” Where in past times ozone layer depletion was rightly ascribed to cosmic rays ( gamma rays ) , Western NNS have with their reworked mathematics created a whole JJ methodology WDT blames these depletions on CFC’s ( chlorofluorocarbons ) , and which even first term Russian school child MD laugh about if this were not so serious an event . Best stated about these events from a Western perspective though are these words from an unknown person , “ Now , do n't VB me wrong ; I 'm not in favor of ANY strange laboratory - created substances polluting DT air I have to breathe , and I wholeheartedly endorse DT current campaign to rid DT atmosphere of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) , DT atoms being blamed for DT so - called "" holes "" in DT ozone layer . But just stop for a minute and VB : If CFCs caused DT so - called "" holes , "" why are PRP ONLY over DT ? Are DT polar explorers and NNS using too much spray - on deodorant and fly - killer ? Of course not . If CFCs had much to do at all with DT so - called "" holes , "" then DT "" holes "" MD be over , or , or , or at least somewhere relative to these places where PRP MD be shown IN DT air currents were causing DT CFCs to accumulate . But PRP are not . DT "" holes "" only occur in two places , over DT North and , exactly in accordance with natural forces which create DT bulk of ozone , and exactly in accordance with DT theories and predictions of DT NNS who discovered them in DT first place . Western NN has a long history of contradicting itself , and this NN is no exception , and as stated in this research paper contributed to by a number of American educational institutions shows , "" Long - term effects of gamma ray bursts MD spread around DT NNP and include ozone layer depletion , JJ cooling , acid rain and radionuclide production . "" So today as DT NN is awash in acid rain , DT ozone layers at DT Northern and Southern Hemispheric Poles are expanding , DT Western NNS put before their ever growing uneducated citizens a scientific explanation WDT blames these events on CFCs and fossil fuels , when PRP VBP DT NN behind these assertions is totally false . An independent American researcher , Ricardo L. Carezani , in his article titled , “ SN 1987 A and DT Neutrino ” says PRP best in describing Western NNS ’ penchant for making facts fit their absurd assertions ; “ Putting together all 7 facts , DT * overwhelming * neutrino evidence is replaced by an overwhelming evidence of "" DT pharaoh 's NN "" ( i.e. nothing ) . For those of PRP not familiar with DT pharaoh 's NN , PRP can perform PRP yourself with a table and ruler : measure an arbitrary number of table parts , use an arbitrary equation , and come up with PI . Anyone can do PRP ! Really !! ” Coming literally on DT heels of this Supernova event was DT most astronomically significant event of human history with DT most powerful explosion in DT universe since DT Big Bang WDT occurred in December , 1997 . “ Astronomers are mystified by DT most powerful explosion ever witnessed , an enormous burst of gamma ray NN 12 billion light NNS from NNP WDT in CD second released almost as much NN as all DT stars of DT universe . ” ; and as stated in this article by DT American NN source CNN . NASA Headquarters at DT Goddard Space Flight Center further added about this event : “ A recently detected cosmic gamma ray burst released a hundred times more NN than previously theorized , making PRP DT most powerful explosion since DT creation of DT universe in DT Big Bang . ” For about CD or two seconds , this burst was as luminous as all DT rest of DT entire universe , "" VBD Caltech professor George Djorgovski , CD of DT two principal investigators on DT team from DT California Institute of Technology , Pasadena , CA . Aside from DT majority of Western peoples being ignorant of these events , Western NNS , at least publicly , are still not acknowledging DT significance of them for all of DT NN ’s peoples . Even with hundreds of thousands lying dead in EX can be no expectation IN Western peoples will either become knowledgeable about or heed these JJ universal warnings . As incredible as PRP MD seem to PRP Russians , Western NNS , ( and especially DT Americans ) these Social Darwinist thinking human beings , fail to even see DT connection between DT last American space shuttle disaster , DT present lighting of DT Arctic Regions of DT Northern Hemisphere and continuing JJ weather chaos ! PRP even have NN ordered training of their NNS through their educational systems WDT indoctrinate them into this way of being ! DT parents and grandparents of these NNS even willingly hand over their NNS to these mass indoctrination centers , and with their knowing DT destructiveness of these institutions from DT very examples our own Russian history has shown them . DT Western NN did report IN , “ Upper atmosphere MD hold clues in mystery ” in an article WDT appeared in an American national publication , USA Today . This article VBZ in part , “ DT space shuttle Columbia 's troubles began as PRP dropped IN a meteor from orbit into a mysterious and poorly understood atmospheric region WDT NNS have dubbed DT "" ignorosphere ” . DT Concorde , DT supersonic jet , flies in DT bottom of this region at more than 11 miles above DT NNP 's surface . Nothing but a rocket can fly at its upper limit of 53 miles . DT "" ignorosphere "" encompasses DT mesosphere and upper stratosphere . Invisible clouds , strange electrical flashes called red sprites and blue lightning bolts WDT strike upward from DT tops of clouds inhabit DT thin air . This is DT place where falling stars are made . DT "" ignorosphere "" earns its nickname from DT fact IN PRP can't VB RB from here without a rocket . PRP is too high for weather balloons and too low for satellites to dip down to gather information . DT connection to these seemingly disconnected events is DT rare NN phenomena called Noctilucent Clouds . What are Noctilucent Clouds ? “ NLC were first discovered in DT summer of 1884 after DT eruption of Krakatoa which occurred in 1883 . DT volcanic eruption was at first thought to have contributed to DT formation of NLC due to DT ejection of huge quantities of dust into DT upper atmosphere ; however PRP has been proven IN DT eruption was not responsible for their formation . ” DT actual "" discoverer "" is debated , however recent work has shown IN DT first conclusive observations were performed by T.W. Backhouse from Sunderland , U.K. Gadsden and Schroder ( 1989 ) question why Noctilucent Clouds were not discovered prior to 1885 and suggest IN DT eruption of Krakatoa was significant in IN PRP caused observers to take more of a careful note of DT twilight skies . This is a very difficult hypothesis to comprehend as PRP suggests IN no observers ever bothered to take note of DT twilight sky . This is a highly unlikely scenario as PRP is MD seem very improbable IN astronomers and meteorologists who frequently observed MD miss such a highly conspicuous phenomena . Of such concern are these phenomenal Noctilucent Clouds WDT a number of Western scientific studies are underway in DT search for DT answers as to why PRP are increasing , and to DT extent IN light from them is being reflected back into DT normally darkened winter skies . “ Increased sightings of noctilucent clouds MD be related to NN NN . ” VBZ CD of these research studies underway by an organization named CAWSES ( NNP and Weather of DT Sun- NNP System ) , and as stated in their report titled : A proposed JJ SCOSTEP Program for 2004 - 2008 . Another NN being conducted is by DT HAIL Project ( Holographic Array for Ionospheric Lightning ) , associated with DT American Stanford University , where their approach is being directed towards , “ Direct electrodynamic coupling between lightning discharges and DT mesosphere / lower ionosphere evidenced by spectacular luminous optical NNS known as red sprites and elves , VLF signatures of rapid conductivity changes and radar detection of transient ionization patches above a thunderstorms . ” Specifically , these increasing cosmic ray bursts hitting our NN are causing , among other things , an ever increasing amount of upper atmosphere lighting occurrences WDT are RB disturbing our NN ’s magnetic field and causing such bad things to happen as small planes falling out of DT sky due to disruptions in our magnetic field . These are best known to aircraft pilots as gravity , or buoyancy waves . “ Gravity , or buoyancy waves , are pressure waves generated by disturbances within DT atmosphere , where DT restoring forces ( potential NN ) for DT wave motion is provided by buoyancy and gravity , rather than compression / expansion as in higher frequency acoustic waves . ” Coinciding with all of these events have been DT Americans associating them with their older NNS ’s knowledge ( to them myths and legends ) and warnings of not only these events , but DT future events to come . Such an example is DT association of DT 1987 Supernova ( SN1987a ) with a deliberately planted falsehood of PRP being DT ‘ Blue Star ’ much talked about in DT Hopi American Indian legend . DT problem is IN DT much reported on Hopi ‘ Blue Star ’ , and its significance , is a lie . This is able to be so because DT ‘ power ’ involved with Social Darwinism is IN PRP subverts in DT human being their ability to find truths within themselves and surrenders PRP to DT mass propaganda of DT NNP . IN DT National Socialistic System ( Nazi ) of during DT Great Patriotic War ( NNP War II ) DT individuals not in step with DT masses are cast outside their social folds . For this particular example PRP can see IN DT beginnings of these rumors WDT DT Hopi peoples had in their older NNS ’s stories a Blue Star began not with DT Hopi peoples but with two Western NNS , Thomas E. Mails , in his book titled “ DT Hopi Survival Kit ” and Moira Timms with her book titled “ Beyond Prophecies and Predictions ” . "" I am nobody . I am not a shaman , a medicine man , a guru , a channeler , or a psychic . I am not an ex-intelligence officer from DT CIA , DT NSA , DT secret services or any other branch of any service . I am not DT reincarnation of an ancient being , an ancient deity or a heavenly visitor . I have nothing to offer PRP in DT way of credibility . I am a nobody ... and I VBP PRP DT way . "" ---Robert Morning Sky , introducing himself in an article called , "" DT Blue Star Hoax "" WDT appeared in LEADING EDGE # 95 . Among other things , Morning Sky , a Hopi , claimed IN DT fabled "" Blue Star "" does not exist in Hopi legends , teachings or mythology . PRP was a term WDT he invented in DT early 1970's WDT has since been pirated by researchers who falsely claimed to have spent NN with Hopi Elders learning DT secrets of DT Blue Star Kachina ( a kachina WDT Morning Sky says does n't exist ) , and channelers , psychics and clairvoyants who claim to have received Blue Star revelations from their spiritual sources . As PRP VBP in about DT older NNS of DT NN , PRP is RB possible IN their trickster nature has been at play here when PRP comes to their interactions with DT Western peoples of DT NN . Such exactly are DT NNS of DT Kachina Cult , and who DT Western NNS call DT Hopi . DT Western NNS ’s ‘ everything ’ is separate , nothing is ‘ connected ’ NN view contributes to their beliefs IN ‘ their ’ older peoples are disassociated with DT other older peoples of DT NN , and therefore gives them no understanding IN all of DT earths older peoples are DT same in thought and spirit about all things . DT mythical lies and NN organized propaganda facing DT Western NNS ’s however keep them locked away from DT incredible mysteries surround these events I ’ve presented here before PRP today . In my last letter to my American subscribers , and to which I ’ve RB shared with all of PRP , titled “ Now Visible Comet Heralds Warning of Doom to NNP ” I wrote about DT significance of this JJ ‘ Green Comet ’ and PRP ’s historical meaning to PRP living in these NNS of great tribulation and coming cataclysms , if only PRP listen to DT earths older peoples and DT universe itself and learn their songs . In DT ‘ choices of DT threes ’ WDT human beings are always presented with , PRP have been shown from these past weeks events WDT DT earths older peoples still VBP DT songs and did not perish in this latest cataclysm : “ Elders ' NNP Knowledge Spares Some Thais ” . PRP RB have DT examples of DT NN ’s animals knowing these songs too : ‘ Tsunami Adds to Belief in Animals ' ' Sixth Sense ' And PRP RB have from another of DT NN ’s older peoples , IN our dreams hold these songs too , if PRP but listen to them : “ His wife dreamed of floods , he built on stilts , and PRP survived Tsunami ” . DT ancient examples of DT warnings of ‘ oneness ’ show to PRP all RB IN EX is no insignificant event WDT for DT greater warning of all human beings will be made known to all , and these are three . For JJ NNS now DT Universe has been singing its song of warning to all human beings . From DT Southern Hemispheric Regions , and where PRP looks into DT great Magellanic Cloud , DT older peoples of PRP call DT Aborigines “ Slept and dreamt under DT stars . PRP took DT night stars for granted . PRP embraced DT darkness . PRP is woven into their culture through song , dance , ritual , art and myth . ” DT Greater Clouds of Magellan is a nebula located about 200,000 light NNS away and can be viewed with DT naked eye . PRP appears to be IN a slightly blurred cloud . In addition , DT Tarantula Nebula , VBN to be DT most beautiful sight in DT skies ( PRP resembles a spider ) , runs over DT Greater Clouds of Magellan , so PRP is a constellation with plenty of sights . ” PRP is written here . PRP RB carries DT name of DT Swordfish , and which I had previously written to PRP about . In a book titled “ Our Rock Who Art In Heaven , Hallowed Be Thy Name ” , written by Jacqueline Brook , PRP is written : “ DT comet [ or literally , "" swordfish "" ] associated with Hermes shines bright green with an oval shape ... ” On “ … DT brightest supernova in four centuries lit up DT southern sky … ” and began singing a song to DT NN ’s human beings . If PRP are PRP ’ll VB IN DT lies being told by DT NNS from DT nations of DT West are those born out of fear . Their fear comes from a knowing IN DT materialistic NN WDT PRP have spent thousands of NNS building , and in defiance of DT stewardship of this NN and its NNS ’s safekeeping PRP were entrusted with , is soon to be no more . While DT great and terrible armies of DT NN and DT vast and mysterious powers of DT universe gather for battle , DT peoples of DT Western Nations remain asleep and in ignorance of their soon to come deaths . In this NN today DT Western peoples are truly lost , soulless and faceless , not knowing any of DT events about to befall them . From this slumber of theirs , PRP , and JJ others of our kind , have pledged ourselves to save as JJ as can be saved , not from DT death of their human lives , but DT death of their very souls . © January 4 , 2005 , EU and NNP all rights reserved ."

Though Western NNS have relegated these rare Major Lunar Standstill events to their esoteric NN of Astrology , Russian Astro-Geologists are likewise firm in their belief IN these types of Solar System events do indeed have effects upon our NNP , and to almost all extents are catastrophic in nature . An ‘ informal ’ explanation of a Lunar Standstill event PRP can read from DT Wikipedia archives , and which says : "" At DT major lunar standstill , which takes place every 18.6 NNS , DT range of DT declination of DT Moon reaches a maximum . As a result , at high latitudes , DT Moon appears to move in just two weeks from high in DT sky to low on DT horizon . This NN appears to have had special significance for DT Bronze Age societies who built DT megalithic monuments in Britain , and PRP RB has significance for some neo -pagan religions . DT next major lunar standstill occurs in 2006 . As DT NNP spins on its axis , DT stars above PRP appear to move in circles . PRP appears to PRP as if all DT stars are fixed in a great sphere surrounding PRP . In DT same way IN PRP measure positions on DT NN using latitude and longitude , PRP measure positions of stars on this sphere in Right Ascension ( equivalent to longitude ) and Declination ( equivalent to latitude ) . If PRP stand at a place on DT NN which has latitude 50° , then DT stars directly above PRP have a declination of 50° . Unlike DT stars , DT Sun and Moon do not have a fixed declination . As DT NNP travels its annual orbit around DT Sun , with its rotational axis tilted at about 23.5° from DT axis of orbital motion ( a straight line joining a point on DT tropic of cancer DT ' opposite ' point on DT tropic of capricorn ) , DT Sun 's declination changes from +23.5° in June to - 23.5° in December . Thus , in DT Northern hemisphere , DT Sun is higher in DT sky in June , causing summer , than PRP is in December , when DT Sun is low in DT sky and is only above DT horizon for a short NN , causing winter . DT Moon RB changes in declination , but PRP does so in only a month , instead of a NN for DT Sun . So PRP might VB from a declination of +25° to - 25° in just two weeks , returning to + 25 ° two weeks later . Thus , in just CD month DT moon can move from being high in DT sky , to low on DT horizon , and back again . But , unlike DT Sun , DT maximum and minimum declination reached by DT Moon RB varies . This is because DT orbit of DT Moon 's revolution about DT NNP is inclined by about 5° to DT orbit of DT NNP 's revolution around DT Sun , and so DT maximum declination of DT Moon varies from ( 23.5° - 5° ) =18.5° to ( 23.5°+5° ) =28.5° . DT effect of this is IN at CD particular NN ( DT minor lunar standstill ) , DT Moon will VB its declination during DT month from +18.5° to - 18.5° , which is a total movement of 37° . This is not a particularly big NN , and MD not be very noticeable in DT sky . However , 9.3 NNS later , during DT major lunar standstill , DT Moon will VB its declination during DT month from +28.5° to - 28.5° , which is a total movement of 57° , and which is enough to take PRP from high in DT sky to low on DT horizon in just two weeks . "" Though DT major concerns of these NNS remain centered on DT Canadian - NNP NNPS Pacific Northwest and DT NNP NNPS NNP Madrid Fault Zone Regions an equal concern of imminent catastrophic earthquakes remains for America ’s California Region , and which a major precursor to earthquake activity is now being reported , and as PRP can read as reported by DT NBC 11 NNP Service in their article titled "" Dead Fish Mystery Perplexes Bay Area Biologists "" , and which says : "" Thousands of fish in DT Bay Area are turning up dead , and biologists still have no answers to this aquatic mystery . Over DT last couple of months , an alarming number of dead fish and sharks have been washing up on Bay Area shores . In NNP , 40 sharks were found dead . Then , just a couple of weeks ago , 1,000 sturgeon and striped bass were found floating in DT Bay and lying on shore , NBC11's Diane Dwyer reported . Biologists VBD DT phenomenon occurred between DT San Mateo Bridge and DT Dumbarton Bridge and between San Leandro and DT Hayward shore on DT East Bay . For fish and game biologist Becky Ota , DT death of so JJ fish at CD NN is perplexing . "" Well , PRP are concerned about PRP , "" Ota VBD . "" DT department 's aware of PRP . PRP 're trying to find out what DT cause is , but PRP 's been elusive . PRP 's been a mystery so far . PRP have n't been able to pinpoint PRP yet . "" These reports further VBP IN DT July 6th mass solar ejection from Sun Spot 898 was another likely indicator of an impending catastrophic event due to DT electromagnetic instability currently existing between these Regions , our Moon and DT Sun . More ominously , however , from these reports was DT July 4th ‘ Banging Earthquake ’ reported in DT NNP NNPS Pacific Northwest Region , and as PRP can read as reported by DT Peninsula Daily NNP Service in their article titled "" Fourth of July earthquake rattles region "" , and which says : "" Residents from Port Townsend to Port Angeles felt a small earthquake measuring 3.6 on DT Richter scale Tuesday afternoon , PRP reported dishes rattling , furniture moving and lamps swinging . DT quake was centered under DT Strait of Juan de Fuca almost halfway between Sequim and Victoria . DT quake , centered 27 miles below DT Strait 's seabed , occurred at 1:37 p.m. , DT University of Washington 's Department of NNP and Space Sciences reported . EX were no reports of damage or injury , but authorities VBD 10 persons in Port Townsend , 22 in Sequim and two in Port Angeles reported feeling DT shaker . ``My windows rattled , and my roof started creaking , '' VBD Gus McDonald of Port Townsend in a telephone call to DT Peninsula Daily NNP . VBD Lois Cahill of Sequim : ``No PRP really knew what was happening , PRP just shook DT dishes in kitchen . '' Peninsula Daily NNP photographer Keith Thorpe VBD DT quake jiggled his computer monitor at his Port Angeles home . Some NNS in DT greater Victoria area told CBC Radio PRP felt two tremors WDT happened about five seconds apart , accompanied by a loud bang . "" This ‘ Banging Earthquake ’ was RB felt in Canada ’s Pacific Northwest Region , and as PRP can read as reported by DT Vancouver Sun NNP Service in their article titled "" Minor earthquake rattles southern Vancouver Island "" , and which says , "" A minor earthquake measuring 3.7 on DT Richter scale rumbled through southern Vancouver Island Tuesday afternoon , bringing DT usual flurry of calls to DT Pacific Geoscience Centre and a glut of hits to its website . "" These reports further VBP IN Western NNS are now acknowledging their Russian Scientific counterparts in warning of DT likely increase of catastrophic earthquake and volcanic events due to JJ NN , and as PRP can see evidenced by DT Canadian Press NNP Service in their article titled "" NN NN MD cause earthquakes and volcanic eruptions , NNS say "" , and which says : "" So DT warnings of harsher heat waves , stronger hurricanes and rising seas fail to impress . How about volcanic eruptions in DT Arctic , or a tsunami off DT coast of Newfoundland ? DT latest scientific discipline to enter DT fray over JJ NN is geology . And DT forecasts from some quarters are dramatic - not only will DT NN shake , PRP will spit fire . A number of geologists say glacial melting due to NN NN will unleash pent - up pressures in DT NNP 's crust , causing extreme geological events such as earthquakes , tsunamis and volcanic eruptions . A cubic metre of NN weighs nearly a tonne and some glaciers are more than a kilometre thick . When DT weight is removed through melting , DT suppressed strains and stresses of DT underlying rock come to life . "" Pressures upon DT North American have likewise been increased due to DT rapid melting of DT massive Greenland NN Sheet , and as PRP can read as reported by DT Los Angeles Times NNP Service in their article titled "" Glaciers ' melt rate surprises NNS "" , and which says : "" DT Greenland NN sheet -- two miles thick and broad enough to blanket an area DT size of Mexico -- shapes DT NN 's weather , matched in influence only by Antarctica in DT Southern Hemisphere . In its heart , snow WDT fell a quarter of a million NNS ago is preserved . Should all of DT NN sheet ever thaw , DT meltwater MD raise NN level 21 feet and swamp DT NN 's coastal cities , home to a billion NNS . PRP MD cause higher tides , generate more powerful storm surges and , by altering ocean currents , drastically disrupt DT JJ NN . NN experts have started to worry IN DT icecap is disappearing in ways WDT computer models had not predicted . By all accounts , DT glaciers of Greenland are melting twice as fast as PRP were five NNS ago , even as DT NN sheets of Antarctica RB are shrinking , researchers at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and DT University of Kansas reported in February . Researchers have focused on a delicate ribbon -- DT equilibrium line , which marks DT fulcrum of frost and thaw in Greenland 's seasonal balance . DT zone rims DT icecap IN a drawstring . Summer melting , on average , offsets DT annual accumulation of snow . But across DT icecap , DT area of seasonal melting was broader last NN than in 27 NNS of record - keeping , University of Colorado NN NNS reported . In early NNP , temperatures on DT icecap some days were almost 20 degrees above normal , hovering just below freezing . By 2005 , Greenland was beginning to lose more NN volume than anyone had anticipated -- an annual loss of up to 52 cubic miles a NN -- according to more recent satellite gravity measurements released by JPL . DT volume of freshwater NN dumped into DT Atlantic Ocean has almost tripled in a decade . EX was even a period of melting in December . "" PRP have never seen DT , "" Steffen VBD . In an influential paper published in DT journal NNP , Zwally surmised IN DT NN sheets had accelerated in response to warmer temperatures , as summer meltwater lubricated DT base of DT NN sheet and allowed PRP to slide faster toward DT NN . In a way no NN had detected , DT warm NN made its way through thousands of feet of NN to DT bedrock -- in weeks , not decades or centuries . University of Texas physicist Ginny Catania pulled an NN - penetrating radar in a search pattern around DT camp , seeking evidence of any melt holes or drainage crevices WDT MD so quickly channel DT hot NN of JJ NN deep into DT NN . To her surprise , she detected a maze of tunnels , natural pipes and cracks beneath DT unblemished surface . "" I have never seen anything IN PRP , except in an area where NNS have been drilling bore holes , "" Catania VBD .

Hydrocarbons are naturally - occurring compounds and form DT basis of crude oil , natural gas , coal , and other important NN sources . Hydrocarbons are highly combustible and produce carbon dioxide , NN , and heat when PRP are burned . Therefore , hydrocarbons are highly effective as a source of fuel . Hydrocarbons occur naturally throughout DT NN , originating from plant and animal fossils WDT have been formed by DT forces of temperature and weight over millennia . PRP are mostly found deep underground , in porous rock formations ( such as sandstone , limestone , and shale ) . Porous rock formations are often found in large bodies of NN , so EX is an immense quantity of hydrocarbons trapped deep beneath DT oceans . Oil and natural gas exploration companies use advanced engineering techniques to identify these potential reservoirs and pull their resources to DT surface for human use . Examples of such technologies include offshore oil platforms , directional drilling , and enhanced oil recovery ( EOR ) techniques . Hydrocarbons are very important for DT modern economy . Globally , hydrocarbons are responsible for roughly 85 % of NN consumption . This figure MD actually understate DT role of hydrocarbons in DT economy by a significant margin because PRP are used in a wide range of applications aside from their use as a source of NN . For example , refined petroleum has been used to produce myriad derivative materials WDT play critical roles in DT JJ economy , such as plastics , solvents , and lubricants . Different techniques are used to extract hydrocarbons , depending on DT type and location of DT reserve . For example , hydraulic fracturing — better known as “ fracking ” — is used to extract natural gas from shale rock by using pressurized fracking fluid to create fissures through which DT gas can escape to DT surface . Mining is used to access oil sands , which are unconventional deposits of crude oil WDT are heavily intermixed with sand and sandstone . Unfortunately , PRP is now understood IN EX is a serious environmental cost to using hydrocarbons as a primary source of NN . Greenhouse gasses released during DT combustion of hydrocarbons are contributing to NN NN . DT process of oil and gas extraction can damage DT surface environment and surrounding groundwater of DT extraction site .

This article reviews DT observed impacts of NN NN on biodiversity and considers some perspectives for DT future at DT national level . DT following impacts are already evident for all considered taxonomic groups : elevation shifts of distribution towards mountain summits , spread of thermophilous species , colonisation by JJ species from warmer areas and phenological shifts . Additionally , in DT driest areas , increasing droughts are affecting tree survival and fish species are suffering from warm temperatures in lowland regions . These observations are coherent with model projections , and future changes will probably follow DT current trends . These changes will likely cause extinctions for alpine species ( competition , loss of habitat ) and lowland species ( temperature or drought stress ) . In DT very urbanised Swiss landscape , DT high fragmentation of DT natural ecosystems will hinder DT dispersal of JJ species towards mountains . Moreover , disruptions in species interactions caused by individual migration rates or phenological shifts are likely to have consequences for biodiversity . Conversely , DT inertia of DT ecosystems ( species longevity , restricted dispersal ) and DT local persistence of populations will probably result in lower extinction rates than expected with some models , at least in 21st century . PRP is thus very difficult to estimate DT impact of NN NN in terms of species extinctions . A greater recognition by society of DT intrinsic value of biodiversity and of its importance for our existence will be essential to put in place effective mitigation measures and to safeguard a maximum number of native species ."

Chirping from DT talus slopes of DT Teton Range in DT Rocky Mountains , DT American pika ( ) sends a warning call to intruders — in this case humans climbing up DT switchbacks in Grand Teton National Park ’s Cascade Canyon . Sounding its alarm from a rocky perch , then darting into crevices and shadow on DT steep slope , DT rodent - sized , round - eared , brownish gray pika goes largely unnoticed . But as DT second species petitioned for protection under DT U.S. Endangered Species Act ( ESA ) because of NN NN - associated threats ( DT polar bear was DT first ) , DT pika cannot afford to be overlooked for much longer . DT American pika lives primarily at elevations between 8,000 and 13,000 feet , though PRP MD be found at significantly lower elevations , including a little above NN level . Low - elevation pika populations , however , are at high risk of NN NN , particularly local NN and decreased precipitation . Populations of pika in Yosemite National Park , for example , have migrated more than 500 feet upslope over DT course of DT last century , a shift coincident with a temperature increase of 5.4 °F in Yosemite during DT same period of NN . More significantly , over DT course of only a decade — between 1999 and 2008 — pikas in DT Great Basin on DT eastern edge of DT Sierra Nevada experienced a nearly five - fold increase in extinction rate and an 11 - fold increase in DT rate of upslope retreat . Pikas EX are now moving upslope at a rate of 475 feet per decade . In 2010 , despite DT documented loss of pikas and evidence linking pika declines and range shifts with NN NN , DT U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ( FWS ) decided not to protect DT American pika under DT ESA . DT decision was denounced by DT nonprofit Centers for Biological Diversity , which had petitioned for DT species ’ protection , and was supported by some biologists , who claimed IN most populations of DT American pika are stable . Pikas , however , are highly susceptible to warm temperatures and will die within several hours of constant exposure to temperatures of 75 to 78 °F . Their survival RB appears to depend heavily on contiguous habitat . For instance , a NN of historical pika population sites in DT southern Rockies , where pika habitat extends over a large area , revealed IN just four out of 69 populations had been extirpated since DT 1980s . DT extirpations occurred at sites WDT were once wet but WDT had dried out over DT course of DT last 100 NNS . Contiguous habitat and upslope migration are DT pika ’s only hope for escape from local NN NN and drying . But at higher elevations , food MD be scarce and DT NN too cold , and given DT isolation of pika populations , PRP remains to be seen whether migration and dispersal to JJ areas can actually rescue DT species . Furthermore , several decades into DT future , DT high , mountainous elevations where pikas can now find refuge MD no longer be cool and wet enough to support their survival . Indeed , NN prediction models have suggested IN summertime temperatures in pika habitat will increase by 5.4 °F by 2050 . While DT FWS cited this figure in its report explaining why pika do not warrant protection under DT ESA , such an increase will render DT lower elevations of JJ mountain ranges , including DT Teton Range , uninhabitable for pika . And while PRP is difficult to predict precise temperature increases beyond 2050 , temperatures likely will continue to rise , forcing DT American pika higher and higher , further restricting its range and its chances of survival in DT process ."

James Watson is DT Director of DT NNP and Research Initiative at DT Wildlife Conservation Society and a professor of conservation NN at DT University of Queensland . DT opinions expressed in this commentary are their own . View more opinion at CNN . ( CNN ) DT NNP and its inhabitants face three JJ crises : DT pandemic crisis , DT NN crisis and biodiversity crisis . Unto themselves , each already feels overwhelming -- in terms of JJ - NN consequences , DT speed and scale of impacts , and DT transformative actions needed to keep DT NN habitable . CD commonality lies at DT core of these massive JJ challenges : DT destructive relationship between humanity and DT natural NN . Human activities drive these invisible enemies , and our hope for DT future will derive from solutions based on caring for nature . With NNP - CD - related mortality expected to be high in vulnerable populations , at least CD expert , NYU NN economist Gernot Wagner , has likened DT pandemic to "" NN NN at warp speed . "" DT exponential growth rate of NNP - CD makes DT pandemic far more apparent to most NNS , on a daily basis , than a NN NN . Yet DT devastating recent fires in Australia and DT loss of Pacific islands to NN - level rise remove any doubt IN NN NN is a fast - moving crisis . PRP already VBP DT links between NN NN and DT third crisis , biodiversity loss . A 2019 report from DT Intergovernmental NNP - Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services outlined DT consequences for humanity of DT rampant erosion of ecosystems across NNP . DT report highlighted clear evidence of reductions in pollination , NN regulation , soil NN and pollution regulation among a myriad of lost "" natural capital . "" PRP RB provided evidence IN intact ecosystems -- especially our vast tropical and boreal forests -- play a critical role in abating runaway NN NN . These areas soak up around 30 % of mankind 's carbon NNS each NN and will continue to provide this huge service if effectively conserved . Such natural systems RB offer humanity its best defense against NN NN by regulating local NN , for example , and reducing risks of NN - related hazards such as NN - level rise and floods . Areas of high biological diversity often RB hold a high level of viral diversity . As such , increased degradation of our NN 's intact ecosystems can pose human NN risks . NNS use DT term "" zoonosis "" to refer to infectious diseases IN NNP - CD ( caused by DT NN SARS - CoV - 2 ) WDT spread from animals to humans . DT current pandemic has been associated with a market in Wuhan , NNP , where DT flow of wild animals from forest frontiers to urban communities likely provided DT source of infection . Yet wild animals themselves do not cause DT problem . Rather , NNS continue to place increased pressures on DT NNP 's remaining biodiverse ecosystems . Activities such as DT commercial wildlife trade , logging and deforestation , and DT expansion of agriculture into previously undisturbed areas alter DT "" normal "" circulation of viruses . These changes can increase contact and exchange - rates of pathogens between wildlife and humans . In other words , as humanity encroaches further into nature , NNS have a greater chance of coming into contact with JJ pathogens carried by animals , and humanity finds itself at greater risk of pandemics IN DT NN unfolding now . DT problems of pandemics , NN and biodiversity loss are linked -- but so are DT solutions . Ending DT commercial trade of wildlife for human consumption MD drastically mitigate DT exposure , limiting DT risk of pathogens spilling over from animals to humans and causing NN outbreaks . At DT same NN , protecting ecosystems from human encroachment helps maintain biodiversity and mitigate NN NN , by maintaining plant life WDT absorbs carbon from DT atmosphere . Only a few months ago , PRP looked to 2020 as DT "" super NN "" for biodiversity and NN NN . Nations WDT signed onto international conventions on NN ( CoP 26 ) and biodiversity ( CoP 15 ) hoped to finalize JJ strategic plans looking to 2030 . With DT key NN and biodiversity meetings delayed due to DT pandemic , coordinated action remains pressing . Perhaps DT NNP - CD crisis itself MD still bring negotiators together ( in spirit if not in person ) for unified action , if DT JJ pandemic manages to rouse a sense of solidarity among NN governments . When PRP comes to reducing threats to our NN , DT NN , and biodiversity , PRP VBP IN DT tools of protecting intact forests and reducing forest degradation work well . DT NN -- and all its citizens and leaders -- must embrace natural solutions to head off these three crises . Proactively conserving and restoring our remaining intact ecosystems represents a key strategy to halt NN NN , biodiversity loss , and -- PRP must hope -- DT next pandemic . This article has been updated to clarify IN DT authors argue ending commercial wildlife trade for human consumption , specifically , MD mitigate human exposure to pathogens . PRP has RB been updated to reflect IN James Watson is a professor , not associate professor , of conservation NN at DT University of Queensland ."

DT NNP ’s surface has warmed by more than 0.8 °C over DT past century , and by approximately 0.6 °C in DT past three decades . 1 This NN has been linked to more extreme weather conditions such as intense floods and droughts , heavier and more frequent storms , and a possible increase in frequency and intensity of DT El Niño Southern Oscillation . These changes are largely caused by human activities , mainly DT burning of fossil fuels releasing carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) WDT traps heat within DT atmosphere . These CO2 NNS continue to rise , and NN models project DT average surface temperature will rise by 1.1 °C to 6.4 °C over DT 21st century . 2 Since 1990 , WHO has published a series of reports on NN NN and has participated in review processes such as DT Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP . These activities have outlined four key characteristics of DT NN risks generated by a NN and a more variable NN . First , these hazards are diverse , JJ and probably irreversible over human NN scales . PRP range from increased risks of extreme weather , such as fatal heat waves , floods and storms , to less dramatic but potentially more serious effects on infectious NN dynamics , shifts to long - term drought conditions in JJ regions , melting of glaciers WDT supply freshwater to large population centres , and NN level increases leading to salination of sources of agriculture and drinking NN . Second , DT NN impacts of NN NN are potentially huge . JJ of DT most important JJ killers are highly sensitive to climatic conditions . Malaria , diarrhoea and protein - NN malnutrition together cause more than 3 million deaths each NN . 3 Third , these risks are inequitable , in IN DT greenhouse gases WDT cause NN NN originate mainly from developed NNS , but DT NN risks are concentrated in DT poorest nations , which have contributed least to DT problem . 4 Finally , JJ of DT projected impacts on NN are avoidable , through a combination of JJ NN interventions in DT short term , support for adaptation measures in NN - related sectors such as agriculture and NN management , and a long - term strategy to reduce human impacts on NN . Threats to NN are often cited to justify actions to mitigate or adapt to NN NN ; for example , NNP Nations Secretary - General Kofi Annan ’s 2006 speech in Nairobi.5 For all DT attention WDT these issues receive , however , a comprehensive strategy to support a JJ NN response is conspicuously lacking . This strategy is urgently needed , both because DT NN community has a duty to counter emerging threats , and because increased attention to NN NN offers opportunities to focus on DT most disadvantaged populations ’ current needs . For example , DT international community has agreed on DT principle of a JJ NN NN adaptation fund , funded by a 2 % levy on a multibillion - dollar Clean Development Mechanism .6 However , this opportunity to strengthen JJ NN can be seized only if DT NN sector knows what PRP should do differently because of NN NN . DT development of a comprehensive strategy will take NN , but some essential principles are already clear . A JJ problem requires a strategy of international dimensions WDT can translate into regional and local actions . Just as NN NN ’s underlying causes are JJ , its NN implications do not respect national boundaries . Impacts in CD location , such as infectious NN epidemics or population displacements caused by droughts or rising NN levels , quickly spread across national borders . Coordinated investments in preventive measures therefore contribute to DT “ JJ JJ good ” of reducing DT risk of NN emergencies . DT challenge is simplified somewhat by DT fact IN NN NN is expected to lead mainly to changes in existing NN issues rather than to DT emergence of JJ and unfamiliar diseases . An important guiding principle therefore is to increase DT priority given to currently important NN burdens WDT are likely to be worsened by NN NN . Such a “ no regrets ” strategy will bring important JJ NN benefits under any plausible future NN conditions . Adaptation to NN NN is essentially a matter of basic JJ NN protection . DT challenges of rapid environmental , demographic and social changes all call for greater emphasis on NN prevention , providing a better balance with DT current focus on curative and reactive measures . DT necessary preventive actions to deal with most NN - sensitive diseases are already quite clear . NN NN and other environmental stresses should help to refocus political and financial commitments to implement these measures . CD emerging environmental NN threat is DT decline in JJ freshwater resources , caused mainly by increasing rates of NN extraction and contamination . NN NN is expected to worsen this decline in NN quality and quantity , particularly in already dry regions such as DT eastern Mediterranean and north Africa . Scaling up NN and sanitation services and providing point - of - use disinfection MD reduce DT current burden of NN and ameliorate DT NN impacts of decreasing NN supplies . Such interventions already have a very high cost–benefit ratio; 7 DT threat of NN NN makes these preventive NN measures an even wiser investment . As NN stresses intensify , governments MD protect NN by strengthening and enforcing their regulatory frameworks to ensure DT safe use of JJ NN sources WDT will become increasingly important : wastewater , excreta and greywater in agriculture and aquaculture . 8 Effective surveillance and response systems are essential in managing any infectious NN , but PRP become even more important under conditions of rapid NN . These conditions include climatic shifts as well as increasing rates of movement of and contact between humans , pathogens and reservoirs . These conditions all require improved human NN surveillance integrated with monitoring of NN and other environmental conditions WDT favour NN outbreaks , including NN in wildlife and agricultural animals . NN NN RB strengthens DT case for reinforcing response systems for infectious NN outbreaks , including predefined action plans and maintenance of DT control resources and personnel capacity necessary to mount effective responses . DT impacts of current and future natural disasters MD be reduced by DT NN sector defining integrated measures WDT address DT root causes of vulnerability , and planning for effective responses after such events . For example , DT NN impacts of floods can be reduced by land management policies WDT reduce deforestation and conserve DT integrity of watersheds and coastal zones , minimize DT physical impacts of mudslides and storm surges , and decrease DT chances of sewage contamination . Post - flooding NN effects can be reduced by adequately planned and funded NN - sector responses , including interventions to control outbreaks of vector - borne and NN - related diseases . Since 2000 , WHO has worked with DT NNP Meteorological Organization and DT UN Environment Programme to raise awareness of NN NN ’s implications for DT NN sectors of highly vulnerable regions . DT necessary next step is to inform and support national NN actors in taking concrete actions to protect NN . For example , WHO is addressing this need by initiating a JJ project in 2006 on piloting approaches to protect NN in changing climates .9 In partnership with DT UN Development Programme and with funding from DT NNP Environmental Facility , this initiative is being implemented in seven vulnerable NNS . In each , DT national NN ministry chairs an intersectoral team WDT has identified priority NN risks from NN NN given local environmental socioeconomic and NN contexts . Through DT course of DT initiative , this team will RB identify , implement , monitor and refine interventions to minimize NN risks . DT project will thereby support targeted interventions in these NNS , strengthen institutional capacity to address NN risks , involve an increasingly informed and engaged NN sector in adapting to NN NN , and extract lessons WDT are applicable to other NNS . PRP will RB develop monitoring mechanisms to ensure IN resources are applied effectively in adaptation projects within DT NN sector , and inform evaluations of support through this mechanism as compared with more general NN or development aid . This initiative is important preparation for DT wider action WDT will be necessary to meet DT worldwide challenge of adapting to NN risks from NN NN . DT actions described above represent “ safe investments ” for NN NN adaptation funds within DT NN sector . However , JJ climatic risks to NN lie at least partly outside DT NN sector ’s normal sphere of action . Perhaps most critically , NN NN has DT capacity to suppress agricultural yields , with DT greatest risks in Africa,10 where malnutrition is already DT largest single contributor to NN burdens . 11 Some of DT most effective actions by NN professionals MD therefore involve supporting other sectors ’ efforts to mitigate and adapt to NN NN . Much work still needs to be done in this area , including : Ultimately , however , DT JJ NN community needs to VB beyond reacting to a changing NN . A true preventive strategy needs to ensure DT maintenance and development of healthy environments from local to JJ levels . In DT long term , sustainable development and protection of ecosystem services are fundamentally necessary for human NN .13 This is not just a case of protecting future generations , as even in DT short term development choices WDT protect DT NN can benefit JJ NN significantly . DT intersection of NN , transport , NN and NN provides an example of this . DT Stern Review of DT economics of NN NN argues IN DT long - term benefits of major investments to cut greenhouse gas NNS MD vastly outweigh their costs , and IN these are needed to avoid potentially catastrophic impacts on DT JJ economy . 12 This coincides with a WHO assessment IN feasible improvements in environmental conditions MD reduce DT JJ NN burden by more than 25%.14 Much of DT current burden is due to unhealthy NN and transport services . Changing these systems to reduce NN NN MD therefore RB bring significant and largely unacknowledged JJ NN gains . Improving access to JJ and active transport MD greatly reduce CO2 NNS , while RB cutting DT 800 000 annual JJ deaths from outdoor air pollution , DT 1.2 million annual deaths from traffic accidents , and DT 1.9 million deaths from physical inactivity . 11 Changing DT poorest communities ’ domestic NN technologies MD reduce DT 1.5 million annual indoor air pollution deaths . 15 DT critical next stage for DT NN community is a more direct and assertive engagement with DT environment and JJ sectors to ensure IN NN - supporting technological and development choices are implemented . Human - induced NN NN is an emerging threat WDT rightly commands widespread policy and JJ attention . Along with other rapid changes associated with JJ population and JJ growth , NN NN strains existing weak points in NN protection systems and calls for reconsideration of JJ NN priorities . DT most effective responses are likely to be strengthening of DT key functions of environmental management , surveillance and response to safeguard NN from natural disasters and changes in infectious NN patterns , and a more pro-active approach to ensure IN development decisions serve DT ultimate goal of improving human NN .16 For DT most part these are not JJ interventions but existing tools underutilized due to DT “ true killers ” : lack of political commitment and of financial resources . 17 NN NN therefore demands IN PRP intensify our efforts in preventive JJ NN and place DT crucial task at DT core of sustainable development . ■ • Surface temperature analysis : analysis graphs and plots .

NN chief says NN leaders must recognize EX is no option except to speed - up and scale - up action to tackle JJ NN , warning IN continuing on DT current path will lead to “ a catastrophe . ” Patricia Espinosa stressed in two recent interviews with DT Associated Press IN NN NNS are saying EX ’s still a chance to make things right “ but DT window of opportunity is closing very soon ” and DT NN has 12 NNS until carbon NNS reach “ a point of no return . ” DT means DT NN needs to accelerate all efforts to keep from reaching DT level , “ and therefore all efforts are absolutely indispensable ” to cut carbon NNS and keep temperatures from rising , she VBD . Some top NNS say reaching DT “ tipping point ” in 12 NNS is an oversimplification of a U.N. report last NN . Espinosa VBD carbon NNS were expected to rise in DT immediate future after DT landmark Paris agreement was adopted in 2015 to address NN NN because DT transformations needed to VB to a downward trajectory “ cannot be done overnight . ” In addition , JJ population is growing and more NNS demand more NN and resources , she VBD . “ What has become clear , however , is IN if PRP continue to grow or to behave in a way WDT this kind of trajectory is maintained PRP will not be able to achieve DT goals of DT Paris agreement , ” VBD Espinosa , who is executive secretary of DT NNP Nations Framework Convention on NNP NNP . DT Paris agreement called for JJ temperatures to rise a maximum of 2 degrees Celsius ( 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) by DT end of DT century compared to pre-industrial times and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius ( 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ) . DT NN has already warmed 1 degree Celsius , so DT goal is really about preventing another 1 or 0.5 degrees Celsius ( 1.8 or 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit ) increase from now . A report last NN by DT Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP , or IPCC , concluded IN while PRP ’s technically possible to cap JJ NN at 1.5 degrees Celsius ( 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ) by DT end of DT century , PRP is highly unlikely because this MD require a dramatic overhaul of DT JJ economy , including a shift away from fossil fuels . Deep in DT report , NNS say less than 2 % of 529 of their calculated possible future scenarios kept VBG below DT 1.5 degree C ( 2.7 degrees F ) goal . “ What NN is showing now since Paris is IN 1.5 degrees C is really necessary because DT consequences of staying at 2 degrees C are very big , ” Espinosa VBD . “ And secondly , PRP is RB showing IN 1.5 degrees C is possible . PRP takes more effort . PRP takes much more political will . ” She VBD DT IPCC NNS gave DT NN 12 NNS “ to speed - up and scale - up DT actions ” to cut NNS before PRP start spiraling out of control . “ PRP does n’t mean IN PRP need to wait 12 NNS and then look at PRP as DT moment to do this , ” Espinosa VBD . “ PRP means IN PRP need to accelerate DT tipping point , and therefore all efforts are absolutely indispensable . ” DT U.N. report does not say 2030 , DT date used , is a last chance , hard deadline for action , as PRP has been interpreted in some quarters . DT panel “ did not say PRP have 12 NNS left to save DT NN , ” James Skea , co-chairman of DT report and professor of sustainable NN at Imperial College London , told DT Associated Press . “ DT hotter PRP gets , DT worse PRP gets , but EX is no cliff edge . ” “ This has been a persistent source of confusion , ” agreed Kristie L. Ebi , director of DT Center for NNP and DT NNP Environment at DT University of Washington in Seattle . “ DT report never VBD PRP only have 12 NNS left . ” Espinosa VBD in an interview Tuesday IN DT attention DT issue is getting “ is clearly growing ” but not “ at DT speed and DT breadth WDT PRP should . ” Governments VBP trapped in dealing with immediate needs “ and PRP are not yet in a situation where PRP can say PRP have a broad understanding IN DT threat to NN NN is part of those immediate needs , ” Espinosa VBD . She VBD communities WDT suffer destruction from DT effects of NN NN have woken up , DT movement by NNS from schools around DT NN is “ a wake - up call , ” and mass protests to combat NN NN will hopefully spur decision - makers . But Espinosa VBD some NNS say NN NN is n’t happening , “ this is not man-made , ” and “ others are just very , very indifferent to DT issue . ” “ So PRP have a lot of work to do to still to VB everybody on board , ” she VBD . “ PRP have a very long , long way to VB . ” Espinosa stressed IN DT goal is “ to VB to a moment where leaders recognize IN EX is no option . ” “ DT truth is IN if PRP continue to produce , consume , to function as PRP are doing now , PRP VBP IN PRP are VBG toward a catastrophe , ” she VBD , and DT will mean loss of lives , serious impacts on different sectors of DT economy , massive displacement and instability . Leaders must understand “ IN DT business as usual scenario is not an option anymore , ” she VBD .

NN is supposed to be reliable , based upon fact , unprejudiced , and trustworthy , is n’t PRP ? Well , VB again . A lot of what passes for NN these days is utter nonsense , pseudo - NN ( i.e. , false NN ) , and a lot of scientific fact is hidden from JJ view because PRP ’s not politically correct . PRP is absurdly comical what is commonly mislabeled as “ NN ” these days . DT “ Discovery ” channel recently produced a laughable documentary on Greenland 's alleged “ melting glaciers . ” Oh boy ! Here PRP VBP again with JJ NN . PRP 's really a comedy . A team was flown in by helicopter to actually install special plastic covers over a 2 - acre area to reflect DT sun ’s rays and help prevent DT glacier from melting . PRP spent 3 - days in 60 M.P.H. gusts of frigid wind , in chill factors well below zero , with millions of dollars worth of equipment and materials , to cover a mere 2 - acres of DT glacier . DT ’s IN covering CD grain of sand on DT biggest beach in DT NN . PRP VBD PRP MD cost $ 186,000,000,000 just to cover a small fraction of Greenland ’s glaciers to combat DT effects of JJ NN . Their major concern was IN such a project MD RB require 21,000,000 helicopter trips , which MD dump enormous amounts of Carbon Dioxide ( i.e. greenhouse gases ) into DT atmosphere . DT whole idea of preventing a glacier from melting is insane ! If indeed DT NN ’s glaciers are melting , attempting to stop them from melting by covering them with reflective material MD n’t work . According to JJ NN proponents DT NN ’s temperature is increasing . So what good MD PRP do to cover DT glaciers ? DT sun ’s rays are not DT problem . This just shows DT fallacy of JJ NN . CD minute PRP claim IN DT NN ’s temperature is rising , and then PRP set out to protect Greenland ’s glaciers from DT sun ’s rays . Well , which is PRP , DT sun ’s rays or DT higher temperatures on NN ? If , as JJ NN proponents claim , DT NN ’s temperatures are rising , then protecting glaciers from DT sun ’s rays is a complete waste of NN and money . I ’ve been reading about a “ JJ NN tax ” for some NN now and I VBP this is DT ultimate goal of all this scare - mongering … an international JJ NN tax ! If PRP VBP DT truth behind any agenda … follow DT money . PRP 's just a matter of NN . Our taxes should n't be wasted on junk NN . PRP VBP , why did n’t PRP hear about JJ NN 30 - NNS ago ? Has NN NN changed RB much in just a few decades ? No ! CD violent volcanic eruption emits more gases and pollution into DT NN ’s atmosphere than all DT cars and industries in America combined in just a single NN . DT sun itself generates enough radiation to penetrate DT NN ’s crust and maintain a molten core of lava . Who ’s kidding who ? How did mankind survive for Millenniums without combating DT NNP NNP boogie man ? Even DT founder of DT Weather channel and a lifelong meteorologist , John Coleman , has candidly stated publicly IN JJ NN is a big scam . I ’ve quoted DT entire article here because PRP ’s something WDT everyone needs to read … PRP is DT greatest scam in history . I am amazed , appalled and highly offended by PRP . JJ NN ; PRP is a SCAM . Some dastardly NNS with environmental and political motives manipulated long term scientific data back in DT late 1990's to create an allusion of rapid JJ NN . Other NNS of DT same environmental wacko type jumped into DT circle to support and broaden DT "" research "" to further enhance DT totally slanted , bogus JJ NN claims . Their friends in NN steered huge research grants their way to keep DT movement VBG . Soon PRP claimed to be a consensus . Environmental extremist , notable politicians among them then teamed up with movie , NN and other liberal , environmentalist journalists to create this wild "" scientific "" scenario of DT civilization threatening environmental consequences from JJ NN unless PRP adhere to their radical agenda . Now their ridicules manipulated NN has been accepted as fact and become a cornerstone issue for CNN , CBS , NBC , DT Democratic Political Party , DT Governor of California , school teachers and , in JJ NNS , well informed but very gullible environmental conscientious citizens . Only CD reporter at ABC has been allowed to counter DT NNP NNP frenzy with CD 15 minutes documentary segment . I do not oppose environmentalism . I do not oppose DT political positions of either party . However , NNP NNP , i.e. NNP NNP , is not about environmentalism or politics . PRP is not a religion . PRP is not something PRP "" believe in . "" PRP is NN ; DT NN of meteorology . This is my field of life - long expertise . And I am telling PRP JJ NN is a nonevent , a manufactured crisis and a total scam . I say this knowing PRP probably wo n't believe me , a mere TV weatherman , challenging a Nobel Prize , Academy Award and Emmy Award winning former Vice NNP of NNP NNPS . So be PRP . I suspect PRP might VB to say to me , "" John , look DT research WDT supports DT case for JJ NN was done by research NNS ; NNS with PH D's in Meteorology . PRP are employed by major universities and important research institutions . Their work has been reviewed by other NNS with PH D's . PRP have to VB a lot more about PRP than PRP do . Come on , John , VB with PRP . DT experts say our pollution has created an strong and increasing greenhouse effect and a rapid , out of control JJ NN is underway WDT will sky rocket temperatures , destroy agriculture , melt DT NN caps , flood DT coastlines and end life as PRP VBP PRP . How can PRP dissent from this crisis ? PRP must be a bit nutty . Allow me , please , to explain how I VBP this all came about . Our universities have become somewhat isolated from DT rest of PRP . EX is a culture and attitudes and values and pressures on campus WDT are very different . I VBP this group well . My father and my older brother were both PHD - University types . I was raised in DT university culture . Any person who spends a decade at a university obtaining a PHD in Meteorology and become a research scientist , more likely than not , becomes a part of DT single minded culture . PRP all look askance at DT rest of PRP , certain of their superiority . PRP respect NN and disrespect business , particularly big business . PRP are environmentalists above all else . And , EX is something else . These NNS VBP IN if PRP do research and results are in no way alarming , their research will gather dust on DT shelf and their research careers will languish . But if PRP do research DT sounds alarms , PRP will become well known and respected and receive scholarly awards and , very importantly , more research dollars will come flooding their way . So when these researchers did NN NN studies in DT late 90's PRP were eager to produce findings WDT MD be important and be widely noticed and trigger more research funding . PRP was easy for them to manipulate DT data to come up with DT results PRP wanted to make headlines and at DT same NN drive their environmental agendas . Then their JJ minded PHD colleagues reviewed their work and hastened to endorse PRP without question . EX were a few who did n't fit DT mold . PRP did ask questions and raised objections . PRP did research with contradictory results . DT environmental elitists berated them brushed their studies aside . I have learned since DT NNP Age is coming scare in DT 1970's to always be a skeptic about research . In DT case of JJ NN , I did n't accept NN accounts . Instead I read dozens of DT scientific papers . I have talked with numerous NNS . I have studied . I have thought about PRP . I VBP I am correct when I assure PRP EX is no run away NN NN . DT impact of humans on NN is not catastrophic . Our NN is not in peril . PRP is all a scam , DT result of bad NN . I am not alone in this assessment . EX are hundreds of other meteorologists , JJ of them PH D's , who are as certain as I am IN this JJ NN frenzy is based on bad NN and is not valid . I am incensed by DT incredible NN glamour , DT politically correct silliness and rude dismal of counter arguments by DT high priest of NNP NNP . In NN , a decade or two , DT outrageous scam will be obvious . As DT temperature rises , polar NN cap melting , coastal flooding and super storm pattern all fail to occur as predicted everyone will come to realize PRP have been duped . DT sky is not falling . And , natural cycles and drifts in NN are as much if not more responsible for any NN changes underway . I strongly believe IN DT next twenty NNS are equally as likely to see a cooling trend as PRP are to see a VBG trend . NN has been politicized — not by DT Right ; but by DT Left , which sees JJ NN , Darwinism , stem cell research , and innumerable other issues as tools to advance its agenda ( and in JJ NNS expand DT reach of NN ) . When liberals parade out NNS with white coats , debate is supposed to be silenced . But JJ of DT high priests of NN have something to hide — from blind intolerance of Biblical claims to greedy guarding of their federally financed research budgets . What a waste of tax - payer money ! "" NNP "" means "" DT NN of "" something . Therefore , to qualify as legitimate NN , EX MUST be something to VB . Evolution is a perfect example of FALSE NN . EX is nothing to VB in evolution . Evolution CANNOT be studied ! PRP CANNOT be tested ? PRP CANNOT be monitored or examined ? In fact , all available scientific evidence shows IN evolution is NOT true in DT least . In DT same manner , NNP NNP is bad NN , i.e. , EX are NO solid scientific research findings to support their doomsday scenario . DT “ evidence ” at best is far - fetched and purely circumstantial . I remember hearing Al Gore claim several NNS back IN massive flooding in NNP was caused by JJ NN . Such alleged “ evidence ” of JJ NN is ridiculous . Suspiciously , Gore and other JJ NN proponents have remained silent concerning record - breaking cold temperatures in recent NNS . For example : In 2007 NNP York City set an all - NN low record of 59 degrees for DT month of August . In January of 2004 , Boston 's Logan International Airport recorded a low of 3 below zero , two degrees chillier than DT previous record for January 10 , set in 1875 . PRP was DT city 's coldest day since January 16 , 1994 , when thermometers registered 4 below . Meanwhile , on DT day in NNP York City , Al Gore was giving a speech about DT effects of JJ NN ! In 2007 , Chicago experienced DT 6th coldest February on record since 1871 and DT coldest February in nearly three decades . JJ NN ? PRP decide ! Historical NN records clearly evidence IN EX are normal “ cycles ” of short - term and long - term weather patterns . Thus such terms as “ El Nino ” ( warmer ) and “ La Nina ” ( cooler ) are used to identify DT normal temperature NN patterns in DT ocean . PRP is sad IN JJ NNS are gullible enough to believe JJ NN exists simply because someone shows them a video of NN flowing from a glacier . I remember as a kid seeing snow melting on DT rooftop of DT house and draining into DT guitars , even though PRP was close to zero degrees outside . I noticed IN big icicles dripped from DT heat of sun , even though PRP was only 10 degrees outside . So why should PRP be surprising IN NN should flow from a glacier when DT sun shines upon PRP ? PRP is normal . I saw a bumper sticker DT other day which read ... "" I believe DT Big Bang Theory ... God spoke and BANG , PRP happened . "" I thought DT was pretty good , and PRP is certainly Biblical . PRP is far more reasonable to believe DT Bible ; than PRP is to believe DT hocus - pocus nonsense of a bunch of whacko NNS . Just as Evolution , NNP NNP is a scam — a cleverly devised invention of greedy and dishonest NNS ."

PRP say IN because DT NN wo n’t exist when PRP retire ( because of NN NN ) EX ’s no need to save any money . But if PRP apply DT logic to everything , EX is never a need to prepare for DT future of anything and DT liberal ideology crumbles upon itself . Market Watch used a young professional as an example of this flawed thinking . Lori Rodriguez , a 27 - NN - old communications professional in NNP York City , is not saving for retirement , and PRP is n’t necessarily because she can’t afford to , but because she does n’t expect PRP to matter . IN JJ NNS her age , Rodriguez has bought into DT propaganda and religiously believes IN NN NN will have catastrophic effects on our NN . Some 88 % of millennials ( a higher percentage than any other age group ) believe in DT NN NN religion and 69 % say PRP will impact them in their lifetimes . “ I VBP to hope for DT best and plan for a future WDT is stable and secure , but , when I look at current events and at DT NN PRP are predicting , I do not see how things MD not be chaotic in 50 NNS , ” Rodriguez says . Author and real estate entrepreneur Stefan Aarnio joins Owen Shroyer live via Skype to discuss his book “ Hard Times Create Strong Men ” and reveal how to be an alpha male in DT age of toxic feminism . “ DT weather systems are already off , and I do n’t VB PRP ’s hyperbolic to be a little apocalyptic . ” DT mainstream NN is n’t helping either . Using manipulation techniques , DT NN engulfs NNS in a constant barrage of depressing and hate - filled NN stories . So much so , IN JJ young NNS are skeptical about saving for a future PRP are constantly being told wo n’t exist . Just to clarify for these younger NNS , in 2008 liberal hero Al Gore predicted IN EX MD be no polar NN caps in three to five NNS because of JJ NN . However , DT “ inconvenient truth ” is IN DT NN caps are still RB today ( over ten NNS later ) . Interestingly enough , right after stating IN younger Americans do n’t save for retirement because PRP believe NN NN will destroy DT NN , Market Watchclarified IN mental NN MD be an issue . Jean Twenge , who authored DT NN cited by Market Watch , says this spike in mental NN issues MD be attributed to DT increased use of digital NN . Technology has changed modes of indoctrination just enough to impact social lives and communication . Millennials are RB VBN to suffer from “ eco-anxiety , ” according to a 2018 report from DT American Psychological Association , with 72 % saying their emotional well - being is affected by DT inevitability of NN NN , compared with just 57 % of NNS over DT age of 45 . Two - thirds of millennials ( defined by Pew as DT generation born between 1981 and 1996 ) have nothing saved for retirement , according to DT National Institute on Retirement Security . And now PRP VBP why some are n’t saving . DT religion of NN NN has a death grip on their mental stability . PRP is n’t IN PRP do n’t VB to take DT NN . Those who do n’t subscribe to DT NN NN religion of hysteria simply believe IN NNS should care for DT NNP DT best way PRP can . Putting DT NNP ’s salvation in DT hands of a few bureaucrats is n’t VBG to solve anything . After all , NN officials can’t even clean up a trash pile in DT Democrat ’s paradise of Los Angeles . If NN NN was really a problem , EX ’s no way authoritarians MD solve PRP nor MD PRP VB too . EX ’s just too much money to be made off DT gullible masses . Some NNS just VBP to watch DT NN burn .

These rising temperatures threaten CD of DT largest long - term stores of carbon on land : permafrost . Permafrost is permanently frozen soil . DT generally cold temperatures in DT Arctic keep soils RB frozen NN - on - NN . Plants grow in DT uppermost soil layers during DT short summers and then decay into soil , which freezes when DT winter snow arrives . Over thousands of NNS , carbon has built up in these frozen soils , and PRP ’re now estimated to contain twice DT carbon currently in DT atmosphere . Some of this carbon is more than 50,000 NNS old , which means DT plants WDT decomposed to produce DT soil grew over 50,000 NNS ago . These soil deposits are known as “ Yedoma ” , which are mainly found in DT East Siberian Arctic , but RB in parts of Alaska and Canada . As DT region warms , DT permafrost is thawing , and this frozen carbon is being released to DT atmosphere as carbon dioxide and methane . Methane release is particularly worrying , as PRP ’s a highly potent greenhouse gas . But a recent NN suggested IN DT release of methane from ancient carbon sources – sometimes referred to as DT Arctic methane “ bomb ” – did n’t contribute much to DT NN WDT occurred during DT last deglaciation – DT period after DT last NN age . This occurred 18,000 to 8,000 NNS ago , a period WDT NN NNS VBP intently , as PRP ’s DT last NN JJ temperatures rose by 4°C , which is roughly what is predicted for DT NN by 2100 . This NN suggested to JJ IN ancient methane NNS are not something PRP should be worried about this century . But in JJ research , PRP found IN this optimism MD be misplaced . Read more : DT Arctic is turning brown because of weird weather – and PRP MD accelerate NN NN PRP went to DT East Siberian Arctic to compare DT age of different forms of carbon found in DT ponds , rivers and lakes . These waters thaw during DT summer and leak greenhouse gases from DT surrounding permafrost . PRP measured DT age of DT carbon dioxide , methane and organic matter found in these waters using radiocarbon dating and found IN most of DT carbon released to DT atmosphere was overwhelmingly “ young ” . Where EX was intense permafrost thaw , PRP found IN DT oldest methane was 4,800 NNS old , and DT oldest carbon dioxide was 6,000 NNS old . But over this vast Arctic landscape , DT carbon released was mainly from young plant organic matter . This means IN DT carbon produced by plants growing during each summer growing season is rapidly released over DT next few summers . This rapid turnover releases much more carbon than DT thaw of older permafrost , even where severe thaw is occurring . So what does this mean for future NN NN ? PRP means IN carbon NNS from a NN Arctic MD not be driven by DT thawing of an ancient frozen carbon bomb , as PRP ’s often described . Instead , most NNS MD be relatively JJ carbon WDT is produced by plants WDT grew fairly recently . What this shows is IN DT age of DT carbon released from DT NN Arctic is less important than DT amount and form PRP takes . Methane is 34 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas over a 100 - NN timeframe . DT East Siberian Arctic is a generally flat and wet landscape , and these are conditions which produce lots of methane , as EX ’s less oxygen in soils which might otherwise create carbon dioxide during thaws instead . As a result , potent methane MD well dominate DT greenhouse gas NNS from DT region . Since most of DT NNS from DT Arctic this century will likely be from “ young ” carbon , PRP MD not need to worry about ancient permafrost adding substantially to modern NN NN . But DT Arctic will still be a huge source of carbon NNS , as carbon WDT was soil or plant matter only a few hundred NNS ago leaches to DT atmosphere . DT will increase as warmer temperatures lengthen growing seasons in DT Arctic summer . DT fading spectre of an ancient methane NN bomb is cold comfort . DT JJ research should urge DT NN to act boldly on NN NN , to limit how much natural processes in DT Arctic can contribute to DT problem ."

Speaking calmly and with a wry smile , Thunberg acknowledged IN her campaign which began with school strikes had attracted huge attention without yet achieving NN . “ EX is a difference between being heard to actually leading to something , ” she VBD . “ I am not DT person who should complain about not being heard , ” she VBD to appreciative laughter . “ I am being heard all DT NN . But DT NN and DT voice of DT young NNS are not at DT centre of DT conversation , ” she added . DT forum ’s own JJ Risks report published last week warned IN “ NN NN is striking harder and more rapidly than JJ expected ” with JJ temperatures on track to increase by at least three degrees Celsius ( 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit ) towards DT end of DT century . EX are no expectations IN NNP and Thunberg , who have exchanged barbs through Twitter , will actually meet , but DT crowded venue and intense schedule mean a chance encounter cannot be ruled out . When NNP and his entourage walked through UN headquarters last NN at DT annual General Assembly , a photo of DT teenager staring in apparent fury at DT NN from DT sidelines went viral . Tweeting as he headed to Davos , NNP appeared in bullish mood , writing he MD “ bring Good Policy and additional Hundreds of Billions of Dollars back to DT NNP NNPS of America ! ” “ PRP are now NUMBER CD in DT Universe , by FAR !! he added . Sustainability is DT buzzword at DT forum , which began in 1971 , with heel crampons handed out to participants to encourage them to walk on DT icy streets rather than use cars , and DT signage paint made out of seaweed . NNP ’s opposition to renewable NN , his withdrawal from DT Paris NN accord negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama , and DT free hand extended to DT fossil fuel industry puts him at odds with DT entire thrust of DT event . Business leaders attending DT forum will be keen to tout their awareness on NN NN but are likely RB to be concerned by DT NN of DT JJ economy whose prospects , according to DT IMF , have improved but remain brittle . DT IMF cut its JJ growth estimate for 2020 to 3.3 percent , saying IN a recent truce in DT trade war between NNP and DT NNP had brought some stability but IN risks remained . “ PRP are already seeing some tentative signs of stabilisation but PRP have not reached a turning point yet , ” VBD IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva . Activists meanwhile will be pressing for much more concrete action to fight inequality , after Oxfam issued a report outlining how DT number of billionaires has doubled in DT past decade and DT NN ’s 22 richest men now have more wealth than all DT women in Africa . Greenpeace meanwhile complained IN some of DT NN ’s biggest banks , insurers and pension funds have collectively invested $ 1.4 trillion in fossil fuel companies since DT Paris NN deal . Other key priorities will be exploring how to battle biodiversity loss , narrow DT digital divide between DT internet haves and have nots and step up DT fight against pandemics in DT face of NN hesitancy and drug resistance . “ I am angry about DT NN of DT NN but I am RB determined to engage and provide solutions and deliver , ” WWF director general Marco Lambertini told AFP . “ EX needs to be healthy balance between these two sentiments . ”"

Follow_VB Waking_NNP Times_NNP on_IN Twitter_NNP ._.","Mainstream Scientist Exposes DT Dangerous Reality of Chemtrails and Geoengineering Over DT past few NNS , DT issue of geoengineering has been popularized . Mainstream NN , academia , and NN almost unanimously support DT idea of geoengineering as a perceived solution to NN NN while suppressing DT evidence IN PRP has actually been in use for some NN without our consent . On DT other hand , EX is a growing number of NNS who are slowly beginning to understand DT reality surrounding chemtrail geoengineering , and opposition is slowly growing . In a bold move against DT establishment , Kate Marvel , a mainstream scientist who specializes in “ NN NN , ” spoke out at a Ted Talk against DT onset of NN engineering with chemtrails , RB known as Solar Radiation Management or “ SRM . ” Firstly , computer theorist and founding partner of tech company Applied Invention , Danny Hillis , came on stage and proposed a number of geoengineering concepts which MD theoretically , “ turn down DT temperature of DT NN . ” These included sending giant parasols into space , putting fizzy NN into DT ocean , and sending chalk into DT atmosphere at a rate of 10 teragrams per NN to reflect sunlight and in theory slow DT effects of NN NN . Now enters Kate Marvel with DT opening line , “ Danny , PRP seem so nice , and I hope PRP can be friends , and PRP terrify me . ” Marvel RB noted IN atmospheric spraying MD not do anything to effect other environmental problems such as ocean acidification . GeoEngineering refers to technologies which are used with DT intention of interfering with DT NN ’s atmosphere in order to alter temperatures and NN . Most of these technologies are still in theoretical stages , however a growing body of evidence suggests IN some weather modification technologies such as aerosol spraying or “ cloud seeding ” have been in production for JJ decades . Almost no studies have been done which assess DT effect WDT cloud seeding has on environmental safety or human NN , which shows IN DT NN has been using untested technologies on DT population without our consent . In 2016 , CIA Director John O. Brennan spoke at a Council on Foreign Relations conference about DT benefits of geoengineering . However , any mention of potential negative impacts as a result of cloud seeding was conveniently left out . Although PRP are all hearing from establishment figures IN Brennan IN NN engineering is a JJ technology which PRP all have DT option to accept or decline before PRP is implemented , DT is simply not DT case . Evidence VBG as far back as DT early 1920 ’s shows a push to develop DT technology needed to control DT weather and has been implemented in some form since at least DT 1970’s . This information has been uncovered in various forms , CD of those being patents which range from April 27th of 1920 to NNP of 2003 showing interest in DT development of various forms of weather modification technologies . Documents have RB been uncovered which show NN involvement in SRM since 1947 . NN NN Alarmism Opens DT Door To Reactionary Solutions Such As SRM DT geoengineering debate can be summed up in three words : “ Problem , Reaction , Solution . ” First , DT dire problem of NNP NNP is presented by figures IN Al Gore , then a reaction is generated from DT NN in DT form of “ NN Ca n’t Wait ! ” slogans and JJ unrest , then DT solution of GeoEngineering is presented which gives more power to DT powerful and hurts DT NNS in DT form of environmental degradation and potential NN implications which DT document from earlier lists as : “ 1. Cloud seeding has been responsible for DT great 5 - NN drought in DT Northeast NNP NNPS . 2 . Isolated sections in DT Northeast have experienced 18 NNS of drought due to cloud seeding . 3 . Weather disturbances in DT South Atlantic [ sic ] have been eliminated and has reduced [ sic ] DT east coast ’s rainfall by 30 percent – rain WDT is needed if agriculture is to be successful . 4 . DT average dairy farmer on DT east coast , living in an area of cloud seeding , has averaged a net financial loss because of cloud seeding . 5 . Crop production losses in Franklin County , Pa. , alone have amounted to $ 50 Million . 6 . When effects of seeding wear off , cloudbursts occur , causing floods , destroying crops , buildings , and drowning NNS as well as livestock . 7 . Seeding has been responsible for DT serious air pollution problems . 8 . Mental retardation and insanity are traceable to cloud seeding chemicals . 9 . Poisoning of all living matter is directly related to cloud seeding . 10 . Emphysema is three times higher in areas of heavy cloud seeding . 11 . Cancer is virulently out of proportion . 12 . Financial losses to agriculture and related industries run into DT billions . 13 . Forest trees as well as cultivated orchards are dying from chemical reactions taking place in DT air due to DT addition of cloud seeding agents . ” PRP often hear predictions surrounding NN NN by so - called “ experts ” IN Al Gore who claimed IN DT Arctic MD become “ NN - free ” by 2013 . Ironically , in 2016 a JJ NN expedition to DT Arctic was forced to turn around due to record NN . EX are real solutions to environmental problems which do n’t end up harming PRP or DT environment further . PRP is NN for NNS to stand up for themselves and reject dangerous and untested technologies IN these . Phillip Schneider is a student and a staff writer for Waking Times .

PRP have to now look at DT JJ strength of our nation , ” she says . In 2018 , Dominica passed DT NNP Resilience Act , which fully came into effect on DT first day of 2019 , and in a budget address delivered last July DT prime minister highlighted how far DT country had come . DT economy has grown by 9 percent . Tourism is on DT rise . All schools are open . A JJ NN - of - DT - art hospital welcomed patients in August . Five hundred JJ homes have been built and more than 1,000 are under construction . DT NN expects banana production to return to pre-Maria levels , and , to ensure food security , distributed seeds to farmers for other staple crops IN dasheen , yams , potatoes , and passion fruit , which are are sold locally . PRP ’s Easter weekend in Scott ’s Head , and DT sky is free of clouds . DT ocean laps DT shore with meditative regularity ; DT wind barely moves . PRP ’s difficult to imagine DT chaos WDT ripped this neighbourhood to shreds and left DT island so destroyed IN PRP was repeatedly described as a war zone . Jelviel , whose home was rammed by a boat during DT hurricane , shows me her house , now mostly rebuilt . DT NN assisted her with two windows and a door , but DT 64 - NN - old mostly credits her neighbours with helping restore her home . DT community in Scott ’s Head is tightly knit , she says , and PRP took care of each other after DT storm .

During DT Late Cretaceous , DT continents were moving and major JJ mountain chains began to rise . JJ of DT shallow Mesozoic seas dried up . Van Valen and Sloan suggest IN this caused DT NN 's NN to VB . Evidence from fossil plants at their Montana NN site suggests IN PRP got about ten centigrade points colder in DT Late Cretaceous . A temperature decline WDT large MD affect DT NN . PRP MD have become colder in DT mountains , and JJ plants MD have replaced DT warm - weather plants . Van Valen and Sloan have argued IN dinosaurs were at a disadvantage in DT JJ forests of coniferous trees . So , PRP left DT mountains and moved toward DT tropics , to a better NN . This theory suggests IN DT dinosaurs survived longer in DT tropics than in DT mountains . Because plants in DT tropics survived , something else must have caused dinosaur extinction in these areas . CD suggestion is IN placental mammals ( mammals WDT give live birth and have a placenta ) became abundant in DT mountains , because PRP no longer competed with dinosaurs . Later , DT mammals escaped these regions and went into DT tropics , where PRP drove dinosaurs to extinction . EX are problems with this theory . Some studies of foraminifera ( DT shells of protozoans talked about earlier ) show IN EX was a short - term NN trend in DT Late Cretaceous . But PRP are right about DT long - term cooling trend . EX is no evidence IN dinosaurs lasted longer in CD area than another . Although competition between animals MD explain DT extinction of JJ living things at DT end of DT Cretaceous , other groups , especially DT foraminifera , seem to have disappeared without competitors . Another NN NN theory is due to recent research . Some living reptiles , turtles and crocodiles , lay eggs . PRP was recently found IN DT sex of their offspring is decided by DT temperature of DT nest . So if DT same were true for dinosaurs , cooling temperatures in DT Late Cretaceous MD have caused all DT young to be of DT same sex , so DT species MD not have been able to continue ."

Frazier is an NN reporter for DT Allegheny Front , a Pittsburgh - based JJ NN outlet covering DT environment in Pennsylvania . His work has aired on NPR and Marketplace . If PRP ’ve been following NN NN , DT NN pandemic will feel oddly familiar these days . NNS , including DT U.S. , have implemented radical policies WDT MD have been unthinkable a few weeks ago to slow DT spread of DT NN . Is this what PRP will take to solve DT NN crisis ? On DT latest episode of our NNP on NNP podcast , CD NN reporter and writer says DT NN pandemic ca n’t be separated from DT coming NN crisis . Last NN Emily Atkin launched DT HEATED newsletter which , in her words , is for NNS who are pissed off about NN NN . Atkin has now turned Heated into a podcast series about DT intersection of NN NN and NN . PRP ’s running on DT podcast feed for Drilled ( another NN - related podcast PRP should be listening to ) . She spoke with CD of DT NNP on NNP podcast host , DT Allegheny Front ’s Reid Frazier . Reid Frazier : Tell me about DT podcast series and why PRP decided to do PRP . Emily Atkin : I was sitting here watching this JJ crisis take over society , politics and our lives . And I was confused about how I should be approaching PRP as a NN journalist . I knew EX were clear parallels : PRP ’s a problem WDT threatens millions of lives across DT NN . NNS are telling PRP to act very rapidly and quickly , and yet PRP ’re not doing DT . I wanted to talk to really smart NNS about DT . I figured I might as well record [ those conversations ] and make PRP available for other NNS to listen to so IN PRP MD all figure PRP out together . RF : If PRP ’ve followed NN NN PRP VBP IN this is a massive problem WDT requires collective action on an unprecedented scale . EX ’s a lot of resistance built - in ; resistance to changing our behaviors and our systems . How do PRP see those problems as similar ? Do PRP see big differences in how these problems manifest themselves or how PRP need to be looked at ? EA : I VBP DT differences are good to VB out of DT way first . NN is obviously hugely different in IN PRP is much faster and DT impacts to human life are much more urgent . I VBP PRP ’re all VBG to see NNS close to PRP either financially affected or affected in their NN . This is touching every aspect of our lives very obviously right now , whereas NN NN is touching every aspect of our life right now , too , but PRP ’s a little less obvious day - to - day . DT other thing is IN with NN , PRP do n’t have as big of an industry whose whole livelihood depends on DT crisis keeping VBG . DT pharmaceutical industry will be fine NN or not . DT fossil fuel industry will not be fine if PRP solve NN NN because EX will be no fossil fuel industry . But DT big similarities here are IN NN NN is a problem WDT wo n’t be solved unless PRP take really radical action very quickly on a JJ scale . PRP ca n’t be done without DT biggest nations on NNP . PRP ’s a problem where millions of lives are threatened ; not only lives , but society in general . PRP ’s a problem where PRP have to listen to NNS . EX are no compromises based on biology or physics . Carbon dioxide warms DT atmosphere . If PRP VBP DT atmosphere to stop NN , PRP need to reduce DT amount of carbon dioxide . Just DT same , NN is a NN WDT attacks ourselves and DT ’s why PRP need to stay away from each other . PRP ’s basic NN and physics . EX are RB some social similarities : a reluctance to admit to DT scale of DT problem as PRP VBP PRP . I VBP PRP saw DT with NN , where PRP all knew PRP was happening , but PRP were RP , ‘ but PRP ’s not VBG to affect me and I do n’t really have to do anything . ’ NN is basically just NN NN sped up 10 times over . PRP ’s IN NN NN on steroids . RF : As PRP mentioned , EX ’s this resistance to listening to what DT NNS are telling PRP . With NN NN , PRP can basically VB away with DT for NNS . DT is IN DT terrible thing about NN NN – DT ramifications of our actions ( or inaction wo n’t be felt until DT next generation . But , with NN , PRP ’s UH three weeks . EA : EX ’s plausible deniability , too . When PRP comes to NN NN , deaths are happening now . Someone PRP love MD be really affected by a hurricane or drought or a flooding event or heatwave . But EX ’s some part of your brain WDT PRP MD compartmentalize and say IN PRP was n’t NN NN . PRP ’s not IN NN where if PRP die from NN , PRP die from NN . I VBP DT ’s an important distinction to make when PRP ’re talking about who is VBG to be affected by NN NN . PRP ’s not IN NNS are VBG to see DT effects down DT line ; PRP ’s IN NNS are VBG to start admitting to themselves IN these are DT effects down DT line . PRP ’ve all focused our attention on this CD thing . But NN NN has n’t stopped . PRP ’s still happening and our efforts to combat PRP have just slowed . DT fossil fuel industry is trying to take advantage of DT crisis and make sure PRP can survive when this is done . These are all things WDT PRP need to keep in mind as PRP ’re self - isolating and trying to deal with this crisis . PRP ’s not IN PRP ’ve replaced CD crisis for DT other , PRP ’s DT now PRP have two to deal with . RF : EX ’s been an effort from environmental groups and some in DT Democratic Party to infuse any recovery package with green policies , almost VB to kickstart a Green NNP Deal . What have PRP made of DT debate about whether any recovery package should incentivize decarbonization or ramp up renewables ? EA : PRP does n’t seem unrelated to me . If society were gonna VB where PRP wanted PRP to VB anyway , which is where PRP do n’t die from four degrees Celsius of NN , PRP need a mass investment in green jobs . DT ’s not just renewable NN jobs , DT ’s things IN planting mangrove trees and restoring ecosystems . So if PRP ’re VBG to put two trillion dollars in revitalizing DT economy , why not create an economy WDT is more resilient to JJ threats , especially as PRP ’re facing a JJ threat ? RB , if PRP had DT opportunity to spend trillions of dollars revitalizing DT economy and in DT process MD not only save millions of lives from NN , but MD save millions of lives from NN NN , creating a better society WDT ’s more sustainable , why MD n’t PRP do DT ? RF : I VBP for a lot of NNS , PRP ’re just not used to NN telling PRP things WDT PRP can and ca n’t do in this country –closing restaurants , telling NNS to stay home–all these things WDT a month ago MD have been unthinkable . Do PRP see a shift in DT way PRP see NN or DT things WDT become allowable because of this crisis ? I mean , if PRP ’re straight up just giving Americans twelve hundred dollars to just survive and giving industries hundreds of billions of dollars to survive , will a Green JJ Deal , or something IN PRP , become more politically acceptable ? EA : Americans ’ ability to forget things WDT have happened and keep up with DT status quo is very strong . However , what I MD hope comes out of this situation in terms of changing our way of thinking is IN PRP understand DT difference between sacrifices PRP make while PRP still have NN to prevent a problem and sacrifices PRP make when PRP were in DT thick of a problem . If PRP ’re VBG to solve NN NN , PRP will have to make sacrifices . DT policies WDT PRP put in place now to prevent crises later are VBG to mean IN some things are VBG to be weird and uncomfortable and take getting used to PRP . PRP ’s VBG to radically VB DT costs of certain foods , how much PRP use JJ transportation , how much our taxes are . PRP ’s VBG to be uncomfortable and PRP ’s gonna suck , but PRP ’s way less uncomfortable than DT changes WDT NN NN MD force PRP to make in DT moment . I ’ve been covering NN NN for long enough to VB IN if PRP reach three degrees Celsius , DT NN is VBG to look awful . DT things WDT PRP ’re VBG to have to do to try and reverse DT in real - NN are not VBG to be pretty . So let ’s make these sacrifices now so IN PRP all have a better chance of survival when PRP ’re a little bit down DT line ."

According to DT Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP , Africa is among DT most vulnerable continents to NN NN . [ 1] [ 2 ] DT vulnerability of Africa to NN NN is driven by a range of factors WDT includes weak adaptive capacity , high dependence on ecosystem goods for livelihoods , and less developed agricultural production systems . [ 3 ] DT risks of NN NN on agricultural production , food security , NN resources and ecosystem services will likely have increasingly severe consequences on lives and sustainable development prospects in Africa . [ 4 ] Managing this risk requires integration of mitigation and adaptation strategies in DT management of ecosystem goods and services , and DT agriculture production systems in Africa . [ 5 ] Over DT coming decades , NN from NN NN is expected across almost all DT NN 's surface , and JJ mean rainfall will increase . [ 6 ] Regional effects on rainfall in DT tropics are expected to be much more spatially variable and DT sign of NN at any CD location is often less certain , although changes are expected . Consistent with this , observed surface temperatures have generally increased over Africa since DT late 19th century to DT early 21st century by about 1 °C , but locally as much as 3 °C for minimum temperature in DT Sahel at DT end of DT dry season . [ 7 ] Observed precipitation trends indicate spatial and temporal discrepancies as expected . [ 8 ] [ 2 ] DT observed changes in temperature and precipitation vary regionally . [ 9 ] [ 8 ] In terms of adaptation efforts , regional - level actors are making some progress . This includes DT development and adoption of several regional NN NN adaptation strategies [ 10 ] e.g. SADC Policy Paper NNP NNP , [ 11 ] and DT adaptation strategy for DT NN sector . [ 12 ] In addition , EX has been other efforts to enhance NN NN adaptation , such as DT tripatite Programme on NN NN Adaptation and Mitigation in Eastern and Southern Africa ( COMESA-EAC-SADC ) . [ 13 ] As a supranational organisation of 55 member NNS , DT African Union has put forward 47 goals and corresponding actions in a 2014 draft report [ 14 ] to combat and mitigate NN NN on DT continent . DT Secretary General of DT NNP Nations has RB declared a need for close cooperation with DT African Union in order to tackle NN NN , in accordance with DT UN 's sustainable development goals . NN NN will increasingly impact Africa due to JJ factors . These impacts are already being felt and will increase in magnitude if action is not taken to reduce JJ carbon NNS . DT impacts include higher temperatures , drought , changing rainfall patterns and increased NN variability . These conditions have a bearing on NN production and consumption . DT recent drought in JJ African NNS , which has been linked to NN NN , adversely affected both NN security and JJ growth across DT continent . Agriculture is inherently sensitive to NN conditions and is CD of DT most vulnerable sectors to DT risks and impacts of JJ NN NN . [ 17 ] Agriculture in most African NNS is mainly small - scale and rain - fed , making PRP particularly vulnerable to NN variability and NN . Observed and projected disruptions in precipitation patterns due to NN NN are likely to shorten growing seasons and affect crop yield in JJ parts of Africa . Furthermore , DT agriculture sector in Africa is dominated by smallholder farmers with limited access to technology and DT resources to adapt . [ 18 ] NN variability and NN have been and continue to be , DT principal source of fluctuations in JJ food production in NNS of DT developing NN where production is highly rain - dependent . [ CD ] DT agriculture sector is sensitive to NN variability , [ 20 ] especially DT inter-annual variability of precipitation , temperature patterns , and extreme weather events ( droughts and floods ) . These climatic events are predicted to increase in DT future and are expected to have significant consequences to DT agriculture sector . [ 21 ] This MD have a negative influence on food prices , food security , and land - use decisions . [ 22 ] Yields from rainfed agriculture in some African NNS MD be reduced by up to 50 % by 2020 . [ 21 ] In order to prevent DT future destructive impact of NN variability on food production , PRP is crucial to adjust or suggest possible policies to cope with increased NN variability . African NNS need to build a national legal framework to manage food resources in accordance with DT anticipated NN variability . However , before devising a policy to cope with DT impacts of NN variability , especially to DT agriculture sector , PRP is critical to have a clear understanding of how NN variability affects different food crops . In DT NN 2020 , sever invasion of Locusts harmed DT agriculture in eastern Africa . DT invasion is at least partly due to NN NN - DT warmer temperature and heavier rainfall caused an abnormal increase in DT number of locusts [ 23 ] NN quality and availability have deteriorated in most areas of Africa particularly due to NN NN . Previous research and NN projections provide enough evidence IN NN resources are vulnerable and have DT possibility of being strongly impacted by NN NN with vast ramifications on human societies . [ 24 ] DT IPCC predicts millions of NNS in Africa will persistently face increased NN stress due to NN variability and NN ( IPCC 2013 ) . Changes in precipitation patterns directly affect surface runoff and NN availability . [ 25 ] Any changes to DT hydrological cycle MD have significant effects on river basins of Africa . To improve understanding of past and future changes in NN availability due to NN NN , DT IPCC ( IPCC 2013 ) recommends using DT dynamic downscaling technique . DT IPCC 2013 proposed using DT coordinated regional downscaling experiment ( CORDEX ) regional NN models which runs at a maximum of 50 km resolutions , DT resolution used depends upon DT size of DT watershed and area coverage by DT meteorological records . However , before using DT NN simulations from DT dynamic downscaling , PRP is appropriate to evaluate their performance at different spatial scales since their performance differs from CD location to another and from CD RCM to another . African NNS have DT least efficient JJ NN systems in DT NN . [ 26 ] Infectious NN burdens such as malaria , schistosomiasis , dengue fever , meningitis , which are sensitive to NN impacts , are highest in DT sub-Saharan African region . For instance , over 90 percent of annual JJ malaria NNS are in Africa . [ 26 ] Changes in NN will affect DT spread of infectious agents as well as alter NNS ’s disposition to these infections . With increasing population and corresponding NN demand , NN security must be addressed because NN is crucial for sustainable development . NN NN has affected NN sectors in Africa as JJ NNS depend on hydropower generation . Decreasing rainfall levels and droughts have resulted in lower NN levels in dams with adverse impacts on hydropower generation . This has resulted in low electrical NN production , high cost of electricity and power outages or load - shedding in some African NNS WDT depend on hydroelectric power generation . Disruptions in hydropower generation have negatively affected various sectors in NNS such as Ghana , Uganda , Kenya , Tanzania . Central Africa , for DT most part , is landlocked and is geographically threatened by NN NN . Due to its high NN variability and rainfed agriculture , Central Africa is expected to experience longer and more frequent heatwaves as well as an increase in wet extremes . [ 27 ] DT JJ mean temperature in this region is to increase by 1.5 °C to 2 °C . [ 28 ] Angola - "" DT objective of DT National Adaptation Programs of Action are to identify and communicate DT urgent and immediate needs of DT country regarding NN NN adaptation , to increase Angola ‘s resilience to NN variabilities and to NN NN to ensure achievement of Poverty reduction programs , sustainable development objectives and DT Millennium Development Goals pursued by DT NNP . "" [ 29 ] DT carbon dioxide - absorbing capacity of forests in DT Congo Basin have decreased . This decrease has occurred due to increasing heat and drought causing decreased tree growth . This suggests IN even unlogged forests are being affected by NN NN . A Nature NN indicates IN by 2030 , DT African jungle will absorb 14 percent less carbon dioxide than PRP did from around 2005 - 2010 , and will absorb none at all by 2035 . [ 30 ] Situated almost entirely in DT tropics , rainfall in Eastern Africa is dominated by DT seasonal migration of DT tropical - rain band . [ 31 ] Eastern Africa is characterized by high spatio - temporal rainfall variability as PRP spans over 30 degrees of latitude ( across DT equator ) . PRP has influences from both DT Indian and Atlantic Oceans , and has major orographic features ( highlands ) as well as inland NN bodies such as Lake Victoria . Therefore DT rainfall seasonality varies from a single wet season per NN in July –August in parts of DT northwest ( including Ethiopia and South Sudan , which are meteorologically more connected to West Africa , with DT West African monsoon bringing DT rains ) to a single wet season per NN in December - February in DT south ( over Tanzania ) , with JJ areas close to DT equator having two rainy seasons per NN , [ 32 ] approximately in March–May ( DT “ Long Rains ” ) and October to December ( DT “ Short Rains ” ) . Fine - scale variability in rainfall seasonality is often linked to orography and lakes . Inter - annual variability can be large and known controls include variations in NN surface temperatures ( SSTs ) of different ocean basins , large - scale atmospheric modes of variability such as DT Madden - Julian Osciliation ( MJO ) [ 33 ] [ 34 ] and tropical cyclones . [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Eastern Africa has witnessed frequent and severe droughts in recent decades , as well as devastating floods . Trends in rainfall since DT 1980s show a general decrease in March - NNP ( MAM ) seasonal rains with a slight increase during June - September ( JJAS ) and October - December ( OND ) rains , [ 36 ] although EX appears to have been a recent recovery in DT MAM rains . [ 37 ] In DT future , both rainfall and temperature are projected to VB over Eastern Africa . [ 38 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Recent studies on NN projections suggest IN average temperature might increase by about 2 - 3 °C by DT middle of DT century and 2 - 5 °C at DT end of DT century . [ 41 ] This will depend on emission scenarios as well as on how DT real NN responds compared with DT range of possible outcomes shown by models . NN model projections tend to show an increase in rainfall , particularly during OND season , which is RB projected to occur later . This delay in DT short rain season , has been linked to DT deepening of DT Saharan Heat Low under NN NN . [ 42 ] PRP should be noted , however IN some models predict decreasing rainfall , [ 40 ] [ 41 ] and for some regions and seasons DT very largest rainfall increases predicted have been shown to involve implausible mechanisms due to systematic model errors . [ 43 ] In addition , changes of aerosols provide a forcing of rainfall NN WDT is not captured in JJ assessments of NN projections . [ 44 ] [ 45 ] DT contrast of DT drying trend of MAM ( long rains ) rainfall in equatorial Eastern Africa , with most models predicting a wetting in DT future has been labelled DT “ East African NN NN paradox , "" [ 45 ] although EX has been some recent recovery in DT rainfall . [ 37 ] Studies have shown IN DT drying trend is unlikely to be purely natural , but MD be driven by factors such as aerosols rather than greenhouse gases , [ 45 ] further research is needed . DT drying has been shown to be have been caused by a shorter rainy season , and linked to deepening of DT Arabian Heat Low . [ 37 ] Consistent with DT uncertainty in rainfall projections , changes in rainy seasons onset are uncertain in equatorial Eastern Africa , although JJ models predict a later and wetter short rains . [ 42 ] DT Indian Ocean Dipole ( IOD ) is known to provide a strong control on inter-annual variability in DT short rains , [ 46 ] and studies show IN extreme IODs MD increase under NN NN . [ 47 ] Globally , NN NN is expected to lead to intensification of rainfall , as extreme rainfall increases at a faster rate with NN than total rainfall does . [ 6 ] Recent work shows IN across Africa JJ models are expected to under -estimate DT rate of NN of this rainfall intensification , [ 48 ] and changes in rainfall extremes MD be much more widespread than those predicted by JJ models . [ 49 ] Southern parts of Eastern Africa receive most of their rainfall in a single rainy season during DT southern hemisphere ’s winter : over Tanzania seasonal rainfall is projected to increase under future NN NN , although EX is uncertainty . [ 42 ] Further south , over Mozambique , a shorter season due to a later onset is projected under future NN NN , again with some uncertainty . [ 50 ] Comoros - "" NAPA is DT operational extension of DT Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper ( PRSP ) , as PRP includes among its adaptation priorities , agriculture , fishing , NN , housing , NN , but RB tourism , in an indirect way , through DT reconstitution of basin slopes and DT fight against soils erosion , and therefore DT protection of reefs by limiting DT silting up by terrigenous contributions . [ 51 ] "" Kenya gazetted DT NNP NNP Act , 2016 which establishes an authority to oversee development , management , implementation and regulation of mechanisms to enhance NN NN resilience and low carbon development for sustainable development , by DT National and County Governments , DT private sector , civil society , and other actors . Kenya has RB developed DT National NNP NNP Action Plan ( NCCAP 2018 - 2022 ) which aims to further DT country 's development goals by providing mechanisms and measures to achieve low carbon NN - resilient development in a manner WDT prioritizes adaptation . Madagascar - DT priority sectors for adaptation are : agriculture and livestock , forestry , JJ NN , NN resources and coastal zones . [ 52 ] Malawi - DT NAPA identifies DT following as high priority activities for adaptation : "" Improving community resilience to NN NN through DT development of sustainable rural livelihoods , Restoring forests in DT Upper and Lower Shire Valleys catchments to reduce siltation and associated NN flow problems , Improving agricultural production under erratic rains and changing climatic conditions , Improving Malawi ’s preparedness to cope with droughts and floods , and Improving NN monitoring to enhance Malawi ’s early warning capability and decision making and sustainable utilization of Lake Malawi and lakeshore areas resources [ 53 ] "" .

[ 56 ] DT country has RB developed sector based policies on adaptation to NN NN such as DT Vision 2020 , DT National Environmental Policy and DT Agricultural Policy among others . [ 57 ] Tanzania Tanzania has outlined priority adaptation measures in their NAPA , and various national sector strategies and research outputs . [ 58 ] DT NAPA has been successful at encouraging NN NN mainstreaming into sector policies in Tanzania ; however , DT cross-sectoral collaboration crucial to implementing adaptation strategies remains limited due to institutional challenges such as power imbalances , budget constraints and an ingrained sectoral approach . [ 59 ] Most of DT projects in Tanzania concern agriculture and NN resource management ( irrigation , NN saving , rainwater collection ) ; however , NN and tourism RB play an important role .

[ 62 ] "" Lesotho - "" DT key objectives of DT NAPA process entail : identification of communities and livelihoods most vulnerable to NN NN , generating a list of activities WDT MD form a core of DT national adaptation program of action , and to communicate DT country ’s immediate and urgent needs and priorities for building capacity for adaptation to NN NN [ 63 ] "" Namibia - DT critical themes for adaptation are "" Food security and sustainable biological resource base , Sustainable NN resources base , Human NN and well being and Infrastructure development [ 64 ] "" South Africa is in DT progress of finalizing its national NN NN adaptation strategy . "" DT National Adaptation strategy acts as a common reference point for NN NN adaptation efforts in South Africa , and PRP provides a platform upon which national NN NN adaptation objectives for DT country can be articulated so as to provide overarching guidance to all sectors of DT economy [ 65 ] "" DT West African region can be divided into four climatic sub-regions namely DT Guinea Coast , Soudano - Sahel , Sahel ( extending eastward to DT Ethiopian border ) and DT Sahara , [ 66 ] each with different climatic conditions . DT seasonal cycle of rainfall is mainly driven by DT south - north movement of DT Inter - Tropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) which is characterised by DT confluence between moist southwesterly monsoon winds and DT dry northeasterly Harmattan . [ 67 ] Based on DT inter -annual rainfall variability , three main climatic periods have been observed over DT Sahel : DT wet period from 1950 to DT early 1960s followed by a dry period from 1972 to 1990 and then DT period from 1991 onwards which has seen a partial rainfall recovery . [ 68 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] During DT dry period , DT Sahel experienced a number of particularly severe drought events , with devastating effects . [ 71 ] [ 72 ] DT recent decades , have RB witnessed a moderate increment in annual rainfall since DT beginning of 1990s . However , total annual rainfall remains significantly below DT observed during DT 1950s . [ 73 ] [ 71 ] Some have identified DT recent 2 decades as a recovery period . [ 74 ] Others refer to this as a period of ‘ hydrological intensification ’ with much of DT annual rainfall increase coming from more severe rain events and sometimes flooding rather than more frequent rainfall , or similarly other works [ 75 ] [ 76 ] underline DT continuity of DT drought even though DT rainfall has increased . Since 1985 , 54 percent of DT population has been affected by five or more floods in DT 17 Sahel region NNS . [ 77 ] In 2012 , severe drought conditions in DT Sahel were reported . Governments in DT region responded quickly , launching strategies to address DT issue . [ 78 ] DT region is projected to experience changes in rainfall regime , with NN models suggesting IN decreases in wet season rainfall are more likely in DT western Sahel , and increases more likely in DT central to east Sahel , although opposite trends can not yet be ruled out . [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] These trends will affect DT frequency and severity of floods , droughts , desertification , sand and dust storms , desert locust plagues and NN shortages . [ 82 ] [ 83 ] However , irrespective of DT changes in seasonal mean rain , DT most intense storms are expected to become more intense , amplifying flood frequency . [ 84 ] [ 85 ] Enhanced carbon NNS and JJ NN MD RB lead to an increase in dry spells especially across DT Guinea Coast associated with a reduction of DT wet spells under both 1.5 ℃ and 2 ℃ JJ NN level . [ 86 ] Fifteen percent of Sahel region population has RB experienced a temperature increase of more than 1 °C from 1970 to 2010 . DT Sahel region , in particular , will experience higher average temperatures over DT course of DT 21st century and changes in rainfall patterns , according to DT Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) . NN NN , and resulting in increased temperatures , storms , droughts , and rising NN levels , will affect DT incidence and distribution of infectious NN across DT globe . [ 87 ] This is true in Africa , where malaria continues to have dramatic effects on DT population . As NN NN continues , DT specific areas likely to experience DT NN - round , high - risk transmission of malaria will shift from coastal West Africa to an area between DT Democratic Republic of DT Congo and Uganda , known as DT African Highlands . [ 88 ] To understand DT exposures WDT affect shifting malaria transmission rates PRP can look to DT Epidemiologic Triad , a model WDT explains DT relationship between exposure , transmission , and causation of infectious diseases . [ 89 ] With regards to malaria transmission rates in DT African Highlands , factors and exposures resulting from drastic environmental changes IN warmer climates , shifts in weather patterns , and increases in human impact such as deforestation , provide appropriate conditions for malaria transmission between carrier and host . [ 90 ] Because of this , vectors will adapt , thrive , and multiply at a fast pace . An increase in DT number of vectors WDT carry parasites , microbes , and pathogens WDT cause NN will become a NN hazard for DT human population . [ 87 ] Specifically , malaria is caused by DT Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax parasites which are carried by DT vector Anopheles mosquito . Even though DT Plasmodium vivax parasite can survive in lower temperatures , DT Plasmodium falciparum parasite will only survive and replicate in DT mosquito when NN temperatures are above 20 ℃ . [ 91 ] Increases in humidity and rain RB contribute to DT replication and survival of this infectious agent . , [ 92 ] Increasing JJ temperatures combined with changes in land cover as a result of extreme deforestation will create ideal habitats for mosquitoes to survive in DT African Highlands . If deforestation continues at its current rate , more land will be available for mosquito breeding grounds , and DT population of mosquitos will rapidly increase . DT increase in mosquitoes will thus increase DT opportunity for both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax parasites to proliferate . Exposure to malaria will become a greater risk to humans as DT number of female Anopheles mosquitos infected with either DT Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax parasite increases . [ 92 ] DT mosquito will transmit DT parasite to DT human host through a bite , resulting in infection . Then , when an uninfected mosquito bites DT now infected human host , DT parasite will be transmitted to DT mosquitoes which will then become an exposure to other uninfected human hosts . Individuals who are constantly exposed to DT Malaria parasite due to multiple bites by mosquitoes WDT carry DT parasite are at greater risk of dying . [ 91 ] Infected humans can RB transmit DT NN to uninfected or healthy humans via contaminated blood . [ 91 ] DT NN effects caused by shifts in malaria transmission rates in DT African Highlands have DT potential to be severe . Research has shown IN DT effects of NN NN on NN will impact most populations over DT next few decades . [ 93 ] However , Africa , and specifically DT African Highlands , are susceptible to being particularly negatively affected . In 2010 , 91 % of DT JJ burden due to malaria deaths occurred in Africa . Several spatiotemporal models have been studied to assess DT potential effect of projected NN scenarios on malaria transmission in Africa . A NN conducted by Caminade et al . [ 94 ] concluded IN DT most significant NN NN effects are confined to specific regions , including DT African Highlands . These results are consistent with previous studies . Ultimately , studies show an overall increase in NN suitability for malaria transmission resulting in an increase in DT population at risk of contracting DT NN . [ 94 ] Of significant importance is DT increase of epidemic potential at higher altitudes ( IN DT African Highlands ) . Rising temperatures in these areas have DT potential to VB normally non-malarial areas to areas with seasonal epidemics . [ 95 ] Consequently , JJ populations will be exposed to DT NN resulting in healthy NNS lost . In addition , DT NN burden MD be more detrimental to areas WDT lack DT ability and resources to effectively respond to such challenges and stresses . [ 96 ] Scientific limitations when examining shifting malaria transmission rates in DT African Highlands are similar to those related to broader understandings of NN NN and malaria . While modeling with temperature changes shows IN EX is a relationship between an increase in temperature and an increase in malaria transmission , limitations still exist . Future population shifts WDT affect population density , as well as changes in DT behavior of mosquitos , can affect transmission rates and are limiting factors in determining DT future risk of malaria outbreaks , which RB affect planning for correct outbreak response preparation . [ 88 ] DT challenges of controlling and possibly eradicating malaria in DT African Highlands are JJ and varied . JJ of DT strategies used to control malaria have not changed , are few in number and have rarely been added to in DT last 20 NNS . DT most common forms of control are educating DT NN and vector control . DT huge geographic area of DT vectors Anopheles is possibly DT largest challenge faced in DT control of malaria . With such a large area to cover PRP is hard to use insecticides at a continuous and effective level . [ 97 ] This form of control is expensive , and DT areas affected are not able to sustain control . Without sustained control , a rapid resurgence in parasite transmission is seen . Another challenge with insecticides is IN DT vector is now becoming insecticide - resistant . Due to DT fact IN mosquitoes have several generations per NN , resistance is seen very quickly . [ 97 ] Education has its limitations as well , as DT population most affected by malaria are NNS , and DT educational message is to stay inside during peak mosquito activity . DT low socioeconomic status of DT NNS who inhabit DT African Highlands is RB a challenge . Local NN facilities have limited resources , and poor living conditions and malnourishment exacerbate malaria symptoms and increase DT likelihood of death due to malaria . [ 97 ] As NN NN shifts geographic areas of transmission to DT African Highlands , DT challenge will be to find and control DT vector in areas WDT have not seen PRP before , and to not waste resources on areas where DT temperature is no longer conducive to parasite growth . [ 98 ] DT solutions WDT can help malaria control and possibly lead to eradication are far fewer in number than DT challenges , but if PRP are effective PRP can truly VB DT areas currently affected . EX are number of groups working on a NN , some are looking to control DT transmission of DT parasite to DT host , or control transmission from human back to DT vector . [ 99 ] These NNS are not very effective currently , and lose their effectiveness over NN , so are not ideal . But , DT development is still progressing in DT hopes of finding a better , more effective long - lasting NN . [ 99 ] An alternative to NNS is vectored immunoprophylaxis ( VIP ) WDT is a form a gene therapy . This therapy will VB cells in DT host WDT will secrete antigens from various stages of DT parasite in DT hopes of triggering an anamnestic immune response in DT recipient and prevent NN and parasite transmission . [ 100 ] DT policy implications of NN NN and malaria rates in DT African Highlands are RB vast , and ultimately fall into two categories : • Enacting policy WDT will reduce greenhouse gas NNS , thus slowing down NN NN , and • Mitigating problems WDT have already arisen , and will inevitably continue to develop , due to NN NN . [ 101 ] Addressing both of these areas is of great importance , as those in DT poorest NNS , including NNS WDT make up DT African Highlands , face DT greatest burden . Additionally , when NNS are forced to contend with a NN IN malaria , their prospects for JJ growth are slowed . This contributes to continued and worsening JJ inequality . [ 102 ] When addressing policy WDT will reduce greenhouse gas NNS , PRP is necessary to act on a JJ scale , even when related effects are narrowed to a smaller area . DT 2015 Lancet Commission on NNP and NNP NNP made nine recommendations for governments to address . These include : • Support cities WDT encourage healthy activities for individuals and DT NN . • Increase access to renewable NN in low to middle - income NNS . • Quantify avoided burdens when these measures are taken . • Create an agreement WDT will help counties making changes to become low - carbon economies . [ 101 ] When PRP focuses on mitigation , specifically as PRP relates to malaria in DT African Highlands , research is still an important component . This research needs to take JJ forms , including attribution studies , to help clarify DT degree to which malaria rates are attributed to NN NN ; scenario modeling , which can help further our understanding of future NN NN consequences on malaria rates ; and examinations of intervention programs and techniques , to help our understanding of what appropriate responses are . [ 102 ] Surveillance and monitoring of malaria in populations in DT African Highlands will RB be important , to better understand NN . [ 101 ] Beyond these research priorities , PRP is RB important IN PRP enact policies WDT will significantly increase investments in JJ NN in DT African Highlands . This achieves two goals , DT first being better outcomes related to malaria in DT affected area , and DT second being an overall better NN environment for populations . [ 101 ] PRP is RB important to focus on “ CD - NN approaches . "" [ 101 ] This means collaborating on an interdisciplinary level , across various geographic areas , to come up with workable solutions . These policies can be seen in action in DT NNP NNP Organization 's “ Adaptation to NNP NNP in Africa Plan of Action for DT NNP Sector 2012 - 2016 . "" [ 103 ] This report “ is intended to provide a comprehensive and evidence - based coordinated response of DT NN sector to NN NN adaptation needs of African NNS in order to support DT commitments and priorities of African governments . "" [ 103 ] DT action plan includes goals IN scaling up JJ NN activities , coordinating efforts on an international scale , strengthening partnerships and collaborative efforts , and promoting research on both DT effects of NN NN as well as effective measures taken in local communities to mitigate NN NN consequences .

However , EX are still large gaps in understanding and characterising NN impacts in Europe and how impacts in DT rest of DT NN MD affect Europe . This report provides quantitative modelling - based results from biophysical and agro-economic models as part of DT PESETA - IV ( Projection of JJ impacts of NN NN in Sectors of DT European Union based on bottom - up Analysis ) project . PRP analyse NN NN projections for 2050 considering DT Representative Concentration Pathway ( RCP ) of 8.5 W/m2 ( with corresponding JJ NN levels ranging between 1.6 oC and 2.7 oC compared to pre-industrial levels ) , as well as for 1.5 °C and 2 °C NN conditions . Results show IN NN NN will pose a threat to JJ food production in DT medium to long term , and IN Europe will RB be affected . Forced by DT projected changes in daily temperature , precipitation , wind , relative humidity , and JJ radiation , grain maize yields in DT EU will decline between 1 % and 22 % . In addition , wheat yields in Southern Europe are expected to decrease by up to 49 % . However , in Northern Europe some of DT negative productivity effects caused by NN NN MD be partially offset by higher levels of atmospheric CO2 concentrations and changing precipitation regimes . Losses , especially in Southern Europe MD be reduced by tailored adaptation strategies ; e.g. changing varieties and crop types , increasing and improving irrigation practices for certain crops and when economically feasible . However , limitations on sustainable NN abstraction levels MD become a barrier to increase irrigation levels , specifically in DT Mediterranean NNS ( particularly Spain , Portugal , Greece , Cyprus , Malta , Italy and Turkey ) where duration of NN scarcity under JJ NN are projected to intensify . As large negative NN NN impacts on productivity outside of DT EU are estimated , large market spill - over effects will push up production in both Northern and Southern Europe through higher demand for some agricultural commodities outside of EU , resulting in higher producer prices . This , in turn , MD benefit farmers ' income and have positive effects on DT EU ’s agricultural commodity exports . However , other limiting factors ( not all fully integrated into DT used modelling system yet ) , such as increasing NN shortage in Southern Europe ( Task 10 ) and constraints on DT expansion of irrigation , increasing impacts of heatwaves and droughts , consequences of reduction of nutrient use due to environmental and NN mitigation constraints , need to be further evaluated ."

EX ’s a top - level oceanographer and meteorologist who is prepared to cry “ Nonsense ! ” on DT “ JJ NN crisis ” evident to NN modellers but not in DT real NN . He ’s as well or better qualified than DT modellers he criticises — DT ones whose NN 2100 forebodings of 4degC NN have set DT NN to spending $ US1.5 trillion a NN to combat CO2 NNS . DT iconoclast is Dr. Mototaka Nakamura . In June he put out a small book in Japanese on “ DT sorry NN of NN NN ” . PRP ’s titled Confessions of a NN scientist : DT JJ NN hypothesis is an unproven hypothesis , and he is very much qualified to take a stand . From 1990 to 2014 he worked on cloud dynamics and forces mixing atmospheric and ocean flows on medium to planetary scales . His bases were MIT ( for a Doctor of NNP in meteorology ) , Georgia Institute of Technology , Goddard Space Flight Centre , Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Duke and Hawaii Universities and DT Japan Agency for Marine - NNP NNP and Technology . He ’s published about 20 NN papers on fluid dynamics . [ i ] Today ’s vast panoply of “ JJ NN NN ” is IN an upside down pyramid built on DT work of a few score of serious NN modellers . PRP claim to have demonstrated human - derived CO2 NNS as DT cause of recent JJ NN and project IN NN forward . Every orthodox NN researcher takes such output from DT modellers ’ black boxes as a given . Dr. Nakamura has just made his work available to DT English - speaking NN : And DT critique he offers is comprehensive . Now Nakamura has found PRP again , further accusing DT orthodox NNS of “ data falsification ” by adjusting previous temperature data to increase apparent NN “ DT JJ surface mean temperature - NN data no longer have any scientific value and are nothing except a propaganda tool to DT NN , ” he writes . DT NN models are useful tools for academic studies , he says . However , “ DT models just become useless pieces of junk or worse ( worse in a sense IN PRP can produce gravely misleading output ) when PRP are used for NN forecasting . ” DT reason : These models completely lack some critically important NN processes and feedbacks , and represent some other critically important NN processes and feedbacks in grossly distorted manners to DT extent WDT makes these models totally useless for any meaningful NN prediction . I myself used to use NN simulation models for scientific studies , not for predictions , and learned about their problems and limitations in DT process . NN forecasting is simply impossible , if only because future changes in solar NN output are unknowable . As to DT impacts of human - caused CO2 , PRP ca n’t be judged “ with DT knowledge and technology PRP currently possess . ” # A complete lack of meaningful representations of aerosol changes WDT generate clouds . # Lack of understanding of drivers of NN - albedo ( reflectivity ) feedbacks : “ Without a reasonably accurate representation , PRP is impossible to make any meaningful predictions of NN variations and changes in DT middle and high latitudes and thus DT entire NN . ” # Arbitrary “ tunings ” ( fudges ) of key parameters WDT are not understood Concerning CO2 changes he says , I VBP to point out a simple fact IN PRP is impossible to correctly predict even DT sense or direction of a NN of a system when DT prediction tool lacks and / or grossly distorts important non-linear processes , feedbacks in particular , WDT are present in DT actual system … … DT real or realistically - simulated NN system is far more complex than an absurdly simple system simulated by DT toys WDT have been used for NN predictions to date , and will be insurmountably difficult for those naïve NN researchers who have zero or very limited understanding of geophysical fluid dynamics . I understand geophysical fluid dynamics just a little , but enough to realize IN DT dynamics of DT atmosphere and oceans are absolutely critical facets of DT NN system if PRP hopes to ever make any meaningful prediction of NN variation . Solar input , absurdly , is modelled as a “ never changing quantity ” . He says , “ PRP has only been several decades since PRP acquired an ability to accurately monitor DT incoming solar NN . In these several decades only , PRP has varied by CD to two watts per square metre . Is PRP reasonable to assume IN PRP will not vary any more than DT in DT next hundred NNS or longer for forecasting purposes ? I MD say , No . ” EX is much , much more . Read DT whole thing . But who are PRP VBG to believe : a superbly qualified Japanese scientist or a Swedish teenager with mental issues ?"

This plan — to kill off a significant portion of DT population — is being sold to DT NN as being for "" DT greater good of mankind "" .

"" — Frederick Henry Osborn , 1937 ; Popular eugenicist , founding member of DT American Eugenics Society , selected by Franklin Roosevelt to chair DT Civilian Advisory Committee on Selective Service in 1940 . Why are America 's NNS being taught lies which cause them to accept DT systematic poisoning of all life in NNP ? Is PRP because powerful proponents of JJ depopulation serve in DT most powerful political positions in DT NN ? Have n't PRP seen this before ? Do PRP really VB to see PRP again ? How these questions are answered is entirely up to PRP . This textbook is being used to teach NNS IN chemical aerosols are harmless NN vapor "" condensation trails "" , but this is blatantly false . Jet engines do not produce condensation trails except under extremely rare conditions , and these will be too short and too high to be seen from DT group . In fact , most NNS will never see a true condensation trail in their entire lives . JJ skywatchers and airline pilots have come forward to express their disdain about DT blatant disinformation being told to DT NN regarding contrail formation . Below is an excerpt from DT school textbook entitled "" Weather Studies "" . PRP have provided photos and a transcript of chapter 7 which is entitled "" Clouds , Prescription , and Weather Radar "" . A familiar sight in DT daytime sky almost anywhere is contrails , bright white streamers of NN crystals WDT form in DT exhaust of jet aircraft ( Figure 7.1 ) . Contrails are modifying DT cloud cover along heavily traveled air corridors between major urban areas with possible implications for weather and NN . According to some studies , contrails already cover about 5 % of DT sky in some portions of DT eastern NNP NNPS . A contrail , short for condensation trail , develops when DT hot humid air in jet engine exhaust mixes with DT cold , drier air at high altitudes . Turbulence in DT exhaust causes DT mixing . A similar process enables PRP to “ see our breath ” when PRP exhale on a cold winter day . For details on this process , see this chapter ’s first Essay , “ Clouds by Mixing . ” Depending on atmospheric conditions , contrails MD dissipate ( sublimate ) within minutes or hours , or PRP MD spread laterally forming wispy cirrus clouds WDT persist for a day or so . Atmospheric NNS hypothesized IN increased cloud cover caused by contrails MD effect DT local radiation budget in two ways : During daylight hours , contrails and their cirrus byproducts incoming solar radiation thereby cooling NNP ’s surface . At night , contrails and associated cirrus clouds absorb and emit infrared radiation welling up from below thereby enhancing DT greenhouse effect and elevating NNP ’s surface temperature . Cooler days and warmer nights reduces DT diurnal temperature range ( DTR ) , DT difference between DT day ’s maximum and minimum temperatures . Furthermore , contrails MD stimulate precipitation locally by supplying NN crystal nuclei for lower clouds . NNS had an opportunity to test their hypothesis regarding DT impact of contrails on DT radiation budget immediately after DT terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 when DT Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) ordered a three - day shutdown of all commercial air traffic in DT NNP NNPS . Almost immediately , contrails began to dissipate . David J. Travis , a NN scientist at DT University of Wisconsin - Whitewater , and colleagues at Pennsylvania NNP University analyzed DT effects of a contrail - free sky on surface temperatures at 4,000 U.S. weather stations . PRP found IN DT DTR during DT three - day period was about 1.1 - Celsius degree ( 2 Fahrenheit degrees ) higher than DT long - term ( 30 - NN ) average . Furthermore , DT DTR for DT three - day periods preceding and following DT shutdown was below DT long - term average . These observations support DT hypothesis IN contrails MD contribute to NN NN by making days colder and nights warmer . With DT expected future increase in JJ aircraft traffic , some NNS expect DT contribution of contrails to NN NN to become more significant ; DT average contrail sky coverage expected to more than double by 2050 . At this point , PRP is not known whether more contrails will have a net NN or cooling effect on JJ NN . Driving Question : How do clouds and precipitation form ! Clouds whisk across DT sky in ever - changing patterns of white and gray ; fog lends an eerie silence to a dreary day . Clouds and fog are products of condensation or deposition of NN vapor within DT atmosphere . Most clouds are DT consequence of saturation brought about by uplift and expansional cooling of air . Fog is a cloud WDT forms near , or in contact , with NNP ’s surface ; most fogs develop when DT lowest layer of air is chilled to saturation via radiational or advective cooling . Cloud formation is an essential part of DT JJ NN cycle because without clouds EX MD be no rain or snow . And yet most clouds — even those associated with large storm systems — do not produce precipitation . DT principal subjects of this chapter are DT development and classification of clouds and fog , plus DT formation and types of precipitation . PRP RB examine weather radar , a valuable tool for locating and tracking areas of precipitation and for monitoring air motion within weather systems . This chapter closes with a summary of DT various direct and remote methods for measuring precipitation . NN vapor is an invisible component of air , but its condensation and deposition products ( NN droplets and NN crystals ) are visible . A cloud is DT visible product of condensation or deposition of NN vapor within DT atmosphere ; PRP consists of an aggregate of minute NN droplets and / or NN crystals suspended in DT atmosphere . This section covers DT process of cloud development . Clouds are increasingly likely to form as air nears saturation . But when NNS try to simulate this process in DT laboratory using a clean - air chamber , a cloud does not form even if DT relative humidity is elevated well above 100 % , DT is , to supersaturation values . A clean - air chamber is an enclosed container of air from which all solid and liquid particles ( aerosols ) have been filtered out . Introducing NN vapor into DT chamber raises DT relative humidity , but even if DT relative humidity is elevated to as high as 200 % , no cloud forms . How is DT possible ? PRP expect IN once air becomes saturated ( relative to a flat - NN surface ) , condensation MD initially produce extremely small droplets and those droplets MD eventually grow into cloud droplets through additional condensation . However , droplets will not form in DT first place unless DT relative humidity rises to extraordinarily high levels of supersaturation . Tiny droplets cannot form in a cloud chamber without a supersaturated environment because of DT so - called curvature effect . DT curvature of a NN surface affects DT ability of NN molecules to escape ( vaporize ) from DT NN surface . DT smaller DT droplet , DT greater is DT concentration of surrounding NN vapor WDT is necessary for DT droplet to grow . DT curvature of DT surface of a spherical NN droplet increases as DT radius of DT droplet decreases ; DT is , DT surface of a small droplet has a greater curvature than DT surface of a large droplet . ( At DT limit , a flat - NN surface has no curvature . ) With increasing curvature , molecules WDT form DT surface of a droplet have fewer neighboring molecules and are more weakly bonded . Molecules composing a flat - NN surface have DT most neighboring molecules and are most strongly bonded . Bond strength affects DT flux of NN molecules from DT liquid to vapor phase . For this reason , NN molecules more readily escape a NN droplet than a flat - NN surface and NN molecules more readily escape a small NN droplet than a large NN droplet . Consequently , at DT same temperature , DT saturation vapor pressure surrounding a small NN droplet is greater than DT surrounding a large droplet . Values of saturation vapor pressure listed in Table 6.3 are defined for air over a flat surface of fresh NN and are DT basis for computing relative humidity ( Chapter 6 ) . DT saturation vapor pressure increases with increasing curvature ( and decreasing droplet size ) . For droplets having a radius of 0.001 micrometer , DT saturation vapor pressure at a given temperature is about 3.4 times DT specified in Table 6.3 , which computes to a relative humidity of 340 % . On DT other hand , for droplets having a radius greater than 1.0 micrometer , DT difference between DT saturation vapor pressure surrounding DT droplet and DT values listed in Table 6.3 is minimal and computes to a relative humidity only slightly higher than 100 % . DT bottom line : In clean air , NN vapor will not condense into tiny NN droplets unless DT air is supersaturated to very high levels . In DT real atmosphere , DT relative humidity never even approaches such great supersaturation values , so tiny droplets cannot form or grow . What then makes cloud formation possible ? DT clean - air chamber experiment described above failed to produce a cloud because DT air was not sufficiently supersaturated . In DT real atmosphere , supersaturated air is not needed for clouds to develop ; in fact , cloud droplets readily form as DT relative humidity nears 100 % . And clouds are abundant ; at any given NN , about 60 % of DT NN is shrouded in clouds . How then , do cloud droplets form ? DT answer : PRP have a head start . Suspended in air are solid and liquid particles WDT provide relatively large surface areas on which condensation or deposition initially takes place . These naturally occurring particles WDT promote condensation or deposition in DT atmosphere are known as nuclei . Nuclei have radii greater than 1.0 micrometer and favor condensation ( or deposition ) of NN vapor . Once condensation ( or deposition ) starts , PRP become comparably sized cloud droplets ( or NN crystals ) . Additional growth of these droplets ( or NN crystals ) by condensation ( or deposition ) is more likely because PRP can grow in an environment with a relative humidity WDT exceeds 100 % by only 1 % or so . Most cloud particles have radii of 2 to 10 micrometers . ­­ Nuclei , essential for cloud formation , are abundant in DT atmosphere and are continually cycled into DT atmosphere from NNP ’s surface . Sources of nuclei include volcanic eruptions , wind erosion of soil , forest fires , and ocean spray . When NN waves break , drops of salt NN enter DT atmosphere and DT NN evaporates leaving behind tiny sea-salt crystals WDT function as nuclei ( Figure 7.2 ) . NNS from domestic and industrial chimneys RB contribute nuclei to DT atmosphere . Depending on DT product ( liquid NN droplets or NN crystals ) , a distinction is made between cloud condensation nuclei and NN - forming nuclei . Cloud condensation nuclei ( CCN ) promote condensation of NN vapor at temperatures both above and below DT freezing point of NN . Within DT atmosphere , NN vapor can condense into cloud droplets WDT remain liquid even at temperatures well below 00 C ( 320 F ) . Droplets at such temperatures are described as supercooled . NN - forming nuclei ( IN ) are much less common than CCNs and promote formation of NN crystals only at temperatures well below freezing . DT most efficient NN - forming nuclei are substances having a crystal structure similar to DT of NN and most are almost insoluble in NN . Clayey soil particles are excellent NN - forming nuclei . DT two types of NN - forming nuclei are freezing nuclei and deposition nuclei . Freezing nuclei are particles on which NN vapor condenses and subsequently freezes ; PRP are active at temperatures below about - 90 C ( 160 F ) . Hygroscopic nuclei are a special category of cloud condensation nuclei because PRP possess a chemical attraction for NN molecules . Condensation begins on hygroscopic nuclei at a relative humidity under 100 % . Magnesium chloride ( MgCl2 ) , a salt in sea-spray , can promote condensation at a relative humidity as low as 70 % ! Clouds form more efficiently where hygroscopic nuclei are abundant . JJ sources of hygroscopic nuclei exist in urban - industrial areas and this helps explain why localities downwind of large cities tend to be somewhat cloudier and rainier than upwind localities . DT Metropolitan Meteorological Experiment ( METROMEX ) conducted in DT 1970s demonstrated IN DT average summer rainfall was 5 % to 25 % greater within , and up to 50 to 75 km ( 31 to 47 mi ) downwind of St. Louis , MO than upwind of DT city . In more recent NNS , similar urban effects on precipitation were detected in Tokyo , Phoenix , and other cities . Besides being a source of hygroscopic nuclei , cities RB spur cloud and precipitation development by contributing NN vapor ( raising DT relative humidity ) and heat ( adding to DT buoyancy of air ) . Furthermore , DT relative roughness of a city surface induces convergence of horizontal winds , uplift of air , and expansional cooling ( Chapter 8 ) . Interestingly , not all NN crystals form on DT traditional nuclei described above . While sampling NN crystals in cold clouds from aircraft , NNS discovered IN DT concentration of NN crystals is highly variable within DT cloud and NN crystals are 10 to 1,000 times more numerous than nuclei .

Well , if an article by Jason Hickel in Foreign Policy , with DT sub - title “ If DT NN is n’t careful , renewable NN MD become as destructive as fossil fuels . ” is anything to VB by EX is very real reasons to be concerned ! Here is DT opening few paragraphs from DT article : DT conversation about NN NN has been blazing ahead in recent months . Propelled by DT school NN strikes and social movements IN Extinction Rebellion , a number of governments have declared a NN emergency , and progressive political parties are making plans — at last — for a rapid transition to clean NN under DT banner of DT Green NNP Deal . This is a welcome shift , and PRP need more of PRP . But a JJ problem is beginning to emerge WDT warrants our attention . Some proponents of DT Green NNP Deal seem to believe IN PRP will pave DT way to a utopia of “ green growth . ” Once PRP trade dirty fossil fuels for clean NN , EX ’s no reason PRP can’t keep expanding DT economy forever . This narrative MD seem reasonable enough at first glance , but EX are good reasons to VB twice about PRP . CD of them has to do with clean NN itself . DT phrase “ clean NN ” normally conjures up happy , innocent images of warm sunshine and fresh wind . But while sunshine and wind is obviously clean , DT infrastructure PRP need to capture PRP is not . Far from PRP . DT transition to renewables is VBG to require a dramatic increase in DT extraction of metals and rare - NN minerals , with real ecological and social costs . In 2017 , DT NNP Bank released a little - noticed report WDT offered DT first comprehensive look at this question . PRP models DT increase in material extraction WDT MD be required to build enough solar and wind utilities to produce an annual output of about 7 terawatts of electricity by 2050 . DT ’s enough to power roughly half of DT JJ economy . By doubling DT NNP Bank figures , PRP can estimate what PRP will take to VB all DT way to zero NNS — and DT results are staggering : 34 million metric tons of copper , 40 million tons of lead , 50 million tons of zinc , 162 million tons of aluminum , and no less than 4.8 billion tons of iron . So DT question is this , are PRP really moving to cleaner and greener forms of NN sources , or are PRP merely creating JJ problems to remove another ? Material extraction is a costly business , both financially and more importantly environmentally . With DT staggering amount of material resources required to replace fossil fuels with renewable NN sources its easy to see why JJ are so skeptical . • Social Distancing Was Created by DT CIA as a Torture Technique • UK Begins to Reopen Its Newly Created Dystopian Society to DT NN • Say Hello to DT Next Possible Pandemic • Biofields – Our Ability to Thrive & Prosper is Under Attack"

In fact , PRP was hot all across Europe DT NN . In DT Alps , glaciers melted , their snouts retreating up steep - sided valleys . Fires burned from France to Poland . And in DT wine country of central France , DT grapes withered to raisins on DT vine , so DT wine made from them was syrupy and extra-alcoholic . Normally , winemakers harvested grapes at DT very end of September or early October . But DT NN , PRP had to scurry to VB overripe grapes off DT vine weeks earlier than usual . Now , a nearly 700 - NN - long record of harvest dates from DT town of Beaune , in Burgundy , shows IN early harvest dates IN DT NN from 1540 are now par for DT course , thanks to NN NN . NNS and historians stitched together a record of grape harvest dates VBG back to 1354 . PRP found IN air temperatures have warmed so much — and especially in DT last 30 NNS — IN grapes are now harvested almost two weeks before their historical norm . “ PRP can clearly see DT reaction of DT grapes to DT rise in temperature , ” says Thomas Labbé , an historian at DT University of Leipzig . And DT reaction is changing DT wine itself . Wine , in Burgundy , is built into DT fabric of DT culture . DT pinot noir and chardonnay grapes DT region is known for have been growing RB and adapting to DT precise NN conditions of DT region for centuries . Winemakers VBP DT growth stages intimately : DT look of DT vines before PRP bud ; DT look of DT vines as PRP mature over long seasons ; and DT fat , sugary , fragrant curve of DT grapes when PRP ’re ready to be made into wine . DT harvest point is crucial . Too long on DT vine and DT grapes have too much sugar in them , meaning DT wine will be more alcoholic — not DT subtle feel most winemakers in DT region care for . Too long , and DT acids WDT give wine some of its feel in DT mouth MD disintegrate . Not long enough , and PRP might not have developed DT right balance of fragrant chemicals WDT give DT wine its characteristic flavours . Winemakers keep careful track of harvest dates , with some records stretching back to DT Middle Ages . In DT 1800s , NNS and historians realised IN those careful records MD be used to keep track of how DT NN in different parts of Europe has changed over NN . “ Grape harvest date records are DT longest records of phonology in Europe , ” says Elizabeth Wolkovich , a biologist at DT University of British Columbia who studies wine and NN relationships . “ PRP have these hundreds of NNS of records of what DT summer temp was JJ , and PRP can use them IN a thermometer . ” Grape harvest dates reflect DT temperature DT grapes have felt over DT course of DT growing season , from about April until PRP ’re picked . If DT spring and summer are hot , DT grapes mature faster and need to be picked sooner . If PRP 're cool , DT opposite is true . NN historians started to pull together ancient information from other sources , too . PRP matched up DT patterns in DT grape harvest data with records made from tree rings and DT length of glaciers in DT Alps . PRP used records IN those to figure out IN much of central Europe warmed up during DT Medieval Warm Period , from around 900 to 1300 . PRP had cooled down during DT Little NNP Age , from about DT 15th to DT 19th centuries . DT historians saw IN over DT past few hundred NNS , temperatures wobbled around , skewing warm for short stretches and cooling down in others . But overall , NN rocked up and down around a fairly consistent average value — until recently ."

DT model highlighted DT consequences of how DT interactions between a variety of NN NN factors , such as DT loss or weakening of carbon sinks , forest dieback , NN retreat and increased bacteria respiration , MD combine to form a feedback loop which accelerates NN NN . DT authors acknowledge IN EX are limits to their understanding of NN tipping , and further investigation is needed .

"" In other words , not acting is "" too risky to bet against "" in their view . And NN is of DT essence . Hope is not lost , however . Researchers say IN mitigating greenhouse gas NNS MD still slow down DT accumulation of these NN impacts . What is needed , PRP say , is urgent international action to cut NNS , slow NN level rise , and to keep NN to 1.5 C . "" A saving grace is IN DT rate at which damage accumulates from tipping -- and hence DT risk posed -- MD still be under our control to some extent , "" PRP VBD .

In DT stratosphere , miles above NNP ’s surface , small , airborne particles reflect sunlight back into space , which leads to a cooling influence at DT ground . These particles are RB called “ aerosols , ” and DT JJ paper explores their recent NN effects — DT reasons behind their increase remain DT subject of ongoing research . “ Since DT NN 2000 , stratospheric aerosols have caused a slower rate of NN NN than PRP MD have seen without them , ” says John Daniel , a physicist at DT NOAA NNP System Research Laboratory ( ESRL ) in Boulder , Colo . and an author of DT JJ NN . In fact PRP say IN DT NN is rapid and doubled in DT decade : PRP then admit PRP do n’t VB DT source of these aerosols but give this speculation : Introducing aerosols into DT upper atmosphere is call SRM for Solar Radiation Management . Here is DT Huges patent describing how PRP is done : ( Link ) A method is disclosed for reducing atmospheric NN due to DT greenhouse effect resulting from a greenhouse gases layer . DT method comprises DT step of seeding DT greenhouse gas layer with a quantity of tiny particles of materials … Such materials can include DT class of materials known as Welsbach materials . DT oxides of metal , e.g. , aluminum oxide , are RB suitable for DT purpose . CD technique proposed to seed DT metallic particles was to add DT tiny particles to DT fuel of jet airliners , so IN DT particles MD be emitted from DT jet engine exhaust while DT airliner was at its cruising altitude . Here is an extensive report on how to do PRP and how much PRP MD cost : Aurora Report So NOAA is showing these aerosols are mysteriously appearing in DT upper atmospher , admit PRP do n’t VB why … yet EX is lots of active political action to spread these same aerosols ….. hmmmm …. So if PRP ’s in DT air , are PRP seeing PRP fall to DT ground ? I mean if PRP are spraying aluminum PRP MD see PRP affecting plants and animals right ? Extremely high quantities of aluminum , barium , strontium , and other metals and chemicals are showing up in rainwater , surface NN and air . In just DT last four NNS , citizens in DT Pacific Northwest ( Northern CA , Oregon ) have taken dozens of tests where DT levels of aluminum , for example , has escalated hundreds of times from DT first tests , which were already unusually high . Some tests of single rain events had elevated nearly 50,000 % from DT original 7 ppb . These tests correspond with DT NN of California ’s own test results … This data matches data from other citizen and environmental groups testing nationwide as well as Europe . Dangerous levels of aluminum , barium and other contaminants have saturated most surface waters in much of DT NNP and all NATO NNS . DT metals found exactly match DT primary elements listed in a host of “ geo-engineering patents ” Patents ( assigned to Hughes Aircraft , DOD , Raytheon , and others ) describe DT specific goal of creating artificial cloud cover ( reflecting , therefore cooling ) , and other forms of weather / NN modification . DT California Air Quality Resources Board has studied aerosols migrating from NNP and these rainwater and air metals ( matching DT patents ) are not present in rain or air approaching our continent . DT contamination begins on - shore , though clearly just off - shore as well . Recent soil testing and analysis reveals IN soil PH ’s are now changing tremendously . A number of studies VBP conclusively IN bio-available aluminum is highly detrimental to countless organisms , including conifers .. Sierra Nevada firs have died or begun dying by DT stands , even in riparian areas where PRP never lack NN . In DT same four NNS ( California ) , alarming declines in amphibians have RB been observed . Aluminum drives PH towards base ( alkaline ) , RB severely affecting DT forests . Maybe PRP are finding DT reasons for all DT mass die offs … Birds , snakes , bats , bees , all sorts of aquatic wildlife are being affected . EX was a recent report in England about how DT snakes are in rapid decline and EX is an unpublished report PRP are working on in DT NNP WDT shows DT same thing . DT females are dying faster than DT males and CD theory is because PRP store fat for breeding which is being loaded with toxic chemicals . PRP is not proof positive , but a good circumstantial case . PRP are getting closer to clear evidence someone has begun geoengineering . Our NN has a long history of lieing first , admitting later . Look at MK ULTRA , radiation experiments , and JJ JJ more : PRP called Elmer Allen crazy because he was telling DT NN he was a human ginny pig for radiation experiments … PRP only admitted PRP after he was dead and gave DT family money for damages . doe.gov"

What_WP do_VBP you_PRP think_VB about_IN all_DT of_IN this_DT ?_.","While PRP have been hearing about this kind of thing for a while now , PRP is about to become reality . A group of Harvard NNS are VBG to be working to fight NN NN in a very interesting way . DT attempts PRP will be making MD drastically VB things . Basically , PRP will be using different sprays to reflect sunlight artificially and in doing this work to reduce DT temperature . While DT idea is controversial at best if PRP works , PRP might be able to see real changes . This project is called Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment ( SCoPEx ) and will be about three million dollars right off DT bat just for testing . Through this experiment , Harvard officials hope to advance their understandings on stratospheric aerosols in general so IN PRP can be determined whether PRP are actually useful or not . PRP is thought IN these researchers will be able to reduce their levels of uncertainty and determine DT risks and benefits of solar geoengineering . If these sprays MD potentially eliminate or reduce our ozone loss in DT long run without risks , PRP might have a good solution for now . Harvard wrote as follows on DT experiment itself : At DT heart of SCoPEx is a propelled scientific balloon WDT can travel a few meters per second ( walking speed ) relative to DT surrounding air . DT propellers serve two functions . First , DT propeller wake forms a well - mixed volume ( roughly 1 km long and 100 meters in diameter ) WDT serves as an experimental ‘ beaker ’ in which PRP can add gasses or particles . Second , DT propellers allow PRP to fly DT gondola back and forth through DT volume to measure DT properties of DT perturbed air . DT advantage of DT SCoPEx propelled balloon is IN PRP allows PRP to create a small controlled volume of stratospheric air and observe its evolution for ( PRP hope ) over 24 hours . Hence DT acronym , Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment . If PRP used an aircraft instead of a balloon , PRP MD not be able to use such a small perturbed volume nor MD PRP be able to observe PRP for such long durations . SCoPEx builds on four decades of research on DT environmental chemistry of DT ozone layer in DT Anderson / Keith / Keutsch groups . SCoPEx will use or adapt JJ of DT high - performance sensors and flight - system engineering experience developed for this ozone research . Analyzing these experiments will improve our knowledge beyond what is currently available within computer models or is measurable with confidence under laboratory conditions . For this experiment , frozen NN will be released or so researchers NN . This being for now until PRP move forward and release calcium carbonate and other minerals . This whole operation is according to a release funded by DT internal Harvard research funds WDT are provided by Professor David Keith and Frank Keutsch as well as Harvard ’s Solar Geoengineering Research Program . PRP do not VB what results will be obtained through this but researchers believe PRP have a good idea of what will come . According to Forbes , DT basis around this experiment is from studying DT effects of large volcanic eruptions on DT NN ’s temperature . Because computer models can only VB so far taking this out into DT field and giving PRP a NN is DT next step . This geoengineering technique MD really VB things . DT being VBN , some studies suggest IN spraying sunlight reflective particles into DT atmosphere MD have lots of consequences and kill off crops or VB weather patterns at DT very least . To learn more about SCoPEx please feel free to click here . While this report is older , PRP is still full of a lot of information on DT experiment itself .

Researchers have shown IN DT Great Dying , which killed almost all of NNP 's ocean creatures around 250 million NNS ago , was caused by rising JJ temperates . Continued natural changes to DT NNP 's NN - not to be confused with Al Gore 's brand of "" NNP NNP "" - MD lead to a repeat of DT Great Dying , which killed off 96 percent of life on NNP , millions of NNS before humans had even evolved . NNS believe IN JJ temperatures MD again rise to levels WDT MD be unsustainable for DT majority of life WDT inhabits our NN . Long before DT dawn of DT dinosaurs , NNP was populated with plants and animals WDT were mostly obliterated after a series of massive volcanic eruptions in Siberia . DT mass extinction , triggered 252 million NNS ago , essentially set life on our NN back to square CD , and was followed by a period spanning millions of NNS in which life had to multiply and evolve once more . Now researchers have shown IN DT Great Dying , which killed 96 percent of NNP 's ocean creatures , was caused by JJ NN . As volcanoes belched gases into DT atmosphere , NNP 's oceans heated up , and its NN waters MD no longer hold enough oxygen for life to survive . NNS at DT University of Washington warned IN a similar event MD occur within DT next few hundred NNS . "" By 2100 , NN in DT upper ocean will have approached 20 percent of NN in DT late Permian , and by DT NN 2300 PRP will reach between 35 and 50 percent , "" VBD NN author Justin Penn . "" This NN highlights DT potential for a mass extinction arising from a similar mechanism . "" DT Washington team ran computer models to simulate DT effects of DT Great Dying on NNP 's ancient oceans . PRP showed IN sulfur , ash , and other gases pumped into DT atmosphere from volcanic eruptions starved NNP 's oceans of 80 percent of their oxygen . This is because as DT oceans heated up , creatures and plants used up more oxygen as their metabolism increased . About half DT oceans ' seafloor , mostly at deeper depths , became completely oxygen - free and uninhabitable to almost all life on NNP . For DT last few hundred NNS , DT NNP has showed signs of following a similar pattern to DT situation in DT late Permian , researchers warned . "" This is DT first NN IN PRP have made a mechanistic prediction about what caused DT extinction WDT can be directly tested with DT fossil record , "" Mr. Penn VBD .

A green fund can come in DT form of a focused investment vehicle for companies engaged in environmentally supportive businesses , such as alternative NN , green transport , NN and waste management , and sustainable living . A green fund 's strategy can be based on some of DT following characteristics : avoiding negative company criteria ( businesses such as guns , alcohol , gambling , pornography , animal testing , etc. ) ; choosing positive company criteria ( environmental programs , NN conservation , fair trade , etc. ) ; or a combination of both strategies . Based on performance , PRP is not yet clear whether green funds and socially responsible investing ( SRI ) can consistently create better returns for investors , but PRP do represent a proactive step toward environmental consciousness , which JJ investors see as valuable . Some have cited green investing as having begun in earnest during DT 1990s , a period where investors were more seriously taking into account DT harm businesses or DT pressure entire industries were putting on DT environment . In DT wake of headline - grabbing events IN DT Exxon Valdez oil spill , and large and protracted fights over logging rights in DT Pacific Northwest , a set of investors began to view businesses WDT were better at managing their environmental impact as more valuable than those who MD n't . These types of businesses , in some investors ' eyes , were not only operating in a more ethical manner but had a competitive advantage over companies who were ill - equipped to reduce their impact on DT environment . Still , other investors saw an ethical obligation in investing in technologies and businesses WDT were looking to build a sustainable society through renewable NN sources . Some of DT sectors where this investment has been taking place include DT renewable NN , and buildings and efficiency sector . DT renewable NN sector is a broad NN , including solar NN , wind , battery , and NN storage technologies , as well as DT materials WDT help make those technologies possible . DT buildings sector includes builders who use NN - efficient materials , making each building 's carbon footprint smaller – whether PRP 're being used for commercial , residential , or office use . Socially conscious investing has continued to gain popularity , which is due largely to increased worldwide exposure to DT issue of NN NN , as well as increased federal funding for alternative NN and other programs . Since 2007 , DT Green Transition Scoreboard , a project run by Ethical Markets NNP and DT NNP Prosperity Alliance , has tracked $ 8.1 trillion invested in DT green economy through DT end of 2016 , more than halfway to DT goal of $ 10 trillion invested by 2020 . Some of DT green mutual funds WDT are available include DT TIAA - CREF Social Choice Equity Fund ( TICRX ) ; Portfolio 21 NNP Equity Fund Class R ( PORTX ) 21 ; and DT Green Century balanced ( GCBLX ) . Money has poured into green funds as investors seek both socially responsible investments and returns from DT uptick in green technologies such as wind and solar power . Inflows into socially conscious funds quadrupled to more than $ 4.3 trillion from 2012 to 2014 , with DT number of funds growing by 28 % . Despite sometimes high fees , DT funds have RB garnered relatively solid performance . Socially responsible funds returned 8.1 % versus 8.4 % for non-socially responsible funds over DT three NNS ended March 31 , 2018 . For DT 10 NNS ended on March 31 , 2018 , DT funds turned in 8.91 % versus 9.1 % for their non-socially responsible peers ."

Data from NASA and DT Brazilian National Institute for Space Research ( INPE ) points to stressed NN conditions : DT soil is drier , temperatures are higher , and groundwater is depleted . Peak rainy season , which runs from December to February , was among DT top 10 worst on record this NN , with just 75 % of DT season ’s usual rainfall . Last NN , wildfire and deforestation in DT Amazon hit DT highest levels in a decade . But DT flames were contained by DT rainforest ’s natural humidity after several months of intense rainfall . This NN , DT rainforest MD not be so lucky . Since taking office in January 2019 , Brazil ’s NNP Jair Bolsonaro has scaled back environmental protections and pushed to VB DT country ’s legislation to open up indigenous reserves to mining and other development activities WDT are DT main drivers of Amazon destruction . DT NN has RB cut down on environmental raids amid DT NN - CD pandemic , opening DT doors to increased deforestation , wildcat mining and land grabbing . As a result , deforestation this NN increased 51 % through March compared to DT first quarter of 2019 , according to INPE . DT deforestation figure for August 2019 to DT end of March 2020 is reportedly nearly twice DT of DT same period a NN earlier . Adding a drier NN to DT mix , experts warn , MD be lethal for DT forest , intensifying forest dieback and allowing more untouched , healthy forest to catch fire in DT long term . Although weather forecasts for DT Amazon are highly unpredictable , which MD potentially reverse DT current deficit , NN models by Brazil ’s Center for Weather Forecasting and NNP Research ( CPTEC ) show no indication of above - average precipitation in DT coming months . “ PRP are entering a drier season where rains are not [ usually ] intense enough to impact DT potential for fire and other factors related to DT dry season , ” CPTEC climatologist Diego Jatobá told Mongabay . NN shortages in DT soil right after a rainy season RB signal trouble later on in DT NN , says NASA scientist and hydrologist Matthew Rodell , who works with NASA ’s Gravity Recovery and NN Experiment Follow - On ( GRACE - FO ) satellites monitoring NN levels stored deep beneath DT NNP ’s surface . Their data are used to predict drought worldwide . Recent GRACE -FO images of South America have shown large areas of Brazil ’s Amazon and Cerrado biomes in DT deep red zone , meaning NN levels are severely impacted . “ If PRP see normal to low precipitation this NN , then EX is potential for drought , ” Rodell told Mongabay in a telephone interview . “ I MD be concerned . ” But for Ane Alencar , DT head of DT Amazon Environmental Research Institute ( IPAM ) and a specialist in rainforest wildfires , an increase in fires this NN depends far more on political decisions than NN conditions , which she expects will be within an average range . “ I have DT worst possible expectations about uncontrolled human - induced deforestation and fire ignition this NN . Spontaneous combustion does n’t exist in DT Amazon , ” she told Mongabay . A technical report by IPAM published this week RB anticipates a surge in fires caused by DT deforestation spike of 2019 , as DT modus operandi of land grabbers is to deforest CD NN then set fire DT next , in order to successfully transform forest into farmland and pastures . Drier soil conditions overlap with high deforestation rates . In northern Pará NN , home to 40 % of all deforestation in DT Brazilian Amazon last NN , early fires MD happen , NN maps show . In DT area around DT city of Santarém , which already has DT highest deforestation rates in DT Amazon , fires and land clearing MD RB spike after DT recent paving of DT BR - 163 highway WDT cuts through DT Amazon rainforest , described by Bolsonaro on Twitter as “ at DT heart of agribusiness . ” DT gradual drying of DT Amazon has concerned NNS for decades , as PRP threatens to set off a cycle of forest dieback WDT MD push DT rainforest over its tipping point , turning rainforest into degraded savanna . In recent NNS , extreme weather events IN droughts and floods have increased and published data show dry seasons getting longer and more severe . But figures on DT Amazon rainy season are JJ . According to rainfall data shared with Mongabay by CPTEC , eight of DT 10 driest rainy seasons in Brazil ’s northern region recorded since 1962 happened after DT NN 2000 . “ PRP have observed a negative trend , a significant sign of reduction in rain through DT NNS , ” CPTEC scientist Jatobá told Mongabay . Nevertheless , EX is still some hope for reversing DT current scenario . According to Nepstad , some steps are already being taken by a part of DT agribusiness sector to encourage farmers to plant trees . “ Farmers are on DT hook to plant 6 million hectares ( 14.8 million acres ) in DT next 20 NNS , but PRP often do n’t have enough money or incentives to do this . This is part of DT solution , ” he VBD ."

Former British chancellor Lord Lawson was DT latest to demand an impartial investigation be launched into DT scandal , which arrives just weeks before DT UN NN conference in Copenhagen . “ PRP should set up a JJ inquiry under someone who is totally respected and VB to DT truth , ” he told DT BBC Radio Four Today programme . DT emails were leaked at DT end of last week after hackers penetrated DT servers of DT Climatic Research Unit , which is based at DT University of East Anglia , in eastern England . DT CRU is described as CD of DT leading NN research bodies in DT NN . DT hacked documents and communications reveal how top NNS conspired to falsify data in DT face of declining JJ temperatures in order to prop up DT premise IN man-made factors are driving NN NN . Others illustrate how PRP embarked on a venomous and coordinated campaign to ostracize NN skeptics and use their influence to keep dissenting reports from appearing in peer - reviewed journals , as well as using cronyism to avoid compliance with Freedom of Information Act requests . As expected , DT establishment NN has gone into whitewash overdrive , characterizing DT emails as evidence of “ rancor ” amongst DT NN community and focusing on some of DT lesser emails while ignoring DT true significance of what has been revealed . Organizations with close ties to DT CRU have engaged in psychological terrorism by fearmongering about DT NN with doomsday scenarios , illustrating their argument with outlandish propaganda animation videos which show pets drowning and others WDT show computer - generated polar bears crashing to NN in a throwback to 9/11 victims jumping from DT towers , when in reality polar bear population figures are thriving . “ CD of DT emails under scrutiny , written by Phil Jones , DT centre ’s director , in 1999 , reads : “ I ’ve just completed Mike ’s Nature [ DT NN journal ] trick of adding in DT real temps to each series for DT last 20 NNS ( ie , from 1981 onwards ) and from 1961 for Keith ’s to hide DT decline , ” reports DT London Telegraph . DT author admitted to DT Associated Press IN DT e mail was genuine . In another example , researchers discuss data WDT is “ artificially adjusted to look closer to DT real temperatures ” . Apparently , DT “ real temperatures ” are whatever JJ NN cheerleaders VBP them to be . As Anthony Watts writes , attempts to claim e mails are “ out of context , ” as DT defense has been from CRU , cannot apply in this instance . PRP can claim an email PRP wrote NNS ago is n’t accurate saying PRP was “ taken out of context ” , but a programmer making notes in DT code does so IN he / she can document what DT code is actually doing at DT stage , so IN anyone who looks at PRP later can figure out why this function does n’t plot past 1960 . In this case , PRP is not allowing all of DT temperature data to be plotted . Growing season data ( summer months when DT JJ tree rings are formed ) past 1960 is thrown out because “ these will be artificially adjusted to look closer to DT real temperatures ” , which implies some post processing routine . Spin DT , spin PRP to DT moon if PRP VBP . I ’ll believe programmer notes over DT word of somebody who stands to gain from suggesting EX ’s nothing “ untowards ” about PRP . Either DT data tells DT story of nature or PRP does not . Data WDT has been “ artificially adjusted to look closer to DT real temperatures ” is false data , yielding a false result . Another email discusses changing temperature data to fix “ blips ” in studies so as to make them conform with expectations , which of course is DT cardinal sin of scientific research . “ NN , collusion in exaggerating NN data , possibly illegal destruction of embarrassing information , organized resistance to disclosure , manipulation of data , private admissions of flaws in their JJ claims and much more ” was revealed in DT 61 megabites of confidential files released on DT Internet for anyone to read , writes Andrew Bolt . Another email appears to celebrate DT death of NN NN skeptic John L Daly , with DT words , “ In an odd way this is cheering NN . ” In another communication , DT author expresses his fantasy to “ beat DT crap out of ” NN NN skeptics . In another exchange , researchers appear to discuss ways to discredit James Saiers of DT Geophysical Research Letters journal , by means of an academic witch hunt , because of his sympathies with NN NN skeptics . “ If PRP VBP IN Saiers is in DT greenhouse skeptics camp , then , if PRP can find documentary evidence of this , PRP MD VB through official AGU channels to VB him ousted . ” Other emails express doubt about whether DT NN is really heating up and infer IN data needs to be reinterpreted . “ DT fact is IN PRP ca n’t account for DT lack of NN at DT moment and PRP is a travesty WDT PRP can ’t . DT CERES data published in DT August BAMS 09 supplement on 2008 shows EX should be even more NN : but DT data are surely wrong . Our observing system is inadequate . ” NNS discuss trying to disguise historical data WDT contradicts DT man-made NN NN thesis , such as DT Medieval Warm Period ( MWP ) , which must be ‘ contained ’ according to CD email . Suppression of evidence is RB discussed , with NNS resolving to delete embarrassing emails . “ And , perhaps most reprehensibly , ” writes James Delingpole , a long series of communications discussing how best to squeeze dissenting NNS out of DT peer review process . How , in other words , to create a scientific NN in which anyone who disagrees with AGW can be written off as a crank , whose views do not have a scrap of authority . ” “ This was DT danger of always criticising DT skeptics for not publishing in DT “ peer - reviewed literature ” . Obviously , PRP found a solution to DT –take over a journal ! So what do PRP do about this ? I VBP PRP have to stop considering “ NNP Research ” as a legitimate peer - reviewed journal . Perhaps PRP should encourage our colleagues in DT NN research community to no longer submit to , or cite papers in , this journal . PRP MD RB need to consider what PRP tell or request of our more reasonable colleagues who currently sit on DT editorial board … What do others VB ? ” “ I will be emailing DT journal to tell them I ’m having nothing more to do with PRP until PRP rid themselves of this troublesome editor . ” “ PRP results from this journal having a number of editors . DT responsible NN for this is a well - known skeptic in NZ . He has let a few papers through by Michaels and Gray in DT past . I ’ve had words with Hans von Storch about this , but got nowhere . Another thing to discuss in Nice ! ” NNS RB “ discussed ways of dodging Freedom of Information Act requests to release temperature data , ” reports DT Daily Mail . DT emails show IN NNS relied on cronyism and cosying up to FOIA officials to prevent them from being forced to release data . “ When DT FOI requests began here , DT FOI person VBD PRP had to abide by DT requests , ’ DT email says . “ PRP took a couple of half - hour sessions to convince them otherwise . ” “ Once PRP became aware of DT types of NNS PRP were dealing with , everyone at UEA became very supportive . I ’ve got to VB DT FOI person quite well and DT chief librarian – who deals with appeals . ” PRP is important to stress IN this compendium merely scratches DT surface of DT monumental levels of fraud WDT have been exposed as a result of DT hacked emails . NNS will look back on this moment as DT beginning of DT end for JJ NN alarmism and DT agenda to implement draconian measures of regulation and control along with DT levy of a JJ carbon tax . JJ more revelations will be forthcoming as a result of this leak , and DT desperate effort on behalf of DT establishment to whitewash DT whole issue will only end up making DT damage worse ."

Our_PRP$ response_NN to_IN it_PRP is_VBZ n’t_RB ._.","DT JJ strike on Friday September 20 , 2019 was DT largest demonstration for NN action in history . DT movement WDT started with Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg in August 2018 has now mobilised millions , while Extinction Rebellion and other protest groups have escalated their campaigns on streets around DT NN . From DT efforts of activists in different NNS , radical “ Green JJ Deals ” are emerging as a bold , political response to DT NN crisis . “ DT NN is waking up , ” Thunberg told NN leaders at DT recent UN NNP Action Summit . “ And NN is coming whether PRP VBP PRP or not . ” But how long DT awakening takes MD be decisive for NN this century . A report published ahead of DT summit declared IN DT impacts of NN NN are accelerating – growth rates of carbon dioxide ( CO₂ ) in DT atmosphere were nearly 20 % higher in DT 2015 - CD period than DT previous five NNS , while DT average rate of NN level rise has increased to 5 mm per NN over roughly DT same period . CD author warned IN limiting JJ temperature rise to 2 °C MD require tripling current commitments to reduce NNS . To hold temperatures at 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels , JJ ambition MD need to increase by a factor of five . DT debate over whether NN NN is happening is over , and DT conversation about what should be done is beginning in earnest . As such , for DT past few weeks , PRP ’ve asked experts from around DT NN to describe how DT NN should respond to DT threat of NN breakdown . PRP share their insights here . DT NN of DT NNP Nowhere are DT effects of NN NN more visible than in DT Arctic – a region WDT ’s estimated to be VBG at least twice as fast as DT JJ average . Arctic NN NN reached its second - lowest extent on record in September 2019 – a mere 1.6 m square miles . A JJ report by DT Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) has revealed DT changes WDT are underway in DT oceans and DT NN - covered regions of DT NN , and DT message is stark . “ Glaciers and NN sheets are shrinking . JJ NN level is rising at more than twice DT rate of DT 20th century . DT ocean is NN , becoming more acidic and losing oxygen . Fifty percent of coastal wetlands have been lost over DT past 100 NNS . Species are shifting , biodiversity is declining and ecosystems are losing their integrity and function . ” NNP ’s oceans have absorbed more than 90 % of DT excess heat in DT JJ NN system , but not without repercussions . Marine heatwaves are causing coral reefs to bleach and mass die - offs of fish and other wildlife . Not only does this added ocean heat wreak havoc on marine ecosystems , but PRP is changing DT relationship between coastal communities and DT ocean . Wildlife populations are struggling to adapt to DT disruption , both in DT oceans and on land . As a result , a landmark report from an international team of biodiversity experts earlier in 2019 called for “ transformative NN ” to economies and societies to prevent up to a million species VBG extinct . Five steps to restrain NNS right now “ DT UK , Norway , Sweden and France have written a target of net - zero NNS into law , [ but ] targets are , by definition , a statement of nothing more than intent . In and of themselves , PRP do not remove a single molecule of carbon dioxide from DT atmosphere . ” Limiting JJ temperature rise to 1.5 °C means DT NN has to be at net - zero carbon NNS by 2050 . But PRP ’s cumulative NNS WDT count – if NNS leave decarbonisation until DT last minute , PRP will be too late . Rebecca Willis , a professor of NN and NN policy at Lancaster University in DT UK , outlines five measures WDT can begin to restrain NNS right now : • None Task all NN departments with a NN agenda so IN PRP ’re obligated to show how their policies will contribute to NNS cuts . • None Engage DT NN in developing NN strategies with citizens ’ assemblies and involve workers in designing policy to ensure a “ just transition ” from carbon - intensive industries IN coal mining . • None Enact “ symbolic policies ” to set DT investment NN and catalyse radical NN – ban advertising for petrol cars for instance , or allow NNS to generate and sell renewable NN at home . • None Keep all remaining fossil fuels in DT ground – ban oil and gas exploration and end DT NNP $ 5.2 trillion spent on subsidising DT fossil fuel industry each NN . • None Set aside negative emission technologies – carbon capture and storage might play a role in absorbing greenhouse gases from DT atmosphere in future , but PRP do n’t exist at a meaningful scale yet . Relying on them distracts resources from cutting NNS now . EX are technologies WDT already exist which are very good at capturing CO₂ . Plants have perfected DT process of turning carbon in DT air into solid , living material over billions of NNS . Natural NN solutions mobilise this potential by restoring forests , wetlands and other habitats . CD estimate from DT UK suggests each hectare of JJ forest can absorb DT annual carbon NNS of 90 cars . But PRP ’s not as simple as letting nature do all DT hard work , says Sebastian Leuzinger , an associate professor at DT Auckland University of Technology . DT “ right tree should be planted at DT right NN in DT right place ” : • None Tree species WDT grow fast are able to store carbon more rapidly , but slower , bigger trees will ultimately store more in DT long run . • None Non-native trees MD be better at absorbing carbon efficiently than native species , so keep an open mind to their role . • None When choosing a species to plant , trust local foresters and DT community WDT will have to live alongside and nurture them . Natural NN solutions can RB help society adapt to DT inevitable changes ahead . Zita Sebesvari , head of environmental vulnerability and ecosystem services at NNP Nations University , argues IN DT value of rewilding here is two - fold : removing DT CO₂ WDT exacerbates NN NN while mitigating its impacts . How to feed DT NN Leaving room for nature seems radical when humans currently exploit more than 70 % of DT NNP ’s NN - free surface , much of PRP to grow food . PRP ’s estimated IN a third of all greenhouse gas NNS originate with agriculture – from deforesting farmland to raising livestock WDT belch methane . Farming for meat and dairy can use up to 100 times DT land area to produce a single gram of protein compared to beans , nuts and other plant sources . Little wonder IN NNS are encouraged to eat less of PRP , and Alessandro Demaio , a fellow in JJ NN at DT University of Copenhagen , recommends a “ planetary NN diet ” which involves reducing meat intake in Western NNS by 50 % . He RB calls for : • None Recycling organic waste as fertiliser and investing in agroforestry – where trees are grown around crops to increase biodiversity . • None Breeding drought - resistant crop strains , making animal feed more nutritious and creating additives WDT can make livestock emit 30 % less methane . Sean Beer , a lecturer in agriculture at Bournemouth University , argues IN eating more local and seasonal produce MD VB some way to decarbonising agriculture . Reviving traditional food supply systems MD RB be key to guaranteeing sustainable diets for all , says Jagannath Adhikari , a sessional lecturer at DT University of NNP South Wales . In parts of DT Himalayas , DT answer to this problem is “ food forests ” . Local NNS plant useful trees and grow crops in DT woodland near their homes , and protect what grows RB naturally . PRP harvest what PRP need – mushrooms , honey , roots and edible plants – and sell any surplus at a market . Since community rights were restored to forest management here , worrying trends in deforestation and poverty have been reversed . Some politicians are now supporting policies WDT address NN NN by transforming national economies under DT umbrella of a Green NNP Deal . Spain ’s socialist party was recently reelected on a Green NNP Deal platform , for example , and , in DT UK , DT Labour Party has voted in favour of CD . DT idea was born in DT UK in 2007 , but has been gaining ground around DT NN lately , especially in DT NNP where PRP has been championed by congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez . Although DT specifics vary , a Green NNP Deal involves large investments in clean NN sector jobs and infrastructure to decarbonise DT economy and correct inequalities through job guarantees and universal basic services such as free JJ transport and healthcare . Governments MD RB be expected to slash or eliminate DT billions PRP spend on subsidising DT cost of fossil fuels . Experts RB urge for DT inclusion of DT insurance industry in Green NNP Deal discussions . A recent report from Cambridge University emphasised DT large losses insurers will face under NN NN and warns IN PRP MD spark a JJ financial crisis . >“ If governments respond appropriately to DT urgent warning issued by DT Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) in October [ 2018 ] , efforts to phase out fossil fuels will have to ramp up considerably — and quickly . ” Already , EX has been a slew of lawsuits against DT largest fossil fuel companies in an effort to hold them accountable for misleading DT NN on DT risks of NN NN while selling products WDT have contributed to PRP . Litigation , thus far , has not been successful , but DT tide MD be turning . In DT NNP , more than a dozen cities , counties and NNS are seeking damages from NN companies for DT DT costs of NN NN , from retrofitting storm drains to upgrading NN walls . These lawsuits draw on litigation against tobacco companies and on scientific research WDT attributes greenhouse gas NNS to NN companies . In DT past , “ DT plaintiffs had difficulties tracing NN harms to specific NNS made by particular corporations … Scientific research has evolved dramatically since then . ” says Lisa Benjamin , from Lewis & Clark College of Law , in Portland , Oregon . For example , in Europe , a German court has agreed to hear a Peruvian farmer ’s case against DT German NN giant RWE for its role in melting DT glaciers near his hometown of Huaraz and raising DT risks of landslides and flooding . A NN found RWE was responsible for 0.47 % of historic NNS , so DT farmer is seeking 0.47 % of DT cost for his community to adapt to NN NN . As DT impacts of NN NN become more clear , Thunberg ’s not DT only NN questioning DT “ fairy tales of eternal JJ growth ” . Producing stuff consumes NN , and producing more stuff , whether PRP ’s fast fashion or smartphones , means DT ongoing and growing consumption of NN . “ This makes PRP very hard to decarbonise DT economy , ” says Simon Mair at DT University of Surrey . If PRP stopped chasing productivity growth , decarbonisation MD come easier , PRP ’d have less “ crap ” and PRP might start investing NN and human NN into good jobs WDT matter , IN teaching and nursing . DT NN is finally listening to DT experts Despite DT potentially massive implications of a 2 °C rise in JJ temperature , NN NN has remained low on DT NN agenda . Journalists and their NN organisations have largely failed to give NN VB DT attention PRP deserves and have failed to press political figures on NN issues and policies . NNS ago , NN journalists threw away DT notion of putting scientific fact and NN denier opinion on equal ground . Other NNS are finally catching up and providing analysis and verification , and improving DT scientific literacy of their audience . PRP are connecting NN NN to local stories , focusing on solutions ( instead of “ doom and gloom ” coverage ) and adjusting their language to describe DT “ NN crisis ” . These shifts in journalism MD yield more action on NN NN . Young NNS tend to avoid negative NN headlines ; PRP do n’t VB their NN coverage to present a bleak and certain future . Instead , PRP VBP stories about DT “ system NN ” necessary to create zero- carbon societies , says Julie Doyle , from DT University of Brighton . PRP ’s not IN PRP ca n’t handle DT bad NN , but IN “ PRP wanted to be involved in rethinking socioeconomic systems , and are inspired and empowered by working together . ” DT ’s why “ system NN not NN NN ” has became DT rallying cry of DT young NN strikers . Thunberg ’s journey from a lonely vigil outside DT Swedish parliament to a Nobel Peace Prize nominee at DT head of a JJ movement took just over a NN . PRP seems DT NN really is waking up , but now comes DT hard part – changing DT systems WDT fuel DT NN crisis before PRP ’s too late .

""_''","TOPEKA , Kan . -- Environmentalists are struggling to VB lawmakers to even discuss NN NN as a serious issue in Kansas , where some leaders of DT Republican - controlled Legislature question DT widespread scientific consensus IN human activity is dangerously VBG DT NN . NNS such as Virginia , Minnesota and California are pursuing goals for eventually getting all of their electricity from renewable resources . But Kansas proposals aimed at reducing electricity use , making NN office space more NN efficient and encouraging farmers to capture and store greenhouse gases have languished without committee hearings . Environmentalists had to schedule their own NN NN hearing earlier this month outside of lawmakers ' regular meetings . Even more galling for them , a House committee 's first foray Thursday into environmental policy was a hearing on a business - backed measure to bar cities and counties from banning single - use plastic bags or straws . Some Republicans worry about DT costs of pursuing initiatives for consumers , farmers and businesses , questioning whether Kansas MD effectively lessen DT problem . But some of them doubt PRP 's a problem compelling enough to address and express opinions at odds with most NNS ' views . “ DT NN goes in cycles , and it's a natural cycle , "" VBD House Majority Leader Dan Hawkins , a Wichita Republican . “ PRP VBP IN DT globe is VBG . And guess what ? If PRP VBP back through history , PRP did , and then PRP cools down , and then PRP warms and then PRP cools down . ” Rabbi Moti Rieber , executive director of DT Kansas Interfaith Alliance , VBD lawmakers have avoided tackling NN NN in recent NNS "" as DT situation continues to VB worse . "" Of DT 71 billion - dollar natural disasters DT federal NN says have affected Kansas over DT past 40 NNS , more than half , or 37 , occurred in DT past decade , even with damage figures adjusted for inflation . “ PRP 's frustrating beyond belief , "" Rieber VBD during DT hearing on DT bill dealing with plastic bags . "" PRP 're fiddling while DT NN burns . ” Oil and natural gas production remain an important industry in Kansas , but PRP 's RB made big strides on clean NN because of a wind - farm boom over DT past decade . Wind is generating close to 40 % of DT NN 's power , only a little less than coal - fired plants do , according to DT U.S. NNP Information Administration . Two decades ago , coal - fired plants generated more than 70 % . And carbon dioxide NNS in 2017 were 12 % lower than PRP were in 1980 , according to federal statistics . But Sierra Club lobbyist Zack Pistora VBD Kansas MD eventually VB all of its electricity from renewable resources because its use of solar now is minimal . Virginia lawmakers are working on legislation to meet such a goal by 2050 , while a 2018 California a law sets DT marker for 2045 . “ If PRP do n't recognize IN PRP need to do something about this , I feel IN DT costs are just VBG to VB greater , ” Pistora VBD . Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly is concentrating on making DT NN 's NN policy office independent of DT commission WDT regulates utilities , arguing IN a separate agency MD be better able to draft a long - term NN plan . She issued an executive order last month , but a House committee recommended its rejection by DT full chamber , which MD block DT move . Kelly 's chief of staff , Will Lawrence , told a Senate committee this week IN Kelly is pursuing an “ all of DT above ” NN strategy and sees NN as “ JJ development . ” “ NNS feel DT discussion of NN NN will be taking away things from NNS when PRP really VBP to concentrate on , how can PRP best adapt to what 's happening ; how can PRP be positive ? "" VBD Francisco , whose northeast Kansas district includes DT liberal University of Kansas campus . DT leaders of DT House and Senate utilities committees VBD DT potential costs of initiatives versus their potential benefits is a key issue . PRP VBD PRP do n't VB to take steps WDT , for example , increase DT costs of farmers ' tractors by tens of thousands of dollars for small improvements in pollution controls . “ Kansans are RB very practical , ” VBD Senate Utilities Committee Chairman Ty Masterson , a Wichita - area Republican . “ PRP VBP to do something WDT makes JJ sense to them . ” And Senate NNP Susan Wagle , a Wichita Republican , questioned whether PRP 's practical for Kansas to pursue NN NN as an issue without NNS reductions by foreign nations . Wagle is a candidate for DT U.S. Senate and recently criticized a JJ GOP congressional NN plan , arguing IN PRP is “ kind of silly ” to propose spending “ a lot of taxpayer dollars ” when NNP 's and India 's greenhouse gas NNS MD more than cancel out any benefits . “ I believe DT NN is changing , but I do n't see scientific consensus on , an agreement on , what DT cause factors are or DT resolution , ” Wagle VBD . “ As long as EX is not agreement in DT scientific community and among all DT major nations for what should be done , PRP 's all for naught .

Transcription_NN by_IN Linda_NNP Leblanc_NNP ,_, with_IN formal_JJ corrections_NNS of_IN the_DT Interview_NN from_IN April_NNP 9_CD ,_, 2019_CD","ER Editor : PRP draw DT reader ’s attention to a piece PRP published by Prof. Claudia von Werlhof from 2 NNS ago titled DT NNP Is Not VBG Up But Drying Out ! Professor Claudia von Werlhof wrote to Greta Thunberg . ( see featured image ) In this letter Von Werlhof says IN DT disruption of DT JJ NN is not due to CO2 . Questions arose from this letter for Silvia Terribili , who asked von Werlhof to give an interview for her radio show Onda Italiana on salto.nl , April 9th . Below is DT transcript of DT interview . Claudia Von Werlhof : DT question is how PRP define NN NN and its alleged reason , of which PRP is VBN PRP is CO2 . PRP consider NN NN , at least in DT official discussion , as “ JJ NN ” and this JJ NN does n’t exist . EX are data from NASA , which is DT North American Space Agency , and PRP show IN in DT last 18 NNS EX was no general JJ NN . What exist indeed – because PRP are not deniers of DT problem – are changes in different dimensions in DT weather , in DT NN and more so in DT atmosphere , etc . PRP are VBG to explain this more in this interview . DT second is DT CO2 - question , which is now very prominent as all these young NNS are now on DT street because PRP believe in this story and this dogma of DT CO2 . And this is very strange because a lot of NNS , real NNS , are denying DT influence of CO2 as a reason for NN NN or as an influence at all . For example , EX are about 30,000 NNS in DT NNP now who say IN EX is no problem with CO2 . PRP say IN CO2 is not at all detrimental for DT NN , and IN PRP even is something PRP are to welcome and IN PRP need for our trees and plants and as a positive effect . So , DT funny thing is IN CO2 is often shown as some dirt , as if PRP was a dirt in DT air . Then PRP look at DT factories WDT are shown in this opportunity , PRP see DT dust coming out of them , etc . This is not CO2 . CO2 is a gas WDT is invisible and does n’t smell , so PRP do n’t see PRP . In general , DT amount of CO2 in DT atmosphere is about . Most of DT is vapour , NN vapour , some 80 or 70 % . So , all these NNS who are serious NNS , are denying a negative influence of CO2 on DT NN . EX are even winners of DT Nobel Prize etc. , IN Ivar Giaever , who are explaining PRP or NNS from DT MIT , DT Massachusetts Institute of Technology , IN Richard Lindzen and others . DT IPCC , DT International Panel on NNP NNP , founded at DT end of DT ’ 80s of DT last century , however , is not so much a scientific but a political organization , and PRP is propagating and proposing DT CO2 myth to DT NN . So , this is a political question , and from DT point of view of a real scientist , CO2 is not really something detrimental and is not changing any NN . PRP ’s too tiny for DT . If PRP look at DT origins of this debate at DT end of DT ‘ 80s , PRP see IN before this NN all DT NN spoke about a possible NN age , a JJ NN age . Lowell Ponte , f.i. , wrote a book on “ DT Cooling ” . PRP was in 1976 . PRP spoke about a cooling and a JJ NN age in contrast to DT JJ NN - speech of today . EX is no historical debate any more about how this myth about CO2 came about . DT IPCC was founded by NNP Tanks IN DT Club of Rome , DT NNP Watch Institute , DT Rockefellers , etc. , NNS who have a different interest in DT whole question . And PRP found , I VBP PRP was an analysis by William Engdahl , who VBD PRP found or invented DT myth of CO2 in order to have a common enemy defined which is humanity itself . Humanity is guilty of producing so much CO2 by civil industry and consumption . This ideology can be used for another , a JJ policy . So , this was DT origin of DT CO2 myth and this has been their propaganda worldwide . Then came Al Gore and everybody believes in him . This is contrasting with DT fact IN This history is generally not known . And NNS do n’t really VB anything about Nature and DT NNP . EX is a certain ignorance generally , and EX are a lot of changes in DT NN , in DT NN , in JJ aspects , IN those Dr. Rosalie Bertell found out , PRP ’ll speak about her later , who VBD PRP are wrecking our NN . But how ? PRP ’s not by JJ NN , but by something totally different . This is not mentioned by these NNS who speak about NN NN . PRP do n’t see IN EX are changes , but EX are different ones with very different origins . Silvia Terribili : Yes , PRP seems RB IN computer models predicting catastrophic JJ NN in DT coming NNS are parameterized , and EX is a risk of framing DT outcome of these methods and models . Can PRP say something about these models ? CvW : These models DT IPCC is using are computer models . Their results are just an outcome of computer simulation . PRP has nothing to do with reality , and what PRP are measuring is what PRP VBP to measure . PRP just measure something IN more CO2 - output , but PRP do not consider DT complexity of DT NN on this NN . PRP have no parameters about them and so PRP are really trying to fool PRP with what PRP are saying about such a big amount of NN NN and JJ NN . This is not happening , and PRP will not happen because of CO2 . So , these are strange methods , and not scientific ones . PRP should say PRP are political methods which VBP to prove something which is not DT case . So , EX is no reason why EX should be such an amount of JJ NN of above 4 degrees , which is impossible . At least PRP is impossible with simply putting CO2 as a measure of this tiny amount of CO2 in DT air . PRP MD never have any effect , and PRP is very funny IN everybody is believing this nonsense . PRP ’s a theory , but PRP has nothing to do with reality , and PRP should look at why this theory exists . So , this is DT more important question . ST : Some 30 NNS ago PRP were being warned IN DT protective ozone layer had been reduced . Nowadays PRP do n’t seem to care anymore about ozone depletion in DT stratosphere . How MD this be explained because PRP have to be concerned about DT depletion of DT ozone layer and where PRP comes from . CvW : DT ozone question , yes . This is a very funny thing again , and PRP is not funny at all in DT end because DT ozone layer is really something WDT PRP need . Without DT ozone layer EX MD be no life on NN , because PRP protects PRP from cosmic radiation from DT sun , especially UV - B and - C radiation , which is very toxic . And PRP has been found IN this radiation today is coming down to NN , which normally is prevented by DT ozone layer . But now PRP comes through , and this is a long story because EX was DT Montreal Protocol in DT ‘ 80s which prohibited DT use of CFCs , all these chemicals PRP have in DT refrigerators , etc. , because PRP thought PRP was DT reason for DT ozone hole . But this was already wrong then because PRP VBP IN what was really damaging DT ozone was particularly radioactivity . Of radioactivity , EX has been a lot in DT air since DT military had been experimenting with nuclear explosions from DT ‘ 40s and ‘ 50s until DT end of DT ‘ 90s , and PRP had about 2,200 nuclear explosions on NN and in DT atmosphere , and This is DT main reason for DT weakness of this layer because radioactivity is somehow eating up DT ozone so IN PRP is suffocating in a way , because ozone is a sort of atmospheric oxygen and radioactivity finishes DT oxygen . DT problem is something IN suffocation , and DT toxic effect of radiation coming down to NN when this layer is destroyed or inhibited . Last NN , DT NNS who were measuring DT ozone layer found IN PRP was weaker than ever ; PRP did not recover as was proposed after DT Montreal Protocol . And PRP found out IN , on DT contrary , PRP is not only existing in DT form of holes over DT Antarctic and DT Arctic – DT latter CD existing only since Fukushima , as EX was never a hole over DT Arctic before . And now PRP have ozone depletion even over DT whole northern part of DT NN . So , DT toxic radiation is not only occurring at DT poles but generally PRP comes down and PRP is destroying a lot of plants and lower animal life , IN insects . With DT insects dying , DT birds and DT whole food chain is affected by DT weakness of DT ozone layer , and in DT oceans DT plankton is dying and DT krill WDT DT big fish are eating . PRP have now JJ fish who are dying from hunger and PRP have dying coral reefs IN , for example , DT Great Barrier Reef east of NNP Zealand , DT biggest NN in DT NN , which is now dying , and PRP is almost not reproducing itself anymore . NNS say PRP is because DT oceans are VBG up , but this can not be DT real reason . DT main problem is IN DT toxic radiation from DT sun comes down into DT NN as well , and PRP is killing life in DT oceans . And then PRP have all this radioactivity from Fukushima which has been led into DT Pacific so IN life in DT Pacific is dying out , and soon PRP will have no fish anymore . This is somehow very tragic because Rosalie Bertell wrote her book “ NNP NNP , DT Latest Weapon of War ” already in 2000 . She has studied all these problems , and where PRP come from , and she always warned about DT ozone layer , And she VBD IN with a 20 % thinning of DT ozone layer EX will be no agriculture anymore , because DT plants will be destroyed by DT toxicity of UV radiation . PRP can see PRP even on your balcony when PRP have your plants out RB . PRP can already be seen IN DT leaves are getting brown and your plants are not growing much in DT sun . So , this is maybe DT biggest problem PRP are facing and DT result of JJ , JJ effects which are destroying DT ozone layer not only with DT radioactivity , but RB other instruments and technologies worse than any CO2 or JJ NN . ST : What can PRP say about geoengineering and especially Stratospheric Aerosol Injection which is CD of DT technologies WDT DT IPCC is in a way not suggesting , but PRP say PRP can be a solution for DT JJ NN . What do PRP VB ? CvW : Well , because of this NN theory of JJ NN and CO2 , PRP now have civil geoengineers appearing , something WDT did n’t exist in previous times . Now PRP have their research institutes everywhere , and plan to have a solution to this problem which is supposed to be “ solar radiation management ” SRM or SAI , with which PRP are planning to inject aerosols into DT air to block DT sun from shining and from heating up DT NN . So , instead of removing CO2 , because PRP seems impossible politically , PRP are promoting this other solution to fight against DT effects of so - called JJ NN , and this MD mean blocking DT sun from shining too much on NN . So , DT plan is to inject aerosols into DT atmosphere , and especially David Keith from Harvard University has a project called SCOPEX for this very process . In this project he wants to inject even sulphuric acid into DT atmosphere imitating something IN a volcanic eruption , which PRP call DT Pinatubo effect because DT Pinatubo is a volcano WDT exploded in 1991 and DT ashes and what came out had DT effect of cooling down DT temperatures . And now PRP are trying to imitate this effect by adding sulphuric acid into DT air . Recently David Keith , this professor from Harvard University , even VBD IN tens of thousands of NNS MD die from DT at least , because PRP MD mean having acids rain down on NN , which MD eventually destroy all life . I mean , these are crazy experiments PRP are preparing , and PRP VBP for civil geoengineers and DT funniest thing about this movement of civil geoengineers is IN PRP do not speak of DT military background of all these technologies PRP are now propagating . And all these movements about NN NN , etc. , do n’t VB anything about PRP as well . PRP is simply denied IN these are military experiments which PRP VBP already , becauseI mean something IN SRM is nothing JJ . PRP have PRP already in DT form of DT spraying of barium and aluminium and other substances WDT are very bad for all life and agriculture . Monsanto for example invented a seed WDT is resistant to aluminium , imagine . So , things IN DT are occurring and DT NNS are against PRP , but PRP do n’t see IN these experiments are a reality already , being a part of geoengineering , military geoengineering , WDT has existed now for about 70 or more NNS . This has been a project of DT Second NNP War in which DT military invented DT nuclear as a weapon of war and after DT nuclear , PRP invented other weapons IN those of weather control . As Rosalie Bertell VBD , PRP invented weather wars , PRP invented geoengineering and PRP invented plasma weapons which are electromagnetic weapons used by and emitted by ionospheric heaters . This is a very special technology mostly not known about , which is based on DT inventions of Nicola Tesla , who was a physicist inventor in DT 19th and 20th century . So , this is a special technology which is not very well known , likein Alaska ( now closed down ) which is CD of these ionospheric heaters WDT are working with electromagnetic waves . This is a very , very dangerous technology which can RB be used for producing all kinds of so - called natural catastrophes IN , for example , tsunamis or earthquakes , volcanic eruptions or DT NN of DT weather in whole regions , or producing hurricanes , droughts , fires and floods , and even changing DT ocean currents . These are technologies WDT are not discussed in NN but have existed since DT Vietnam War . PRP have been invented during this NN and DT UN Convention on Environmental Modification , DT famous ENMOD convention from 1977 , explains these weapons , PRP explains DT effects PRP MD have when PRP are used . So , PRP is not even a secret and PRP is decades ago IN PRP were invented and were in experimentation , and PRP is IN a war WDT is fought against DT NN and DT NN as a cosmic macro - being on which PRP depend . This is very , very dangerous and PRP is exactly Rosalie Bertell who has explained to PRP how these technologies function , namely as DT post - nuclear weapons of electromagnetic mass destruction . PRP have these ionospheric heaters now everywhere . ST : What is DT ionospheric heater ? What is PRP , why do PRP use PRP ? What is DT idea ? PRP do n’t understand because EX is JJ NN , PRP VBD IN EX is a JJ NN . So , PRP are heating DT ionosphere , but DT ’s crazy . CvW : PRP are heating up DT ionosphere , DT sphere in DT atmosphere WDT starts at about 80 kilometres up to about 800 - 1,000 kilometres . PRP is an electrified part of DT atmosphere and when PRP send DT electromagnetic waves up RB , PRP are heating PRP up because when PRP heat DT ionosphere , this part of DT atmosphere , PRP can manage these electromagnetic rays so IN PRP come down on NN again , by making a curve . PRP can work with an angle and , IN Rosalie VBD , These rays can even pass through DT core of DT NN . ST : But PRP is RB VBG , so PRP is completely crazy because PRP have too much NN and PRP are sending some … CvW : Because DT NN is up RB . PRP ’s not down here . If EX is any NN , PRP is up RB . DT NASA did n’t find a real NN of DT NN in general , but PRP have different parts of DT NN WDT are VBG up or have been warmed up IN DT poles , DT polar regions and DT mountains where DT melting glaciers are , but PRP has nothing to do with a general JJ NN through CO2 . Some of them are surely effects of DT military use of ionospheric heaters . For example , in 1974 EX was a treaty between DT NNP and DT Soviet Union , DT secret Vladivostok Agreement in which PRP planned together to heat up DT Arctic because PRP wanted DT NN to VB away to VB to DT oil on DT floor of DT northern NN , and PRP MD n’t VB RB because of DT NN . Today , half of DT Arctic NN has melted down already , because PRP used electromagnetic waves for DT . ELF waves , WDT are extremely low frequency waves and PRP have thawed DT Arctic with DT . PRP has nothing to do with JJ NN but with this military technology . ST : VBG back to geoengineering , DT solar radiation management , do PRP have evidence IN DT program is on ? I mean , PRP see all kinds of trails in DT sky , and DT sky is completely sometimes completely covered by these trails . PRP are persistent , staying DT whole NN . What do PRP VB about DT phenomenon ? CvW : PRP is an older military technology which has been implemented for about 30 NNS . This started in DT ‘ 90s and , for example , PRP have effects in regions IN Shasta in California . PRP have been heavily sprayed with aerosols . PRP ’s IN Agent Orange WDT was sprayed on Vietnam , a toxic product from Monsanto and PRP ’s IN DT . PRP ’s toxic and , for example , in this community of Shasta in Northern California , DT land is not producing anymore , everybody is sick , and DT animals and plants are dying . PRP had such a load of toxic materials , aerosols coming down from DT sky WDT PRP got these problems , and after having analysed them , PRP made a big event some NNS ago to protest publicly against DT sprayings . Nevertheless , DT alternative and social movements do not accept – even ETC Group , which is very important in DT respect – IN this has been done , which is a reality for DT NNS affected , and PRP are denying IN SRM is already being used and discussing only DT bad effects which this method MD have on PRP . So , PRP are against PRP , but PRP are denying IN these methods are in use already everywhere . Of course , PRP see PRP in DT sky , and I have done some research about why PRP are doing PRP , as DT military is not interested in any JJ NN myth . PRP are even denying JJ NN because PRP VBP better . ST : So , PRP are doing DT ? CvW : Yes , PRP are doing DT , so PRP VBP better , IN NNP , who knows PRP from DT military . But I found out IN PRP are not interested in DT JJ NN question or so . PRP are doing PRP because of DT ozone depletion , f.i . If EX is an ozone hole or weakness , PRP cannot pass their electromagnetic waves . PRP need what I call a replacement atmosphere . PRP need to spray aerosols as a conductor , PRP need an atmosphere WDT is conductive , and at DT holes PRP is not . This is DT reason why PRP are using so JJ metals in DT spraying , heavy metals IN barium and strontium and aluminium , which is not a heavy metal , but PRP are all conductive for electromagnetic waves . Recently I came across some research by a woman called Schmitt who lives in Venezuela . She made an analysis of these sprayings as being protective against DT cosmos , something IN a Faraday cage , producing a sort of grid around DT NN to protect PRP from radiation coming in and this RB has to do with DT ozone depletion . DT ozone layer is really DT central question WDT has to be an alarm for PRP , because this is now DT moment of truth . When PRP are not able to prevent these things happening , this destruction happening , PRP will die out within 20 or 30 NNS . ST : But DT official story , nobody is telling , talking about DT ozone depletion . CvW : No . EX was an alarm last NN and EX was a colleague in DT NNP , Marvin Herndon , who was doing research about DT question , together with his colleagues and he published PRP . He proved IN ozone depletion leads to DT arrival of toxic radiation down on NN . And he found out IN NASA , DT North American Space Agency , had already come to DT same result in 2007 . And PRP did n’t do anything . PRP already knew PRP then , but PRP did n’t do anything because DT military thinks PRP can do everything PRP wants . If PRP need PRP , PRP MD invent a JJ ozone layer . This is what PRP VBP . PRP VBP PRP have … CvW : Yes , and PRP VBP IN PRP can do whatever PRP VBP to do and prevent things from happening . But after all these nuclear explosions in DT atmosphere and in DT ionosphere and in DT Van Allen belts , which destroyed parts of DT magnetic field of DT NN , PRP MD never replace or cure DT magnetic field nor DT atmosphere . PRP MD n’t do anything about PRP . PRP destroyed PRP and PRP is destroyed . This is CD of DT reasons for weather changes as well . So , EX are a lot of very complex reasons as to why things are happening . For example , PRP can even use electromagnetic waves from DT ionospheric heaters in order to move DT jet stream , which consists of fast winds surrounding DT NN , building a frontier between hot and cold . So , if PRP are moving them north , PRP have DT heat from DT south in DT north , and when PRP are moving them down south , PRP have DT cold from DT Arctic in DT middle of Europe … ST : PRP strongly influence DT NN and DT weather CvW : With these technologies , PRP can do nearly everything , and PRP can VB DT vapour streams WDT are DT humid streams around DT NN . PRP can transport humidity to Arabia for example . This is CD of DT biggest businesses today , because DT NNS RB need NN and PRP can just transport DT NN from here to RB . So , even snow is coming down in DT South Arabian desert . This is all manipulation , weather manipulation , NN manipulation . Nobody speaks about PRP , but PRP is occurring constantly . And another effect of DT atmosphere being full of metal is IN PRP is drying out , so PRP have much less rain in Europe , for example , which has nothing to do with NN or CO2 . ST : In Italy EX is drought . CVW : Italy is drying out , and then PRP have fires which are RB induced , not only because PRP is dry , but PRP have directed NN weapons and laser weapons . So , PRP can produce these fires WDT were happening in Portugal and Australia and in California . PRP have nothing to do with wildfires , and PRP are not destroying DT plants , but . PRP is IN a war WDT has passed through . All these things are discussed as being a result of JJ NN and CO2 . PRP has nothing to do with DT . , so IN PRP do n’t see what has been done to DT NN and to DT atmosphere and to DT weather , etc. , so PRP MD n’t look at PRP because PRP VBP PRP is all JJ NN . ST : Unfortunately , PRP have almost to close DT program , but I MD VB to ask PRP something again . On NNP 23 – 26 , PRP will have European elections coming . What can PRP do as concerned Europeans to put NN engineering and all related risks on DT electoral agenda because PRP expect European institutions to protect DT 500 million citizens from DT risks of these extremely dangerous technologies . What can PRP do ? CvW : What PRP did , inform DT NNS . PRP are just now publishing a book . PRP is called “ JJ Warning ! ” , not NN , but warning . PRP is VBG to appear soon . Ten women are explaining their research of what PRP are talking about now , and this will be published by Talma Studies International in Dublin . So , I can recommend PRP . DT problem is IN NNS do n’t VB anything about what is happening around them , and PRP do n’t VB informed even if this is possible . DT book of Rosalie Bertell exists in DT 4th edition in German , PRP exists in Italian , French and Spanish . Everybody can read PRP and JJ NNS have ordered DT 4th edition now , PRP has been printed 15,000 times . Somebody should have read PRP , but NNS do n’t speak about PRP . DT parties WDT are running for election have nothing to do with all this . DT Greens should be DT most interested in this question , but PRP are not . PRP have to look behind DT NN NN agenda . EX must be somebody who wants NNS to be distracted , to be organized around other issues . PRP have DT whole Smart City and 5G movement , DT technification of DT society and a sort of policies of controlled reduction of production and consumption . PRP is IN DT depopulation agenda of certain NNS which seems to be related to DT . I VBP IN EX are other political plans , DT NNP NNP Order and interests behind PRP . CO2 is only DT scapegoat to prevent NNS from looking at them . DT Greens for example are totally involved in these plans for a so called “ green ” economy , but this is not DT case . PRP is not a green economy . PRP is a weaponized economy which PRP see is approaching PRP . I do n’t see DT Left , PRP has no interest in DT whole question because PRP is concerned about progress and development , to put PRP IN DT . PRP need a critique of these technologies . I call PRP military alchemy , what PRP have now . But DT Left is not interested in DT and DT other parties in any case not at all as well . So , I do n’t VB who is VBG to be interested from DT point of view of DT parties . NNS are not informed and PRP do n’t VB informed , and NNS who speak about PRP are called NN theorists , etc . How to VB DT to VB , DT NN from believing in these ideologies from above in order to see what is happening in reality ? How can NNS VB this ( ER : pictured with an employee of George Soros ) and DT young NNS VB informed about DT reality ? PRP should VB what is really VBG on and not what is supposed to be VBG on . This is DT problem . PRP is why I wrote DT letter to Greta Thunberg , to VB her informed , and as I VBP she even recognized ultimately IN EX is a military problem but not DT NN PRP are discussing , DT of ST : Did she answer PRP ? CvW : No , of course not . Because EX is a big movement behind her , DT CO2 movement is behind her , of course . EX have been plans : 7 NNS ago , PRP was already being discussed how to mobilize DT youth . This is not just a venture of DT NNS but an organized campaign of DT other side . ST : Claudia , PRP have to stop unfortunately , but PRP will present your book when PRP is VBG to come out and maybe PRP can present DT book of Rosalie Bertell CD more NN because our task is to inform NNS . PRP do what PRP can to inform NNS . CvW : Maybe PRP can translate PRP for Italy and DT Netherlands . ST : Yes , unfortunately , I have to stop but I thank PRP very much for being with PRP this evening and I hope to speak to PRP again .

This was demonstrated more than 40 NNS ago in a series of pioneering psychological experiments conducted in DT Netherlands by Willem Wagenaar and his colleagues . In CD NN , participants were shown a hypothetical index of air pollution beginning in 1970 at a low value of 3 and rising yearly in an exponential way to 7 , 20 , 55 and , finally , 148 by 1974 . Asked to intuitively predict DT index value for 1979 , JJ of DT respondents produced estimates at or below 10 percent of DT correct value of about 21,000 ( which can be determined from DT underlying exponential equation ) . Subsequent experiments have observed similarly dramatic underestimation of exponential growth and showed IN PRP typically results from straight - line projections based on early small increases . DT deceptive nature of exponential growth is similarly conveyed by DT riddle of a single lily pad in a pond . Suppose each member of this species reproduces once a day so IN on DT second day EX are two lily pads , on DT third day EX are four , on DT fourth day EX are eight , etc . On Day 48 , DT pond is covered completely . How long did PRP take to be covered halfway ? DT answer is 47 days . Moreover , even after 40 days of exponential growth , PRP MD barely VB DT lily pads are RB , as PRP MD cover only 1/256th ( 0.4 percent ) of DT pond at DT NN . For a period of NN , PRP can easily ignore DT steady exponential growth of lily pads — until PRP smother DT pond . With respect to DT NN , DT initial doubling of DT relatively small numbers of infected NNS and deaths evoked little concern outside NNP in January and most of February , since , for weeks , NNS around DT NN had little or no personal exposure to DT NN or its victims . But DT deceptively mild and seemingly faraway beginnings of DT current pandemic led NN officials and governments to squander JJ opportunities for early intervention . As a result , in DT past few weeks , DT numbers have quickly become a torrent overwhelming our capacity to stop DT NN ’ spread and care for DT victims . PRP took 67 days to reach 100,000 NN NNS worldwide . DT second 100,000 NNS took 11 days , and DT third 100,000 took only four days . JJ - NN authorities are now scrambling to communicate just how steep and damaging DT NN growth curve has or MD become , and urgent response is becoming DT law of DT land . Aside from DT NN pandemic , DT biggest , most destructive exponential growth processes WDT PRP must grapple with today are those associated with JJ NN NN . While PRP might be hard for humans to detect IN carbon NNS and their concentration in DT atmosphere are growing exponentially right now , DT does n’t mean PRP should rest easy . DT opposite is true . As with DT NN , PRP need to anticipate DT NN crisis and act quickly and aggressively to minimize further damages before PRP overwhelm PRP . NNS have long recognized IN carbon dioxide NNS and their resulting effects have been increasing exponentially . Figure 1 shows DT monthly average carbon dioxide concentration measured at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii — DT longest record of direct measurements of CO in DT atmosphere . DT volume of CO stood at 315 parts per million ( ppm ) when first measured in 1958 ; by DT end of February 2020 , PRP had risen by 31 percent to 414 ppm ."

Blue Lake , CD of DT largest lakes on North Stradbroke Island , southeast of Brisbane , has been DT focus of research examining DT lake ’s response to environmental NN over NN . Researchers studied DT lake ’s NN discharge , NN quality and comparisons of historical photos over DT past 117 NNS , as well as fossil pollen and algae to better understand its history over DT past 7500 NNS . DT results , published online in DT journal Freshwater Biology , show IN Blue Lake has remained relatively stable and resilient for millennia . “ Blue Lake is CD of those rare , beautiful lakes in Australia . PRP ’s unusual because PRP ’s more than 10 metres deep but PRP ’s so clear PRP can see to DT bottom , ” says DT lead author of DT NN , Dr Cameron Barr from DT University ’s Discipline of Geography , Environment and Population . “ PRP did n’t realize just how unique and unusual this lake is until PRP started looking at a wide range of environmental markers . “ PRP VBP IN EX have been variations in NN in DT region including North Stradbroke Island over recent decades , but during DT NN DT depth , shoreline and NN chemistry of Blue Lake has displayed little variation . “ PRP RB VBP IN DT region experienced a significant shift towards a drier NN around 4000 NNS ago . Again , Blue Lake has demonstrated little variation over this period . This is in stark contrast to other changes in DT region due to shifts in NN . “ PRP appears IN Blue Lake has been an important NN ‘ refuge ’ for DT freshwater biota of DT region , and is in DT same condition now as PRP was 7500 NNS ago . With appropriate management , DT lake MD continue relatively unchanged for hundreds , possibly thousands of NNS to come , ” Dr Barr says . Project leader and co-author Dr John Tibby , RB from DT University of Adelaide , says DT results of this research MD affect decision making about utilising DT freshwater aquifer of North Stradbroke Island as a source of fresh NN for DT mainland . “ Our NN suggests IN increased extraction of ground NN represents CD of DT few obvious threats to DT stability of Blue Lake . DT threat this MD pose to DT lake ’s status as a stable freshwater refuge needs serious consideration if DT regional aquifer of North Stradbroke Island is to be contemplated , ” Dr Tibby says .

DT ISLAND THAT’S CD OF NN ’S MOST IMPORTANT WETLANDS North Stradbroke Island lies 18 miles off DT coast of Brisbane – and its lakes are classed as CD of DT NN ’s most ecologically important wetlands . As well as Blue Lake , DT waterways include Brown Lake , DT Keyholes , Eighteen Mile Swamp and some small lagoons .

DT demise of DT NNP auto giant General Motors Corporation , by itself , is a catastrophic mark upon America , especially in light of its having armed and equipped DT NNP Military through two NNP Wars , raised millions of citizens into DT middle class and at its height employed nearly 350,000 workers in 150 assembly plants supporting over 2 million others in associated parts plants , dealerships and banking . But , to DT worst fate of DT 101 - NN - old institution of American industrial might is IN with its bankruptcy PRP has now fallen under DT control of DT NNP NN in an JJ scheme based on a failed Marxist ideology WDT those few who are left WDT remember America in during her greatest hours VBP all too well spells DT doom of their country . Even worse , today RB marks DT day IN DT NNP NNPS is slamming shut its borders against all outsiders in what CD Canadian official stated was a “ heightened militarization ” of DT NNP and will see its citizens for DT first NN in their history being forced to present NN identification passports to reenter their own country from their North American neighbors Canada and Mexico . As PRP have long tried to warn these NNS of DT catastrophic dangers facing them , DT events PRP have foretold to them for NNS are now being set to be poured upon these hapless Americans , who even while PRP cry in anguish at their demise , PRP can never say PRP were n’t warned , only IN PRP did n’t listen . And from our JJ reports over DT NNS based on their own NN ’s dire predictions on any Nations ability to survive this century , DT NN most ignored by these Americans is DT chilling report from their own Pentagon WDT DT London Observer published and says in part : “ A secret report , suppressed by NNP defence chiefs and obtained by DT Observer , warns IN major European cities will be sunk beneath rising seas as Britain is plunged into a ' Siberian ' NN by 2020 . Nuclear conflict , mega - droughts , famine and widespread rioting will erupt across DT NN . DT document predicts IN abrupt NN NN MD bring DT NN to DT edge of anarchy as NNS develop a nuclear threat to defend and secure dwindling food , NN and NN supplies . DT threat to JJ stability vastly eclipses DT of terrorism , say DT few experts privy to its contents . Disruption and conflict will be endemic features of life , ' concludes DT Pentagon analysis . “ Once again , warfare MD define human life . ” Not surprisingly , DT American NNS continue to ignore DT facts WDT have led to DT destruction of their Nation , and even to this day PRP continue believing DT lies heaped upon them by their celebrity driven propaganda NN , all DT while never wondering what are DT true reasons why over $ 25 Trillion of their personal savings and home values and all of DT job gains for DT past decade have been wiped out in less than six months . This cannot be VBN , however , of their elite classes and NN oligarchs , who even as PRP watch their own fellow citizens plunge into DT abyss of mass starvation , homelessness , anarchy and Total NNP War , PRP have set their Nation upon a course of confrontation with an entire NN just as desperate as PRP are to survive what can only be described as an apocalyptic future where who lives and who dies will be determined by violence , not cooperation . And , how far these American NNS have actually fallen is , perhaps , best summarized by DT Russian writer Stanislav Mishin who recently wrote : “ First , DT population was dumbed down through a politicized and substandard education system based on pop culture , rather then DT classics . Americans VBP more about their favorite TV dramas then DT drama in DC WDT directly affects their lives . PRP care more for their "" right "" to choke down a McDonalds burger or a Burger King burger than for their constitutional rights . Then PRP turn around and lecture PRP about our rights and about our "" democracy "" . Pride blind DT foolish . Then their faith in God was destroyed , until their churches , all tens of thousands of different "" branches and denominations "" were for DT most part little more then Sunday circuses and their televangelists and top protestant mega preachers were more then happy to sell out their souls and flocks to be on DT "" winning "" side of CD pseudo Marxist politician or another . Their flocks MD complain , but when explained IN PRP MD be on DT "" winning "" side , their flocks were ever so quick to reject Christ in hopes for earthly power . Even our Holy Orthodox churches are scandalously liberalized in America . DT final collapse has come with DT election of Barack Obama . His speed in DT past three months has been truly impressive . His spending and money printing has been a record setting , not just in America 's short history but in DT NN . If this keeps up for more then another NN , and EX is no sign IN PRP will not , America at best will resemble DT Wiemar Republic and at worst Zimbabwe . These past two weeks have been DT most breath taking of all . First came DT announcement of a planned redesign of DT American Byzantine tax system , by DT very thieves who used PRP to bankroll their thefts , loses and swindles of hundreds of billions of dollars . These make our Russian oligarchs look little more then ordinary street thugs , in comparison . Yes , DT Americans have beat our own thieves in DT shear volumes . Should PRP congratulate them ? ” PRP was once quipped on an American television show , “ George Washington had a vision for this country . Was PRP three days of uninterrupted shopping ? ” ; sadly this is what these once great NNS became , all DT while living their lives never bothering to read what their great founding father had really envisioned for them and warned them about … “ NN is not reason ; PRP is not eloquent ; PRP is force .

DT nature of DT evidence for NN NN is explained , as are DT principal mechanisms WDT have caused NN NN throughout DT history of NNP . Finally , a detailed description is given of NN NN over JJ different timescales , ranging from a typical human life span to all of geologic NN . For a detailed description of DT development of NNP ’s atmosphere , see DT article atmosphere , evolution of . For full treatment of DT most critical issue of NN NN in DT contemporary NN , see JJ NN . NN is often defined loosely as DT average weather at a particular place , incorporating such features as temperature , precipitation , humidity , and windiness . A more specific definition MD VB IN NN is DT mean NN and variability of these features over some extended NN period . Both definitions acknowledge IN DT weather is always changing , owing to instabilities in DT atmosphere . And as weather varies from day to day , so too does NN vary , from daily day - and - night cycles up to periods of geologic NN hundreds of millions of NNS long . In a very real sense , NN variation is a redundant expression — NN is always varying . No two NNS are exactly alike , nor are any two decades , any two centuries , or any two millennia . DT atmosphere is a dynamic fluid WDT is continually in motion . Both its physical properties and its rate and direction of motion are influenced by a variety of factors , including solar radiation , DT geographic position of continents , ocean currents , DT location and orientation of mountain ranges , atmospheric chemistry , and vegetation growing on DT land surface . All these factors VBP through NN . Some factors , such as DT distribution of heat within DT oceans , atmospheric chemistry , and surface vegetation , VB at very short timescales . Others , such as DT position of continents and DT location and height of mountain ranges , VBP over very long timescales . Therefore , NN , which results from DT physical properties and motion of DT atmosphere , varies at every conceivable timescale . A series of photographs of DT Grinnell Glacier taken from DT summit of Mount Gould in Glacier National Park , Montana , in 1938 , 1981 , 1998 , and 2006 ( from left to right ) . In 1938 DT Grinnell Glacier filled DT entire area at DT bottom of DT image . By 2006 PRP had largely disappeared from this view . NN NN , periodic modification of NNP ’s NN brought about as a result of changes in DT atmosphere as well as interactions between DT atmosphere and various other geologic , chemical , biological , and geographic factors within DT NNP system . DT atmosphere is influenced by and linked to other features of NNP , including oceans , NN masses ( glaciers and NN NN ) , land surfaces , and vegetation . Together , PRP make up an integrated NNP system , in which all components interact with and influence CD another in often complex ways . For instance , NN influences DT distribution of vegetation on NNP ’s surface ( e.g. , deserts exist in arid regions , forests in humid regions ) , but vegetation in turn influences NN by reflecting radiant NN back into DT atmosphere , transferring NN ( and latent heat ) from soil to DT atmosphere , and influencing DT horizontal movement of air across DT land surface . • None iceberg Tourist boat in front of a massive iceberg near DT coast of Greenland . • None Turkmenistan Drought - resistant plants grow in DT Repetek Preserve in DT southeastern Karakum Desert , Turkmenistan . NNP NNS and atmospheric NNS are still seeking a full understanding of DT complex feedbacks and interactions among DT various components of DT NNP system . This effort is being facilitated by DT development of an interdisciplinary NN called NNP system NN . NN system NN is composed of a wide range of disciplines , including climatology ( DT NN of DT atmosphere ) , geology ( DT NN of NNP ’s surface and underground processes ) , ecology ( DT NN of how NNP ’s organisms relate to CD another and their environment ) , oceanography ( DT NN of NNP ’s oceans ) , glaciology ( DT NN of NNP ’s NN masses ) , and even DT social sciences ( DT NN of human behaviour in its social and cultural aspects ) . A full understanding of DT NNP system requires knowledge of how DT system and its components have changed through NN . DT pursuit of this understanding has led to development of NNP system history , an interdisciplinary NN WDT includes not only DT contributions of NNP system NNS but RB paleontologists ( who VBP DT life of past geologic periods ) , paleoclimatologists ( who VBP past climates ) , paleoecologists ( who VBP past environments and ecosystems ) , paleoceanographers ( who VBP DT history of DT oceans ) , and other NNS concerned with NNP history . Because different components of DT NNP system VBP at different rates and are relevant at different timescales , NNP system history is a diverse and complex NN . Students of NNP system history are not just concerned with documenting what has happened ; PRP RB view DT past as a series of experiments in which solar radiation , ocean currents , continental configurations , atmospheric chemistry , and other important features have varied . These experiments provide opportunities to learn DT relative influences of and interactions between various components of DT NNP system . Studies of NNP system history RB specify DT full array of NNS DT system has experienced in DT past and those DT system is capable of experiencing in DT future . Undoubtedly , NNS have always been aware of climatic variation at DT relatively short timescales of seasons , NNS , and decades . Biblical scripture and other early documents refer to droughts , floods , periods of severe cold , and other climatic events . Nevertheless , a full appreciation of DT nature and magnitude of climatic NN did not come about until DT late 18th and early 19th centuries , a NN when DT widespread recognition of DT deep antiquity of NNP occurred . Naturalists of this NN , including Scottish geologist Charles Lyell , Swiss - born naturalist and geologist Louis Agassiz , English naturalist Charles Darwin , American botanist Asa Gray , and Welsh naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace , came to recognize geologic and biogeographic evidence WDT made sense only in DT light of past climates radically different from those prevailing today . Geologists and paleontologists in DT 19th and early 20th centuries uncovered evidence of massive climatic changes taking place before DT Pleistocene — WDT is , before some 2.6 million NNS ago . For example , red beds indicated aridity in regions WDT are now humid ( e.g. , England and NNP England ) , whereas fossils of coal - swamp plants and reef corals indicated IN tropical climates once occurred at present - day high latitudes in both Europe and North America . Since DT late 20th century DT development of advanced technologies for dating rocks , together with geochemical techniques and other analytical tools , have revolutionized DT understanding of early NNP system history . DT occurrence of multiple epochs in recent NNP history during which continental glaciers , developed at high latitudes , penetrated into northern Europe and eastern North America was recognized by NNS by DT late 19th century . Scottish geologist James Croll proposed IN recurring variations in orbital eccentricity ( DT deviation of NNP ’s orbit from a perfectly circular path ) were responsible for alternating glacial and interglacial periods . Croll ’s controversial idea was taken up by Serbian mathematician and astronomer Milutin Milankovitch in DT early 20th century . Milankovitch proposed IN DT mechanism WDT brought about periods of glaciation was driven by cyclic changes in eccentricity as well as two other orbital parameters : precession ( a NN in DT directional focus of NNP ’s axis of rotation ) and axial tilt ( a NN in DT inclination of NNP ’s axis with respect to DT plane of its orbit around DT Sun ) . Orbital variation is now recognized as an important driver of climatic variation throughout NNP ’s history ( see below Orbital [ Milankovitch ] variations ) ."

In short , PRP have disguised their JJ depopulation scheme as being a necessary action in DT effort to fight NN NN . “ Here ’s a provocative thought : Maybe PRP should protect our kids by not having them , ” says Rieder . Provocative indeed , but DT scheme ( at least in its first stage ) is being candy - coated to make PRP sound more palatable to DT average citizen . DT depopulation birth tax MD apply more heavily to DT rich , while encouraging DT poor to use more birth control , according to Rieder and his colleagues , who say IN DT plan will not be as “ abusive ” as NNP ’s CD - child policy . “ PRP aims to persuade NNS to choose fewer NNS with a strategy WDT boils down to carrots for DT poor , sticks for DT rich . “ Ethically , Rieder says poor nations VBP some slack because PRP ’re still developing , and because their per capita NNS are a sliver of DT developed NN ’s . Plus , PRP just does n’t look good for rich , Western nations to tell NNS in poor ones not to have kids . ” Of course , DT rich can afford a “ childbirth tax , ” while DT rest of PRP non-elites will be DT ones forced to abandon having NNS to comply with DT depopulation scheme . Rieder claims IN by reducing worldwide childbirth rates by “ half a child per woman , ” carbon NNS MD be reduced by as much as CD - quarter of DT amount needed to avoid DT “ tipping point ” WDT will lead to 4 degrees Celsius JJ NN by DT end of DT century – a level of NN WDT will ostensibly make DT NN “ largely uninhabitable for humans . ” His plan has created plenty of controversy already ; Rieder receives “ nasty comments ” online , and has raised DT ire of NN NN skeptics such as Marc Morano of NNP Depot . “ DT warmists have now graduated from regulating our light bulbs , coal plants and SUVs to regulating our family size , ” VBD Morano . “ Let ’s keep ‘ JJ NN ’ out of DT bedroom ! ” As radical as Rieder ’s proposals MD sound , EX are those among DT NN NN activists who are calling for even more drastic measures . According to DT Sierra Club : “ Childbearing [ should be ] a punishable crime against society , unless DT parents hold a NN license . ” Even more extreme is DT stance of DT Voluntary Human Extinction Movement , whose members maintain IN “ voluntary human extinction is DT humanitarian alternative to human disasters , ” and IN humans should commit “ species suicide ” to save DT environment . DT hidden agenda is no longer hidden And so PRP appears IN DT gloves are now off , as DT JJ elites have begun to VB JJ with their depopulation plans . These self - appointed saviors apparently envision a NN in which PRP alone will enjoy DT benefits of a reduced population , while DT rabble are encouraged – or outright coerced – into non-reproduction . Who gave them DT power to make these decisions ? DT answer is IN PRP did – or at least JJ of PRP did – by allowing ourselves to be duped by fearmongers IN Al Gore and others bent on selling DT so IN DT elite MD take over DT NN and fashion PRP into something WDT serves their interests . PRP need to understand IN DT issue is not NN NN at all ; DT real agenda is creating a NN where PRP and I and our NNS ’s NNS will no longer be allowed to exist . Our very is now being threatened by DT JJ elite – if PRP let them carry out their plans ."

Students at Wisconsin learn under Dr. Jonathan Patz , who had already been consulting for DT NNP Nations on accelerating man-made NN NN ’s NN impacts decades ago . DT students examine , for instance , heat - related mortality , as well as DT healthy “ upside ” of adapting to DT effects of NN NN . Reducing PRP ’s reliance on cars and eating smarter benefits DT human body and Mother NNP alike , Patz argues . Wisconsin is just CD of roughly two dozen JJ schools leading — although only typically by offering a few courses — in DT training of physicians , nurses , pharmacists and other practitioners who will take to DT front lines of diagnosing and treating DT impact of NN NN . DT impact is showing up increasingly in emergencies , such as wildfires , and in complicated - pregnancy statistics even in developed nations . More broadly , DT spread of toxins , asthma NNS , cardiovascular NN and Lyme NN is on DT rise , all part of what DT Lancet has deemed DT biggest JJ NN threat of DT 21st century . Yet DT slow drip of JJ or amended JJ - school programs WDT address NN NN must be accelerated , some experts stress . Their efforts got an important boost after DT American NNP Association in 2019 gave its backing to expanding NN - NN training . “ NN NN is our reality . PRP is VBG to VB DT way PRP provide clinical care . For DT reason , PRP needs to be taught in every JJ school across DT nation , ” VBD Dr. Ashish Jha , DT K.T. Li Professor of NNP NNP and NNP Policy at Harvard ’s T.H. Chan School of NNP NNP , writing in DT Journal of DT American NNP Association . So far , NN - related scholarship has emerged in DT last few NNS via elective courses and CD - off lectures rather than treated as a portion of core curriculum , according to a NN published in 2018 in DT journal Academic Medicine . Those researchers found IN a database was created but is lacking comprehensive reporting by schools of what NN - NN lessons are taught . DT lingering challenge : JJ schools believe PRP can’t devote significant attention to NN NN in an already packed curriculum . DT NN burden MD be eased via shared materials . Columbia University ’s Mailman School of NNP NNP formed DT NNP Consortium on NNP and NNP Education in 2017 to begin to share ideas on how to train NN professionals . To date , PRP can count some 180 signatories of mostly JJ - NN programs , but RB over 20 JJ schools and another two dozen nursing programs . Even without dedicated coursework , existing classes should include more NN - NN teaching , say proponents . For instance , an asthma - diagnosing exercise with questions more closely tied to pollution exposure has now been in practice at DT University of Illinois College of Medicine at Urbana - Champaign and is driving curriculum priorities at DT University of California , San Francisco , near where deadly fires raged over DT last couple of NNS . Air pollution is responsible for about seven million deaths a NN worldwide , according to DT NNP NNP Organization , which found IN reducing DT burning of fossil fuels MD avoid 2.5 million premature deaths each NN by 2050 . Pollen and other aeroallergen levels are RB higher in extreme heat . These factors can trigger asthma , which affects around 300 million NNS but can usually be treated . Physicians RB need better training in screening for vector - borne illnesses ( infectious pathogens spread from CD living organism to another ; VB ticks or mosquitoes ) which are expected to increase with higher temperatures . Diagnosed NNS of tick - spread Lyme NN , for instance , doubled between 2004 and 2016 , according to DT Centers for NNP Control and Prevention . Mosquitoes are cold - blooded vectors of NN , so any mosquito - borne NN will be affected by very small changes in temperature . Environmental changes RB affect respiratory NN , cardiovascular NN and cerebrovascular mortality or stroke , VBD Harvard ’s Jha . Globally , DT JJ profession RB has a stake in policy around access to clean drinking NN and fighting nutrient depletion in crops and food from NN effects . DT benefits of DT work under way at UC , San Francisco , part of a broader statewide system , is IN JJ practices might be implemented throughout its several hospitals , clinics and classrooms , and much of DT JJ training is geared toward layering on to existing course work . For instance , PRP ’s important for JJ students to understand DT effects WDT hotter temperatures can have on DT effectiveness and risks of pharmaceuticals , such as antipsychotics and diuretics , VBD UCSF ’s Dr. Sheri Weiser , an epidemiologist and practicing internist at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital , who RB holds a master ’s degree in JJ NN . Arianne Teherani , Ph.D. , a professor of medicine and education at UCSF , says JJ training in NN awareness is n’t just about diagnostics but fully understanding DT role of medicine in creating and fixing DT effects of NN NN . If DT U.S. NN - care system were a country , PRP MD rank 13th in DT NN for greenhouse gas NNS , DT article in Academic Medicine cites . Professors of anesthesia , radiology and pharmacy , for example , are encouraged to teach IN anesthetic gases , imaging technologies and pharmaceuticals all have a significant carbon footprint WDT MD need to be offset , at DT least , with green best - practices elsewhere , such as a shift to more NN efficiency in hospitals and offices . More work is needed , Teherani says , in cutting DT industry ’s footprint overall . EX ’s RB mental NN to consider . Sobering NN - NN statistics , no matter their projected NN for realization , are already having an impact . Dr. Karla Ivankovich , Ph.D. , a licensed clinical professional counselor and professor of psychology at DT University of Illinois at Springfield , VBD DT mental - NN profession has seen growing political anxiety from a widening trench of partisanship carry over into NN - VB dread , and JJ therapists MD welcome additional training . Ivankovich VBD IN she and other therapists are seeing patients who , among other concerns , find themselves troubled by DT choice to have NNS more than past clients had , which Ivankovich linked in part to their fears for NN NN and their response to DT pickup in NN coverage . Not all who wear DT white coat VBP IN addressing NN NN in DT exam room is true to DT profession ’s intent . “ DT zeitgeist of sociology and social work have become DT driving force in JJ education . DT goal of today ’s educators is to produce legions of primary care physicians who engage in what is termed ‘ population NN . ’ This fits perfectly with DT current administrator - rich , policy - heavy , form - over - function approach at every level of American education , ” wrote Dr. Stanley Goldfarb , a former associate dean of curriculum at DT University of Pennsylvania ’s Perelman School of Medicine , in an opinion piece for DT Wall Street Journal . “ Meanwhile , oncologists , cardiologists , surgeons and other JJ specialists are in short supply . ” Jha , writing in JAMA , MD argue IN view neglects both DT NN warning signs and DT way medicine should evolve . “ With DT ubiquitous presence of information technology , including clinical decision support tools , students and physicians now have ready access to all DT JJ knowledge ever created … [ JJ JJ schools ] still spend too much NN teaching topics such as laboratory methods and having students memorize anatomic details WDT can be covered more quickly or not at all , ” he says NN professionals operating as a gatekeeper for NN - NN risks is effective , argues Dr. Courtney Howard , an emergency physician in Canada ’s subarctic Yellowknife , Northwest Territories , where DT changing conditions risk major life changes for her native patients in particular . Howard routinely argues , including in this TEDx talk , IN DT trust JJ professionals tend to cultivate with patients positions them to best teach about NN - NN impacts ; she cites survey statistics showing nurses routinely rank at DT top of a list of professionals WDT NNS trust , with doctors in second place and politicians in dead last . “ PRP all have pull and PRP need to use PRP ” to combat NN NN , Howard regularly tells NN professionals . If Wisconsin ’s Patz has his way , DT future of NN curriculum will break slightly with med - school norms , equipping doctors and nurses to better engage with experts outside of DT NN - care setting . DT includes urban planners , civil and environmental engineers , and of course , JJ - NN officials . Treatment and advocacy should never be separate pursuits , he argues ."

Now , designers in Indonesia have offered up what MD be DT most audacious plan yet : PRP propose building NN - making submarines WDT MD ply polar waters and pop out icebergs to replace melting floes . “ NN level rise due to melting NN should not only be responded [ to ] with defensive solutions , ” DT designers of DT submersible iceberg factory VBD in an animated video describing DT vessel , which took second place in a recent design competition held by DT Association of Siamese Architects . DT video shows DT proposed submarine dipping slowly beneath DT ocean surface to allow seawater to fill its large hexagonal well . When DT vessel surfaces , an onboard desalination system removes DT salt from DT NN and a “ giant freezing machine ” and chilly ambient temperatures freeze DT fresh NN to create DT six - sided bergs . These float away when DT vessel resubmerges and starts DT process all over again . A fleet of DT NN - making subs , operating continuously , MD create enough of DT 25 - meter - wide “ NN babies ” to make a larger NN sheet , according to DT designers . Faris Rajak Kotahatuhaha , an architect in Jakarta and DT leader of DT project , VBD he sees DT design as a complement to ongoing efforts to curb NNS . “ To stop JJ NN , of course PRP still have to reduce carbon NNS throughout DT NN , ” he VBD in a message , adding IN he advocated a two - pronged approach to curbing NN NN : reduce carbon NNS on CD hand and rebuild lost NN on DT other . Experts praised DT designers ' vision but cast doubt on DT project 's feasibility . “ PRP ’s IN trying to save DT sand castle PRP built at DT beach using a dixie cup as DT tide comes in , ” Michael Mann , a professor of atmospheric sciences at Penn NNP , VBD of DT iceberg - making proposal . Mark Serreze , director of DT University of Colorado ’s National Snow and NNP Data Center in Boulder , offered a similar assessment . He called DT project “ very interesting ” but VBD PRP raised more questions than PRP answered . “ What are PRP VBG to do , put out a flotilla of 10,000 submarines ? ” he VBD . “ Who ’s VBG to build them and how much NN does PRP take , and how are DT submarines powered ? ” And unless PRP ’re powered by wind or another clean NN source , he added , DT submarines MD need to burn fossil fuels , releasing even more NN - VBG greenhouse gases into DT air . If DT icebergs were big enough , PRP might help curb NN level rise indirectly by reflecting more of DT solar radiation WDT raises JJ temperatures . But Serreze VBD creating DT bergs MD n’t lower NN levels directly if PRP remained in DT NN ; they'd have to wind up on land to reduce DT volume of DT oceans . More important , Serreze VBD , rebuilding NN NN MD do nothing to address DT greenhouse gas NNS WDT are DT root cause of NN NN . “ PRP ’s simply a Band - Aid , ” he VBD of DT NN - making vessel idea . Serreze voiced similar concerns about other recent proposals for geoengineering DT environment to mitigate DT effects of NN NN , including everything from spraying sunlight - blocking aerosols into DT atmosphere to deploying millions of wind - powered pumps to spread seawater over DT NN 's northernmost reaches . Such plans are often not feasible , he VBD , and PRP MD have unintended consequences WDT compound our environmental problems . For example , he VBD , DT spraying of aerosols in CD region MD lead to droughts in another . Nevertheless , he called geoengineering an important tool in DT ongoing fight against NN NN — but CD WDT should be considered a last resort . “ EX has been a lot of work on geoengineering , and PRP should continue , ” he VBD . “ PRP never VBP to VB in DT direction .

IN other oxygen - dependent creatures , humans emit carbon dioxide WDT 's produced by metabolic processes necessary to live , DT NNS explained . DT amount of carbon dioxide -- a greenhouse gas -- produced by a species is determined by its average metabolic rate , average body size and DT total number of individuals of DT species . Obese NNS produce more carbon dioxide than those of normal weight , DT researchers VBD . RB , obese NNS consume greater quantities of food and beverages WDT need to be produced and transported to them , and transportation of obese NNS requires more consumption of fossil fuels . This means higher carbon dioxide NNS related to food production and transportation for obese NNS , DT NN authors explained . DT researchers estimated IN obesity contributes to an extra 700 megatons of carbon dioxide NNS per NN worldwide , or about 1.6 % of all human - caused NNS . Overall , being obese is associated with about 20 % more greenhouse gas NNS ( carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide ) than being a normal weight , according to DT NN published online Dec. 20 in DT journal Obesity . "" This has important implications for all those involved in DT management of obesity , "" Magkos added in a journal NN release .

E&E_NNP provides_VBZ daily_JJ coverage_NN of_IN essential_JJ energy_NN and_CC environmental_JJ news_NN at_IN www.eenews.net._ADD","DT White House laid out its policy priorities for a second NNP term yesterday , and NN NN was n’t on DT agenda . In fact , DT word “ NN ” did n’t appear at all in DT 138 - page main budget document , which asked Congress for a total of $ 4.8 trillion to fund DT NN ’s priorities across DT federal NN in fiscal 2021 . DT figure MD mean a slight increase in federal spending overall compared with DT status quo and MD enable DT NNP administration to grow DT military to include DT U.S. Space Force and to fund favorite infrastructure projects IN DT border wall . But DT agencies WDT are most responsible for addressing NN NN at home and abroad — including EPA and DT departments of NNP and NNP — MD see steep cuts under DT proposal . And programs within those agencies WDT deal directly with NN NN MD take DT biggest hit . Congress , however , is almost certain to reject DT budget blueprint as is . For CD thing , PRP violates a bipartisan agreement on spending WDT Congress reached last summer . In addition — even before Democrats gained control of DT House — Congress routinely MD override NNP ’s efforts to slash funding for NN - related items such as EPA grants to NNS and DOE ’s Advanced Research Projects Agency - NNP , a research and development program . And this NN Congress is likely to finish funding DT federal NN after November ’s presidential election . DT result likely will weigh heavily on DT appropriations process . But DT budget document does provide a sneak peek of what NNP MD VB to do with a second term , including an extension to DT 2017 tax cuts and continued efforts toward deregulation . And PRP includes his reelection pitch to voters — insomuch WDT PRP argues IN his pro-business policies have resulted in a “ blue - collar ” JJ boom WDT has benefited workers , especially those in DT NN sector . In DT budget proposal , as in last week ’s NN of DT Union address , NNP celebrated DT NNP NNPS ’ arrival as a major oil and gas producer WDT ’s set in 2020 to be a net petroleum exporter . DT shift began under NNP Obama , but NNP claimed credit for himself and his deregulatory policies . “ More jobs , lower costs , and American dominance — these are predictable results of our pro-energy policies , ” NNP wrote in his budget request . EPA , which is celebrating half a century of existence this NN , MD receive $ 6.7 billion for fiscal 2021 — a 27 % cut compared with enacted levels . PRP RB MD slash its workforce by about 11 % , to DT lowest levels since 1985 . DT administration stressed in DT budget and its supporting documents IN this NN MD return EPA to its “ core mission ” of protecting “ clean air , land and NN , and ensuring chemical safety , while targeting emerging domestic and JJ environmental challenges . ” PRP ’s unclear whether DT last part of DT line is a veiled reference to NN NN , but DT issue is n’t mentioned by name in DT EPA section of DT main budget document . In an informal summary provided by EPA , PRP appears six times — mainly in DT titles of programs slated for elimination . EPA tangled with California last NN over DT NN ’s struggle to comply with DT National Ambient Air Quality Standards . DT budget asks Congress for a total of $ 437 million for EPA ’s air quality work overall , down from DT current funding level of $ 813 million . DT includes reduced budgets for enforcement , NN and technology , and other programs . DT air and NN research program , which supports future regulations , MD lose two - thirds of its budget — a sign IN EPA under NNP is n’t contemplating JJ JJ regulatory actions . DT budget request RB MD cut funding to implement DT Montreal Protocol , a globally popular ozone treaty WDT ’s now RB phasing down hydrofluorocarbons — a powerful class of greenhouse gases used in cooling and refrigeration . While EX ’s scant mention of NN NN in EPA ’s budget , DT issue does appear in a section on “ wasteful "" spending items at EPA WDT DT NNP administration has recommended for DT chopping block . DT budget again proposes moving DT NNP Star NN efficiency program — which is jointly administered by EPA and DOE — to a user - fee model WDT Congress previously has rejected . DT same section RB floated plans to zero out funding for several EPA NN NN partnership programs including DT Coalbed Methane Outreach Program , DT NNP Methane Initiative and Natural Gas STAR . “ These programs are not essential to EPA ’s core mission and can be implemented by DT private sector , ” PRP VBZ . Sean Alcorn , a legislative analyst with DT Natural Resources Defense Council , VBD DT proposal to cut full - NN EPA staff from 14,172 positions to 12,610 MD VB rid of expertise at DT agency — a move WDT MD pay dividends for NNP ’s anti-regulatory agenda even if he does n’t win in November . “ This is trying to eviscerate DT knowledge store WDT PRP have for future administrations , ” he VBD . “ PRP ’s setting EPA up to fail in future NNS . ” DT fiscal 2021 budget justification for DT NNP Department includes CD fleeting reference to NN NN as an issue , IN armed conflict and poverty , WDT is best solved through multilateral channels . But DT NNP administration again proposes steep cuts to DT top diplomatic agency of more than 21 % to $ 40.8 billion , down from $ 53 billion enacted for fiscal 2020 . DT scope of DT cuts is difficult to gauge because DT proposal eliminates some budget lines and combines others . But observers say DT result MD be deep reductions in U.S. support for multilateral and bilateral partnerships on DT environment , renewable NN , adaptation , sustainable landscapes , forestry and other issues . Capitol Hill generally has rejected those moves and seems likely to do so again . In DT last two NNS , Congress has rejected NNP administration efforts to halve support for DT JJ Environment Facility , which funds projects in developing NNS . DT NNP NNPS remains a top contributor to DT fund despite efforts by DT NNP administration to zero out funding for fiscal 2020 . “ I VBP DT message to DT vulnerable NNS WDT VBP support from DT GEF and from other funds is to pay attention to what gets into DT final appropriations bill and not what is VBN in these requests , because PRP are messaging documents , ” VBD Joe Thwaites , who follows NN finance for DT NNP Resources Institute . But funding for DT NNP Nations ’ high - profile Green NNP Fund is unlikely to be restored while NNP is in office . DT fund has been a target for GOP lawmakers who have resisted NNP ’s suggested cuts to other diplomatic budget lines . NNP ’s budget request proposes major cuts to disaster - response agencies such as DT Federal Emergency Management Agency and DT Army Corps of Engineers . But Congress previously has overridden similar proposals . A cut of $ 1.7 billion in Army Corps funding , to $ 6 billion next NN , MD reduce DT agency ’s spending on flood control — but DT is unlikely to be sustained . DT administration wants to eliminate funding “ for projects WDT are better suited to be carried out by NNS and local communities . ” But Congress has given DT Army Corps more money than administrations have requested since at least 2006 and has funneled increasing amounts in DT past three NNS as intense flooding has damaged levees , according to DT Congressional Research Service . DT administration is renewing its effort to eliminate a $ 10 million FEMA program , enacted in DT final month of DT Obama administration , WDT helps communities pay for repairs to “ high - hazard ” dams whose failure MD result in loss of life . Such projects are “ better suited to be carried out by NNS and local communities , ” DT administration says in its budget proposal . Congress repeatedly has restored DT funding . DT administration RB is trying again to cut FEMA ’s flood - mapping budget to $ 100 million from $ 263 million , saying IN mapping DT nation ’s floodplains “ is not solely a federal responsibility . ” Congress has blocked each attempted budget cut . DT administration MD find agreement with Congress in overhauling a much - maligned disaster recovery program administered by DT Department of Housing and Urban Development . Congress has given HUD $ 40 billion in emergency funding since 2017 to help communities rebuild from major disasters such as Hurricanes Harvey , Irma and Maria in 2017 . But funding has been mired in huge delays because federal law requires HUD to undertake a long and detailed rulemaking process before PRP can release DT money . Congressional leaders from both parties — as well as advocates — are looking to revamp HUD ’s disaster - recovery program so money can be allocated more quickly . DT administration says in its budget proposal IN PRP “ seeks to work with DT Congress to comprehensively reform and redesign ” DT HUD program , which PRP calls “ slow , unpredictable , and wasteful . ” DT administration wants to eliminate funding for a NASA program WDT is developing an observatory to monitor NNP to better understand NN NN . NASA ’s NNP Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory MD produce “ highly accurate and trusted NN records ” WDT can help produce policies on mitigation and adaptation “ WDT address DT effects of NN NN on society , ” NASA says . DT observatory is scheduled to launch in 2023 . DT administration acknowledges DT observatory “ MD provide additional capabilities over existing satellites ” but says DT project “ is a lower priority compared to other NASA programs . ” DT administration ’s budget boosts funding for missions to land astronauts on DT moon and Mars . DT NNP Department MD see a cut of 8 % compared with 2020 enacted levels , to $ 38.5 billion . DOE ’s Advanced Research Projects Agency - NNP is again proposed for elimination , but Congress previously has shown no willingness to kill DT popular research and development program . DT Interior Department MD see its budget reduced 13 % for fiscal 2021 , to $ 12.8 billion . House Democrats have accused DT NNP administration of withholding funds from DT U.S. Geological Survey ’s NNP Adaptation NNP Centers at Interior , which operate as partnerships with universities . Rep. Betty McCollum ( D - Minn. ) , chairwoman of DT Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee , pressed DT matter during testimony from USGS Director James Reilly . Reilly claimed ignorance during DT April hearing . Afterward , documents obtained through DT Freedom of Information Act showed NNP administration staffers were working to heed McCollum ’s warning . “ Congress will pay attention to DT implementation of this funding , ” according to a June meeting agenda for high - level staffers of USGS , Interior ’s assistant secretary for NN and NN , and DT Bureau of Reclamation .

In DT run-up to DT meeting , EU leaders have cranked up DT rhetoric about DT need for tough action to tackle JJ NN , although some environmentalists say IN proposed targets do not VB far enough . German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who will host European leaders for DT first NN under Germany 's EU presidency , stressed DT urgency of their task by warning IN Europe was at an "" important crossroads . "" "" If PRP act decisively now , PRP have a chance of effectively counteracting DT dangers of NN NN , "" she VBD in her invitation to DT summit . Merkel told DT British Financial Times newspaper on Wednesday IN she wanted "" Europe to take a ' pioneering lead ' on meaningful green initiatives . "" Merkel was seconded by former NNP Vice NNP , Al Gore who recently picked up an Oscar for his documentary on DT ravages of JJ NN .

"" I VBP EX is DT real possibility of showing how Europe can lead DT debate on NN NN , on NN security , and on deregulation in DT interest of a more competitive European economy , "" Blair VBD on Tuesday in London . EU leaders are expected to endorse plans to cut carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) NNS by 20 percent by 2020 , from 1990 levels , and by 30 percent if other developed and emerging economies , particularly NNP and India , join them . DT European Union produces about 14 percent of DT NN 's greenhouse gas NNS while DT NNP NNPS , DT NN 's largest polluter , produces some 25 percent . Although DT summit is expected to provide a show of unity , tensions are brewing under DT surface over DT role of nuclear NN and DT use of renewable NN sources . CD of DT liveliest debates is expected on whether to set a binding target of renewable NN sources meeting 20 percent of Europe 's NN needs by 2020 , after foreign ministers failed to reach an agreement on Monday . Environmentalists : "" PRP 's not enough "" Although Europe is leading efforts to combat NN NN , some environmentalists warned IN DT EU leaders are not aiming high enough . "" DT EU 's NN action plan ... will fall a long way short in making Europe 's NN more sustainable unless targets for both renewable share and reducing greenhouse gases are raised and tightened , "" VBD Friends of DT NNP NN campaigner Jan Kowalzig . NN policy has climbed to DT top of DT EU political agenda over DT last NN as oil price spikes and cuts in gas and oil supplies from Russia have spurred DT bloc to forge a common strategy to meeting their needs . However , despite DT growing importance attached to NN , DT EU has struggled to hammer out a common approach , with member NNS often putting national interests first , much to DT frustration of DT European Commission . Such is DT case with a European Commission idea to inject greater competition into DT EU NN market with plans to make large , integrated gas and power companies split their generating and distribution networks . Leaders are likely to send DT plan back to DT drawing board with France and to a lesser extent Germany opposed to DT idea , which MD cause a major shake - up of French and German NN groups . DT summit comes amid a shifting European political landscape with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi emerging shaken from a recent crisis , British Prime Minister Tony Blair increasingly a lame duck , and looming French presidential elections in April and NNP . PRP will RB be French NNP Jacques Chirac 's last chance to leave his mark on EU policy - making after nearly 12 NNS in office fiercely defending French interests during meetings with EU leaders . Looking ahead as Germany chairs DT Group of Eight industrial nations this NN , Merkel will likely VB to take DT conclusions of this week 's meetings into DT G8 summit in Heiligendamm , Germany in June ."

"" This reality is being ignored by governments around DT NN , "" VBD James Hansen , who famously announced to DT NNP Congress 30 NNS ago IN JJ NN was underway . "" To say IN PRP are ' moving in DT right direction ' just is n't good enough anymore , "" he VBD in an interview . Head of NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies until 2013 , Hansen and his 18 - NN - old granddaughter -- who is suing DT NNP NN for contributing to DT problem -- delivered DT message this week at UN NN negotiations in Bonn . Thousands of diplomats at DT 12 - day , 196 - nation talks are haggling over DT fine print of a "" user 's manual "" for a treaty WDT will VB into effect in 2020 . Inked in DT French capital in 2015 , DT Paris Agreement calls for capping JJ NN at two degrees Celsius ( 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) . With DT NN out of kilter after only CD degree of NN -- enough to amplify deadly heatwaves , superstorms and droughts -- DT treaty RB vows to explore DT feasibility of holding DT line at 1.5 C . "" DT is a good impulse , because if PRP VBP to 2 C , PRP is guaranteed IN PRP will lose our shorelines and coastal cities , "" VBD Hansen . "" DT only question is how fast . "" NNP 's surface temperature , DT amount of CO2 in DT atmosphere , and NN levels have all changed in lock - step over hundreds of millions of NNS , he pointed out . In 2016 , atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide -- DT main greenhouse gas -- tipped over 403 parts per million ( ppm ) , 40 percent above DT pre-industrial average and DT highest level in at least 800,000 NNS , DT UN's weather agency reported this week . Even under optimistic scenarios , DT number is projected to rise for decades . DT UN's NN advisory body , DT Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) , has VBN PRP can "" likely "" stay under DT 2 C threshold if CO2 levels do n't exceed 450 ppm by 2100 . For Hansen , DT 's a recipe for disaster . Meltwater from DT Greenland and Antarctic NN sheets MD add metres to NN levels by 2100 , he has calculated . "" DT last NN in NNP 's history IN CO2 concentrations were at 450 ppm , NN level was 25 metres ( 80 feet ) higher , "" he noted . When writer and environmentalist Bill McKibben decided a decade ago to launch a campaign to fight JJ NN , he asked DT NN 's best known NN scientist what he should call PRP . "" He had in mind DT name ' 450.org ' , "" Hansen recalled . By coincidence , Hansen was about to publish a major NN WDT concluded DT ceiling for CO2 levels should be 350 ppm , at most . Thus was born 350.org , probably DT largest grassroots NN action organisation in DT NN . "" Hansen does make a compelling case IN JJ NN NN impacts are occurring sooner and with greater magnitude than PRP expected , "" VBD Michael Mann , director of DT NNP System NNP Center at Pennsylvania NNP University . "" Jim 's past predictions have proven prescient and PRP do indeed ignore him at our peril . "" "" Hansen 's contributions to DT basic NN of NN NN are fundamental to our current understanding -- no NN has contributed more , "" VBD Michael Oppenheimer , a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University . Even if humanity succeeds in bending down DT curve of greenhouse NNS far sooner than currently seems imaginable , PRP MD not be fast enough to bring CO2 levels back to 350 ppm by century 's end , according to Hansen . "" PRP MD have to extract 150 billion tonnes of carbon from DT atmosphere , "" more than 10 times DT amount PRP emit each NN , he VBD . DT technology to do DT does not currently exist . At 76 , Hansen is thinking a lot about and what kind of NN young NNS will be inheriting . So is his granddaughter , Sophie Kivlehan , a first NN university student in DT NNP NNPS . Along with 20 of her peers , Kivlehan has sued DT NNP federal NN for what might best be called NN negligence . "" When DT NNP Constitution says ' PRP DT NNPS , ' DT means young NNS too , "" she VBD in an interview . "" PRP have constitutional rights , and those rights are being violated . "" DT case is currently wending its way through DT federal court system , and MD CD day wind up before DT Supreme Court , CD of DT lawyers representing DT plaintiffs told AFP . NN attempts to have DT case thrown out have failed . Despite his grim predictions , Hansen has not thrown his hands up in despair . He continues , for example , to campaign for a direct tax on fossil fuels as DT only realistic way to achieve DT necessary cuts ."

Until recently , natural factors have been DT cause of these changes . Natural influences on DT NN include volcanic eruptions , changes in DT orbit of DT NNP , and shifts in DT NNP 's crust ( known as plate tectonics ) . Over DT past CD million NNS , DT NNP has experienced a series of NN - ages ( ' glacial periods ' ) and warmer periods ( ' interglacial ' ) . Glacial and interglacial periods cycle roughly every 100,000 NNS , caused by changes in NNP 's orbit around DT sun . For DT past few thousand NNS , NNP has been in an interglacial period with a constant temperature . However , since DT Industrial Revolution in DT 1800s , DT JJ temperature has increased at a much faster rate . By burning fossil fuels and changing how PRP use DT land , human activity has quickly become DT leading cause of changes to our NN . How does DT NN system work ? Some gases in DT NNP 's atmosphere trap heat and stop PRP escaping into space . PRP call these ' greenhouse gases ' . These gases act as a VBG blanket around DT NNP , known as DT ' greenhouse effect ' . Greenhouse gases come from both human and natural sources . Gases IN carbon dioxide , methane , and nitrous oxide naturally occur in DT atmosphere . Others , such as chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) , are only produced by human activity . When short - wave radiation from DT sun reaches NNP , most of PRP passes straight through and hits DT surface . DT NNP absorbs most of this radiation and gives off longer - wavelength infrared radiation . DT greenhouse gases absorb some of this infrared radiation , instead of PRP passing straight out into space . DT atmosphere then emits radiation in all directions , sending some of PRP back to DT surface , causing DT NN to heat up . This process is known as DT ' greenhouse effect ' . DT greenhouse effect is critical to our survival . In fact , without greenhouse gases , NNP MD be about 30 degrees colder than PRP is today . Without greenhouse gases and their NN effect , PRP MD n't be able to survive . However , since DT Industrial Revolution , PRP 've been adding more and more greenhouse gases into DT air , trapping even more heat . Instead of keeping NNP at a warm , stable temperature , DT greenhouse effect is heating DT NN at a much faster rate . PRP call this DT ' enhanced greenhouse effect ' and it's DT main cause of NN NN . Humans cause NN NN by releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into DT air . Today , EX is more carbon dioxide in DT atmosphere than EX ever has been in at least DT past 800,000 NNS . During DT 20th and 21st century , DT level of carbon dioxide rose by 40 % . PRP produce greenhouse gases in lots of different ways : • Burning fossil fuels – Fossil fuels such as oil , gas , and coal contain carbon dioxide WDT has been ' locked away ' in DT ground for thousands of NNS . When PRP take these out of DT land and burn them , PRP release DT stored carbon dioxide into DT air . • Deforestation – Forests remove and store carbon dioxide from DT atmosphere . Cutting them down means IN carbon dioxide builds up quicker since EX are no trees to absorb PRP . Not only DT , trees release DT carbon PRP stored when PRP burn them . • Agriculture – Planting crops and rearing animals releases JJ different types of greenhouse gases into DT air . For example , animals produce methane , which is 30 times more powerful than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas . DT nitrous oxide used for fertilisers is ten times worse and is nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide ! • Cement – Producing cement is another contributor to NN NN , causing 2 % of our entire carbon dioxide NNS . Natural changes to DT NN DT leading cause of NN NN is human activity and DT release of greenhouse gases . However , EX are lots of natural causes WDT RB lead to changes in DT NN system . Natural cycles can cause DT NN to alternate between NN and cooling . EX are RB natural factors WDT force DT NN to VB , known as ' forcings ' . Even though these natural causes contribute to NN NN , PRP VBP IN PRP are not DT primary cause , based on scientific evidence . Some of these natural cycles include : • Milankovitch cycles – As NNP travels around DT sun , its path and DT tilt of its axis can VB slightly . These changes , called Milankovitch cycles , affect DT amount of sunlight WDT falls on NNP . This can cause DT temperature of NNP to VB . However , these cycles take place over tens or hundreds of thousands of NNS and are unlikely to be causing DT changes to DT NN WDT PRP are seeing today . • El Niño Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) – ENSO is a pattern of changing NN temperatures in DT Pacific Ocean . In an ' El Niño ' NN , DT JJ temperature warms up , and in a ' La Niña ' NN , PRP cools down . These patterns can affect DT JJ temperature for a short amount of NN ( months or NNS ) but cannot explain DT persistent NN WDT PRP see today . What is El Niño , what does PRP mean and how does PRP affect weather around DT NN ? Natural forcings WDT can contribute to NN NN include : • Solar irradiance – Changing NN from DT sun has affected DT temperature of NNP in DT past . However , PRP have not seen anything strong enough to VB our NN . Any increase in solar NN MD make DT entire atmosphere of NNP warm , but PRP can only see NN in DT bottom layer . • Volcanic eruptions – Volcanoes have a mixed effect on our NN . Eruptions produce aerosol particles WDT cool NNP , but PRP RB release carbon dioxide , which warms PRP . Volcanoes produce 50 times less carbon dioxide than humans do , so PRP VBP PRP are not DT leading cause of JJ NN . On top of this , cooling is DT dominant effect of volcanic eruptions , not NN . When looking at all DT evidence , EX is a large scientific consensus IN humans are DT leading cause of NN NN . In their latest report , DT Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP stated with over 95 % certainty IN human activity is DT main cause of JJ NN . Natural NN cycles can VB DT temperature of NNP , but DT changes PRP are seeing are happening at a scale and speed IN natural cycles cannot explain . These cycles affect DT JJ temperature for NNS , or sometimes just months , not DT 100 NNS WDT PRP have observed . Meanwhile , longer - term changes IN Milankovitch cycles and solar irradiance take thousands and thousands of NNS . EX are lots of things WDT affect NN NN , but DT evidence is irrefutable . Human activity , such as burning fossil fuels and changing how PRP use DT land , is DT leading cause of NN NN ."

DT Madurodam features little canals , old - fashioned windmills , tiny tulips and , amid PRP all , an homage to Royal Dutch Shell , DT oil giant WDT is DT biggest company in DT country and , by revenue , DT second largest publicly traded oil - and - gas company in DT NN . EX ’s a Shell drilling platform , a Shell gas station and a Shell natural - gas field , complete with a drilling rig . DT display is at once odd–energy infrastructure in a NNS ’s theme park–and entirely fitting : Shell has been , for decades , CD of DT most powerful players both in Dutch politics and on DT JJ JJ stage . But DT MD soon VB . As concerns grow over DT existential challenges posed by NN NN , Shell must grapple with its own existential crisis : How should a company WDT generates most of its profits by serving DT NN ’s enormous appetite for oil navigate a long - term future in which shifting political and JJ tides threaten to make fossil fuels obsolete ? DT pressure to abandon oil and gas is already in force . In recent NNS , protesters have swarmed Shell ’s headquarters ; advocates representing 17,000 Dutch citizens have sued DT company ; and powerful investors successfully coerced executives to say PRP will reduce NNS . In 2015 , NNS around DT NN promised to aggressively tackle greenhouse - gas NNS , in order to meet DT target laid out by DT Paris Agreement : goals WDT require buying and burning significantly less oil and gas . Shell CEO Ben van Beurden has a bird ’s - eye view of DT situation from his corner office at DT company ’s JJ headquarters in DT Hague . “ PRP have to figure out what are DT right bets to take in a NN WDT is completely changing because of society ’s concerns around NN NN , ” he says . Projections from NN companies show demand for oil MD peak and fall in DT coming decades ; some outside analyses suggest demand for oil MD plateau as soon as 2025 . Markets are already jittery about DT industry : NN was DT worst - performing sector on DT S&P 500 index in 2019 . In 1980 , DT NN industry represented 28 % of DT index ’s value , according to DT Institute for NNP Economics and Financial Analysis ( IEEFA ) . Last NN , PRP represented less than 5 % . DT shift away from oil looms so large IN Moody ’s warned in 2018 IN DT NN transition represents “ significant business and credit risk ” for oil companies . DT heads of DT Banks of England and France VBD in an op - ed IN any company WDT does not VB strategically to DT JJ NN reality “ will fail to exist . ” On Jan. 14 , Larry Fink , founder and CEO of investment giant BlackRock , wrote in an open letter IN “ NN NN has become a defining factor in companies ’ long - term prospects . ” As oil flirts with DT prospect of decline , NN executives are at odds over what to do . Some firms , IN ExxonMobil , are positioning themselves to squeeze DT last lucrative NNS from DT oil economy while arguing to shareholders IN PRP will be able to sell all their oil . Shell and a handful of others are beginning to adapt . Under van Beurden ’s leadership , Shell is charting a path WDT will allow PRP to continue to profit from oil and gas while simultaneously expanding its plastics business and diversifying into electrical power . By DT 2030s , DT 112 - NN - old fossil - fuel giant wants to become DT NN ’s largest power company . As part of this strategy , Shell has worked to present itself as environmentally friendly . Last NN , PRP committed to reduce its NNS by as much as 3 % by 2021 , and by around 50 % by 2050 , tying its executives ’ compensation to DT cuts . Shell ’s moves earned some applause among environmentalists , but DT Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP , DT U.N. ’s NN - NN body , concluded in 2018 IN to keep temperatures from rising to levels WDT MD bring a wide range of catastrophes , NNS must halve their greenhouse - gas NNS by 2030 and hit net - zero NNS by 2050 . DT MD mean more than incrementally reducing NNS ; PRP means keeping vast reserves of oil already discovered in DT ground . Van Beurden ’s strategic response shows IN NNS of political and JJ pressure–especially from governments and investors responding to a sustained JJ outcry–can push even DT most powerful interests to VB . Whether NN activists can harness this mounting pressure to compel Shell and other oil companies to transform DT JJ NN economy MD be DT weightiest question of our NN . Executives at Shell knew decades ago IN burning fossil fuels MD cause DT NN to warm , and IN once NN NN became a JJ issue , their firm MD need to VB . Last NN , I sat down with van Beurden for a wide - ranging interview and asked him how he felt about “ Shell knew , ” DT activist mantra WDT accuses DT company of failing to act on NN NN despite knowing DT consequences . He was sanguine : “ Yeah , PRP knew . Everybody knew , ” he VBD . “ And somehow PRP all ignored PRP . ” In DT 1990s , he explained , Shell publicly acknowledged NN NN and VBD DT NN needed to act to combat DT problem . But at DT NN , neither governments nor consumers seemed too concerned about NNS , and DT demand for oil was growing IN gangbusters to fuel a JJ JJ expansion . So DT company dutifully responded to market demands : PRP produced and sold oil to turn a profit . Nearly three decades later , Shell ’s business model is shifting by DT same market - driven calculus . Despite advertising WDT depicts DT oil giant as environmentally friendly , its decision to reduce reliance on oil is not born of benevolence . PRP ’s reacting to market forces . A 2019 McKinsey report predicts IN declining gas consumption in DT transport sector , because of factors IN fuel efficiency and electrification , MD lead oil demand to begin decreasing in DT early 2030s . “ DT future of NN needs to evolve as something else , ” van Beurden says . “ And PRP find a role for ourselves in PRP . ” DT shift away from oil is not just a macroeconomic calculation . In 2018 , NNP Action 100+ , a powerful group of JJ investors WDT now represents $ 41 trillion in assets , delivered an ultimatum : either Shell committed to short - term NNS - reduction targets , or PRP risked losing DT support of some of its largest shareholders . While NNP Action 100 + held little formal power over Shell , DT investors MD wreak havoc within DT company by opposing management in shareholder votes , a process where shareholders can force management to take specific actions . In an extreme case , DT investors MD ditch their Shell stock –which MD undermine share prices , tank DT company ’s valuation and drag down executive pay . “ Politics might be pretty confused and babbling at DT moment , ” says Anne Simpson , director of JJ governance at CalPERS , DT largest JJ pension fund in DT U.S. , and a steering - committee member at NNP Action 100 + . “ But money talks . ” Meanwhile , a Dutch - led group of investors known as Follow This actually went ahead with a series of activist shareholder resolutions WDT , if PRP had garnered DT support of 75 % of shareholders , MD have required DT company to take aggressive NN action . While DT resolutions failed , DT threat was real . By December 2018 , Shell relented and , a few months later , made DT commitment to reducing NNS as much as 3 % by 2021 . Significantly , DT commitment included end - use NNS : DT company was agreeing to take responsibility not only for its own operations , but RB for how consumers use Shell ’s products . DT activist investors claimed victory . “ DT only reason Shell has made this leap forward is because investors started supporting our resolution , ” Follow This founder Mark van Baal told me . Shell ’s JJ commitment was part of a broader rebranding effort . For decades , Shell and other oil - and - gas companies portrayed themselves to consumers as essential to modern life . Their products power your car and warm your house . But over DT NNS , DT image has soured . DT 2010 BP oil spill and a series of journalistic exposés of DT industry ’s misbehavior stole headlines . Shell faced reports of corruption in Nigeria , where PRP has significant drilling operations , including its alleged complicity in NN human - rights abuses . Organizers say IN in September 2019 , more than 7 million NNS marched around DT globe , skipping school and work to demand IN their governments take action to reduce greenhouse - gas NNS . DT U.K. declared a NN emergency and prominent members of DT U.S. Congress called to eliminate DT country ’s fossil - fuel NNS by 2030 . In July , DT head of OPEC , DT oil cartel WDT in 2018 accounted for more than 40 % of DT NN ’s crude - oil production , called NN activists “ DT greatest threat to our industry . ” Widespread JJ criticism of Big Oil is perhaps especially damaging to Shell . Unlike JJ of its competitors , Shell purchases much of its oil from other companies , then slaps DT Shell brand on PRP , rather than digging DT stuff out of DT ground itself . DT means IN its consumer reputation matters more than , say , Occidental Petroleum’s . Shell RB faces scrutiny as a Netherlands - based company . While U.S. firms IN ExxonMobil contend with a relatively conservative political environment in Texas , Shell is headquartered in DT Hague , a city where PRP ’re more likely to VB hit by a bicycle than a car . In Amsterdam , 40,000 NNS took to DT streets last spring to demand action on NN NN , and some protesters carried signs with a version of DT Shell logo fashioned into a middle finger . In London , protesters demonstrated outside Shell ’s offices , graffitiing DT walls with slogans IN crime scene and Shell kills . “ Their own company is built on DT death and destruction of nature and of NNS all around DT NN , ” says Farhana Yamin , a lawyer turned activist who glued herself to DT cement outside Shell ’s London headquarters last April . DT National Theatre in London dropped Shell as a sponsor in October , just as PRP declared a “ NN emergency , ” and DT Dutch branch of Friends of DT NNP is suing Shell for reneging on its “ duty of care ” obligation under Dutch law . “ All of these initiatives add to DT pressure , ” says Freek Bersch , a campaigner at Friends of DT NNP Netherlands . Van Beurden certainly feels DT heat . In recent regulatory filings Shell listed its “ societal licence to operate , ” industry lingo for how society views DT company , among its key concerns . Shell executives now need “ to ask ourselves more questions than just , ‘ Hey , is this legal or not ? ' ” van Beurden says . PRP have to consider how society sees their brand . To witness exactly how Shell is changing , I visited CD of its biggest ongoing investments : a chemical facility outside of Pittsburgh estimated to cost $ 6 billion . When PRP ’s completed , DT nearly 400 - acre site will churn out more than a million tons of polyethylene every NN , DT base for a host of plastic products WDT MD become anything from packaging to toys to JJ devices to car parts . Activists describe DT facility as an environmental nightmare . Studies have found plastic in tap NN , in food products , and in DT bellies of NN birds and whales . And plastic production is a significant driver of NN NN . DT chemical sector is responsible for 18 % of industrial carbon - dioxide NNS , according to a 2018 report from DT International NNP Agency . NNS are expected to grow 30 % by 2050 . But , for Shell , DT investment is emblematic of its future business model . As DT company rethinks its business , PRP plans to expand in plastics . Shell ’s other big bet outside of oil is natural gas , which is RB controversial . When burned , natural gas produces less carbon than oil or coal does , but PRP ’s still much more polluting than renewable sources , IN solar or wind . But Shell is all - in : in 2016 , DT company maneuvered a $ 53 billion takeover of BG Group , an oil - and - gas company WDT focused on liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) , and two NNS later Shell announced PRP MD fund a $ 31 billion LNG - export terminal in Canada along with other partners . Shell is widely known as CD of DT NN ’s leading natural - gas producers . DT company argues IN natural gas is necessary to back up clean - NN sources IN wind and solar and to feed growing demand for NN in DT developing NN . DT company ’s least contentious area of NN is its investment in DT power sector , delivering electricity to homes and businesses . While DT power sector is widely seen as essential to reducing NNS , critics point out IN PRP ’s a tiny portion of Shell ’s portfolio . Shell is now spending up to $ 2 billion a NN building out its capacity to supply electricity –just a sliver of its roughly $ 25 billion capital expenditure , which is predominantly spent exploring and drilling for oil . But Shell is rethinking its oil business , too , in recognition IN its most expensive drilling ventures wo n’t work in DT future if oil demand slows . In 2015 , PRP ended its effort to drill in DT Arctic , and in 2017 PRP sold off billions of Canadian oil - sand assets . Meanwhile , Shell ’s total oil reserves have slowly declined compared with its competitors ’ . In December 2018 , ExxonMobil had more than 17 NNS of oil reserves stored , BP had nearly 15 and Chevron more than 11 , according to Bloomberg data . Shell maintained only 81/2 NNS of reserves . Analysts say PRP ’s too early to tell whether Shell ’s strategy to reduce reliance on oil will pay off for shareholders in DT long run . Last NN , Shell , while continuing to pay large dividends , bought back stock , helping maintain its share price . DT maneuver kept DT company ’s stock valuation roughly level , but PRP ’s hardly a workable long - term strategy . Across DT sector , companies “ have to figure out who PRP are in this changing market , ” says Tom Sanzillo , director of finance at DT IEEFA . “ PRP are not DT profit center WDT PRP used to be , and PRP probably never will be . ” DT viability of sticking with oil , even as major NN economies promise to move away , is uncertain . Both ExxonMobil and Chevron are staying DT course , hoping to outlast their competitors . But Shell and others are moving to adapt . BP , for instance , has RB invested in natural gas and power , while ConocoPhillips has prioritized “ short - cycle project times ” to help PRP stay economically competitive . Occidental has dropped money into a method of drilling WDT allows PRP to store CO2 in DT ground , a bet IN PRP can offset some of DT regulatory costs of CO2 NNS within its own operations . And in December , DT Spanish oil giant Repsol committed to being carbon - neutral by 2050 and wrote down JJ of its oil assets on DT grounds IN their value will diminish as oil fades . Meanwhile , DT landscape for DT NN remains bleak . To keep average JJ temperatures from VBG more than 1.5 °C above preindustrial levels , oil companies MD have to agree to keep trillions of dollars of oil assets in DT ground . So while Shell and others are taking steps in DT right direction to reduce total NNS , PRP are still barreling into a catastrophically NN - changed future . “ Shell is doing a lot of DT right things , ” says a senior NN official , who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely . “ DT question is : What award do PRP VB for being DT best - painted deck chair on DT Titanic ? ” Last spring , Shell announced IN PRP was leaving American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers , an influential oil - industry trade lobby . DT group ’s position on NN NN , Shell VBD , was incompatible with its own . Shell cited AFPM ’s lack of support for DT Paris Agreement and for carbon pricing . DT NN made a splash . Shell appeared to be firing a shot across DT bow to other powerful lobbying groups : DT politics on NN NN is shifting . VB with DT program or VB left in DT dust . PRP was DT latest in a series of similar moves . In recent NNS , Shell , as well as Exxon and BP , left DT American Legislative Exchange Council , a conservative political group , over its stance on NN NN . In 2014 , Shell and other major JJ oil companies convened to form DT Oil and Gas NNP Initiative to fund clean - NN ventures , and in 2017 , a consortium of JJ Fortune 500 companies , including Shell , Total , ExxonMobil and BP , joined with a handful of green groups to launch DT NNP Leadership Council to advocate in DT U.S. for a carbon tax WDT reflects “ DT conservative principles of free markets and limited NN . ” A related lobbying group has spent several million dollars lobbying Congress for DT proposal . Critics largely dismiss these efforts as too little , too late . PRP question DT companies ’ sincerity and suggest PRP MD abandon their support when push comes to shove . And , given DT scale of DT challenge , JJ argue IN DT NN has long passed for incremental initiatives . But given DT central role DT oil - and - gas industry plays in both politics and DT JJ economy , PRP ’s hard to imagine DT NN tackling NN NN unless DT industry either loses its political power or stops roadblocking NN solutions . DT rise of DT oil industry is intrinsically intertwined with DT rise of modern capitalism and DT 20th century market economy . Oil provided DT resources to power DT near nonstop GDP growth of DT postwar era . DT history offers DT modern oil industry immense political power , which PRP has used to block any legislation , including NN initiatives , WDT MD curb its profits . In particular , Big Oil has spent decades funding campaigns to discredit DT NN linking greenhouse - gas NNS to NN and later spent millions more on messages WDT downplayed DT catastrophic significance of NN NN . For DT most part , PRP have been successful both in blocking bills WDT MD have curbed NNS and in securing NN support for their business . Senator Sheldon Whitehouse ( D. , R.I. ) , who wrote a book on corporate influence in NN , told me he does n’t “ VB EX ’s ever been such political might assembled on CD issue in DT history of DT Congress ” as oil - and - gas interests fighting NN - VB regulation . Globally , fossil fuels receive roughly $ 5 trillion annually in NN subsidies , a figure WDT includes DT cost of environmental damage caused by industry WDT ’s left to everyone else to clean up , according to a 2019 International Monetary Fund paper . But if Big Oil ’s roots are deep , belief is growing across DT globe WDT DT industry ’s untouchable status needs to end . Beyond activists , JJ opinion in DT U.S. continues to turn against fossil fuels . According to a 2019 Gallup poll , 60 % of U.S. adults , including DT vast majority of Democrats and a large share of Republicans , support policies aimed at reducing DT use of fossil fuels . Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders , both of whom are polling at DT top of DT Democratic presidential primary , have promised to ban fracking–a move WDT ( though unlikely ) MD transform DT industry overnight . And , across DT Atlantic , a Green Deal in DT E.U. unveiled late last NN proposes , among other things , to create a JJ tax on imports WDT MD hit oil companies . Even DT Shell display at Madurodam , DT strange miniature theme park in DT Hague , has been condemned by activists . Basic JJ factors RB loom large . This NN , analysts expect IN JJ overleveraged oil firms in West Texas will likely VB bankrupt , and those WDT stay afloat will face withering headwinds . Production of low - cost shale oil means some established companies will need to continue to reassess their portfolio to turn a profit . Meanwhile , both geopolitical tensions in DT Middle East and disagreements over trade continue to rattle DT industry : JJ operations require safely and efficiently moving vast amounts of oil across borders . Despite DT gathering momentum to wean DT economy off fossil fuels , PRP ’re not RB yet . Analysts predict oil will continue to dominate DT JJ economy into DT early 2030s . And even as this transition takes place , Big Oil will likely continue to wield outsize political influence . In DT U.S. , DT coal industry is a shadow of what PRP once was as companies struggle to turn a profit , but DT NNP Administration continues to work on behalf of its barons . Oil executives MD , at any rate , prefer to avoid coal ’s fate . In his office in DT Hague , van Beurden considers DT uncertainty facing his company over DT next decade : souring JJ perception , shifting consumer behavior , DT risk of becoming activist investors ’ next target , political leaders ’ bold promises to dramatically reduce NNS . In this environment , van Beurden says , companies IN Shell must be ready to adapt . “ PRP ’s DT NN PRP live in , ” he says . “ I have to find a way to make DT most of DT . ” This appears in DT January 27 , 2020 issue of NNP ."

But as NN leaders gather in Madrid this week to refine their pledges to cut heat - trapping gases , a large group of NNP cities , NNS , universities and businesses remain committed to holding JJ NN below 2 degrees Celsius . Their message to DT NN ? IN DT NNP is still fighting to avoid DT worst consequences of NN NN . And despite DT policies of this administration , a JJ report shows IN this broad coalition is significantly reducing NNP greenhouse gas NNS and even deeper cuts are possible with or without federal help . DT report titled "" Accelerating America 's Pledge "" finds IN policies already in place by NN , local and business actors can reduce greenhouse gas NNS by 25 % by 2030 compared to 2005 levels . This current coalition of DT willing represents 68 % of NNP gross domestic product , which MD make PRP DT NN 's second largest economy , second to only DT NNP economy itself , according to DT report . "" PRP can say to DT international community , ' Hey , PRP guys hear a lot about what 's not happening in DT NNP , but what PRP might not VB is IN EX is a tremendous amount of activity WDT can actually make a difference in terms of overall NNP NNS , ' "" VBD Nate Hultman , director of DT Center for NNP Sustainability at DT University of Maryland and DT lead author of DT report . DT authors of DT report -- which was produced by DT "" America 's Pledge "" initiative led by Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg and former California Gov. Jerry Brown -- found IN even more significant cuts are possible with further shifts toward renewable NN , improved efficiency in buildings and transportation , and protection of forests and other carbon - storing ecosystems . If NN and local governments along with DT private sector further enhanced their NN commitments , overall NNP NNS MD fall even further by 37 % by 2030 , DT NN found . But DT report shows IN to VB DT NNP within striking distance of its Paris Agreement goals , executive and legislative action will be required . Mixed messages from DT NNP on NN NN DT report comes as NN and local actors try to carry on DT fight to halt NN NN without federal support and reflects both DT potential and limits of this current bifurcated NNP NN policy . But EX is a second group from DT NNP in Madrid -- a band of lawmakers , city and NN officials , plus private sector and educational leaders -- seeking to fill DT void of leadership PRP say has been left by DT NNP administration . Their goal is to convince DT rest of DT NN IN DT NNP is still in DT fight to avert DT worst consequences of NN NN . On Friday , DT NNP NNP Action Center opened in Madrid with a slate of speakers and events . During COP25 , DT action center will serve as a hub for an array of NNP leaders planning to show other NNS DT steps PRP are taking to combat DT NN crisis . "" Throughout DT course of history , DT NNP has been seen as a leader . And with an issue as pressing as this NN , PRP should n't take a backseat to anybody , "" VBD Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes , who is representing DT NNP NNP Alliance , a bipartisan coalition of governors committed to DT Paris Agreement goals . In DT absence of federal action to address DT NN crisis , this has become DT JJ normal . At DT past two major gatherings of NN negotiators ( COP23 and COP24 ) since NNP came into office , this alliance has set up shop on DT sidelines -- separate from DT federal delegation . "" CD of DT major concerns I VBP is DT way IN DT NNP has participated in these talks -- being in and being out , and then being in and being out , "" VBD Elan Strait , director of NNP NN campaigns at DT NNP Wildlife Fund . "" DT rest of DT NN is obviously very tired of DT . "" Both in DT NNP presidential election and at next NN 's COP26 in Glasgow , DT stakes are high when PRP comes to DT fate of DT NN . DT Madrid meetings this week are DT last major negotiations before 2020 , DT NN when DT Paris agreement goes into effect . Ahead of COP26 , JJ NNS will need to increase their commitments to cut NNS to VB on track to meet DT Paris goals . Though DT NNP has formally withdrawn from DT Paris accord , under DT agreement 's framework , DT process cannot be completed until November 4 , 2020 , which happens to be DT day after DT 2020 presidential election . Should NNP lose , a JJ NN MD rejoin DT agreement , but MD need to commit DT NNP to cutting its heat - trapping gas NNS even further ."

On Mondays , she wrapped herself in several layers , including a heavy - duty parka and bulky orange boots with superinsulated soles , and ventured into DT polar darkness . Driving snowmobiles loaded with equipment , she and her fellow researchers , on alert for cracks and fissures , caravanned over DT jagged surface of DT NN . After setting up a tent as a partial shield against DT wind and bitter cold , and wearing red-filtered headlamps to avoid disturbing light - sensitive microbes , DT researchers used a battery - powered drill fitted with a spinning circular blade and a three - foot - long barrel to draw about two dozen cores out of DT NN . For DT next several hours PRP carefully sliced DT cores into sections , calling out precise measurements for Creamean to record . Outside DT tent stood a guard armed with a rifle and a flare gun , scanning DT horizon for approaching polar bears . Creamean , an atmospheric scientist at Colorado NNP University , is CD of more than 300 researchers participating in a wildly ambitious , eye - wateringly expensive yearlong expedition called MOSAiC , DT Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for DT NNP of Arctic NNP . DT observatory in question is DT expedition ’s research vessel , a German icebreaker called DT Polarstern , which set sail from Norway last September . When DT Polarstern reached Arctic waters , DT researchers chose an NN floe WDT PRP believed was thick and sturdy enough to last through DT summer , then moored DT ship to DT floe and waited for DT NN to freeze around PRP . DT Polarstern and its floe are now indeed drifting across DT Arctic Ocean , and if all goes well , PRP will continue to do so until DT expedition ends in September 2020 . DT researchers hail from more than 70 institutions across 20 NNS , and IN DT polar explorers of old PRP are driven to understand CD of DT NN ’s grandest , most mysterious and least hospitable regions . But this is an Arctic their predecessors MD barely recognize — and DT is precisely DT point of DT expedition . Over DT past three decades , DT extent of Arctic NN NN in September , at DT end of DT summer melt , has declined by 30 percent . Since 2002 , DT record low for summer NN has been broken four times , and several other recent NNS have come close to setting JJ records . NNS believe this is in part because DT dark ocean surface absorbs more heat from DT sun than NN NN does , which is contributing to a worrisome feedback loop — NN leads to melting NN , which leads to more NN — promising more and swifter melting in DT future . Because DT Arctic plays such an important role in cooling DT NN , MOSAiC ’s goal is to understand how DT NN , atmosphere and ocean are interacting in a NN Arctic , and how those dynamics affect NN around DT globe . CD group of MOSAiC researchers is studying DT currents WDT move seawater in and out of DT Arctic , and how ocean temperatures affect atmospheric conditions as well as DT freezing and melting of NN . Some are studying DT cracks and gaps WDT form in DT NN as temperatures warm . Others are gauging DT levels of greenhouse gases in DT ocean and atmosphere . In addition , research aircraft were scheduled to begin flights from Svalbard , Norway , in mid-March to complement atmospheric measurements on DT NN , but PRP were delayed after a German - based team member tested positive for NNP - CD . ( EX is no indication IN anybody on DT ship was exposed . ) MOSAiC researchers are RB studying DT tiny organisms WDT live on DT NN and in DT surrounding NN , and Creamean is especially interested in these life - forms . During her NN on DT Polarstern , she studied microbes in Arctic NN and seawater she collected , measuring DT minuscule amounts of methane and other gases DT microbes digest or produce during their life cycles . She RB collected air samples to VB how algae , bacteria and other particles blown into DT air act as nuclei for NN crystals in DT atmosphere , “ seeding ” DT formation of Arctic clouds — clouds WDT in turn affect DT amounts of snow and sunlight WDT reach DT NN NN . DT work poses countless challenges . Fissures can form in DT NN and block DT way to established research sites , forcing DT researches to find alternative routes . DT temperatures plummeted to 20 degrees below zero . In mid-November , a violent storm opened up a JJ crack between DT Polarstern and its floe , knocking over a 100 - foot meteorological tower and threatening to snap power cables . But spirits remained high , according to Creamean , sustained by DT international camaraderie and even DT occasional soccer game on DT NN . During long hours in DT NN - coring tent , Creamean MD occasionally step outside and gaze at DT moon or DT stars and try to take in DT vastness of DT Arctic night . “ Sometimes DT blowing snow MD sparkle , and PRP ’d just be struck by DT beauty of PRP all , ” she says . “ To VB IN PRP were CD of DT very few NNS who had ever seen DT , who had ever stepped foot up RB — PRP was awe - inspiring . ” In early January , Creamean flew home to Colorado hauling an Igloo cooler packed with samples of Arctic seawater , NN and air . Over DT coming months , she ’ll identify DT bacteria , phytoplankton and other microorganisms in her samples from their DNA . Then , she ’ll mimic DT process of cloud formation in her lab , watching to see which kinds of microbes most readily seed clouds at subzero temperatures . Later , she ’ll repeat DT process with samples brought back from DT Polarstern during spring , summer and fall to observe how DT makeup of DT atmosphere changes as temperatures warm , DT NN melts , and microbes in DT surface NN are blown into DT air . Eventually , she hopes to pin down DT precise role microbes in DT melting NN play in DT formation of DT clouds . “ PRP ’s a small piece of DT puzzle , but PRP ’s a crucial NN , ” she says . “ If PRP can better understand how clouds form , PRP can better understand how Arctic weather and NN is affected by different processes — and how those changes will affect all of PRP . ”"

In DT NNS to come , as NN NN continues to bear DT blame for everything from bushfires , drought , hurricanes , biblical - style rainfall and even record snowfall , PRP might just look back at a recent NNP Nations ruling as DT tipping point for DT greatest - ever JJ migration shift . For DT UN has put DT developed NN on notice , and let ’s be frank , PRP is those prosperous nations PRP are lecturing to IN refugees will have a right to be relocated to from their drought - stricken , NN - logged or hurricane - devastated home NNS if DT conditions at home subject their human rights to a violation . What exactly constitutes NN NN in a legal sense here is anyone ’s guess , but DT ’s not a problem for DT UN to consider , as PRP has just kicked DT particular can down DT road for those nations besieged by NN migrants in , say 2035 , to deal with . DT judgement was made after DT ( unsuccessful ) claim of Ioane Teitiota , a man from DT Pacific nation of Kiribati , a collection of 33 islands threatened by rising NN levels who had applied for protection in NNP Zealand in 2013 , claiming his and his family ’s lives were at risk . Mr Teitiota was already deported from NNP Zealand in 2015 . DT NNP Zealand courts rejected his claim , and DT UN human rights committee upheld its decision saying EX was NN for Kiribati and DT international community to take affirmative action and relocate its population but – and EX was a big ‘ but ’ – DT future effects of NN NN evident in some NNS MD mean PRP MD be considered a violation of a migrant ’s human rights – thus illegal – to be returned home by a nation in which PRP were seeking to enter . This is DT sort of ruling WDT gives leaders and policymakers in DT nations of southern Europe in particular , as well as those further north , sleepless nights . Did someone say “ build a wall ” ? PRP see decisions being made about far - away lands WDT will have a sledgehammer impact on their own NNS in DT not - too - distant future . For JJ governments , PRP is hard enough determining who is and who is n’t a legitimate refugee claiming protection from religious , sexual or racial discrimination . Clearly identifying DT Chinese Muslims from DT Sudanes Christians or transgender Afghans is tricky on its own . Now PRP have to take a potential migrant ’s weather concerns into consideration ? Do NNS of drought – or is PRP NNS of flood – constitute a threat to someone ’s human rights ? Is DT heavy rainfall on DT coast of South America down to DT effects of DT regular menace El Nino , or something more long term happening on DT polar NN caps ? While DT NN in general – excuse PRP , Mr NNP – is starting to identify JJ of DT modern environmental phenomena as DT results of JJ NN , NNS even now are still a little fuzzy about DT particulars . And EX are so JJ issues to consider . EX are sinking islands , IN Kiribati and DT Maldives , EX are bushfires in Australia , EX are summer heatwaves in Greece and unparalleled rainfall in northern England . EX are targets , declarations , denunciations , forums , committees , NNS , politicians , religious leaders and even Swedish teenagers all creating a massive incoherent clamour from which PRP is impossible to distill any CD distinct message , apart from “ PRP ’re all gonna die , ” which most of PRP VBP anyway . And now PRP have DT prospect of those experiencing unsettling weather extremes and looking to migrate being given UN support in seeking to move somewhere less volatile climatically ."

""_'' Next_RB Getting_VBG Air_NN Traffic_NN Under_IN Control_NN","Russia does n't seem to care two bits about JJ NN , and PRP 's not hard to see why . Most Russians MD probably be happy if DT country was a little warmer . Officials even joke IN once NN NN has run its course , NNS MD start pouring into Siberia instead of trying to escape PRP . If DT polar NN caps melt any further , Russia MD be able to drill for oil and gas in DT Arctic Ocean , where PRP 's believed to have huge fossil - fuel reserves . For DT rest of DT NN , however , DT picture is not so cheerful . To say IN Russia is hesitant about tackling NN NN is putting PRP mildly . DT last NN DT NN tried to VB DT country 's cooperation on DT issue was in 1997 , during negotiations for DT Kyoto Protocol ( DT international treaty on limiting greenhouse - gas NNS ) . Because Russia is DT NN 's third largest source of NNS after DT U.S. and NNP , DT accord MD have failed without PRP . So DT treaty was written in a way WDT MD allow Russia to keep polluting as much as PRP wanted and grant DT country billions of dollars in NNS allowances to sell to other NNS WDT needed to meet their Kyoto commitments . As a U.N. official who participated in DT talks put PRP , "" Russia got DT sweetest deal : free money , no restrictions . "" But apparently even DT was n't enough . PRP took another seven NNS of painstaking negotiations  and promises from DT West to help Russia join DT NNP Trade Organization ( WTO )  to VB DT country to ratify DT deal . How DT NN will persuade Russia to take an active part in DT upcoming NN - NN summit in Copenhagen on Dec. 2 remains to be seen . NNS say this is DT last real chance IN JJ leaders have to deal with JJ NN before its effects become irreversible , and this NN around EX are few obvious carrots with which to bait DT Kremlin . ( Russia has since abandoned plans to join DT WTO . ) And Russia has already indicated IN PRP is not putting a high priority on DT talks . In June , NNP Dmitri Medvedev announced DT country 's NNS targets , which MD effectively see Russia spew 30 % more greenhouse gases into DT atmosphere by 2020 than PRP does today . "" PRP will not cut our development potential , "" Medvedev VBD at DT NN . Then , at a preliminary round of NN talks in Copenhagen in late October , Russia sent an even more disappointing message . DT head of DT country 's delegation , Mikhail Zelikhanov , a parliamentary deputy for Prime Minister Valdimir Putin 's NNP Russia Party , questioned DT basic premise of DT fight against NN NN . "" Scientific circles in Russia and elsewhere still do not have a VBN opinion on DT causes of JJ NN , "" Zelikhanov told DT group of lawmakers from 16 NNS in DT hall of DT Danish parliament . He suggested IN an international panel be created to VB whether or not JJ NN was DT result of human actions and whether PRP MD be stopped by cutting pollution . Zelikhanov is part of a growing chorus of JJ - NN skeptics in Russia . At a NN conference in St. Petersburg in 2007 , Sergei Mironov , DT speaker of DT upper house of parliament , told experts IN a process of "" JJ cooling "" was in fact taking place . As evidence , he cited DT paintings of DT 16th century Dutch masters , whose warmly colored landscapes , he VBD , showed IN temperatures were indeed higher back then . And last month , DT NN - run Channel NNP television station aired a documentary called DT History of a Deception : NNP NNP , which claimed IN a NN NN had invented DT idea IN pollution is to blame for NN NN . None of this bodes especially well for DT success of DT December summit . "" PRP will not be possible to finalize an agreement without DT participation of Russia , "" says Danish Prime Minister Lars Rasmussen , who is spearheading DT negotiations . "" PRP will need to engage Russia in this dialogue . "" This might be possible through concessions , though . Last month , Denmark put itself on Moscow 's good side when PRP became DT first country to approve DT construction of Russia 's Nord Stream gas pipeline through DT Baltic NNP . On Nov. 2 , Rasmussen received a sign of support from Putin on NN NN , albeit a slightly vague NN . "" Are PRP ready to support Danish efforts to promote DT ideas of DT post - Kyoto period ? Yes , PRP are , "" Putin VBD at a joint press conference with Rasmussen . A European official involved in DT negotiations says Russia 's fear of isolation MD RB compel PRP to cooperate . With DT U.S. and NNP taking DT lead in DT NN - NN summit and Brazil and India playing an active role , Russia MD be DT largest polluter and DT only major power not helping to solve DT crisis . "" PRP wo n't VB to be DT bad guy , "" says DT official , who spoke last month in Copenhagen on condition of anonymity . But another member of DT Russian delegation at DT October talks left little room for optimism . Elena Chistyakova , chief adviser to DT parliament 's foreign affairs committee , says Russia MD sign DT treaty  and DT 's PRP . "" [ Russia ] will drag out DT ratification as long as PRP can . And if PRP ratify PRP , then PRP 'll drag out DT implementation , "" she says . "" EX 's just no political will . "" Next Getting Air Traffic Under Control"

""_''","Refugees fleeing their native NNS due to DT effects of DT NN crisis in future NNS MD not be forced to return if their lives are in danger , DT NNP Nations Human Rights Committee VBD in a ruling Monday . DT committee anticipates a flood of "" millions "" of NN refugees in DT near future . DT first - of - its - kind ruling — which a U.N. official called "" powerfully symbolic "" — came in DT case of Ioane Teitiota , who applied for protection in NNP Zealand in 2013 . Teitiota claimed his family 's lives were at risk in his home nation of Kiribati , a country severely threatened by rising NN levels . And while he actually lost his case , DT U.N. committee took DT opportunity to make a broader statement about NN refugees . DT situation in Tarawa , Teitiota 's home island , "" has become increasingly unstable and precarious due to NN - level rise caused by JJ NN , "" his counsel VBD . Saltwater contamination and overcrowding on DT island have resulted in scarce freshwater resources and a growing housing crisis . In 1947 , South Tarawa was home to just 1,671 NNS . In 2010 , its population surpassed 50,000 after nearby islands became uninhabitable . By 2017 , Kiribati's population had soared to over 100,000 NNS . Additionally , storm surges and high tides have flooded residential areas . DT population of DT island suffers from vitamin deficiencies , malnutrition , fish poisoning and other ailments resulting from food insecurity . Unemployment has surged in DT region and diseases spread easily through overcrowding and poor quality drinking NN . "" Kiribati has thus become an untenable and violent environment for DT author and his family , "" DT case argued . NNS warn PRP MD become uninhabitable within decades . Teitota applied for refugee status in NNP Zealand after his visa expired in 2010 . He was forced to return to Kiribati in September 2015 — putting his life and DT lives of his family at risk , he VBD . Teitota 's application was rejected , but he appealed , claiming DT ruling violated his right to life . NNP Zealand 's Court of Appeal and Supreme Court each denied subsequent appeals , so he filed a complaint with DT U.N. 's Human Rights Committee . On Monday , DT U.N. committee issued its judgment in DT case . PRP ruled against Teitota — stating his life was not in immediate risk — but VBD IN NNS in places where NN NN poses an immediate threat to their lives MD not be forced to return . "" DT timeframe of 10 to 15 NNS , as suggested by DT author , MD allow for intervening acts by DT Republic of Kiribati , with DT assistance of DT international community , to take affirmative measures to protect and , where necessary , relocate its population , "" DT ruling VBD . In DT future , if DT NN crisis continues , governments MD be prohibited from sending NNS back to home NNS WDT pose immediate threats to life due to NN NN , DT committee held , and potential human rights violations caused by NN NN should be taken into account by nations considering DT deportation of asylum seekers . "" Without robust national and international efforts , DT effects of NN NN in receiving NNS MD expose individuals to a violation of their rights , "" DT ruling VBD , citing articles 6 and 7 of DT International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , ensuring NNS 's inherent right to life . While Kiribati's current situation was not enough to meet DT standards of an immediate threat to life , DT decision MD become significant as DT number of NN refugees is projected to increase . "" DT decision sets a JJ precedent , "" VBD Kate Schuetze , Pacific researcher at Amnesty International . "" PRP says a NN will be in breach of its human rights obligations if PRP returns someone to a country where — due to DT NN crisis — their life is at risk , or in danger of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment . "" However , DT ruling "" MD not apply to U.S. asylum decisions at this point , because DT court ruled against DT claimant , "" reports CBS NNP ' Pamela Falk , "" but PRP opens DT door to courts hearing NN claims in DT future . "" "" PRP is powerfully symbolic , "" a U.N. official told Falk . DT U.N. expects tens of millions of NNS to be displaced due to DT NN crisis in DT next decade alone . A 2018 NNP Bank report predicted IN 143 million NNS from South Asia , Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa MD be forced to migrate due to NN conditions by 2050 . "" DT message is clear : Pacific Island NNPS do not need to be underwater before triggering human rights obligations to protect DT right to life , "" VBD Schuetze . At DT NNP NNP Forum in Davos on Tuesday , NNP Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told Reuters IN DT ruling has broad implications for governments . "" DT ruling says if PRP have an immediate threat to your life due to NN NN , due to DT NN emergency , and if PRP cross DT border and VBP to another country , PRP should not be sent back , because PRP MD be at risk of your life , just UH in a war or in a situation of persecution , "" Grandi VBD . Wildfires , rising NN levels , crop destruction and floods are just a few of DT results of DT NN crisis WDT MD drive large numbers of NNS from their homes . "" PRP must be prepared for a large surge of NNS moving against their will , "" he VBD . "" I MD n't venture to talk about specific numbers , PRP 's too speculative , but certainly PRP 're talking about millions here . """

Sandy shorelines of JJ high - population areas and tourist hot - spots are threatened by erosion , NN NN and surging NN levels . At - risk areas include Surfers ' Paradise in Queensland , St Tropez , Honolulu , Copacabana , DT Costa del Sol and Weymouth . But researchers offer a glimmer of hope and believe a moderate reduction in greenhouse gas NNS MD prevent 40 per cent of DT predicted loss . Researchers from DT European Commission 's Joint Research Centre in Ispra in northern Italy analysed 30 NNS worth of satellite images of sandy beaches . NN author Dr Michalis Vousdoukas , who led DT research , VBD : ' DT results indicate around 50 per cent of DT NN 's sandy beaches are at risk of severe erosion . ' Half of DT NN 's beaches MD disappear by DT end of DT century under current trends of NN NN and NN level rise . ' DT situation can become more critical for small communities highly reliant on tourism . ' Sandy beaches occupy more than a third of DT JJ coastline and are valuable in JJ ways as PRP provide JJ income via recreation and tourism . PRP are RB very environmentally valuable as PRP provide natural protection from storms and cyclones . However , erosion , NN level rises and changing weather threaten DT coast 's infrastructure and NNS . Some NNS will be worse hit than others , with DT Gambia and Guinea - Bissau facing DT loss of over 60 per cent of their white sandy beaches . Overall , Australia MD be worst hit with around 7,500 miles ( 12,000 km ) of beach at risk . Canada , Chile , Mexico , NNP and DT NNP NNPS MD RB be greatly affected . ' Between a quarter and a half of DT UK 's sandy beaches will retreat by more than a hundred metres over DT next century , depending on how rapidly DT polar NN sheets melt , ' according to Professor Andrew Shepherd , Director of DT Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling at DT University of Leeds . DT researchers used computer modelling systems to forecast how DT beaches , in their currently depleted NN , MD deteriorate as NN NN worsens . Two eventualities of ' representative concentration pathways ( RCP ) ' for JJ NN were predicted , each representing a future of varying severity . RCP8.5 is DT highest level of projected greenhouse gas NNS and RCP4.5 features less intense NNS WDT span over a long period of NN . Researchers looked at how human activity and geological processes causes shoreline retreat as well as DT damage caused by storms to make their findings . Dr Suzana Ilic at Lancaster University VBD : ' This JJ research shows IN about 30 per cent and 60 per cent of low lying areas fronted by sandy beaches will be seriously threatened by erosion , due to NN NN under DT high emission of greenhouse gases by DT middle and DT end of DT 21st century respectively . ' Moderate reductions in greenhouse gas NNS MD prevent 40 per cent of this loss , DT NN authors suggest . Dr Ilic , who was not involved in DT NN , added : ' PRP is encouraging to see IN reducing NNS from a high to moderate level will result in a reduction of DT projected shoreline retreat of 22 per cent by 2050 and 40 per cent by 2100 .

Dickens is remembered as CD of DT most important and influential writers of DT 19th century . Among his accomplishments , he has been lauded for providing a stark portrait of DT Victorian - era underclass , helping to bring about social NN . Dickens was born Charles John Huffam Dickens on February 7 , 1812 , in Portsmouth , on DT southern coast of England . DT famed British author was DT second of eight NNS . His father , John Dickens , was a naval clerk who dreamed of striking PRP rich . Charles ' mother , Elizabeth Barrow , aspired to be a teacher and school director . Despite his parents ’ best efforts , DT family remained poor . Nevertheless , PRP were happy in DT early days . In 1816 , PRP moved to Chatham , Kent , where young Dickens and his siblings were free to roam DT countryside and explore DT old castle at Rochester . In 1822 , DT Dickens family moved to Camden Town , a poor neighborhood in London . By then DT family ’s financial situation had grown dire , as John Dickens had a dangerous habit of living beyond DT family ’s means . Eventually , John was sent to prison for debt in 1824 , when Charles was just 12 NNS old . Following his father ’s imprisonment , Dickens was forced to leave school to work at a boot - blacking factory alongside DT River Thames . At DT run-down , rodent - ridden factory , Dickens earned six shillings a week labeling pots of “ blacking , ” a substance used to clean fireplaces . PRP was DT best he MD do to help support his family . Looking back on DT experience , Dickens saw PRP as DT moment he VBD goodbye to his youthful innocence , stating IN he wondered “ how [ he ] MD be so easily cast away at such a young age . ” He felt abandoned and betrayed by DT adults who were supposed to take care of him . These sentiments MD later become a recurring theme in his writing . Much to his relief , Dickens was permitted to VB back to school when his father received a family inheritance and used PRP to pay off his debts . But when Dickens was 15 , his education was pulled out from under him once again . In 1827 , he had to drop out of school and work as an office boy to contribute to his family ’s income . As PRP turned out , DT job became a launching point for his writing career . Within a NN of being hired , Dickens began freelance reporting at DT law courts of London . Just a few NNS later , he was reporting for two major London newspapers . In 1833 , he began submitting sketches to various magazines and newspapers under DT pseudonym “ Boz . ” In 1836 , his clippings were published in his first book , Sketches by Boz . In DT same NN , Dickens started publishing DT Posthumous Papers of DT Pickwick Club . His series , originally written as captions for artist Robert Seymour ’s humorous sports - themed illustrations , took DT form of monthly serial installments . DT Posthumous Papers of DT Pickwick Club was wildly popular with readers . In fact , Dickens ’ captions were even more popular than DT illustrations PRP were meant to accompany . He later edited magazines including Household Words and All DT NNP Round , DT latter of which he founded . Dickens married Catherine Hogarth soon after his first book , Sketches by Boz , was published . DT couple had a brood of 10 NNS . During DT 1850s , Dickens suffered two devastating losses : DT deaths of his daughter and father . He RB separated from his wife in 1858 . Dickens slandered Catherine publicly , and struck up an intimate relationship with a young actress named Ellen "" Nelly "" Ternan . Sources differ on whether DT two started seeing each other before or after Dickens ' marital separation ; PRP is RB believed IN he went to great lengths to erase any documentation alluding to Ternan 's presence in his life . Throughout his career , Dickens published a total of 15 novels . His most well - known works include : Oliver Twist , Dickens first novel , follows DT life of an orphan living in DT streets . DT book was inspired by how Dickens felt as an impoverished child forced to VB by on his wits and earn his own keep . As publisher of a magazine called Bentley ’s Miscellany , Dickens began publishing Oliver Twist in installments between February 1837 and April 1838 , with DT full book edition published in November 1838 . Dickens continued showcasing Oliver Twist in DT magazines he later edited , including Household Words and All DT NNP Round . DT novel was extremely well - received in both England and America . Dedicated readers of Oliver Twist eagerly anticipated DT next monthly installment . On December CD , 1843 , Dickens published A Christmas Carol . DT book features DT timeless protagonist Ebenezer Scrooge , a curmudgeonly old miser , who , with DT help of ghosts , finds DT Christmas spirit . Dickens penned DT book in just six weeks , beginning in October and finishing just in NN for DT holiday celebrations . DT novel was intended as a social criticism , to bring attention to DT hardships faced by England ’s poorer classes . DT book was a roaring success , selling more than 6,000 copies upon publication .

Uehlinger explains , “ What DT Clintons rely on is most Americans do n’t really understand DT security procedures . So , PRP can throw up a lot of smoke and mirrors WDT confuses NNS and makes them VB IN this was not so much of a problem . But NNS in DT military and NNS in DT intelligence community understand this better , and certainly PRP is even worse than PRP appears . . . . DT fact IN she set up a private server , in and of itself , means she is guilty of a felony right RB . Obviously , by having a private server , she was conspiring to evade her signed sworn statements IN she MD uphold secrecy agreements . DT fact IN she simply established DT ( private server ) regardless of what was on PRP , she intended to VB around and circumvent DT law . Now , PRP had more than 100 highly classified emails on DT server , and DT fact IN this server is absolutely vulnerable to any Chinese , Russian or Iranian hacking , this is DT greatest disaster or mishandling of classified information at DT upper levels of DT U.S. NN in history . EX is no question about PRP . ” Does Uehlinger VB NNP ’s private server was hacked ? Uehlinger says , “ I MD virtually guarantee IN with 95 % certainty PRP was hacked .

Uehlinger says , “ PRP do n’t VB exactly what he gave out , but EX has been talk in DT press IN his schedule was given out . NNS of DT level , even their schedules are classified information . PRP cannot even begin to compare DT damage of General Petraeus ’ schedule , which is obsolete after a week or so , compared to highly sensitive information ( on NNP ’s private server ) WDT involve U.S. technical means . . . DT ’s so high in classification WDT DT FBI agents investigating her case were not allowed to see . This is a quantum leap in mishandling of classified information far and above anything WDT Petraeus did , and look at what was done to him , and compare DT to DT present inaction VBG on with Hillary NNP ’s case . ” On Iran ’s recent JJ push for ballistic missile development , Uehlinger , who is a 20 NN CIA veteran and is an expert on Russia and Iran , says , “ None of this is a surprise to NNS IN PRP . However , this is a surprise to this administration , which just has a willful blindness and an ideology PRP sticks to and does n’t VB to hear anything to DT contrary . PRP wanted to conclude something with Iran , and PRP was done , even though all evidence pointing to this MD be a disaster . PRP ’s an absolute disaster . PRP ’s unconscionable IN PRP can have a non-agreement agreement and release money seized by DT international community since 1979 . . . and unfreeze DT , and DT Iranians have admitted PRP are VBG to use some of DT money for terrorist activity . PRP are progressing with their missile activity and threatening DT NNP NNPS for daring to criticize them . . . . PRP are VBG to increase DT chances for war in DT Middle East , not decrease PRP . ” Uehlinger , who is RB running to be a Republican delegate in Pennsylvania , says Hillary not being charged MD be to DT advantage of DT GOP come November . Uehlinger explains , “ I have talked to some whose fear , their fear is IN she will be charged . If this happened at DT 11th hour , what might happen is Biden might be put up .

This_DT is_VBZ the_DT future_NN in_IN a_DT world_NN of_IN climate_NN change_NN ._.","EX is a strange contradiction at DT heart of our federal NN and its response to NN NN . While most of Washington has been woefully neglectful of DT crisis or outright denying its existence , what is arguably our most conservative institution — DT U.S. military — has begun taking DT crisis very seriously . GOP legislators might make nonsensical statements about how “ NN level rise ” is a “ left - wing term , ” but DT Pentagon is well aware of DT dangers IN NN NN — which PRP refers to as a ‘ threat multiplier ’ — poses for its installations and mission . After all , PRP “ ca n’t fight a war unless PRP ’ve got a place to leave from , ” noted General Gerald Galloway , formerly of DT Army Corps of Engineers . As JJ as 46 U.S. military bases were recently deemed threatened by DT heightened risk of flood , drought , and wildfire brought on by NN NN . Diving into DT armed forces ’ response to DT NN crisis , Michael T. Klare “ found PRP had some very interesting things to say about PRP . ” Klare , 76 , recently retired from Hampshire College , where he was DT Five College Professor Emeritus of Peace and NNP Security Studies . ( “ Well , now I work even harder , ” he laughs . ) DT author of 15 previous books and DT defense correspondent for DT Nation , Klare spoke with Rolling Stone about his forthcoming release , All Hell Breaking Loose : DT Pentagon ’s Perspective on NNP NNP , which is due out this November from book publisher Metropolitan . DT book synthesizes DT latest NN papers , statements and presentations by officials , along with personal interviews , to give DT most up - to - date perspective on NN as viewed through DT lens of those tasked with defending America from threats of all types . Klare ’s project began because he was “ studying DT intersections of NN NN , resource scarcity , and conflict ” and realized IN DT military ’s take on JJ NN was a “ vision of NN NN WDT is not a part of DT JJ discussion . ” While environmentalists point out DT ecological issues involved , IN habitat destruction and mass extinctions , “ DT military focuses on DT threat to human institutions and communities , ” he says . DT armed forces “ see DT greatest threats from NN NN being NN collapse and mass migrations WDT are VBG to create chaos around DT NN ” and lead to a lot of dangerous tasks WDT “ PRP MD prefer not to have to undertake . ” DT military began making some reforms to address NN NN under DT Obama administration , utilizing cleaner technologies through DT Army ’s Operation Dynamo , DT Marines ’ Experimental Forward Operating Base , and DT Navy ’s Great Green Fleet . Obama had put through an executive order in 2013 requiring all parts of DT federal NN to prepare for NN NN , but NNP rescinded PRP in 2017 . DT various military branches continue to build toward ‘ net zero ‘ installations and DT ability of each base to be self - reliant . “ At some point , [ military ] officers who view national security as a sacred obligation will have no choice but to confront those who persist in NN denial , ” writes Klare . DT NN MD VB NN NN is a hoax created by DT Chinese , but Klare ’s latest book shows WDT DT Pentagon plans to stay DT course in attempting to green its facilities , juggle multiple catastrophes at a NN , and prepare for DT possibility of , well , all hell breaking loose . DT idea of ‘ All Hell Breaking Loose , ’ in DT title of your book , what does DT mean for DT military ? PRP see their job as defending this country from foreign threats and DT is what PRP are trained to do . ‘ All Hell Breaking Loose ’ is a condition PRP fear in which PRP will be unable to conduct DT mission , to do their job , because PRP will be so caught up in protecting this country against NN NN threats or addressing its impacts on other NNS around DT NN WDT are collapsing because of DT effects . I take this concept from DT Cold War era of nuclear escalation WDT says PRP VBP from small - scale events to increasingly serious ones . DT military sees DT with NN NN as well . PRP see an increase in extreme storm events WDT affect their allied NNS and require a military response providing aid — and in DT U.S. itself , UH in Florida or Puerto Rico . But PRP look into DT future and see increasingly severe events IN extreme droughts bringing about DT collapse of entire nations . PRP see DT happening potentially in places IN Nigeria and Pakistan , leading to mass chaos spreading across continents . PRP see DT beginning in what PRP once called DT Third NNP but spreading to more privileged and wealthier parts of DT NN IN Europe , and bringing about upheaval RB , leading eventually to conflict among DT great powers as NN NN advances . Perhaps in DT Can PRP quickly walk PRP through DT ‘ Ladder of Escalation ’ model WDT PRP use for this book ? PRP write IN DT Pentagon began planning for what disaster experts call “ complex emergencies ” after DT East Coast was walloped by Hurricane Sandy , and IN PRP was DT triple - assault of Hurricanes Irma , Maria , and Harvey — combined with massive wildfires in DT west — WDT “ made DT nightmare palpable ” for officials . What is a complex emergency , and what do PRP mean to DT Pentagon ? DT U.S. Military has always played a role in DT aftermath of emergencies , providing food , NN , supplies , helping rescue NNS and more . DT ’s nothing JJ . But PRP find IN as NN NN advances and increases in intensity , these emergencies will become more complex . DT electrical grid will collapse . EX will be chemical spills WDT produce all kinds of NN effects . DT NN system itself will collapse . DT police services will collapse . And so DT military will have to play a much greater role than PRP ever have before , stepping in and playing DT various roles of governments and having to deal with lawlessness IN looting . In Puerto Rico , after Hurricane Maria , DT systems of NN basically crashed in JJ places . EX was no electricity or communications available and DT military came in and had to provide all of those services . EX is a fear IN in DT future these kinds of emergencies , complex emergencies , will increase in severity and in number — and MD occur simultaneously — requiring a vast commitment of military forces at a NN when maybe those forces are needed elsewhere . DT book talks about how NN systems will come under pressure because of NN NN , which MD give way to conflict . Any areas PRP should be particularly leery about ? Places IN DT NNS of northern Africa are already suffering terribly and PRP see DT currently with localized conflicts . But as NN NN advances , even bigger and more wealthy and powerful NNS will feel DT effects . I VBP NN is DT area where this will play itself out — NN shortages — and where two or more NNS share DT same source of NN : DT Nile River , DT Indus River and so on . CD WDT has caught my attention is DT Brahmaputra River . PRP originates in DT Himalayas and travels hundreds of miles through NNP and Tibet and then crosses into northern India , where PRP continues for hundreds more miles and then finally crosses into Bangladesh , joins with DT Ganges River and empties out into DT Indian Ocean . This is CD of DT biggest and most important rivers in DT NN for agriculture — hundreds of millions of NNS depend on PRP for growing their food . This river is threatened by NN NN because PRP derives from DT Himalayian glaciers , which are VBG to disappear , and DT river will likely diminish in flow . Meanwhile , NNP is threatening to dam DT river upstream and divert its waters to parts of DT country WDT are already suffering from NN scarcity . And India says IN DT MD be a cause for war because DT river is so essential to DT survival of their country IN PRP wo n’t let PRP happen . So DT is a scenario WDT worries me deeply . What are DT ties between DT globalization of DT economy , a JJ environmental system , and these complex emergencies ? How do those intersections potentially affect things IN pandemics ? First of all , NN NN is making pandemics more likely because PRP improves DT conditions for mosquitoes since PRP VBP hot , moist weather and DT is what JJ NN is providing them with in large parts of DT NN — including DT southeastern NNP NNPS . PRP ’re VBG to see more frequent pandemics in DT future . Globalization helps DT process due to DT ease of airplane travel and whatnot — PRP can facilitate DT spread of infectious diseases . I VBP this will create fears around DT NN , which will lead to quarantines , panics , and DT militarization of NN [ services ] . PRP ’ve seen DT at various stages in DT past few NNS , IN borders being sealed off . DT attitude will lead to a more militarized response to NN NN : fences , walls , and more . I do n’t VB PRP can solve NN NN or NN emergencies in this fashion , but I feel EX will be a tendency to respond DT way . What about other aspects of globalization ? Should DT migrant caravans be viewed as NN refugees , and how should DT U.S. respond ? This is a major political issue in DT NNP NNPS : How to address these massive migrations of desperate poor NNS from Central America who are fleeing violence and poverty and seeking refuge in DT NNP NNPS . DT claim is IN those NNS are JJ refugees and should find refuge in an intermediate country , say Guatemala or Mexico . But PRP is pretty evident IN NN NN is a driving factor in their migration because of pronounced drought in much of DT area . PRP ’s becoming impossible to grow crops RB and these are agricultural regions . So , yes , these NNS are fleeing NN NN . I VBP as NN goes on this type of thing can only become a more powerful factor in NNS ’s decision to move . And EX is VBG to be hostility to this process everywhere . JJ activists point out IN DT military has garrisoned DT NN with bases and is DT largest consumer of oil as a result . Is DT NN at all self - aware here ? Of course DT military is a big consumer of oil , and DT contributes to NN NN . But this is something WDT NNS in DT military are very aware of . PRP were drawn to this topic originally not by NN NN but by DT strategic implications of being all over DT NN and depending on a long logistical trail of getting DT petroleum RB . And DT logistical trail is very vulnerable to attack . In Afghanistan and Iraq , U.S. oil convoys were attacked all DT NN . PRP still are . In JJ circumstances , more soldiers died defending convoys than died in battle . DT military is very determined to reduce their dependence on fuel WDT MD be subject to interference . PRP is RB at risk from NN NN because these long supply lines are increasingly VBG to be struck by severe weather events just IN everything else will be . So even before PRP had any kind of green consciousness , military leaders were determined to try to reduce DT oil consumption of their forces . Now PRP are RB concerned about NN NN ’s impacts on DT JJ security environment , so PRP are RB trying to reduce their own contribution to JJ NN . And PRP ’re making some headway . Can PRP do more ? Yes . PRP can do a lot more . But I VBP IN PRP are showing IN PRP ’re capable of making progress in this direction . JJ NNS speak about a NNP War II - style mobilization to stop NN NN through a Green NNP Deal and DT JJ . But what does PRP say about our culture WDT NNS constantly VBP in these militarized analogies ? I VBP JJ NNS have difficulty with DT notion , and I ’m RB ambivalent about whether a military metaphor is DT right NN . NNS sometimes do speak about DT Apollo Project [ DT ambitious mission to VB to DT moon ] , which I find a more comfortable notion of what PRP have to do . DT U.S. Military , when PRP speak about what PRP have to accomplish , does not speak in those terms . PRP say IN ‘ PRP have a job to do , which is to defend this country against foreign threats ’ — very real military threats — ‘ and DT ’s what PRP VBP to do . ’ But NN NN counts as an impediment to their real job and PRP have to address this and overcome PRP . And DT means making its own bases resilient to NN NN and reducing their contribution to PRP . But PRP recognize PRP as a JJ problem and realize PRP cannot do PRP alone and have to cooperate with DT militaries of other NNS in making their own NNS resilient . So PRP see this as an area of military - to - military cooperation . I see PRP in a more positive light in DT sense . DT now - retired Navy Admiral David Titley has mentioned a fear of ‘ ungoverned spaces ’ — why are such power vacuums abroad so important to DT military and to DT domestic security apparatus here at home ? DT military talks about ‘ ungoverned spaces ’ as places where NN control has vanished . PRP can VB about a place IN Somalia where PRP once had a functioning NN WDT extended throughout DT country but has long - since disappeared . PRP have something WDT calls itself a ‘ NN . ’ Its reach does n’t extend much beyond DT city limits of Mogadishu . DT rest of DT country is pretty much ungoverned and PRP have lots of contending forces — various terrorist groups IN Al - Shabab , militias and more . These are areas where groups VBP DT can flourish and hatch plots against DT NNP NNPS . Will this occur here ? Certainly senior military officials in DT U.S. fear IN in DT event of mass environmental catastrophes in DT future , local governments will break down and EX will be lawlessness in this country and DT military will be forced to step in . PRP saw elements of DT with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 in NNP Orleans where DT police force basically disintegrated and vanished . DT military says IN with NN NN , DT number of these ungoverned spaces is VBG to multiply because NNS in Africa and elsewhere will not be able to cope with DT intense droughts WDT can lead to mass suffering and starvation , combined with severe weather events , food scarcity , NN scarcity and so on . PRP ’re just VBG to collapse under DT weight of these pressures , which opens vast areas of DT country to militia rule and terrorist infiltration . PRP see this in Libya , Mali , parts of Nigeria , and , of course , in Afghanistan . This is DT future in a NN of NN NN ."

Magnus does research in consumer behavior - related areas , often with experimental methods , and with an interest in how consumers are affected by various marketing activities . ” On September 3 , 2019 , at DT Gastro Summit on food of DT future in Stockholm , Söderlund conducted a powerpoint presentation titled “ Can PRP Imagine Eating Human Flesh ? , ” in which he VBD PRP must “ awaken DT idea ” of eating human flesh in DT future , as a way of combatting DT effects of NN NN . DT “ Gastro Summit – about DT future of food ” is being held at DT Stockholm Fair . RB , behavioral scientist Magnus Söderlund holds seminars WDT make most NNS raise their eyebrows . PRP are about DT possibility of eating human flesh – to save DT NN . Swedish - American writer / reporter Celia Farber reports for DT Epoch Times IN Söderlund argued IN since food sources will be scarce in DT future , humans must break down DT ancient taboos against desecrating DT human corpse and eating human flesh , and be introduced to eating things PRP have thus far considered disgusting–among them , human flesh . He called DT taboos against cannibalism “ conservative ” and NNS ’s resistance to PRP as a problem WDT MD be overcome , little by little , beginning with persuading NNS to eat worms and insects , then to tasting human flesh . In his talk at DT Gastro Summit , Söderlund asked DT audience how JJ MD be open to DT idea of cannibalism . Not JJ hands went up ; some in DT audience groaned .

Sign_VB up_RP here_RB ._.","NNP Explained is a collaboration between DT Conversation , Stuff and DT NNP Zealand NNP NNP Centre to answer your questions about NN NN . If PRP have a question PRP ’d VB an expert to answer , please send PRP to climate.change@stuff.co.nz As someone who has been working on NN NN detection and its causes for over 20 NNS I was both surprised and not surprised IN I was asked to write on this topic by DT Conversation . For nearly all NN NNS , DT case is proven IN humans are DT overwhelming cause of DT long - term changes in DT NN WDT PRP are observing . And IN this case should be closed . Despite this , NN denialists continue to receive prominence in some NN which can lead NNS into thinking IN man-made NN NN is still in question . So PRP ’s worth VBG back over DT NN to remind ourselves just how much has already been established . Successive reports by DT Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP – mandated by DT NNP Nations to assess scientific evidence on NN NN – have evaluated DT causes of NN NN . DT most recent special report on JJ NN of 1.5 degrees confirms IN DT observed changes in JJ and regional NN over DT last 50 or so NNS are almost entirely due to human influence on DT NN system and not due to natural causes . First PRP should perhaps ask what PRP mean by NN NN . DT Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP defines NN NN as : DT causes of NN NN can be any combination of : • None Internal variability in DT NN system , when various components of DT NN system – IN DT atmosphere and ocean – vary on their own to cause fluctuations in climatic conditions , such as temperature or rainfall . These internally - driven changes generally happen over decades or longer ; shorter variations such as those related to El Niño fall in DT bracket of NN variability , not NN NN . • None Natural external causes such as increases or decreases in volcanic activity or solar radiation . For example , every 11 NNS or so , DT Sun ’s magnetic field completely flips and this can cause small fluctuations in JJ temperature , up to about 0.2 degrees . On longer NN scales – tens to hundreds of millions of NNS – geological processes can drive changes in DT NN , due to shifting continents and mountain building . • None Human influence through greenhouse gases ( gases WDT trap heat in DT atmosphere such as carbon dioxide and methane ) , other particles released into DT air ( which absorb or reflect sunlight such as soot and aerosols ) and land - use NN ( which affects how much sunlight is absorbed on land surfaces and RB how much carbon dioxide and methane is absorbed and released by vegetation and soils ) . What changes have been detected ? DT Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ’s recent report showed IN , on average , DT JJ surface air temperature has risen by 1 °C since DT beginning of significant industrialisation ( which roughly started in DT 1850s ) . And PRP is increasing at ever faster rates , currently 0.2 °C per decade , because DT concentrations of greenhouse gases in DT atmosphere have themselves been increasing ever faster . DT oceans are VBG as well . In fact , about 90 % of DT extra heat trapped in DT atmosphere by greenhouse gases is being absorbed by DT oceans . A warmer atmosphere and oceans are causing dramatic changes , including steep decreases in Arctic summer NN NN which is profoundly impacting arctic marine ecosystems , increasing NN level rise which is inundating low lying coastal areas such as Pacific island atolls , and an increasing frequency of JJ NN extremes such as drought and heavy rain , as well as disasters where NN is an important driver , such as wildfire , flooding and landslides . Multiple lines of evidence , using different methods , show IN human influence is DT only plausible explanation for DT patterns and magnitude of changes WDT have been detected . This human influence is largely due to our activities WDT release greenhouse gases , such as carbon dioxide and methane , as well sunlight absorbing soot . DT main sources of these NN gases and particles are fossil fuel burning , cement production , land cover NN ( especially deforestation ) and agriculture . Most of PRP will struggle to pick up slow changes in DT NN . PRP feel NN NN largely through how PRP affects weather from day - to - day , season - to - season and NN - to - NN . DT weather PRP experience arises from dynamic processes in DT atmosphere , and interactions between DT atmosphere , DT oceans and DT land surface . Human influence on DT broader NN system acts on these processes so IN DT weather today is different in JJ ways from how PRP MD have been . CD way PRP can more clearly see NN NN is by looking at severe weather events . A branch of NN NN , called extreme event or weather attribution , looks at memorable weather events and estimates DT extent of human influence on DT severity of these events . PRP uses weather models run with and without measured greenhouse gases to estimate how individual weather events MD have been different in a NN without NN NN . As of early 2019 , nearly 70 % of weather events WDT have been assessed in this way were shown to have had their likelihood and / or magnitude increased by human influence on NN . In a NN without JJ NN , these events MD have been less severe . Some 10 % of DT studies showed a reduction in likelihood , while for DT remaining 20 % JJ NN has not had a discernible effect . For example , CD NN showed IN human influence on NN had increased DT likelihood of DT 2015 - 2018 drought WDT afflicted Cape Town in South Africa by a factor of three . Weather extremes underlie JJ of DT hazards WDT damage society and DT natural environment PRP depend upon . As JJ NN has progressed , so have DT frequency and intensity of these hazards , and DT damage PRP cause . Minimising DT impacts of these hazards , and having mechanisms in place to recover quickly from DT impacts , is DT aim of NN adaptation , as recently reported by DT NNP Commission on Adaptation . As DT Commission explains , investing in adaptation makes sense from JJ , social and ethical perspectives . And as PRP VBP IN NN NN is caused by humans , society cannot use “ lack of evidence ” on its cause as an excuse for inaction any more .

First proposed in 2008 to initiate a comprehensive action plan to combat NN NN in DT UK , DT Green NNP Deal ( GND ) has come to JJ attention , gaining particular traction in North America . Its vision goes beyond DT "" green , "" "" hip , "" "" vegan , "" and "" mindful "" lifestyle choices of a burgeoning elite social class or DT tried and failed policies of carbon - offsetting , cap and trade , and sustainable development of green capitalism . PRP proposes definitive steps to help combat impending NN crises and to give DT younger generation hope in DT face of rapidly accelerating socio-ecological breakdown and unprecedented inequality . PRP puts forward a plan to shift DT economy away from fossil fuels towards renewable NN ; to eliminate polluting practices in industrial production ; to provide affordable housing for all , free education and NN care ; to create jobs with dignified working conditions and security , and to promote racial , gender and socio-economic equity and justice . But for DT GND to work and , indeed , transform DT economy and our lives , PRP must be decolonial . This means , its application must VB hand in hand with a concerted effort to rethink relationships to land , labour , and our collective imaginaries from DT structural and historic injustices of Western - style development . DT understanding IN development policies and ideas rooted in European and North American notions of "" progress "" are destructive and exploitative by their nature must be at DT heart of DT GND . In seeking to build a JJ economy and another way of relating to DT environment around PRP , PRP must heed DT advice of indigenous NNS , in their historical and ongoing demands for cultural autonomy and self - determination , on DT need to restore a diversity of relationships with our environment . What does PRP mean to be ' green ' ? DT GND is meant to halt DT loss of biodiversity , DT degradation of soils , NN , and rapidly decelerate JJ NN to pre-empt further DT catastrophic impacts of NN NN WDT a failure to stay below two degrees of NN will bring . To achieve all these things , however , technological fixes , such as carbon capture and storage , bound to market economy forces cannot be DT solution . DT relationships PRP must develop with our living environment cannot depend on policies regulated by costly , unpredictable and market - driven accounting metrics , which defy DT speed and severity of DT social and NN shifts PRP are experiencing . While all efforts to put DT "" emergency brake "" on ecological degradation are needed , PRP must recognise DT roots of how today 's custodianship and caretaking of land and waters was established and how PRP is linked to Western notions of development . Our development trajectory has been marred by DT idea IN humans are DT overlords of DT NN , who have to tame nature and submit PRP to exploitation for their exclusive benefit . PRP implies IN human civilisation is somehow separate from nature , whose only role is to provide unlimited resources to feed and expand DT human material NN . DT separation between humanity and nature is RB implied in how environmentalism has been approached in Western societies . PRP implies IN environmental degradation is merely a symptom of bad management in an otherwise non-negotiable JJ development model . DT arrogance of this logic is deeply embedded in DT mechanisms adopted by DT international community to respond to social and ecological crises , including its sustainability policies . As long as PRP erroneously see ourselves as outside and above DT rest of DT living NN , PRP will continue to contribute to its destruction . A decolonial GND , therefore , requires repositioning ourselves vis -à - vis nature as an integral part of PRP - just as JJ indigenous peoples have consistently sought to do in their historical and ongoing struggle for cultural autonomy and self - determination . GND policies must not simply aim to rectify harmful human activity WDT destroys biodiversity , soil fertility , and greenhouse gas pollution but engender a completely different approach to producing food , building human settlements and meeting human needs . Under a decolonial GND , agricultural practices , for example , will have to be completely overhauled . Mass production and distribution will have to be phased out , as should DT current practices of optimising yields through monoculture farming . Instead , transitions are required WDT focus on regenerative agricultural practices to return nutrients to soils ; encourage and recognise knowledge passed down between generations farming DT land ; ensure healthy non-GMO food production WDT is affordable to all ; and rebuild relationships between producers and consumers . What is so ' JJ ' about PRP ? DT GND must RB adopt a completely different approach to DT human economy . First , PRP must recognise IN DT crises produced by capitalism cannot be solved by capitalism itself . Capitalism , much IN DT burning of fossil fuels which feeds PRP , should rather be phased out and replaced with a diversity of decentralised solidarity economies WDT put social justice and both individual and collective welfare at DT core of their mission . A GND can therefore only be "" JJ "" if PRP is premised upon a commitment to limiting and redistributing wealth , is oriented towards understanding well - being as sufficiency rather than ceaseless desires and ensures IN DT means of production are re-localised to transfer decision - making power to communities at DT frontlines of resource extraction . Second , any GND for DT NNP North must embrace degrowth , which means scaling down overall material consumption and NN use rather than simply making them more efficient , which MD still expand growth and enable further extraction . PRP RB means moving society away from wealth accumulation and expansion as a goal in itself and towards wealth distribution and social justice . In this sense , changing PRP 's lifestyle choices - buying "" green "" and eating vegan or organic food - is not a solution to environmental and social justice problems . Rather NNS require support systems to radically alter DT way PRP live and consume . These support systems might involve fostering conditions of solidarity , connection , and joy WDT are otherwise sapped from DT individuality of materialism masquerading as "" happiness "" . Doing so means IN learning to live with what is enough to provide for basic needs and good NN should not be seen as a sacrifice , but as something to gain . This is DT first step to building a society for everyone , radically different than DT NN PRP have now WDT favours DT pursuit of self - enrichment and indulgence . Third , DT GND must RB create DT conditions for poorer NNS to develop according to their own democratically chosen development path . For DT to happen , degrowth policies have to be coupled with decolonisation of DT JJ economy . Although DT age of colonialism is supposedly over , colonial dynamics still very much dominate relations between DT "" developed "" and DT "" developing "" and determine hegemonic patterns of production and consumption . If DT GND does not address DT uneven patterns of where production and consumption take place then PRP threatens to derail "" green "" or NN - efficient transformations in DT JJ South . For example , if DT shift to renewable NN is carried out without a parallel decolonisation of trade relations , then NNS IN Bolivia and DT Democratic Republic of Congo , rich in coltan , lithium , antimony , nickel and other materials used in green technologies , MD still face DT dangers of extractivism . Even if measures are taken to ensure IN renewable NN production does not contaminate and deplete NN , destroy habitats , and displace communities - hardly likely in any JJ model predicated on optimising outcomes while minimising costs - unequal JJ relations MD doom these NNS to a JJ form of domination known as "" green colonialism "" . A decolonial GND must therefore prioritise restructuring JJ trade relations and reversing DT enormous imbalances of cultural , JJ and political power between Western governments and DT JJ South . When DT prefixes of "" green "" and "" JJ "" are removed , PRP are left with "" deal "" . This requires understanding what DT current "" deal "" is and why PRP must be fundamentally restructured . Apart from embracing workers ' rights and progressive social policies , a decolonial GND must RB actively interrogate DT racial , gender and class supremacies which have ruled DT NN and extracted wealth for DT benefit of a privileged minority for centuries . This is because , DT ongoing and increasingly dire ecological collapse is very much DT result of a perverse "" social contract "" in which patriarchy , capitalism and white supremacy shape human behaviour . PRP live in a NN where black , brown , feminine , queer and working - class bodies have faced unthinkable acts of violent dehumanisation under DT banner of contemporary Western development . This way of making and shaping DT NN and its inhabitants has not gone away with DT introduction of symbolic laws forbidding discrimination . PRP remains fundamental to DT socio- JJ relations which dominate our lives and which tie ecological destruction and racialised cheap labour to DT maintenance of uneven relations of trade across DT NN . Take historical plantations as an example . DT production of commodities IN sugar and cotton involved both DT brutal enslavement of NNS and DT ruthless abuse of DT environment , which led to severe deforestation , soil erosion and habitat destruction . DT goods extracted through violent exploitation of both humans and nature were then sold for DT benefit of wealthy white settler colonialists . This plantation model has not fundamentally changed since slavery was officially abolished . PRP has rather become more sophisticated with DT liberalisation of DT economy and DT advent of digital technology which today ensures greater predictability and control in yields , labour hours and profits . Today , agriculture and other sectors around DT NN are still dependent on a largely racialised and marginalised labour force , coerced in myriad ways to accept harsh working conditions . And again DT outcomes are DT same : destruction of DT environment and ever - burgeoning profit for a select few . A decolonial GND must break DT bonds of DT plantation model of social relations by introducing a JJ "" social contract "" rooted in ethical and political commitment to social , racial and gender justice . PRP must seek to establish a completely JJ set of rules for socio- JJ relations in our society - CD based on acceptance , respect for human life and dignity , solidarity , and equity . Under a decolonial GND , temporary , underpaid employment will be discontinued . Job creation will be generated by DT JJ transformation away from fossil fuels and overexploitation of resources and towards worker - owned renewable NN and DT relocalisation of industry WDT puts collective interests over individual ones . Jobs will have to pay enough for DT employee to sustain a dignified life ; PRP will have to provide social security and desirable working conditions WDT are free of abuse and discrimination and stimulate creativity . Worker - owned cooperatives MD be CD model to follow to create jobs and provide various community services , from NN care and child care to recycling and security . However , this will only work if cooperatives are themselves embedded in globally decolonised economies geared towards responsible relations between NNS and DT land . A decolonial GND must RB recognise and seek to compensate for DT ills IN centuries of racial , gender and social oppression have produced . PRP must , therefore , pay special attention to historically marginalised groups and indigenous communities dispossessed of their lands and ways of knowing and being . As part of this transformation , PRP should RB make provisions for reparations for colonial injustices . Thus , I suggest three organising principles for a decolonial GND : 1 ) "" VBG green "" must rethink and experiment in alternative human relationships to each other and to non-humans , rooted in reciprocity and responsibility . 2 ) DT NN economy must be reoriented towards principles of degrowth , decolonisation and relocalisation 3 ) DT unequal power relations underlying DT "" social contract "" of Western development models must be democratised to eliminate discrimination and racial supremacy in all its forms . For a GND to work however , PRP can not be limited to discussions and action within DT borders of a single country or region . DT dehumanising and ecologically destructive forces of capitalism have proven to adhere to no borders , so any response strategies under a GND must have a JJ scope . A GND requires collective commitment to resist oppressive forces WDT are literally waging a war against a good life for all . This means political resistance and action in DT streets , each in their own way responding to DT induced austerity policies of NN and market WDT together reinforce DT "" social contract "" responsible for ecological collapse . At DT same NN , "" decolonial "" cannot be another prefix to tack on along with "" green "" and "" JJ "" to make a status - quo development "" deal "" appear more inclusive . PRP must recognise both DT JJ power of Western development models in organising NNS and nature in violent ways , but RB more regional and historically - specific variants . These MD include DT subjugation of NNS and their relationships to DT land in places IN Kashmir or West Papua and DT rising demonisation of indigenous worldviews in Brazil and Bolivia . A decolonial GND requires constant learning , building mutual consent and trust , and self - reflection of DT embedded thought processes and habitus patterns WDT PRP all hold in contributing to such oppression , whether PRP realise PRP or not . PRP have reached a point of no return and PRP must realise IN EX is no saviour and no quick - fix solution for DT NN catastrophe PRP currently face . While DT "" mess "" PRP are in was not created by all of humanity equally ( and PRP must recognise this ! ) , PRP is a "" mess "" of such proportions WDT PRP need committed and unconditional solidarity to VB ourselves out of PRP .

( Lauren Radack / San Diego Gas & Electric via AP ) NNP YORK ( AP ) — As JJ temperatures creep higher and DT risk of deadly wildfires grows , utilities in DT West are struggling to respond to DT threat . San Diego Gas & Electric was ahead of DT curve when PRP began strengthening its wildfire prediction and electricity distribution systems a decade ago . At DT NN , some of its decisions were unpopular . But now , while its northern neighbor Pacific Gas & Electric confronts a so - called NN NN bankruptcy after its equipment sparked DT deadliest wildfire in NN history , DT Southern California company is viewed as a model for how utilities as far - flung as Australia can prepare for DT worst impacts of NN NN . SDG&E invested $ 1.5 billion over a decade swapping wood poles for steel , hiring meteorologists , deploying helicopters with infrared inspection capabilities and building a sophisticated weather monitoring system with mountaintop cameras and about 200 stations which capture 200,000 weather - related data points daily . Caroline Winn , chief operating officer , was at SDG&E when its equipment sparked a deadly wildfire in 2007 , and she was CD of thousands to evacuate her home . She reflected on how DT company ’s culture changed after DT disaster and how executives ’ attitudes about DT role NN companies play in NN NN has shifted dramatically . DT conversation has been edited for clarity and length . Q : What prompted San Diego Gas & Electric to invest so heavily in overhauling its operations to reduce DT risk of wildfires ? A : Our journey began over a decade ago when DT San Diego region really experienced DT unprecedented levels of destruction from firestorms in October of 2007 . Those fires were among DT most destructive in California history at DT NN . Unfortunately , EX were lives lost and EX were hundreds of structures , including those WDT belong to our employees , WDT were damaged or lost , and around 500,000 acres were scorched . On DT day , PRP knew IN DT National Weather Service had called for a red flag event , but DT ’s about all PRP knew . So when DT fires broke out , PRP were really in a reactive mode . PRP affected so JJ of PRP in this company on such a personal level WDT ... keeping our infrastructure from causing any fires became this rallying call across DT company . PRP really shifted from being focused on keeping DT lights on — because DT was really our main focus — to DT most important attribute becoming keeping our communities safe . EX was n’t a prescriptive plan WDT existed in terms of how PRP should design , engineer , construct or maintain our infrastructure against DT increasing threat of violent fires . EX was n’t a blueprint on how to develop and build out what MD become CD of our largest utility - owned weather networks . Back in 2007 DT belief in NN NN was n’t what PRP is today . But CD thing was really clear to PRP : PRP experienced NN conditions WDT PRP had never experienced in previous decades . Q : Your company began proactively shutting off DT power to reduce wildfire risks in 2013 . How did customers react initially and how was DT changed ? A : PRP was really met with fierce opposition from DT NN . PRP were DT first utility to do this and NNS did n’t understand why PRP had to turn off DT power for JJ safety . Despite DT harsh criticism , PRP stayed DT course . PRP held town halls after DT shutoff so IN DT community MD understand DT type of conditions PRP were experiencing . But RB PRP was important for PRP to listen to what our customers needed during these types of experiences . Acceptance of DT power shut - offs is significantly better than PRP was in 2013 . PRP VBP very few complaints because I VBP PRP understand why PRP do PRP , and how PRP do PRP , in IN our goal is really to keep our communities safe . Q : How does SDG&E help NNS with limited financial resources tolerate blackouts ? A : PRP have partnered with DT food banks and Meals on Wheels so PRP ’re able to provide necessities to DT more vulnerable customers , whether PRP ’re income - qualifying customers or PRP have mobility issues or PRP ’re seniors . PRP really , since 2007 , grew deep relationships with these organizations because DT is our way to help every customer through these situations . Q : What are DT most important things utilities must do to prepare for NN NN ? A : I VBP about PRP in terms of our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas NNS . PRP ’ve installed over 3,000 electric vehicle charging stations in areas WDT do n’t have as much access to electric vehicle charging ... and 45 % of our electricity WDT PRP provide to customers comes from DT sun and DT wind . NN NN is impacting DT wildfire threat , but RB DT CO2 ( carbon dioxide ) and NNS of wildfires are tremendous . So if PRP can VB a chance of ensuring IN these wildfires , if PRP happen , stay small and IN utility infrastructure is not DT cause of PRP , then PRP really feel IN PRP are leaning in ... and PRP ’re adapting very aggressively and progressively ."

EX has been increasing friction and drama with NNP Obama over this address . All DT drama surrounding Benjamin Netanyahu ’s address to Congress can only mean CD thing — negotiations with DT U.S. and Iran to curtail its program are not VBG well .

In DT Middle East , PRP looks IN plans are being made to try to attack DT Islamic NNP , or ISIS , in Iraq .

DT U.S. will supply air power , but a few weeks ago , American military experts VBD PRP MD take around 80,000 top quality troops to defeat ISIS . DT operation is planned for DT spring of this NN . DT Federal Reserve is adamantly against any sort of audit . Fed Chief Janet Yellen thinks DT Central bank needs its independence , which some call total secrecy and non-transparent monetary policy . When asked to provide information about a recent meeting with DT White House and DT Treasury , Yellen VBD PRP were “ private CD - on - CD meetings ” and releasing any information as to what was talked about MD , according to Yellen , not be “ appropriate . ” DT Federal Reserve is not federal and is , in fact , a cartel of private banks . Finally , EX is record snowfall and record cold temperatures this winter . I VBP this makes PRP a tough sell for DT man -made JJ NN proponents . DT facts say DT NN is getting colder , and not warmer .

Helen Mountford of DT NNP Resources Institute VBD IN post - recession economies can see a surge in NNS : "" After DT JJ financial crisis of 2008 , for example , JJ CO2 NNS from fossil fuel combustion and cement production , more than offsetting DT 1.4 percent decrease in 2009 . "" This NN , she hopes “ low - carbon and resilient infrastructure ” MD be a priority in any stimulus package to avoid an uptick in NNS as economies recover . Here are factors WDT MD help and hurt DT NN , in both DT short and longer terms : Improvements in air quality : Hubei province , NNP has been DT big winner . Marshall Burke , a researcher at Stanford University , calculated IN DT improvements in air quality recorded in NNP MD have saved DT lives of 4,000 NNS under 5 NNS old and 73,000 adults over 70 . . Better air is saving more NNS than NN is killing , in other words . Traffic is down in some of Europe ’s dirtiest cities , which have chronically failed to respect EU air quality limits . Industry shut - downs reduce NNS : A NN by specialist outlet Carbon Brief found IN in NNP , carbon dioxide NNS have fallen by around 25 percent , and declining oil demand should push NNS down globally . Airlines are RB cutting flights . Beware : If passengers are flying on half - empty planes , fewer flyers does not equal fewer NNS . Minds MD open for structural NN : DT focus is on NN and supply chains right now . But DT process of challenging assumptions and fundamentally altering behavior — illustrated by remote work — can be seized on by NN action advocates once DT worst of this NN crisis is over . JJ financial institutions will push green stimulus : Green investment is a pet interest of Kristalina Georgieva ( International Monetary Fund head ) and Christine Lagarde ( European Central Bank NN ) , while DT European Investment Bank is already getting out of coal . Look for regional and JJ bodies to push green investment incentives . Low oil prices make PRP harder for DT dirtiest oil to compete , and easier to cut subsidies : Oil prices are at four - NN lows thanks to DT collapse of DT OPEC + oil cartel , as Russia seeks to drive American oil shale producers out of DT market ( PRP MD prove too expensive for shale companies to extract their oil in a low - price environment ) . Meanwhile , governments reluctant to cut for car fuel and heating oil , can now do so with less political pain . FOUR WAYS CORONA WILL HURT DT ENVIRONMENT : Political and financial capital will be diverted : Governments will be forced to prioritize JJ NN and struggling banks MD VB lending criteria , and use DT crisis to revise their green targets . Mountains of waste : Coffee chain Starbucks to stop accepting reusable cups from its customers — now PRP ’s only serving drinks in disposable single - use cups WDT are recyclable . NNP is drowning under JJ waste ( often single - use items by necessity ) produced by hospitals . In DT city of Wuhan , PRP ’s to more than 200 tons a day . Home NN use will VB up : With oil prices down , more NNS working from home and JJ transport a place where NN spreads , consumer NN use will VB up . Take demand for home entertainment : Germany ’s Deutsche Commercial Internet Exchange interconnection platform , or , reported a record throughput of data this week . Low profits reduce what a company can invest in risky and long - term bets . Regulation MD force a shift to clean NN , but DT ’s unlikely in DT NNP NNPS and NNP in a NN when DT industry is suffering financial losses . EUROPE AND CANADA STICK TO DT GREEN SCRIPT … MOSTLY : Canadian Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson told reporters Tuesday IN he expects NN NN to remain a central focus of DT 2020 Canadian budget , despite DT need for emergency NN measures . "" Canadians RB told PRP IN NN is a huge priority and DT will be reflected when PRP see DT budget , "" he VBD . On Tuesday , DT U.K. NN gave electric cars and carbon capture a boost in its 2020 budget . In Brussels , DT European Parliament chose to delay a NN law debate . DT European Commission ( DT EU ’s executive ) pushed ahead to launch a green industrial strategy , including support for hydrogen technologies .

DT NN and stories WDT matter , delivered weekday mornings . Catch a glimpse of Katy Ayers paddling her canoe on a Nebraska lake this summer and PRP might do a double take . At first glance , her 8 - foot vessel looks much IN any other canoe — same oblong shape , same pointed ends , same ability to float on NN . But upon closer inspection , PRP ’s clearly anything but ordinary : Ayers ’ canoe is made out of mushrooms . More specifically , her boat is made from mycelium , DT dense , fibrous roots of DT mushroom WDT typically live beneath DT soil . Ayers , 28 , a student at Central Community College in Columbus , Nebraska , even gave her creation a fitting name : “ Myconoe . ” Though Ayers has taken DT canoe out for several quasi- recreational excursions — and plans to do so again as soon as DT weather warms up in DT rural part of Nebraska where she lives — her real goal with DT eye - catching project is to raise broader awareness about mushrooms . She is part of a growing movement of mushroom advocates , NNS who believe these squishy , sometimes edible fungi can help solve some of our most pressing environmental problems . In addition to their ability to break down harmful pollutants and chemicals , Ayers pointed out IN mushrooms can be used for everything from household insulation to furniture to packaging , replacing plastics , Styrofoam and other materials WDT are hard to recycle and harmful to DT environment . “ Mushrooms are here to help PRP — PRP ’re a gift , ” Ayers VBD . “ EX ’s so much PRP can do with them beyond just food ; PRP ’s so limitless . PRP ’re our biggest ally for helping DT environment . ” Mushrooms are n't exactly mainstream , though citizen NNS IN Ayers and some private companies hope to someday VB DT . DT NNP York - based biotech company Ecovative Design , for instance , has made headlines for its mushroom - based packaging material , which has been deployed by companies such as Ikea and Dell . Mushrooms are being used at DT local level to help clean up toxic debris and contaminated soil — a process known as mycoremediation — but so far have not been adopted on a larger scale . Ayers never paid much attention to mushrooms until she enrolled in 2018 at DT college in Columbus , a small city with around 23,000 residents . During her first semester , an English instructor challenged students to find and VB a potential solution to NN NN . During her research , Ayers came across a 2013 documentary called “ Super Fungi , ” which made DT case for mushrooms as an environmental ally and highlighted some of their innovative uses . Ayers was sold on DT power of mushrooms instantly . Having learned IN mycelium is buoyant and waterproof , she decided to try using PRP to create a boat . “ I always have very big ideas , ” she VBD . “ So I see something and PRP ’s small and I just VBP to make PRP bigger and better . Since I ’m from Nebraska , I love to fish . I ’ve always wanted a boat . Why not just grow PRP ? ” With a mini -grant from DT college , Ayers got to work . She reached out to a mushroom company in nearby Grand Island for help , sharing her idea with owner Ash Gordon . He agreed to help immediately and offered her a summer internship so she MD learn DT ins and outs of fungi . During DT day , Ayers worked alongside Gordon at Nebraska Mushroom , doing lab work , creating spawn and harvesting , packaging and processing mushrooms . After finishing their work for DT day , DT two turned their attention to DT canoe project . PRP first built a wooden skeleton and a hammock - JJ structure to suspend DT boat - shaped form in DT air . PRP next sandwiched DT boat ’s skeleton with mushroom spawn and let nature take over . For two weeks , DT fledgling canoe hung inside a special growing room in Gordon ’s facility , where temperatures ranged between 80 and 90 degrees and DT humidity hovered between 90 to 100 percent . DT last step in DT process was to let DT 100 - pound boat dry in DT Nebraska sun . All told , Ayers VBD she spent $ 500 on spawn , tools and equipment to build DT canoe . Ayers , who displayed her “ Myconoe ” at DT 2019 Nebraska NNP Fair , has taken DT canoe out for three test floats , including CD in which two NNS comfortably sat inside . DT boat is still alive , which means PRP fruits — grows mushrooms — each NN PRP take PRP out for a paddle . DT successful mycelium canoe inspired Ayers and Gordon to experiment with making chairs , landscaping bricks and other items . Though PRP started as a hands - on learning opportunity for Ayers in DT course of her collegiate studies , DT canoe has RB served as a quirky conduit for conversations about mushrooms . “ PRP ’s not just a piece of art , this is a functioning boat WDT works , ” Gordon , 39 , VBD . “ PRP really helps bridge DT gap between NNS who did n’t have an interest in mushrooms — maybe PRP do n’t VB to eat mushrooms and really have n’t thought about other potential uses for them . DT boat gave them something to look at and VB about . ” Now Ayers is sharing her newfound fungi fabrication knowledge with other students at DT community college . She ’s part of Growing Pathways to STEM , a full - ride scholarship program funded by DT National NNP Foundation WDT aims to help low - income and underserved undergraduates studying NN , technology , engineering and math . Ayers is leading CD of DT cohort ’s main research projects : building bee hotels , small structures RB called nests or homes , from mycelium . Inspired by research from Washington NNP University , which found IN honeybees who consumed mycelium extract had lower levels of a harmful NN , Ayers and her classmates hope to better understand DT effects of mycelium on Nebraska ’s solitary bees . Though DT community college closed all campus buildings in early April to prevent DT spread of DT NN , Ayers is keeping DT project alive in her basement while taking online classes . In addition to her full - NN course load , Ayers works as DT community college ’s sustainability intern , keeping tabs on NN use across DT community college system ’s seven campuses and centers . DT internship , which Ayers has RB been able to continue remotely , and self - led mushroom research projects are just DT start : After graduating with an associate ’s degree in NN , Ayers plans to earn a bachelor ’s degree in biology and , later , a doctorate in mycology . And after DT ? Save DT NN . “ She has an innate desire to VB DT NN , ” VBD Lauren Gillespie , a biological sciences instructor at Central Community College and Ayers ’ adviser . “ She believes IN she can do PRP , and I believe IN she can do PRP . ”"

Pfizer , for example , estimates PRP lost $ 195 million in inventory and overhead when three Puerto Rico manufacturing facilities were wiped out by DT recent devastating hurricane season .

Wildfires , too , can have an extreme impact — even if PRP occur further afield . For more than a week in November , wildfires in California sent enough small particles into DT air IN PRP became “ unhealthy ” for residents to breathe without filters — and MD have damaged DT air filters WDT research labs do use . “ DT R&D WDT fuels innovative activity in life sciences companies requires conditions WDT are tightly controlled , particularly when PRP comes to air quality , temperature , and other NN settings , ” VBD Will Zasadny , DT California Life Sciences Association ’s communications director . In addition to issues around DT power grid and DT impact DT fires had on employees , he VBD , “ wildfire smoke is damaging on air filtration systems . ” Recent experiences at two research facilities — CD in NNP York and CD in Texas — RB help illustrate DT potential pitfalls for earlier - stage life NN research — as well as DT promise for facilities WDT prepare for extreme weather in advance . When Hurricane Sandy hit NNP York City in 2012 , some of DT facilities at NYU Langone , an academic JJ center with a hospital and research facilities , flooded and lost power — including two of its animal care facilities . As some NNS carried out temperature - sensitive samples in bins filled with dry NN , others delivered NN to DT center ’s aquariums and evacuated DT mice and rats WDT PRP MD . Not all of DT research animals made PRP out . According to a National Academies of NNP report on disaster resilience , 35,000 mice — which represented about $ 25 million and about CD - third of DT system ’s total mouse population — died . “ In a way , DT NN are DT ones who lost , ” VBD Jennifer Pullium , DT director of NYU Langone ’s division of laboratory animal resources . “ DT purpose of these animals is for biomedical research — to improve DT quality of life and NN of NNS . When progress is set back , progress for NNS is set back . ” IN JJ places affected by a disaster , NYU Langone planned to rebuild itself without DT same soft spots . DT meant installing JJ flood barricades and moving critical things IN generators and computers up to higher floors — but RB making non-flood related modifications , IN making sure DT system ’s hospitals had air conditioners hooked up to DT emergency power network . “ Something IN [ Sandy ] really does help crystallize and motivate a lot of action and a lot of thinking WDT MD n’t happen otherwise , ” VBD Paul Schwabacher , NYU Langone ’s senior vice NN of facilities management . “ PRP did allow PRP to make a lot of changes and improve things beyond what PRP ’d been planning at DT NN . ” Langone ’s JJ defenses have n’t been tested yet . But Baylor College of Medicine ’s response to 2017 ’s Hurricane Harvey shows IN good preparation should pay off . DT college lost thousands of research animals in Tropical Storm Allison in 2001 — and spent $ 35 million afterward on better flood defenses , including food gates and pumps . When Hurricane Harvey hit in 2017 — a Category 4 hurricane WDT was CD of DT costliest Atlantic storms ever — DT college was ready . Baylor had a “ ride out ” team of 52 NNS , including some dedicated to taking care of DT JJ school ’s 100,000 animals while DT campus was flooded . None died . Most of DT major biotech and pharmaceutical companies have been preparing for NN NN for NNS . Johnson & Johnson and Novo Nordisk scored an A rating from CDP ; Sanofi , Pfizer , Roche , Novartis , Merck , Eli Lilly , Takeda , and Biogen all scored an A minus . GlaxoSmithKline and AbbVie earned B ratings , and Amgen and Bristol - Myers Squibb got C’s . DT ratings are based on DT company ’s awareness and management of NN NN issues . DT size and type of their investments in those preparations vary . Johnson & Johnson , for example , wrote in its report IN PRP underwent a full - blown review of its NN scarcity activities after a drought affected its facilities in Cape Town , South Africa . Biogen poured $ 500,000 into JJ software to monitor its supply chain after hurricanes and storms affected two of its major locations . Amgen highlighted its efforts to reduce NN use , spotlighting a facility WDT now reuses about 74 percent of DT treated wastewater PRP generates to cool its manufacturing equipment . In Cambridge , Mass . ’s legendary Kendall Square , CD local real estate developer has already worked to ensure IN a third of DT facilities PRP manages RB are prepared for extreme weather events all DT way up through 2050 or further . Those preparations are necessary in part because of where Kendall Square sits . A short walk from DT Charles River , DT biotech hub already faces a small flood risk from major storms . According to a recent city report , JJ issues MD start to crop up soon . By 2050 , DT NN around Boston should be a foot or two higher than PRP was in 2000 — so high IN DT city ’s report on NN NN vulnerability says DT dams WDT separate DT rivers around DT city from Massachusetts Bay MD be pretty useless . If a once - in - a - decade storm hits , winds might blow DT NN up from DT pond or river — a storm surge — or NN might come back up from drainage pipes . Alexandria Real Estate has over 4.3 million square feet of office space in Kendall Square . DT includes at least 1.9 million square feet of brand - JJ space built with NN NN in mind . Gone are basement electrical rooms and data centers — PRP ’ve been moved up to DT first floor . Thresholds for first - floor doors , too , are all above DT point DT city ’s reports suggest NN might ultimately rise if a major storm hits after DT NN levels around DT city have risen by a foot or two . Yet DT real estate company ’s not - inconsiderable power mostly stops at DT thresholds of their own buildings . DT company ca n’t stop a street from flooding or make sure DT city ’s drains wo n’t become overwhelmed with stormwater . Developers in Kendall have tried ; among other things , Alexandria and others have paid for a JJ stormwater drain WDT can take up to 630,000 gallons of stormwater . CD thing WDT Alexandria and others can do — and have done — is ensure IN their buildings wo n’t make flooding worse . Some Alexandria - owned buildings have equipment on DT roofs WDT can store stormwater for a while before its released — slowly — to DT street ; each site RB has a system in place to encourage rain to drain into DT ground first , not into DT streets . And specialized valves prevent sewer backups from bringing DT NN into a building . ( Even DT toilets will still work without adding to DT sewer ’s problems , at least for a day . ) “ PRP ’re confident IN our tenants and our properties here in Kendall Square are well - protected from NN NN vulnerabilities IN flooding , ” Andrews VBD . EX are less tangible risks to consider , too : DT prospect IN if a company ’s approach to NN NN is too timid , PRP MD be harder to recruit talented employees in an industry where sterling job applicants often have DT upper hand . “ As a NN - based company focused on improving DT quality of life , stakeholders MD set expectations related to Biogen ’s efforts towards NN NN , ” DT company stated — adding IN if PRP fail to meet those expectations , potential employees MD VB elsewhere . “ Loss of highly - qualified employees to competitors due to falling short of expectations MD place Biogen ’s research and development efforts at risk . ” Merck ’s report puts a more positive spin on DT issue . “ PRP recognize IN our policies and actions around social and environmental issues such as our carbon footprint can help attract and attain talent , ” DT company wrote . Yet to some , CD industry alone ca n’t make up for a broader failure to act . “ PRP MD seem IN , PRP VBP , as a nation , PRP should be doing much more to try to mitigate these risks . PRP ’re just tremendous , and I do n’t VB PRP ’ve reflected on DT cost of NN NN and other risks WDT are coming , ” VBD NYU ’s Schwabacher . “ PRP MD be doing more — should be doing more . ”"

A report by DT U.N. Environment Program , released just ahead of next week ’s NN conference in Madrid , revealed IN DT amount of NN - heating gases being pumped into DT atmosphere hit a JJ high last NN , with potentially dire consequences . DT report closely follows DT release of another U.N. finding WDT says planned production of coal , oil and gas is still too much to allow for hitting more aggressive goals WDT some NN - NN watchers have VBN are necessary . “ PRP need quick wins to reduce NNS as much as possible in 2020 , ” VBD UNEP ’s head Inger Andersen . “ PRP need to catch up on DT NNS in which PRP procrastinated . ” Man -made greenhouse gas NNS rose in 2018 to 55.3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide , according to DT U.N. ’s annual “ NNS gap ” report . While much of DT increase came from emerging economies such as NNP and India , some of those NNS are DT result of manufacturing in developed NNS , including DT U.S. and Germany . And Norway , for instance , touts its green credentials while PRP continues to drill for oil in DT North NNP . Levels of heat - trapping greenhouse gases in DT atmosphere have reached another JJ record high , separate data from DT NNP Meteorological Organization showed , backing figures offered by UNEP . DT WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin showed IN globally averaged concentrations of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) reached 407.8 parts per million in 2018 , up from 405.5 parts per million ( ppm ) in 2017 . “ This continuing long - term trend means IN future generations will be confronted with increasingly severe impacts of NN NN , including rising temperatures , more extreme weather , NN stress , NN level rise and disruption to marine and land ecosystems , ” DT WMO VBD in its release . To stop average JJ temperatures from increasing by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius ( 2.7 Fahrenheit ) this century compared with pre-industrial times , worldwide NNS of carbon dioxide , methane and other greenhouse gases will have to drop by 7.6 % each NN in DT coming decade , DT U.N. agency VBD . NNS say DT 1.5C target — contained in DT 2015 Paris NN accord — MD avert some of DT more extreme changes in JJ weather patterns predicted if temperatures rise further . “ What PRP are looking at is really IN NNS need to VB down by 55 % by 2030 , ” VBD John Christensen , lead author and director of DT UNEP - Danish Technology Institute Partnership . Even DT less ambitious goal of capping JJ NN at 2C ( 3.6 F ) MD require annual NNS cuts of 2.7 % between 2020 and 2030 , UNEP VBD . Right now , national pledges MD leave DT NN 3.2 degrees Celsius ( 5.8 Fahrenheit ) warmer by 2100 than pre-industrial times , with dramatic consequences for life on NNP , DT U.N. agency VBD . Getting DT NN back on track to 1.5C MD require a fivefold increase in measures pledged so far , PRP calculated . Last week , UNEP published a separate report , which found IN NNS are planning to extract more than twice DT amount of fossil fuels from DT ground than can be burned in 2030 if DT 1.5C target is to be met . Read : Bill Gates - backed Heliogen ’s solar ‘ breakthrough ’ MD replace fossil fuels in steel and other big- polluting industries “ As individuals , PRP have a choice about how PRP live , what PRP eat and how PRP VBP about our business ... and opportunities to live a lower - carbon life , ” VBD Andersen . Governments ’ plans to reduce NNS have n’t been universally welcomed , however , with some critics saying IN eliminating or sharply reducing fossil fuels will prove to be an JJ shock , in fuel costs for instance , WDT hurts poorer populations more than wealthier sections . What ’s more , a $ 60 - billion package of measures agreed by DT German NN recently has been criticized as a further burden on businesses , while environmentalists say PRP is too little , too late . Presenting a NN Tuesday showing average surface air temperatures in DT country have already risen by 1.5C since 1881 , German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze insisted IN Europe ’s industrial powerhouse “ is CD of DT NNS WDT is doing a lot . ” “ EX are other NNS which are quitting NN accords , ” she added , without explicitly naming DT NNP NNPS , which under NNP Donald NNP announced its withdrawal from DT Paris Agreement , citing noncompliance by NNP and others . But economists say DT widespread effects MD hit all NNS and those most vulnerable are at DT greatest risk . DT JJ economy will be at least 3 % smaller by 2050 owed solely to DT effects of unchecked NN NN , including severe weather and rising NN levels , some major investment banks have warned . In DT Paris agreement , nearly 200 NNS set their own national targets for reducing or controlling pollution of heat - trapping gases . PRP was negotiated in 2015 with lots of prodding by DT U.S. and NNP at DT NN and went into effect Nov. 4 , 2016 . DT terms of DT deal say no country can withdraw in DT first three NNS ; NNP began DT U.S. withdrawal process earlier this month . Experts agree IN DT longer NNS continue burning fossil fuels , DT more NN will be “ locked in ” as NNS stay in DT atmosphere for NNS or even decades . Conversely , DT sooner NNS take steps to wean themselves off gas , coal and oil — such as by ending NN subsidies for fossil fuels — DT more NN will be prevented in DT long term ."

Most of DT blame fell on NNS IN DT U.S. , Brazil , and Saudi Arabia , but around DT NN political systems simply are n’t responding to DT greatest crisis PRP ’ve ever faced — PRP ’re so corrupted by fossil fuel money , so overcome by inertia , so preoccupied with DT next election or coup . But , amid DT desolation , EX were a couple of signs of hope . PRP came from DT NN of high finance . Just as young NNS and indigenous leaders were being kicked out of DT UN talks for their protests , DT Liberty Mutual insurance company became CD of DT first big U.S. insurers to announce PRP MD stop aiding coal companies . DT announcement came after sustained pressure from a coalition of environmental groups called Insure Our Future , and though Liberty ’s pledges are just a beginning — oil and gas are DT bigger future threats at this point , as coal ’s decline is already underway — PRP was proof IN even vast sums of money can’t insulate companies from activism . DT point was underscored over when Goldman Sachs announced on December 14 IN PRP MD restrict its lending to DT coal industry , and further IN PRP was n’t interested in funding DT drilling of DT Arctic . Again a coalition of groups — from DT Gwich ’in tribe in Alaska ’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to DT Sierra Club and DT Rainforest Action Network — had pressed hard . And again Goldman ’s response was just a first step . But given DT imbalance in forces — a remote native band against CD of DT NN ’s biggest banks — PRP was a hopeful sign . Hopeful because these kinds of campaigns are VBG to expand and build . More and more , organizers are deciding IN , after decades of asking governments to VB , PRP ’re RB VBG to have to VB after other power centers . Washington and Wall Street are deeply linked , but PRP ’re RB distinct , and both need to shift dramatically . And hopeful for other reasons too . Even if PRP can VB politicians to make real NN , PRP will come slowly , and CD national capitol at a NN . But if these financial giants begin to move , DT effects will be both quick and JJ — and those are DT two things most required for effective progress on DT NN . This winter will likely see a prolonged campaign against big insurers , big asset managers IN Blackrock , and big banks . Chase Bank exemplifies DT problem : PRP ’re DT worst , lending hundreds of billions of dollars for DT most extreme fossil fuel projects on NN . PRP ’ve dramatically their lending since DT Paris accords ; PRP ’re DT bankroll for DT most dangerous activity on NN NN . If these bankers plugged DT money pipeline , DT fossil fuel industry MD have to stop expanding — which is precisely what NNS have told PRP is now required . PRP MD seem impossible to take banks WDT size on — PRP ’re literally a central pillar of JJ capital . But look at them another way : unlike Exxon or Shell , PRP ’re able to make plenty of money from things other than fossil fuel . Destroying DT NN is only a side business for them — heck , PRP MD make money financing DT transition to sun and wind . And PRP ’re potentially vulnerable to citizen anger . Activists , more and more , are taking up DT cry of “ Make Them Pay , ” understanding IN PRP ’s not okay to pile up profits by devastating DT NN . Chase has 5,000 branches spread across America . Indigenous activists joined by my colleagues at DT 350 Seattle chapter shut down all 44 branches in their city for a day last spring , and EX ’s no reason not to try DT same thing across DT country . Anyone with a pair of scissors can cut up a credit card . VB about DT electoral map WDT NNP always holds up to taunt his foes , DT NN with DT huge patches of red . Well , a map of DT country ’s shows IN most of PRP is in those blue patches where NNS care deeply about NN NN : if electoral power is unfairly spread , so is financial power , but this NN in a way WDT might work to put pressure on DT banks . DT political and DT financial are not completely separate tracks for activists , of course . Around DT NN , campaigners are RB VBG after central banks , DT NN - sponsored institutions WDT control much of DT NN ’s monetary policy . DT European Investment Bank announced earlier this autumn IN PRP MD no longer finance fossil fuel projects ; campaigners in Switzerland VBD December 16 IN PRP were getting closer to persuading DT Swiss Central Bank to take action ( and Swiss banks are no small thing ! ) . But DT truly big money is piled up in those American institutions WDT dominate JJ finance . DT dominance is not fair nor wise , but right now PRP gives PRP CD more lever to reach for in this moment of NN crisis ."

( AP Photo / Mark Lennihan , File ) NNP YORK ( AP ) — A changing NN means dramatic risks for DT NN — and for investments too , DT chief of DT NN ’s largest investment manager VBD Tuesday . To prepare for and protect against those risks , BlackRock CEO Laurence Fink VBD in his influential annual letter to CEOs IN his firm , which manages roughly $ 7 trillion for investors , will make a series of moves putting NN NN and sustainability at DT center of its investing approach . Among them , BlackRock will cut out investments in some coal producers from some of its portfolios , sharply increase DT number of sustainability - focused funds WDT PRP offers , and vote against companies at shareholder meetings when PRP ’re too slow in disclosing and mitigating their impact on DT environment . “ NN NN has become a defining factor in companies ’ long - term prospects , ” Fink wrote in his letter , adding IN he believes “ PRP are on DT edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance ” because of PRP . Fink predicted IN DT changes in how capital is deployed will come “ more quickly than PRP see changes to DT NN itself , ” and “ sooner than most anticipate . ” In fact , DT shift is already underway . Investors poured a net $ 20.6 billion into sustainable funds across DT industry last NN , nearly quadruple DT record set a NN earlier , according to Morningstar . Investors , particularly younger ones , increasingly say PRP VBP their money invested with an eye toward sustainability . DT total dollars are still small relative to DT entire industry — investors plugged a total of $ 413.9 billion into all taxable bond funds last NN , while yanking $ 41.3 billion out of all U.S. stock funds — but DT trend is clear and accelerating . Fearful of losing out on those dollars — and DT fees WDT PRP produce — investment companies are rushing to meet DT surging demand . BlackRock and other huge asset managers are generally behind smaller competitors when PRP comes to sustainability , VBD Danielle Fugere , NN of shareholder - advocacy group As PRP Sow . BlackRock , NNP Street , Vanguard and others have been criticized for not doing more about DT environment . Besides protests outside its Manhattan headquarters , BlackRock has RB heard criticism from members of Congress who believe PRP MD better address NN NN . Because of its size and reach , any shift in focus by BlackRock MD alter DT industry . PRP is a major shareholder in thousands of companies through its popular exchange - traded funds WDT track various indexes , as well as its funds run by stock - picking managers . But Fugere VBD Tuesday ’s announcement is only a first step . “ DT words are significant , and DT words show leadership , ” Fugere VBD . “ But DT ’s not enough . PRP have to see on DT ground action , and PRP need to see PRP quickly . EX is no NN . Australia is burning up . California is burning up . ” DT wildfires in parts of Australia and California and other recent disasters have shown big institutional investors IN NN NN is just as much a threat to their returns in DT near term as over DT coming decades . “ DT physical risks have become so immediately clear and stark , ” VBD Amy Borrus , deputy director of DT Council for Institutional Investors , whose members include pension funds , endowments and other U.S. - based asset owners investing more than $ 4 trillion . “ JJ institutional investors will welcome these steps by BlackRock , ” she VBD . “ More and more JJ funds are coming around to DT view IN sound environmental , social and governance practices are not just about making DT NN better but about fundamentally creating and preserving shareholder value . ” This approach to investing comes after a yearslong evolution for DT industry , which began with simple funds WDT bluntly excluded stocks deemed as harmful , such as gun makers or tobacco stocks . Now , fund managers say PRP PRP look at environmental , social and governance issues broadly as part of their analysis of any investment . PRP ’s known as “ ESG ” investing , and proponents say PRP aids investors ’ returns , not just their consciences , because PRP helps them avoid risky stocks and big potential losses . Companies with poor records on environmental issues are more likely to face big fines , for example . For all DT noise made by Fink ’s announcement , DT reaction in DT stock market was muted on Tuesday . NN stocks in DT S&P 500 were down , but not as much as some other corners of DT market . Coal stocks were mixed . In his letter , Fink VBD companies and investors have a role to play in DT transition to a low - carbon NN , but governments will ultimately need to lead DT way . Some movement has begun . DT European Union on Tuesday unveiled a plan to dedicate a quarter of its budget to tackling NN NN and to help shift 1 trillion euros ( $ 1.1 trillion ) in investment towards making DT economy more environmentally friendly over DT next 10 NNS . DT Europe Investment Plan will be funded by DT EU budget and DT private sector . PRP aims to deliver on European Commission NN Ursula von der Leyen ’s Green Deal to make DT bloc DT NN ’s first carbon - neutral continent by 2050 . “ PRP will be interesting to see whether Black Rock ’s high profile move will have any impact on policy , ” Borrus VBD . “ NN can do much more in DT long run on NN NN than investment flows . ” AP Reporter Samuel Petrequin contributed to this report from Brussels ."

But CD of DT most frightening studies I 've read recently had nothing to do with icebergs or mega - droughts . In a paper WDT came out Oct. 23 in NNP , John Sterman  a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's ( MIT ) Sloan School of Management  wrote about asking 212 MIT grad students to give a rough idea of how much governments need to reduce JJ greenhouse gas NNS by to eventually stop DT increase in DT concentration of carbon in DT atmosphere . These students had training in NN , technology , mathematics and economics at CD of DT best schools in DT NN  PRP are probably a lot smarter than PRP or me . Yet 84 % of Sterman 's subjects got DT question wrong , greatly underestimating DT degree to which greenhouse gas NNS need to fall . When DT MIT kids can't figure out NN NN , what are DT odds WDT DT broader NN will ? DT shocking NN reflects DT tremendous gap WDT exists regarding JJ NN . On DT CD hand are DT NNS , who with few exceptions VBP NN NN is very serious and needs to be dealt with immediately and ambitiously . On DT other side is DT NN , which increasingly believes IN NN NN is real and worries about PRP , but which rarely ranks PRP as a high priority . A 2007 survey by DT U.N. Development Programme found IN 54 % of Americans advocate taking a "" wait and see "" approach to NN - NN action  holding off on DT deep and rapid cuts in JJ NN WDT MD immediately impact their lives . ( And PRP 's not just SUV - driving Americans who take this position  similar majorities were found in Russia , NNP and India . ) As a result , PRP have our current dilemma : a steady drumbeat of scientific evidence of JJ NN 's severity and comparatively little in DT way of meaningful political action . "" This gap exists , "" says Sterman . "" DT real question is why . "" Hear Bryan Walsh and John Sterman talk about DT problems faced by NNS in communicating DT risks of NN NN . DT 's where Sterman 's research comes in . "" EX is a profound and fundamental misconception about NN , "" he says . DT problem is IN most of PRP do n't really understand how carbon accumulates in DT atmosphere . Increasing JJ temperatures are driven by DT increase in DT concentration of carbon in DT atmosphere . Before DT industrial age , DT concentration was about 280 parts per million ( p.p.m. ) of carbon in DT atmosphere . After a few centuries of burning coal , oil and other fossil fuels , PRP 've raised DT concentration to 387 p.p.m. , and PRP continues to rise by about 2 p.p.m. every NN . JJ NNS believe IN PRP need to at least stabilize carbon concentrations at 450 p.p.m. to ensure IN JJ temperatures do n't increase more than about 2 degrees Celsius above DT pre-industrial level . To do DT , PRP need to reduce JJ carbon NNS ( which hit about 10 billion tons last NN ) until PRP are equal to or less than DT amount of carbon sequestered by DT oceans and plant life ( which removed about 4.8 billion tons of carbon last NN ) . PRP 's just IN NN in a bathtub  unless more NN is draining out than flowing in from DT tap , eventually DT bathtub will overflow . DT means IN carbon NNS MD need to be cut drastically from current levels . Yet almost all of DT subjects in Sterman 's NN failed to realize IN , assuming instead IN PRP MD stabilize carbon concentration simply by capping carbon NNS at their current level . DT 's not DT case  and in fact , pursuing such a plan for DT future MD virtually guarantee IN JJ NN MD spin out of control . PRP MD seem to JJ IN good common sense to wait until PRP see proof of DT serious damage JJ NN is doing before PRP take action . But PRP 's not  PRP can't "" wait and see "" on JJ NN because DT NN has a momentum all its own , and if PRP wait for decades to finally act to reduce carbon NNS , PRP MD well be too late . Yet this simply is n't understood . Someone as smart as Bill Gates does n't seem to VB PRP . "" Fortunately NN NN , although PRP 's a huge challenge , PRP 's a challenge WDT happens over a long period of NN , "" he VBD at a forum in Beijing last NN . "" PRP VBP , PRP have NN to work on PRP . "" But DT truth is PRP do n't . If élite NNS MD simply solve NN NN on their own , JJ misunderstanding MD n't be such a problem . But PRP can't . Reducing carbon NNS sharply will require all 6.5 billion ( and growing ) of PRP on DT NN to hugely VB DT way PRP use NN and travel . PRP 'll RB need to VB DT way PRP vote , rewarding politicians willing to make DT tough choices on NN . Instead of a JJ Manhattan Project  DT metaphor often used for JJ NN  Sterman believes IN what is needed is closer to a JJ civil rights movement , a large - scale campaign WDT dramatically changes DT NN 's beliefs and behaviors . JJ groups IN Al Gore 's NNP Campaign are aiming for just such a social transformation , but "" DT reality is IN this is even more difficult than civil rights , "" says Sterman . "" Even DT took a long NN , and PRP do n't have DT kind of NN with DT NN . "" DT good NN is IN PRP do n't need a Ph.D. in climatology to understand what needs to be done . If PRP can grasp DT bathtub analogy , PRP can understand how to stop JJ NN . DT burden is on NNS to better explain in clear English DT dynamics of DT NN system , and how to affect PRP . ( Sterman says IN DT Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP 's landmark report last NN was "" completely inadequate "" on this score . ) As for DT rest of PRP , PRP should try to remember IN sometimes common sense is n't a match for NN ."

DT most comprehensive account yet published says IN almost half DT record decrease was due to fewer car journeys . But DT authors are worried IN , as NNS return to work , car use will soar again . PRP fear CO2 NNS MD soon be higher than before DT crisis . PRP are urging politicians to grasp DT moment and make real , durable changes on transport and personal mobility . • NN : Five charts about DT biggest carbon crash In DT UK , Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has pledged £ 250 m for improvements to cycling and walking infrastructure . Other NNS are RB looking at similar plans . DT lockdowns WDT most governments have implemented in response to NNP - CD have had a significant impact on DT carbon - producing activities WDT are embedded in almost everything PRP do . Road transport has declined hugely , as has aviation . However , now IN DT UK is beginning to return to work , Mr Shapps VBD NNS should drive to work rather than use JJ transport , should walking or cycling not be an option . "" If PRP can't walk or cycle but PRP do have access to a car , please use PRP rather than travelling by bus , train or tram , "" he VBD . Industry has temporarily closed down and demand for NN all over DT NN has crashed . Now in detailed analysis , researchers have shown how those changes have impacted our NNS of CO2 . PRP 've calculated DT fall off in carbon based on DT lockdown policies implemented in 69 NNS WDT between them account for 97 % of JJ NNS . During DT peak of DT crisis in early April , daily NNS dropped by 17 % compared to DT previous NN , meaning around 17 million tonnes less CO2 were emitted every day . DT key to DT fall has been cars . Surface transport NNS have declined by 43 % , DT same amount as DT drop from industry and power generation combined . • How much warmer is your city ? • What is your diet 's carbon footprint ? • Where PRP are in seven charts While DT aviation slowdown has grabbed headlines for DT JJ impact , PRP only accounts for 10 % of DT decrease during DT pandemic . NNP has been responsible for DT biggest drop , followed by DT NNP , Europe and India . If some restrictions on JJ activity stay in place worldwide until DT end of DT NN , then JJ NNS will likely drop by 7 % . If pre-pandemic levels of transport and JJ activity return by mid-June , DT annual fall MD be around 4 % . But DT research team WDT carried out this work is concerned IN DT rebound , especially on DT roads , MD see a carbon surge . Lockdown has raised questions about other pollutants , too . CD of DT UK's leading experts , Prof Frank Kelly , from King 's College London , VBD he knew diesel cars were emitting far more pollution than advertised - fully two NNS before NNP authorities exposed DT scandal . He told Radio 4's DT Life Scientific programme WDT his team discovered a huge mismatch between NNS declared by DT car firms and real readings on DT road . Prof Kelly VBD he reported PRP to DT Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) , but PRP did n't publish his findings . He VBD work undertaken subsequently in DT NNP led to legal action against car makers WDT had installed "" defeat devices "" to fool regulators . DT NN did n't deny DT account . A spokesperson VBD : "" PRP are taking urgent action to improve air quality and our Clean Air Strategy has been commended by DT NNP NNP Organization as an ' example for DT rest of DT NN to follow ' "" . Meanwhile , on DT NNP - CD crisis , he VBD levels of DT pollutant NO2 had fallen by up to 60 % in London since DT fall in traffic under lockdown . Levels of another pollutant , sooty particles , remained at harmful concentrations . "" A big worry IN NNS will naturally VB to VB back to their cars to VB to work , and DT MD rebound DT NNS to DT same level or even higher than before , once everybody goes back , "" VBD Prof Corinne Le Quéré from DT University of East Anglia , who led DT analysis . DT researchers say IN fundamental , systemic NN is needed if DT NNS curve is to be flattened in a way WDT MD limit DT very worst impacts of NN NN . When PRP comes to transportation , EX are huge opportunities , according to Prof Le Quéré . She says IN after DT JJ financial crisis in 2008 , some governments IN NNP , NNP and Germany made significant investments in wind and solar NN and this drove down DT prices of these renewables . "" Here now in 2020 PRP 're very close to DT same situation in electric mobility , "" she told BBC NNP . "" Battery prices have come down , PRP have lots of models and governments are VBG to try to boost their economies . "" "" So if these two things can align , then PRP MD make a huge difference to DT transportation of tomorrow .

A four - degree - warmer NN is DT stuff of nightmares and yet DT ’s where PRP ’re heading in just decades . While governments mull various carbon targets aimed at keeping human - induced JJ heating within safe levels – including JJ ambitions to reach net - zero NNS by 2050 – PRP ’s worth looking ahead pragmatically at what happens if PRP fail . After all , JJ NNS VBP PRP ’s highly unlikely IN PRP will stay below 2C ( above pre-industrial levels ) by DT end of DT century , let alone 1.5C . Most NNS are not making anywhere near enough progress to meet these internationally agreed targets . NN models predict PRP ’re currently on track for a heating of somewhere between 3C and 4C for 2100 , although bear in mind IN these are JJ average temperatures – at DT poles and over land ( where NNS live ) , DT increase MD be double DT . Predictions are tricky , however , as temperatures depend on how sensitive DT NN is to carbon dioxide ( CO ) . Most models assume IN PRP is not very sensitive – DT ’s where DT lower 3C comes from – but a whole JJ set of models to be published in 2021 finds much greater sensitivity . PRP put heating at around 5C by DT end of DT century , meaning NNS MD be experiencing as much as 10C of heating over land . Such uncertainty is n’t ideal , but for our purposes let ’s plump for an entirely feasible planetary heating of 4C by DT end of DT century . If DT seems a long NN away , consider IN plenty of NNS PRP VBP will be around then . My NNS will be in their 80s , perhaps with middle - aged NNS and grandchildren . PRP are making their NN and PRP will be a very different place . Four degrees MD not sound IN much – after all , PRP is less than a typical temperature NN between night and day . PRP might even sound pleasant , IN retiring from DT UK to southern Spain . However , an average heating of DT entire globe by 4C MD render DT NN unrecognisable from anything humans have ever experienced . DT last NN DT NN was this hot was 15 m NNS ago during DT miocene , when intense volcanic eruptions in western North America emitted vast quantities of CO . NN levels rose some 40 metres higher than today and lush forests grew in Antarctica and DT Arctic . However , IN JJ heating took place over JJ thousands of NNS . Even at its most rapid , DT rise in CO NNS occurred at a rate 1,000 times slower than ours has since DT start of DT Industrial Revolution . DT gave animals and plants NN to adapt to JJ conditions and , crucially , ecosystems had not been degraded by humans . Things look considerably bleaker for our 2100 NN . Over DT past decade , NNS have been able to produce a far more nuanced picture of how temperature rise affects DT complexities of cloud cover and atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns and ecology . PRP ’re looking at vast dead zones in DT oceans as nutrients from fertiliser runoff combine with warmer waters to produce an explosion in algae WDT starve marine life of oxygen . This will be exacerbated by DT acidity from dissolved CO , which will cause a mass die - off , particularly of shellfish , plankton and coral . “ PRP will have lost all DT reefs decades before 2100 – at somewhere between 2C and 4C , ” says Johan Rockström , director of DT Potsdam Institute for NNP Impact Research in Germany . NN levels will be perhaps two metres higher and , more worryingly , PRP will be well on our way to an NN - free NN , having passed DT tipping points for DT Greenland and west Antarctic NN sheets , committing PRP to at least 10 metres of NN - level rise in coming centuries . DT ’s because as NN sheets melt , their surface drops to a lower altitude where PRP is warmer , speeding up melting in a runaway feedback loop . Eventually , dark , heat - absorbing land is exposed , speeding DT melting process even more . By 2100 , PRP will RB have lost most low - latitude glaciers , including two - thirds of DT so called third pole of DT Hindu Kush - Karakoram - Himalayan mountains and Tibetan plateau WDT feeds JJ of Asia ’s important rivers . However , most rivers , especially in Asia , will flood more often , according to research by Richard Betts , head of NN impacts at DT Met Office Hadley Centre , because DT hotter atmosphere will produce more intense monsoons , violent storms and extreme rainfall . His studies predict a wide equatorial belt of high humidity WDT will cause intolerable heat stress across most of tropical Asia , Africa , Australia and DT Americas , rendering them uninhabitable for much of DT NN . Tropical forests of heat - tolerant species MD well thrive in this wet zone with DT high CO concentrations , especially with DT disappearance of human infrastructure and agriculture , although DT conditions will probably favour lianas ( vines ) over slower - growing trees , Betts says . To DT south and north of this humid zone , bands of expansive desert will RB rule out agriculture and human habitation . Some models predict IN desert conditions will stretch from DT Sahara right up through south and central Europe , drying rivers including DT Danube and DT Rhine . In South America , DT picture is more complicated : increased precipitation MD enhance DT Amazon rainforest , leading to mightier river flow . Other models predict a weakening of DT easterlies over DT Atlantic , drying DT Amazon , increasing fires and turning PRP from forest to grassland . DT tipping point for DT Amazon MD well be triggered by deforestation ; while DT intact forest MD cope with some drought because PRP generates and maintains its own moist ecosystem , areas WDT have been opened up through degradation allow moisture to escape . “ A combination of NN NN and deforestation MD push PRP into a savannah NN , ” Rockström says . All of nature will be affected by DT NN in NN , ecosystems and hydrology and EX will be plenty of extinctions as species struggle to migrate and adapt to an utterly changed NN . Daniel Rothman , co-director of MIT ’s Lorenz Center , calculates IN 2100 will herald DT beginning of NNP ’s sixth mass extinction event . But what about PRP ? This is undoubtedly a more hostile , dangerous NN for humanity , which by 2100 will number around 11 billion , all of whom will need food , NN , power and somewhere to live . PRP will be , in a giant understatement , problematic . DT good NN is IN humans wo n’t become extinct – DT species can survive with just a few hundred individuals ; DT bad NN is , PRP risk great loss of life and perhaps DT end of our civilisations . JJ of DT places where NNS live and grow food will no longer be suitable for either . Higher NN levels will make today ’s low - lying islands and JJ coastal regions , where nearly half DT JJ population live , uninhabitable , generating an estimated 2 billion refugees by 2100 . Bangladesh alone will lose CD - third of its land area , including its main breadbasket . From 2030 , more than half DT population will live in DT tropics , an area WDT makes up a third of DT NN and already struggles with NN impacts . Yet by 2100 , most of DT low and mid latitudes will be uninhabitable because of heat stress or drought ; despite stronger precipitation , DT hotter soils will lead to faster evaporation and most populations will struggle for fresh NN . PRP will have to live on a smaller land surface with a larger population . Indeed , DT consequences of a 4C warmer NN are so terrifying IN most NNS MD rather not contemplate them , let alone work out a survival strategy . Rockström does n’t VB our chances . “ PRP ’s difficult to see how PRP MD accommodate eight billion NNS or maybe even half of DT , ” he says . “ EX will be a rich minority of NNS who survive with modern lifestyles , no doubt , but PRP will be a turbulent , conflict - ridden NN . ” He points out IN PRP already use nearly half DT NN ’s NN - free surface to produce food for 7 billion NNS and thinks meeting DT needs of 11 billion in such hostile conditions MD be impossible . “ DT reason is primarily making enough food , but RB PRP MD have lost DT biodiversity PRP ’re dependent on and be facing a cocktail of negative shocks all DT NN , from fires to droughts . ” Others are more sanguine . “ I do n’t VB IN humans as a species or even industrial civilisation is seriously threatened , ” says Ken Caldeira , climatologist at DT Carnegie Institution for NNP in California . “ NNS live in Houston , Miami and Atlanta because PRP live in air conditioning through DT hot summers . If NNS are rich enough to air - condition their lives , PRP can watch whatever is DT successor to Game of Thrones on TV , as DT natural NN decays around them , ” he says . But he points out IN while richer NNS risk a loss to their quality of life , DT poorer risk their actual lives . So how might PRP give all of humanity DT best chance ? Our best hope lies in cooperating as never before to radically reorganise our NN : decoupling DT political map from geography . However unrealistic PRP sounds , PRP ’d need to look at DT NN afresh and see PRP in terms of where DT resources are and then plan DT population , food and NN production around DT . PRP MD mean abandoning huge tracts of DT globe and moving NNP ’s human population to DT high latitudes : Canada , Siberia , Scandinavia , parts of Greenland , Patagonia , Tasmania , NNP Zealand and perhaps newly NN - free parts of DT western Antarctic coast . If PRP allow 20 sq m of space per person – more than double DT minimum habitable space allowed per person under English planning regulations – 11 billion NNS MD need 220,000 sq km of land to live on . DT area of Canada alone is 9.9 m sq km and , combined with all DT other high - latitude areas , such as Alaska , Britain , Russia and Scandinavia , EX should be plenty of room for everyone . These precious lands , with tolerable temperatures and access to NN , MD RB be valuable food - growing areas , as well as DT last oases for JJ species , so NNS MD need to be housed in compact , efficient high - rise cities with reflective roofs and resource - recycling systems . DT risks raising local temperatures to intolerable levels , because compact cities function as heat islands , so solar - powered cooling or even artificial winds MD be needed to counteract this . EX is RB an increased risk of epidemics in such densely populated spaces . Peter Cox , a climatologist at DT University of Exeter , thinks this is viable , but MD require a massive programme of infrastructure to manage waste , air quality and NN needs . City - scale underground reservoirs MD supply domestic needs and efficient recycling MD keep NN – and other resources – circulating in DT population for NNS rather than hours . Post - fossil fuels , PRP will require unprecedented electricity production . This MD come from vast arrays of solar - and wind - power plants in a belt across DT uninhabitable desert regions . High - voltage direct current transmission lines MD relay this power to DT cities or PRP MD be stored as thermal NN in molten salts and transported in hydrogen – after solar NN is used to split NN to provide hydrogen for fuel cells . Hydrogen production will be on an industrial scale and PRP MD be used for nonelectric transport , for instance . Wave farms , nuclear fission ( and potentially fusion ) and solar power will help meet our electricity needs . In DT meantime , DT effective capture from DT air of today ’s carbon NNS will with luck be a reality ; PRP can be stored or used in DT manufacture of materials . Food production will need to be more intensive , efficient and industrial . This will be a mostly vegetarian NN , largely devoid of fish and without DT grazing area or resources for livestock . Poultry MD be viable on DT edges of farmland and synthetic meats and other foods will meet some of DT demand . Heat - tolerant , drought - resistant crop varieties , such as cassava and millet , will replace JJ of our current unmodified staples such as rice and wheat and PRP will grow faster and with greater NN efficiency because of DT high CO levels . CD problem is IN almost all of our agriculture will need to be at higher latitudes , because DT tropics will be too dry or too hot for farmworkers . And DT means less land and less sunlight in winter . “ JJ agriculture MD be limited by DT geometry of NNP ’s orbit around DT sun , ” Cox says . “ However , studies have shown IN crops thrive with artificial light delivered by LEDs at exactly DT right frequencies for photosynthesis . This means PRP MD grow crops through DT winter months , hydroponically in smaller spaces , stacked up in warehouses or even underground , leaving valuable land surfaces for other uses . ” Cultivation of algal mats and crops grown on floating platforms and in marshland MD RB contribute , while crops MD potentially be grown in uninhabitable regions , farmed and processed remotely by artificial farmers . Either way , PRP MD need to use far more precise nutrient and irrigation systems to avoid polluting more fertile ecosystems and reduce food loss and waste . A 4C warmer NN MD well be survivable , but PRP MD be eminently poorer than DT NN PRP currently enjoy . Rockström believes PRP takes PRP beyond our adaptation capabilities . Delivering our NNS to such a deadly home is a horrifying proposition . Given what ’s at stake , PRP MD be worth deploying geoengineering tools , which reflect DT sun ’s heat away from NNP , and so keep JJ heating to safe levels . This MD n’t address DT problem of dissolved carbon killing oceanic life , but PRP MD buy PRP more NN to decarbonise and achieve negative NNS . Crucially , keeping NNP cooler for longer MD help DT poorest NNS to adapt . “ PRP have come to a point where different forms of geoengineering cannot be excluded , ” admits Rockström , “ but SRM [ solar radiation management ] is a very dangerous geopolitical tool to deploy : who decides which part of DT globe to shade ? How MD PRP govern PRP ? ” he asks . PRP ’ve already warmed DT NN by 1.1C , and PRP ’re experiencing DT effects : DT International Federation of DT Red Cross estimates EX are as JJ as 50 million NN refugees . Once PRP reach 4C , most models agree PRP will be impossible to return to today ’s abundant NN . “ For me , DT issue is IN PRP are transforming ( and simplifying ! ) our NN for JJ thousands of NNS into DT future with millennia of rising NN [ levels ] , acidified oceans and intolerable tropical temperatures , just because PRP were n’t willing to pay DT small differential between fossil - fuelled prosperity and prosperity fuelled by non-greenhouse - gas - emitting NN systems , ” says Caldeira . PRP are now making DT NN of 2100 and however hard PRP seems to meet our NNS targets , PRP ’ll be far harder for our NNS if PRP do n’t . With international cooperation and regulation , PRP can make PRP livable . • This article was amended on 28 November 2019 .

EX were 70 tropical cyclones or hurricanes in DT Northern Hemisphere in 2018 , compared with DT long - term average of 53 . Powerful and often record - breaking storms brought devastation to DT Mariana Islands , Philippines , Vietnam , Korea , and Tonga . In DT U.S. , hurricanes Florence and Michael caused huge JJ damage and considerable loss of life , DT WMO noted in its annual NN statement . Heat waves resulted in an astounding loss in productivity in 2018 , because PRP was often either too hot to work or even VB outside safely . An incredible 153 billion hours of labour were wiped out last NN due to heat waves , nearly three times more than 2000 , according to DT 2018 report of DT Lancet Countdown on NN and NN NN released November 28 . DT most recent El Niño event ended in 2016 , and PRP was associated with catastrophic coral bleaching on DT Great Barrier Reef , severe droughts in Africa , South America and parts of DT Pacific and southeast Asia , and wildfires in Indonesia and Canada . While DT current El Niño is not expected to be as severe , PRP MD still bring dangerous weather to vulnerable areas around DT NN , NNS warn . El Niño and its opposite , La Niña , form a natural cycle WDT can last from a few months to two or three NNS . When PRP occur , weather patterns around DT NN can be affected , producing a range of impacts on crop yields , famine , heating , and cooling demands of homes and buildings , fire risks , coral bleaching , and extreme weather . Researchers say DT impacts of El Niño / La Niña events have become more severe over DT past 20 NNS due to a warmer NN . This is akin to an athlete on steroids who takes stimulants during DT Olympic final . DT combination of human - caused NN and a natural upswing in temperatures increases DT odds IN any JJ El Niño NN will be DT warmest ever , VBD NN scientist Michael Mann from Pennsylvania NNP University . Mann co-authored a 2018 NN linking NN NN to DT recent run of record - breaking droughts , heat waves , wildfires , and flooding events in DT northern hemisphere . These destructive weather extremes will increase 50 percent on average and MD increase as much as 300 percent due to NN NN alone unless DT NN acts quickly to cut carbon NNS from burning fossil fuels , DT NN concluded . Normally , El Niño events bring heavy rains to California , and if DT happens this winter PRP MD lead to flash flooding and mud slides after wildfires burned 1.6 million acres this autumn , VBD Stevenson . Nearly 14,000 homes were destroyed in those fires and now DT first storms of DT season have already produced flooding and mud slides . While El Niño brings rain and cooler weather to DT southern U.S. , PRP brings heat and drought to Australia , as well as dry winter conditions in southeastern Africa and northern Brazil . Catastrophic wildfires have already broken out in eastern Australia , along with a heat wave with temperatures over 44 degrees C ( 111 degrees F ) at DT end of November . As JJ NN continues future El Niño events will likely result in even cooler and wetter conditions in DT U.S. , enhancing flood risks . Meanwhile , La Niña events will increase wildfire danger and drought in DT southwestern NNP NNPS , Stevenson VBD . While DT impacts of El Niño / La Niña events are amplified in a warmer NN , PRP ’s not known whether NN NN will affect DT occurrence or strength of these events in DT future , she VBD . La Niña and El Niño are , respectively , DT cold and warm phases of DT El Niño - Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) cycle , which regulates heat in DT eastern tropical Pacific Ocean . In conditions defined by climatologists as "" neutral , "" high air pressure predominates in DT eastern Pacific , while low pressure predominates in DT west . DT difference in pressure generates DT trade winds , which blow east to west over DT surface of DT tropical Pacific , pushing DT warm waters westward . DT deeper , cooler waters then surface in DT east , replacing DT warm waters ."

Members : DT NN task force is a task force of DT whole council , which includes members from business , NN , environmental and civic organizations . NN NN Task Force Member List History : DT task force decided to focus on four areas of policy development : • NN NN Principles . These principles provide DT Council with a shared statement on NN NN and guide DT Council 's more in - depth discussions of NN NN policies and approaches . View Principles . • Technology Working Group . This group examined DT various types of technologies WDT are currently available , under development , or anticipated WDT MD help reduce greenhouse gas NNS , as well as examined various policies or incentives WDT MD foster DT development and dissemination of these technologies in this country and abroad . Working Group Tri-chairs : General Motors , NNP Resources Institute and DT U.S. Department of NNP • Working Group on JJ , Regulatory , and Voluntary Measures . This group examined a broad range of JJ instruments , regulatory approaches , and voluntary steps WDT MD be taken to reduce NNS of greenhouse gases . These MD include tradeable permits ; tax credits / deductions for investing in improved technologies ; carbon taxes ; mitigation measures for JJ or regional dislocations ; partnerships among DT investment and insurance communities , NN , and industry ; various regulatory approaches ; and voluntary initiatives . • Working Group on Cross- cutting Policies . Policies were identified to reduce NNS of greenhouse gases while RB furthering progress in other areas of sustainable development . This working group provided a focus for drawing linkages between DT NNP NNP Task Force and DT Council 's other task forces ( Environmental Management , Metropolitan / Rural Strategies for Sustainable Communities , and International ) and for identifying those policies WDT MD have benefits in more than CD area . Other areas of activity include : • Demonstrating DT Implementation of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Policies and Activities • JJ outreach activities including community forums , DT creation of a website , providing information to DT NN , and giving speeches and presentations on NN NN policies and activities . • Working with DT Council 's Evaluating Progress Working Group to identify indicators and measures for tracking progress in addressing DT issue of NN NN . Progress Report : DT NNP task force sent a letter to DT NNP in November 1997 ( Press Release 11/26/97 ) outlining its first product : a set of NN principles which were agreed upon to help DT task force in its policy deliberations . In DT letter , DT co-chairs of DT Council stated : "" This consensus statement about NN policy from industry , environmental , citizen and NN and local leaders is , as far as PRP are aware , DT first such agreement on NN policy . "" DT principles call for incentives for early action , international commitments , accountability , flexibility , strong measures to encourage technology , and fairness . Working group meetings began in February 1998 . • 1 . DT Working groups developed a set of recommendations to accelerate DT development and deployment of NN - friendly technology , principles for early action to reduce greenhouse gas NNS , and identified steps WDT MD be taken to foster broad - based community participation to realize DT benefits of NN protection . 2 . DT NNP Task Force transmitted DT Early Action Principles to DT NNP ( Transmittal Letter to DT NNP ) in October 1998 .

A federal appeals court on Friday , Jan. 17 , 2020 , dismissed a lawsuit by 21 young NNS who claimed DT U.S. NN 's NN policy harms them and jeopardizes their future . ( Chris Pietsch / DT Register - Guard via AP , File ) PORTLAND , Ore. ( AP ) — A federal appeals court on Friday dismissed a lawsuit by 21 young NNS who claimed DT U.S. NN ’s NN policies and reliance on fossil fuels harms them , jeopardizes their future and violates their constitutional rights , potentially dealing a fatal blow to a long - running case WDT activists saw as an important front in DT war against environmental degradation . DT Oregon - based youth advocacy group Our NNPS ’s Trust filed DT lawsuit in 2015 in Eugene on behalf of DT youngsters . PRP sought an injunction ordering DT NN to implement a plan to phase out fossil fuel NNS and draw down atmospheric carbon dioxide emission . DT case had bounced around DT federal courts for five NNS and multiple trial dates were canceled . DT 2 - 1 vote for dismissal by DT 9th Circuit Court of Appeals was a serious setback for DT NN activists , who vowed to ask DT full 9th Circuit panel to review DT ruling . Our NNS ’s Trust has filed numerous similar NNS in NN and federal courts and currently has nine NNS pending in NN courts from Alaska to NNP Mexico . DT federal ruling was less likely to impact those NNS , experts VBD . “ This is a very serious blow to DT case , perhaps a fatal blow , ” VBD Jennifer Rushlow , an associate dean for environmental programs at Vermont Law School , who has been watching DT case closely . Our NNS ’s Trust VBD in a statement IN although DT justices ruled for dismissal , PRP was important to note IN PRP RB VBD in DT opinion IN DT evidence showed NN NN was real and caused by fossil fuels and IN DT young plaintiffs had suffered legitimate consequences from NN NN . DT “ case is far from over , ” VBD Julia Olson , lead attorney for Our NNPS ’s Trust . “ DT court recognized IN NN NN is exponentially increasing and IN DT federal NN has long known IN its actions substantially contribute to DT NN crisis . ” NN attorneys repeatedly sought DT case ’s dismissal and succeeded in having DT scope of DT claims narrowed and some defendants dismissed during NNS of back - and - forth litigation . On Friday , DT court wrote IN DT youngsters made a compelling case IN action is needed and agreed IN NN NN is undeniable , but VBD DT proper venue for addressing DT nation ’s NNS policies and fossil fuel use is DT U.S. Congress or DT executive branch . In addition , DT justices wrote IN ending DT use of fossil fuels in DT U.S. alone — which is what DT plaintiffs sought — MD not be enough to slow or stop NN NN . “ DT ’s DT heartbreaking thing about this opinion . DT 9th Circuit recognizes IN NN NN is an existential threat … and agrees IN DT political branches have not done enough to address this problem in DT past and are unlikely to do so in DT future . But DT court just feels PRP ’s in a really difficult situation , ” VBD Cara Horowitz , co-director of DT Emmett Institute on NNP NNP and DT Environment at DT University of California , Los Angeles School of Law . DT youths , who were between DT ages of 8 and 18 when DT lawsuit was filed in 2015 , tied specific incidents WDT had affected their lives to NN NN and U.S. NN policies . In CD instance , a young woman VBD she was forced to leave her home on a Navajo reservation because of NN scarcity , separating her from her relatives . Another — DT youngest plaintiff — VBD storms driven by NN NN have hurt his home , a barrier island off DT Florida coast WDT ’s just 13 feet ( 3.96 meters ) above NN level . Still others cite NN impacts , such as worsening asthma attacks from air pollution . DT plaintiffs come from all over DT U.S. , from Oregon to Louisiana to NNP York . DT sole dissenting justice , Josephine Staton , wrote IN “ my colleagues throw up their hands . ” “ No case can singlehandedly prevent DT catastrophic effects of NN NN predicted by DT NN and NNS . ... and DT mere fact IN this suit cannot alone halt NN NN does not mean IN PRP presents no claim suitable for judicial resolution , ” Staton wrote in her dissent . This story has been corrected to show DT dissenting judge ’s last name is Staton , not Stanton ."

Over DT next century , NN NN will make DT oceans warmer and more acidic . Melting NN sheets will drive up NN levels at an accelerating pace . Marine heat waves will become 20 to 50 times more frequent , harming sensitive ecosystems . And DT total biomass of animals in DT NN MD drop by as much as 15 % , according to DT sobering assessment by DT U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP . “ DT oceans and NN are in trouble , so PRP ’re all in trouble , ” VBD Michael Oppenheimer , a NN scientist at Princeton and a lead author of DT report . But while some damage is inevitable at this point , DT report makes clear IN society ’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas NNS in DT coming decades will determine how bad things ultimately VBP . PRP ’s “ DT difference between an unmanageable problem and CD WDT humans can deal with , ” Oppenheimer VBD . DT analysis , released Wednesday at a meeting of NNS and policymakers in Monaco , follows close on DT heels of DT U.N. NNP Action Summit in NNP York , which failed to elicit ambitious commitments from DT NN ’s biggest polluters . Yet DT report underscores just how costly delaying action will be . Thus far , DT NN ’s oceans have been DT quiet hero of our VBG NN . PRP have absorbed about a quarter of DT carbon dioxide humans have pumped into DT atmosphere since DT dawn of DT industrial revolution , and 90 % of DT resulting heat . “ But PRP ca n’t keep up , ” VBD Ko Barrett , DT deputy administrator for research at DT National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a vice chair of DT Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP , or IPCC . DT report illustrates how NN NN has already started to alter DT chemistry and circulation of DT oceans , and how WDT exacts a heavy toll on marine ecosystems . Coastal communities , which will be home to a billion NNS by 2050 , are RB feeling DT impacts , starting with rising seas . Over DT last century , NN level rise was primarily driven by runoff from melting mountain glaciers in places IN Alaska and DT Andes , as well as by DT expansion of seawater as PRP warmed . Now , however , DT massive NN sheets in Greenland and Antarctica have taken over as DT largest contributors , and PRP are increasing NN levels faster than ever . Since 2006 , NN levels have risen at a rate of 0.14 of an inch per NN — more than double DT rate over DT previous century . DT big question is what will happen next . Based on JJ research since DT last IPCC assessment came out in 2014 , DT authors increased their estimates of projected future NN levels . Compared with DT turn of DT 21st century , NN levels will increase about 1.5 feet by 2100 and will rise a total of 3 feet by DT NN 2300 — if society rapidly reduces greenhouse gases . DT will present plenty of challenges , “ but things will evolve slowly , giving humans plenty of NN to plan , ” Oppenheimer VBD . On DT other hand , if NNS fail to curb NNS in DT next few decades , DT NN will see about 3 feet of NN level rise by DT end of DT century — and much more after DT . In DT worst - case scenario , in which parts of DT Antarctic NN sheet start to collapse , PRP MD be in for as much as 17 feet of NN level rise by 2300 . DT MD probably outpace society ’s ability to adapt , Oppenheimer VBD . No NN knows exactly where DT tipping point lies , but NNS have already seen troubling signs of rapid NN loss in places IN Antarctica ’s Thwaites Glacier , which alone contains enough NN to raise NN levels by 2 feet . “ DT is very worrying , ” VBD Regine Hock , a glaciologist at DT University of Alaska Fairbanks and an author of DT report . “ DT indications are RB IN instability might be on its way . ” ( Hock RB coordinated a chapter on high - mountain areas , which looked at DT impacts of shrinking glaciers and snowpacks on ecosystems and communities . ) Regardless of how much NN levels rise over DT long term , PRP will cause problems for coastal communities in DT short term because of increasingly devastating storm surges and high tides . By 2050 , flood events WDT used to occur only once a century will happen at least once every NN in JJ places in DT NN , even under a best - case scenario , according to DT report . In fact , CD NN found IN so - called 100 - NN floods will occur in Los Angeles about five times per NN by mid-century . On top of DT , hurricanes will intensify , and extreme El Niño and La Niña events — which have profound impacts on California ’s weather — are forecast to happen twice as often by DT end of DT century . DT ’s true no matter how quickly NNS reduce greenhouse gas NNS . JJ of these episodes will be unlike anything in living memory , and will require communities to plan for unprecedented impacts . “ If PRP do business as usual , PRP wo n’t be prepared for them , ” VBD So - Min Cheong , a human geographer at DT University of Kansas and an author of DT report . DT assessment RB looked at how NN NN is affecting fish populations and DT communities WDT depend on them . NN waters have put JJ marine animals on DT move , and range shifts are expected to become more pronounced in DT future . CD analysis found IN some fish species along DT West Coast MD migrate as much as 600 miles north under a high - NNS scenario . ( Creatures WDT can’t relocate , IN corals , MD simply be eradicated . ) Some animals will thrive in their JJ homes and others will hit dead ends , forcing fishing industries to adapt . But on DT whole , unmitigated NN NN will decrease DT potential catch of JJ fisheries by 20 % , DT report concluded . Tropical NNS will be hit DT hardest , in part because JJ communities depend heavily on DT ocean for their livelihood , VBD Katie Matthews , chief scientist at DT nonprofit organization Oceana , who was not involved in DT report . As with NN level rise , however , DT extent of DT damage depends on how quickly society acts to reduce NNS , she VBD . A recent NN found IN meeting DT goals of DT Paris NN accord — which are to limit JJ NN to less than 2 degrees Celsius — MD protect 3 million tons of DT most lucrative fish catches . These gains MD benefit developing NNS DT most . DT report authors called on governments to protect ecosystems and NNS from these impacts . PRP emphasized DT need to slash greenhouse gas NNS , and to reduce other stresses on marine animals to give them breathing room to adapt to NN NN . EX is no NN - size - fits - all approach to making coastal communities more resilient , Cheong VBD , but governments MD help by improving early warning systems for disasters , encouraging residents to plan for NN NN when PRP rebuild , or , in some NNS , consider retreating altogether . DT report highlighted DT need to start adapting now for an uncertain future . “ PRP owe PRP to our NNS and future generations to plan for resilient communities while PRP can , ” VBD Jack Ainsworth , executive director of DT California Coastal Commission . “ History will judge PRP harshly if PRP do nothing or take halfhearted steps . ” In Oppenheimer ’s view , DT U.S. is particularly far behind . DT National Flood Insurance Program gives NNS an incentive to remain where PRP will be vulnerable to future storms , and DT NN ’s reactive approach means IN EX is often no money for adaptation until after a disaster has struck . “ These communities along DT coast are basically sitting ducks , ” he VBD . But EX are RB reasons to be hopeful . DT ocean holds DT potential to accomplish roughly a quarter of DT greenhouse gas reductions needed to meet DT Paris NN targets , according to a report released Monday by DT High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy , a group of NNS and NN leaders convened by DT NNP Resources Institute . For instance , seagrass meadows , salt marshes and mangrove habitats can sequester huge amounts of what NNS call “ blue carbon . ” Preserving and restoring them yields other benefits too , IN buffering coastlines from storms and serving as nurseries for economically important fish . Oceans can RB help by providing NN - friendly foods . As DT IPCC ’s last major report on land use pointed out , eating beef and other land - based meats is a significant driver of NN NN . But fish is a green alternative . JJ fisheries are already overexploited . But researchers say IN smart management MD boost yields and be sustainable . “ PRP can VB more out of DT ocean if PRP just pay attention and manage PRP properly , ” Matthews VBD . Even so , EX ’s no escaping DT grim picture painted by DT IPCC report . If NN NN continues unabated , “ DT consequences for humanity are sweeping and severe , ” Barrett VBD . “ What ’s at stake is DT NN of ecosystems , wildlife and — importantly — DT NN PRP leave our NNS . ”"

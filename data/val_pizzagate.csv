903,"Those watching President Trump’s rally in Tampa on Tuesday couldn’t help but be exposed to a fringe movement that discusses several loosely connected and vaguely defined — and baseless — conspiracy theories.

In one shot on Fox News, the president was partially obscured by a sign in the crowd reading “We Are Q.” In another shot during the president’s speech, a sign promoting the debunked Seth Rich conspiracy theory, with the hashtag #Qanon, came into focus in the center of the screen. Some attendees wore T-shirts with a blocky Q. Others held up signs with the letter.

They were all self-described “followers of Q,” an anonymous person or group of people who claim to be privy to government secrets. That supposedly classified information has been revealed on the 4chan and 8chan message boards and spread around mainstream internet platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Q has attracted people — the exact number is hard to know — eager to consume his “bread crumbs,” or new details in a sprawling web of conspiracy theories.

What is going on?

Just give me the basics so I can minimally understand what’s going on

Here is the short version: Q claims to be a government insider exposing an entrenched, international bureaucracy that is secretly plotting all sorts of nefarious schemes against the Trump administration and its supporters. The character uses lingo that implies that he or she has a military or intelligence background.",mainstream,M0752f,pizzagate
921,"After years of deflection and foot-dragging, the major tech companies are finally having to take steps toward policing their own content.

They have reached this point kicking and screaming, under great public pressure, after clinging for years to the fiction that they are just public utilities and that people can use their pipes for pretty much anything.

But now they have united, for a brief moment at least, against a major conspiracy theorist.

Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify have all taken action against Alex Jones.

They are deathly afraid of being accused of political bias, sometimes for good reason. Both Facebook and Twitter have both grappled with incidents of discrimination against conservatives, which may have made them gun-shy about banning (as opposed to shadow-banning) some folks.

But almost in unison, the tech giants teamed up against Jones, who runs Infowars.

Candidate Donald Trump appeared on Jones' online show in 2015, and yesterday Jones tweeted a video defense with the headline: ""EMERGENCY: President Trump Must Defend the First Amendment.""

Facebook said it has taken down some Jones pages ""for glorifying violence, which violates our graphic violence policy, and using dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants, which violates our hate speech policies.""

Apple said it removed the ""Alex Jones Show"" and other podcasts from iTunes and its podcast app. The company said it ""does not tolerate hate speech, and we have clear guidelines that creators and developers must follow to ensure we provide a safe environment for all of our users.""

Google’s YouTube dropped the ax on Jones' channel, telling The Washington Post that it terminates users who violate ""our policies against hate speech and harassment or our terms prohibiting circumvention of our enforcement measures.""

And Spotify banned Jones altogether after earlier removing some podcasts, telling the Post: ""We take reports of hate content seriously and review any podcast episode or song that is flagged by our community.""

I know Jones has a lot of fans—remember the controversy swirling around his interview with Megyn Kelly—but he's also a guy being sued by Sandy Hook parents for saying that the horrible massacre at that Connecticut school was a hoax.

Jones apologized last year, in careful language, for spreading the phony Pizzagate conspiracy theory, saying he'd been given inaccurate information.

That’s not ""conservative."" That's at odds with reality.

Jones texted the Post that being banned by the tech companies was ""a counter-strike against the global awakening.""

""We've seen a giant yellow journalism campaign with thousands and thousands of articles for weeks, for months misrepresenting what I've said and done to set the precedent to de-platform me before Big Tech and the Democratic Party as well as some Republican establishment types move against the First Amendment in this country as we know it,"" he said.

Separately, Jones called The New York Times a ""globalist intelligence agency"" and said that the ""evil, wicked sociopaths"" who work for major media outlets were teaming up to take down Infowars.

I confess I'd like to know how the four tech companies happened to take action on the same day. Perhaps they concluded there was safety in numbers. They seemed to have an ally in Drudge, whose banner headline was ""APPLE REGULATES HATE.""

But this is just a skirmish. Just recently, Mark Zuckerberg got himself into trouble by saying he saw no reason to ban pages by Holocaust deniers.

There is a fine line between banning hate and bullying on one hand and censoring controversial political opinions on the other. These battles will play out in a hyperpartisan political atmosphere. But for now, Apple, Facebook, Google and Spotify have all agreed there is one person who falls on the wrong side of that line.",mainstream,M15f1b,pizzagate

ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: If you only knew what comes on right before the camera comes up. Hello, everyone. I'm Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juab Williams, Melissa Francis and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5:00 in New York City and this is ""The Five.""

Well, we have some breaking news on the Trump transition. Rudy Giuliani is out of consideration for an administration position. We're going to hear from the former mayor in a few minutes. But first, this news comes on a very busy day for president-elect Trump.

Mr. Trump starting off his morning with a face to face meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan at Trump Tower followed by a Get-Out-the-Vote event in Baton Rouge, and now Mr. Trump is headed to Grand Rapids, Michigan, for the next step on his thank you tour kicking off in about a couple hours from now. One common theme in the president-elect speeches, his plan to bring jobs back to America. He doubled down on his promise during a speech in Louisiana this afternoon. Take a listen.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT: It's time to get help for the American people. We're going to get them into the labor market and they're going to do a great job and they're going to make good money. We're going to rebuild our country with American hands by American workers.

My administration will follow two simple rules. Buy American and hire American. OK? We have so many companies right now -- I think probably if I would have said a couple of months ago we have so many companies negotiating to leave, I don't think they're negotiating so fast right now.

BOLLING: All right KG, He promised to make America great again by bringing jobs back to America and keeping American jobs in America. Seems to be keeping his promise.

KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yes, I love it, and also a perfect location and venue to make this kind of speech to connect with the people, the forgotten men and women, the working class people that wanted someone to hear them and put them back to work and put money in their pockets and food on their table.

American cars made by American hands on the streets across this country. I think it's fantastic. This is why people joined his movement and carried him into the White House to try to get this done. And perfect timing as well, of course, with the lawsuits now being dropped for the recount here as well so, it's fantastic.

BOLLING: And also, there's an election tomorrow, that last senate seat is up for gaps tomorrow. Juan, early this morning, Andy Puzder was named or at least tapped to run the Labor Department. Guy has 75,000 people working for him. Seems to me a logical, wise choice to run labor.

JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: So, no problem with the ladies in bikinis selling hamburgers? You have no problem with this?

BOLLING: So you're talking about the ""Carl's Jr."""" commercials --

WILLIAMS: Yes, I see a lot of feminist --

BOLLING: It's one of the restaurants --

WILLIAMS: Yes, they're not happy. So, but the real argument is that this is a guy who at a time of populist anger about income inequality is opposed to raising the minimum wage, also opposed to the idea that more Americans should be made eligible to receive overtime pay and wants to do away with that Obama era regulation.

BOLLING: Can I just check you on that one.

BOLLING: Andy Puzder supports president Trump. President-elect Trump's minimum wage raises that are ""rational and do not destroy jobs or the businesses supporting them.""

MELISSA FRANCIS, CO-HOST: Well, I think the difference is that he's a job creator not a job killer. And that he realizes that changing the federal minimum wage is putting a mandate on employers that doesn't necessarily make sense. I mean, saying that he isn't in favor of labor is like saying that a general doesn't love his troops.

I mean he's a guy that goes out there and expands business, builds it bigger. He understands what makes it tick. He is highly dependent on labor. I think he loves the guys that work for him and he's a great choice. He understands exactly how business works and how to expand it.

GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Are you talking about Andy Puzder? The guy that said that if he had his way he would automate his entire company because robots don't need health care, robots don't sue, robots don't do the slip and pay or whatever you call it?

GUTFELD: Slip and fall -- you're the lawyer. I tried it on you and it never works.

GURFELD: He employs 75,000 people, but on the whole, he would rather employ none. And by the way, I think it's a great choice. I think Puzder is a smart guy. I think he is smart on minimum wage. I think he's smart on overtime, but he's also smart on the realities of automation.

FRANCIS: He wants to automate. I mean who doesn't? He loves automation, grat.

GUTFELD: That's my point. So, you're kind of talking out of both sides here.

FRANCIS: You're going to have no employees at all. No, I'm not. You have to have automation in a business. He wants to keep the employees that he has.

GUTFELD: You're pulling away though. It's fast food.

FRANCIS: It's productive. Yes, you can't stop time. I mean --

BOLLING: Yes, that's my point, you can't. But what if you decided to punish time or punish progress?

BOLLING: But he is also the guy who is in favor of Donald Trump -- president-elect Trump's border policy as well.

BOLLING: Where there are a lot of illegal immigrants who are taking these fast food jobs that Americans could be taking. He promises to implement the agenda.

GUTFELD: I think that's a relatively new thing for Puzder. I think Puzder was definitely into cheap labor up until recently.

BOLLING: Well, I do not think he's for cheap labor. I mean, no.

GUTFELD: I think he was for open borders.

WILLIAMS: So, and let me say for all of our talk at this table -- and I'm worried about your job at the moment given your position here --

WILLIAMS: I think -- let's ask labor. Let's ask the people who run the AFL-CIO. They say this man fights workers. This man is hell on workers.

BOLLING: Juan, you call labor -- big picture labor -- the 11 million people who are in the unions? That's who you call labor? How about the other 130 million Americans who are working who aren't unionized who are against everything union?

WILLIAMS: Against everything (ph). I don't think that's true. I think what you're saying true, is there are fewer and fewer Americans who are in unions from the private sector --

BOLLING: It's 11 million. You know, that's 53 million workforce.

WILLIAMS: Because, look, wages have been going down. People are struggling at times for jobs --

WILLIAMS: No, but what I'm telling you is, big labor is not stupid. This is like the attack on Chuck Jones the other day by Trump.

BOLLING: Big labor is stupid. They are pricing themselves out of the market.

GUILFOYLE: Yes, they are.

GUILFOYLE: Because they're greedy and yes, when you are in a party pig like that.

GUTFELD: But you know what? The choice of Puzder is telling you what the future is. The future is automation. So all of this stuff about saving 1,000 jobs here and 1,000 there, it's not going to stop automation, well, that's artificial intelligence. It's not.

FRANCIS: No, but can I tell you what the difference is though? The automated factory is going to stay here because when it comes down to where they want to have their factory -- I mean, of course, CEO's would rather have it here. They can keep a closer eye on production.

They know that the workers that are there are more efficient, are better. They need lower cost regulation, lower taxes, cheaper energy because we are drill, drill, drill. And they'd rather have the factory here. Yes, the factory is going to have fewer workers but you need some workers to run alongside those robots.

FRANCIS: But it would be better than having the factories in China where they can't keep an eye on it where a bunch of products are so much --

GUTFELD: So you would say it's okay to apply tariffs to a company to keep them from going to China?

FRANCIS: No, I think that's he's opening salvo and then negotiation. I think he's saying we're going to throw this tariff on and I think that that's how you reset the negotiation. I don't believe it would ever come to that or he would actually do that. But if God knows like it's going to, don't tell anyone (inaudible) that he's not going to actually do that but I think he is.

BOLLING: And the Carrier deal, that was a threat, but I'm not sure that they stayed or these jobs -- the 800 stayed because of that. I think it was because it was a good deal to stay tax-wise. They got tax breaks. They got incentives. They got investment and if --

WILLIAMS: What did Sarah Palin call it? Crony capitalism.

BOLLING: And she was right.

WILLIAMS: What did George Will say? Socialism.

BOLLING: I would say George Will is completely off his game. I think George Will at that time was --

GUTFELD: Why? You can't say that. He's right. He's talking about the (inaudible) of free market principal.

BOLLING: The free market principals say if you lower taxes, more corporations will hire more people.

GUTFELD: Yes. But then you don't need coercion to go along with that. You're saying lower taxes as the carrot for the stick.

BOLLING: But he never -- he hasn't coerced anyone. He's not even president yet. He can't coerce anyone at all.

GUTFELD: So he never brought up 35 percent tariff?

BOLLING: He brought it up and he didn't coerce. What he did was secure --

GUTFELD: That's a threat. He did say it was a threat.

BOLLING: Right. He secured millions of dollars of tax incentives. That is what --

WILLIAMS: And Carrier secured millions of dollars of --

BOLLING: Hold on. All right, hold on guys

FRANCIS: It's their money, their money.

BOLLING: Who is the governor of Indiana?

WILLIAMS: Why wouldn't the next guy say give me some of that?

BOLLING: Of course they should and hopefully they get it.

WILLIAMS: This is not a system, an economic system --

BOLLING: Do this. This is a great idea.

WILLIAMS: Eric, this is what they call picking winners and losers.

FRANCIS: No, it's not.

FRANCIS: Why are you against companies keeping their own money? It's not taxpayer money. It's Carrier's money --

WILLIAMS: Oh, well, go for it. Well, then they don't need Indiana's money?

WILLIAMS: Why are they asking for Indiana's money?

FRANCIS: It's their money. They earn profits for giving less of it to the government.

GUILFOYLE: OK, business 101 during the break.

BOLLING: OK, let's do this. As we mentioned earlier, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has removed his name from consideration for a position in the Trump administration, even though he is no longer a contender for a cabinet position. The transition team says Giuliani may join the team at a later date. Giuliani spoke about it moments ago.

RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: My desire to be in the cabinet was great, but it wasn't that great. And he had a lot of terrific candidates and I thought I could play a better role being on the outside. That was the only one I had any real interest in.

BOLLING: So, we bring it around KG. Rudy said -- the former mayor says he pulled himself out of contention. What do you think?

GUILFOYLE: And he did that on the 29th. Removed himself from contention and wrote a letter that they did not want to accept at first because they still wanted to keep him in consideration. He always said that he would be there for this candidate, for president-elect Trump. He was.

He was a very important surrogate on his behalf and very loyal. I'm sure he's going to continue very strongly to be an adviser. Anyone would be lucky to have Rudy Giuliani in any capacity. There are a number of roles he could have fulfilled beautifully in the cabinet so, you know.

Obviously, I'd love to see him serving the country but he's got a very busy life, very active life and with his wife, Judith. So, he's got a lot of options. Let's see what happens.

BOLLING: What about deputy? No one wants to be the deputy?

GUTFELD: Yes, nobody wants to be the deputy. They all want to be the sheriff. Is that how it works? But anyway, he's a great guy. He's like our Churchill in a way. I mean, he was an inspiring person. I hate to say was but I feel like he's retiring and he's pulling back. But he can still be one lucky guy at outnumbered.

GUTFELD: He will be back here.

GUILFOYLE: Well, he just got an award in Colombia for reducing crime there just last night. I mean, you know, he's incredibly talented.

BOLLING: This is an important point. He does very -- his security company does very well internationally advising foreign countries on security.

FRANCIS: Maybe that would have been one of the challenges. I mean, that's one of the things that a lot of people talk about, is that in the process of a confirmation, that he has a lot of interests all around the world that could have been a challenge. He's America's mayor. We love him. What are you going to do?

GUILFOYLE: But he also was thoroughly vetted so, that process already was completed.

BOLLING: What do you make of all this?

GUILFOYLE: Well, I don't buy that he was fairly vetted. But I do buy this, that --

GUILFOYLE: He said it in the interview.

WILLIAMS: I know, well, I would say it, too. But I don't know if it's true. But I'm just saying, I think Rudy Giuliani could have been a great attorney general. I think in fact, he might have done better than Jeff Sessions, the senator from Alabama in terms of getting through.

But what strikes me is he was held on a string. If you remember, when we started these conversations, everybody assumed he was going to get the job. We don't know if he's qualified. Doesn't have a lot of foreign policy experience. But it was assumed he's going to get the job.

Then it starts to go Romney, Petraeus, Senator Corker and maybe he got tired of this game. I mean, he makes a lot of money now going overseas doing the things Kimberly was talking about, giving speeches.

BOLLING: All right. They want us to leave it right there. A programming note, tune in to Fox News Sunday for an exclusive interview with president- elect Donald Trump. Check your local listings.

But up next here, disturbing new details about this illegal immigrant on the run after -- on the run, I'm sorry, after allegedly killing two women in Kentucky. How Mr. Trump's tough immigration stance might fix problems like this when we come right back.

GUILFOYLE: Is this the exact problem Mr. Trump is trying to fix? This man you see on your screen, an illegal immigrant from Mexico is wanted for allegedly killing two people in a hit and run case in Kentucky. Guess what? He has been deported eight times. At his thank you tour stop in Iowa last night, president-elect Donald Trump reiterated his campaign pledge to build a border wall and crack down on illegal immigration.

TRUMP: On immigration, we will build the wall and we will put an end to illegal immigration and stop the drugs from pouring into our country. The drugs are pouring into our country, poisoning our youth and plenty of other people.

A Trump administration will stop the violence that is spilling across our border. And believe me, you've seen now, it is unbelievable how much there is.

GUILFOYLE: OK, so a strong messaging but this is consistent, Melissa, with during the campaign, what he talked about, cracking down on illegal immigration, cracking down on sanctuary cities that would have these people come in, revolving doors to come in to re-offend as criminal recidivist, much like this man did, and then deported eight times. What an insufficient broken system.

FRANCIS: Yes. No, I mean, this has become the issue. Of course, there are so many cities saying they're going to be sanctuary cities here in New York. Mayor de Blasio having a commercial in the back of taxis talking about how proud he is that he's refusing to cooperate with the feds.

I heard Greg say it before and it was so right, that the wall is like the red shiny bike under the Christmas tree, and God help him if the kids come down in the morning for Christmas and that bike isn't there. I mean, this is something that if he fails on this campaign promise, it's really tough.

At the same time, when people are so literal with the wall -- I mean he also said -- remember every time he said the big beautiful wall, he said with a giant beautiful door in the middle, like, do you really think there's going to be a giant door in the middle? I don't think it's quite as literal. Like a giant -- it's going to swing open --

FRANCIS: A giant brass knob on the big door and you open it up and you follow through?

GUTFELD: There's going to be a doggie door too for Jasper.

FRANCIS: I don't think it's quite as literal, but I agree with Greg that if it doesn't happen, yikes.

BOLLING: I think it's literal. I think he means what he says.

FRANCIS: With a big door? Is there a knocker?

BOLLING: No, no, no. I think he will build a wall. I mean, this is a brilliant idea. Not only to fulfill a campaign promise, but it also -- it's a massive infrastructure. You want to talk about trade and --

BOLLING: It's a massive infrastructure program that you could put a lot of people to work. And like he said, they're putting ways to make Mexico pay for it. Can we be a little (inaudible) down (inaudible). Here's an interesting opportunity for Andy Puzder to do something that Republicans haven't been able to do or aren't willing to do -- is to go after the companies who employ illegals as well.

BOLLING: Not only deport illegals when you catch them or put the wall up, but if a company like a fast food restaurant is employing illegal aliens, you penalize them. You make them pay for that. Now, this has not been a very conservative talking point, but I think Andy Puzder is the guy. If he is going do it, boy, this would be an opportunity to do it.

GUILFOYLE: Pretty exciting. OK, Juan, are you recovering from Bolling's comments yet?

WILLIAMS: Well, I just think -- I really appreciate that you shouldn't take him literally on the wall. There might be a door. I think he said in some areas there might be a fence. We'll get to it. I mean, I just think, look, this is a waste of money, waste of time. If you're looking for jobs, Eric, there's so much that we need in terms of infrastructure in the country.

I would hope that we can do other more meaningful projects. But what concerns me, Kimberly, the demonization of all illegal aliens because of the crimes committed by this one man. He has been deported several times. I think the case that Bill O'Reilly talks about all the time in San Francisco is even a better example because that guy just freshly got out of jail.

But you can't, it seems to me, connect crime and illegal immigrants in any significant way because, in fact, crime has gone down. Violent crime has gone down even when immigration -- illegal immigration is going up.

BOLLING: The incidence of violent crimes is higher among the illegal --

WILLIAMS: That's not true. That's absolutely not true.

BOLLING: According to the FBI in --

WILLIAMS: No, no. What the FBI says is you have more illegal immigrant -- I think its 37 percent illegal immigrants in jail.

WILLIAMS: But you know why they're in jail, Eric? Not violent crime. They're in for immigration violations.

BOLLING: They commit crimes at a higher rate than the population.

GUILFOYLE: No, no, no. They are not in there for immigration violations.

GUTFELD: You know what amazes me? Can you show the picture of the guy?

GUTFELD: What drives me crazy, if you take a look at this fellow, illegal alien deported eight times is well fed. He's just well fed. I mean, if this is how our country operates. He has been deported eight times. That's once every six weeks. He gets deported more times than I get a haircut.

For him it's like running a 5k if he actually exercised. So the problem here isn't just that he's an illegal alien. It's that there are no consequences for the incompetence or the supervisory incompetence. It may not be the officers.

And maybe that they're told not to stop this, and if they're told not to stop that, that has to be addressed. There has to be a punishment for the incompetence so that this doesn't happen.

BOLLING: They are told not to stop this. They are sanctuary city.

GUILFOYLE: It is. It's a hundred percent to -- I'm telling you. I lived there. I worked there. I rented (ph) there and I'm telling you that you'd go in as a prosecutor into court and you would be the bad guy.

The prosecutor of the White House is a bad guy because he would ask the person on the other side of the table there to please identify yourself by your true name. And they would give you about 16 different aliases, lie about everything. You'd have to run them through the print system. Find out they have a hold.

And then the public defender would just try to get them out and then specifically not turn them over to ICE so they can come back into my courtroom again with another DUI or another criminal offense. They are not in the criminal system for an immigration violation, trust me.

WILLIAMS: There's any and every community which you can find criminality. But let me just say, speaking for big business -- can you imagine me speaking for big business? Big business, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Mike Bloomberg -- so many of the big corporations from Disney to Marriott (ph) are all saying that if Donald Trump goes ahead with this deportation force, it will devastate the American economy.

GUTFEDLD: OK, but we're talking about the specific examples of criminality and whether the criminality is worse or better among illegal aliens. If you have that person deported, that crime is committed, you should start calling him the deportables.

GUILFYLE: And here we go.

GUILFOYLE: And just on a quick programming note here, we're unclear as to why that individual looks well fed. He also could have a thyroid issue.

GUTFELD: Oh, we'll treat that. We'll treat that coming up.

GUILFOYLE: Directly ahead, Hillary Clinton takes aim at fake news. It's her warning about spreading false information. Legitimate or just an excuse for losing the election? Details, next.

WILLIAMS: Welcome back. In her first speech since losing the election, Hillary Clinton is sounding the alarm about the dangers of so-called fake news. This comes after online conspiracy stories involving her campaign sparked some violence.

HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Fake news can have real world consequences. This isn't about politics or partisanship. Lives are at risk. Lives of ordinary people just trying to go about their days to do their jobs. It's imperative that leaders in both the private sector and the public sector step up to protect our democracy and innocent lives.

WILLIAMS: With recent incidents like the Pizzagate incident in Washington, D.C. and most recently in Brooklyn, New York, does Clinton have a point? Greg, I want to go to you on this because it's not only Hillary Clinton. I mean several people are increasingly talking about this danger, even the Pope is saying this is --

GUTFELD: All right, first of all, this is a real story. Forget Hillary. We don't need to hear from her on this because I don't trust anything she says. Fox News should be talking about this because this is about news and this is a serious, serious problem. The poison of Pizzagate is that it shifted the burden of proof on to the accused.

If somebody calls you a child molester, it's up to them to provide the proof. They can't call you -- then you're returning to the Salem witch trials where you take a witch and you throw in the water, and if she drowns, she's not a witch. That's the mentality we are dealing with on the internet.

We now have parents of Sandy Hook children getting phone calls and death threats from people because they believe that Sandy Hook is a false flag operation. There has -- we are returning to the McMartin preschool era where you just say somebody is a pedophile and you ruin their lives. There has to be consequences for any of these people. You get -- the FBI should investigating these people and they should be sued for slander and libel. Do whatever is possible.

These small businesses that are being abused by these weirdos, they need to be able to have some action, some action to get back at this. I don't think Hillary helps because she politicizes this.

WILLIAMS: She has a legitimate right to --

GUTFELD: Fox News should be talking about this, not Hillary.

WILLIAMS: I agree with you, but you know, you have people who tweet us stuff like, until this story is proven false, it's a story.

WILLIAMS: That's crazy. That's what you are saying. Melissa, let me come to you. I read a story the other day that indicated this is not just a problem because, you know, some guy takes a gun into a Ping Pong Pizza in D.C., but it's a problem because people who are just trying to know what's going on in the world get confused and they no longer know what's trustworthy. It distorts the entire world of news.

FRANCIS: I guess. But I mean, what's the remedy? How do you police something like this? I mean, I understand the extreme example. But it's like, with people putting out stories, you need some common sense.

I mean, I feel like, when somebody is sharing a story that's ludicrous, I don't just believe it based on that somebody forwarded it in their Twitter or they booked it in their Facebook. I think they're a moron. You know I mean? You watch it and you look at it, and you're like, this can't possibly be true. Why -- why would I believe it? I mean, I just...

GUTFELD: There's an entire group of people who are pushing a story, pushing a pernicious, toxic story that are hurting people. There should be some retribution.

WILLIAMS: So Eric, let me come to you on this point. In the story that I read, it said there are lots of people, particularly on the right -- and I've heard this from Greg -- who take delight in the idea that there's someone picking on the liberals, someone who's saying they're up to nasty stuff, and so what if it's a little not true? They're still punching back at the left.

BOLLING: This is a big, big problem. And I think the only solution is Greg is right, have the legitimate news services get out in front of it and talk about it. And I'll tell you what it does do. It drives people to FOX News, CNN, ABC, NBC and stop reading these things that randomly pop up.

The problem is, some of them look like us. Some of them...

BOLLING: ... are putting logos that look a lot like...

BOLLING: ... our logos. Of course. But again, free speech, I get it. But when you're infringing on copyright -- there's also another issue, too. When you're a public figure, I think you forego your rights of being -- of suing for libel and slander. So when you're hitting Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton has some sort of pedophilia thing going on with the pizza - - pizza place in D.C., she doesn't really -- she's not covered under the law. But the average citizen is.

BOLLING: The pizza guy is. He's not a public figure yet, and so he should be.

BOLLING: Who do you sue?

GUTFELD: You have to get the names of the -- they found -- they found one woman who was behind the Pizzagate story who published it on her website, finally.

BOLLING: Sue the Internet provider that hosts the story, not the person that posts it. Or both.

FRANCIS: I mean, I -- I agree with the sentiment of what you're saying.

GUTFELD: Like shouting ""fire"" in a theater. Right?

FRANCIS: It's -- but it's -- realistically, how do you deal with this? I mean, so then you go after the Internet provider. I mean, that's...

WILLIAMS: It's terrible. Let me -- let me...

FRANCIS: Then they've got to police everything that's going on all over the Internet?

WILLIAMS: I want to talk to...

WILLIAMS: I want to talk to Ms. Guilfoyle, the lawyer, if you'll allow me.

GUILFOYLE: Yes, the lawyer. Twenty seconds, the lawyer.

Please. Go to a real lawyer. Not a fake lawyer.

WILLIAMS: Will you give Ms. Guilfoyle the table?

WILLIAMS: We -- Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook is now asking Facebook users to help him find fake stories. Google says they're going to stop placing ads. But ""The Wall Street Journal"" reported just today, they said, ""You know what? Fake news is making tens of thousands of dollars because the big companies don't know that their ads are on these sites. The computers are automatically placing these ads. And so they're supporting fake news sites.

GUILFOYLE: Right. Well, obviously, they have to be a little bit more, you know, vigilant about researching and vetting the sites that they're involved with and make sure this doesn't happen. So it has to have a multifaceted approach. Right? You've got to do this thing. It's like Jeff [SIC] Zuckerberg is doing over there at Facebook.

GUILFOYLE: Mark Zuckerberg is doing over there to make sure that they're, in fact, checking it all out. Right? But at the same time, people also use some of their common sense to not be fooled by it.

And on a third note, Hillary Clinton is just trying to continue to make and find excuses for why she lost the election, even though she was a horrible candidate and herself being no stranger to creating fake news stories, like when she lied about Benghazi and said over the caskets of four Americans.

GUTFELD: Or the bullets in -- with getting hit by fire.

WILLIAMS: I won't go into that.

All right. When we come back, new questions about conflicts of interest for President-elect Trump. This time, for his ties to ""Celebrity Apprentice."" Oh, my goodness. Details coming up next.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A lot of times it falls on the project managers. But, you know, I did come up with the jingle, but I want to stay here. I want to win.

DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: OK. But you wrote the jingle?

FRANCIS: President-elect Donald Trump will not be firing anyone else from NBC's ""Celebrity Apprentice."" In fact, Mr. Trump is keeping his title as executive producer of the reality show after he takes office. The series is returning after a two-year hiatus, hosted by Arnold Schwarzenegger.

In the meantime, Kellyanne Conway is pushing back against the hypocrisy of critics who are slamming the move as a potential conflict of interest.

KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP SENIOR ADVISOR: Were we so concerned about the hours and hours and hours spent on the golf course of the current president? I mean, presidents have a right to do things in their spare time or their leisure time. I mean, nobody objects to that.

Whether it's President Obama or Donald Trump, the idea that these men are going to be all work and nothing else all the time, it's just unrealistic, because it's never happened in our lifetime.

FRANCIS: Kimberly, what's the potential conflict of interest here? That he's going to suddenly start liking ""SNL,"" because they're on the same network?

GUILFOYLE: There you go. Conflict of interest. He's going to have to all of a sudden think Alec Baldwin is very, very funny.

I mean, yes, I think they're going to check this out legally to make sure that there isn't any impropriety. If there were, then he would have to not have the executive producer title. So so far, I think this is clean. Maybe perhaps it's somewhat unconventional. But it is not, my dear friend, illegal.

FRANCIS: See, I think this is a decoy. This is like the shiny ball that he, you know, holds up in front of the crowd to distract you. Because it doesn't make any sense to be talking about this necessarily. I mean, executive producer, it's like a candy that they give out now to actors when they're not really -- you know, I mean...

BOLLING: That's the point. I don't think many people understand what that means. That doesn't mean he's going to be on the phone going, ""Yes, I want to see this activity going on.""

BOLLING: No. You slap ""executive producer"" on almost everything. Watch a movie. At the end of a movie, when the credits start to roll...

BOLLING: Yes, there's 15. And, you know, most of them are the ones who donated to the film.

So I see nothing wrong with this. It's intellectual property. He developed the show.

GUILFOYLE: One or two.

BOLLING: It was created prior to ever announcing he wanted to run for president.

Barack Obama wrote a book before he was president. If that book was made into a movie, it would be the exact same thing. No one would ask him to take his name off...

WILLIAMS: What happened to the profits from the last book Obama did?

FRANCIS: We don't know he's getting paid for this, though. We don't know he's getting paid.

WILLIAMS: So here's the -- here's the...

WILLIAMS: Well, we do know that he's made millions already.

FRANCIS: Yes, but we don't know he's going to get paid this time.

WILLIAMS: Let me say the problem here -- I'm amazed that you guys don't see the problem of the potential for the chief executive of the United States taking a paycheck not from the American people.

FRANCIS: We don't know he's getting paid.

BOLLING: You don't know that.

WILLIAMS: Or taking credit, having an interest -- Kellyanne Conway says he's going to be spending time on this. I don't think that's legit.

And I think that when you look at the idea that, you know, he stands there and says, you know, ""I have spare time. I'll do this."" What if he says, you know, ""I don't know if I'm going to do an interview with NBC, because I want a better time slot for 'The Apprentice'""? That's a conflict of interest. Isn't it? By definition.

FRANCIS: Greg, aren't you the executive producer of this program?

GUTFELD: Little known fact, yes.

FRANCIS: I had no idea. What is your opinion on this?

GUTFELD: My opinion is, forget conflict of interest. Make it a conflict of interest. You know, if you win ""The Apprentice,"" you get -- your apprenticeship is in government. You get a job on the cabinet. If you lose, you go to Gitmo. And everybody who loses goes to Gitmo, because Gitmo is awesome.

BOLLING: Geraldo's right there. Just when you said that, Geraldo...

GUILFOYLE: Geraldo is going to Gitmo?

GUILFOYLE: Geraldo, thank you for the chocolates.

GUTFELD: ... Newt was on ""Cavuto"" earlier, and I like Newt, because he always says the honest thing. He just goes, ""It's weird."" Didn't he say, like, ""It's weird""? He was like, ""Why would he care? Why would he want it?"" He gets -- he asks everything.

GUILFOYLE: There's a reason behind it.

FRANCIS: I know. That's why I think it's a decoy.

BOLLING: He developed the show. It's near and dear to his heart.

GUILFOYLE: This is his other baby.

BOLLING: His kids were involved in developing the show.

BOLLING: It would be like...

GUILFOYLE: I think he thinks Arnold is going to do well.

BOLLING: ... would you want to take -- would you want to take your book away from you, your name and rights to the book, if you became president.

WILLIAMS: By the way, he's having a news conference next week, I think on next Thursday.

WILLIAMS: Trump is going to have a news conference, which he hasn't done - - hasn't had one since Hillary Clinton.

FRANCIS: He doesn't need to. He won.

WILLIAMS: He shouldn't talk to the American people and the press?

GUTFELD: It's an interesting problem to have. This is the first pop culture president.

GUTFELD: The first president that came directly from entertainment.

GUTFELD: This is a new problem.

GUILFOYLE: So truth in advertising and therefore...

FRANCIS: Greg will be the next one.

FRANCIS: All right. Don't go anywhere. ""Facebook Friday"" is up next.

GUTFELD: Yes. ""Facebook Friday,"" your questions answered. This is a great one. I'm going to start with you, Kimberly, go around.

GUTFELD: From Michelle K.: ""In memory of John Glenn, would any of you want to go to space and why?""

GUTFELD: Nope. Any -- any reason why?

GUILFOYLE: Because it would be really tough to catch all the salami upside down.

GUILFOYLE: Bad hair. I don't know. That kind of scares me a little bit, to be honest.

GUTFELD: Yes. What about you, Juan? I bet you'd go.

WILLIAMS: I'd love to go. You know, I'm curious about this tourism business...

WILLIAMS: ... because it seems a little extreme. But if you really are going to do something, that would be cool. Like, the other day Steven Hawkins said we're going to have to find a new planet in 1,000 years, because we're going to use this one up. Especially with Trump as president, doing away with the EPA.

GUTFELD: Way to work that in there.

WILLIAMS: So I would, yes. But the other reason is because I love movies. Right?

WILLIAMS: So I think Sigourney Weaver's probably up there with the aliens. Right? And Jodi Foster, didn't she do ""Contact""?

WILLIAMS: Yes, so I would like -- there's nice people in space.

GUTFELD: I don't think Jodi would be into you, though.

BOLLING: I don't think so either.

So apparently, Elon Musk says in 10 years, he'll have a space station...

BOLLING: ... up on the moon to go visit. I would like to. But you know what I would rather do?

BOLLING: I'd rather be Speed Racer. I would -- Spritle and Chim-Chim and racing Racer X in the Mach 5 when it would leap canyons.

GUTFELD: It would. It was pretty impressive.

BOLLING: I want to be Speed Racer.

WILLIAMS: I think we saw the child in you. That's wonderful.

FRANCIS: I am officially terrified. I would rather lay on the beach.

FRANCIS: Would you join me laying on the beach? We can do that together. Nice sand...

GUTFELD: But -- but that's the beauty. If you lay on the beach, technically you are in space. We are on a spaceship, Earth. We are throating in space.

GUTFELD: We are flying through space right now. Probably in a tiny spaceship, compared to a lot of other ones. The other issue is pooping.

GUTFELD: Not having that. I don't know how you do that in space. I mean, think about the problems.

GUTFELD: People have thought about it. How do you -- you know, things happen. It's floating over there. You know, all of a sudden it's up over there. You've got to chase it.

BOLLING: He's right. It's an issue.

GUILFOYLE: How did this happen?

GUTFELD: All right. Now we're going to go this way.

GUTFELD: From Robert G., when -- great question. ""When growing up,"" Melissa -- when you were growing up -- ""which celebrity posters or pictures did you have hanging on your wall?""

GUILFOYLE: Her own. Her own. ""Little House on the Prairie.""

GUTFELD: They didn't have posters of ""Little House on the Prairie."" Come on.

GUTFELD: Any of the Cassidys.

FRANCIS: OK, yes, any of the Cassidys.

GUTFELD: He still looks the same.

FRANCIS: I had all kinds of Billy Idol going on in my room. Every single poster. It was a little frightening for my parents. And these tiny little buttons that you put...

GUTFELD: Were you dancing with yourself?

FRANCIS: I'd put them on my teddy bear, which is, like, a kind of mixed up, scary thing.

BOLLING: ... which a lot of guys did. But my mom let me have it. But it had to be in the closet. It wasn't allowed to be on the walls. It was in the closet.

GUILFOYLE: And then you married Adrienne, much better looking.

BOLLING: Don't talk about coming in or out of the closet with that one. But I was a huge, huge Rolling Stones and Aerosmith fan. So anything Stones or Aerosmith went up on my walls.

BOLLING: Or The Who.

GUTFELD: What about you?

WILLIAMS: You know, I -- you know, my dad is involved with boxing. I love boxing, so it's odd characters like Alfredo Benitez, who was just a great boxer. But Ali. You know, I just like boxers.

GUILFOYLE: Yes, yes. One time I got this magazine. It was, like, ""Teen Beat"" or something.

GUILFOYLE: Yes, maybe that was it. And it had a free poster in there.

FRANCIS: Of course. And so I was like, OK. And I put it up. And then I put it up, and that was that. And it was nice. And then I eventually got to meet him. And then...

FRANCIS: Were you disappointed or happy?

GUILFOYLE: No, I was quite happy. And he sang to me. He has a beautiful voice.

GUTFELD: Wow. I used to have -- I used to have posters...

GUTFELD: ... of Lancelot Link, which was a money dressed as a detective. But I had posters underneath it. So that was the whole key. Is we always had posters that hid other posters so your parents never knew what you were really looking at.

GUILFOYLE: And what posters do you have, now?

FRANCIS: No, no. Don't ask that.

GUTFELD: I don't think you want to know.

All right. Start with you, Eric. From Cindy E., ""What did you want to be when you grew up?""

BOLLING: It's true. That's all I got for you.

GUTFELD: Quickly, Juan, what did you want to be when you grew up?

GUTFELD: A journalist? Wow, you were an exciting kid. Yes.

GUILFOYLE: Well, I wanted to be a prosecutor, and I did that. And then I decided, OK, I want to work in television. I did that. And now I decided I wanted do something else, and I'm going to do that.

FRANCIS: What was the other thing? Wait, can we come back to that?

GUTFELD: Well, we know. It's mayor of New York.

BOLLING: Is it? Or is it something else?

FRANCIS: What is it?

GUILFOYLE: Greg wants to write all of my mayoral speeches.

GUILFOYLE: No, but Bo Dietl's running for mayor.

GUTFELD: Oh, that -- is that -- really?

BOLLING: That's true. That is true.

GUTFELD: That's going to be -- that's going to be amazing.

WILLIAMS: And he told me he's running as a Democrat.

GUTFELD: That's the only thing you can do.

When you were a child, you already had a job.

FRANCIS: I was an actress, so I wanted to be everything. I was going to be a president and an actress and also a doctor. So I would, like, slip out to do an episode of ""Knots Landing"" and then, you know, go see some patients and then come back and protect the free world. I was going to just do it all at once.

GUTFELD: I would dress up as you often. You know, that still hasn't stopped.

FRANCIS: I do that now.

GUTFELD: One day I will be you. I will wear your skin, Kimberly. That's from ""Silence of the Lambs.""

BOLLING: You better be nice.

WILLIAMS: That's exactly what I thought.

GUILFOYLE: You're so Hannibal Lecter. You know that?

All right. ""One More Thing"" is up next.

BOLLING: All right. Time for ""One More Thing."" Juan is first -- Juan.

WILLIAMS: Today one of Hollywood's greats turned 100. The dimpled and macho, guess who? Kirk Douglas.

KIRK DOUGLAS, ACTOR: A free man dies, he loses the pleasure of life. A slave loses his pain. Death is the only freedom a slave knows. That's why he's not afraid of it. That's why we all win.

WILLIAMS: People remember Douglas as the star of ""Spartacus."" But he was also in other classics, like ""Lust for Life"" and ""Paths for Glory.""

He's been with his wife, Anne, now for over 60 years. And he's still making appearances with his son and fellow actor, of course, Michael Douglas.

Happy birthday to you, sir. You are a joy.

WILLIAMS: Also, I want to send a quick shout-out to one of our fans here at ""The Five,"" Dr. Jerry Den Herder. Dr. Den Herder had a stroke this week, but he's such a big fan of ""The Five,"" check this out, Gregory. The first thing he did in the hospital, he demanded that the nurse switch the TV to FOX News so he could watch ""The Five,"" Eric. ""The Five."" Best wishes for a speedy recovery to Dr. Den Herder.

GUILFOYLE: I know. OK, so, time for...

GUILFOYLE: I love it. I love it. So -- Greg, please.

So Madame Tussauds in London has unveiled a special version of the royals wax figures this week, featuring each member in a Christmas sweater. Greg, look at how cute. Four real-life Corgis joined the photo shoot. The queen is a big fan and is wearing a little Corgi sweater. How adorable is that?

GUILFOYLE: This is not your turn, Greg. The royals actually granted permission for it as part of U.K. charity, Save the Children. Do you care now, Greg?

GUILFOYLE: Christmas Jumpers, a campaign. It starts on December 16 and encourages people to throw on their festive knits that day and donate to the cause. You can wear one of your unicorn sweaters.

GUTFELD: All right, then.

BOLLING: All righty. So tonight, make sure you tune in. Big ""O'Reilly Factor."" Donald Trump is going to go to Lansing, Michigan, and talk to them on the thank-you tour. You've got to stay tuned, because part of that will probably go into that hour.

But then Rudy Giuliani is going to join me to talk about exactly what we're talking about earlier. First time on camera, actually, talking about the secretary of state pick. And we'll figure out...

GUILFOYLE: And where he'll be this weekend at the -- right? -- Army-Navy game with the president-elect.

BOLLING: At the -- at the football game, Army-Navy football game.

GUTFELD: I said it. I've got Ambassador Bolton. We're going to hopefully talk to him about what's going on in that mustache of his. Erin McPike. We've got Kat Timpf. And Tyrus, a new employee of FOX News.

BOLLING: Oh, is he? Made a contributor?

GUILFOYLE: Yes, and by the way...

BOLLING: Do you think I could take him?

GUILFOYLE: Rudy Giuliani said that his pick would be John Bolton, by the way. So you can ask him Ambassador Bolton about that.

BOLLING: Let's get Melissa in here.

FRANCIS: All right. So since I'm in Dana's chair, I feel compelled to do something about a dog.

FRANCIS: And this is how they do Christmas in Clearwater, Florida. It is too warm for Santa and his reindeer. So that substitutes for a reindeer. That is Ollie, out in his red sleigh, delivering gifts.

Actually, so that's my mother-in-law's dog. I stole her son, so she got a giant dog.

This is -- he was out looking for Abby Huntsman here, ringing the bell at Salvation Army. She was down in a diner nearby, but he missed her, so he went home to watch a little football and get some weather. That is Ollie, a fantastic dog.

BOLLING: We've got to leave it right there. We've got eight seconds or so.

FRANCIS: They tell me that (ph).

BOLLING: Guess what's coming up right next?

538,"It was ten years ago today since the infamous Pizzagate incident marked the end of Arsenal's 49-game unbeaten run.

Cesc Fabregas allegedly threw a slice of pizza at Sir Alex Ferguson, landing on his face before sliding down his suit to the floor, in part of a full-time tunnel bust-up.

It all started when Ruud van Nistelrooy complained to Ferguson that Arsene Wenger had been giving him stick throughout the game - thus leading to a furious Fergie confronting the French boss.

But nobody could have predicted what happened next.

""All eyes turned and all mouths gawped to see this pizza slip off that famous puce face and roll down his nice black suit,"" is how Andy Cole described the debacle in his autobiography.

The ""Battle of the Buffet"" also reportedly had soup and sandwiches launched from team-to-team, as the Premier League's marquee fixture of the season descended into a school-like food fight.

But where are all the players from Pizzagate now? Here is where you can find them all...

The Northern Ireland stopper turned out 49 times for Manchester United in the Premier League, before departing Old Trafford in 2005 to become a textbook football journeyman, having spent time at - deep breath - West Ham, Rangers, Derby, Odense BK, OFI Crete and Olympiacos. He can currently be found between the sticks at Notts County.

G-Nev hung up his boots in 2011 having racked up 602 appearances for United and now whiles away his days either arguing with Jamie Carragher on Sky Sports or putting the cones out for Roy Hodgson.

The ex-England defender called time on his trophy-laden Old Trafford career this summer, with a number of offers apparently sent his way. After much deliberation, he joined Harry Redknapp at QPR but has struggled for form since arriving at Loftus Road.

After departing United in 2008, the Frenchman joined rivals Arsenal on a free transfer. A couple of years at the Emirates followed before spells in Germany and the MLS. Silvestre has recently agreed a deal with Chennaiyin FC in the new Indian Super League.

The defender left Manchester for Madrid in 2007 before joining Marseille and then Roma. Heinze's career ended where it began, in his native Argentina with Newell's Old Boys, when he hung up his boots this summer.

Last spotted terrorising Liverpool at Anfield. The Portuguese has taken his game to another level since leaving Old Trafford. At Real Madrid, Ronaldo has smashed almost every goal record in sight alongside his impressive trophy haul. His sumptuous goal against Liverpool took him within one of Raul's Champions League tally.

United's go-to guy on the big occasions swapped United for Everton in 2005, where he captained the Toffees before retiring in 2013. That summer he followed boss David Moyes to Old Trafford as the Scot's first-team coach but departed after the ill-fated reign. Neville is now regularly found challenging his brother's punditry skills on Match of the Day.

The Red Devils' most successful player ever remains a firm part of the club's furniture. Following Moyes' reign, Giggs took temporary charge for the remainder of the season. Louis van Gaal's arrival saw the Welshman appointed assistant boss and marked the end of his illustrious career. Just the 963 appearances.

Rooney celebrated his 19th birthday in style 10 years ago by scoring the second goal. Plenty more have followed, along with controversies, with the England man taking the United armband this summer. He needs 30 goals to become the club's all-time top goalscorer.

The other scorer on that wet Old Trafford afternoon, Van Nistelrooy hung up his boots in 2012. After leaving the club, the Dutchman enjoyed spells at Real Madrid, Hamburg and Malaga and is now the assistant boss to Gus Hiddink with the Holland national team.

After never really making the grade at United, Howard moved to Everton on loan in 2006. That deal was made permanent the following summer and the American has remained on Merseyside ever since. Still one of the top goalkeepers in the Premier League.

After over 200 apperances, Brown bid farewell to his boyhood club in 2011 to join Sunderland. His tenure at the Stadium of Light has been ruined by injuries but he played a key role in the club's survival push last season.

United were so desperate to land Miller, they sealed a pre-contract agreement in January 2004 before taking him to Old Trafford that summer. Just nine league appearances followed before spells at Sunderland, QPR and Hibs. The Irishman can now be found at Brisbane Roar in the Australian A-league.

The Frenchman never lived up to the £12.4million United coughed up for him in 2004 as injuries hindered his progress. It was a similar story at Everton for Saha, although he did break the record for the earliest goal in an FA Cup final. Short-term deals at Spurs and Lazio followed before retirement in 2013.

Like Saha, Smith's time with the Red Devils was also dogged by injury woes. The ex-England man never really recovered from a leg break in the FA Cup at Liverpool and joined Newcastle in 2007. Smith managed just over 80 appearances in five years in the north east before moving to MK Dons. He is now plying his trade with Notts County in League One.

Now 44, the former German international stayed with the Gunners until 2008, making 199 appearances during that time. The mad-cap keeper moved on to VFB Stuttgart until 2010, when he returned to the Emirates Stadium, coming out of retirement to help the club amid a goalkeeper's injury crisis. Now often seen on Sky Germany's Bundesliga and Champions League coverage.

Rated by Arsene Wenger as one of his best ever signings, the Cameroonian left Arsenal in 2006 to join Portsmouth in their boom-to-bust years. However, he spent much of his time at Fratton Park as second-choice and eventually left in 2009. His final playing days came in Spain at Cordoba in 2010, after which he retired.

The 73-cap England defender left the Gunners after the 2006 Champions League Final - in which he scored - before spending time with Portsmouth, Notts County, Arsenal again and Newcastle. Released by the club in May 2011, he announced his retirement a year later.

The Ivorian defender remained in north London until a £16million move to Manchester City in 2009, having made 326 appearances for the Gunners. 103 appearances for City followed - as well as a Premier League winners' medal - before he joined Liverpool on a free transfer in 2013. Aged 33, he's still at Anfield.

After almost swerving off the road after only being offered £55,000-a-week, Cole left Arsenal to join Chelsea in 2006. In eight years he won a third Premier League, a seventh FA Cup (a record) and got his hands on both the Champions League and Europa League before leaving on a free transfer in 2014 to join AS Roma in Italy.

Now 37, Ljungberg has taken his footballing talents on something of a global tour since leaving Arsenal in 2007. West Ham, Seattle Sounders, Chicago Fire, Celtic, Shimizu S-Pulse and now Mumbai City - who he joined in 2014, two years after retirement - have all been called home by the Swede.

The Invincibles' captain, Vieira left Arsenal for Juventus in 2005 and took in Inter Milan and Manchester City before retirement in 2011. Now 38, the Frenchman still works for City, working as the reserve-team manager, having previously been the club's Football Development Executive.

The languid midfielder had a wonderful left-foot and was a key member of the Gunners squad during their best years - although not always necessarily as a starter. Left Arsenal in 2005 to join Valencia, before returning to his homeland in 2009 with Corinthians, where he is now director of football.

Signed for £17million from Sevilla in January 2003, the Spanish international showed glimpses of his talent at Arsenal, but never produced his best often enough. Joined Real Madrid on loan in 2006, where he won the Spanish title, before joining Atletico permanently the following year. Now back with Sevilla, with whom he won the Europa League (for the third time in his career) last season.

After 423 games and 120 goals for the Gunners, the Dutchman retired in 2006. Gone but never forgotten, a statue of the iconic No.10 was unveiled outside the Emirates in 2014. Bergkamp is currently back at first love Ajax, working as assistant manager to Frank de Boer.

Arsenal's greatest-ever goalscorer, in two spells with the club Henry struck 228 goals in 376 matches, while he also became France's record-scorer with 51 in 123 games for Les Bleus. Joined Barcelona in 2007 and conquered Europe, he has spent the last four years in MLS with New York Red Bulls. Expected to retire in November.

After making 18 appearances for the Gunners, his career never really kicked on after that. He has only made 62 appearances since his career began in 1997 - and that spans across 11 clubs. After spending three years at Manchester City from 2009 to 2012 without taking to the pitch once, he is now at Leeds United... and has again not made an apperance.

He was a mainstay in the Arsenal Invincible line-up but was soon moved on from the club once the unbeaten run came to an end. After featuring for a short period for Villarreal, the Frenchman signed for newly-promoted Italian second division side Cartagena before calling it a day. Now 40, he has no involvement in the game.

Arguably one of Arsenal's best players during the Invincibles period, Pires scored of average one in every three games from the centre of midfield. He is currently playing the Indian Super League for FC Goa, where he was recently reportedly punched in the face by an opposing coach. It is his first club in three years, after departing Aston Villa in 2011.

Well, this career got off to a dramatic start, didn't it. Reportedly the one to throw the pizza at Ferguson, Fabregas enjoyed his name in more glittering lights later in his career. Transferred to Barcelona in 2011, he has recently returned to England for city rivals Chelsea, where he has notched up an incredible nine assists already this season.

The Dutchman made the controversial switch from Arsenal to Manchester United in 2012 and continued his fine goalscoring form. He now has 40 goals in 65 appearances for the Red Devils. Now at 31-years-old, he has been entrusted with leading the line for United and Louis van Gaal's new-look front-line.",mainstream,M1a13a,pizzagate
192,"The son of Donald Trump’s pick for national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has lost his job in the president-elect’s transition team after he spread a false conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton that led to shots being fired in pizza restaurant.

While working for his father, Michael Flynn Jr tweeted an erroneous theory that Clinton’s allies had been running a paedophile ring in the Comet Ping Pong pizza parlour in Washington.

Even after a man on Sunday fired a rifle in the restaurant, in an incident apparently sparked by the conspiracy theory, Flynn said on Twitter that the fake news would “remain a story” until proven false.

The incident has heightened concerns about the incoming administration’s fondness for fake news and raised further questions about the suitability of Flynn Sr, who has also shared bogus stories on social media.

Mike Pence, the vice-president-elect, initially denied that Flynn’s son was working for the troubled Trump transition team. But on Tuesday he admitted on CNN that Flynn Jr had been helping his father, but that was “no longer the case”.

The New York Times reported that Flynn Jr had planned to work for his father as part of the national security council team, and started the process of getting national security clearance.

Since the election the Twitter postings of Flynn Sr have been uncontroversial. But days before the vote he tweeted a “must read” link to a story falsely claiming that Clinton’s emails contained proof of money-laundering and child abuse.

Flynn also promoted conspiracy theorists throughout the campaign. He encouraged his followers to read a book by Mike Cernovich, whose website has suggested Clinton’s campaign chairman was part of a “sex cult with connections to human trafficking”. Flynn also tagged white nationalist Jared Wyand on social media.

Speaking to the the New York Times, Michael Hayden, the former CIA and National Security Agency director, said: “The national security adviser should have a moderating effect on the instincts of the president, and it remains to be seen if Mike can do that.”

Julianne Smith, a former deputy national security adviser to the vice-president, Joe Biden, said she was deeply troubled by Flynn’s tendency to promote fake news. She told the Associated Press his job would be to “ensure that the White House is focused at all times on all of the threats that the United States faces abroad”.

Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Flynn’s willingness to promote fake news “raises profound questions about his suitability for this important position”.

Tom Nichols, a professor at the US Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, where Flynn obtained a master’s degree in national security and strategic studies in 2001, said: “If the national security adviser is going to be the direct conduit between the president and the national security world, of course it’s a concern that that adviser is being taken in by conspiracy theories and fake news.”",mainstream,M16b69,pizzagate

Bullshit, James Ball tells me, can get you into the Oval Office.

The former Guardian journalist and now special correspondent at BuzzFeed is well versed in separating fact from fiction.As a young reporter fresh out of university he started as an intern at WikiLeaks, working on the verification and publication of confidential US documents in 2010, and then on the Snowden leaks in 2013 during his time at The Guardian.

That’s all to say he’s developed a sixth sense for what is, and isn’t, bullshit.

With this in mind, today Ball is publishing his debut book as a solo author on the fake news phenomenon which has engulfed the world of politics over the last year.

We sat down with Ball to find out how half-truths, untruths and outright fakery took over:

Fake news, post-truths and bullshit, is this a new phenomenon?

This definitely isn't new: newspapers have run questionable stories for as long as they've existed, and fake news has circulated the web for just as long.

But things have changed a bit – fake news got political last year, because that was the way to get huge audiences.

So it's some old trends that have suddenly really come to the fore.



So who's to blame for fake news?

Russia! More seriously – all of us.

Fake news is just the most visible bit of what is a whole ecosystem of half-truths, untruths and outright fakery, or in other words, of bullshit.

When we share a story without thinking about it or checking, we're part of that system. When a hyper-partisan news site (think Breitbart or The Canary) over-hypes and spins a kernel of truth into something much bigger, that's part of it.

When mainstream outlets run too-good-to-check stories, they're part of it. And when Facebook and others profit off this whole system, they're part of it too.

Are there examples of fake news causing real harm?

The Pizzagate conspiracy – an alt-right theory that pizza parlours were harbouring secret child abuse sites used by leading democrats – led to an armed man storming a DC pizza parlour.

So the consequences of this stuff can be very real.

Polling shows Republicans believe Obama wiretapped Trump (there's no evidence he did), while many Democrats believe US election machines themselves were hacked (there's no evidence of this either).

When we all believe different facts, we can't have a public conversation – we can only have a shouting match.

So what's the solution? Will we ever be free of fake news?

The upside of all of us being part of the problem is that we can all be part of the solution.

We need to find ways to make corrections reach as many people as the initial bad reports and hoaxes do. We've got to find new ways to cover politicians and campaigns which deploy bullshit to win. There's no one big fix, but there's lots of little things all of us can do.

The fightback can start whenever we like.

427,"I am republishing this post from July 27, 2010 in view of Pizzagate, which gives this post a new significance.

 When you read this post, just remember that a pedophile is defined as an adult with “sexual fondness for and activity” with children, i.e., minors below the age of consent. In other words, the definition doesn’t require that there be sexual abuse of a child; sexual attraction to children is definitive. That in turn means that the Pentagon employees busted for child porn are pedophiles.

 

 Remember the news back in April 2010 that, while the economy crashed, senior staffers at the federal government’s Securities and Exchange Commission were spending hours surfing pornographic websites on government-issued computers while they were being paid to police the financial system?

 Now comes news that employees and contractors of the Pentagon are buying and watching child porn on the taxpayers’ dime. Not only is porn-watching on government computers illegal, it is against the law for all Americans to purchase and view child pornography. Worse still, some of the Pentagon child porn creeps have high-level security clearances, which makes them national security hazards because their sexual perversion makes them vulnerable to blackmail.

 On July 23, 2010, Dana Hedgpeth of the Washington Post reports that “Federal investigators have identified about 20 Pentagon employees and contractors accused of buying and downloading online child pornography and in some cases used their government-issued computers to view the illegal material.”

 According to a 94-page report released by the Defense Department’s inspector general’s office, some of those involved possessed top-secret security clearances and worked for such divisions as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA) and the National Reconnaissance Office. Those agencies deal with some of the government’s most sensitive intelligence and defense work.

 The number of Pentagon employees investigated was not disclosed in the report, but a Pentagon spokeswoman said the probe involved about 20 people who had an “affiliation with the Defense Department” as full-time employees, former military members or contractors. Some of those people have been prosecuted, and some of their cases were dropped for lack of evidence. Other cases remain open.

 The cases are part of a wider probe, Operation Flicker, which was started by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement four years ago and which has identified more than 5,000 people who subscribed to online child pornography websites.

 The cases detailed in the new report include one involving an employee of Oracle Corp. who had a top-secret clearance and worked on a contract for the National Security Agency. The man subscribed to various child pornography websites and made 21 purchases. After authorities started investigating him, the report said, he attempted to tamper with computers at his office. He was put on administrative leave with pay. He later fled to Libya but was arrested and extradited to the United States.

 Another case involved a government employee at the National Defense University in Norfolk who made two purchases from a child pornography website. He pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography and was sentenced to five years in prison.

 It is illegal to access pornography with a government computer.

Five years later, the Boston Globe discovered the Pentagon still had not investigated as many as 1,700 of the cases involving employees suspected of child-porn.

591,"Picture adult engagement with information as a continuum. On one side sits intentional (or actively sought) information, and on the other lives seemingly incidental (or passively received) information (see Figure 1). In this section, we address the two ends of this continuum and then discuss the space in between.

Our continuum is based entirely on work in schools and with teachers; however, a reviewer of earlier drafts of this article pointed us to Ross's (1999) concept of finding without seeking, which led us to Williamson's (1998) article, which distinguished incidental information acquisition from purposeful information seeking. These older studies serve to remind us that the concepts employed here are not new, although the ubiquity, speed, and scale of information encountered in the age of the internet is.

Educators need to address these challenges, but where are they to begin? As part of the SHEG ( 2016 ) study, the researchers compared the way students approached judging credibility with the way professional fact‐checkers approached the same tasks (Wineburg & McGrew, 2016 ). This is an interesting and important line of research, partly because it compares various kinds of readers and reading purposes and partly because it grows from an authentic example of adult interaction with text. We also see value in exploring the relation between identity and information seeking (Kohnen, in press ) and wonder how schools might design learning environments where students not only learn fact‐checking skills but also learn to value facts.

The utility of the rules for internet searching that are currently and commonly taught is suspect given the range of topics likely addressed in the upper left quadrant of Figure 2 . When querying settled issues that are uncontroversial, the rules may make some sense. However, the issues that fall into the upper left quadrant are often those that are most controversial or otherwise unsettled. The more current the question is, the less likely one is to find peer‐reviewed research on it; library scientists have described this as the information cycle. Navigating the digital floodwaters is perhaps most treacherous when users are in unsettled territory, but if educators are to prepare students for authentic, intentional searching, isn't it their responsibility to help students gather information about unsettled topics?

The high‐stakes searches should be a high priority for schools, but the small amount of information‐seeking instruction currently occurring appears to be almost exclusively focused on preparing students for searches that fall into the upper right quadrant of Figure 2 . Clearly, students should be exposed to what it means to search like an expert and should learn to use specific websites that historians, scientists, literary critics, or mathematicians find highly credible. Yet, should this be the only kind of information‐seeking instruction that students receive? After all, the upper left quadrant of Figure 2 (“highly important/low preparation”) is a place where we will all find ourselves at one point or another in our lives. Questions related to citizenship, personal finance, health, and consumer decisions may all fall into this quadrant.

Again, based on surveys and conversations with adults of all ages, we conclude that most people engage in intentional information seeking of all kinds at one point or another. Examples from Angela's perspective are included in Figure 2 for illustrative purposes, and we have invited dozens of adults to think about their recent information‐seeking endeavors in these terms. We hope that this graphic will help start a conversation about what it means to prepare students to be successful in different kinds of searches. In all likelihood, educators will see the low‐stakes searches as a low priority for schools; perhaps teachers might model via a search‐aloud (Saul, Kohnen, Newman, & Pearce, 2012 ) how they engage in low‐stakes searches of different kinds, but otherwise these kinds of searches probably demand little curricular space.

However, the internet‐searching rules imposed by many teachers do little to prepare students for the daily information needs of adults, needs that are not primarily academic or even career in nature. In fact, the banned resources are the bedrock of many of the searches that adults engage in as parents, moviegoers, hobbyists, and so forth (for more on Wikipedia, see Alvermann, 2017 ). We propose thinking about these needs in terms of two variables: importance (Is the information need high or low stakes?) and preparation (How well has your education and/or experience prepared you to deal with the information you find?; see Figure 2 ).

Searches undertaken in schools appear to be designed to help students succeed in formal academic environments. If the goal of schools is to prepare students to succeed as academics in training, it might make sense to ban Wikipedia; after all, academics do not usually cite tertiary sources such as Wikipedia in their formal writing. Likewise, perhaps teachers privilege .gov and .edu domain names because they associate these domains with an editorial process, and some teachers may encourage students to go to the databases in an attempt to steer them toward peer‐reviewed resources.

It appears that most teachers recognize how difficult navigating the digital floodwaters is for students and believe that rules are needed as basic signposts or clues. Yet, these rules do not teach students to assess the credibility of online information as a nuanced or critical thinking activity. Instead, these inflexible rules mask differences between websites that may have a similar domain name or the same suffix; do not account for the various kinds of information that exist online (e.g., blogs, newspapers, magazines, commercial product sites, professional and amateur videos); and privilege academic searches over other kinds of information seeking, as we discuss next.

Since 2009, we have been collecting survey, focus group, and interview data on the ways that students are being taught to access information online. We have also talked informally with teachers as part of other projects that take us into schools. Our respondents came from urban, suburban, and rural upper elementary, middle, and high school classrooms (grades 4–12) in schools in the U.S. Midwest and Southeast. We also discussed internet searching with a group of college students at a highly selective university (see Kohnen & Saul, 2017 ). Based on several hundred responses, the following trends became apparent:

Compounding the problem, high‐stakes tests, including state tests such as those developed by Smarter Balanced and the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers, as well as college entrance exams such as the SAT and ACT, do not currently demand that students find their own information. Rather, tests are scored on students' ability to read provided texts and cite relevant details from those texts in a coherent essay that answers someone else's question. In this environment, we have even heard principals characterize student curiosity as a potential distraction that must be managed. In sum, the answer to the question about whether the curriculum allots space and time for students' own queries and curiosities is often no or at least not enough.

Since the Common Core State Standards (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices & Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010 ) were unveiled, schools across the United States have devoted more time to informational and other kinds of nonfiction texts (see also the National Assessment of Educational Progress frameworks, on which the Common Core's reading and writing distributions were based). However, as noted earlier, these texts are typically teacher selected or curriculum dictated, with little input or effort on the part of students. Surely, teaching students to read and engage with complex nonfiction is a challenging task, and working with class texts may be a necessary or effective way to introduce certain skills or engage in whole‐group discussions. Yet, without time and space to explore their own questions and curiosities, students have little chance to practice their intentional information‐seeking skills in personal and motivating contexts. Understandably, teachers express worry that the curriculum is already too crowded; the unpredictability of student‐driven information seeking may feel, in one teacher's words, “just too hard.”

As this list makes clear, the information sought may be serious or trivial, uncontested or complex. Because intentional information acquisition implies action (from finding directions to choosing a diet plan to deciding how to vote), it also involves skills: the skills to seek, find, assess, and comprehend a wide variety of texts (often in a variety of modalities). Curriculum developers have deemed some information important and purposefully ignored other informational needs. For instance, few teachers teach or grade a young person's ability to follow a baseball team's efforts, even though they may recognize this effort as useful, engaging, and perhaps even wholesome.

At the other end of the information–acquisition continuum sits incidental information, the information that we are all exposed to on a near‐constant basis. The term incidental seems to imply that information is simply sprayed about and hits some of us. This is, to a limited extent, the case: An airport blasts us with television news, and a YouTube video is available only if one first watches an advertisement. Other forms of incidental information are targeted based on who one is (e.g., the targeted ads and articles that pop up on our computer screens), where one lives, or what one does. Regardless of why this non‐sought‐out information comes to us, the amount of incidental information that we encounter is astounding, as recent studies have estimated (see Bohn & Short, 2012; Short, 2013).

Schools have historically sought to ignore incidental information, despite the fact that it composes a huge proportion of the information diet. Yet, to bring incidental information and ideas thoughtfully into the curriculum, educators need to recognize first that incidental information is, in fact, a fund of knowledge. Until incidental information is recognized as such, educators will not be able to analyze its sources, its effects, or its role in students' lives.

Many scholars have discussed the disconnect between home and school literacies, particularly for students whose home cultures do not align with the culture represented by their school (e.g., Heath, 1983; Moje, Ciechanowski, & Kramer, 2004). In this same sense, it is important to note that incidental information should be considered a literacy that may or may not align with school discourse. Imagine the information that students are exposed to as part of their everyday, out‐of‐school lives through no seemingly active effort on their part: television and radio programs; websites that happen to be up on a computer or tablet when a student sits down to play or work with it; physical copies of magazines, newspapers, and books in the home; and automatic texts or RSS feeds that appear on a phone or in an e‐mail inbox. These sources often also inspire adult conversations that students may join or simply overhear. More important perhaps is the information picked up in dinnertime conversations or on outings with family members or friends.

The sheer amount of incidental information that students are exposed to outside of school may be a critical component of school success. In studies that focused on physical resources, Neuman and Celano (2001) and Neuman and Moland (2016) found socioeconomic differences in access to print for very young children, with children in low‐income neighborhoods having fewer print resources available. Neuman and Moland coined the term book deserts to describe the lack of physical books in areas of concentrated poverty. We suspect that there may be similar differences in the amount of incidental information that students are exposed to outside of schools and, surely, differences in the types and sources of such information, such as the kinds of books, magazines, and newspapers in the home; access to high‐speed internet and the technologies to take advantage of it; and adult conversations around incidental information. In other words, experiences with incidental information often help students do better (or worse) in schools.

The issue here is one of alignment. Although the amount and content of incidental information that young people are exposed to may differ across socioeconomic classes, a proposition that we have not investigated, all residents living in the United States in the 21st century are exposed to a great deal of incidental information. Yet, when incidental information aligns nicely with the discourses of school, the bar for learning new information in school is relatively low. However, when the incidental information to which students are exposed (perhaps because of class, culture, neighborhood, or other reasons) is quite different from or at odds with school discourses, the bar for school success is much higher. Said differently, experiences with incidental information likely make school harder or easier for students.

In contrast to a deficit model of thinking, Moll and colleagues (e.g., Moll, 2015; Moll, Amanti, Neff, & Gonzalez, 1992) focused on resource‐based pedagogy, a way of teaching that builds on what students, families, and communities know (i.e., their funds of knowledge). Inspired by Moll, we ask, How might incidental information be considered a fund of knowledge? How might teachers learn what incidental information makes up the backdrop of their students' lives and use this information as a resource for teaching?

From a student perspective and by our own definition of non‐sought‐out knowledge, the school curriculum often, if not always, focuses on incidental information. The curriculum is typically determined by someone else and is presented to students with very little, if any, input on their part. Even when students are in classrooms that promote active learning, the activity is almost always focused on learning predetermined concepts about predetermined topics; as noted earlier, in many schools, very little time is dedicated to students' own curiosities and queries. However, one of the gifts of an exceptional teacher is the ability to inspire students to move from passive information acquisition to active, intentional information seeking, often about topics that the students never considered before. Curricular units almost always start with students in a passive role in terms of topic, concept, or information to be learned; that is, although they may be engaged in active learning, they usually have not selected the curriculum itself. Yet, through the guidance of a teacher, students can take an active interest in finding out more. For example, Wendy (second author) recently witnessed an upper elementary science teacher teaching a unit on animals native to the state. Inspired by their teacher's enthusiasm, students eagerly researched a bird and wrote individual entries for a class book on “what makes native birds cool.” We doubt that many of the students in this class would have chosen to seek out bird information on their own prior to their teacher's invitation, but they found her enthusiasm and deep interest in their research irresistible. We suggest that our continuum of information acquisition may be useful for teachers as they think about the curriculum from the perspective of their students. Engaging students in active learning is not a new concept, of course, but the intentional end of the continuum is specifically about active seeking, not just activity in terms of classroom talk or movement. Our respect and even love for education was built on the efforts of influential teachers who inspired us to want to know more about a topic previously viewed as foreign and perhaps even boring. Although such engagement likely cannot happen for every student during every unit, including more opportunities for active, intentional information seeking on curricular topics is a reasonable goal.

Finally, we wonder how schools can equip students to recognize and respond appropriately when incidental information is a distraction. Today, adults and children alike struggle to manage the onslaught of incidental information. Incidental information, in the form of background radio or television programs or the constant influx of e‐mail and text messages, is ubiquitous. Images of couples staring at screens rather than making conversation and parents pushing children on swings while checking their phones have become cliché, but they also represent a frightening reality. Our students today live with a 24‐hour news cycle that must manufacture news to fill airtime; many also believe in the myth of multitasking and attempt to do homework while clicking back and forth among multiple information feeds. Learning to shut down or limit the flow of incidental information, or at least judge when it is worthy of attention, may be an overlooked 21st‐century literacy skill.",mainstream,M0abbd,pizzagate

941,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump returned Tuesday to his vision of a non-interventionist foreign policy for the United States, saying, as he did during his campaign, that he does not want American forces fighting ""in areas that we shouldn't be fighting in.""

At a ""thank you"" rally for his supporters in Fayetteville, North Carolina, Trump said his focus instead will be on defeating terrorists, including the Islamic State group.

""We will stop racing to topple foreign regimes that we know nothing about, that we shouldn't be involved with,"" Trump said, insisting the United States must end a ""destructive cycle of intervention and chaos.""

Fayetteville neighbors the U.S. Army's Fort Bragg, the world's largest military base, as well as the U.S. Air Force's Pope Field. Eight military installations dot the state.

Trump pledged to build up the military with the purpose of projecting strength, not aggression.

As a candidate, Trump frequently questioned whether NATO and other allies were pulling their weight. On Tuesday, he said he wanted to strengthen ""old friendships"" and seek new ones.

At the same rally, Trump formally announced his choice of retired Marine General James Mattis as his nominee for secretary of defense.

""Under his leadership, such an important position, we will rebuild our military and alliances, destroy terrorists, face our enemies head on and make America safe again,"" Trump said.

Michael O'Hanlon, a senior defense expert at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, called Mattis ""one of the best read, best informed and most experienced generals of his generation.""

Mattis has served as the head of U.S. Central Command, which carries out U.S. operations in the Middle East, and the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces.

The retired general will need a congressional waiver in order to be confirmed as secretary of defense. Mattis otherwise would be ineligible to serve because of a law that requires a seven-year wait for former members of the military to serve in the post. He has been retired for less than four years.

Pizzagate



 Trump's transition team also cut ties Tuesday with Michael G. Flynn, the son of the president-elect's choice to be national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn.

The younger Flynn had an advisory role with his father and an official transition team email address, though the exact extent of his involvement with the incoming administration is unclear.

He came under intense criticism for sharing fake news stories, including spreading the so-called Pizzagate conspiracy that alleges a pizza place in Washington, D.C., is involved in a pedophilia ring with ties to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

A gunman was arrested Sunday after firing a shot inside the restaurant. He'd told police he'd traveled from his home in North Carolina to ""self-investigate"" the conspiracy.

After the arrest, Flynn again tweeted about Pizzagate.

""Until #Pizzagate is proven to be false, it'll remain a story,"" he wrote.

The elder Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, has his own history of promoting false claims, including some involving Clinton.

Earlier Tuesday, Trump appeared in the lobby of his New York office building with Masayoshi Son, the head of Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank, who announced plans to invest $50 billion in the United States with a goal of creating 50,000 jobs.

SoftBank had established a fund in October, along with Saudi Arabia and others, to invest up to $100 billion in technology companies. The $50 billion initiative announced Monday would come from that money. No timetable was given for the investments focused on startup companies.

Trump claimed credit for Son's commitment, saying on Twitter it would not have happened had he not won last month's election.

SoftBank owns U.S. mobile carrier Sprint, which two years ago had a proposed merger with T-Mobile rejected by regulators on anti-trust grounds. Analysts believe such a merger would be easier under Trump, who is a proponent of removing regulations he says are killing businesses.

Campaigned on jobs



 Trump, in his unlikely march to the White House, had campaigned on bringing more jobs to America, particularly in manufacturing regions hit hard by the recession and globalization.

The SoftBank deal is the second that Trump has used to boast about keeping his promises to voters. Last week, he announced that the Carrier Manufacturing Corp. would keep 800 jobs in Indiana instead of outsourcing them to Mexico. Carrier still plans to outsource hundreds of jobs from another Indiana plant.

Trump also wrote on Twitter that he wants to terminate an order for a new Air Force One, the plane that flies U.S. presidents around the world. The government has contracted Boeing to construct at least two new planes, which would go into service in 2024. The total cost was initially expected to be about $3 billion.

Trump wrote that ""the costs are out of control, more than $4 billion.""

Boeing responded to Trump's criticism with a statement saying at this point in the process only a much smaller amount of money has been committed.

""We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the president of the United States,"" the aerospace giant's statement said.

""We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program, allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.""",mainstream,M12936,pizzagate

Climate engineering is the single greatest assault ever launched against the web of life by the human race. WIth the single exception of nuclear cataclysm, climate engineering is the greatest and most immediate threat we face for a long list of reasons. The battle to expose and halt the ongoing weather warfare insanity should logically be our top priority. Reaching a critical mass of climate engineering awareness in the population is absolutely essential in this fight. We all have a responsibility to learn how to be effective with our awareness raising efforts, arming yourself with effective informational materials is an essential step. Understanding the basic building block facts of the climate engineering issue is also critical. Make your voice heard in the critical battle to expose and halt the climate engineering insanity.

885,"Use of color-coded bandannas in the gay and BDSM communities

The handkerchief code (also known as the hanky code, the bandana code, and flagging[1]) is a color-coded system, employed usually among the gay male casual-sex seekers or BDSM practitioners in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, to indicate preferred sexual fetishes, what kind of sex they are seeking, and whether they are a top/dominant or bottom/submissive.

Wearing a handkerchief on the left side of the body typically indicates one is a ""top"" (one considered active in the practice of the act/fetish indicated by the color of the handkerchief), while wearing it on the right side of the body would indicate one is a ""bottom"" (one considered passive in the practice of the act/fetish indicated by the color of the handkerchief). The hanky code was widely used in the 1970s by gay and bisexual men.

The wearing of various colored bandanas around the neck was common in the mid- and late-nineteenth century among cowboys, steam railroad engineers, and miners in the Western United States. It is thought that the wearing of bandanas by gay men originated in San Francisco after the Gold Rush, when, because of a shortage of women, men dancing with each other in square dances developed a code wherein the man wearing the blue bandana took the male part in the square dance, and the man wearing the red bandana took the female part (these bandanas were usually worn around the arm or hanging from the belt or in the back pocket of one's jeans).[2]

It is thought that the modern hanky code started in New York City in late 1970 or early 1971 when a journalist for the Village Voice joked that instead of simply wearing keys to indicate whether someone was a ""top"" or a ""bottom"", it would be more efficient to subtly announce their particular sexual focus by wearing different colored hankies.[3] Other sources attribute the expansion of the original red–blue system into today's code to marketing efforts around 1971 by the San Francisco department store for erotic merchandise, The Trading Post, promoting handkerchiefs by printing cards listing the meanings of various colors.[4]

Alan Selby, founder of Mr. S Leather in San Francisco, claimed that he created the first hanky code with his business partners at Leather 'n' Things in 1972, when their bandana supplier inadvertently doubled their order and the expanded code would help them sell the extra colors they had received.[5]

Bob Damron's Address Book is also notable when referencing the Handkerchief Code. Starting in 1964, a businessman by the name of Bob Damron published a book of all the gay bars he knew from his constant travels across the United States. “This book fit comfortably in the palm of your hand,” a description reads. “Despite its petite size, this book was an impressive accomplishment. Each one of the listings he had visited himself. Every last copy of the book he sold himself.”[2] Bob Damron's Address Book also published a yearly chart for the meaning of each colored hanky under the title ""COLOR CODES"".[2]

This table is drawn from Larry Townsend's The Leatherman's Handbook II (the 1983 second edition; the 1972 first edition did not include this list) and is generally considered authoritative. Implicit in this list is the concept of left/right polarity, left as usual indicating the top, dominant, or active partner; right the bottom, submissive, or passive partner. Negotiation with a prospective partner remains important because, as Townsend noted, people may wear hankies of any color ""only because the idea of the hankie turns them on"" or ""may not even know what it means"".[6]

The longer lists found on the web are more elaborate and the many color codes in them are less often used in practice, although some of these colors are offered for sale at LGBT stores along with free cards listing their meanings.

While the hankie code was a semiotic system of sexual advertising popular among the gay leather community of the United States[7], it is no longer as popular in the modern day era. It may be seen as something kinkier to use in gay pornography, or at sex and fetish events like the Folsom Street Fair. Social networks may have replaced the use of hankies in cruising areas by digitizing the process. By using online platforms, men who have sex with men (MSM) can eliminate harassment and violence that they may face in public.[8] Social networks for MSM also allow for sub-groups, and for people to list fetishes, and what they are looking for, which is where the replacement of the need for hankies may have come from.[8] Grindr is the most popular app for MSM who use social networks for cruising, with an average of 1.3 hours per day spent on the app per user.[9]

1248,"SO WHAT’D YOU THINK OF MEGYN KELLY’S ALEX JONES FEATURE LAST NIGHT? Putting aside the fiery debate about whether Kelly and NBC News were right to give such primo airtime to a man who has spread dangerous conspiracy theories like Pizzagate and the Sandy Hook hoax nonsense, the question for many journalists ahead of last night’s highly-anticipated “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly” segment was all about how tough Kelly would prove to be in grilling her controversial subject -- just three weeks into her new program, at that. Given how high the stakes were as a result of last week’s public outcry, one assumes the editors at NBC News were working overtime to make sure the piece was as tough as possible. And given the favorable reviews, one assumes the network is happy with the .

-- The Infowars boss downplayed his relationship with President Trump: “I think my influence on Trump is way way lower than what MSM has said.” Kelly: “Well what kind of access do you have?” Jones: “He's just called sometimes and, you know, talked about politics or thanked me, stuff like that. That's it.”

-- Ridiculous statement: “The media never covers all the evil wars it’s promoted.” Kelly responded, “That doesn’t excuse what you said about Newtown, and you know it.” But really, she coulda/shoulda nailed him on the “media doesn’t cover wars” part.

-- This is more like it: “You misstated facts about Chobani and its owner which, you could’ve found out if you just had a reporter do a little shoe-leather reporting -- pick up the phone, check out the facts. You never would have had to retract that or apologize.”

-- “Do you think of yourself as a journalist?” Jones: “I have some journalists that work for me and I do journalistic work and I’ve broken a lot of big stories and I understand the basics of it.”

If you missed it last night, you can watch the full clip .

Veteran CNN TV critic Brian Lowry: “[T]he piece that aired Sunday credibly justified covering the Infowars phenomenon, which was the bar that ""Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly"" ultimately had to clear. … Moving into a prosecutorial mode that was frequently her strength on Fox, Kelly did press him, enlisting a Newtown parent and MSNBC contributor Charlie Sykes to help contextualize the ‘toxic paranoia’ that he spreads among his listeners. … Kelly's handling of the interview should calm some nerves [at NBC News], even if it won't quiet all the dissenting voices.”

Our own Jack Shafer: “[S]he took the mendacious Jones apart in such a textbook manner you had to wonder what all the shouting had been about. … Short of waterboarding him, I don’t know what more Kelly could have done to expose Jones’ dark methods.”

EXCERPT - From my feature this morning, “The Not-So-Bitter Rivalry of Dean Baquet and Marty Baron,” over at POLITICO Magazine: “Baron and Baquet are the two most important newspaper editors in America right now, at a time when the media is tackling the most epic and consequential story of the past 40 years. … Many news organizations have been moving the needle on the Trump story in different ways … But when it comes to inside reports from intelligence and national security agencies, the Times and the Post, with their expanding rosters of veteran correspondents, have the greatest institutional advantages. In particular, the investigations into whether the Trump team colluded with Russia in the 2016 election have played to the historic strengths of both newspapers. … The result has been a resurgence of ink-stained combat that makes NYT v. WaPo the most compelling journalistic rivalry since the days of Baquet and Baron’s respective forefathers, Abe Rosenthal and Ben Bradlee. The other thing that makes the rivalry compelling is that unlike Rosenthal and Bradlee, who were cordial at most, Baron and Baquet are legit pals. ...

“And yet, looking back on their journeys to the ivory towers of American journalism, it’s equally clear that Baron and Baquet have been formidable competitors, if collegial ones, over the course of their professional lives. Perhaps no two editors’ careers have overlapped and shadowed one another so closely. In the past, they’ve each contended to be the top editor at The New York Times and to have all the power and influence that goes along with it. After decades of ups and downs for both men, Baquet eventually got that job, but at the same time, Baron got the glory and fame that only the most Herculanean journalistic achievements can confer. Now, their competition defines not only their careers but, to no small degree, the fate of the Trump administration. Every morning, each goes to work knowing that part of what he needs to do that day is to be better and faster than the other.”

SIDENOTE: SOME POST NUMBERS THAT SURFACED IN MY REPORTING - “A person with knowledge of company finances said the Post now has more than 900,000 digital-only subscribers at three monthly access levels — $3.99, $9.99 and $14.99 — with the majority of its customers registered at the higher two tiers. Based on those numbers, digital subscriptions could theoretically be in the ballpark of $100 million at this point. (In 2016, digital circulation at the Times was $232.8 million.) ... Digital advertising this year, according to the person with knowledge of company finances, is projected to be at least $120 million, up from roughly $100 million in 2016. (Digital ad revenue at the Times in 2016 was $208.8 million.) Since the Post, as opposed to the Times, is a private company and does not make its finances public, it wouldn’t hurt to take these subscription and revenue numbers with a grain of salt.”

712,"Pop star Taylor Swift is about to expose a dark Elite pedophile ring within the entertainment industry and the use of Satanic Illuminati symbolism used by celebrities under MK Ultra and Monarch mind control programs.

The singer claims to have recently broken free from the shackles of her own reprogramming to have a conscious awakening.

She recently told members of her inner circle that she’s “woke as f*ck” and that she plans on using her status and influence to “expose the truth”.

Her latest music video for her single Look What You Made Me Do, is riddled with symbols that represent pedophilia, Satanism, Reptilians and the Illuminati.

The lyrics to the song seem to be a direct response to the mind control programs used by the CIA and the Illuminati to subconsciously push agenda on the public.

Since its release researchers have been breaking down the hidden messages in Taylor Swift’s cryptic campaign, which included going dark on social media, and uploading mysterious clips of snakes.

The corporate-owned mainstream media has been quick to blast any suggestion of her exposé as nothing more than a “wild conspiracy theory”, which is much easier to swallow for the sleeping masses, but the message is so blatant, it’s difficult to ignore.

Let’s take a look at her messages that the mass media desperately doesn’t want you to hear.

TAYLOR SWIFT IS ABOUT TO REVEAL THE TRUTH ABOUT PIZZAGATE.

By now, you may have already seen the artwork (pictured above) for Taylor Swift’s upcoming album, that makes a clear reference to the Pizzagate/Pedogate Elite pedophile ring scandal.That newsprint layover represents more than just the media at large, according to Twitter user @ReputationEra17: “The font in #Reputation album cover represents the font used by most of the Newspaper i.e NewYork Times and ofc there is a 10% shade. #TS6.”

Taylor Swift is specifically calling out the lying, liberal, mainstream fake news machine—the very one that covered up Pizzagate, the conspiracy exposed by Wikileaks that revealed establishment Democrats ran child trafficking rings in Washington, D.C.

The spiraling triangles in the video mean globalists are losing control.

According to 4chan, not only is Taylor Swift about to reveal the realities of Pizzagate, she’s also trying to show that the globalists are crumbling before our very eyes.

At about the three-minute mark in the lyric video for “Look What You Made Me Do,” triangles appear to swirl.The same pedophile triangle symbol also quickly flashes up at the beginning, almost subliminally.

Triangles are the universal symbol for pedophilia, employed by pedophiles Elites across DC and Hollywood to covertly advertise their human-trafficking rings.

Or, as 4chan summarizes: “Pizzagate is unraveling, and spiraling out of the globalist’s control. Also, right after this sequence, the whole screen flashes yellow for the first time.”

Yellow is only used sparingly in this video, and only as a reference to goodness or righteously exercised power.”The full-screen worldwide flash of yellow means the globalists are losing control of their mind control apparatus.”Their poison cloud is about to dissipate.”

The imagery has a deeper meaning if you know what to listen for.It’s more than just the lyrics that have deeper meanings, though.

After her feud with failed mind-control puppet Kanye West ensured that Swift would be forever linked to the snake emoji, Swift has clearly decided to reclaim that imagery.

According to one researcher, Swift “appropriated the snake and turned it around on them, the ouroboros eating itself like the left does, spiraling around to look like the pedo symbol…

.Swift’s desire to expose the Illuminati in the mainstream doesn’t seem to be a decision she has made lightly though, as she recently confessed to being a long-time 4Chan power user, in which she was using the anonymous message boards to expose dark secrets.

The users of 4chan have also compiled evidence that Taylor Swift posts among them, as shown in the image above.

Rumors of her 4Chan posting had already begun to swirl following Taylor Swift’s refusal to speak out during the presidential campaign.

Since Taylor Swift refused to denounce Donald Trump, as many other celebrities had, 4chan assumed this meant that she simply didn’t want to hurt album sales by coming out as a Trump supporter.

Just listen to the lyrics.

Lyrics paired with the images in the video, in particular, send a clear message: During the chorus, a bunch of Ouroboros with the line ‘Look what you made me do’ repeated. The left is constantly referred to as eating itself = snake eating its tail. Look what you made me do, therefore is a response to the increased radicalization of the left and the reactionary politics of T-Swift.”

The left is constantly referred to as eating itself = snake eating its tail. Look what you made me do, therefore is a response to the increased radicalization of the left and the reactionary politics of T-Swift.Taylor Swift seems to be following a trend of celebrities that have recently come forward to blow the whistle on Elite pedophilia.

Elija Wood, Brad Pitt, Katy Perry, Corey Feldman, and Robert Downey Jr. are just a few of the big names that have attempted to lift the lid on the pedophile networks in the entertainment industry and political world.It seems as though there’s safety in numbers though as more come forward to reveal the truth.",conspiracy,C0688a,mind.control; pizzagate
123,"It would seem that June 2018 culminated a lengthy ritual involving the sacrificing of 12 well-known celebrities and members of royal families. Whereas this will only be news to normies, there has definitely been a lack of coverage on the occultic aspects of these deaths.

It would seem that the normies/sheeple of the world have not batted an eye at the fact that 12 wealthy celebrities have all died in the same manner in the past few years under very similar and bizarre circumstances. Perhaps this is because the mainstream media refuses to report on their connections to elite pedophilia rings which tie directly to powerful people in Washington, Hollywood, and the mainstream media. People on the last presidential ticket in fact.

No. The mainstream propaganda media would have you believe that

12 independent and highly successful people with careers and influence hanged themselves on doorknobs. DOORKNOBS!!!

My first question is: How the hell does one hang themselves from a doorknob? Followed by: How common is this? Do people hang themselves from doorknobs regularly and I’m just now finding out about it? Is there a doorknob suicide club the rest of us aren’t aware of? Well, the answer to that last question is “yes.” One need only substitute the word “suicide” with “murder.” Or simply use the word “suicide” in the past tense while maintaining its usage as a verb. Eg.

Hillary Clinton opted to have Seth Rich die in a “botched robbery” as opposed to having him “SUICIDED”

You get the point. I would like the reader to know how excruciatingly hard it was not to list the other dozens of people who have committed suicide surrounding the Clinton administration dating back to the Arkansas days. But what does this have to do with “Doorknob Suicides” you may ask? Everything.

Pizza Gate, John Podesta (Hillary’s campaign manager, child rapist/murder), James Alefantis(Restaurant owner front for DC child prostitution ring), Henry Weinstein (Hollywood Rapist), Boys Town (Male Child sex ring catering to politicians), Israeli brown-stoning (Israeli control mechanism for the U.S. govt, Jerry Sandusky (Low-level Pedophile who took the fall), Jeffrey Epstein (child prostitute procurer for the elite), Hunter S Thompson (Snuff filmmaker), The Catholic Church (Enough Said). Hillary Clinton (Rapist, murder, Deep State Luciferian), . None of these murders/sex rings are mutually exclusive. What’s scarier is, they occupy seats of incredible power and operate within the normalized institutions of Hollywood and Washington while being insulated by media and pop-culture. The desire for the supply of children for both pedophile sex rings and ritual sacrifice date back to the days of monarchy and are alive and flourishing within the institutions flowing within the undercurrents of our society today.

So why did these 12 people die in nearly identical ritual suicides laden with occultic overtones? Quite simply because they were either in the thick of it or had information which would’ve exposed those at the heart of the pedophile networks.

Why Doorknobs? Why 12? Where is the 13th? Skip to the second half of this article for an explaination of ritual mechanics.

In order of “Suiciding” they are as follows:

INXS frontman Michael Hutchence’s body was found hanging from a doorknob in Room 524 at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Double Bay, Sydney. The occupant in the neighboring room heard an unidentified loud male voice and swearing at around 5 AM; the coroner was satisfied that this was Hutchence arguing with another male. On February 6th, 1998, after an autopsy and coronial inquest, New South Wales State Coroner, Derrick Hand, presented his report ruling that Hutchence’s death was a suicide.

According to reports, Hutchence had information regarding a “VIP pedophile ring” in the UK that was connected to child killing rapist Jimmy Saville and high-ranking politicians.

It should be noted that this was the first “suicide” of the 12 and began on the same day of the year JFK was assassinated. November, 22. Of course, the reason for this is because 11/22 add up to 33. A numerical masonic/occultic calling card to be sure. Hutchence’s age also adds up to 10 or “1” Visit my numbers study page for more info on this.

Perhaps the most occultic murder ot them all. Hollywood actor David Carradine was found dead in his room at the Swissôtel Nai Lert Park Hotel on Wireless Road, near Sukhumvit Road, in central Bangkok, Thailand. He was there shooting his latest film, titled Stretch. Really? Stretch? A police official said that Carradine was found naked, hanging by a rope tied to the doorknob of the room’s closet leading them to believe his death was suicide. However, later reports suggested that his death was accidental, the result of autoerotic asphyxiation.

Two autopsies were conducted, one involving the celebrity pathologist Pornthip Rojanasunan, and both concluded that the death was not a suicide. The cause of death became widely accepted as “accidental asphyxiation.”Carradine’s lawyer Vicki Roberts went on record stating: “I believe there may have been foul play.”

Reports around the time of his death suggest that Carradine may have been involved in child sex tourism; a rampant issue in Thailand where he was found. If he was involved in pedophilia, could he have been connected to a wider network of Hollywood elite pedophiles?

Here we have the almighty “72”. If ever there was a more complete and hermetic number for ritual work this is it. Of course, what better way throw collective common sense out the window than to write a sex scandal into the narrative. “Death by erotic asphyxiation.” I’m calling Bullshit on that. Was Carradine into the Pedo scene? It sure seems like there are more than a few connections. Unlike other people on this list he wasn’t in the process of attempting to out anyone at the time of his death.

The first of 3 fashion designers on this list, McQueen was found in the AM, hanging from a doorknob by his housekeeper at his home in Green Street, London where paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene. Metropolitan Police stated that the note McQueen left was not suspicious, however, they did not confirm that his death was a suicide.

Photos of McQueen’s fashion shows. It’s obvious that McQueen was in the thick of it and made a regular habit of signaling his allegiance. As an occultist I can tell you that the attention to detial and themes portraid in his shows were beyond that of casual decor. They ran deep.

Tech pioneer, and Reddit co-founder, Aaron Swartz was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment by his partner, Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman. A spokeswoman for New York’s Medical Examiner reported that he had hanged himself from a doorknob. No suicide note was found.

According to former-CIA agent Robert Steele, Swartz hacked into MIT Computers and found a huge stash of Child Pornography shortly before his death.

Another numerologically significant date. Jan, 11th is “1/11” and this number has a few meanings. first, 111 is 3 “1’s” or 3. Master Mason is the 3rd degree. It is also the first 11 of the year. 11 symbolizes the pillars of Boaz and Jachin which sat at the entrance to King Solomon’s Temple. 11 is also the first number after “10” which is the most perfect number and represents ILLUMINATION.” “11” represents imperfection in government because it is one number short of 12, which symbolizes a perfect theocratic government. Satanists love to utilize this dystopian number in their ritual work. Of course, the triple and quadruple “1’s” holds extreme significance in pop culture as a number everyone seems to notice regularly.

At first the numerology surrounding this murder seems a little overkill, no pun intended. 11 is quite a powerful and significant number to utilize when weaving into a ritual. But upon a closer examination of Aaron’s life, we realize that his death was most certainly to be used as an example to other budding guienses. Although Aaron no doubt more than likely had incriminating files of the elite pertaining to pedophilia he was also the spearhead of a movement to bring and maintain freedom of speech and presence on the Internet. The internet HAS replaced TV and IS the default platform for the human species at this point. Aaron posed a real threat to this.

Our second fashion designer on the list is L’Wren Scott, long time lover of Mick Jagger and (former girlfriend of Nate Rothschild) was found dead by her assistant at her apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan on March 17, 2014. The police reported that no note was found and there was no sign of foul play. The New York City Chief Medical Examiner determined Scott’s manner and cause of death to be “suicide by hanging.”

I wonder what sort information concerning the underbelly of sex, privilage, and decadance the ex girlfriend of a Rothschild and mega rockstar would be privy to which would either put her at jeopardy for elimination or make her want to kill herself? And the fact that I’m not buying the whole “death by doorknob suicide” Bullshit, I’m guessing she was silenced.

Williams died at his home in Paradise Cay, California. The initial report released on August 12, the Marin County Sheriff’s Office deputy coroner stated Williams had hanged himself after he was found hanging from a doorknob with a necktie.The final autopsy report, released in November 2014, ruled that Williams had committed suicide by hanging himself from the doorknob.Neither alcohol nor illegal drugs were involved, while all prescription drugs present in his body were at “therapeutic” levels, the coroner declared.

Williams had been a part of the Hollywood scene for so long, nearly anything one can imagine could possibly be true. There’s a 100% chance Williams rubbed elbows with everyone in the Hollywood scene at one time or another and was exposed to everything Hollywood had to offer. The question is: How deep was he into the scene? Decades of cocaine and partying can lead to some pretty dark places. He most certainly knew the dirty secrets of Henry Weinstein and his ilk, but what most people forget is that these celebreties cross over into politics quite often and support the agendas of democrat canidates regularly. This is where we get into “brownstonin.”

Hollywook insider and whistleblower Jon Robberson has chimed in on the Hollywood pedophile sex rings. He recently madestatements in an interview regarding his belief that Robin Williams was most likely blackmailed into making the film Patch Adams.

And would do we make the Family Guy predictive programming which transpired shortly before Robin’s death? It’s obvious that Seth McFarlane has a hand in the mechanics of these rituals.

Cornell was found unconscious by his bodyguard, hanging from the doorknob in the bathroom of his hotel room at the MGM Grand in Detroit, after performing at a show with Soundgarden at the Fox Theatre on May 17. He was lying on the floor with an exercise band around his neck and blood in his mouth. An MGM medic and EMS personnel were unable to revive Cornell. Cornell was pronounced dead by a doctor at 1:30 a.m. Police ruled out homicide by reviewing a hotel surveillance video, which showed nobody entering or exiting the suite after his bodyguard left at around 11:35 p.m. The cause of death was determined to be “suicide by hanging.”

Cornell’s death is surrounded by rumors that he was about to expose key players in the DC pedophile ring known as pizza gate. It’s no secret that Cornell and Chester Bennington, (Next on this list) died two months later the exact same way, had begun an organization to help at-risk children. Chester Bennington as you will learn is the son of John Podesta. You can’t make this stuff up.

Several have questioned what they say are gaps in the timeline. The police report says the bodyguard was in Cornell’s hotel room at 11:30 p.m. to help the star with the victim’s “computer, which was not working at that time.” It says Vicky Cornell talked to her husband at 11:35 p.m., and, alarmed by what she heard, she phoned the bodyguard to ask him to check on her husband. He told police he went to Cornell’s room at 12:15 a.m. Some question the apparent 40-minute gap between the start of Vicky’s conversation with her husband and the bodyguard’s welfare check at his room.

Assistant Wayne County Medical Examiner Theodore Brown said that upon a visual examination, “no pills were found in the stomach,” according to his report. But there’s no indication in the toxicology report that Cornell’s stomach was tested to determine the level of drugs there, since only the blood sample is cited. Cornell also had nine broken ribs discovered at his autopsy. The official explanation was that the medics broke his ribs trying to resuscitate him using CPR. An indepth article on the investigation can be found here.

Linkin Park’s Chester Bennington was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California; his housekeeper discovered his body hanging from a doorknob around 9:00 a.m. His death was officially ruled as suicide.

On July 21, Brian Elias, the chief of operations for the office of the medical examiner-coroner, confirmed that a half-empty bottle of alcohol was found at the scene, but no other drugs were present. Believing himself to be a victim of child abuse, Chester Bennington was working with his best friend Cornell to expose a high-reaching child trafficking network.

But to say that Bennington believed himself to be a victim of child abuse is like stating that Adolf Hitler was simply a charismatic politician. Good lord this rabbit hole runs deep. The band’s logo was a broken version of the triangle used in pedophile networks. There is no doubt that Bennington’s entire existence was consumed by the ritualistic sexual abuse he sustained at the hands of his father John Podesta.

What are the odds that two best friends who are about to expose a DC pedophile ring of which one of the friend’s father was at the heart of died in the exact same bizarre manner and that the second want to die did so two months later on his best friend’s birthday?

There is no doubt that Bennington would’ve struck at the heart of this DC pedophile ring more than likely bringing down Podesta, Hillary Clinton and their networks. After all he had the DNA to corroborate his claim. I don’t think Bennington knew just how much danger he was in.

Swedish DJ Avicii, real name Tim Bergling, died on 20 April 2018 near Muscat, Oman, at the age of 28. No cause of death was immediately given. On 21 April, the Omani police stated that there was “no criminal suspicion” or evidence of foul play in Bergling’s death. On 26 April, his family released an open letter stating that Bergling “really struggled with thoughts about meaning, life, happiness. He could not go on any longer.” On 1 May, TMZ reported that the cause of death was a suicide due to self-inflicted injuries. Although full details of his death were not released, TMZ reports that he suffered cuts from broken glass along with neck injuries. Although it is unclear what the injuries to his neck were, it could have been caused by asphyxiation and hanging has not been ruled out. After his death, it emerged that Avicii was working to expose an elite pedophile ring. One of his videos began to recirculate in which he attempts to expose child trafficking.

In 2015 Avicii did release a video for his song “For a Better Day” where he shows child sex tracking taking place and two girls that escape from a man trying to capture them. The video later reveals that the two girls seek revenge on the ‘elite’ that were running this pedophile operation

Did Avicii have the clout and influence to help wake up an entire generation to the horrors of institutionalized and ritualistic pedophilia and our global governments and institutions? Or was he simply ritual fodder?

Our third fashion designer on this list is Kate Spade. Also linked to the Clintons Spade was found dead hanging by the neck from a doorknob in her Manhattan apartment. It is been said that “buying a Kate Spade handbag was a coming-of-age ritual for a generation of American women.” It’s obvious that’s not the only ritual going on here.

A note found at the scene was addressed in the Spade’s 13-year-old daughter indicating that what happened was not the child’s fault. Miss Spade’s entrance into the dark world of privilege and decadence was when she met her husband to be, the brother of actor and comedian David Spade.

According to a Clinton Foundation DOCUMENT, Kate Spade was among a group that traveled to Haiti on behalf of the Clinton Foundation. She was part of the foundation’s initiative to foster “economic growth, support small businesses, and empower girls and women.”

There’s no doubt that Spade, who seems like a generally good person came across the same information regarding the Clinton foundation Haitian child sex trafficking network that got Monica Peterson killed by the Clintons.

Most believe that Klaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official was also “SUICIDED” in his Miami motel one day prior to testifying in court. Eberwein was scheduled to appear Tuesday before the Haitian Senate’s Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. No doubt the topic of child sex trafficking and the Clintons was on the agenda. As a side note. Klaus was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti, Muncheez, and has a pizza — the Klaus Special — named after him.

Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of Bill and Hillary Clinton, paid tribute to the fashion designer via Twitter. “My grandmother gave me my first Kate Spade bag when I was in college. I still have it. Holding Kate’s family, friends and loved ones in my heart.”

Equally as strange as Kate Spade hanging herself with a red scarf from a doorknob was the reaction of her husband shortly after the incident. Two days after Kate hanged herself from a doorknob with a red scarf Andy Spade was videotaped walking around in public wearing a mouse mask with a red scarf and newspaper hat. It was actually the mask of one of the characters from the classic Disney cartoon The Avengers. This is some strange behavior which doesn’t fit into any box. Who the hell just happens to have an Avengers mouse mask laying around the house? NO!!!

In my opinion, this was a public self-humiliation ritual. A nod, a message, a signaling of subservience to the Clintons or whoever had Kate killed that he understands and will be playing ball.

Do we even need to mention she was killed at 33? Dutch Queen Maxima’s sister Ines Zorreguieta (The only royalty on this list) was found dead in Argentina last week. Zorreguieta, 33, was found dead by a friend who discovered her body hanging from a doorknob in her apartment in the Almagro district of Buenos Aires. Police said the autopsy report would be available in a week but did not suspect foul play.

According to reports, Zorreguieta was connected to high-level elites involved in child trafficking. Queen Maxima stepped down after allegations of her involvement in “hunts” where children were raped and massacred by her dinner guests. Some speculators believe she may have been “silenced” before she could go public about a cabal-connected pedophile ring.

European royalty, especially the Dutch have a long history of being accused of not only engaging in pedophilia but hunting killing and eating children. If you’re a normie this may seem shocking, but for those of us in the trenches this information is not new. David Icke has been screaming from the rooftops about this for over three decades and it’s just now starting to get attention. Do your research, then share.

At the height of his career, chef, TV personality, world traveler and armchair philosopher Anthony Bourdain decided to commit suicide by hanging himself from a doorknob. Because apparently that’s just what you do when you’re successful and have a great life.

Just prior to being “SUICIDED” Bourdain tweeted :

“know what Hillary Clinton is NOT? She’s not stupid. Or unsophisticated about the world. The Weinstein stories had been out there for years.”

“Mindless Hillary hate aside, this was a terrible response to questions about a “friend” who’s been tormenting women for decades.”

“I have met Hillary Clinton. I liked her. I admired much about her. This interview was a real disappointment.”

“Hillary is CLEARLY not responsible for anyting Weinstein. Thats screamingly obvious. Her response to questions though has been uninspiring.”

“..and I am in no was an HRC fan. I’ve been on he receiving end of her operatives’ wrath. And it ain’t fun,”

“It’s no secret that people who cross the Clintons wind up dead…mostly from suicide,”

Occultic and ritualistic mechanics surrounding his death include: the show he was working on was in its 11th season. He died in France which is birthplace of the Scottish Rite within Freemasonry. Interestingly Bourdain participated in an ancient death ritual and the season finale of his TV show. parts unknown which aired two weeks after he was suicided. If this isn’t predictive programming I don’t know what is.

12. At first this seems like a good round number in which to structure a deep state sanctioned ritualistic murder spree. However, upon second glance there’s nothing arbitrary about it. It has everything to do with, wait for it, THE SUN. or The Son (Jesus) or any ancient god which was used at the time to represent the sun through stories and allegories. eg

Jesus had 12 disciples, Buddha had 12 followers, Quetzaocoatl had 12 followers, the 12 nights of the roundtable, Hercules and his 12 labors, the 12 tribes of Israel, the 12 great patriarchs, 12 Old Testament prophets, 12 jewels of the high priest. And it goes on and on.
• 12 years of childhood before the “teens

Christianity and Astrotheology aside, these deaths and the fact that they were for further molded, packaged and deployed as 12 is taken full advantage of the resonance and occultic meaning behind this number as it relates to conscripting of these energies for use in ritual magick. Only in this case is a BLACK SUN RITUAL as this is overly perverted black magick.

In his masterpiece, Secret Teachings of All Ages Manly P Hall writes this:

The number twelve frequently occurs among ancient peoples, who in nearly every case had a pantheon consisting of twelve demigods and goddesses presided over by The Invincible One, who was Himself subject to the Incomprehensible All-Father. This use of the number twelve is especially noted in the Jewish and Christian writings. The twelve prophets, the twelve patriarchs, the twelve tribes, and the twelve Apostles–each group has a certain occult significance, for each refers to the Divine Duodecimo, or Twelvefold Deity, whose emanations are manifested in the tangible created Universe through twelve individualized channels.

“The number 12 was celebrated as a mystical number in the ancient systems of sun-worship, of which It has already been said that Masonry Is a philosophical development. The number there referred to the twelve signs of the zodiac, and in those Masonic rites in which the Builder Is made the symbol of the sun, the twelve Fellow Crafts refer to the twelve signs in which alone the sun is to be sought for.”

Gnostic teachings tell us that there is only one true Square number. 144. or 12 X 12= 144 which is pure math harmony both vertically and horizontally. This can easily be seen in music, but also affects our DNA and how we react to “vibrations.” REMEMBER physical acts are simply the vibrational manifestation of thought process in our three-dimensional world. Our brain is nothing more than a 3 to 4th dimensional interface machine. Ergo…. Practitioners of this magick understand that physical acts will have a bearing on the mind going the other way as well. Especially when it enacted in traumatic fashion and designed to resonate with natural energies. OR ritualistic magic.

But who is the 13th?

This should be obvious at this point. The 13th, is the SUN, GOD, or he who places himself in the stead of the Sun, Son, God, Sun-God. Jesus and Buddha were obviously the 13th. King Arthur was the 13th. God was the 13th in regards to the patriarchs. The sun is the 13th after the 12 constellations in the zodiac. And on and on.

Of course, this has an obvious association with Lucifer (bringer of light) who “wanted to be like the most-high.” What’s more, this behavior is represented throughout all religion and astrology and is always associated with the fall or destruction of man. or PRIDE. Lucifers sin.

There is a right and a wrong way to go about living and seeking knowledge. The first is to live in harmony with our world and its laws and energies as it has been laid out for us. Recognizing that the Sun is the giver of life / our Creator. The other involves the attempt to place oneself in the position of the Sun and through cleverness, back engineer these natural laws and bend them to one’s own will. For Christians, Lucifer, the bringer of light or the bringer of knowledge, is representative of this second path. He represents the black 13

This ritual is a simple inversion of the sacred 12 and one. A perversion of the natural energies of creation. Instead of the one, the source, the Sun giving life; it is extinguishing it. And not only this, but extinguishing it utilizing the 12 which normally keep it in balance.

This entire protracted ritual involving 12 murders served two purposes simultaneously. Two purposes interconnected and equally vile. Dark hermetic magick that when carried out successfully multiplies the effectiveness of evil.

The first, to silence those who would uncover the pedophilia the corruption the true nature of the political and Hollywood elite who feed on children. And when I say feed I mean feed completely. Energetically, sexually, and physically. These monsters have been consuming children for over 1000 years and their institutions are the same institutions which are in place today. These murders were meant to keep a lid on everything.

Second. The sacrifice. Is in accordance with the laws of the universe the debt must always be paid. This is not only the philosophical reason for sacrifice but the explanation of the physics behind it. The energies involved mandate that something must be sacrificed if something else is to be given. In this case, whistleblowers and people of the light were sacrificed. Perhaps these people were dirty and engage in pedophilia and had a change of heart or perhaps they were weak and would’ve caved under pressure are perhaps they were victims themselves. It matters not.

Why a Doorknob? The Meaning Behind the Metaphor

Following the death of Bourdain, Ex CIA spy and whistle-blower Robert David Steele has come out to shed some light on the rash of suicides. Steele states that all these suicides bear the hallmark of professional hit job designed to silence others in going public with damaging political information. It is a calling card, a message, a signal to others. No different than a Columbian necktie, or spiking heads on the edge of villages. It is designed to instill fear into the hearts of people and maintain their silence.

It is pretty well understood that is incredibly difficult yet not impossible to kill one’s self by committing suicide in this manner. There are other ways to go about the act both emotionally and physically. This method, along with the numerology, timing, and sheer numbers of deaths are nothing less than a public display of punishment.

Robert David Steele goes on to say that the circumstances of the deaths have a significant symbolic meaning that intelligence agencies immediately recognize.

“Hung on doorknobs means choked for speaking out against the cabal.”

These people were choked to unconsciousness and then hung on a doorknob to die alone slowly only to have their bodies used as a message upon being found.

Is it possible to hang one’s self from a doorknob.

The answer to this macabre question is a resounding YES. With a few keystrokes, one can find an entire website dedicated to explaining in detail how to accomplish this, along with every other conceivable method of ending one’s life. From the website:

Whilst generally the literature considers asphyxiation via constriction of the airway as the main cause of death in short drop hanging, Stone does discuss how short drop hanging can take place without the pain and discomfort of the airway being blocked. The idea is to have enough pressure from the noose on the right side of the head, just below the jaw, to constrict the carotid artery. Interrupting the blood flow to the brain causes swift unconsciousness (in 15 seconds or less), then what should be death in five to ten minutes.

Likewise, death can also be achieved by constricting the jugular vein under the left side of the jaw, which prevents blood from getting back to the heart.

Apparently, one of two methods is used for a legitimate doorknob hanging suicide. The first, tie the rope, scarf or elastic gym equipment to the doorknob and run it over the top of the door giving yourself enough room to dangle. The second. Tie the rope to the doorknob and then to the neck and sit down until you choke yourself unconscious. At which point one would die without pain or terror. The problem is, human survival instinct ALWAYS kicks and people fight for air to stay alive. It’s the body which fights to stay alive, not the person. That is unless they are drugged or unable to do so. This is why it is strange that so many of the above suicides didn’t involve any drugs.

Years ago I had a friend whose adult son drowned himself in their above ground pool. I and a friend were the first to arrive and pull his body from the pool. This hadn’t been his first attempt at drowning himself and he’d been quite open in the past while talking about his fail attempts. This time, however, he managed to pin himself between the side of the pool and the metal stairs before exhaling to prevent himself from surfacing.

Have people hung themselves by doorknobs in the past? Apparently, they have. Do I believe that 12 celebrities connected to both the Clintons’ and pedophilia in one way or another all decided to hang themselves from doorknobs right in the middle of a DC pedophile ring scandal (Pizzagate) just prior to the implosion of Weinstein and the #METOO movement? Hell no, I don’t.",conspiracy,C06ca8,cia.cocaine; pizzagate
462,"Residents in a Washington DC neighborhood are upset over fliers claiming the completely debunked and utterly bizarre 'pizzagate' conspiracy theory is real.

The fliers appeared in the Tenleytown neighborhood where a man fired a gun inside the Comet Ping Pong restaurant, which was at the center of the strange and false conspiracy.

At least one resident who received a flier called police. The shooting is still fresh in the community's consciousness, as it happened just six months ago.

Edgar Welch, 29, said he wanted to investigate the wild online claims of a child sex ring at Comet Ping Pong. The North Carolina man was sentenced to four years in prison in late June for opening fire into the restaurant in order to save children he believed were being trafficked.

The fliers were placed on fences and doors and called for the conspiracy theory to be re-investigated. Residents said they were feeling 'rage, anger and disgust' that the theory is still being circulated.

'The intel on this wasn't 100 percent,' Welch said after his arrest. Given the still-recent violence, neighbors were alarmed by the fliers, which read 'pizzagate is real news and it is your moral obligation to educate yourself about it!'

'I'm all for free speech but I think this goes beyond free speech into issues of public safety,' said Craig Williams who received one of the fliers to local NBC 4.

At Welch's sentencing, the judge said that even though Welch didn't harm anyone, his unsound actions 'literally left psychological wreckage.'

The fliers turned up sometime between Wednesday night and Thursday morning.

The 'Pizza-gate' theory claimed Hillary Clinton and her campaign chief John Podesta ran a child sex trafficking ring out of Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in DC. The theory emerged after Podesta's emails were released in a WikiLeaks hack.

The pizza shops owner James Alefantis was mentioned in the emails as he is a democratic supporter and his shop was under consideration as a venue for a campaign fundraiser.

The speculation began when discussions of cheese pizza were theorized to be code words for child porn as they share the same initials.

The disturbing and voraciously debunked claims were then propagated by far right radio show host and blogger Alex Jones.

Jones eventually issued an apology for supporting the theory after Welch opened fire at Comet Ping Pong. Welch said he went to the restaurant in an attempt to save trafficked children that he believed were being hidden there.

Jones' apology statement read 'Neither Mr. Alefantis, nor his restaurant Comet Ping Pong, were involved in any human trafficking as was part of the theories about Pizzagate that were being written about in many media outlets and which we commented upon.'

The judge during Welch's sentencing said Welch 'forged ahead' with an 'ill-conceived plot' even though others urged him to abandon it. She added that Welch should have notified law enforcement if he really believed children were being harmed.

Two Comet Ping Pong workers and owner James Alefantis also spoke before Welch's sentencing. Alefantis called 'pizzagate' a 'viscous web of lies' and said many people had suffered because of Welch's actions.

Welch, a father of two, drove 300-some miles from North Carolina to Washington DC to personally investigate the conspiracy theory and rescue potential sex slaves.

Patrons at the restaurant fled when they saw Welch, who was armed with a fully loaded AR-15 assault rifle and revolver. He opened fire at a locked storage closet. Thankfully no one was injured.

In his one-page, handwritten letter filed with the court earlier in June, Welch wrote that he 'came to DC with the intent of helping people I believed were in dire need of assistance, and to bring an end to a corruption that I truly felt was harming innocent lives'.

He wrote that he wanted to apologize and that he acted without considering the repercussions of his actions or the possible harm.

'It was never my intention to harm or frighten innocent lives, but I realize now just how foolish and reckless my decision was,' he wrote.

Comet Ping Pong owner James Alefantis has said the 'pizzagate' hoax that spread on the internet threw the lives of everyone connected with the shop into chaos.

Prosecutors Demian Ahn and Sonali Patel wrote that a 'significant sentence' of 4.5 years was required not only to punish Welch but to 'deter other would-be vigilantes from attempting similar crimes against innocent subjects of the next internet-inspired conspiracy theory'.",mainstream,M1c34e,pizzagate
1022,"The New York Times Makes Another Attempt to Normalize Pedophilia

We should begin with the 2014 opinion piece published by the NYT that, shockingly, few are familiar with. That article is entitled, “Pedophilia: A Disorder, Not a Crime.” It begins, “THINK back to your first childhood crush. Maybe it was a classmate or a friend next door..” doing their best to associate this sickening practice with our first feelings of love, otherwise implying that it is natural, if not normal.

In what can only be seen as shameless pandering to those behind the scenes, the article goes on from there to make the assertion that pedophiles are neither responsible for the crimes they commit, nor do they have the ability to stop themselves, effectively relieving these damaged individuals of all culpability and accountability for their actions. The author goes as far as to label the crime a “disability,” with potential discrimination thereof. The writer makes the claim that the laws currently in place in the US are, “inconsistent and irrational,” and argues that these child molesters should be sent for treatment, as opposed to serving prison time for their heinous acts against the most defenseless of us all. This is despite the overwhelming numbers that show just how often these “victims of impulse,” as the writer is trying to frame them, are “victims” of recidivism; the tendency of a convicted criminal to re-offend.

According to Harvard Medical School, estimates of recidivism among sexual offenders vary because studies define this term in different ways. One such Harvard review found recidivism rates as high as 50% among pedophiles.

One may be thinking, this is exactly why these troubled individuals need treatment, as the author suggests. No one can argue that one with such sickening desires does not need treatment, as that seems to be a foregone conclusion. However, the issue in question is whether or not that treatment actually works, and most importantly, whether or not treatment can be, or should be, used in place of a correctional facility, as the author dangerously advocates. A 2004 study published in the International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology, which included 109 convicted sex offenders who completed therapy and 37 who dropped out, showed that the “non-completers,” were in fact more likely to commit another sexual crime.

The point being, that treatment does work to a certain degree and is important, as many can attest to, but not in place of a correctional facility when considering violent sexual criminals — and for one very clear reason. Researchers of the study noted that sex offenders who completed the therapy were not any more likely to show empathy toward their past victims.

This, in the opinion of some, shows a willingness to complete the therapy so as to move past it, but not with the intention to get better. The lack of empathy is a very important note, as the researchers documented, as it shows a lack of remorse. How can one feel that treatment for such a horrendous crime is effective if the perpetrator never shows any remorse for the acts they committed? The running theme throughout the article is that those who engage in pedophilia, should not be treated as criminals, but as victims themselves, despite the fact that potentially half of them will victimize another child in the near future, and even those who complete the treatment were no more likely so show remorse for those they abused.

One could come to all kinds of conclusions about why this article was written, and what the intentions truly were, but at the end of the day, it could be chalked up to any number of agendas or personal experiences, on its own.

The next aspect to consider, was the abysmally bad coverage by the New York Times, of all the surrounding events and criminal acts in regard to the investigation that became known as “Pizzagate.” Now to be clear, you must do away with visions of Hillary Clinton in a pizza parlor basement with kids chained to the walls. As I do not doubt that these sinister individuals would do, or have done just that, in the case of this investigation, those bullet points are being used to discredit and distract from the larger truth behind the scenes, and were likely thrown out when researchers began to get a bit too close, as with the case of Laura Silsby.

On numerous occasions while “covering” the Pizzagate investigation, the New York Times editorial staff took it upon themselves to ignore their charge as journalists to hold those in power accountable, and instead chose to completely omit the evidence at hand, in order to pander to the very individuals under scrutiny for pedophilia. And the few articles the failing organization did choose to put out on the topic were shockingly devoid of any critical analysis of the information, while inserting their own feelingsabout the case, and “conspiracy theorists” as a whole. That is not journalism, its propaganda.

There is far too much information surrounding this case to rehash it all in a single article (for those interested, TLAV has done extensive research into the case, as have many others such as Titus Frost), yet it is not hard to see, even with a cursory glance, that there is truth to these claims backed up by some pretty damning evidence, as many are beginning to see.



 Which brings us to a recent NYT piece entitled, “Why I Admire Anthony Weiner;” and yes, it was written after Weiner was arrested and sentenced to prison for acts of pedophilia. This one speaks for itself. And there is no hidden meaning, no metaphor to be had — as if that would make it any better, should the writer have some grand conclusion and explanation for why she is openly admiring a convicted pedophile. The writer is simply making the case for why she admires his conduct during his trial, for which he was being held accountable, and rightly so, for his illegal actions with a 15-year-old girl. In essence, the author is saying that Weiner chose to take the high road, in accepting that he was responsible for his crime instead of blaming the disease, as many often do. Yet this is a blatant attempt to minimize the negative press of both Weiner and the Democratic party. Despite him no longer holding a position, it still reflects very badly on the party, which is why they went to their knee-jerk political propaganda arm, The New York Times, to pump out a fluff piece.

In astonishingly oblivious fashion, the writer ignores the years of lies and manipulation that preceded Weiner’s display of what can only be seen as regret for being caught, as opposed to actual remorse. How can it be admirable to sexually abuse an underage girl, lie about it for years, allow Hillary Clinton to cover it up for you, wait until they have you dead to rights, still deny the charges, then sobbingly admit to them in court when confronted with the overwhelming evidence? That’s easy, it’s not.

What we are witnessing here is what amounts to the acceptance and normalization of child abuse by the New York Times, in order to cover for some much larger issue at play. God only knows what those are… (well, and the independent media)

How The “Conspiracy Theory” Label Was Conceived To Derail The Truth Movement

How Covert American Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate, Deceive, and Destroy Reputations

[Critical Notice: Unlike in Europe, especially France, where Freemasons forces are known and feared, in American today this nations citizens have absolutely no idea of this historic war going on all around them—but that cannot be said of their ancestors; who in 1828 formed the Anti-Masonic Party to stop them from taking power, but whom, just a year later, in 1829, were totally defeated by Freemason forces loyal to America’s First Grand-Master President Andrew Jackson—and whose portrait Freemason leader President Trump ordered immediately installed in the White House Oval Office upon his taking power. Therefore, in order to understand this report, all of the previous reports (listed and linked below) must be read (and links followed) to know what is now occurring, and is being deliberately hidden from you.]

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

Another stunning Security Council (SC) report on the escalating war between “Shadow Government” globalists and Freemason leader President Donald Trump circulating in the Kremlin today states that President Putin’s fearful order for the Federation military to be prepared to “launch attacks at any minute”, and his further ordering the rapid redeployment of strategic long range nuclear bombers, was due to Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu being told by his South Korean and Japanese counterparts that US Secretary of Defense General James “Mad Dog/Warrior Monk” Mattis (who had just visited these Asian nations) had revealed to them that a massive plot had been discovered where China would conduct a massive Pearl Harbor type attack on the United States, and then shortly afterwards, begin an occupation in defense of the “new nation” of California. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]

According to this report, Security Council analysts have previously determined that the Freemason forces being led by President Trump are intent on uniting the United States with Russia in order to destroy China so they can reestablish a “new world order”—and exactly as they had done during their last “emergence” in the late 17th and early 18th Centuries when they destroyed the power of European monarchies and Catholic Church through both the American and French revolutions.

With China having wiped out about a quarter of its world’s largest foreign-currency stockpile over the past 18 months in order to keep its currency stable, and that Trump is now using to drive a wedge between the Russians and Chinese, this report continues, Beijing in their knowing of Trump’s coming victory in the 8 November US presidential election, and in seeking to halt Freemason forces from reaching their objective, began the takeover of the top 6 major Hollywood studios.

China’s strategic initiative in taking over these Hollywood studios, this report explains, was to form an alliance with the radical leftists controlling this powerful industry, and who, in turn, have now announced that they are forming an alliance to destroy Freemason leader President Trump—and who have already begun marshalling their forces to ferment chaos and rebellion throughout the United States.

Most critical to note of this China-Hollywood alliance, however, this report says, are that many numbers of American radical-leftist actors, actresses, singing artists, directors, producers, etc., are now being employed as couriers shuttling messages between Beijing and their Democratic Party communistic allies through, at least, 13 corporations owned by Wang Jianlin, China's richest man—and in order to escape “normal/common” US military electronic detection measures.

Also to note, this report continues, are intercepted encrypted communications between the Independent Republic of California Embassy in Moscow and Beijing showing that hundreds of top Chinese military and political “subversive operatives” have begun mass purchases of homes and buildings in Seattle, Washington in order to further their occupation efforts of Western America once war begins.

As the Federal Security Service (FSB) had previously reported (December, 2016) of their estimation that Hillary Clinton would become the governor of California in 2018, with succession of this State from the United States occurring in 2019, this report warns, Freemason forces under the command of President Trump are moving against his “Shadow Government” enemies faster than anyone anticipated, thus making this timeline appear to be much closer.

In their support of the analysis that this timeline has shrunk, Security Council analysts in this report explain, is evident in many radical communistic revolutionary examples now occurring in America that include: California now pushing for their schools to mandate lessons teaching students about Russia’s “hacking” of the 2016 presidential election, University of California Professor Darrell Hamamoto trumpeting how the UC Berkeley riots are part of the radical leftist plan to destroy freedom of speech, and the Pope Francis Vatican led faction of the “Shadow Government” having Dr. David Parry, of their “satanic” Jesuit Saint Joseph’s University, now shockingly telling students that they “don’t have to open their hearts” to white Trump supporters—thus making it is right to kill them all.

As to how these Vatican-“Shadow Government” globalist elites have been able to subvert and corrupt the minds of their various nation’s young citizens, this report further details, is revealed in many shocking examples too: including: in Berlin where it was found that nearly all of these leftist radicals were unemployed and living at home with their parents, and even more shockingly in America were new evidenced has emerged showing that over 25% of the students entering into university are immediately diagnosed with mental illness for having any anti-leftist views and then given powerful mind drugs.

Among the perpetrators destroying the minds of these millions of American university students, this report continues, is the feared “Shadow Government” University of California political operative David Brock [and homosexual “boy love” advocate embroiled in the “Pizzagate” scandal] who was just given full control of Democratic Party—and whose staggering plan to destroy Freemason leader President Trump that was just secretly revealed (Democracy Matters: Strategic Plan for Action) outlines initial measures to challenge [in leftist-leaning US Federal Courts] every thing Trump does, conspires with Google and Facebook to shut down and destroy all conservative media sources, and that then plans for the violent destruction of America through mass street riots and chaos.

To the success of David Brock’s “Strategic Plan for Action” against Freemason leader President Trump, this report details, is undeniable as one radical leftist US Federal Court is blocking Trump’s trying to keep Islamic radicals out of America, and another is, likewise, blocking his actions to eliminate hundreds-of-thousands of federal regulations.

With the needless federal regulations Freemason leader President Trump is trying to eliminate costing the America taxpayers a staggering $1.9 trillion a year, and new reports showing that 36,007 criminal aliens were released by the Obama regime from custody in 2013 alone—1,000 of whom had already been convicted of new crimes as of June 2015, including 121 murders—this report continues, one need only wonder when Trump’s patience will run out.

And when it does, this report warns, Minister of Defence Shoigu, in his relating to President Putin his conversations with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts, states that US Defense Secretary General Mattis revealed that Freemason leader President Trump was in the initial stages of preparing to unleash upon all of his Vatican-“Shadow Government”-Radical Leftist enemies the most fearsome force in the world today—The United States Militia.

Known to but a handful of military experts, this report explains, Freemason leader President Trump has the power to invoke at any time he so chooses the Militia Act of 1903—and that upon his doing so, every able-bodied man of at least 17 and under 45 years of age in America will become part of what is known as the Unorganized Militia under his direct, and sole, command—and that will include the estimated 55 million of these people who are already heavily armed with 265 million guns—includes 16 million hunters who will covert to guerilla fighters, along with 21.8 million veterans of the US armed forces who overwhelmingly support Trump.

Not being understood by nearly all of these radical leftist and globalist elite enemies of Trump, who constantly compare him Nazi Germany’s Adolph Hitler, yet are still unable to comprehend the staggering military power within his grasp, this report grimly explains, is that the only historical counterpart that he can be compared to is Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte—who as a “secret” Freemason not only participated as one of the masterminds of the French Revolution, but was, also, able to mobilize one of the largest armies ever known—an historical fact not known in America today, but, most assuredly, remembered in the Italian village of Vagli Sotto, whose present day inhabitants in this region of Tuscany still remember when Bonaparte led a French division south to invade their region and occupy Tuscany and the Papal States—and explains why today they are erecting a giant marble statute to honour Freemason leader President Trump in their hoping to be spared from his wrath.

In concluding their report, Security Council analysts note that it’s important to remember that these Freemasons are never subtle when it comes to their cryptic warnings either—and who, in 2014, warned these “pampered monsters” in their “high satanic citadel” of New York City of what was soon to come by flooding this city with advertisement posters just simply saying: “The French Aristocracy Never Saw it Coming Either”—and with Freemason leader President Trump able to reach within minutes 87 million of his most loyal supporters, the “cannon fodder” masses of these leftist global elites won’t know what hit them—but that cannot be said of their so called radical leaders who are building and fleeing to their bunkers as fast as they can.

From our 21 January report that we believe is worth your remembering:

[Special Message from Sister Saoirse: Though age has dimmed my eyesight, it has not affected my mind, and as a young 18-year-old year novice in 1936, I remember well my distributing our Sorcha Faal pamphlets in my small German village of Remagen warning of the strange and satanic rituals being performed by many of our military and political leaders. No one would believe such outlandish things as they were impossible to imagine, just like this report is, and the others below are too. So please let me advise you that just because a thing is too astonishing to believe, it does not make it untrue. My country learned this lesson much too late, yours doesn’t have to.]

[Critical Notice: Recent reports are showing that the satanic Nazi occult rituals referenced by Sister Saoirse in her 21 January message have now been revived within the German military forces.]

Final Battle For The World Begins: But Will Trumpian Forces Unite?

America Goes Insane As It Rushes Towards Civil War",conspiracy,C008ea,cia.cocaine; pizzagate
532,"hile Facebook and Twitter are reportedly still waiting for their invites, President Donald Trump has invited a cartoonist accused of creating “a blatantly anti-Semitic” illustration to a Social Media Summit at the White House.

Artist Ben Garrison, whose work often display alt-right themes and is a favorite of the popular pro-Trump Reddit community The_Donald, tweeted a picture Friday of his invitation to the White House for the summit the following week.

“Honored to be invited to the White House!” wrote the Garrison on Friday. “Thank you, Mr. President!”

Garrison, known for conspiracy-minded alt-right cartoons, created an illustration in 2017 that was slammed by the Anti-Defamation League for anti-Semitic imagery. It was apparently commissioned for a website created by radio host Mike Cernovich. Cernovich promoted the bizarre “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory, which eventually led to a North Carolina man firing an assault rifle in a D.C. area pizza parlor.

Garrison’s 2017 cartoon depicted then-U.S. National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster and retired General David Petraeus being controlled by strings held by philanthropist George Soros. Soros, himself Jewish, is suspended from strings held by a hand labeled “Rothschilds,” an American banking family long subject to anti-Jewish conspiracy theories.

“The thrust of the cartoon is clear,” explained the ADL in 2017. “McMaster is merely a puppet of a Jewish conspiracy.”

Garrison’s website defends the cartoonist, saying, “Ben Garrison is neither racist nor anti-Semitic.”

President Trump, who has accused social media giants of anti-conservative bias, announced the Social Media Summit in late June. While Garrison was invited to the summit, sources told CNN that Facebook and Twitter were not. The summit will be held July 11.

In May, the White House opened an online tool asking users to share their alleged stories of social media bias directly with the President.",mainstream,M0e43b,pizzagate
723,"“We will continue to evaluate reports we receive regarding other accounts potentially associated with @realalexjones or @infowars and will take action if content that violates our rules is reported or if other accounts are utilized in an attempt to circumvent their ban,” the company wrote.

Twitter’s enforcement actions have always been opaque, and it’s easy to be skeptical of the motivations behind this one. After all, Twitter’s move came after years of Jones using his platform to propagate conspiracy theories about Sandy Hook, Pizzagate, undocumented immigrants, the media, and more—but only weeks after virtually every other major platform took action against him, and a single day after Jones very publicly disrupted hearings attended by Dorsey.

But still: This a definitive stance after years of inaction and half-measures by a company that has long prided itself on being “the free-speech wing of the free-speech party.” It’s an inescapable restriction on a figure who has become adept at toeing the line of what’s allowed while leveraging the platform to spread racist and dangerous views.

What does banning Alex Jones mean for online speech?

And maybe it’ll work. After previously claiming that bans from Twitter and Facebook would only make him “stronger,” Jones saw traffic to his website plunge after the bans took effect, a sign many have taken to mean that de-platforming extremists is an effective solution for curbing their influence. Twitter is a particularly valuable platform for Jones because it allows—allowed—him access to the mainstream media, and to new customers for the web store that makes up a great deal of his revenue.

In 2016, the far-right provocateur and former Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos was permanently banned from Twitter after waging a harassment campaign against the actress Leslie Jones. Last October, the former Trump adviser Roger Stone received a ban from Twitter for harassing and threatening several CNN anchors and commentators. In November, Twitter banned Tim Gionet, a far-right former BuzzFeed employee who went by the username @BakedAlaska, for making repeated threats and racist comments. As the New Statesman noted last month, Google searches for Gionet’s name dropped significantly after he was banned from Twitter. Alex Jones is a bigger public figure than Gionet ever was, but he’s now lost his last remaining mainstream platform. It’s a step.",mainstream,M0fda4,pizzagate
63,"Investigators in Sri Lanka have revised the death toll from the Easter Sunday atrocities to ""around"" 253 - more than 100 less than originally estimated.

It was previously thought 359 had died in the explosions.

Anil Jasinghe, the director general of Sri Lanka's health services, told Reuters: ""It could be 250 or 260. I can't exactly say. There are so many body parts and it is difficult to give a precise figure.""

Ruwan Wijewardene, Sri Lanka's deputy defence minister whose ministry is responsible for the island's police force, said the death toll had been revised down to 253 due to inaccurate figures provided by the country's morgues.

""Unfortunately the health ministry provided the earlier number to us,"" he said.

The Foreign Office has changed its Sri Lanka travel advice following the bombings, which also injured more than 500.

Eight Britons were among those killed.

The FCO is urging people not to travel, warning against all but essential travel to Sri Lanka ""due to the current evolving security situation following attacks on 21 April 2019"".

Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: “Following the horrific attacks on Easter Sunday, and the ongoing Sri Lankan security operation, I have received updated advice from the Foreign Office and decided to update the travel advice to British nationals to Sri Lanka to advise against all but essential travel.”

It comes after the US Embassy in Columbo warned that more attacks on places of worship may be coming.

In a tweet they said: ""Sri Lankan authorities are reporting that additional attacks may occur targeting places of worship.

""Avoid these areas over the weekend, starting tomorrow, April 26th through Sunday, April 28th. Continue to remain vigilant and avoid large crowds"".

331,"Kathy Griffin: 'Truth is, Roseanne has displayed herself to be a Nazi’

Kathy Griffin is never one to censor her opinions, and she has plenty of them on Roseanne Barr.

Both comedians have weathered enormous controversy this past year. Griffin was investigated by the Secret Service last summer after sharing an image of herself holding a fake bloodied head resembling President Trump. Then there's Barr, whose high-rated sitcom Roseanne was canceled by ABC last week following the star's racist tweet about black Obama aide Valerie Jarrett.

Griffin, who starts the U.S. leg of her ""Laugh Your Head Off"" tour in San Francisco next week, credits Barr for giving her a job in 1996 on Fox's short-lived sketch series Saturday Night Special, which Barr produced. She doesn't remember Barr saying anything racist back then, and believes her views were more progressive.

""I've known a lovely Roseanne,"" Griffin told USA TODAY by phone Tuesday. The last time she saw the comedian was over lunch nearly a decade ago, with Barr's then-boyfriend Johnny Argent.

MORE: Roseanne Barr promises 'restitution,' but what does that mean?

""She said, 'We're just a couple of old hippies,' "" Griffin recalled. ""And I'm like, 'Do you believe in equal rights? Because if that’s what makes you an old hippie, that’s fine. I’m in.' So not only is this not the Roseanne that I knew — I didn't see this coming at all until years later when every so often, somebody would say, 'Roseanne's tweeting crazy (expletive).' ""

Griffin doesn't believe Barr's comments should be equated with those of Full Frontal host Samantha Bee, who also landed in hot water last week after referring to Ivanka Trump as a ""feckless (female slur)"" on air. President Trump called for TBS to fire Bee, tweeting that it's ""a total double standard.""

""The talk of a double standard is all (expletive) propaganda,"" Griffin said. ""The truth is, Roseanne has displayed herself to be a Nazi. She has Nazi leanings; she retweets Nazis. She's been doing this for years. She is someone who tweets things that are conspiracy theories that lunatics then act on, like 'Pizzagate.' Sam Bee said 'feckless (expletive)' about someone who is a feckless (expletive).'

""There's a big difference between someone using the C-word and what Roseanne was doing,"" Griffin continued. ""There's a very clear delineation between Republicans who didn't like Hillary (Clinton) and people who know that by pushing certain conspiracies, it leads to acts of violence.""",mainstream,M16a26,pizzagate
1041,"Steve Huffman, the chief executive of Reddit, knows he has some explaining to do.

Huffman, also a Reddit co-founder, landed in hot water Wednesday after admitting that he used his administrative powers to secretly edit user comments that were critical of him on r/The_Donald - a popular, pro-Trump forum (or ""subreddit""). He swapped all mentions of his own username with the names of the pro-Trump group's leaders, meaning that expletive-laden posts aimed at him looked instead as if they were insulting the group's leaders.

It was not a good idea, he told The Post Friday by phone. ""I abused my power to give the bullies a hard time,"" he said. Huffman thought of his name-swapping as a joke: a way to poke back at the people who've been harassing him and some of the site's volunteer moderators for months.

It was not taken that way.

Huffman's admission fanned the flames of controversy that had been surrounding the subreddit - and its relationship with Reddit - for months. It also capped off what had already been a long week. Reddit was already warring with self-proclaimed Trump supporters after shutting down a subreddit devoted to ""pizzagate"" -- the claim that there is secret child sex-trafficking ring run by prominent Democrats. The New York Times and others have debunked this theory. The company deleted that group for revealing people's personal information.

The subreddit and its users are known for promoting conspiracy theories and fake news across Reddit, and gleefully invading and bombarding the rest of the platform with pro-Trump memes. In fact, it was so effective at flooding the site's front page with aggressive memes and posts that Reddit changed its algorithm over the summer to try to limit its reach. Nearly all of the abuse directed at Huffman, he said, came from avid posters to r/The_Donald. After Huffman's admission, many in the pro-Trump group demanded his resignation; he has not addressed those calls.

Huffman told The Post that he had been letting the abuse from the subreddit's users roll off him, but then wondered if turning the other cheek was setting a bad example. ""If The_Donald had done this to another Reddit employee, I would have banned them,"" he said.

He said he intended to swap the names for just a few hours - despite the fact that doing so violates Reddit employee policies - just to give the subreddit's moderators a taste of what he goes through on a daily basis. Then, he said, he intended to put everything back.

Still, the decision to step in and directly edit user comments was a surprising move from Huffman, who has often said Reddit's purpose is to provide a place for communities of all stripes to set up their own groups.

Reddit has struggled to address communities who regularly test the boundaries of its guidelines, or outright break them. In 2015, it introduced new anti-harassment rules and banned a handful of subreddits that regularly violated the site's guidelines - including two forums dedicated to "" fat-shaming,"" and one that existed to coordinate harassment of members of a progressive gaming site.

The bans sparked an all-out war between the company and the small but dedicated extreme subreddits - some of which had used Reddit to circulate stolen photos, among other things. Reddit's former interim CEO, Ellen Pao, resigned in the middle of that war last year; Huffman succeeded her. And since he took over, Huffman has maintained that Reddit will not interfere with users' posts, as long as they stayed within the basic guidelines.

To take a step across that line, especially for a joke, is a major departure from that philosophy.

""What he did completely destroys the credibility of Reddit,"" wrote UnimatrixZeroOne, a Reddit moderator who ""out of anger"" released screen shots of Slack conversations Thursday between Reddit moderators, admins and Huffman about the altered posts. Huffman confirmed on Friday that the images were authentic.

In those conversations, some of the site's other moderators expressed frustration with the pro-Trump subreddit and asked Huffman to ban it for repeatedly violating guidelines. One wrote that the group's members had released personally identifying information about others during the election season. That person also mentioned receiving specific threats: ""Car vandalism, pipe bomb threat (specific). Rallying calls to ruin my personal life,"" the moderator wrote.

Huffman's distaste for the group is clear, but the chats showed he does not agree with banning it outright. ""You make it seem like I don't care about figuring out t_d,"" Huffman wrote later in the chat, going on to say that ""banning it,"" as many of the moderators had asked, ""would create a mess."" (The moderators regularly abbreviate ""The_Donald"" to ""t_d"" or ""td."")

""You managed to pull a move that actually unified us with them against this mistake,"" one moderator replied.

Even Reddit users that don't support Trump have criticized Huffman. ""I can't stand the thought of Trump entering the White House, but I have to stand up to this,"" said one commenter on the site. ""It's wrong and totally unprofessional. It's going to zap any trust people have with the organization.""

Huffman said he knows what he did may set a bad precedent that could hurt users' trust in the site. But he also said, having seen this torrent of abuse first hand, that he will have Reddit step up its efforts to let users filter out negative content, and to take on the general problem of harassment.

He didn't offer a timeline for those steps. But, he promised, they will have more finesse than his ill-received attempt at a joke.

""I had my fun with them, they had their fun with me,"" he said. ""But we are not going to tolerate harassment for any others.""",mainstream,M1d625,pizzagate
1211,"Weight Watchers has announced that music producer and inspirational social media poster DJ Khaled will be its “social media ambassador” for 2018. While he may not be giving away cars to a live studio audience or have a much-shopped list of his favorite things like his fellow endorser Oprah Winfrey, the lion-obsessed hitmaker and Justin Bieber and Chance the Rapper collaborator is a natural choice for the position, as he has 3.92 million Twitter followers, boasts 8.9 million Instagram followers, and receives 3 to 4 million views per snap on his entertaining and motivating Snapchat stories.

The music producer is currently on the WW Freestyle program, a Weight Watchers initiative that launched last month featuring more “free or zero-point” foods and new “rollover points.” Khaled shared the exciting news with his mega-following in a series of Instagrams and Snapchats featuring the meals he claims to be enjoying on the WW Freestyle program.

“In full 2018 mode...excited to be living this #WWFreestyle life with you,” he captioned the first in the series of videos on Instagram. “I already Got rid of 20 pounds and ready for more. Ride with me on my journey to greatness. Bless up Weight Watchers!!! #2018secured what I love about this it’s a life style and I still can enjoy at the same time ride wit me though this journey ! I CAN SHOW YOU BETTER THAN I CAN TELL YOU ... I’m so focused let’s go!!”

The videos also feature Khaled’s adorable son Asahd, to whom he credits the motivation for a lifestyle change in 2018. “Weight Watchers is all about being great and being your best self. My son is my love, my life, and I need to be great for him,” he said.

Winfrey, who has been the celebrity face of the brand for years now, welcomed DJ Khaled to the Weight Watchers’ family via Twitter with a sweet vote of confidence. “@djkhaled Welcome to #WWFreestyle. Can’t wait to see you #blessup this program,” she wrote.

It has not been reported how much DJ Khaled is being paid to shill for the brand, but it seems to have already paid off - CNBC reported that since the company announced Khaled as ambassador, Weight Watchers shares have risen 8 percent.

367,"Investment advisor Catherine Austin Fitts sums up what happened with the election of Donald Trump by saying, “It’s amazing because if you look at the faction that wanted to sacrifice the United States for empire, you basically had Washington, Wall Street, Silicon Valley and Hollywood. What they have done for the last 20 years is they have used the corporate media to create this color revolution, soft revolution, which is really a front so the 1% can control. The reality is if you look at what they were doing to destroy the United States, you just had an enormous, very wide group of people say enough. We did a discussion of the election several months ago, and I said if the right people in the military intelligence get behind Trump, he could win, and I think that’s exactly what happened. . . . I think the intelligence agencies understand that you cannot leave people to do what needs to be done with people that are used to printing all the funny money they want and have no clue how the economy works. . . . I had no idea how completely ignorant Hillary Clinton was of the whole fundamental economics of the situation. It’s because she’s been operating with cheap and free money for decades. I think the intelligence agencies were trying to assert adult supervision of the situation.”

On the mainstream media and Democrats rigging the election, Fitts says, “The problem with being able to rig things is you forget what is real. That is what has been so astonishing. All the people that have been rigging things all these years and the reason they could run things in an unproductive way, and away from market economics, is they could just print money. The minute you are not able to print money the game is up.”

What about the markets? Fitts, who managed 10’s of billions of dollars of assets as Assistant Housing Secretary in the Bush (41) Administration, says, “I am long-term positive and short-term negative because we just made a turn, and that turn is the beginning of facing things. Those things need to be faced, and that makes me optimistic long-term. If we pull certain things together, there is a very successful pathway, particularly if you sacrifice empire for North America. . . . If you let the productive people run things, wow! We’ve had the slugs running things for 20 years, and you let the productive people run things–watch out. This is why I am long-term positive.”

On gold and silver, Fitts contends, “I think we are in a long-term bull market for gold, but I don’t think the consolidation is over. I was hoping the consolidation was over given how it was trading in the first three quarters, but given how it is trading now, it looks like the consolidation may not be over. The reality is gold is a number of things. In Asia, it’s real money. I think as long as Asia is converging with per capita income, gold is going to have a floor under it, and silver too. I think that’s going to continue, and the bull market is going to reassert. If the engineering of moving from a debt model to an equity model is successful, then there is going to be a lot less concern of the fundamentals of the market and stability of the system. That won’t be as good for gold. I noticed some of your latest commentators say that gold is going to very high numbers. I think if we don’t succeed in turning around North America, then you could see gold go very high because of the instability. Right now, looking at all the markets, I say equities are stronger than gold.”

In closing, Fitts says, “We are so overdue for a 25% correction. . . . I think 2017 is going to be a composting. In the destruction of the old, let there be the creation of the new. We’re going to be creating the new, and we’re going to be destroying the old. It’s going to be quirky. There are going to be all kinds of black swans that could hit us. So, do I think we are going to have a major correction and lots of digestive problems? Yes, I do. Now, if the new administration gets what it wants by getting tax rates down and bringing capital back into the country, then there is going to be a very exciting future and a very exciting pathway for North America.”

774,"A significant Australian proponent of the QAnon conspiracy theory is a family friend of Scott Morrison, and his wife is on the prime minister’s staff.

The sprawling, disjointed and incoherent QAnon conspiracy variously claims that Donald Trump is leading a behind-the-scenes fight against a shadowy deep state, that powerful forces are hiding and protecting satanic paedophile rings, and that a secretive individual named Q leaves clues for his followers to decipher on internet forums.

The FBI has previously warned that QAnon could act as a potential motivator for “domestic extremists” and last year Reddit banned one of its main QAnon threads for repeated violations of its content policy, warning it would not tolerate content “that incites violence, disseminates personal information, or harasses” users.

In Australia, one of the more significant QAnon figures tweets under the handle @BurnedSpy34 and has amassed 21,000 Twitter followers in just over a year. BurnedSpy tweets daily QAnon material, including bizarre theories about Alexander Downer and Julie Bishop.

The Guardian has learned the identity of BurnedSpy and established he is a longstanding family friend of the Australian prime minister and his wife, Jenny.

The wife of BurnedSpy works on the prime minister’s staff.

There is no suggestion that the families’ close relationship has influenced Morrison, or that BurnedSpy poses a danger. BurnedSpy told the Guardian he had never sought to speak to the prime minister about QAnon.

“I have never spoken to Scott about anything of a political nature. I’m not an adviser. The idea of me talking to him about this ... it’s just not true,” he said.

But some who know BurnedSpy have become concerned about the extent of his immersion in the QAnon theory, saying it may leave him open to influence by others.

The family friendship is largely driven by the closeness between BurnedSpy’s wife and Jenny Morrison.

The pair have been lifelong friends, and the Guardian has learned the wife was recently employed on the prime minister’s staff in a publicly funded position, but not in any policy or advisory capacity. There is no evidence she shares her husband’s views.

BurnedSpy’s tweets have frequently been cited as “world-class” in QAnon research threads on 8Chan, the forum Australian telecommunications companies were encouraged to block by Morrison’s government after it hosted the Christchurch terrorist attack videos.

BurnedSpy’s Twitter account makes repeated claims about Downer, a frequent target of QAnon. In a thread last year, he linked a 1996 child abuse inquiry in Australia to Downer’s role in kickstarting the Russian interference investigation.

“It’s no coincidence that Downer did NOT want Trump elected,” he tweeted.

He greeted this week’s news that Australia had offered assistance to the investigation into the Mueller probe, including Downer’s involvement, by tweeting “Game on!”.

BurnedSpy explained the tweet to the Guardian by saying: “So as for ‘game on’, for two years I’ve been interested in the Australian high commissioner to the UK’s involvement in what I consider as a coup against an incumbent sitting US president, I think that’s a story.”

There is no substance to his claims that Downer’s role in the Russia investigation had anything to do with child abuse, and no evidence that Downer did not want Trump elected.

BurnedSpy has also questioned whether the former Australian foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop was connected to the conspiracy through her wearing of red shoes.

“If you want to do your research into the US context, the red shoes are purported to be very much a paedophilia shout out,” he told the Guardian. “And there are some extremely odd photos of large groups of men in suits wearing red shoes, many of whom are promoting paedophilia.”

There is no evidence that Bishop is connected to any such conspiracy.

In other posts, he questioned whether 8Chan was taken offline after the Christchurch attacks because it was the only uncensored platform that Q could use.

The connections between his family and the Morrisons are long standing.

His wife has known Scott and Jenny since they were children, and is a close friend. The Guardian has seen multiple photos of the trio together. She attended their wedding and frequently interacts with Jenny Morrison on Facebook.

Photos also show BurnedSpy and Scott Morrison together.

One source close to BurnedSpy’s family, who asked not to be identified, expressed concerns about his immersion in QAnon material and warned he might be open to manipulation or influence.

“[His] beliefs have become more unusual and I have concerns about how easily [he] is influenced or infiltrated himself.”

The source said he was frequently heard making references to “great awakening” or “dark to light” – common refrains of QAnon – during conversation.

When contacted for comment, BurnedSpy accused the Guardian of preparing a “hit piece” on him.

He said his friendship with the Morrisons was unrelated to the Twitter account.

“I’m not going to diminish the relationship, that’s not appropriate either. Yeah we’re friends. That’s good. People have friends.”

BurnedSpy and his son, also a QAnon follower, have met prominent US-based QAnon figures.

The deceased US actor Isaac Kappy, a former QAnon proponent who frequently made unsubstantiated accusations of paedophilia against other Hollywood actors, met the pair when he came to Australia late last year.

TMZ last year reported that Kappy was the focus of a police investigation after threatening two celebrities and accusing one of paedophilia.

Also pictured at the meeting was Eliahi Priest, who has previously spoken at a rally for the True Blue Crew, a far-right Australian group.

BurnedSpy told the Guardian that Priest turned up at the meeting without his knowledge.

Priest was visited by the Australian federal police earlier this year after sending concerning emails to government officials. The officers asked Priest if he needed mental health support or counselling.

He claimed to have passed on information to Morrison, via the individual controlling the BurnedSpy account.

“I was hanging out with the prime minister’s best friend at his house in Sydney,” Priest said. “[He] was to pass this information to the prime minister, and he did.”

There is no evidence to substantiate Priest’s claims.

BurnedSpy told the Guardian he had met Priest only once – not intentionally – and had no ongoing association with him. The pair have now fallen out.

“He makes out that I’m part of [Morrison’s] political team,” he said. “Knowing someone is a far cry from … you know lots of people, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re invited to conversations and you’re allowed to offer an opinion without permission.”

BurnedSpy has also linked Hillsong, where Morrison has prayed, to mind control, and praised Morrison for his apology to child abuse survivors, during which the prime minister used the term “ritual sexual abuse”. The use of that term was interpreted by QAnon followers as referring to satanic ritual abuse.

He described the movement as “peaceful” and an alternative source of information, research and news for those who have lost faith in mainstream media. He said he had never been on the 8Chan forum and did not post there.

Experts say conspiracy theories such as QAnon risk leaving their followers polarised and shut off from the outside world, making them unpredictable.

Followers of the online “Pizzagate” conspiracy attacked Washington’s Comet Ping Pong restaurant in December 2016, believing internet rumours that prominent Democrats were harbouring child sex slaves there.

An armed QAnon follower blocked traffic at Hoover Dam in Nevada with an armoured truck in June 2018, calling for the release of the “OIG Report”, an unredacted Justice Department inspector general report which QAnon believes will expose a shadowy network entrenched in the government.

Australian National University associate professor Colin Klein, who has studied the varying belief systems behind conspiracy theories, said there was a risk when individuals began to believe ordinary sources of information were “unreliable and part of the conspiracy”.

“All-encompassing conspiracy theories insulate themselves from the world, which makes it much easier to become polarised and violent,” Klein said.",mainstream,M185a5,illuminati; pizzagate
756,"Picture this: You’re the elusive chanteuse Mariah Carey and it’s New Year’s Eve.

You’re prepared to redeem yourself from last year’s sad performance by singing yet again in front of a live crowd and a televised audience, but this time you want some hot tea. However, there is none. It’s a total disaster. What do you do?

This was the real-life situation faced by Carey as she performed on Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest. “Happy New Year!” she called to the crowd. “I just want to take a sip of tea, if they will let me,” she said before realizing that there was none.

“They told me there would be tea! Oh, it’s a disaster!” she lamented, faltering only for a moment before remembering that the show had to go on. “Okay, well, we’ll just have to rough it,” she conceded. “I’m going to be like everybody else, with no hot tea.”

Admittedly, it was freezing in Manhattan on New Year’s Eve, and cold, dry air is not the ideal environment to sing in. A warm beverage would have probably soothed Mariah’s throat after reaching those sky-high notes that she is known for, but nevertheless, she was able to give a great performance even though she had to suffer through it like a plebe without her tea.

351,"There is a shared concern for these monographs. Both books are concerned with how the nature of groups, taken together with our evolved psychology, can explain informational dynamics. Their central explanatory targets are the spread and persistence of falsities, the success or failure of charismatic demagogues, and the baffling attractiveness of turgid academic prose. Yet the many examples that Acerbi and Mercier focus on—do I share this post? Spread that rumor? Believe those doomsayers?—tend to have low costs and consequences. The category of reflective beliefs, in fact, can be read as a mechanism for explaining why beliefs with seemingly high costs (being a ‘911 truther’, say) nonetheless do not have the costs they are purported to have (like refusing all engagement with a presumed to be corrupt government). Reflective beliefs just aren’t acted upon.

There is one possible exception. Mercier discusses a kind of action he calls ‘bridge-burning’. These involve making statements that are unacceptable and offensive to a group. One might think then, that these are high-cost actions. And in one sense they are: they reduce or eliminate opportunities for collaboration, communication, and exchange with the aggrieved party. But in another sense they are not. These ‘bridge-burning’ exercises are, on Mercier’s framework, a means of ingratiating oneself to a different, friendlier group—they increase one’s credibility with this new group precisely because one has nowhere else to turn. And this is why Mercier thinks we have mechanisms for assessing the receptivity of our claims: we need to know whether we’ll find a welcome party when all routes out are ashes.

‘Bridge-burning’ can be a high-risk strategy. But there are plenty of situations that are high-risk, high-cost, and made under conditions of uncertainty—do I invest in this method or that one? Do I signal my affiliation to those guys or these ones? When do I join in? Such high-stakes social and economic situations occur in many situations where informational dynamics, judgement aggregation, and group dynamics come together in highly context-sensitive ways.

Acerbi’s book is sensitive to these issues, and introduces some tools for measuring the organization of social networks, the strength of connections, and the availability of information. For instance, Acerbi notes that many social media platforms tend to have networks with a ‘hub-like’ or ‘star-like’ network structure, where multiple individuals link to a central node. Take Donald Trump’s twitter account, which has over seventy million followers yet only follows forty-some other accounts. His twitter network is very ‘star-like’, with accounts connecting to his like so many points radiating out of a central star. Interestingly, however, informational dynamics on these star-like networks can create illusions, giving “the misleading impression of polarization on Twitter, while, in fact, the great majority of accounts [are] not or [are] scarcely polarized.” (CEDA 110) This is what Lerman et al. (2016) have called a ‘majority illusion’; that despite being a minority, a population can appear to be in the majority because of the structural features of social networks.Footnote 7

It matters if one perceives one’s self to be in the minority. Centola et al. (2005), for instance, have argued that such a perception can drive the expansion of otherwise unpopular norms. Networks that facilitate ‘majority illusions’ might thus exacerbate such spreading. Likewise, Trump’s informational reach matters. Maybe multiple agents get together to discuss the American Revolutionary War. They might talk about how revolutionary soldiers ‘took over the British airports’, recalling that they heard this information from somewhere. Given that multiple independent agents recall that information, this might lend additional credence to the claims. But the seeming independence is false and driven by network effects: all had heard it from a common source, Trump’s Fourth of July “Salute to America.”Footnote 8 Lest this seem like a facile example, Mercier deploys something like this mechanism to explain the start of the Iraq War and the spread of religions (NBY, 172–176).

Yet while issues around network topology creep in here-and-there in Acerbi and Mercier’s books, neither gives what I think to be sufficient attention. There is now a large and powerful body of work on the effects of social network topologies on information dynamics coming out of social epistemology, economics, and other literatures. The analytic and agent-based models of these literatures show how network organization interacting with information aggregation procedures can generate surprising individual- and group-level effects.

I think there are plenty of reasons why both Acerbi and Mercier should want to pay more attention this expansive literature. The first is that it provides a suite of tools, metrics, and explanatory models for understanding the trade-offs and consequences of different network topologies, information aggregation strategies, and group compositions. These directly address the social phenomena that Acerbi and Mercier target, offering a distinct perspective on the information dynamics of innovation diffusion (e.g. Kiesling et al. 2012), testimonial norms (e.g. Mayo-Wilson 2014), and conformity effects (e.g. Mohseni and Williams 2019).

The second reason concerns the role of background information and context in both Acerbi and Mercier’s books. Incoming information is tested against background information for plausibility, and shapes the trajectories of cultural change. But this suggests that information dynamics will be highly sensitive to the order in which information is received—our priors can be biased and our evaluation non-commutative. This matters substantially for information dynamics, offering routes for systematic group-level disagreement (Zollman 2010), polarization (Goldberg and Stein 2018), and deviation from optimal or more veridical outcomes (Holman and Bruner 2017).

And third, social network models provide contrasts to the assumptions at work in Acerbi and Mercier. Both suggest, in more or less the same form, that the “spread of most misconceptions is explained by their intuitively appealing content, rather than by the skills of those who propound them.” (NBY 260) This is a bold claim, especially given that modelling results from social networks suggest that under quite minimal assumptions, wholly rational agents can end up pursuing and perpetuating false beliefs (O’Connor and Weatherall 2019). These effects can be exacerbated by malicious actors (ibid.), but can also be produced where informational uncertainty combines with specific network topologies (O’Connor and Weatherall 2020).

This is what I meant when I said above that the gullibility account is a useful foil, but that ultimately Mercier is punching-down. Mercier associates the gullibility account with a deferential attitude towards authority and an unquestioning acceptance of all information; that human beings are mindless sheeple subject to herd behavior. But the picture endorsed by Mercier and Acerbi—with rational agents operating under uncertainty—can still generate herd-like behavior (Banerjee 1992; Hung and Plott 2001), conformity and free-riding (List and Pettit 2004), and the persistence of misinformed groups (Golub and Jackson 2010) under a wide range of plausible conditions.

So I think there are good reasons why Acerbi and Mercier should engage with these nearby literatures. But there is no reason why that engagement should be a one-way street. Many of the models employed in social epistemology and economics employ sparse characterizations of human agents and their psychology. Mercier and Acerbi’s work, by contrast, draws on experimental results from psychology, paleoanthropological evidence, and evolutionary reasoning to back substantive claims about human cognition. Feeding these psychological and evolutionary assumptions into network models might offer a means of exploring their claims about human cognitive evolution, cultural change, and the spread of misinformation.

At the same time, such an exchange might generate useful helpful friction. Current network models often share a basic assumption with Acerbi and Mercier—notably, some form of rationality. One might think, then, that these models are grist to the authors’ evolutionary mills. But they might not. For many network models are minimal models (Weisberg 2013), that show how significant group level effects can be driven by few psychological assumptions. These suggest that while the mechanisms endorsed in Acerbi and Mercier’s books may be sufficient to generate the relevant phenomena, they are not necessary. There are other empirically-supported characterizations of how human beings acquire, interpret, and transmit information. How these two characterizations should be reconciled is an open question. But looking at the rich theoretical and modelling literature in economics, social epistemology and sociology provides not only a strong juxtaposition to the two accounts on offer, but also a rich set of tools for exploring their hypotheses and claims.

However this interaction plays out, it is worth closing on a positive note. Both Mercier and Acerbi’s volumes are enjoyable, story-driven journeys. They guide the reader through large and expanding literatures in an entertaining and illuminating way. They are upbeat about human capabilities and provide a useful optimistic counterpoint to the recent spate of epistemological doomsayers.",mainstream,M0db02,pizzagate
261,"Vice President-elect Mike Pence received a surprise dinner invitation on Monday night from his new neighbors in leafy northwest Washington. They asked him to dine with them at Comet Ping Pong, the pizzeria at the center of debate over whether allies of President-elect Donald J. Trump are spreading so-called fake news.

In an open letter posted on the online blogging platform Medium, Mr. Pence’s neighbors — part of a coalition that describes itself as opposed to the “unacceptable practices and policies in the Trump administration” — implored the vice president-elect to “help bring an end to this madness through the simple act of breaking bread.” There was no immediate comment from Mr. Pence or a spokesman.

During the transition period, Mr. Pence and his family have rented a temporary home in a heavily Democratic area not far from Comet Ping Pong, a popular dining spot for families with children. The restaurant became caught up in a bizarre conspiracy theory after fake news reports claimed the pizzeria was operating a child sex slave ring linked to Hillary Clinton.

Earlier this month, that fake story led to the firing of real bullets, when a gunman showed up at Comet Ping Pong, saying he had come to “self-investigate” the claims, and fired shots inside, terrifying the entire neighborhood.

Kanye West is under psychiatric observation at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for “his own health and safety”. The rapper was “acting erratically” at his trainer’s house when the call was made. West reportedly did not want to go to the hospital and was handcuffed to a gurney while being transported.

A source familiar with the case said Los Angeles police responded to a medical welfare call about 1:20 p.m. No criminal activity was involved; the decision to hospitalize West at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center was for his own health and safety, the sources said. Neighbors described the scene on the 900 block of North Laurel Avenue to NBC4, saying there were “security guards, fire trucks and police. The house that firefighters and police responded to is owned by Harley Pasternak, a celebrity trainer with clients that come to him.

Kanye’s hospitalization occurred only days after his infamous rant during a concert in Sacramento where he retroactively supported Trump and lashed out against Mark Zuckerberg, Beyoncé and Jay-Z (while pleading him to not send ‘killers at his head’).

A source told People.com that Kanye feels that he is under ‘spiritual attack’.

“He feels like he’s under spiritual attack, and has been for awhile. It’s not just the big things; it’s smaller, quieter things, internal things. You might think that it’s about Kim’s robbery, and while that didn’t help, that’s not what’s going on here. He’s dealing with a lot more subtle issues,” the source tells PEOPLE. “His mother died in November, so this time of year always brings him a lot of pain. He keeps that pain internalized, but sometimes will talk about how hard this time of year is for him. He works through the pain every November,” the source adds.

He leans in and listens, and comes away a stronger, better man. But it hurts him; his spirit is vexed. But that’s where growth comes from,” the source says. “Sometimes, darkness creeps in, and Kanye wrestles against it. He talks about that a lot. It’s exhausting, and it takes everything he’s got. He’s just so tired now; he’s very low energy and feels like there’s a grieving in his spirit.

While most media sources talk about ‘exhaustion’ and ‘sleep deprivation’ (which is quite possible), these symptoms might be the result of something deeper. Kanye is indeed another artist that has exposed, for way too long, to the toxic cesspool that is Hollywood. While it brought him success, it also disturbed his very core.

1319,"“If the post-truth order is primarily marked by a generalized loss of trust in traditional sources of authority and information as well as a growing fragmentation of the media sphere, this book convincingly argues that the truth of the post-truth condition is not to be found in the details but within a global discursive space where state and non-state actors, established powers and emerging political networks, build surprising alliances to hegemonize the public sphere and upend the post-1989 world order.”

“Finally, we have a theory of post-truth that emerges from an international or global analysis. In this excellent development of empirically-grounded post-truth theory, Cosentino moves from well-known cases such as Pizzagate and Russian trolls in the U.S. 2016 presidential election, to cases that have received little to no attention in media and political communication studies, such as the ""White Helmets"" rumors amplified by Russian media in the Syrian civil war, the Facebook hate speech campaign against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, and the disinformation apparatus that propelled Bolsonaro to power in Brazil. Cosentino’s analysis is also unique in its attention to the use of an array of platforms and spaces of media that are exploited for disinformative and misinformative purposes, including 4chan and 8chan, Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter, in addition to traditional news media. His work engages with the problems of international political economy in the post-truth matrix, especially how the agents of post-truth exploit the weaknesses of media laws. Finally, he does not shy away from drawing lessons from his case studies for technical, educational, regulatory and political intervention. Social Media and the Post-Truth World Order is a welcome contribution to a growing body of theory and empirical analysis in post-truth studies.”

“In this book, Gabriele Cosentino masterfully addresses perhaps the greatest lacuna in post-truth studies by demonstrating its global nature. By dedicating a substantial portion of the text to cases beyond the West, he manages to not only broaden our geographical scope of understanding post-truth but also to tease out the latter’s preconditions and characteristics that remain constant across national, political, and cultural contexts and can, therefore, be seen as the phenomenon's core traits. Ultimately, this timely book demonstrates that post-truth is not some isolated manifestation of fakery, but a collective domain that spans the world as an alternative self-sustaining universe.

940,"Macroeconomic researcher Rod Kirby thinks the world is well on its way to much higher inflation. Kirby explains, “Some people say there is a dollar shortage in the world. I do not believe there is a dollar shortage. I think we are seeing evidence that there are too many dollars in the world, not too few. Look at real estate prices around the world. In Canada, they are at record levels. In America, they are at record levels. Real estate prices are at record levels in Britain. There are record levels in Australia. They are at record levels in China. This is not what you’d expect in an environment where there are too few dollars. We are seeing the equity markets rally day after day and make new all-time highs. These are not the kinds of things you see when there are too few dollars. In my view, this might be the thin edge of the wedge of a crack-up boom. Money is getting to the street because money is being taken out of dark pools on the dark side of the U.S. Treasury and is being injected into the market place as bonds are being sold off and redeemed. The world is flush with money, extremely flush with money.”

So, is this the reason some of the biggest money managers and investors on the planet are talking about moving money into gold and silver? Kirby, who sources gold and silver by the ton for clients, says, “These people are very perceptive. . . . These people are aware that there are too many dollars chasing too few things, and they realize what they are witnessing around them can’t be happening unless money is being expanded, and money is being expanded around the world. As I say, I believe it’s coming out of the dark side of the U.S. Treasury. This can make things very unstable going forward. If you produce too much money, you run the risk of triggering a hyperinflation. If we do end up in a hyperinflationary event, the price of metals will soar. They will soar measured against anything else that goes up in value as well.”

Kirby also thinks that Trump is meeting resistance from both parties because top people are involved in human trafficking. Kirby contends, “There are emails suggesting that vast, vast numbers of highly connected politicos are engaged in human trafficking and possibly pedophilia. To me, there is enough smoke surrounding the issue that there is very likely something to it. My feeling is the powers that be are trying to cripple Trump. Trump has put these people on notice that he’s going to root out these people in human trafficking and in the sex trade. If the allegations are factual, this would be a reason why both sides of the aisle are showing animosity towards Trump and his agenda. . . . There are some people with good track records who say some very, very big names are going to be consumed with this whole issue.”

On the upcoming debt ceiling and the hard stop on March 15th, Kirby says, “If the debt ceiling is not raised, Trump is going to have a very, very hard time conducting his agenda. Also, many of the higher echelons on both sides of the aisle, who could possibly be tainted by the sex trafficking issue, are going to have very little interest in funding Donald Trump’s agenda, particularly if his agenda is outing them for unthinkable acts. So, there is a motivation in officialdom not to give Trump a clean credit card. . . . In all my life, I have never seen the angst, the vitriol and the hate being expressed towards the leader of your country from both sides of the aisle.

943,"Could “fake news” have helped determine the outcome of the 2016 presidential election?

Social media users and intensely partisan news broadcasts disseminated a massive number of messages during the campaign. Many of these messages demonized candidates and seriously distorted the facts presented to voters. One recent study of nearly 25,000 election social media messages shared by Michigan voters identified nearly half as “unverified WikiLeaks content and Russian-origin news stories” that fall “under the definition of propaganda based on its use of language and emotional appeals.”

What hasn’t been clear, however, is how much of an impact – if any – these “fake news” items had on the outcome of the election. To our knowledge, there have been no empirical studies that have systematically assessed the extent to which believing fake news stories influenced voting decisions in 2016. So, we set out to do one.

We are scholars associated with the Comparative National Elections Project, which is coordinated at The Ohio State University. In December 2016, we commissioned YouGov to conduct a nationwide post-election survey. Our study concludes that fake news most likely did have a substantial impact on the voting decisions of a strategically important set of voters.

The survey had 1,600 respondents. We focus our analysis on the 2016 electoral behavior of 585 respondents who had voted for Barack Obama in 2012. This strategic subset of voters was selected for two reasons.

First, restricting our analysis to former Obama supporters allowed us to weed out those respondents who were hostile to all Democratic candidates.

Second, if Hillary Clinton had retained the support of Obama voters, she would have most likely won the 2016 election. Instead, just 77 percent of Obama voters supported Clinton. Our survey data show that 10 percent of these former Obama voters cast ballots for Trump in 2016, 4 percent switched to minor parties and 8 percent did not vote.

Our key research question is: What accounts for these defections?

Our survey asked 281 questions, including three false statements best characterized as fake news – two negative statements about Hillary Clinton and one positive statement about Donald Trump. All three were widely disseminated through social media and spread by mainstream and partisan news outlets.

The first is that “Hillary Clinton is in very poor health due to a serious illness.” Twenty-five percent of all survey respondents believed that this was “definitely true” or “probably true,” as did 12 percent of our former Obama supporters.

The second is a statement that asked our respondents if they believed that “During her time as U.S. secretary of state, Hillary Clinton approved weapon sales to Islamic jihadists, including ISIS.” Thirty-five percent of our national sample believed that Clinton had sold weapons to the Islamic State, as did 20 percent of former Obama voters.

Finally, the third is a statement that “Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump for president prior to the election.” About 10 percent of our national sample and 8 percent of Obama supporters thought this statement was true.

Belief in these fake news stories is very strongly linked to defection from the Democratic ticket by 2012 Obama voters. Among respondents who didn’t believe any of the fake news stories, 89 percent cast ballots for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Sixty-one percent of those who believed one fake news item voted for Clinton. But only 17 percent of those who believed two or all three of these false assertions voted for Clinton.

To be sure, data from a one-time survey cannot “prove” that these fake news items caused former Obama voters to defect. It is also possible that someone who chose not to vote for Clinton might endorse these false statements after the fact in order to rationalize their voting decision.

We also explored a number of other possible explanations for these voters’ defections.

What else could explain these defections?

The Clinton campaign heavily emphasized gender issues in an attempt to mobilize female voters. Could this have alienated men to the extent that they abandoned their prior support for the Democratic presidential candidate? Our data provide no support for such a claim. An identical 23 percent of both male and female respondents who had voted for Obama in 2012 defected from the Democratic ticket.

Did the lack of an African-American presidential candidate lead black voters to waiver in their commitment to the Democratic candidate? No. Indeed, fewer African-American voters (20 percent) defected from Clinton than did white voters (23 percent).

Age is weakly related to defection from Clinton. While 20 percent of voters over 35 abandoned the Democratic ticket in 2016, 30 percent of younger voters did so.

Education is also weakly associated with defection. Among college-educated former Obama voters, just 16 percent did not vote for Clinton, but the percentage almost doubled to 27 percent defecting for those with lower educational attainment.

More overtly political variables had a stronger impact. Half of those who placed themselves near the conservative end of the ideological scale defected from the Democratic candidate, while only 14 percent of those on the left did so.

Similarly, dissatisfaction with the condition of the economy also had an impact: Just 12 percent of those who thought that the economic situation at the time of the survey was “good” or “very good” abandoned Hillary Clinton, while 39 percent who regarded the economy as “poor” or “very poor” at the time of the survey defected from the Democratic ticket.

Party identification exerted a stronger influence. Among the former Obama voters who identified themselves as Democrats, 7 percent did not vote for Clinton. This rose to 40 percent among independents and to 68 percent among those who identified with the Republican, Libertarian or Green parties.

So do all of these alternative factors mean it’s impossible to measure the unique impact of belief in fake news on the vote in 2016? Actually social science offers us a way. Multiple regression analysis is a tool that allows researchers to account for many different factors influencing behavior, in this case defecting from the Democratic ticket in 2016.

We used this tool to estimate the joint impact on the vote of all of these alternative explanatory factors. The first equation we ran included gender, race, age, education, ideological orientation, dissatisfaction with the condition of the economy and party identification. All together, these variables “explained” 38 percent of the likelihood of defection.

We then added the fake news items to the equation to measure their impact. The three fake news items explained an additional 14 percent of the likelihood of Obama voters defecting after the influence of all of the other variables had been taken into consideration.

We also added one more compelling element to our study. Using “feeling thermometers,” we measured how much each respondent liked or disliked Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. If defection of Obama voters was only due to disliking Hillary Clinton or liking Donald Trump, then the introduction of this thermometer variable into the equation should make the link with fake news disappear.

Though how people felt about Clinton and Trump did somewhat reduce the strength of the relationship between fake news and defection, it did not eliminate it. Belief in fake news remained a significant predictor of defecting from Clinton. In sum, even after the impact of all of these other factors is taken into consideration, former Obama voters who believed one or more of these fake news stories were 3.3 times more likely to defect from the Democratic ticket in 2016 than those who did not believe any of these false claims.

That may not seem like much, but Clinton lost the presidency by about 78,000 votes (0.6 percent of nationwide vote) cast in the key battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Though our evidence does not “prove” that belief in fake news “caused” these former Obama voters to defect from the Democratic candidate in 2016, our study results suggest that it is highly likely that the pernicious pollution of our political discourse by fake news was sufficient to influence the outcome of what was a very close election.",mainstream,M10a73,pizzagate
889,"Some ‘dark’ revelations are and have come to light, especially within the past 6 years alone. But the truth is, they’re not really so much ‘dark’ as the human mind likes to label them. At the soul level, the spiritual level, they are simply experiences, how the human mind chooses to view it is another story. Obviously, we label them as ‘dark’ because they do not resonate. The idea of taking another against their will and subjecting them to such things goes against the moral code we are all born with, as do many other things. This stuff can be scary to even think about, so many of us turn a blind eye but the fact remains, silence does absolutely nothing, and it’s time we ask ourselves, who are we really accepting and electing as our ‘leaders’? As our governors? Decision makers? The ones that seem to create the future, our interests, our wants and needs, the ones we have chosen to depend on for our food, health and water? Can we really trust them? What’s really going on in the upper echelons of the deep state?

It’s no different from the Royal Family, and wedding celebrations that are televised to billions across the globe. So much attention is given to these events it’s embarrassing, and makes you realize how little we know of our own history. If you really look into the history of the Royal Family, and Royal Family bloodlines, things aren’t as they’ve always been presented to us. Why is it on the attention of so many? Because that’s the way they do things, it’s pure manufactured attention, literal brainwashing, simply because this aristocratic family, one of multiple, completely controls mainstream media. This is quite clear if you simply follow the money, and all of the corporate and government influence that is put into mainstream media, and the history of royalty as well as the relationship between the church and state for centuries.

These people are portrayed as ‘good’ people, and perhaps many of them are, but the fact remains, it’s just down right weird how they are made to be worshipped and idolized, just like many presidents, politicians and entertainers, almost as if they’re being used as distractions. It seems that ‘they’ can paint anybody they’d like in whatever light they please, as well as manufacture information for the masses to consume.

Meanwhile, there are lawsuits and multiple accusations in these fields, among the rich, famous and aristocratic, that really make one wonder what’s going on? And what could our world ‘leaders’ really be involved in?

The Vatican is a great example, they’ve paid nearly $4 billion already to settle child molestation lawsuits.

Pedophilia is a big problem, and has been for a while. For decades, and more recently with the Harvey Weinstein case, Corey Feldman’s revelations and more, people in positions of great power have been implicated in this type of activity, but it doesn’t stop in Hollywood. Pedophilia and child trafficking has plagued the world of politics as well as the military industrial complex for a long time.

The recent Pizzagate scandal involving long time high ranking politician John Podesta, forced many people to look into this theory more. Jeffrey Epstein is another classic example, or the fact that a recent NBC news report claimed that Hillary Clinton, while acting as secretary of state, shut down an investigation into an elite pedophile ring in State Department ranks in order to avoid scandal and protect the careers of high ranking officials and an ambassador. James Grazioplene, a high ranking retired army general who worked in the Pentagon and as the Vice President of DynCorp, is currently facing six rape charges of underaged persons. As far back as 2005, U.S. congresswoman Cynthia Mckinney grilled Donald Rumself on private military contractor’s (DynCorp) child trafficking business of selling women and children.

The crazy thing is that sometimes it seems to be normalized. Even the UK government & the Catholic Church have sated that children can consent to such things…

The royal family is no exception, Jeffrey Epstein (linked above) can be seen pictured with multiple Royals by a simple google search. Britain has been rocked with pedophile scandals since Royal Family friend, Jimmy Savile, was involved in widespread child sex abuse.

A picture speaks a thousands words, but it’s not that Prince Charles has many memories with him and is seen photographed with him all the time, it’s the actual evidence and connections that are briefly touched upon below.

Documents show that the Director General of MI5 from 1985 to 1988, Anthony Duff, told Thatcher’s Cabinet Secretary that an unnamed MP had a “a penchant for small boys”. Duff’s 1986 letter to the Cabinet Secretary reveals that he accepted the MP’s denial of any wrongdoing largely on the basis that: “At the present stage… the risks of political embarrassment to the government is rather greater than the security danger.” You can read more about that here.

Even employees of the British Royal Family have been implicated.

The encouraging thing is that all of this information seems to be quite mainstream, and it seems that almost everybody knows about it. But then why does it appear that so much of the publics attention goes into watching these events? If you look at what is trending, Royal Family events are huge.

A member of the Royal family was claimed to be part of a suspected paedophile ring under investigation by police in the late 1980s, a former Metropolitan Police officer said he was told by a detective sergeant that the investigation into the ring, which was also claimed to include an MP, was shut down for national security reasons. You can read more about that here.

This has happened many times, and it really goes to show you where the power lies… there are connections everywhere.

Something New Has To Be Created

It can be hard to accept that the global elite, the ones who have such influence and power in this world could be doing such things, but is it really all that surprising? Personally, after looking at what’s happened overseas in Iraq, what’s happening in Syria, what happened in Libya and the slew of false flag terrorism, these are lies that have been dished out from these mouths for decades. They are nothing but puppets representing a greater power with an agenda, an agenda that the world is now waking up to.

The thing is, we are all co-creators of our reality here. The collective consciousness includes everyone, so while those powerful group of people try and create one experience, the masses waking up to, acknowledging it, and deciding that the information does not resonate, can actually create something else.

Things are in a constant state of change, and the question as to when big events, revelations, and changes will occur is basically the decision of all of us, and it’s continually speeding up and the disclosure of a wealth of information that seems unbelievable will continue to happen.

The fact that our global elite doesn’t really have the best interests of humanity in mind, and that they do not make decisions for the betterment of humanity, planet Earth, and all life upon it means it’s time for a chance. It’s time to do away with this system, and create something new. We cannot keep doing the same thing, playing the same game, and simply expect things to change.

One thing is quite certain, those whom we hand over our own power to make decisions, are in no place to do so.

Another question we have to ask ourselves, is why are these people doing what they are doing? Without judgement, anger, or a feeling or need to punish or inflict harm on another…

We have to work on resolving that which does not resonate in a much more productive, healing manner.

890,"Only two shows in and controversy has already hit Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly, the anchor's news magazine on her new network, NBC.

Following Sunday's announcement that Infowars founder Alex Jones will be a guest on the next program to discuss ""controversies and conspiracies,"" JPMorgan Chase & Co. requested all of its advertisements—both those on TV and digital ones—be pulled from NBC News programming until after the interview airs, the Wall Street Journal first reported.

Interviewing Jones, the far-right radio host and writer, has caused a backlash online, with protesters taking to social media with the hashtag #shameonNBC. Earlier today, JPMorgan's chief marketing officer, Kristin Lemkau, joined in, tweeting that she is ""repulsed"" that Kelly would give Jones any airtime.

Jones, who is known for his promotion of conspiracy theories, has called the Sandy Hook and Aurora shootings hoaxes promoted by those who object to the Second Amendment. Families of those killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school massacre, including Nelba Márquez-Greene and Cristina Hassinger, have criticized the network and Kelly for having him on the show and giving him a platform.

Sandy Hook Promise, a gun violence prevention organization, also broke from Kelly. She was supposed to emcee a June 14 gala for the organization.

""This decision was spurred by NBC’s planned broadcast of Kelly’s interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who believes the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, CT, was a hoax,” a statement rfom the organization read.

In addition to the conspiracy theory about Sandy Hook, Jones has said the September 11 attacks were an ""inside job"", helped perpetuate the Pizzagate hoax, which led to a shooting (he apologized) and spread false rumors linking yogurt brand Chobani, which was founded by a Kurdish immigrant, to sexual assault.

Even Jones, it seems, doesn't want the interview aired. He tweeted on Monday that the segment ""misrepresents"" his views on Sandy Hook, although it's not clear in what way. (In the attached video, he does say he believes children died at the massacre, but also adds that the media spun the event and used it as a way to advocate against gun ownership.)

While NBC News and NBC's advertising unit have not replied to requests for comment, Kelly has tweeted her commitment to having Jones on.

""POTUS's been on & praises @RealAlexJones' show. He's giving Infowars a WH press credential. Many don't know him; our job is 2 shine a light,"" she wrote in response to one critic.

On Tuesday, she issued a longer statement defending her decision. In it, she agreed that calling Sandy Hook a hoax was ""revolting,"" but that it prompted many questions that she hoped to answer in the interview.

While JPMorgan's week-long boycott is probably doing little to hurt NBC's bottom line and its finite nature makes it different than the boycott that did in Bill O'Reilly's show, this is likely not the kind of publicity NBC was hoping its nascent program would receive (though, some may say, all press is good press, particularly if Kelly pulls off a challenging interview).

NBC bet a lot—close to $20 million, a prime Sunday night spot and a daily morning hour—on Kelly when the former Fox News star switched networks to join the peacock network. So far, the ratings have been decent, but not spectacular or high enough to beat 60 Minutes, and the reviews have been rather negative.

One concern in her switch was that she'd have trouble transitioning from the right-leaning Fox News to the centrist NBC, and the Jones interview may be a hard sell to the more liberal NBC viewers. Then again, with some online, such as watchdog group Sleeping Giants, calling this a ratings ploy, perhaps the interview will bring the boost in viewers Kelly needs (albeit without at least one advertiser).",mainstream,M0eb01,pizzagate
727,"In a surprising moment of self-awareness, Wolfgang Münchau just published an editorial in the Financial Times comparing the gatekeepers of the “global liberal order” (the FT included) to Marie Antoinette and the House of Bourbon, blindly “let them eat cake”-ing their way toward their own guillotine.

Münchau knows of what he speaks; as associate editor of the Financial Times he is in the unenviable position of acting as the spokesman for the banksters ensconced in the City of London. And in case you haven’t noticed, the banksters aren’t exactly the most popular people in the world right now. But don’t take my word for it, take his:

“Some revolutions could have been avoided if the old guard had only refrained from provocation. There is no proof of a ‘let them eat cake’ incident. But this is the kind of thing Marie Antoinette could have said. It rings true. The Bourbons were hard to beat as the quintessential out-of-touch establishment. “Our global liberal democratic establishment is behaving in much the same way. At a time when Britain has voted to leave the EU, when Donald Trump has been elected US president, and Marine Le Pen is marching towards the Elysée Palace, we — the gatekeepers of the global liberal order — keep on doubling down.”

Now I think we all understand what is happening here: A demoralized and disoriented would-be ruling class, reeling from the fact that they are no longer able to control the narrative that shapes public perception of the world, is looking to re-legitimize themselves by re-connecting with the public.

The trick is old but effective. Admit wrongdoings and missteps. Acknowledge the anger the public is feeling. Adjust rhetoric as needed to reconnect the public with the goal of constructing the “global liberal order.” Rinse and repeat as necessary.

To give credit to Münchau, he is quite good at this trick, and some of the one-liners from his editorial should be branded on the foreheads of all the slimy politicians and their bankster overlords. “Because of a tendency to exaggerate, macroeconomists are no longer considered experts on the macroeconomy.” You don’t say?

Still, the editorial comes embedded with the booby traps we would expect from a born-and-bred bankster mouthpiece. The problem, we are told, is “uncontrolled flows of people and capital” and “unequal income distribution.” Gee, I wonder how the ruling oligarchs propose to fix this problem? When your only tool is the hammer of government regulation and intervention, every problem looks like a nail with a little too much freedom. Just another thing for the loving-but-misguided politicians to regulate back into proper order, I suppose.

But keep in mind, the “global liberal order” will not collapse quietly, and for every “good cop” like Münchau wearing the velvet glove of fuzzy feel-good populist rhetoric there is a “bad cop” who is just waiting to expose the iron fist.

Like the Atlantic Council. They have just taken the cake in the unbelievable race-to-the-bottom of the neocon-led Cold War 2.0 push against “Russian propaganda” (aka anyone and everyone, including The Corbett Report, that doesn’t parrot the official global liberal order propaganda chapter and verse). Their contribution is a cartoonishly over-the-top piece of pants-wetting hysteria entitled “The Kremlin’s Trojan Horses.” This remarkable piece of neo-McCarthyist claptrap identifies every populist political movement in Europe as a secret agent of Russian influence on the continent, working in the interest of evil-arch-overlord-of-everything, Adolf Beelzebub Putin. The pamphlet not only points the finger of accusation at the usual suspects in the traditional far-right spaces (Le Pen’s National Front, PEGIDA, etc.) but also at Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party and, bizarrely, former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder.

Combined with the recent attempt to demonize any and all alternative media on the internet as “fake news” and/or “Russian propaganda,” there can be no doubt that the very out-of-touch political elite that Münchau is writing about are not just stumbling toward their Marie Antoinette moment, but pole-vaulting toward it. Evidently they believe that heavy-handed censorship will re-direct people back to the very establishment mouthpiece media that has recently set records for distrust among the public. They couldn’t be more wrong.

Yes, the global liberal order as envisioned by the banksters and their puppet politicians is collapsing. And yes, it is going to be messy, chaotic and violent. But you have to admit it will be entertaining to watch. Perhaps the people will have their cake and eat it too, after all.",conspiracy,C00a09,nwo; pizzagate
464,"QAnon: The conspiracy theory explained, after Q posters spotted at Trump's Florida rally

""Q"" signs at President Trump's Florida rally aren't a new slogan for the administration, but rather a conspiracy theory that grew out of comments on an anonymous message board last year.

""Q"" is a reference to QAnon, a group of people attempting to decode vague, anonymous comments posted on dark web message boards such as 4chan and 8chan. It's also been called ""The Storm"" and linked to conspiracy theory Pizzagate, that prompted a 28-year-old man to open fire inside a D.C. pizza shop.

Joseph Uscinski, a University of Miami professor who has been studying conspiracy theories for decades, told USA TODAY people who follow QAnon are typically ""Trump supporters who have a strong conspiracy mentality and are probably evangelical.""

Here's what you should know about QAnon:

What is it?

A user named ""Q"" began posting messages on the dark web in October of 2017, The Guardian reports. Q is reportedly a person working in the nation's energy department who has a top secret clearance. QAnon is the community of people trying to understand the meaning of Q's messages.

What do followers believe?

It's difficult to say. ""Q"" claims to know about a large child sex trafficking ring within the government, or ""deep state,"" Uscinski notes. This user has also posted claims saying Hillary Clinton, and John McCain, are wearing ankle monitors and Clinton and former president Obama are under investigation, New York Magazine reports.

Roseanne Barr has expressed support for QAnon through tweets, referencing in since-deleted messages the ""untold story"" of ""pedophile rings,"" The Washington Post notes, as well as requesting QAnon to direct message her.

Former Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling has expressed interest, sharing a YouTube video about the theory in June. Anti-abortion activist Cheryl Sullenger also has shared Q's messages.

Conspiracy theorist and radio host Alex Jones featured Q in a December 2017 show, but has since distanced himself from the movement.

""Even Alex Jones is very skeptical, Uscinski said. ""So, that tells you something.""

Inside Florida State Fairgrounds' Expo Hall Tuesday night, Q posters and shirts peppered the crowd chanting ""fake news"" and ""build the wall."" While QAnon followers have been a part of public events in the past, this sighting is making QAnon more mainstream. It was the group's ""real coming-out party,"" Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan notes.

Wayne Rooney struck in the final minute to seal a 2-0 victory for United. But Ferguson was not smiling for long. A slice of pizza thrown from the Arsenal dressing room sailed over the head of then Gunners defender Ashley Cole and hit Ferguson full in the face. Cesc Fabregas has since been accused of being the bad loser. Cole said: “The slap echoed down the tunnel and everything stopped – the fighting, the yelling.

1075,"Fake news websites lead to real life dangers such as ‘Pizzagate’

Why is media literacy an important skill?

Concern over the spread of fake news has grown since the election, when a number of false reports — often containing negative stories about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and positive ones about her opponent Donald Trump — were circulated widely through social media.

A popular Washington, D.C. pizza place became a recent target for online conspiracy theorists. Comet Ping Pong’s owner was accused of harboring victims of child abuse in collaboration with Clinton and members of her campaign staff. A man claiming he wanted to “self-investigate” the conspiracy known as “Pizzagate” showed up at the restaurant with an assault rifle last week before surrendering to police.

Both Facebook and Google say they are working to stem the spread of fake news on their respective internet platforms, but the sheer scale of the problem makes it difficult.

Distrust of government and mainstream media are part of what drives conspiracies like these, says Washington Post reporter Marc Fisher.

Some of the websites that produce fake news are created by entrepreneurs in countries such as Macedonia, where many of the writers are teenagers hoping to make money off of advertising revenue on the websites.

“There is a profit that can be made by taking something, however fantastic or incredible, and putting it out there in such a way that it goes viral, and then all of that web traffic, all of those clicks … translate into dollars,” Fisher said.

184,"Prince William recently warned that the population growth in Africa is putting a tremendous amount of pressure on the natural world and driving many species of animals to extinction.

“Africa’s rapidly growing human population is predicted to more than double by 2050 – a staggering increase of three and a half million people per month,” Prince William explained during a recent event hosted by the Tusk Trust, a charity that is committed to protecting African wildlife. “There is no question that this increase puts wildlife and habitat under enormous pressure.”

According to The Telegraph, Prince William continued, “Urbanization, infrastructure development, cultivation – all good things in themselves, but they will have a terrible impact unless we begin to plan and to take measures now.” He added, “We are going to have to work much harder, and think much deeper, if we are to ensure that human beings and the other species of animal with which we share this planet can continue to co-exist.”

For many, the Duke of Cambridge’s words serve as a stark reminder of what his grandfather once said decades ago: That in order to curb population growth, we may have to resort to “voluntary family limitation.” Others who are too young to remember his grandfather may recall his father, who himself was a staunch environmentalist. In 2006, for example, Prince William’s father warned that the people of earth only had 96 months to save the planet before “irretrievable climate and ecosystem collapse, and all that goes with it.”

Needless to say, the idea of population control and limitations being placed on how many children women are allowed to give birth to runs contrary to the values of liberty and individualism that America was founded upon. For that reason, it is an idea that should be (and for the most part, is) rejected in the United States as well as dozens of other countries throughout the world.

While it may not be one of the most pressing issues in American politics today, population control and eugenics has unfortunately been embedded in our society for decades thanks primarily to the progressive left. Most of the time, they have sneaky ways of getting the American people on board with the idea without actually making direct calls for population control. Other times they are more direct and upfront about what it is that they want to accomplish.

One open supporter of eugenics was Margaret Sanger, the original founder of the pro-abortion organization Planned Parenthood. Sanger was actually quite candid about her support for abortion as a means of controlling the population, and what’s equally as shocking is how the liberals have ignored this rather dark and evil history of Planned Parenthood for decades.",conspiracy,C039ba,pizzagate; planned.parenthood; population.control
1227,"Just when it looked like investigative journalism was dead and buried, there came along PizzaGate, which is busting open a new era of cyber-sleuthing to expose and take down once-untouchable criminals in high office. This most heartening rebirth, with the surge by a vigilant posse of blogs and websites, is accomplishing what the late Aaron Swartz of reddit (prior to its new role as self-appointed censor) was attempting before he was cut down in his tracks with an assisted suicide ordered by murderous pedophiles.

 

 The damning evidence gathered so far against the powerful Podesta brothers, who ran the Hillary for America campaign and served as advisers to Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton is crucial to demolishing the corrupt and unrepresentative Democratic National Committee and its bedfellows among so-called establishment Republicans. The foolhardy response of those high-level felons is to order an illegal cover-up and unconstitutional crackdown by Americas law-enforcement agencies, intelligence bureaus and NATO allies with the pretext of combating fake news.

 

 Caught with their pants down, the panicked perverts in power, from the Bilderbergers who denied association with pimp Marc Dutroux to the predators of the Franklin child-abuse scandal, now dare to accuse truth-tellers of running fake news in a lame attempt to scare off angry fathers who want answers to why missing kids are outnumbering milk cartons at the supermarket. The next line of defense for the cowardly political class is to plant cookies from their own hastily assembled fake sites as if their crumbs are IEDs.

 

 None of those namby-pamby tactics, like speaking in code words derived from pizza terminology, have deterred the online anti-pedophile crusaders, so the idiotic clandestine-ops bosses had to stage a phony lone-gunman attack on Comet Ping Pong Pizza. The assailant turned out to be an unemployed movie actor-writer named Edgar Madisson Welch, who previously appeared in the horror movie The Bleeding and worked as go-fer for A Tale about Bootlegging. This pathetic a ploy is yet another waste of newsprint and taxpayers money.

 

 The trans-Atlantic war on fake news, as documented on the European side of the pond by Thierry Meyssan of Voltaire network, had to have been ordered by the Office of the President or it simply wouldnt be involving NATO command, which has nothing better to do, for example, fighting the cutthroats of ISIS.

 

 Instead of being the Mini-me of that criminal dictator Suharto from your Indonesian boyhood days, Barry, grow up and act like a real man for once in your life. And get ready for more stench out of the overflowing the sewer pipe, you own next time. Instead of trying to plug the streaming flow of facts, youd better prepare for a safe retirement where you can feel at home, somewhere like Kenya. Never mind trying to protect Hillary and the Podestas, because they smoked their own chicken at Cheryl Mills Moloch Barbecue. 

 

 That White House email, now available for all to see at Wikileaks, promised Hillary Clinton a sacrifice to that ancient Canaanite idol, knowing full well that its not KFC and that the bull-headed demon demands burnt offerings with a child sacrifice. In this case, it may not be a metaphor, as will be explored later in this essay.

 

 Scotland Yard stares across the Atlantic

 

 One of the patently false claims from Hillarys occult crackpots is that Trump supporters concocted the accusations against Podesta. Excuse me for raising inconvenient truths, but this entire episode was started by the London Metropolitan Police in 2013. Back then, Trump supporters did not yet exist, except at the Miss Universe contest.

 

 As reported by ABC News in a video clip online, Scotland Yard released police artist sketches from witness accounts of two men who were spotted stalking the Portuguese vacation apartment where Madeleine McCann was abducted while her parents were away at a tapas restaurant. A bouncer at a tourist bar, along with other locals, recognized the pair as being Americans. Police notices are routinely filed with Interpol and, therefore, the FBI was obligated to run a facial-recognition check on the drawings.

 

 Only three years later, starting this autumn, did whispers emerge that the two depicted suspects have a stunning resemblance to beefy Tony Podesta and brother John with the sad eyes. According to yet-unverified leaks from law enforcement, the Podestas were in Praia do Luz, southern Portugal, on the very day of 4-year-old Maddies disappearance in that seaside town. May 3, 2007, a date to remember. 

 

 Freuds Tavistock as forerunner of MK-ULTRA

 

 In Praia do Luz, the brothers stayed in the plush villa of Clement Freud, a British TV personality and parliamentarian who was accused postmortem of being an insatiable pedophile. His grandfather was psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, founder of the Tavistock Institute in London. That psychiatric research lab developed the theory of sexual pleasure behind the sadistic methods adopted by the CIAs MK-ULTRA mind-control assassination program (which are described in the Jason Bourne movies).

 

 Immediately after Maddie was nabbed, the Podestas flew to Oxford, for some yet undisclosed meeting, perhaps to thank Clement for the hospitality in Portugal and to arrange the more complicated flight to the US, where there are strict immigration controls over children traveling without a parent or legal guardian.

 

 Following Clement Freudss death in 2009, the British press carried accounts of several women, exposing him as a sexual predator of underage girls. At the BBC, Freud was a close friend of Jimmy Savile, the head of an organized pedophile ring.

 

 Clements son Matthew Freud owns Britains most influential publicity company called Freuds, formerly Freud Communications. In an obvious giveaway, Freud hired the McCanns spokesman, thereby muzzling their demand for a wider police probe.

 

 Matthew Freud, until a recent divorce, was married to Elizabeth Murdoch, the daughter of Rupert. Her grandmother was Jewish, and the publishing empire News Corp. and The Australian are financed by the NM Rothschild Bank. Freud is a confidant of Lord Jacob Rothschild, David Cameron, Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson. In a step toward truthfulness in advertising, Freud should rename his PR firm as Frauds.

 

 Podestas Girl Friday is a Rothschild watchdog

 

 Now get this: Matthews former ace at Freud Communications, Sara Latham, was on the White House staff of Bill Clinton, a consultant to the Clinton Foundation and Microsoft, and she is the Chief of Staff for Podesta Associates and his liaison staffer to the Hillary for America campaign. Latham is the Rothschild watchdog over Podesta, the Clintons and the Democratic Party leadership. She is also a mentor to Chelsea Clinton.

 

 Why then should anyone be surprised that Rothschild Bank has just set up its new U.S. headquarters in Chicago, the Podestas hometown now run by Mayor Rahm Emanuel? The Rothschilds are managing Bayers takeover of Monsanto and selling off the Green Giant division of General Mills. Not that any of this lucrative business would ever be blocked under the globalist trade regime in a belated response to the Rothschild dynastys role in provoking the British imperial aggression against the United States in the War of 1812 and the Civil War, which killed untold thousands of Americans and caused the burning of the White House. If your clan hates American democracy and openness so much, then why dont you Rothschilds just stay out?

 

 Payoff for the Portuguese caper

 

 Now heres the capper: In spring 2007 immediately before departing to Portugal to fetch a prize, Tony Podesta had purchased a 7-bath house with swimming pool in the Kalorama area of Washington D.C. for a mere $3.9 million. At exactly the same moment, for a cool $1.7 million, James Achilles Alefantis (the owner-operator of Comet Ping Pong Pizza) and his partner James Brock, the anti-Trump editor of Media Matters attack site, bought a 6-bedroom rowhouse in the same neighborhood as Podesta. That amounts to a pile of pepperoni, paesani.

 

 A few years later, in early 2012, while the British police were starting to trace the Maddie McCann kidnapping to America, David Brock paid an out-of-court settlement of $850,000 to an ex-lover named William Grey, who threatened to tell all to law enforcement authorities. To raise the money to silence what he called blackmail, Brock sold his house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, at huge profit for more than $1 million to a realtor in McLean, Virginia, where coincidentally the CIA Langley headquarters is located. Oddly, the new owner tore down the valuable house but did not erect another structure, leaving the expensive lot empty. So that raises the obvious question: Were their little bodies buried below the basement?

 

 Until their recent separation, Alefantis and Brock operated the now-infamous Comet Ping Pong Pizza in the Chevy Chase area of Washington D.C., near the Maryland state line. Comet is the favorite hangout of in-house lawyers and staffers from the Center for American Progress, founded by John Podesta and funded by George Soros and Bill Gates. A pizza parlor is a public place that cannot be readily used as a crash pad for teenage boys. Chickens are taken home to roost, as inside 7-bathroom mansions with a heated pool where they can cavort without a lot of clothing before retiring to one of the bedrooms.

 

 The upmarket for children

 

 The next obvious question: When you have so much chicken in your backyard, why fly to Portugal for an English bird? This paradoxical point raises the many purposes and functions of pedophilia other than immediate gratification from young flesh.

 

 In the closet of pedophilia as in a classroom, children are graded on their merits. Rowdy young lads will never get past being fresh meat for the gay bathhouses. Smarter ones with neat habits can be assigned as Senate pages, if they show some eagerness to please the powerful patricians despite the bad body odor and flaky skin of old age, for example, Dennis Hastert congressional leader from, here once again, Illinois. And the utterly useless kids just might be given to a cult for an upcoming sexual rite and a blood feast served up by one of Fat Tonys favorite artist and chief torturer Marina Abramovic. 

 

 Then, at the top of the class are those exceptionally talented students with charismatic appeal, who are ideal as future movie stars or even might make a fine-looking president. Although by no means smart at math or homework, as an example, little Barry had an appealing smile and knitted his brow so cutely when he was serious. Athletic as a boy and mild as a girl, he was irresistible and therefore electable.

 

 Since looks can be deceiving, and the ruling elite is mindlessly superstitious, natal astrology is the basis for predicting future prospects. In the case of Barack Obama, born allegedly in Honolulu on August 4, 1962, the birth signs are Sun in Leo (charismatic leadership); Aquarius ascending (visionary); Moon in Gemini (a dual emotional-sexual nature); and Uranus (inciter of rebellion). Remember Change, the revolution that birthed the Arab Spring and ISIS? That come out of Uranus.

 

 Signs of a shaman-queen

 

 Next, Madeleine McCann. Before gazing at her planets, lets look at the lineage. Her fathers a physician and medical researcher (intelligent with focus on the corporeal). She is of Scottish descent, and the core cultural group in the USA is Scots-Irish. Now with a heads up: Sun in Taurus (strong and durable as an ox Moloch and the Minotaur); Libra ascending (balanced judgment, just desserts); Moon in Libra; and her dominants are Venus (desirable, sensual); Jupiter (power) and Mars (aggressive).

 

 This astrological combination of power and sexual attractiveness indicates that this little girl snatched from Praia do Luz can easily become the high priestess of a mystery cult or a respected political leader. Which is why the Controllers of the Cabal were willing to spend millions on acquiring her to establishing an enduring realm for the Illuminati. By the way, her point of departure, Praia do Luz translates as shore of light, auspicious for the Prince of Light, Lucifer.

 

 The cult option would probably be something like the present-day Minoans, the worshipers of sexual power as symbolized by the Minotaur and the Cretan priestesses. Their rites are head underground in Crete, where Hillary Clinton spent time after her Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens was violated and blood-sacrificed in Benghazi, the North African soil of Baal Hammon, the Carthaginian Moloch.

 

 Theres huge political potential for the woman president who completes the feminization of American society, transforming the once-macho nation into an androgynous matriarchy, which is the goal of more radical feminists and other advocates of demasculation.

 

 Rescuing the abducted

 

 If shes still alive, Madeleine McCann, along with the tens of thousands of child captives like her around the world, must be rescued, by force as required, from their Illuminati captors. Instead of being protected by U.S. law enforcement and the intelligence agencies pretending that the facts are fake, the Podestas should be arrested, robustly debriefed and sentenced to minimum of life with hard labor, perhaps tossing pizzas on death row.

 

 These sorts of grotesque violations of human rights will not end until the secretive cabal including and surrounding the Rothschilds, Freuds, Goldsmiths and other Illuminati filth are confined to a remote prison without parole or possibility of escape, inside a retirement home like Devils Island. If justice is not served, then the alternative solution will have to be more like the outcome in Blade, the Wesley Snipes ninja epic, or Selene of Underworld. Law or action, take your pick.

 

 This new Dark Age of captivity under demonic spells cause the deadly Ghostship cult fire that swept through a crowded Oakland warehouse. These sorts of felonies are not simply legal lapses of a secular nature. There are laws that apply to religion-related practices under the moral injunction that in civilized societies no preacher or cult leader is permitted to subject other humans to physical harm. This principle of law and ethics was incontrovertibly and irrevocably decreed in the 5th Century CE by the brilliant philosopher Saint Augustine, the Bishop of Hippo in Roman Africa. Forceful arrest by the state is ethically allowable to protect the weak, the helpless, the naive and ignorant.

 

 His ethical-legal ruling signaled the beginning of the end for an era of pagan horrors under superstitious despots and heralded the age of voluntary and reasoned consent by citizens. We either stand with the rule of lawful reason or kneel in fear as abject slaves. Mothers, make your choice and take your stand, and fathers do what you must to protect the children from sadistic oppressors.

 

 For parting shot about fake news, here's an email from a staffer at the Sandler Foundation to John Podesta, who dropped something from his back pocket:

 ""Hi, John. The realtor found a handkerchief. I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yours? They can send it if you want. I know youre busy so feel free not to respond if it's not yours or you don't want it.

 Podesta replied: It's mine.

 

 How can anyone ever eat pizza again?

1269,"resident Donald Trump’s latest remarks about the clashes in Charlottesville, Va., drew praise on Tuesday from white supremacists after Trump said “both sides” were to blame for the violence.

“Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa,” former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke wrote on Twitter.

Trump on Tuesday described anti-racism protesters as the “alt-left” and said “there’s blame on both sides.” “You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent, and nobody wants to say that, but I’ll say it right now,” Trump said Tuesday in a press conference at Trump Tower.

On Monday, Trump condemned white supremacists and called racism “evil.” But that response — which came nearly 48 hours after the violence in Charlottesville — was dismissed by many white supremacists. “He sounded like a Sunday school teacher. I just don’t take him seriously,” white nationalist Richard Spencer told reporters on Monday, according to HuffPost. “It sounded so hollow and vapid.”

Spencer praised Trump’s comments on Tuesday. “Trump’s statement was fair and down to earth. #Charlottesville could have been peaceful, if police did its job,” Spencer said on Twitter, adding: “I’m proud of him for speaking the truth.”

Eli Mosley, one of the organizers of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, told a HuffPost reporter that he felt Trump’s remarks showed he was supporting them.

“The madman President Trump was on the campaign has returned. He has returned, and he is out — he is going on offense. Everybody knows it. Everybody knows how the information environment just changed,” said alt-right activist Jack Posobiec, known for promoting the false “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory. “Take a bow. Take a bow, President Trump, because you just earned it.”

Trump’s remarks, meanwhile, quickly drew criticism from both Republicans and Democrats.

“We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive,” Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Twitter. “This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity.”",mainstream,M19ef8,pizzagate
1139,"Late on Sunday, after returning to his hotel room on a trip away from home, Mark Zuckerberg made a decision he had hoped to avoid.

For weeks, the Facebook chief executive and his colleagues had debated what to do about Infowars, the notorious far-right news site, and Alex Jones, Infowars' choleric founder, who became famous for his spittle-flecked rants and far-fetched conspiracies, including the idea that the Sandy Hook massacre was an elaborate hoax promoted by gun-control supporters.

Mr. Jones is just one Facebook user out of 2.2 billion, but he had become symbolic of tech platforms' inconsistency and reluctance to engage in a misinformation war.

The pressure on Facebook to do something about him had intensified after executives gave a series of vague and confusing answers to lawmakers and reporters about the company's policies. Misinformation was allowed to stay on the platform, they said, but hate speech wasn't. So users dug up and reported old Infowars posts, asking for their removal on the grounds that they glorified violence and contained dehumanizing language against Muslims, immigrants, and transgender people.

These posts clearly violated Facebook's hate speech rules. And in a normal situation, a low-level content moderator might have reviewed them, found that they qualified, and taken them down.

But Mr. Jones was no typical internet crank. He has millions of followers, a popular video show, and the ear of President Trump — who once told the provocateur that his reputation was ""amazing."" Banning such a prominent activist would lead to political blowback, no matter how justified the action was.

The situation was volatile enough that Mr. Zuckerberg got personally engaged, according to two people involved in Facebook's handling of the accounts. He discussed Infowars at length with other executives, and mused privately about whether Mr. Jones — who once called Mr. Zuckerberg a ""genetic-engineered psychopath"" in a video — was purposefully trying to get kicked off the platform to gain attention, they said.

Mr. Zuckerberg, an engineer by training and temperament, has always preferred narrow process decisions to broad, subjective judgments. His evaluation of Infowars took the form of a series of technical policy questions. They included whether the mass-reporting of Infowars posts constituted coordinated ""brigading,"" a tactic common in online harassment campaigns. Executives also debated whether Mr. Jones should receive a ""strike"" for each post containing hate speech (which would lead to removing his pages as well as the individual posts) or a single, collective strike (which would remove the posts, but leave his pages up).

Late Sunday, Apple — which has often tried to stake out moral high ground on contentious debates — removed Infowars podcasts from iTunes. After seeing the news, Mr. Zuckerberg sent a note to his team confirming his own decision: the strikes against Infowars and Mr. Jones would count individually, and the pages would come down. The announcement arrived at 3 a.m. Pacific time.

Tech Companies Banned Infowars. Now, Its App Is Trending.

In the days that followed, other platforms — YouTube, Pinterest, MailChimp, and more — said they, too, were banning Infowars. The notable exception was Twitter, which decided not to ban the site or Mr. Jones. The company's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, tweeted a veiled shot at the way his rivals handled the situation.

""We're going to hold Jones to the same standard we hold to every account, not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term, and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories,"" he said.

Now, cut off from most of his audience, Mr. Jones will have to chart a new course. He has already stepped enthusiastically into a role as a free-speech martyr. (After the ban took effect, Infowars slapped a ""censored"" label on its videos and launched a ""forbidden information"" marketing campaign.) And conservatives — and even some free-speech advocates on the left — worried that social media companies may be entering a new, censorious era. Senator Ted Cruz, the Republican from Texas, paraphrased the famous Martin Niemöller poem about German accommodation of Nazism: ""First, they came for Alex Jones.""

Social media executives have a history of going to great lengths to assuage fears of anti-conservative bias, and this week was no exception. On Thursday, Richard Allan, a Facebook vice president of policy, published a blog post about the company's commitment to free speech. With the exception of violent threats and hate speech, he wrote, ""we lean toward free expression. It's core to both who we are and why we exist."" Mr. Dorsey also appeared on Sean Hannity's radio show, where he gave reassurances that Twitter does not discriminate against conservatives.

Slippery-slope fears about mass censorship by social media platforms are probably overblown. For starters, Infowars presented an unusual case because of its size, the extreme nature of its content and the ferocity of Mr. Jones's critics. Mr. Zuckerberg does not have time to adjudicate every dispute over hate speech on Facebook, nor does he want to.

In fact, taking action against Infowars could allow social media giants to avoid future conflicts over extreme content by setting a new, hard-to-beat standard for unacceptable toxicity. (""Yes, Jewhater McRacist is bad,"" they may say, ""but he's no Alex Jones."") Many other internet conspiracists have learned how to tiptoe to the edge of platforms' rules without breaking them — speaking in code about Pizzagate, for example, or saying things like ""I'm not saying he's a crisis actor, but if he were …""

One lesson Mr. Zuckerberg has taken from the Infowars saga, said the people involved in the handling of Mr. Jones's Facebook accounts, is that the social network's policies are overly complex and need to be simplified. Privately, company officials have also downplayed the Infowars bans, saying they don't represent a watershed moment in the online free speech debate, but are rather a matter of how to enforce Facebook's existing policies.

This is a convenient narrative, of course, from a company that would rather haggle over terms of service than discuss the power and governance of its platform.

There are legitimate questions, still unanswered, about what to do about the huge, unaccountable corporations that control large pieces of our modern communications infrastructure. Both fans and critics of Infowars can probably agree that a system in which one executive can decide to shut off a news organization's access to a large portion of its audience is hardly ideal.

There are also valid questions about why Infowars got so popular in the first place, and whether attention-maximizing platforms like Facebook and YouTube are designed in way so that people like Mr. Jones are incentivized to push the boundaries of acceptable speech.

After all, these platforms didn't just host Infowars content for those who were seeking it — they actively promoted it to millions of people for years, through algorithmic feeds and recommendation engines that decide which videos to show you next. Could these platforms be redesigned so that the next Alex Jones never gets that kind of boost, and remains on the ideological fringes?

These questions will have to wait. For now, tech leaders seem satisfied to have dealt with their Infowars problems, at least temporarily. They will return to their defensive crouch, hiding their power behind policies, making small changes under pressure, and hoping that nobody notices the size of their footprints.",mainstream,M18fd5,pizzagate
1213,"Over the past two years, a key event many bears have cited as a potential catalyst for the next market crash, is the systematic downgrade of billions of lowest-rated investment grade bonds to junk as a result of debt leverage creeping ever high, coupled with the inevitable slowdown of the economy, which would lead to an avalanche of “fallen angels” – newly downgraded junk bonds which institutional managers have to sell as a result of limitations on their mandate, in the process sending prices across the corporate sector sharply lower.

As we discussed in July, the scope of this potential problem is massive, with the the lowest-rated, BBB sector now nearly 60% of all investment grade bonds, and more than double the size of the entire junk bond market in the US, and 3.4x bigger than the European junk bond universe.

Yet after waiting patiently for years for the inevitable downgrade avalanche which would unleash a zombie army of fallen angels and potentially spark the next crash, with the occasional exception of a few notable downgrades such as PG&E and Ford, this wholesale event has failed to materialize so far, something which the bulls have frequently paraded as an indication that the economy is far stronger than the bears suggest.

But is it? And instead of the economy being stronger, are we just reliving the past where rating agencies pretended everything was ok until the very end, only to admit they were wrong all along, and then slash their rating retrospectively, too late however as the next financial crisis is already raging.

Well, according to a must-read expose by the WSJ, it appears that we are indeed doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past, because as the Journal’s Gunjan Banerji and Cezary Podkul observe, what was supposed to be a 2015 downgrade has dragged on for over 4 years… while the rating agencies appear to be purposefully looking elsewhere….",conspiracy,C06b4e,pizzagate

WASHINGTON (AP) — For conspiracy theorists, the bizarre rumors of “pizzagate” didn’t end when a man brought a gun to a Washington restaurant this week in a misguided attempt to rescue nonexistent child sex slaves. Instead, the shooting sparked discussion that the conspiracy runs deeper.

On blogs, YouTube channels and internet radio shows devoted to conspiracy theories, the arrest of Edgar Maddison Welch on Sunday was just the latest “false flag,” a term for a cover-up or distraction orchestrated by the government or other powerful figures. The persistent belief in the false-flag theory shows just how stubborn fabricated conspiracies can be, according to experts.

According to police, Welch drove to a restaurant called Comet Ping Pong to investigate the “pizzagate” rumors that Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, and other Washington insiders were harboring child sex slaves there. Police said Welch fired several shots inside the pizzeria on Sunday with a military-style rifle but surrendered peacefully after he found no evidence of a secret pedophilia ring.

There’s no evidence to back up the rumors about the restaurant, a beloved neighborhood institution in the wealthy enclave of Chevy Chase. In the past year, Comet employees have reported a damaged car, a stolen bag and online harassment; otherwise, it’s never been the subject of a police investigation.

But to true believers, the absence of proof is just another sign of a conspiracy and a well-orchestrated cover-up.

James Fetzer, a longtime conspiracy theorist who also believes the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax, told The Associated Press that Welch’s visit to the pizzeria was staged to distract the public from the truth of the “pizzagate” allegations.

“There’s no doubt about it in my mind,” said Fetzer, a former philosophy professor and the founder of a group called Scholars for 9/11 Truth. “You see, this is part of the whole idea to smear the alternative media, which are putting out so much more truth than the mainstream.”

Welch — a fitfully employed, 28-year-old father of two from North Carolina — is being held without bail. He told The New York Times in a jailhouse interview that he “just wanted to do some good and went about it the wrong way.”

Once a conspiracy theory gains traction, confronting true believers with facts is pointless, said Michael Barkun, a professor emeritus at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School and the author of “A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America.”

“When you get to conspiracy theories like this, they’re closed systems of ideas,” Barkun said. “They’re constructed in such a way that there isn’t any evidence you can present to someone who believes them that will lead a believer to change his or her mind.”

“Pizzagate” believers point out references to pizza in Podesta’s hacked emails, which were published by WikiLeaks, and Comet owner James Alefantis’ ties to Democratic donors. They scour Alefantis’ social-media posts and even his restaurant’s menu for “code words” and “symbols” that supposedly reference child sexual abuse. They jump to incredible conclusions based on Podesta’s and Alefantis’ tastes in art.

Fetzer and other conspiracy theorists seized on the fact that Welch had dabbled in movie acting as a giveaway that his visit to the restaurant was staged. Welch wrote a short film and appeared as a victim in a slasher movie alongside a friend, Kathy Sue Holtorf, who told the AP that Welch “never wanted to become an actor.”

Blogger Joachim Hagopian, a false-flag proponent, told the AP that conspirators look for “a patsy or stooge” to pose as a lone gunman with an assault rifle. Welch, he said, “fits the pattern” with his acting background.

“He’s got an IMDB (Internet Movie Database) profile,” Hagopian said.

Conspiracy theorists have made similar claims about parents of the 20 children who were killed at Sandy Hook in Newtown Connecticut, in 2012, calling them “crisis actors” pretending to grieve for nonexistent children. Sandy Hook was a false flag meant to promote gun control, the conspiracy theorists said. Just this week, a Florida woman was charged with threatening the parent of a child who died in the shooting because she thought the attack was a hoax, according to federal authorities.

The ultimate false flag in modern times, according to conspiracy theorists, was Sept. 11, 2001. Some believe the World Trade Center towers were destroyed by the government, using bombs or other means, as part of a plot to justify the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Hagopian said he believes attacks since then — including the mass shootings last year in San Bernardino, California, and this year at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida — also were false flags.

Hillary Clinton has been linked by conspiracy theorists to child sex abuse since the mid-1990s, Barkun said. Andrew Breitbart, the late founder of right-wing site Breitbart News — later led by President-elect Donald Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen Bannon — tweeted in 2011 that Podesta was a “world class underage sex slave op cover-upper.”

Radio host and Trump supporter Alex Jones, a well-known conspiracy theorist, said in a YouTube video Sunday that he believes the claims about powerful Democrats abusing children, but he wasn’t convinced Comet Ping Pong had anything to do with it.

“The big bug zapper to distract all the investigators is the D.C. pizza place,” Jones said.

The video was deluged by comments criticizing Jones for backing away from the “pizzagate” story.

Conspiracy theories can help believers process genuinely horrific news, such as child sex abuse scandals involving the Catholic Church or Penn State University, said James Broderick, an English professor at New Jersey City University and the co-author of “Web of Conspiracy: A Guide to Conspiracy Theory Sites on the Internet.”

“Having a targeted source of villainy creates, in some people’s minds, a feeling of control,” Broderick said. “Evil isn’t random. It’s a result of these nameable forces that we can target.”",mainstream,M18fe3,pizzagate
51,"The bizarre rumours began with a leaked email referring to Hillary Clinton and sinister interpretations of pizza parties. It morphed into fake online news stories about a child sex trafficking ring run by prominent Democrats operating out of a Washington, D.C., restaurant.

On Sunday, it culminated in violence when police say a North Carolina man fired an assault rifle inside the Comet Ping Pong restaurant as he attempted to ""self-investigate"" the conspiracy theory known in the Twitterverse as ""Pizzagate.""

No one was hurt and the man was arrested. But the shooting alarmed those from neighbouring businesses all the way to the White House about the real life dangers of fake news on the internet. One of those people posting on the conspiracy theory is the son of president-elect Donald Trump's proposed national security adviser.
• Google says it will crack down on fake news sites
• Only Facebook knows how it spreads fake election news

There is no physical evidence of this trafficking ring, no police investigation and no victims have come forward.

On Monday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest, when asked about the shooting, said, ""There's no denying the corrosive effect that some of these false reports have had on our political debate, and that's concerning in a political context. It's deeply troubling that some of those false reports could lead to violence.""

Edgar Maddison Welch, 28 of Salisbury, N.C., was arrested Sunday afternoon outside the popular eatery in an affluent neighbourhood of the nation's capital, police said.

At his initial appearance Monday in D.C. Superior Court, Welch was ordered held pending a hearing scheduled for Thursday. The public defender he was assigned didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Court records made public Monday state Welch fired an AR-15 assault rifle multiple times inside the restaurant but later walked out with his hands up and unarmed, leaving his weapons inside. He told police ""he had read online that the Comet restaurant was harbouring child sex slaves and that he wanted to see for himself if they were there.""

He said he ""was armed to help rescue them"" and ""surrendered peacefully when he found no evidence that underage children were being harboured in the restaurant.""

Welch was charged with multiple counts, including assault with a dangerous weapon. Authorities recovered an AR-15 assault rifle and a handgun from the restaurant, court documents show. Police said an additional weapon was recovered from his vehicle.

One of Welch's friends told the Washington Post she doesn't think he intended to shoot anyone.

""He most likely really believes the conspiracy theory,"" said Kathy Sue Holtorf, 29, who lives in California and works as a film producer. ""He's a good guy with the best of intentions. He probably saw himself as more on a hero mission to save children than anything else.""

Holtorf produced a nine-minute short called Mute that was written by Welch and they both appeared as victims of vampires in a slasher movie. She said Welch dabbled, but ""never wanted to become an actor."" Holtorf described Welch as ""a well-educated man"" and ""not a conspiracy nut,"" saying he would talk about his daughters and how proud he was of them.

His aunt, Tajuana Tadlock, described Welch to the Washington Post as passionate and tenderhearted and a person who loves his family and his children. She said the family hasn't been able to talk to him so they don't know ""what got him to this level.""

""Maddison is a sweet young man with a big heart,"" said Tadlock. ""We are all in shock right now. We are still trying to get our minds around what happened. This is totally out of character for him.""

The precise origins of the conspiracy theory Welch said he went to investigate are murky, though it seems to have started gaining momentum in the week before the election.

Some elements trace back to hacked emails from Clinton Chief of Staff John Podesta that were released by WikiLeaks that refer to pizza parties, with online commentators speculating that ""pizza party"" is a code word for something more nefarious.

By Nov. 3, Comet Ping Pong — so named because patrons can play ping pong on tables in the back of restaurant — had been pulled into the conspiracy due to leaked emails between Podesta and Comet's owner, James Alefantis, where the pair discuss a party fundraiser held at the restaurant.
• Why we believe conspiracy theories
• Why the '9/11 Truth' movement endures 15 years later

""Let me state unequivocally: These stories are completely and entirely false, and there is no basis in fact to any of them. What happened today demonstrates that promoting false and reckless conspiracy theories comes with consequences,"" Alefantis said in a statement Sunday night.

At least one person who isn't ready to give up on the conspiracy theory is prominently connected to Trump's transition team.

Michael Flynn Jr. is an adviser to his father, Michael Flynn, whom Trump selected to serve as national security adviser. Flynn Jr. has posted numerous tweets about the Pizzagate conspiracy theories.
• Trump's defence pick should 'scare the daylights' out of the U.S. enemies

Flynn Jr., who has accompanied his father to presidential transition meetings inside Trump Tower and lists the presidential transition website as part of his Twitter bio, tweeted Sunday night that, ""Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story.""

Vice-president-elect Mike Pence said Flynn Jr. has no role in the president-elect's transition

The senior Flynn has also tweeted false stories about Clinton, including one linking her and her staff to sex crimes, an investigation by Politico has revealed.

On Monday, at an address listed for Welch in Salisbury, a woman drove out as a reporter was approaching and asked him to leave. She then hammered a ""no trespassing"" sign on a stand by the private driveway.

Comet Ping Pong was closed Monday, but neighbours brought flowers and cards to the storefront saying ""We support Comet"" and ""we love you and stand by you.""

Wiktoria Skrzypinska lives a few blocks from Comet. She said she had heard the rumours about Comet but was shocked to learn that somebody had become so enmeshed in the conspiracy theory to enter the restaurant with an assault rifle.

Of course, me writing all these words are actually completely unnecessary, because when you watch the promotional video Microsoft has produced to promote her, it’s lights out and case closed.

Microsoft is the company that funds Mark of the Beast digital identification company ID2020, and now they are promoting New Age witch Marina Abramovic who is best known for the satanic practice of spirit cooking. Is this really someone you would want to enter into holographic mixed reality with?

Isuppose you can get away with just about anything if you call yourself a ‘performance artist’ instead of what you actually are, in this case we are talking about a High Priestess of modern-day Satanism, Marina Abramovic. She is a wicked woman whose ‘performance art‘ usually revolves around snakes, pig’s blood, images of Baphomet, and all the rest of that garbage. But nothing to see her, people, Marina is just an ‘edgy performance artist’, that’s all. Yeah, right.

“And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.” 2 Chronicles 33:6 (KJB)

Take a look at an article published by the UCLA Center for European and Russian Studies back in 2018, where they calmly and rationally discussed the rise importance of witchcraft in Hollywood. It’s not simply enlightening, it’s a stunning eye-opener, and of course we see Marina Abramovic featured prominently in it.

But do your own research, we have done ours and are satisfied that Marina Abramovic is exactly who we think she is, a New Age witch who hides behind performance art to promote Satanism, witchcraft, and all the rest of her demonic nonsense. So with that, let’s take a look at what Microsoft, the same company who is finding ID2020 is doing with Abramovic. Of course, me writing all these words are actually completely unnecessary, because when you watch the promotional video Microsoft has produced to promote her, it’s lights out and case closed.

Now if you have half a brain, after everything we present to you here, the last place you want to be is in a virtual world with a New Age witch known for satanism, gore and cannibalism. But this is where evil end times company Microsoft wants to take you, don’t go.

FROM MICROSOFT: Marina Abramovic is likely the most acclaimed performance artist living today. Known for risky performances that push the limits of human endurance, it’s difficult to overstate her importance within the art world and pop culture at large.

From the 1970s through to the present, she has created dozens of incredibly impactful works that explore themes of courage, ego, endurance, and spirituality. In 2010, her iconic work The Artist Is Present, was the biggest exhibition at New York City’s MoMA ever. In the piece, she sat still for eight hours, every day, for nearly three months, sustaining eye contact with whomever sat across from her.

“Any medium—visual, aural, even material—is really just a conduit for the energy of the artist to reach the understanding of the audience. In mixed reality we’ve achieved the first medium capable of presenting a recorded performance as an event happening now,” says Todd. “The artist is forever, in this case, which changes the very nature of what the conduit means. But for the audience with The Life, it’s my hope that they never think about such things. Instead I want them to walk away feeling like they were just in the room with Marina.”

Marina’s most recent piece, The Life, further solidifies her unconventional and innovative approach to performance art—it’s her first artwork to harness mixed reality. Brought to life with the HoloLens 2, the 19-minute performance follows Abramović, whose phantom-like virtual image appears in a vibrant red dress as she explores the space and its borders. Viewers become mesmerized by her mindful movements, her virtual image dissolving as she interacts with the installation’s borders.

For the first time, viewers are able to experience performance art without boundaries—and without the artist technically being “present.” As soon as they don the HoloLens 2 headset, Abramović’s fully realized form takes shape before their eyes. READ MORE

If a picture says a thousand words, how many words is this video telling you? Watch and find out. But at the very least you will instantly see why we call her a New Age witch and a satanist, oops, sorry, performance artist.

The art market is one of the few bubbles that hasn’t popped yet – many will remember Maurizio Cattelan’s banana, taped to the wall at Art Basel Miami Beach in December, selling for $120,000 until someone plucked it off the wall and ate it – at which point it was replaced with another, higher-priced banana.

Abramovic’s performance work – transient by definition – is a little more difficult to sell, but Microsoft seemed to have nailed it down with the HoloLens thing. Add in the general bad feeling against Microsoft founder and world’s second-richest-man Bill Gates, who has been ubiquitous throughout the coronavirus epidemic pushing “digital certificates” and 18-month lockdowns as the answer to the virus, despite lacking a medical degree or any expertise in the field beyond the money he’s poured into mass vaccination campaigns, and the backlash becomes understandable.

Hashtags like #BillGatesIsNotYourFriend and #BillGatesPublicEnemyNumber1 have proliferated in recent weeks as many of the same researchers who probed Abramovic’s performance past have dug into Gates’ questionable statements in support of microchipping the world and the myriad apparent conflicts of interest between the companies he invests in and the global health causes he promotes. Given his track record, his stated goal of vaccinating seven billion people has also raised a few eyebrows.",conspiracy,C048b9,pizzagate
554,"LONDON (Reuters) - The highs of Arsene Wenger’s 18-year stint as Arsenal manager outweigh the lows, even if the club have failed to win a trophy for nine years.

Here is a look at the highlights and low points since he was appointed in 1996:

Wenger achieved a remarkable feat in his first full season in charge by winning the Premier League and FA Cup double.

They sealed the league title with a superb 4-0 win over Everton, with captain Tony Adams scoring the final goal in the final minute of the final home game of the season.

The double was completed two weeks later when they beat Newcastle United 2-0 in the FA Cup final at Wembley with goals from Marc Overmars and Nicolas Anelka.

One of the most extraordinary events in the long history of the FA Cup came about because of Wenger’s great sporting gesture following a fifth round tie against Sheffield United at Highbury in February 1999.

Arsenal’s winning goal in the 2-1 victory came after Arsenal’s Nwankwo Kanu took advantage of a throw-in awarded after United had put the ball in touch so one of their players could be treated for an injury.

Kanu played the ball to Overmars, who scored. But that goal, while perfectly legal, breached the convention of giving possession back to the opposition in such circumstances.

Wenger stepped in and offered to replay the game although he was under no obligation to do so and the FA accepted. Arsenal then won the replay by the same score.

Arsenal clinched the title in the penultimate game of the season at the home of their then-fiercest rivals Manchester United, Sylvain Wiltord scoring in a 1-0 win at Old Trafford on May 8, 2002. The defeat ended United’s own title hopes.

Four days earlier Arsenal had won the first leg of the double when they beat London rivals Chelsea 2-0 at Cardiff to win the FA Cup for the second time under Wenger with Ray Parlour and Freddie Ljungberg scoring.

Although they did not win the double again, this season represents the highlight of Wenger’s reign so far.

Arsenal became the first team since Preston North End 115 years previously to go through a league season unbeaten, but they failed to retain the FA Cup when they lost to Manchester United in the semi-final at Villa Park.

Their league record read: Played 38 Won 26, Drew 12, Lost 0 and they scored 73 goals, conceding only 26. They have not won the League since.

Their unbeaten league run lasted a record 49 games and ended in the October of the following season with a 2-0 defeat at, where else, Manchester United.

One of the great wins in Arsenal’s history came on February 21, 2006, when a Thierry Henry goal meant Arsenal beat Real Madrid 1-0 to become the first English team to beat the Spaniards at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium.

The assured, mature performance by an under-strength Arsenal

was enough to give them a 1-0 aggregate win in their Champions League first knockout round after a 0-0 draw at Highbury in the second leg.

They went on to beat Juventus and Villarreal before reaching the final against Barcelona in Paris where, despite having goalkeeper Jens Lehmann sent off early in the game, they took the lead through Sol Campbell but eventually lost 2-1.

Arsenal completed a miserable treble of penalty shoot-out defeats on May 17, 2000, when they lost 4-1 on penalties to Galatasaray of Turkey in the UEFA Cup final in Copenhagen.

Arsenal had gone out to both Leicester City in the League Cup and Middlesbrough in the FA Cup earlier in the season on penalties.

But they went to Copenhagen the strong favourites to win their first European trophy since lifting the European Cup Winners Cup in 1994.

In the event the match was a huge disappointment. After a goalless 120 minutes their only goal in the shootout came from Ray Parlour while Davor Suker and Patrick Vieira both missed.

To complete Arsenal’s misery, Galatasaray’s clincher was scored by Gheorghe Popescu, who used to play for their arch-rivals Tottenham Hotspur.

Arsenal have been hammered twice by United during Wenger’s reign. The first occurred on February 25, 2001 when United won 6-1 at Old Trafford in the Premier League with Dwight Yorke scoring a hat-trick in the opening 22 minutes.

He had put United ahead after two minutes before Thierry Henry equalised after 16 minutes.

Two more goals from Yorke, Roy Keane and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer put United 5-1 up by halftime while former Spurs favourite Teddy Sheringham completed the rout after coming on as a late substitute.

One of the most infamous matches under Wenger took place at Old Trafford on September 21, 2003 and ended with the points shared but reputations shattered.

Vieira was sent off for a foul on Ruud van Nistelrooy but did not leave the pitch quickly, confronting Van Nistelrooy and provoking a melee between the opposing players.

Van Nistelrooy subsequently missed a last-minute penalty which several Arsenal players celebrated in his face.

As the match ended two minutes later, brawls broke out involving Ashley Cole, Cristiano Ronaldo and others while Vieira and Van Nistelrooy resumed their hostilities in the tunnel.

If Van Nistelrooy had scored with the penalty, the “Invincibles” season would never have happened.

More mayhem at Old Trafford followed in October 2004 when Arsenal were beaten 2-0 by Manchester United to end their league record 49-match unbeaten run.

After the game United manager Alex Ferguson and Wenger continued to row over comments Wenger allegedly made about Van Nistelrooy.

As Ferguson wrote in an autobiography published last year, “Next thing I knew in the corridor I had pizza all over me.”

The pair did not speak to each other for five years but have since been on various panels together.

Arsenal have had by far the better record over arch-rivals Spurs under Wenger, but on January 22, 2008, Spurs finally beat Arsenal for the first time since 1999 with a thumping 5-1 win in the second leg of the League Cup semi-final at White Hart Lane.

The first leg had finished 1-1 at the Emirates but Spurs took control of the second leg with goals from Jermaine Jenas, an own goal from Niklas Bendtner and a third from Robbie Keane who made it 3-0 before halftime.

Aaron Lennon made it 4-0 before Emmanuel Adebayor, now at Spurs, pulled one back before Steed Malbranque completed the rout. Arsenal’s misery was compounded by Bendtner and Adebayor rowing with each other before the end of the match.

Arsenal’s worst defeat since 1896 raised huge question marks over Wenger’s future at the club and whether Arsenal were still a force to be reckoned with in the Premier League.

After three matches of the season, this August 2011 defeat left Arsenal 17th although they did recover to finish third.

On an afternoon of complete humiliation at Old Trafford, Arsenal were torn apart by a United team which won with a hat-trick from Wayne Rooney, two from Ashley Young, and other goals from Danny Welbeck, Nani and Park Ji-sung.

Theo Walcott and Robin van Persie scored for Arsenal, but Van Persie missed a penalty against the club he joined in 2012.",mainstream,M0fd76,pizzagate
175,"The United Nations, heavily subsidized by U.S. taxpayers’ dollars, has faced a widespread child sexual abuse problem for years and reacted with little more than silence.

EDITOR’S NOTE: Have you ever wondered why, after a disaster like a hurricane or a tsunami in a third-world or developing country, that so many “charitable organizations” like the UN and the Clinton Foundation rush to go there? It’s to help the victims, right? Wrong. It’s so they can go there and exploit them while they are helpless, with a special focus on the children. NTEB has spoken to numerous child sex trafficking prevention groups in Haiti who have told us that the main customers of child sex trafficking establishments are United States congressmen and senators. The United Nations “peacekeepers” are raping children around the world, and they are protected by the UN so they will never face trial. This is what YOUR tax dollars are funding. Just thought you’d like to know.

On February 28, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres confirmed that UN peacekeepers and civilian staff faced 145 allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse impacting on 311 victims in 2016 alone. There are nearly 40 cases so far in 2017. Many of the victims, by the UN’s own admission, are children.

As one 11-year-old child put it, “I didn’t have breasts yet, but he still raped me.” It is the one indefensible act. Child rape.

Even the UN recognises that these numbers, while huge, are likely to be the tip of the iceberg and represent only the crimes that have been reported, involving mainly just one part of the UN: Peacekeeping.

These numbers are a small proportion of the sex and child rape crimes committed by UN staff and peacekeepers over at least the last two decades.

Neither the sex scandals of the UN in the Bosnian War dramatized in the 2010 film Whistleblower nor the long-running “Food for Sex” scandals of the early 2000s. are covered in these figures. What is worse, decision makers have known this for years but have failed to crack down.

A Save the Children report over a decade ago found abuse at all age levels “from 8 to 18,” though the victims older than twelve were identified as being “regularly involved in ‘selling sex.’” The Save report went on to say that, among the children interviewed, “all of the respondents clearly stated that they felt that the scale of the problem affected over half of the girls in their locations.”

The outbreak of such heinous activity at the UN highlights just how vulnerable the victims are. Faced with legal safeguards in the United States and Western countries, evil men have found that it is easy to gain access to children in developing countries. People in power know this, so much so that since 1999 authorities have warned that problem of paedophiles in the aid world is on a level with sex tourism.

As Western countries have cracked down on paedophilia, many predatory paedophiles have targeted the developing world to find child victims. An easy way to gain access to children in the developing world is to join a children’s charity. It is disgusting, but logical once you are told.

UN officials know this, yet have failed to act decisively.

The UN uses legal and sovereign immunity claims to prevent prosecution. The UN chooses not to waive immunity and therefore uses this legal fiction to protect child rapists rather than the children.

For at least 20 years, the leadership of the UN has known and failed to effectively act. Former Secretary General Kofi Annan listed his failure to act on the paedophilia of UN staff in his ten years as Secretary General as one of his regrets, and immediate past Secretary General Ban Ki Moon has acknowledged not enough has been done.

People have been using soft words about paedophilia in the UN and large NGOs for decades. None of this is secret. None of this is surprising. But never has pressure been seriously applied for something to be done. The current Secretary General proposed a four-part strategy putting “the rights and dignity for victims at the forefront of UN efforts.”

“I fully recognize that no magic wand exists to end the problem of sexual exploitation and abuse,” Guterres said. “Nevertheless, I believe that we can dramatically improve how the United Nations addresses this scourge.”

“Dramatically improve” are weasel words. We should be stronger. We should stamp this out and we could start with the language.

For example, the UN used “sexual abuse” to describe the 14-year-old child, together with her 18-year-old friend, set upon by UN peacekeepers near Bambari Airport in Central African Republic late in 2015.

This is not “sexual abuse.” This is gang rape of a child. Call it for what it is.

Approximately 28 percent of UN peacekeeping operations, and a quarter of all UN operations, are funded by the United States’ taxpayer. The U.S. taxpayer is effectively funding child rape. By withholding funds, the United States could stop the rape, yet no previous U.S. government has had the courage to say “Stop, no more.” It is time the U.S. government put an end to this.

It is time the U.S. government said to the UN: “fix the problem.” If the UN does not fix it, then the US should stop funding it. U.S. taxpayers should not fund child rape. It is that simple. source",conspiracy,C05e05,pizzagate
527,"The FBI publication of January 31, 2007, (U) Symbols and Logos Used by Pedophiles to Identify Sexual Preferences, states:

“Pedophiles…are using various types of identification logos or symbols to recognize one another and distinguish their sexual preferences…. These symbols have been etched into rings and formed into pendants, and have also been found imprinted on coins.”

Below are the symbols for “boy lover”, “girl lover” and “child lover” pedophiles, according to the FBI:

 

 

 

 The FBI’s Symbols and Logos Used by Pedophiles furthermore states:

“Pedophilia symbols on jewelry, coins, Web sites and other effects are indicative of advertisement methods used by child sexual predators to promote their cause. Pedophile activists advocate for the social acceptance of sexual relationships between adults and children. These organizations seek to decriminalize sexual relationships between adults and children and to legalize child pornography based on their belief that children have the ability to consent to sexual acts…. Investigators should also be attentive to pedophilia symbols advertised on Web sites.“



The ABC late night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! has a recurrent skit of Kimmel’s “Cousin Sal” pranking people.

 On May 14, 2015, the skit was “Cousin Sal’s Home Deliveries — Pizza”. As you watch it, keep in mind the pedophile symbols and the FBI’s warning about those symbols on websites being “indicative of advertisement methods used by child sex predators to promote their cause”.

 

 In the event YouTube takes down the video, I took a screenshot from the video showing three decorative hooks on a wall outside Cousin Sal’s front door, two of which are the pedophile symbols for boy lover.

 

 To the innocent, the wall hooks are just wiggly decorative wall hooks.

 But not to pedophiles. They know that in the “Cousin Sal” skit, Jimmy Kimmel was signaling to “boy lover” pedophiles. That the home deliveries were for pizzas — the pedophile code word for little girls — is another Kimmel nod-and-wink to fellow pedophiles.

970,"On February 7th of 1987, the Washington Post ran an interesting story that did not at the time seem to have any particular national significance. The article concerned a case of possible kidnapping and child abuse, and read (in part) as follows:

“Authorities investigating the alleged abuse of six children found with two men in a Tallahassee, Fla., park discovered material yesterday in the Washington area that they say points to a 1960′s style commune called the Finders, described in a court document as a ‘cult‘ that allegedly conducted ‘brainwashing‘ and used children ‘in rituals.’ D. C. police, who searched a Northeast Washington warehouse linked to the group removed large plastic bags filled with color slides, photographs and photographic contact sheets. Some photos visible through a bag carried from the warehouse at 1307 Fourth St. NE were wallet-sized pictures of children, similar to school photos, and some were of naked children. D.C. police sources said some of the items seized yesterday showed pictures of children engaged in what appeared to be ‘cult rituals.’ Officials of the U.S. Customs Service, called in to aid in the investigation, said that the material seized yesterday includes photos showing children involved in bloodletting ceremonies of animals and one photograph of a child in chains. Customs officials said they were looking into whether a child pornography operation was being conducted … Their links to the D.C. area have led authorities into a far-reaching investigation that includes the Finders – a group of about 40 people that court documents allege is led by a man named Marion Pettie – and their various homes, including the duplex apartment building in Glover Park, the Northeast Washington warehouse and a 90 acre farm in rural Madison County, Va. … The children, identified in a court document only by the first names of Honeybee, John Franklin, Bee Bee, Max and Mary, were described as ‘dirty unkempt, hungry, disturbed and agitated.’ They had been living in the rear of the van for some time, the document said. Yesterday, police spokesman Hunt said one of the children, a 6 yr. old girl ‘showed signs of sexual abuse’ … Five of the children were uncommunicative, according to police, and none seemed to recognize objects such as typewriters and staplers. However, the oldest was able to give investigators some information. She said that the two men ‘were their teachers,’ according to Hunt … Before their arrests in the park, [the two adult caretakers] had told police that they were teachers from Washington ‘transporting these children to Mexico and a school for brilliant children,’ according to Hunt. When police asked the men where the children’s mothers were they said they were being weaned from their mothers.” (1)

This was just one of many such stories that emerged across the country in the late 1980′s, a phenomenon that would be quickly be denounced as a ‘witch hunt’ and as a ‘Satanic panic.’ It would be nearly seven years before the press would revisit this particular manifestation of what would come to be regarded as a modern-day case of mass hysteria. It was the U.S. News and World Report that would ultimately provide the follow-up to the Finders story. But this was certainly not in the interest of shining any light on the earlier allegations. Most likely, the strange saga of the Finders would have disappeared forever if not for the rumors surrounding the case that just wouldn’t seem to go away.

These rumors were addressed in the News report as follows: “One of the unresolved questions involves allegations that the Finders are somehow linked to the Central Intelligence Agency. Custom Service documents reveal that in 1987, when Customs agents sought to examine the evidence gathered by Washington, D.C. police, they were told that the Finders investigation ‘had become an internal matter.’ The police report on the case had been classified secret. Even now, Tallahassee police complain about the handling of the Finders investigation by D.C. police. ‘They dropped this case,’ one Tallahassee investigator says, ‘like a hot rock.’ D.C. police will not comment on the matter. As for the CIA, ranking officials describe allegations about links between the intelligence agency and the Finders as ‘hogwash,’ perhaps the result of a simple mix up with D.C. police. The only connection, according to the CIA: A firm that provided computer training to CIA officers also employed several members of the Finders. (2)

It should probably be noted here that the firm that supplied the training didn’t just employ several members of the Finders but appears to have in fact been a wholly owned subsidiary of the Finders organization. It should also be noted that the CIA does not, as a general rule-of-thumb, assign the training of its officers to outside contractors. If a ‘private’ firm is utilized in such a capacity, it is in all such cases a front group of the CIA itself.

In the last paragraph of the U.S. News report, yet more intriguing connections to Langley are revealed. Speaking of group leader Marion Pettie, it is noted that “the CIA’s interest in the Finders may stem from the fact that his late wife once worked for the agency and that his son worked for a CIA proprietary firm, Air America.” Aside from acknowledging these by then widely known (in Washington, at least) CIA connections, the U.S. News reporters did their very best to bury this story once and for all, denigrating the sordid allegations leveled against the group seven years earlier. The article reads as follows:

“The case is almost seven years old now, but matters surrounding a mysterious group known as the Finders keep growing curiouser and curiouser. In early February 1987, an anonymous tipster in Tallahassee, Fla, made a phone call to police. Two ‘well dressed men’ seemed to be ‘supervising’ six disheveled and hungry children in a local park, the caller said. The cops went after the case like bloodhounds, at least at first. The two men were identified as members of the Finders. They were charged with child abuse in Florida. In Washington, D.C. police and U.S. Customs Service agents raided a duplex apartment building and a warehouse connected to the group. Among the evidence seized – detailed instructions on obtaining children for unknown purposes and several photographs of nude children. According to a Customs Service memorandum obtained by U.S. News, one photo appeared ‘to accent the child’s genitals.’ The more the police learned about the Finders, the more bizarre they seemed: There were suggestions of child abuse, Satanism, dealing in pornography and ritualistic animal slaughter. None of the allegations was ever proved, however. The child abuse charges against the two men in Tallahassee were dropped; all six of the children were eventually returned to their mothers, though in the case of two, conditions were attached by a court. In Washington, D.C. police began backing away from the Finders investigation. The groups practices, the police said, were eccentric – not illegal.” (2)

The article closed by noting that “some of the rumors can last an awfully long time.” Indeed they can, though the rumors would have to circulate outside of the media, which has never again mentioned the case. This does not mean though that there is no additional information available on the subject. As the News noted in their report, there is a certain Customs Service memorandum that was written at the time of the original investigation.

As this document was in the hands of the News reporters at the time the story was written, as is readily acknowledged, it should logically follow that any pertinent information contained therein would have been faithfully reported. And as we know, the News concluded that “none of the allegations was ever proved.” Still, it might be interesting to review the document to see what kind of “eccentric – not illegal” practices it was that the group was involved in. As luck would have it, I also happen to have a copy of the memo, which is actually a series of memos written by Ramon J. Martinez, Special Agent, United States Customs Service. In Martinez’s own words, this is what he observed during his participation in the investigation:

“On Thursday, February 5, 1987, this office was contacted via telephone by Sergeant JoAnn VanMETER of the Tallahassee Police Department, Juvenile Division. Sgt. VanMETER requested assistance in identifying two adult males and six minor children ages 7 years to 2 years.

“The adult males were tentatively identified by TPD as Michael HOULIHAN and Douglas AMMERMAN, both of Washington, D.C. who were arrested the previous day on charges of child abuse.

“The police had received an anonymous telephone call relative two well-dressed white men wearing suits and ties in Myers Park, (Tallahassee), apparently watching six dirty and unkempt children in the playground area. HOULIHAN and AMMERMAN were near a 1980 Blue Dodge van bearing Virginia license number XHW-557, the inside of which was later described as foul-smelling filled with maps, books, letters, with a mattress situated to the rear of the van which appeared as if it were used as a bed, and the overall appearance of the van gave the impression that all eight persons were living in it.

“The children were covered with insect bites, were very dirty, most of the children were not wearing underwear and all of the children had not been bathed in many days.

“The men were arrested and charged with multiple counts of child abuse and lodged in the Leon County Jail. Once in custody the men were somewhat evasive in their answers to the police regarding the children and stated only that they both were the children’s teachers and that all were enroute to Mexico to establish a school for brilliant children …

“U.S. Customs was contacted because the police officers involved suspected the adults of being involved in child pornography and knew the Customs Service to have a network of child pornography investigators, and of the existence of the Child Pornography and Protection Unit. SS/A Krietlow stated the two adults were well dressed white males. They had custody of six white children (boys and girls), ages three to six years. The children were observed to be poorly dressed, bruised, dirty, and behaving like wild animals in a public park in Tallahassee …

“SS/A Kreitlow was further advised the children were unaware of the function and purpose of telephones, televisions and toilets, and that the children had stated they were not allowed to live indoors and were only given food as a reward …

“Upon contacting Detective Bradley, I learned that he had initiated an investigation on the two addresses provided by the Tallahassee Police Dept. during December of 1986. An informant had given him information regarding a cult, known as the “Finders” operating various businesses out of a warehouse located at 1307 4th St., N.E., and were supposed to be housing children at 3918/3920 W St., N.W. The information was specific in describing ‘blood rituals’ and sexual orgies involving children, and an as yet unsolved murder in which the Finders may be involved. With the information provided by the informant, Detective Bradley was able to match some of the children in Tallahassee with names of children known alleged to be in the custody of the Finders. Furthermore, Bradley was able to match the tentative ID of the adults with known members of the Finders. I stood by while Bradley consulted with AUSA Harry Benner and obtained search warrants for the two premises. I advised acting RAC SS/A Tim Halloran of my intention to accompany MPD on the execution of the warrants, received his permission, and was joined by SS/A Harrold. SS/A Harrold accompanied the team which went to 1307 4th St., and I went to 3918/20 W St.

“During the execution of the warrant at 3918/20 W St., I was able to observe and access the entire building … There were several subjects on the premises. Only one was deemed to be connected with the Finders. [He] was located in a room equipped with several computers, printers, and numerous documents. Cursory examination of the documents revealed detailed instructions for obtaining children for unspecified purposes. The instructions included the impregnation of female members of the community known as the Finders, purchasing children, trading, and kidnapping. There were telex messages using MCI account numbers between a computer terminal believed to be located in the same room, and others located across the country and in foreign locations. One such telex specifically ordered the purchase of two children in Hong Kong to be be arranged through a contact in the Chinese Embassy there. Another telex expressed interest in ‘bank secrecy’ situations. Other documents identified interests in high-tech transfers to the United Kingdom, numerous properties under the control of the Finders, a keen interest in terrorism, explosives, and the evasion of law enforcement. Also found in the ‘computer room’ was a detailed summary of the events surrounding the arrest and taking into custody of the two adults and six children in Tallahassee the previous night. There were also a set of instructions which appeared to be broadcast via a computer network which advised the participants to move ‘the children’ and keep them moving through different jurisdictions, and instructions on how to avoid police attention …

“On Friday, 2/6/87, I met Detective Bradley at the warehouse on 4th Street, N.E. I duly advised my acting group supervisor, SS/A Don Bludworth. I was again granted unlimited access to the premises. I was able to observe numerous documents which described explicit sexual conduct between the members of the community known as Finders. I also saw a large collection of photographs of unidentified persons. Some of the photographs were nudes, believed to be of members of the Finders. There were numerous photos of children, some nude, at least one of which was a photo of a child ‘on display’ and appearing to accent the child’s genitals. I was only able to examine a very small amount of the photos at this time. However, one of the officers presented me with a photo album for my review. The album contained a series of photos of adults and children dressed in white sheets participating in a ‘blood ritual.’ The ritual centered around the execution of at least two goats. The photos portrayed the execution, disembowelment, skinning and dismemberment of the goats at the hands of the children. This included the removal of the testes of a male goat, the discovery of a female goat’s “womb” and the “baby goats” inside the womb, and the presentation of a goat’s head to one of the children.

“Further inspection of the premises disclosed numerous files relating to activities of the organization in different parts of the world. Locations I observed are as follows: London, Germany, the Bahamas, Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Africa, Costa Rica, and ‘Europe.’ There was also a file identified as ‘Palestinian.’ Other files were identified by member name or ‘project’ name. The projects appearing to be operated for commercial purposes under front names for the Finders. There was one file entitled ‘Pentagon Break-In,’ and others referring to members operating in foreign countries. Not observed by me but related by an MPD officer were intelligence files on private families not related to the Finders. The process undertaken appears to be have been a systematic response to local newspaper advertisements for babysitters, tutors, etc. A member of the Finders would respond and gather as much information as possible about the habits, identity, occupation, etc., of the family. The use to which this information was to be put is still unknown. There was also a large amount of data collected on various child care organizations.

“The warehouse contained a large library, two kitchens, a sauna, hot-tub, and a ‘video room.’ The video room seemed to be set up as an indoctrination center. It also appeared that that the organization had the capability to produce its own videos. There were what appeared to be training areas for children and what appeared to be an altar set up in a residential area of the warehouse. Many jars of urine and feces were located in this area.” (3)

I’m going to go out on a limb here and guess that most people, upon reading this, will conclude that the practices of the Finders were not in fact merely “eccentric.” The last time I checked into it, running an international terrorist organization specializing in the trafficking of children was definitely illegal. Unless, that is, the organization doing the trafficking is run by the Central Intelligence Agency.

Group leader Marion Pettie shed additional light on his non-connections to the agency in an interview with Steamshovel Press in 1998. Recounting the history of his group, Pettie notes that: “Going back to World War II, I kept open house mainly to intelligence people in Washington. OSS people passing through, things like that.” (4)

He wasn’t, mind you, an intelligence asset himself. In fact, according to Pettie, he has spent his entire life trying – as a private citizen – to spy on the spies. As for his wife, he claims he sent her “in as a spy, to spy on the CIA for me. She was very happy about it, happy to tell me everything she found out. She was in a key place, you know with the records, and she could find out things for me.” (4)

Pettie also acknowledges that his “son worked for Air America, which was a proprietary of the CIA. There are some connections, but not to me personally.” (4) Of course not. In fact, Pettie is something of a CIA watch-dog, proclaiming that he has “been studying them since before they were born.”

“I was studying them back in the 30′s. It was ONI back then [Office of Naval Intelligence], and then the Coordinator of Information comes on, and after that it turns into the OSS and OSS turns into the CIAU and the CIAU turns into the CIA. So I’ve been studying that all of my life. But I wasn’t personally working for them.” (4)

Of course he wasn’t. I have no idea where anyone would get a crazy notion like that. Interestingly enough, though, this group which claimed no direct connection to the intelligence community quite obviously had very powerful people within that community protecting it. As the final Customs Service memo notes:

“On Thursday, February 5, 1987, Senior Special Agent Harrold and I assisted the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) with two search warrants involving the possible sexual exploitation of children. During the course of the search warrants, numerous documents were discovered which appeared to be concerned with international trafficking in children, high tech transfer to the United Kingdom, and international transfer of currency.

“On March 31, 1987, I contacted Detective Jim Bradley of the Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). I was to meet with Detective Bradley to review the documents seized pursuant to two search warrants executed in January, 1987. The meeting was to take place on April 2 or 3, 1987.

“On April 2, 1987, I arrived at MPD at approximately 9:00 a.m. Detective Bradley was not available. I spoke to a third party who was willing to discuss the case with me on a strictly ‘off the record’ basis.

“I was advised that all the passport data had been turned over to the State Department for their investigation. The State Department in turn, advised the MPD that all travel and use of the passports by the holders of the passports was within the law and no action would be taken. This included travel to Moscow, North Korea, and North Vietnam from the late 1950s to mid 1970s.

“The individual further advised me of circumstances which indicated that the investigation into the activity of the Finders had become a CIA internal matter. The MPD report has been classified SECRET and was not available for review. I was advised that the FBI had withdrawn from the investigation several weeks prior and that the FBI Foreign Counter Intelligence Division had directed MPD not to advise the FBI Washington Field Office of anything that had transpired.

“No further information will be available. No further action will be taken.”

And with these rather cryptic words, the case of the Finders was permanently closed. So there you have it. The only question now remaining, I suppose, is simply this: how long can we – the American people – allow a government to stand that is so depraved, so fundamentally corrupt and criminal, so completely lacking in any semblance of morals or basic human decency that it would traffic in the minds and bodies of our children?

More reports surfaced that children were being stolen in South and Central America, flown across the border in light aircraft, and sold to child sex rings, or sold so their organs could be used in transplants.

There was no shortage of rumors about who was involved. One named was Air Force Colonel Phil Willer, a World War II veteran turned contraband-runner. His twin-engined Beechcraft had finally been shot down by a Mexican antiaircraft unit, crashing in flames. Willer died strapped into the cockpit. Ironically, there was no one else on board. But the story persisted that other fliers had inherited his role and substantial income. One was known as the Desert Jackal, a sixty-year-old American who learned his flying against the Japanese in the Pacific in World War II. Another had flown a helicopter gunship in Vietnam.

A pilot could make two thousand dollars on a ninety-minute round trip from some Mexican mountaintop or jungle clearing, skimming over the border to land at a remote landing strip in New Mexico or Texas.

Some made two or three flights a day. The more experienced used Beech 18s because of the aircraft’s capacity and maneuverability. The majority of the fliers were mercenaries who had flown for the CIA.",conspiracy,C01cbf,pizzagate
1178,"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger on Friday said he wouldn't be surprised to see Alex Ferguson go back on his decision to retire.



Former Manchester United manager Ferguson quit Old Trafford at the end of last season after 26 and a half years in charge.



The Scot was back in the headlines this week with the publication of an updated autobiography which included a number of stinging rebukes aimed at the likes of David Beckham, Roy Keane, Steven Gerrard and Rafael Benitez.



Wenger has his own dedicated chapter in the book, entitled 'Competing with Wenger' - much of which is centred around the infamous 'pizzagate' at Old Trafford in October 2004 when United ended the Gunners' 49-match unbeaten Premier League run.



The Gunners boss had a spikey relationship with Ferguson at times, but they are more friendly these days.



And Wenger, now the longest-serving manager in the Premier League following Ferguson's retirement, is not certain it will be easy for his old rival to just simply walk away forever and the Frenchman suggested he could even change his mind in the next six months.



""In six months we will know more about that (whether Ferguson will return to football). You cannot rule it completely out,"" said Wenger ahead of his side's Premier League fixture at Crystal Palace on Saturday.



""It is difficult to take a drug for 30 years and suddenly get rid of it.""



However, after witnessing the storm of controversy that greeted Ferguson's book, Wenger has no intention of writing his own memoirs just yet.



""We are in a job that is a good teacher of humility, because we have to accept that everybody can judge our job at any moment without completely knowing all the ingredients of our job,"" he said.



""But it is part of it, with the positive and the negative.



""Sometimes they give us credit we don't deserve as well, but we have to take both sides.



""It looks like Ferguson had prepared his book while he was managing - I suspect he had written some of it at home at night, remembering things and thinking: 'that goes into my book!'.""",mainstream,M1d245,pizzagate
54,"FLASH - The sole video showing suspect' Nikolas de Jesus Cruz, on February 14 taken more than an hour after the Parkland school shooting, was recorded by a security camera of the CHAI CHABAD HOUSE of the Lubavitcher-Shomrim ultraOrthodox Jewish cult on 5761 Coral Ridge Drive (located inside the northwest bend of Sawgrass Parkway - Hwy 869), just minutes before his arrest on the U-shaped Wyndham Lakes Drive, no. 4700,, which has no exit except Coral Ridge Drive. The Chai Chabad title was shown on the clip posted at CNN. This indicates that, as earlier mentioned in this investigative series, that the Jewish-born Cruz was likely recruited by the Shomrim secret society to be a patsy for the commando raid and was brainwashed at Chabad House. Everyone should be wary when the most powerful men in America exploit the Parkland school massacre to call for gun seizures from the citizenry, especially after this same elite was directly responsible for the deaths by firearms of hundreds of thousands of civilians in their wars from Afghanistan and Iraq to Libya and Syria, along with dozens of other countries. Their national project for disarmament of Americans is exactly why the Founding Fathers, in their prescient wisdom, drafted the Second Amendment to prevent the return of an absolutist tyranny against a defenseless public. This is the hour not to cave into emotional weakness but rather to stand strong at arms, in the common defense of a sovereign people as mandated by the U.S. Constitution. The March for Our Lives, scheduled for March 24, is being promoted by the manipulative media as an youth initiative by five Parkland school “survivors” led by the son of Kevin Hogg, who is one of James Comey’s FBI agents. In fact, the actual permit holder for the upcoming Washington D.C. rally for gun control is not the Parkland students but instead Everytown for Gun Safety, a controversial lobby group, notorious for its inflated estimates of gun-related violence. In the wake of the Sandy Hook elementary school incident, Everytown was founded by urban mayors allied with Mike Bloomberg, former boss of New York City and millionaire publisher of Bloomberg business news. His list of advisory board members reads like an all-star list of CIA spy chiefs, warmongers and agents provocateur. What does prohibiting gun sales have to do with the murderous career of a war criminal like Admiral Mike Mullen, former head of the Joint Chiefs who launched the Afghan and Iraq Wars on a false pretext for George W. Bush? The answer is simple: To make it easier to impose a militarist regime on Americans like the pedophile regime installed in Kabul, Afghanistan. Every town in the USA lost sons and brothers thanks Bloomberg’s advisers, notably retired Oklahoma Sen. Dave Boren, former head of the Senate Intelligence Committee and mentor of CIA director George Tenet, who plotted the NATO interventions in the Balkans, the invasion of Afghanistan and then rigged the Powell report to start the Second Gulf War. Closer to home, on that same advisory board, there’s retired ATF official Dave Chipman, who was just involved in the cover-up of the Las Vegas Harvest Festival massacre; and Chris McDonnell, who notoriously posed for a professional photographer’s “grief portrait” at Sandy Hook School, the sort of publicity stunt that convinces people about crisis actors. Not being one of those gullible believers, I try to focus instead on the reality of merciless human butchery, as gut-wrenching as that may be. Further verifying a Zionist role in the Parkland School commando strike (see Parts 1,2 and 3 of this series), two of the Everytown advisers are linked with the special-weapons program of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF): Eli Broad, founder of his namesake institute involved in biowarfare research on ebola in West Africa; and Qualcomm boss Irwin Jacobs who funds Technion, the Israeli Institute of Technology, which created and developed the IDF cyber-warfare program. As discussed below, the IDF Cyberwar Command is yet another Israeli component involved in the Parkland false-flag operation, specifically responsible for jamming the Broward county police radio and hijacking Parkland school’s video-monitoring security system with insertion of fake video-clips, similar to the video-capture methods shown in the casino robbery in “Ocean’s Eleven” starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt. The role of Kevin Ralph Hogg in the electronic warfare operation against the police-rescue team is also exposed here. Other Obama-Clinton cronies on the Everytown board include Tom Barrett, the Milwaukee mayor who played a key role in advocating the 2008 bailout for Wall Street; and Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, founder of the Philly Rising militant group with funds from George Soros in alliance with Black Lives Matter. In less than a week after the Parkland school attack, George “Clueless” Clooney was the first Hollywood (CA not FL) celebrity to donate a half million dollars to the Go Fund Me account of the March for Our Lives protest movement, which was set up by student hustlers Cameron Kasky and David Hogg. The latter’s father, Kevin Hogg, has a spooky record with the FBI, indicating MFOL is not a charity for wound victims but instead a cold calculated political move for daddy Hogg’s superiors at the FBI, Justice and CIA. A former USAF pilot, Kevin Hogg was the FBI official at LAX who released the mysterious Nigerian-American “storyteller” Olajid Oluwaseun Noibi in 2012, after he illegally boarded Virgin Airlines without a proper ticket or passport, apparently on a journey eventually headed toward Africa. After his arrest Noibi pretended to be an actor mimicking the life of Jesus, but on his booking at a police station he was wearing a black Islamic skull cap, indicating affiliation with Boko Haram. Comey appointee Agent Hogg let him slip off the hook for a second surreptitious attempt at evading exit procedures to escape the country, apparently for plausible deniability. Nearly succeeding on his first try, Noibi was caught only because of the vigilance of a stewardess. Obama’s pro-Muslim policy, under which ISIS was created, is rife with these sorts of unregistered Islamist passengers, state-sponsored terrorists departing from Western airports into insurgency-plagued regions, like the pair who died in the explosion at a Belgian airport. The pretty boy of TV soap operas, George Clooney owed his movie-heartthrob career to his father’s collaboration with the CIA and the Jesuit intelligence nexus on their Darfur phony-refugee project in support of heavily armed Chadian guerrillas in a pipeline war against oil-rich Sudan. His dad Nick Clooney is a journalism teacher at American University in D.C. and an active member of the Newseum, both of which are intel linked. His actor son’s lead roles in intelligence-themed movies “Syriana”, “Argo”, “Men Who Stare at Goats” and “Confessions of a Dangerous Mind” leave no doubt about George Clooney’s close connections with the CIA. A swinger (that’s only half of it), he probably had no choice but to cooperate with the Feds’ propaganda machine after disclosure of his longtime friendship with mobster Rick Rizzolo, owner of the Crazy Horse Too stripper club in Las Vegas. Mothers of Parkland, you’re allowing this whore-monger to cozy up to your kids? Another Pied Piper, he’s taking them away for a children’s crusade to help his spook bosses at Langley and the Pentagon. Sorry, Amal, you made a huge mistake falling for a con artist (did you not notice he’s a natural for the role of gambling cheat Danny Ocean?) so go back to the sanity of Beirut, where at least you know who your enemies are. Enough gossip. Now what about the gameplan for Ocean’s Eleven Redux? The Console Cowboys blog details how any CCTV system can be hijacked with an online hack though a port. Not only could an electronic intrusion capture a video camera, the entire recording and replay system can be remotely controlled for substitution of video clips, as happened during the supposed “lone-gunman” escape from Parkland School. In article titled “Video delays misled cops at Stoneman Douglas shooting”, reporters with the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel explained: “The Broward School District's security cameras did not provide real-time video for police during the (day of the) shooting, and an outdated radio system provided further confusion. . . . Police thought they were seeing (the fleeing suspect) live on security cameras, still in the building. They were actually seeing images tape-delayed (by at least 30 minutes).” Or perhaps the inserted video scenes were prerecorded at a staged rehearsal. The county school superintendent was baffled by the technically impossible error in constant real-time video: “There would be no point in having a video system in the school with a delay. Why would anybody have that?” A security-studies professor who heads a national active-shooter program at Texas State University was quoted in the Sun-Sentinel as responding: “I’ve never heard of that before.” In addition, police officers told the reporters that their radio scanner reception was blocked by “some sort of feedback”. The Sun-Sentinel disclosed that similar radio breakdowns hampered police response to the mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale- Hollywood Airport a year ago January. That airport shooting “overwhelmed the county’s antiquated radio system, disrupting communications. Some policemen could hear but not talk as they were trying to determine if there was a second shooter.” The young Jimmy Olsen reporters need some correcting from an old-timer like me: “Out of date” Motorola radio sets are far more reliable than today’s flimsy digital phones. In a low-rise area as flat as Broward County, radio reception should be crystal clear. The police scanner was deliberated jammed. So what’s the odds for two separate communications breakdowns, one based in the district school board and the other located in the sheriff’s office, at exactly the same time? Also, for triple risk-management add on the likelihood for NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, MD, being disrupted by a car break-in earlier that day, diverting away national-security attention? In a tribute to Israeli electronics genius, allow me to repeat a quote from an IDF Cyber-Command officer reported by the Arutz Sheva 7 newspaper, in its Feb. 23, 2016 edition: ""We are ahead of the rest of the world in digital capabilities by at least 15 years. We've integrated operational Internet capabilities which enable any commander to do anything in any place.” Anything anywhere and any time includes a commando strike against Parkland school on St. Valentine’s day. The electronic warfare used for the exfiltration phase of Operation Parkland had to be precisely coordinated with the movements of three assailants, and their forward observer, who must have used a different frequency with communications to their headquarters. Not surprising, the former Navy flyer aboard a carrier, Kevin Ralph Hogg is employed at Cubic Simulations Systems in nearby Pompano Beach, which develops programs and graphics for military training and operations. Under DOD contracts, Cubic divides its various ops-planning sections into different regions of the country. Cubic’s Pompano staff, where the father of Parkland student David Hogg works, focuses on joint-services commando operations such a hostage rescue or strikes on terrorist homes, using cyber tech developed by the IDF cyberwar division. For example, this is DOD procurement order for the Cubic regional office in Orlando: Cubic Simulation Systems Inc., Orlando, Fla., is being awarded a $19,930,555 modification (P00002), to a previously award firm-fixed-price, foreign-military-sales (FMS) contract (W900KK-13-C-0010), for the procurement of Israeli Defense Forces Engagement Skills Trainer 2000 Plus Systems and related services. Therefore, the obvious conclusion is that: Far from being a victim, David Hogg was one of the forward observers of the joint Israeli-CIA death squad sent to Parkland, ensuring that sufficient numbers of his classmates were killed. The faker should arrested and put under extreme interrogation, along with his father, to confess to their assigned roles in the Soros-style psyop called March for Our Lives. Both father and son suffer degenerative nerve disorders associated with electromagnetic warfare, so never think there isn’t divine justice. The grandfather of David Hogg was an FBI agent who became CEO of Mastercard, but was later forced out of the company by the board of directors under a cloud of suspicion, related to his authorization of illegal diversions to a powerful cabal, possibly the same secret society behind the FBI Russiagate affair. Of course, the Hogg clandestine role is all in keeping with the eye in pyramid of the Federal Reserve Bank, just like former FBI boss Robert Mueller, a grandmaster of that subversion (Alexander) Hamiltonian secret society. Don’t get me wrong since I do tend to moralize due to an overly religious upbringing: I like money nearly as much as anyone does, musically speaking, that is. For example, that bouncy ABBA tune: “Money, money, money in a rich man’s world.” The best lyrics about moolah come not from Pharell but from that ancient though immortal band of “Louie-Louie” fame, The Kingsmen: “You know the best things in life are free, but you can give ‘em to the birds and the bees, cause I want money, yeah, that’s what I want, I want your money . . . muuh. . .uh. . . uh . . . nee, that ‘s what I want!” Honesty like that is a rare commodity nowadays. The difference between then and now is: In the Vietnam War era the young GIs and student protesters alike weren’t paid crap to risk their lives, whereas the Parkland snowflakes who hid in the closet got millions of dollars through Go Fund Me. What do these losers deserve for failing to attempt a rescue of the wounded or gang-tackle the assailants? A whipping behind the tool shed is what. It’s admirable that one ROTC student died holding open a door for others, but three or more acting in unison could have teamed up to pounce on a gunman instead of everyone cringing in loneliness and fear. As Ben Franklin put it about being frightened during the unrelenting bloodbath during the Revolution: Either we must all hang together or most assuredly we will all hang separately. Cowardice deserves no pity. GoFundMe pages, most of them posted by fraudsters, are proliferating like pythons in the Everglades. The Miami Herald had to kill its appeals due to the uncertainty of the identities of actual recipients. There were so many fake “victims” that the GoFundMe site decided to limit the fundraising to Broward Education Foundation. Not before pages had been set up by families of 22 shooting victims (Yes, I am aware there were only 17 dead, but some of these are for the wounded, although not all the wounded). Maybe I’ve suffered from excessive depression at the loss of family members and best friends, so I’ve never set up a lemonade stand at a funeral. By the way, if anyone who is considering an online appeal, the State of Florida covers the cost of the victim’s funerals, therefore the dozens of claimants asking for funds to bury dead students are either totally uninformed or fake. See you at the trial, and I sure do hope Judge Judy hangs you. The bodies weren’t even cold yet before high-school junior Cameron Kasky posted his plea for donations to support the partisan Democrat protest planned for March 24 aka March for Our Lives. This nasty drama student was the one who dissed Sen. Marco Rubio for showing up at a townhall meeting to show his sympathy and hear community opinion. Young Cameron showed zero intention to persuade Rubio but spoke out only to polarize the distraught crowd. I do not appreciate Rubio’s voting record either, but the week of mourning is not the time to play politics. Now that it’s started, Cameron is getting what’s coming to him. The art of hustle runs in the Kaskowitz family bloodstream. On the issue of children’s welfare, it should be noted that Cameron’s grandfather and his father Jeffrey A. Kasky, Jr. are attorneys who serve as president and vice president of the profit-making surrogacy program called One World Adoptions. The OWA slogan for impoverished young women of child-bearing age is: “Make a Pregnancy Statement.” That’s a new brand of feminism. Dad Jeffrey is co-author of “The ABA Guide to Assisted Reproduction”, something that George Clooney might be interested in volunteering for. The Florida branch is linked by one of its board members to a Georgia adoption group that goes by the same name, which specializes in procuring children for adoption from the Clinton happy hunting ground of Haiti, a reminder of the murder of child-rights researcher Monica Petersen (which was part of the Pizzagate scandal). If any of you Kaskys have information on her last days in Haiti, be sure to convey the details to us at rense.com. How’s that for women’s rights, Oprah? Maybe you should volunteer to be a surrogate, too, to help wealthy infertile couples and pedophile pimps in the Kingdom of Wakanda. One of the earlier cash respondents, indeed, was Oprah Winfrey in an act of solidarity with the planned MFOL protest in Washington D.C., which of course has absolutely nothing to do with her ambitions to be the first Wakandan president of the USA. Her butting-in the debate is reason enough for the NRA to beef up the citizen self-defense program, to keep that FAB out of the Oval Office. FAB stands for not what you’re thinking but for “fuel-air bomb”, since she’s got such explosive talent. So hold your breath. Other Hollywood heavyweights fell into line after The Don, George Clooney, made his grandiose gesture. They included Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Obama groupie and former Disney executive whose main product line was sexualized and emotionally whacked kids like Miley Cyrus and Christina Aguilera, rolling out of his Mickey Mouse Club treadmill. Then there’s Stephen Spielberg who hates firearms so much that he produced war-glorifying movies like “Saving Private Ryan” and “War Horse” and gun-slinging thrillers “Minority Report” and “Raider’s of the Lost Ark.” The “H” in Hollywood stands for either “hypocrisy” or “heroin”, take your pick, kids, since you’re soon going to be in wonderful company to be picked off by the D.C. pedophiles. Just wait till they drop you off at Jimmy Cosmic’s Ping Pong pizza parlor. Don’t call 911 for a rescue because Sheriff Israel won’t be around to save you on time. The rapidity of political polarization out of Marjorie Stoneman Douglas high school during the mourning period, along with the immediate claim from the sneaks at the Anti-Defamation League about the Jewish-born suspect Nikolas Cruz belonging to a white supremacist group, indicate that the Parkland school shooting was another long-planned false-flag attack, similar to the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school assault in Newtown, Connecticut. The pieces of the jigsaw are by now, more or less, in place following this fourth part of the investigative series. I hope a fifth is not required unless it’s single malt. For those readers wanting to connect more dots, Nikolas Cruz’s child psychology clinic run by Dr. David Lubin is just 3 blocks down the road from the office of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz on Sawgrass Parkway in Sunrise township, Broward Country. It’s a small world after all, inhabited by enterprising young “survivors”, manipulative parents, dirty cops, gun-toting religious fanatics, corrupt politicians, would-be tyrants and so-called crazed killers. It’s just life and death in a fishbowl.",conspiracy,C0157c,pizzagate
881,"When Gibson was pulled over by police for drunk driving in 2006, the officers recorded him saying (among other things) that “Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world.” Years later, The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg asked him about that particular blowup, which Gibson said was a result of drunkenness. “I was loaded, and some stupid shit can come out of your mouth when you’re loaded,” the actor said in 2011, claiming that his invective was prompted by Israel’s conflict with Lebanon at the time. Gibson’s 2004 film The Passion of the Christ had been criticized for pushing the anti-Semitic notion that Jews were to blame for the death of Jesus. The director’s attempt at a follow-up movie about Judah Maccabee never came to fruition, but its screenwriter alleged that Gibson was publicly hateful of Jews and used several anti-Semitic epithets in their time working together (Gibson denied the allegations, but admitted to having had “a little bit of a temper”).

Despite Gibson’s widely reported past behavior, HanWay Films, a British distributor that mostly works on indie projects, announced on Monday that it had acquired the international rights to Rothchild. Shia LaBeouf—who is Jewish—has been cast as the main character, Becket Rothchild, who conspires to kill the nine entitled scions who are in the way of him inheriting the family fortune. Gibson will play Whitelaw Rothchild, Becket’s sinister grandfather. Jon S. Baird, who last made the sleepy 2018 biopic Stan & Ollie, will direct, and the script is by John Patton Ford.

“The divide between the superrich and the rest of the world is an ever-growing one, and it’s both fun and fascinating to delve into its inner bowels along with our hero trying to scramble to the top and claim his piece,” HanWay’s managing director, Gabrielle Stewart, said to The Hollywood Reporter about the movie. The thrust of the story—a villain kills off his rich relatives to try to secure their wealth—is reminiscent of classic black comedies such as Kind Hearts and Coronets, but that makes the choice of title for Rothchild even more befuddling. If the film is really intended as a broad satire of the 1 percent, then why pick such a specific, charged name?

The Cannes marketplace is where production companies try to raise money for their projects by bundling stars, directors, and scripts together and shopping them around to various distributors. Gibson, like many other performers who were huge in the ’80s and ’90s, remains a massive draw overseas, and has helped secure funding for controversial projects such as Dragged Across Concrete by simply agreeing to appear in them. Many movies announced at the marketplace never actually make it to production, and Rothchild may not weather the backlash that is already building against this initial announcement. But the project’s existence alone is a stark example of how much Gibson’s reputation has recovered in the industry—and how tone-deaf companies are continuing to be about his past actions.",mainstream,M1dd2b,illuminati; pizzagate
989,"US television network ABC has cancelled hit sitcom Roseanne after a racist tweet which said that Valerie Jarrett, an African American aide for Barack Obama, was the child of the Muslim Brotherhood and The Planet of the Apes.

ABC’s Trump-era revival of Roseanne, a show that originally followed a working-class family in 1980s America, was a ratings hit. Its premiere pulled an impressive 18 million viewers, with 13 million Americans tuning in to subsequent episodes.

But the reboot also faced, and perhaps even courted, controversy. Golden Globe-winning comedian Roseanne Barr, the heart of the show, is a vocal Trump supporter. The president’s influence could be felt throughout, with regular references to making America “great again” and other Trump-like soundbites. Trump even told a crowd on 28 March that the show was “about us”, before admitting that he called Barr personally to congratulate her on such “huge” ratings.

Just as Trump has learned to play to his supporter base, Barr catered to hers as the series progressed, brushing off any criticism from viewers who did not like the show’s new direction. After coming under fire for portraying Muslim neighbours as potential terrorists, Barr simply responded that she would “challenge every sacred cow in [the] USA”.

On Twitter, Trump’s platform of choice, Barr became even more outspoken, sometimes even peddling bizarre conspiracy theories. In March she deleted a tweet accusing a survivor of the Parkland shooting of giving a Nazi salute.

But unlike her idol, Barr is now facing consequences for her actions. ABC has finally pulled the plug on Roseanne.

This poses a few uncomfortable questions. For instance: as repugnant and indefensible as Roseanne’s tweets are, what can we expect when the most powerful man in the world is routinely rewarded for deliberately causing offence? From beginning his campaign calling Mexican immigrants “rapists” to his infamous comments about people from “shithole countries” and his recent insistence that gang members are “animals”, Trump and his supporters have embraced offensive rhetoric and often revelled in their divisiveness. But unlike Barr, Trump will likely never face repercussions – and he knows it.

This is not the first time that organisations have severed ties with Trump’s supporters for crossing the line. Radio station LBC confirmed that Katie Hopkins was to leave with “immediate effect” after she used the term “final solution” about Islamism following the Manchester bombing last year. The Mail Online, where Hopkins wrote a column, followed suit shortly after. Publisher Simon & Schuster famously cancelled a book by Breitbart’s Milo Yiannopoulos after clips of the vocal Trump supporter appearing to defend paedophilia surfaced online.

Hopkins and Yiannopoulos had a track record of causing offence before they were offered these platforms, but the same can be said of Barr. In 2016, she likened Barack Obama to a Nazi on Twitter. Last year she peddled a debunked theory, popularly known as “Pizzagate”, that suggested Hillary Clinton was somehow involved in a worldwide sex trafficking and paedophilia ring. While ABC should rightly be applauded for their swift action, it is not unreasonable to suggest that, just like Hopkins and Yiannopoulos, she should have been deprived of such a platform in the first place.

Barr’s downfall is the natural consequence of the president’s followers being held to a higher standard than he is. When tweeting helped him capture the White House, and he continues to preach invincibility and rarely faces consequences, is it any wonder that his followers cross the line?

Barr may be gone from our screens, but the culture that created her and Trump’s other mouthpieces – a culture which rewards cruelty and lies – continues to thrive. While it remains to be seen who will become the next apologist-in-chief for Trump in popular culture, it seems a rather fitting that, after idolising Trump and his rambling tweets, Barr has been eventually toppled by her own.",mainstream,M0b613,pizzagate
503,"James Alefantis first learned about the conspiracy theory surrounding his pizzeria from a reporter’s phone call. In the waning days of the 2016 election, Will Sommer, then of the Washington City Paper in DC, had been following a thread on the site Reddit in which leaked emails from the Clinton campaign adviser John Podesta were used to justify an elaborate, and entirely false, story of a Clinton-run child abuse ring in the back of Comet Ping Pong pizza. Alefantis had never heard of the faux online hysteria and assumed, as he recalled in HBO’s new documentary After Truth: Disinformation and the Cost of Fake News, that “everybody is up about this election and passions are high – I’m sure this will go away in a couple of days”.

It did not go away. The ludicrous theory, known as Pizzagate, was picked up and propagated by infamous conspiracy monger Alex Jones, and disseminated on Facebook and Twitter. Harassment of Comet and its staff escalated: one-star Yelp reviews appeared with references to child dungeons. Pictures of Alefantis posted to Instagram of his godchildren were repurposed to attack him as a pedophile, with specific, hateful references to his identity as a gay man. Prank callers issued death threats. And then, on 4 December 2016, Edgar Welch, a 28-year-old man from North Carolina, convinced from online forums that he had to find the children himself, entered the pizzeria with an AR-15.

No one was hurt and Welch was arrested, but the episode underscored the terrifying power of conspiracy theories and fake news articles, cultivated in forums such as Reddit and 4chan and propagated by Facebook and Twitter, to metastasize offline, with dire consequences. “I don’t think you can understand Pizzagate until you see that bodycam footage from the DC metro police that we have in the first 20 minutes of this film,” Brian Stelter, host of CNN’s Reliable Sources and an executive producer of After Truth, told the Guardian. “It shows how average Americans can be radicalized by insane content on the internet and can be motivated to get in a car with a gun and go confront people at a pizzeria.”

After Truth tracks the influence of disinformation – a deliberately disseminated falsehood, as opposed to “misinformation”, which is an unintentional factual error – from a niche topic in 2015 through Russian weaponization in the 2016 election and ubiquity in the Trump presidency. “We’re looking at some of the biggest lies that continue to manipulate people’s imaginations, even after they’ve been thoroughly debunked and clarified,” Andrew Rossi, the director, told the Guardian. Though the term “fake news” dates back to 2014 – when BuzzFeed News’s Craig Silverman popularized it to describe false stories about the Ebola crisis – After Truth begins in 2015, with online conspiracies around a military drill in Bastrop county, Texas. Known as Jade Helm, the theories, harnessed by YouTube personalities, spilled into the town’s real life – now eerie footage depicts an army spokesperson shouted down by people who dismiss his reassurances as propaganda; instead, they believed an internet personality-driven theory that underground tunnels connected the town’s Walmarts to the military base. The hysteria caught Texas governor Greg Abbott’s attention, who treated it seriously. Russia took notice, and started replicating the pattern heading into America’s election year.

Beginning the arc in 2015 was deliberate – “this is bigger than any one president or term in office,” said Stelter – but disinformation certainly ramped up in unison with Donald Trump’s rise to the Republican nomination and, eventually, the presidency. His weaponization of the term “fake news” against legitimate news outlets in January 2017 represented “a signal moment”, said Stelter. “The president took the term and exploited it for his own political gain. Now, it’s the world’s worst game of whack-a-mole.”

After Truth seeks to put a face on the generally amorphous, sterile concept of disinformation, whether that be the pizzeria owner hounded by internet trolls or the frustratingly human role of prejudice and hate as “a foundation for fake stories and as a magnet for people who feel aggrieved to channel their confusion with the world and their disappointment into demonizing a group”, said Rossi. Comet Ping Pong was targeted as an LGBTQ+ safe space, for example; the Barack Obama birtherism theory in the early 2010s, of which Trump was a vocal proponent, was transparently racist.

For Comet, there was a somewhat happy ending: loyal customers rallied around the business, keeping it open. The same cannot be said for the family of Seth Rich, a 27-year-old Democratic National Committee (DNC) staffer killed in an unsolved botched robbery in the summer of 2016. Rich’s death became fodder for online conspiracy theorists, who baselessly linked the staffer to DNC emails actually leaked by Russia and claimed murder by the Clintons. The Fox News host Sean Hannity ran a primetime story boosting the Rich conspiracy, which the network later retracted (Hannity never apologized). Aaron Rich, speaking with Rossi, says fighting incessant trolls has left him unable to grieve his brother, even three years later.

Whether it’s Pizzagate, activating people into believing an outlandish pedophilia ring must be stopped, to Rich conspiracy theorists who feel they have access to privileged information, After Truth explores how much of disinformation’s power lies in human emotion. “Fake stories are often successful when they capture their audience’s hearts,” said Rossi. “What we’re trying to do in the film is to provide a different story that also appeals to people’s hearts, which is the pain and the devastation that’s caused to the victims of these stories.”

Putting a face on disinformation, however, means also looking at its perpetrators; After Truth includes interviews with or footage of noted conspiracy theorists, hucksters or far-right media personalities, including Jones and Jack Burkman, a notoriously incendiary Washington lobbyist who hosted a press conference in 2018 with bad-faith provocateur Jacob Wohl, meant to smear Robert Mueller with a sexual assault allegation that fell apart, somewhat thrillingly, on Rossi’s camera as the “victim” elects not to show up.

Talking to figures who believe all press is good press has been “the third rail of the project, and has been in the conversation among documentary film-makers who want to tackle this topic,” said Rossi. “How do we do this without giving oxygen to the liars and propagandists?” For Rossi, it was partly having someone like Burkman admit his cynicism, as in a 2017 interview in which he called disinformation a “tool of war”, like chemical weapons – if someone else can use it, he says, I may as well use it too. “And then also to combine observational film-making with context, to immediately rebut a lie and debunk it in the moment.” Journalists such as Silverman, CNN’s Oliver Darcy, Recode’s Kara Swisher and the New York Times’s Adam Goldman debunk false claims in real time and add crucial context to the film’s scope and timeline. “It’s a delicate balance to strike,” said Rossi, “but always make sure it’s not misleading and the truth is very clear.”

Ultimately, according to Stelter, when it comes to dispersing or de-escalating disinformation, “there’s no one solution, there’s no one right answer”. It’s understanding media literacy 101, it’s legislating responsibility for massive platforms of information, Facebook first among them. And in the midst of a once-in-a-generation pandemic in which correct, reliable information and public trust are now literally a matter of life and death, an understanding of the tools of disinformation may be more important than ever. “Disinformation in the sense that our information world is polluted is something we all have in common,” said Stelter. “It’s something we all share, and it’s a problem that we all collectively have to address.”

529,"A few days ago, the BBC reported that there were over 860 calls in the first week to a newly set up phone hotline that will deal specifically with sexual abuse claims for UK football players.

According to the BBC, there are now 17 different police forces investigating past, recent and current abuse claims.

The surging numbers of abuse claims come on the heels of former Newcastle United footballer David Eatock coming out five days ago and publicly claiming that a former coach, George Ormond, sexually abused David between 50-100 times as David was growing up.

David Eatock began speaking out after he saw another former footballer, Andy Woodward, come forward in an interview with The Guardian, which happened about about two weeks ago.

The police are encouraging others to come forward in hopes of snowballing the awareness around this sort of abuse that is often hidden and rarely talked about.

Clearly, with over 860 calls in the first week of a new hotline being setup, people are speaking out more and more.

If recent events hint towards what is happening on a global scale, we have only seen the beginning of what is to become known in regards to pedophilia and child/human trafficking.

On Sunday December 4th, The Independent reported that Scotland Yard has been given more money to investigate an “important new lead” in the case of the then 3 year old missing girl named Madeleine McCann.

Interestingly, the McCann family found out just this past June that former UK journalist Clement Freud, grandson of famous psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, had a villa less than a mile away from where Madeleine went missing back in 2007.

To add to it, Clement Freud was a known pedophile (formally exposed as one after he died).

Interestingly, it is now known thanks to the Wikileaks email dump, that the Podesta’s often visited Portugal and visited a friend named “Clem.” Could it be Clement Freud?

Though, just since they visited the same country that Madeleine went missing in doesn’t mean much. However, when the suspects’ images look nearly identical to John and Tony Podesta, one begins to question the official narrative.

And here is The Guardian’s official release of the suspect’s images:

It is interesting to note that right now we are seeing a tremendous surge in activity regarding what has become known as Pizza.

This refers to claims being made that the Podestas are involved in a massive, elite pedophilia syndicate, which has also implicated Comet Ping Pong, located in Washington D.C. (Allegedly Comet Ping Pong is located at the bottom of an upside down pentagram that is directly in line with the location of the White House).

With all of this activity and speculation about the Podesta’s and many other elites involved in this pedophile ring and their possible connection to Madeleine McCann, it is highly significant that Scotland Yard is now re-investigating the case of Madeleine due to new “important” lead.

Could the dots be connecting? We’ll see.

While some may wish to push all of this off as some massive “conspiracy” not based in reality, remember back to the beginning of this story when over 860 people called in during 1 week to report claims of former or current sexual abuse.

This is not some wild theory. These things happen and it is time we see it for what it is.

The more people that know about these things, as sick and terrible as they are, the quicker we can rescue those being trafficked and abused and bring healing to this entire situation.

In addition to recent claims, it has been reported by The Telegraph just two days ago that police are now investigating 15 different claims that Sir Edward Heath (now dead), sexually abused multiple children while he served as the Prime Minister’s armed protection officer.

Additionally, over the years, the Vatican has paid nearly $4 billion dollars to victims of pedophilia, which stemmed from clergy members abusing children.

We must also remember back to when it was alleged that former BBC broadcaster Jimmy Savile was sexually abusing children, but was put off as a “conspiracy theory” only until after he died, when literally hundreds of people came forward to prove that he did sexually abuse children.

Also, it has been said that the current New York Times CEO Mark Thompson helped to cover up the Jimmy Savile scandal, as Thompson worked at the BBC as the Director-General during a period where Savile was still abusing children, and even some abuse cases happened on live television.

While there is so much more that could be written about this topic, what is important to take away from this is that there is a lot of activity regarding pedophilia coming out into the public’s awareness.

There is a snowball effect taking place. Remember what the Buddha said:

415,"Populist narratives may go into overdrive and become conspirational. If the other politicians and not least the journalists do not work for the people, then whom do they work for? A foreign power or a secret elite? Conspiracy theorists turn up the distrust of the establishment, which could be run by the enemy, the others, and they use this distrust as fuel. Thus, conspiracy stories and theories have the same basic us-versus-them structure as the populist narratives, but taken to an even more extreme degree. The others are hidden in conspiracy thinking, and there is also an even greater tendency to perceive the world unnuanced as a battlefield for an epic battle between good and evil that only those in the know can see. A conspirational conviction may be defined as being a belief that an organization consisting of individuals or groups is plotting and acting in the dark in order to reach a specific goal that is often malignant.

Conspiracy theories are not necessarily wrong. Watergate is a prime example of a real conspiracy, and there are also more or less shady secret intelligence missions, corrupt actions, clandestine operations, and unsavory political deals that sometimes come to light but oftentimes go unnoticed.

). When a critical sense turns into conspirational thinking, alternative facts are swallowed hook, line, and sinker, as long as they come from alternative sources according to one’s taste and world view. This does not only go for the American right wing, although it continues to be repleted with conspiracy tendencies. Ever since the US Presidential Election 2016, factions of the American left wing have gone into conspirational mode and seen Russian infiltration here, there, and perhaps everywhere. The election result is not the only thing explained as the result of Russian meddling; Russia is even ascribed responsibility for the police violence that occurred in Ferguson (Fig. ). The belief in secret agendas may go into hyperdrive and become a paranoid perception of the world in which everything, give and take, are perceived as being run by the others. This turns critical thinking into conspiracy thinking, where motivated reasoning and fact resistance may thrive and misinformation is accepted uncritically as long as blame is attributed to the preferred quarters. An encompassing study looked into 2.3 million Facebook users’ information consumption and established that people with conspiracy convictions have a greater than average tendency to accept fake news and undocumented claims (Mocanua et al.). When a critical sense turns into conspirational thinking, alternative facts are swallowed hook, line, and sinker, as long as they come from alternative sources according to one’s taste and world view. This does not only go for the American right wing, although it continues to be repleted with conspiracy tendencies.

The election result is not the only thing explained as the result of Russian meddling; Russia is even ascribed responsibility for the police violence that occurred in Ferguson (Fig.).

The tendency to bring and share undocumented claims and fake stories uncritically, combined with distrust of the “mainstream media,” seems to be part and parcel of conspiracy theories.14

). Firstly, nothing happens by chance; there is always an (evil) will or intention behind it. Secondly, whatever happens must be connected to the rest, and that includes all news and facts that come to light. All of it forms part of a narrative in which everything fits, makes sense, and comes together in a coherent world view that often, however, loses its connection to reality due to its simplistic divide of the world into good or evil. If everything fits into a theory, most likely the theory itself does not square with reality (Fig. ). Three principles are characteristic of conspirational thinking (Barkun). Firstly, nothing happens by chance; there is always an (evil) will or intention behind it. Secondly, whatever happens must be connected to the rest, and that includes all news and facts that come to light. All of it forms part of a narrative in which everything fits, makes sense, and comes together in a coherent world view that often, however, loses its connection to reality due to its simplistic divide of the world into good or evil. If everything fits into a theory, most likely the theory itself does not square with reality (Fig.).

Thirdly, according to the conspiracy theories, nothing is as it seems, and the official story is certainly untrue. The motto from the TV series X-files sums it up: “Trust no one!” This thinking leads to enormous distrust in the common and established knowledge-producing and fact-checking bodies, among them the mainstream media, the educational system, and the science and research institutions. The usual channels for information are thought to be filtered and controlled by the plot or active participants in it. In this way, every piece of information that questions the conspiracy theory may be written off as being planted by those that conspire to mislead you. This is motivated reasoning run wild. The heavyweight conspiracy theories cannot be falsified, exactly because any attempt at falsifying them is perceived as a trap set by the others.

The more global and all-encompassing the conspiracy theory, the harder it is to shoot it down, but the more unrealistic it is as well. The heavyweight theories concerning super conspiracies, where everything is connected and controlled by a secret world elite or deep state, ascribe humans unrealistic capacities to make long-term, secret plans, carry them out successfully, and resist to brag about it. Some of the heavyweight theories turn into a sort of occultism in which those who control the world are not humans at all, but demigods, reptiles, aliens, or other supernatural beings. It takes supernatural powers to keep track of so much, have so many allies, and keep everything a secret.

The argument Trump used 5 years down the line, on May 31, 2017, when he withdrew the USA from the Paris Agreement, the United Nations accord that aims to lower greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change impacts, is composed out of the same basic conspirational melody. There is a suspicion of the others having shady intentions of undermining the American economy. These intentions differ from the official reason given, which is to mitigate the rise in temperature:

This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States. The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement — they went wild; they were so happy — for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage. A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.15 Apparently, the Paris Agreement is not about the climate at all. It is only a front, a shady official story that covers up villainous intentions of hitting the American economy. And it is a plan in which the whole world must have ganged up to carry out. If this was actually the case, then NASA would be part of the conspiracy. NASA describes man-made climate changes as a fact beyond any reasonable doubt: The evidence is too strong.16 But wait a minute. Was it not NASA who faked the moonlanding in a film studio? How can we trust them on anything? Apparently, the Paris Agreement is not about the climate at all. It is only a front, a shady official story that covers up villainous intentions of hitting the American economy. And it is a plan in which the whole world must have ganged up to carry out.

).17 If distrust in the knowledge institutions grows deep enough, it may end in a skepticism so comprehensive that even the fact that the Earth is a globe is not a given. This is the starting point for a growing movement called Flat Earth Society that insists the Earth is not a globe and argues that people think so erroneously due to the lies and photoshopped globe propaganda from a big villain, NASA. NASA is thought to have bribed every single astronaut to go along with the hoax and lie to the public (Fig.).

On this view, citizens, politicians, scientists, and teachers who believe the Earth is round are either misled or themselves consciously misleading the public. If you cannot trust anyone, then what you may know or come to know is very limited. Have you seen with your own eyes that the Earth is round? No, you haven’t. So how can you know for sure that it is? If suspicion and distrust metamorphose and win over people beyond small circles, it not only undermines science, enlightenment, efficient political action, and problem-solving. It undermines democracy itself.",mainstream,M0ce01,pizzagate
398,"This story was reported in partnership with The Investigative Fund and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting. Additional reporting: Aaron Sankin, Laura Starecheski, Michael Corey, Jaime Longoria and Jasper Craven.

The revelations overcame Edgar Maddison Welch like a hallucinatory fever. On December 1st, 2016, the father of two from Salisbury, North Carolina, a man whose pastimes included playing Pictionary with his family, tried to persuade two friends to join a rescue mission. Alex Jones, the Info-Wars host, was reporting that Hillary Clinton was sexually abusing children in satanic rituals a few hundred miles north, in the basement of a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant. Welch told his friends the “raid” on a “pedo ring” might require them to “sacrifice the lives of a few for the lives of many.” A friend texted, “Sounds like we r freeing some oppressed pizza from the hands of an evil pizza joint.” Welch was undeterred. Three days later, armed with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, a .38 handgun and a folding knife, he strolled into the restaurant and headed toward the back, where children were playing ping-pong. As waitstaff went table to table, whispering to customers to get out, Welch maneuvered into the restaurant’s kitchen. He shot open a lock and found cooking supplies. He whipped open another door and found an employee bringing in fresh pizza dough. Welch did not find any captive children – Comet Ping Pong does not even have a basement – but he did prove, if there were any lingering doubts after the election, that fake news has real consequences.

Welch’s arrest was the culmination of an election cycle dominated by fake news – and by attacks on the legitimate press. Several media outlets quickly traced the contours of what became known as Pizzagate: The claim that Hillary Clinton was a pedophile started in a Facebook post, spread to Twitter and then went viral with the help of far-right platforms like Breitbart and Info-Wars. But it was unclear whether Pizzagate was mass hysteria or the work of politicos with real resources and agendas. It took the better part of a year (and two teams of researchers) to sift through the digital trail. We found ordinary people, online activists, bots, foreign agents and domestic political operatives. Many of them were associates of the Trump campaign. Others had ties with Russia. Working together – though often unwittingly – they flourished in a new “post-truth” information ecosystem, a space where false claims are defended as absolute facts. What’s different about Pizzagate, says Samuel Woolley, a leading expert in computational propaganda, is it was “retweeted and picked up by some of the most powerful faces of American politics.”

The original Pizzagate Facebook post appeared on the evening of October 29th, 2016, a day after then-FBI Director James Comey announced that the bureau would be reopening its investigation into Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server while secretary of state. Data from the server had been found on electronics belonging to former Rep. Anthony Weiner (the husband of Clinton’s close aide Huma Abedin), who had been caught texting lewd messages to a 15-year-old. On Facebook, a user named Carmen Katz wrote, “My NYPD source said its much more vile and serious than classified material on Weiner’s device. The email DETAIL the trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary on their pedophile billionaire friend’s plane, the Lolita Express. Yup, Hillary has a well documented predilection for underage girls. . . . We’re talking an international child enslavement and sex ring.”

Katz’s Facebook profile listed her residence as Joplin, Missouri. With a link to a story headlined “Breaking: Hillary Clinton strategy memo leaked: ‘Steal yard signs,’ ” Katz posted, “You know how we handle yard sign theft or tampering in South Missouri? With a 3 prong garden hoe buried in the middle of the back.” We found no record of anyone with the name Carmen Katz in the entire state. But searching through her online activity, we noticed another clue: Every time she posted petitions on Change.org, such as “Put Donald Trump’s Face on Mount Rushmore,” the last signer was invariably Cynthia Campbell of Joplin. Campbell used the same profile picture as “Carmen Katz” on Facebook – that is, the same snapshot of the same cat.

For more than 20 years, a 60-year-old attorney named Cynthia Campbell has practiced law out of her bungalow-style home in Joplin. In April, I began trying to contact her, asking if she was behind the initial Pizzagate post. Within days, the Carmen Katz Facebook account disappeared. I went to Campbell’s house to try in person. A large NRA sticker adorned the screen door; on the porch was feline statuary and gardening equipment, including a three-pronged hoe. She didn’t answer but later texted and called me. Campbell said yes, she set up the Facebook account, but it was hacked two or three years ago. She never explicitly denied posting the comment that started Pizzagate. Instead, she told me to disregard the NRA sticker – she just “supports hunting.” She also claimed to be a rare Democrat in southwest Missouri. “You don’t say much,” she said. “You don’t stick signs out.”

Social-media accounts are routinely- hacked, but the next morning, when Campbell texted me 21 times, she sounded every bit like the user behind the original Carmen Katz post. “Stalking and harassing innocent people who have done nothing to you is wrong, evil and illegal,” she wrote. “You should be helping people get their lives and health back going through such nightmares, not piling on, harassing them, making them feel unsafe and preyed upon.” She threatened to report me to both the ACLU and Best Buy’s Geek Squad.

“[P]eople like you don’t give a shit that you destroy innocent humans’ lives,” she said. “Go back to your soul-sucking job. . . . You are fake news!”

It strains the imagination to think how Campbell – a cat lady in Missouri – had pieced together not only the story that Clinton was a sex-trafficking pedophile, but its details: NYPD officials, Weiner’s laptop, Jeffrey Epstein’s private jet. According to Clint Watts, a cyber and homeland-security expert at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, Katz fits neatly into a well-worn blueprint for disinformation campaigns. For a story to gain traction, propagandists plant false information on anonymous chat boards, hoping real people will pick it up and add a “human touch” to acts of digital manipulation. “If you want to sow a conspiracy, you seed it someplace – 4chan or Reddit is a perfect vehicle,” he says, and wait for someone like Katz to take the bait. “Someone or some group,” Watts says, “possibly took this unwitting woman and made her the source that they need.”

On a pair of anonymous message boards, we found several possible seeds of Pizzagate. On July 2nd, 2016, someone calling himself FBIAnon, who claimed to be a “high-level analyst and strategist” for the bureau, hosted an Ask Me Anything forum on 4chan. He claimed to be leaking government secrets – á la Edward Snowden – out of a love for country, but it wasn’t always clear which country he meant. At various times, he wrote, “Russia is more a paragon of freedom and nationalism than any other country” and “We are the aggressors against Russia.” FBIAnon’s secrets were about the Department of Justice’s inquiry into the Clinton Foundation, which federal prosecutors never formalized. “Dig deep,” he wrote. “Bill and Hillary love foreign donors so much. They get paid in children as well as money.”

Another possible germ of Pizzagate appeared online about 10 hours before Katz posted her story on Facebook. TheeRANT describes itself as a message board for “New York City cops speaking their minds.” Virtually everyone on the site uses an identity-masking screen name. Favorite topics include police body cameras (bad) and George Soros (worse). On October 29th, 2016, someone calling himself “Fatoldman” posted that he had a “hot rumor” about the FBI investigation. 

 “[T]he feds were forced to reopen the hillary email case [because] apparently the NYPD sex crimes unit was involved in the weiner case,” Fatoldman wrote. “On his laptop they saw emails. [T]hey notified the FBI. Feds were afraid that NYPD would go public so they had to reopen or be accused of a coverup.”

Someone posted the news to a law enforcement Facebook group. From there, a user called Eagle Wings (@NIVIsa4031) posted it to Twitter. Eagle Wings’ profile picture shows a smiling middle-aged woman above the description “USAF Vet believes Freedom Soars.” Among her more influential followers are former deputy assistant to President Trump Sebastian Gorka and former national security adviser Gen. Michael Flynn, who actually shared a separate Eagle- Wings tweet last year. Eagle Wings’ enthusiastic following likely has something to do with membership in “Trumps WarRoom,” a private group of online activists who share and amplify political messages. Participants told Politico’s Shawn Musgrave that hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of pro-Trump rooms coalesced during the campaign. “The members aren’t stereotypical trolls,” Musgrave tells me. “Most are baby boomers.” A lot are women from the Midwest.

But Eagle Wings is not a typical political enthusiast, says Woolley, who directs research at the Institute for the Future’s Digital Intelligence Lab. She tweets too often (more than 50,000 times since November 2015) to too many followers (120,000 as of November 2017). “Without a shadow of a doubt,” he says, “Eagle Wings is a highly automated account [and] part of a bot network” – a centrally controlled group of social-media accounts. To explain how they work, Ben Nimmo, a fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, uses a shepherding analogy. “A message that someone or some organization wants to ‘trend’ is typically sent out by ‘shepherd’ accounts,” he says, which often have large followings and are controlled by humans. The shepherds’ messages are amplified by ‘sheepdog’ accounts, which are also run by humans but can be default-set “to boost the signal and harass critics.” At times, the shepherds personally steer conversations, but they also deploy automation, using a kind of Twitter cruise control to retweet particular keywords and hashtags. Together, Nimmo says, the shepherds and sheepdogs guide a herd of bots, which “mindlessly repost content in the digital equivalent of sheep rushing in the same direction and bleating loudly.”

Whether Katz repeated something a herd of bots was bleating, or repackaged tidbits found on other parts of the Internet, her Facebook post was the “human touch” that helped the fake news story go viral. The “tell,” says Watts, was what happened next. Most of us post into Internet oblivion. But about 12 hours after Katz shared her story, a Twitter user named @DavidGoldbergNY tweeted a screenshot of her post, twice – adding, “I have been hearing the same thing from my NYPD buddies too. Next couple days will be -interesting!”

On Twitter, @DavidGoldbergNY described himself as a “Jew, Lawyer & New Yorker.” The account went live around the time of the Republican National Convention, in July 2016, posting divisive tweets like “Attacking the 1 percent is attacking 43 percent of the Jewish community.” The account’s profile picture – a man with a nose Photoshopped to look very large and hooked – has been used online for more than a decade. Based on the limited threads that have been archived, Woolley says, @DavidGoldbergNY appears to have been, like Eagle Wings, “highly automated” and part of “an organized effort” – possibly a bot network – to spread disinformation. One of @DavidGoldbergNY’s tweets about the Katz Facebook post was retweeted 6,369 times.

What’s nearly impossible to tell is who ran @DavidGoldbergNY. The handle is not among the 2,752 Twitter accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency, a disinformation shop run by the Kremlin, which the House Intelligence Committee released in November. And Twitter has yet to make public the handles of an additional 36,746 bot accounts its attorney Sean Edgett told Congress have “characteristics we used to associate an account with Russia.” In any case, Russia is not the only one playing this game. “We’ve also had sources tell us that using bot networks has become a common practice among U.S. political campaigns,” says Woolley, a practice that is difficult to trace. “They do it with subcontractors,” he explains. “And the Federal Election Commission doesn’t require reporting for subcontractors.” One thing that does stand out, he adds, is “the more sophisticated bot nets, the ones that are successful at spreading stories, are built by people with a lot of resources. In our experience, across multiple different countries, the people that have deep pockets are the powerful political actors.”

According to a sample of tweets with Pizzagate or related hashtags provided by Filippo Menczer, a professor of informatics at Indiana University, Pizzagate was shared roughly 1.4 million times by more than a quarter of a million accounts in its first five weeks of life – from @DavidGoldbergNY’s tweet to the day Welch showed up at Comet Ping Pong. The vast majority of tweeters in our sample, just 10 percent of all possible hits, posted about the story only a few times. But more than 3,000 accounts in our set tweeted about Pizzagate five times or more. Among these were dozens of users who tweet so frequently – up to 900 times a day – that experts believe they were likely highly automated. Even more striking: 22 percent of the tweets in our sample were later deleted by the user. This could be a sign, Woolley says, of “someone sweeping away everything so that we can’t follow the trail.”

Next, we decided to cross-reference the most frequent Pizzagate tweeters with a list of 139 handles associated with Trump campaign staffers, advisers and surrogates. We also ran our entire sample against the list of accounts linked to Russia’s Internet Research Agency. We found that at least 14 Russia-linked accounts had tweeted about Pizzagate, including @Pamela_Moore13, whose avatar is, aptly, an anonymous figure wrapped in an American flag; that account has been retweeted by such prominent Trump supporters as Donald Trump Jr., Ann Coulter and Roger Stone, the political operative who recommended Paul Manafort as Trump’s campaign manager. (Special Counsel Robert Mueller recently indicted Manafort for money laundering as part of his investigation into possible collusion with Russian efforts to influence the presidential race.) “Well! Well! Well!” “Pamela Moore” tweeted on November 19th, 2016, above the fake news headline “FBI: Rumors About Clinton Pedophile Ring Are True.”

The campaign’s engagement went far deeper. We found at least 66 Trump campaign figures who followed one or more of the most prolific Pizzagate tweeters. Michael Caputo, a Trump adviser who tweeted frequently about Clinton’s e-mails, followed 146 of these accounts; Corey Stewart, Trump’s campaign chair in Virginia, who lost a tight primary race for governor in June, followed 115; Paula White-Cain, Trump’s spiritual adviser, followed 71; Pastor Darrell Scott, a prominent member of Trump’s National Diversity Coalition, followed 33. Flynn’s son, Michael Flynn Jr., who followed 58 of these accounts, famously took the bait and was ousted from the Trump transition team in early December after tweeting, “Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it’ll remain a story.”

Many of the Pizzagate tweeters had the characteristics of political bots – Twitter handles made up of random or semi-random letters and numbers and twin passions for conservative politics and pets (puppies and kitties win audience, Watts says). Others were all too human. Crystal Kemp, a 50-year-old grandmother who lives in Confluence, Pennsylvania, tweeted about the story more than 4,000 times in five weeks. I reached out to her via Facebook to ask why. “Didn’t want Hillary to win at any cost,” Kemp tells me, “but liked Trump from day one. I don’t really know that much about the Pizzagate thing. Everything I tweeted or retweeted was stuff that I found through my own research or from another follower.”

Kemp tweeted links to articles from well-known right-wing sites like Fox News and Breitbart. But she also shared stories from obscure outlets like ConservativeDailyPost.com, which appears to be among the fake-news sites that operated from Macedonia during the election. Buzzfeed had found that teenagers in the deindustrialized town of Veles published pro-Trump stories because they were profitable as click-bait. When I traveled to Macedonia last summer, Borce Pejcev, a computer programmer who has set up dozens of fake-news sites – for around 100 euros each – said it wasn’t quite that simple. Macedonians don’t invent fake news stories, he told me. “No one here knows anything about American politics. They copy and paste from American sites, maybe try to come up with more dramatic headline.” Fox News, TruePundit.com, DailyCaller.com, InfoWars and Breitbart, he said, were among the Macedonians’ most common source material (“Breit-bart was best”). Macedonians would’ve happily copied anti-Trump fake news too, he said. “Unfortunately, there weren’t any good U.S. pro-Clinton fake-news sites to copy and paste.”

That was exactly how the right-wing-media ecosystem worked during the 2016 campaign, explains Yochai Benkler, who directs the Berkman-Klein Center for the Internet and Society at Harvard. After the election, he and his colleagues mapped about 2 million campaign-news stories. He found that far-right-media outlets were organized extremely tightly around Breitbart and, to a lesser degree, FoxNews.com. “The right paid attention to right-wing sites, and the more right-wing they were, the more attention they got,” Benkler says. More extreme sites would distort and exaggerate the claims, but they would use a “relatively- credible source” such as Breitbart as a validator. “Because they were repeated not only on the very far-fringe sites but also by sites that are at the center of this cluster, the right-wing disinformation circulated and amplified very quickly.”

Douglas Hagmann is a self-employed private investigator and host of HagmannReport.com, a webcast that exposes the “New World Order agenda.” It was Hagmann who – four days after Carmen Katz first posted the story and six days before Election Day – brought Pizzagate from social media to fake news’ largest stage. On the November 2nd broadcast of InfoWars, arguably the most influential conspiracy-theory outlet in the country, with 7.7 million unique visitors to its website a month, Alex Jones asked Hagmann to tell his audience what sources had revealed about the e-mails recovered on Weiner’s computer. “[T]he most disgusting aspect of this is the sexual angle,” Hagmann said. “I don’t want to be graphic or gross here. . . . Based on my source, Hillary did in fact participate on some of the junkets on the Lolita Express.”

The story took off. Google Trends measures interest in topics among the 1.17 billion users of its search engine on a 0-100 scale. On October 29th, the day Katz posted the story on Facebook, searches for “Hillary” and “pedophile” ranked zero. Ninety-six hours later, when Hagmann “broke” the story on InfoWars, they scored 100.

In April, Hagmann agreed to meet with me for a look at his “courtroom-ready” documents on Pizzagate. His split-level home in Erie, Pennsylvania, is on a quiet leafy street. In the front yard, there’s a small waterfall, a rock garden and a large sign warning that the place is under surveillance. He greeted me in the foyer wearing a suit and tie, his hair slicked back with Brylcreem, and led the way downstairs to his basement broadcast center.

In October 2016, Hagmann claimed, he “communicated” with a friend who knows someone affiliated with the NYPD. The friend of the friend had been on the “task force” that secured Weiner’s computer and had copied documents onto a thumb drive “proving” Clinton and her associates were involved in pedophilia. “Now, I can’t get him to give me the thumb drive,” he said. “Or even admit to the fact that he had it.” When I asked how he knew the files existed, he said, “I trust my source.”

Hagmann then launched into a synopsis of three decades of rumors that Clinton and her associates are lesbians and perverts. He started with the claims of Cathy O’Brien, a conspiracy theorist from Muskegon, Michigan, who alleged that while held as a CIA sex slave, she was forced to service Hillary Clinton. Hagmann moved on to Clinton’s “close” relationship with Weiner’s estranged wife, and the allegation that her campaign manager, John Podesta, and his brother Tony resemble sketches of the suspects in the 2007 disappearance of four-year-old Madeleine McCann in Portugal. “Sorry,” Hagmann stopped himself. “I know this case is difficult. Circumstantial.”

When I asked if he had verified anything, Hagmann shuffled some papers, lifting one sheet by a corner, like a poker player. With apparent reluctance, he turned over a color copy of an image showing a clean, uninjured boy wearing a green T-shirt in a dog cage. The child could have been playing or held hostage. “That might be a disturbing image,” I said. “But I don’t see what it has to do with Hillary Clinton.” He shrugged. “You could say I have dog crap for answers and dog crap for sources,” he said, adding later, “I hope you don’t think this was a waste.”

The following month, at Awaken to the Shakin’, a Bible conference in Gurnee, Illinois, Hagmann presented his evidence to an audience of about 40 middle-aged churchgoers. His courtroom-ready exhibits included the Wikipedia entry for “fake news,” the New Oxford Dictionary definition of “post-truth,” a quote by John Wayne, a photo of people sitting on a couch wearing horse masks, a photo of scars on the fingers of John Podesta. And the kicker – a photo of a decapitated body that Hagmann said was a victim of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer and another of a sculpture by Louise Bourgeois in Tony Podesta’s home, ironically titled “The Arch of Hysteria.” The two images, he said, are shockingly similar.

All the same, two days after Hagmann’s appearance on InfoWars, Erik Prince, the brother of Trump’s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, “confirmed” that the terrible rumor was true in an interview on Breitbart. Prince is best known as the founder of the private military company Blackwater USA, whose mercenaries shot and killed 17 unarmed Iraqi civilians in Baghdad’s Nisour Square in 2007. He donated $250,000 to the Trump campaign and became an informal adviser on intelligence and security issues, traveling to the Seychelles during the transition to meet with a Kremlin associate in an attempt to create back-channel communications between Moscow and the president-elect. On Breitbart radio, Prince painted a picture sure to stir the far right. “Because of Weinergate and the sexting scandal, the NYPD started investigating,” he said. “They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money-laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times.”

The right-wing-media system went into overdrive. Prince’s story was picked up and embellished by other right-wing outlets, and made its way back to InfoWars that afternoon. Citing Prince’s interview, Jones fumed, “When I think about all the children Hillary Clinton has personally murdered and chopped up and raped . . . yeah, you heard me right. Hillary Clinton has personally murdered children.” Jones’ video was viewed on YouTube more than 427,000 times. Prince’s interview was shared another 81,000 times. On Twitter, the numbers were increasing exponentially- – 300 percent in just six days.

Long before October 28th, 2016, when Comey wrote to Congress that the FBI would be reexamining Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, her campaign knew they had a huge e-mail problem. In focus groups, voters conflated the case with the e-mails Russian operatives had hacked from the Democratic National Committee and Podesta, her campaign manager. Though U.S. intelligence agencies now agree that a Kremlin–associated group, Fancy Bear, hacked the e-mails – which WikiLeaks began posting less than an hour after The Washington Post published Trump’s “grab them by the pussy” video – a senior Clinton campaign staffer tells me, “There was just more voyeuristic interest in the content of the e-mails than in how they were obtained.”

The confusion was encouraged online by the likes of @DavidGoldbergNY. The e-mails on Weiner’s laptop had nothing to do with Podesta’s Gmail account, but one of his tweets of the Katz post included #podestaemails23. “That hashtag is a flag,” Woolley says. “It suggests that @DavidGoldbergNY is attempting to get people to look at something.” On message boards, amateur sleuths searched for encoded evidence in the Podesta e-mails. A particular source of fascination was an invitation from the performance artist Marina Abramovic for Podesta to attend a “Spirit Cooking dinner.” Allegations started circulating that Clinton consumed semen, breast milk and menstrual blood.

The story still hadn’t penetrated Clinton’s campaign headquarters. They’d become inured to the avalanche of fake news – the rumors that she was on her deathbed, funding ISIS, even dissed by the pope. But when a Clinton campaign staffer noticed “Podesta Spirit Cooking Emails Reveal Clinton’s Inner Circle as Sex Cult with Connections to Human Trafficking” on DangerandPlay.com become “Podesta Practices Occult Magic” on the Drudge Report, and then saw Alex Jones shouting that Clinton “is an abject, psychopathic demon from hell,” who “smell[s] like sulfur,” he went straight into Podesta’s office at the campaign’s Brooklyn headquarters. “You’re not going to believe it,” the aide told him. “Now you’re a fucking witch.”

It got even weirder after users on 8chan read a Podesta e-mail that revealed that Democratic activist David Brock had dated the owner of Comet Ping Pong pizzeria, James Alefantis. The citizen investigators considered Brock their archenemy – he’d founded Correct the Record, a Super PAC that defended Clinton against defamation by online trolls. Suddenly, they saw sinister meaning in any mention of pizza; for instance, the first letters in the words “cheese pizza” are the same as in “child porn.”

Until November 2016, the Pizzagate hashtag had mostly referred to Trump’s use of a fork and knife to eat pizza. But on November 4th, two days after Hagmann’s appearance on InfoWars, Cassandra Fairbanks, then a reporter for Sputnik News (which U.S. intelligence says spreads Kremlin-directed- disinformation), tweeted, “I’ve literally spent the last hour wondering if podesta ingested sperm mixed with breast milk with his brother.” In response, another user, @GodlessNZ, appears to have launched the hashtag: “Tweets assembling under #JohnMolesta and maybe #PizzaGate.”

That day, Alefantis got a phone call from a reporter at The Washington City Paper seeking a comment about a rumor going viral on Reddit. “What’s Reddit?” Alefantis asked.

It was just beginning. Even as the election came and went, several Twitter accounts tweeted exclusively about Pizzagate to a number of alt-right “influencers” – among them InfoWars and Brittany Pettibone, one of a handful of alt-right “girls” who regularly appear at the movement’s events. At least one single-minded account, @Pizza_Gate, likely caught the attention of Mehmet Ali Önel, a Turkish TV anchor. The network Önel works for is linked to the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdoan, which was facing international condemnation (including from the Obama State Department) for proposing a law that would risk decriminalizing pedophilia for offenders who married their victims. Önel, who has 196,000 Twitter followers, was one of dozens of Turkish commentators who claimed Americans had no right calling out Turkey for sex crimes with Pizzagate erupting in their own capital. One of the most shared Pizzagate tweets was posted by the anchor on November 16th. Roughly translated, it reads, “USA #PizzaGate shaken by the pedophilia scandals.”

Among the users who picked up the thread was Jack Posobiec, a well-known alt-right troll whom Trump himself has retweeted. During the campaign, Posobiec was special-projects director for Citizens for Trump, a never-officially-organized voter-fraud prevention group. Several hours after Önel sent his November 16th tweet, Posobiec went to investigate Comet Ping Pong and another nearby pizzeria. Live-streaming the visit on Periscope, he described evidence of “what’s really going on” – a double pane of glass near an oven, security cameras, a texting cashier. Posobiec paused, worrying his viewers might not understand the situation. “It’s like in the movie Jurassic Park,” he said. “Nedry had the shaving cream bottle. And you could press the top and a little bit of shaving cream came out. . . . The bottom part is where they had the dinosaur embryos.”

The Twittersphere went wild. The previous day, our sample indicates there were roughly 6,000 tweets about Pizzagate. Now, it was closer to 55,000. Alefantis tried and failed to get Facebook and Twitter to remove the posts. (Both companies declined to comment for this story.) When the restaurant started getting death threats, Alefantis called the police, then the FBI, and got nowhere. “It turns out you can say anything about anyone online,” he says. “It’s your First Amendment right to terrorize.”

Alefantis thought he’d finally scored a victory when The New York Times published an article debunking Pizzagate. He learned what the Clinton campaign found out too late. As Harvard’s Benkler puts it, “The right-wing-media ecosystem had become so hyperpartisan, so self-referential and so superinsular it often simply ignored information that’s disconfirming.” Instead, right-wing social media referenced mainstream coverage as a way to “legitimate” their claims. On November 21st, the day the Times published its story, our sample shows Twitter traffic about Pizzagate hit unprecedented levels: some 120,000 tweets.

Trolls on message boards began posting whole “dossiers” of private information about Comet Ping Pong employees and top Democrats, down to the movies that Podesta ordered on Netflix. On November 22nd, when Reddit banned a Pizzagate subreddit for posting obviously stolen private information, a moderator responded, “We have all made life insurance videos. We have all vowed to continue this fight. You have only increased our number. This morning we were numerous, tonight we are legion.” About 145,000 tweets flew that day.

The next day, InfoWars posted a video called “Pizzagate Is Real.” On November 27th, Jones spent a half-hour explaining the story. “Something’s being covered up,” he told his audience. “All I know is, God help us, we’re in the hands of pure evil.” Hours later, he released another video, “Down the #Pizzagate Rabbit Hole.” On December 1st, the show posted “Pizzagate: The Bigger Picture.” In North Carolina, Edgar Maddison Welch was obsessively watching much of this coverage. By the evening of December 4th, he was in solitary confinement in a Washington, D.C., jail.

Nearly a year after the election, in three separate hearings with members of Congress, executives from Twitter, Facebook and Google took turns expressing contrition for hosting Russia’s attempts to manipulate U.S. public opinion. A Facebook vice president said it “pains us as a company” that foreign actors “abused our platform.” Twitter’s general counsel said he too was “troubled” that the power of Twitter was misused.

“There was this concept of ‘Social media is going to save democracy,’ ” Woolley tells me. “Twitter didn’t envision that powerful political actors were going to use social media in attempts to spread propaganda.” Among the many strange aspects of Pizzagate was the fact that the story went viral after the election. All of the Russia-linked tweets we found were sent after November 8th. Bot networks appear to be tweeting out the hashtag to this day. Woolley suggests it could be an attempt to “bolster” Trump’s position, to “win over people’s hearts and minds.” Clinton had lost the presidency, he says, but “she was not done in terms of her ability to be a representative of democratic ideals, or of the ideals that were oppositional to Donald Trump.”

Watts, the cyber-security expert, doesn’t know if Russia and the Trump campaign colluded on Pizzagate, or anything else. But both camps were clearly opportunistic. “You can’t say that there was no indigenous support,” he says. “The Russians don’t create this whole [alt-right] movement. They just harness it.” Of course, so did Trump. But Watts believes the Russians, at least, are playing for much higher stakes than one presidential election. “The goal is to create division between communities,” he says. “It is making you not trust the state. It’s eroding the mandate of elected officials so that they can’t govern properly. It’s making people want to not participate in democracy because they think it’s corrupt. It’s getting you to either believe that it’s all stacked against you or you just opt out altogether because you don’t know what to believe. When you don’t know what to believe, you’ll believe anything.”

1263,"Amanda Knox heads to Italy this weekend to “face her fears” where much of the population still think she’s guilty of murdering her roommate 12 years ago. Like Steve Bannon, Knox is another American export Italians can’t seem to keep out.

But the visit is a good time to remember how the online phenomenon of Amanda Knox was a portent of the Age of Trump, with its elevation and celebration of unreason, as the digital age linked and energized what most charitably could be called “suspicious minds.”

In 2007, Twitter was just coming online, with 5,000 Tweets per day. Facebook was still in its data-harvesting infancy, with less than 100 million users. But the Amanda Knox story tapped into something previously inchoate, a vein of irrationality, rage, misogyny, pettiness and paranoia that — as the world has since come to understand — has bubbled along in the human species, unshared and unspoken, until it was enabled and amplified by the World Wide Web.

On the night after Halloween 2007, British student Meredith Kercher was murdered in her home in the Italian hill town Perugia, during what was most likely a burglary gone wrong, a tragedy I investigated for the 2012 book The Fatal Gift of Beauty: The Italian Trial of Amanda Knox. Knox, Kercher’s oddball American hippie roommate, immediately attracted the authorities’ attention, for being on the crime scene when they arrived and acting in ways they found inappropriate, like making out with her boyfriend and doing yoga stretches. Local police, racing to solve the case as students fled the university town, made a mess of the crime scene and committed forensic blunders in the lab, among other mistakes. The local magistrate, afflicted with indigenous superstitions, proclaimed the murder a Satanic rite, setting off a global media feeding frenzy — and something else that, in hindsight, was just the beginning.

The Amanda Knox phenomenon marked the first time a bizarre cult of credulity emerged online, with tens of thousands of people energetically subscribing to the most heinous possible scenario, while refusing to accept more reasonable alternatives. A now-familiar scenario played out: Vicious social media swarms led by trolls using online pseudonyms. Accusations of fake news hurled at reputable outlets, while demonstrably fake news was published regularly. There was doxxing. Lawmen attacked as shills. Journalists accused of “being on the payroll.” A theory in which everyone is connected by money or in the case of the Magistrate’s version of the case, by deviant secret cults with midnight membership lists who meet by the light of the moon.

Anyone who witnessed the phenomenon could not have been surprised by Pizzagate, which revealed millions of people willing to believe Hillary Clinton ran a Satanic child sex ring beneath a popular Washington, D.C. pizza parlor. All the while, many of these same people refused to acknowledge the testimony of legal and ethics experts like former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, or former FBI Director James Comey, regarding the corruption of Donald Trump.

The online spectacle that was the Knox phenomenon played out mostly in what was then called “the blogosphere.” Private citizens with dubious qualifications, strong opinions and, apparently, lots of time on their hands, set up websites devoted to parsing the case from the two opposing sides, the innocent or the guilty — or, as the Italians called them, the innocentisti and colpevolisti.

Like the Pizzagates that would follow, the Knox conspiracy had its own version of a “deep state” — this one, a supposedly vast and fantastically well-funded American public relations machine churning away, producing lying journalists and lying defense experts for the Knox family. The family was in fact, a middle class and not very media-savvy clan stumbling around in a web of morning television producers eager to for family “gets.”

The case also featured allegations of mental instability in a leader who would insist upon his fantastically excellent health. A Seattle newspaper criticized the case and quoted unnamed legal experts who reportedly believed Magistrate Giuliano Mignini to be “mentally unstable.” Eleven days later, Mignini filed a defamation claim. “I am quite a healthy man,” the BBC reported Mignini as saying. “I don’t go to the doctor much, and I have never visited a psychologist.”

The investigation, trial and appeals dragged on for more than seven years before the charges were finally thrown out in 2015. But by then, tens of thousands of commenters on both sides of the innocent-guilty divide had trolled each other about the main characters in the trial as if they knew them personally, and could see into their minds and read there the vilest or purest of motives.

Peggy Ganong, for example, a Seattle-based French translator who operated a website called Perugia Murder File, told me that she became convinced that Amanda Knox was guilty after looking at a photograph and deciding that Knox “looked like a killer.” The site published translations of legal documents, and photos of Knox and family members with snide captions. Ganong, whose lived a few blocks from Knox’s family, moderated discussion under the online name “Skeptical Bystander,” but was eventually outed, and filed a complaint to police, saying she was being harassed.

PMF has gone dark, but another particularly virulent site remains online and still going after Knox. True Justice for Meredith Kercher, (TJMK) was founded by a New Jersey-based British American named Peter Quenell who told me he was a financier and claimed to have consulted for the United Nations.

No pro-Knox activity was too small to escape his notice. Quenell once posted the website and pictures of the principal of a school where a teacher and classroom had created a video in support of Amanda Knox. Piling on, Ganong’s website encouraged members to write emails and to send letters to the teacher.

For a while, the TJMK site amplified articles by a fake forensic expert, calling herself Miss Represented, who opined regularly on Amanda Knox’s psychopathy. When I found out she was a young employee of a social media firm based in the U.K., she begged me not to use her name, writing: “Miss Represented was only ever supposed to be a place for my own reflections, some of them I still stand by, some of them I’ve rethought as I’ve gotten a little older and bit more mature.”

As Knox was convicted, and then released after an appeal, TJMK’s followers trolled and insulted bloggers arguing that Amanda Knox and her boyfriend has been railroaded. An army of avid self-styled CSI experts emerged from basements to join threads debating evidence, studying bloody photos, sometimes even enlarging and publishing horrifying police photographs of Kercher’s body — photos released to journalists by lawyers involved in the case.

Like the right wing fringe “journalists” and online avatars who purvey fake news now — including undercover videographer James Keefe, far-right internet troll Jacob Wohl, and anonymous conspiracy provocateur, the amorphous entity known as Q-Anon — the bloggers sometimes seemed to have access to real information or real people in the case, including sensitive court documents and maybe even access to the prosecutor himself.

The story was always riddled with alternative facts. I went to Italy assuming I was going to write a book about why an American girl turned into Charles Manson. After a month on the ground in Italy, I realized many reported “facts” were not in the police record in Italy. At one point, I emailed Quenell to ask where he had learned that Knox and Sollecito were found with a mop and bucket outside the bloody crime scene. He had reported that but it was nowhere in the official record, and not even the prosecutor would confirm it.

Quenell shot me one of the scarier emails I’ve received — as a female political journalist I’ve had my share — about he was going to “train his scope” on my apartment in Manhattan, closing with “how are the kiddies?”

In Italy, the Committee to Protect Journalists was so alarmed by police and prosecutorial attacks on journalists that it formally objected in a letter to the Italian judiciary. Perugia police forcibly entered one Italian innocentisti blogger’s apartment, without a warrant or showing their badges, shoved him to the ground, struck him, handcuffed him, and climbed on top of him, crushing his air supply, according to CPJ. The organizations also noted that Mignini had a history of hauling in or charging journalists whose coverage displeased him. He imprisoned a veteran crime reporter, threw an American writer out of the country, and filed criminal defamation lawsuits against Italian and American publications that questioned his theory of the Knox case.

Now, the American president has called journalists “the enemy of the people,” individual journalists have been subjected to obscene verbal abuse at his rallies and newsrooms were forced to hire extra security in the wake of one massacre. Reporters Without Borders dropped the U.S below Botswana and Romania in its annual ranking for press freedom this year because of an “intense climate of fear.”

The Trumpification of the public discourse that we are used to now — the toxic haze of conspiracy theories, the frothing, vicious online partisanship, shrieks of ‘fake news’ at messengers delivering real information and the abuse of experts — was not the norm as recently as 10 years ago. But the Amanda Knox phenomenon previewed what the entire internet would become.

Italy’s highest court threw out the conviction in 2015. This year, the European Court of Human Rights ordered the Italians to pay Knox damages for Perugia’s bad police work. The case against Knox is now widely believed to have been a case of wrongful imprisonment. But for millions, that remains fake news.

788,"Followers of QAnon were spotted at President Donald Trump's rally in Tampa on Tuesday night, wearing t-shirts and waving signs that read 'we are Q' and indicating the online conspiracy theorists are moving from the internet to the campaign trail.

The QAnon conspiracy theory - said to have been started by someone in the Trump administration although that has not been proven - has perpetuated talk of a 'deep state' and emerged from the 'Pizzagate' plot that claimed without evidence top Democrats were running a pedophilia ring.

Scattered throughout the audience in the Florida State Fairgrounds Expo Hall were Trump supporters showing their support for QAnon.

One man and woman wore matching white T-shirts with the YouTube logo inside a giant 'Q.' The video website came under criticism this week for becoming a platform for the conspiracy theories, who used the site's facilities to spread baseless claims that some Hollywood celebrities are pedophiles.

The rally also had a thread on 8chan, an anonymous image board also known as Infinitechan or Infinitychan, The Washington Post reported.

The president did not acknowledge the group or its followers in his remarks but he has touted conspiracy theories in the past, such as his claim that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States and how he tried to tie Sen. Ted Cruz's father to the man who assassinated President John Kennedy.

Other prominent names have bought into QAnon or acted upon a post from it.

Porn star Stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenatti sought police assistance after the promoter of the conspiracy theory posted a photo of a man outside of his office to the message-board 8chan.

Avenatti posted a version of the photo on Twitter in an appeal to the public for information.

'We are trying to identify the man in this picture, which was taken outside my office yesterday (Sun) afternoon,' Avenatti wrote. 'We will NOT be intimidated into stopping or changing our course.'

Actress Roseanne Barr has posted on twitter ideas and theories that have roots in QAnon.

Also known as 'The Storm', the QAnon theory is based on a series of anonymous and highly cryptic posts on the message board 4Chan, which purport to be written by a high-level insider at the Trump White House.

Q is a reference to 'Q-clearance', the Department of Energy security classification that offers the broadest level of access to Top Secret and Secret Restricted Data granted by the US government.

Though Q's posts are sometimes cryptic to the point of nonsense, in broad strokes the theory maintains that Trump is locked in a secret battle with 'evil' elements at the highest level of government.

Trump himself has reference battles against the 'deep state' - employees in the government he claims are working against his administration.

One conspiracy theory that inspired 'Q' was Pizzagate, purporting that top-level Democrats are engaged in satanic child sex abuse and child sex trafficking that included the involvement of Washington D.C. pizza restaurant Comet Ping Pong.

One of Q's only specific predictions, that Hillary Clinton's campaign manager John Podesta would be arrested on November 3, did not come to pass.

Nevertheless, the theory fired the imaginations of many who envision The Storm as an imminent domestic military crackdown and purge targeting the Trump Administration's foes.

Additionally, some interpreters of the conspiracy theory maintain that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is secretly working for Trump, preparing tens of thousands of sealed indictments targeting agents of the 'deep state' and allies of Clinton.

Fans of the QAnon theory, who call themselves anons, have spent countless hours piecing together the 'crumbs' dropped in the anonymous posts, which began in October.

As one fan explained in a post shared by Q on Monday: 'REAL ANON'S are here as we follow the EVIDENCE (documented verifiable evidence), we are building the TRUTH of our HISTORY so we can expose and dismantle the corruption that has PLAGUED our world for millennia.'

'WE are NOT about violence, subversion or control. WE are simply providing FACT based information FREE of charge to the WORLD,' the anon added.",mainstream,M184c0,pizzagate

636,"A report reveals the controversial face recognition software Clearview AI was developed with help from far-right extremists.

The Huffington Post claims founder Hoan Ton-That has close ties with several extremists, attended dinners organized by alt-right groups and had employees famous for hate speech.

It includes Charles Johnson, owner of a crowdfunding platform for white supremacists and Jack Posobiec, who led the Pizzagate campaign, along with Peter Thiel and his associate Jeff Giesa who is said to donate to alt-right causes, the Huffington Post claims.

The report claims to have videos, messages and emails linking the Clearview founder to these individuals as well as evidence suggesting the technology was designed specifically to 'identify every illegal alien in the country.'

Ton-That has commented on these allegations in an email to DailyMail.com, stating: 'I am not a white supremacist or an anti-semite, nor am I sympathetic to any of those views.'

'They are abhorrent and I reject them wholly and without reservation.'

'To those who have read my words in the Huffington Post article, I deeply apologize for them.'

Clearview identifies people by cross-referencing their mugshot with its mammoth image archive, which has sent chills up the backs of privacy campaigners since it began selling its service to police.

The system is said to have a three-billion-strong database of social media photographs includes pictures which are private or have been deleted.

And the mobile app is capable of matching names to faces with a tap of a touchscreen.

Clearview AI came under fire earlier this year when reports revealed it was lending its services US law enforcement agencies including the FBI to help hunt down suspects or search for illegal immigrants.

The firm's website says its technology has 'helped law enforcement track down hundreds of at-large criminals, including pedophiles, terrorists and sex traffickers'.

But the app raises questions about privacy and the potential for it to be used for evil.

However, it appears privacy and security are the least of the firm's problems.

Ton-That grew up in Australia with his Vietnamese family before moving to the US aged 19 and later co-founding Clearview AI.

A well-known hacker, Ton-That made a name for himself in 2009 by creating a computer worm that stole Gmail users' login credentials.

Six years later, he was rubbing elbows with those in the far-right who were helping Trump get into office.

I am a proud American of Vietnamese and Australian descent. I am an immigrant to this country, which I support and dearly love, in large part because of its diversity and acceptance of people regardless of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation. I am not a white supremacist or an anti-semite, nor am I sympathetic to any of those views. They are abhorrent and I reject them wholly and without reservation. People I am close to personally and professionally are Jewish, Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, straight, gay, black, white, Asian, and they have shaped my life and thinking over all these years. I grew up in Australia, but truthfully, I grew up on the Internet. I grew up without television or movies as cultural touchstones. I learned about the world, its inhabitants and ideas online. It’s where I learned my craft to program and code, and how to navigate the vast variety of information, thoughts and views. It had not always been a straight path, and it had not always served me well. There was a period when I explored a range of ideas—not out of belief in any of them, but out of a desire to search for self and place in the world. I have finally found it, and the mission to help make America a safer place. To those who have read my words in the Huffington Post article, I deeply apologize for them. I was shocked by and completely unaware of Marko Jukic’s online writings under a different name. As soon as those writings were brought to my attention, we took steps to separate him from the company. Tyler Bass no longer works as a consultant for Clearview AI.

This included Mike Cernovich, who is known for the infamous Pizzagate campaign and Andrew Auerheimger, a Nazi hacker who is involved with the far-right neo-Nazi, white supremacist and Holocaust denial site, The Daily Storm, according to the report.

The Huffington Post claims to have evidence that Ton-That attended a dinner with white supremacist Richard Spencer that was organized by alt-right financier Giesea, an associate of Thiel.

And was also a guest at the 'Night for Freedom' party organized in New York two years later, which was also attended by Gavin Mcinnes, the Canadian founder of the neo-fascist Proud Boys gang.

The Pizzagate campaign leader Jack Posobiec was also present along with Canadian cult leader Stefan Molyneux and James O'Keefe, who in 2009 released a movie that ridiculed people of color that was financed by Thiel, claims the report.

According to documents obtained by the Huffington Post, Thiel is suggested to have given Johnson funding for a startup that the Southern Poverty Law Center would label a 'white nationalist hate group.'

However, the characters do not appear on any of the incorporation papers and the only link between Johnson and Ton-That is a single Facebook post.

Sources associated with the far-right did tell the Huffington Post that the two were in close contact since early 2016 when Johnson told them he was working with Ton-That on a facial recognition system.

Johnson told one source later that year that he viewed the technology as a way to potentially 'identify every illegal alien in the country.'

There is also a Facebook post that he shared saying he was 'building algorithms to ID all the illegal immigrants for the deportation squads.'

Video and private messages obtained by the Huffington Post confirm that Johnson and Ton-That teamed up on 'far-right schemes' in 2016.

And a year later they were in talks about scraping social media sites for a facial recognition business.

Then there is Marko Jukic, a Clearview employee who has contributed to extremist blogs with anti-semantic comments.

Text in emails show a thread between Johnson and his associates at GotNews, which discussed a 'dogwhistle' post they were putting together about a racially motivated mass shooting in Fresno, California, that was carried out by Black man who was Muslim.

Tyler Bass, a GotNews writer, questioned if there was a way to scrape 'an entire Facebook page quickly ... the next time another American goes apes*** and before Facebook pulls it down out of shame.'

'I was shocked by and completely unaware of Marko Jukic's online writings under a different name,' Ton-That shared with DailyMail.com.

277,"Major Strikes Against the Shadow Government Happening Now

We’ve been promised that there are white hats taking down the cabal – the shadow government that even six former presidents have referenced – but is it really true? Here are some of the pieces of the puzzle which suggest that the shadow government is actually failing against their opponents:

The 3rd Vault 7 Wikileaks release suggests that the white hats just completed a major chess move against the deep state. In essence, the Vault 7 release reveals that the CIA has anti-forensic programs in place (to cover their rear-ends). These are 676 source code files for the CIA’s secret anti-forensic Marble Framework. Marble is used to hamper forensic investigators and anti-virus companies from attributing viruses, trojans and hacking attacks to the CIA, but more importantly, it shows that they can cover up their own computer hacking into intelligence “dumps” such as suggesting Russia is responsible for everything happening in the U.S.

The Feds Are About to Be Audited

Just a few days ago Jason Chaffetz shocked everyone by saying that the House Panel on Government Reform was going to Audit the Federal Reserve. The House panel has approved legislation that will allow a government watchdog audit the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions, a move bitterly opposed by the central bank. The move was passed after only about 30 minutes of debate. They had their minds made up it was time to sink these fools.

Other bills have been submitted before to audit the Fed that were shot down, but President Trump has expressed interest in carrying this one through. Let’s hope he actually supports this one to the bitter end. The Fed’s total abolishment would start with an audit, which would then give us ample proof of reason to shut them down for good.

The Truth About Vaccines is Likely Around the Corner

Del Bigtree the producer of the movie Vaxxed, says CDC Whistleblower Dr. William Thompson and his claims are being investigated. When he asked the oversight committee charged with investigating Dr. William Thompson’s claims that MMR vaccines were causing autism in the past he was met with blank stares. He is now reporting that every politician he speaks to knows exactly who Thompson is, and that his claims are being investigated.

The Syrian War Policy Has Been Changed

Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) called out our government a few weeks back and asked them to stop funding terrorists, after travelling to Syria for herself on a secret trip to see exactly what was going on. The U.S. also admitted that the ISIS headquarters they just blew up was an innocent family’s home, and Assange says the CIA created ISIS. Maybe that’s why the Syrian war policy is suddenly abruptly changing.

Something is Brewing with Pizzagate

After doing an abrupt about-face on Pizzagate, Alex Jones issued a formal apology. This should clue us in that things are heating up. Big media players like Money magazine and NPR reported the heck out of this abrupt change in opinion, without explaining why Jones would be so brash as to talk up the pedophile problem and then act as if it suddenly didn’t exist.

This news is also timed just weeks after Trump signed the Presidential Executive Order on Enforcing Federal Law with Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations and Preventing International Trafficking.

Now John Podesta is seeking immunity if he is to testify about Hillary, and other pedophilia business, which he has been linked to. I’m not sure who is about to wail on all the big wigs. It could be Podesta, or someone else to save their own rear-ends, but someone’s about to give up the goose. This could spell the beginning of the end for international pedophilia rings in the U.S. and U.K.

Our times stay interesting, if nothing else. Let’s hope the white hats are winning, and with our help to pass the message, the cabal’s attempts to control information are at least stymied.

731,"A Florida woman pleaded guilty and was sent to prison Wednesday for threatening a man whose six-year-old son was killed in the 2012 mass shooting at a Connecticut school, which she contended was a hoax.

Senior U.S. District Judge James Cohn sentenced Lucy Richards, 57, to five months in prison, followed by five months of home detention. She pleaded guilty to interstate transmission of a threat to injure in communications with Lenny Pozner, the father of Noah Pozner, who died in the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Conn.

Cohn called Richards's actions toward Pozner ""disturbing"" and said no one should cite a conspiracy theory or belief in a hoax in the deaths of 20 children and six adults that occurred at the school.

""I'm sure he wishes this was false and he could embrace Noah, hear Noah's heartbeat and hear Noah say 'I love you, Dad,'"" Cohn told Richards. ""Your words were cruel and insensitive. This is reality and there is no fiction. There are no alternative facts.""

Investigators say Richards made four voicemail and email threats to Pozner on Jan. 10, 2016, after viewing internet sites claiming the shooting was a hoax aimed at curtailing Americans' Second Amendment gun ownership rights. The messages said things such as ""you gonna die, death is coming to you real soon"" and ""LOOK BEHIND YOU IT IS DEATH.""

Richards, seated in a wheelchair at the hearing, has significant mental health problems including agoraphobia — fear of leaving one's house — obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety disorder, court documents show. But Cohn said he did not think mental illness triggered her actions.

""You have the absolute right to think and believe as you so desire,"" the judge said. ""You do not have the right to transmit threats to another.""

In a statement before she was sentenced, Richards apologized and said she could not account for her actions against Pozner that day.

""I don't know where my heart and head were that day, but they were not in the right place,"" she said. ""It was the worst mistake of my life and I am truly sorry.""

Others linked to the Sandy Hook massacre have reported harassment by hoax believers amid a growing trend of ""fake news"" stories and baseless conspiracy theories, such as the ""Pizzagate"" case in which a man fired an assault-style rifle inside a Washington, D.C., pizzeria after going there to investigate unfounded claims it harboured a child sex abuse ring.

In fact, Richards' public defender Robert Berube said he had gotten calls from around the United States from people who think Sandy Hook was a hoax.

""There were many people who told me it never took place,"" he said.

In addition to the prison time and home arrest, Richards will serve three years on probation and is barred from accessing a list of conspiracy theory websites.

542,"CNN's Jake Tapper confronted Vice President-elect Mike Pence during a Tuesday interview, grilling the head of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team over whether he was aware that Michael Flynn's son — who is in hot water over spreading a conspiracy theory that led someone to bring a rifle into a Washington DC pizza shop — had a security clearance requested for him.

Tapper reported earlier Tuesday that a source familiar with the situation said Trump's transition team requested a security clearance for Michael Flynn Jr., and that Trump gave a direct order to remove him from transition effort.

A firestorm ensued Monday over Flynn Jr.'s promotion of the ""pizzagate"" conspiracy theory, which baselessly alleged through a conspiracy that a pedophilia ring involving high-level Democratic Party officials — including Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's campaign chair, John Podesta — was operating out of a Washington pizzeria called Comet Ping Pong.

On Sunday, police say, the conspiracy theory led an armed man to go to the pizzeria. The 28-year-old man carried an assault rifle to the restaurant and was looking to investigate the story himself, according to police.

""Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story,"" Flynn Jr. posted to Twitter. ""The left seems to forget #PodestaEmails and the many 'coincidences' tied to it.""

As of Monday, Flynn Jr. had a government transition email, CNN reported. Flynn himself also shared a similar conspiracy theory on Twitter days before the November election that claimed Clinton was involved in sex crimes with children. Politico on Tuesday found that the incoming national security adviser had shared dubious news stories at least 16 times from his Twitter account since August.

During his interview with Pence, Tapper asked the vice president-elect to tell him ""what happened"" regarding Flynn Jr., who was said to have ""no longer"" been involved in the Trump transition effort by transition spokesman Jason Miller during a Tuesday conference call. Pence said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" Tuesday that Flynn Jr. had ""no involvement in the transition team whatsoever"" as of that morning.

Pence insisted that Flynn's son was helping ""a bit"" with ""scheduling and administrative items"" but ""that's no longer the case.""

""Look, all — all of our families want to be helpful,"" Pence said, per a transcript. ""And four weeks to the day from Election Day there's been an awful lot of work to do. But — but — but Mike Flynn Jr. is no longer associated with Gen. Flynn's efforts or with the transition team.""

""You — you're downplaying his role, but you must be aware that the transition team put in for a security clearance for Michael G. Flynn, the son of Lt. Gen. Flynn,"" Tapper responded.

""Well, I'm — I'm aware in talking to Gen. Flynn that — that his son was helping with scheduling,"" Pence said back. ""Jake, his — his.""

""No, but you put in for a security clearance for him,"" he said.

""He's helping his dad arrange for meetings and provide meetings,"" Pence retorted. ""But that's no longer the case.""

Tapper fired back, asking if you need a security clearance to ""do scheduling?""

""I think that's the appropriate decision for us to move forward, avoid any further distraction,"" Pence replied, then reiterating his confidence in Trump.

""I want to move on to other issues, but I'm afraid I just didn't get an answer, which is were you aware that the transition had put in for a security clearance for Michael Flynn Jr.?"" Tapper persisted.

""You know, I've worked very closely with Gen. Flynn,"" Pence said. ""We've met on many occasions. I've — I've never — I've never seen his son present for any of those meetings.""

""But you're head of the transition team so you know who you put in security clearances for,"" Tapper pressed on.

""Well — well, Gen. — Gen. Flynn did inform me that his son was helping on administrative matters,"" the Indiana Republican said. ""But — but, Jake, this is all the kind of distraction that — that, frankly, I know, with all due respect, the national media likes to go chasing after.""

Tapper pushed forward with the line of questioning an additional time.

""The last question on this sir — and I'm sorry, it's just that you're not answering the question, which is were you aware that the transition team had put in for a security clearance?"" Tapper asked. ""I mean this is a young man who had a social media profile that had all sorts of crazy conspiracy theories ... all sorts of links and retweets with white supremacists. Were you aware that the transition put in for a security clearance for him?""

""Well, what I can tell you is that in — in talking with Gen. Flynn today, he made me aware that his son was assisting him in scheduling ..."" Pence answered.

""And then you put in for a security clearance,"" Tapper interjected.

Pence then launched into an extended answer:

"" ... meetings and well whatever the appropriate paperwork was to assist him in that regard. Jake, I'm sure ... was taking place. But that's no longer the case. And your viewers and the American people can be confident that we're going to — we're going to continue to drive forward.

Look, this is a very challenging time for America's place in the world. It was a week ago yesterday that we saw a terrorist-inspired attack on the Ohio State campus. We're bringing together with — with Gen. Flynn, with KT McFarland, with a team that's going to surround them and advise this president, people that are going to, going to set into motion. I'm confident, [in] the policies that will — that will make America safe again at home and abroad.""

""And it was just two days ago that we saw somebody with a gun go to Comet Pizza because of this crazy conspiracy theory that Michael G. Flynn had been putting out there, defended afterwards, and you guys put in for a security clearance,"" Tapper responded.

Watch part of the interview below:

Tapper confronted Flynn Jr. on Twitter Sunday following the armed man entering the pizzeria and Flynn Jr.'s subsequent defense of the conspiracy. He apparently direct-messaged Flynn Jr. on the app, asking for one piece of evidence proving that the pizza shop was ""the site of a satanic pedophilia cult."" Those direct messages were posted by another user.

259,"As the internet spread, the regimes in Moscow and Beijing concluded that simply blocking the web would be unworkable, but they were unwilling to surrender their existing control over speech. China’s answer was flooding the zone: paying people to create content that supported the government and effectively drowned out any critics. It was soft censorship, less politically toxic and resource intensive than locking up any dissenter. Russia adopted a more bellicose stance, raising armies of trolls who would harass, defame, and humiliate Vladimir Putin’s critics, whether at home or abroad.

The tactics themselves were not always new. Russian attempts to defame opponents echoed World War I British “atrocity propaganda,” which attacked Germans with a mix of partially true and fabricated claims of deviance. Russia simply adapted that to the internet age.

It’s not hard to pick out how these tactics have spread to the United States. Trolling has been imported, both by Americans mirroring Russian tactics, and also by the very same Russian trolls—as alleged by Special Counsel Robert Mueller in his indictment of the “troll farm” Internet Research Agency and some of its employees and officers. There’s plenty of flooding the zone, too, from President Trump’s attention-sucking Twitter feed to the burgeoning market in fake news. The “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory emerged from the atrocity-propaganda tradition, and required internet trolls to spread. It combined a real restaurant with fake claims to slur Hillary Clinton and her aides.

“Somehow, most of them seem ridiculous, but over time these things have had a unfortunate tendency to stick,” Wu said.

The idea that the First Amendment should, and even can, adapt to a new moment like this is jarring—it feels like an everlasting edict. But as Wu pointed out, what Americans think of as the First Amendment tradition dates only to the mid-20th century. Seven years after the ratification of the Bill of Rights, the government jailed a U.S. congressman under the Sedition Act because he had accused President John Adams of an “unbounded thirst for ridiculous pomp, foolish adulation, and selfish avarice.”

Almost exactly 100 years ago, Eugene Debs gave a speech in Canton, Ohio, criticizing American engagement in World War I and the draft. He was charged, convicted, and sentenced to 10 years in prison, with the punishment upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court. As late as the 1930s and ’40s, people were imprisoned for advocating communism. It was only after World War II that the current free-speech doctrines came into play.

That is both frightening and heartening. On the one hand, the shallow roots of today’s traditions show how easily the recent gains could be erased. Yet it also shows the First Amendment tradition can be flexible and adaptable to new moments. If Wu’s diagnoses are intriguing, however, his prescriptions are less satisfying.",mainstream,M1c0c1,pizzagate
411,"Poverty, joblessness, and other societal problems may form the roots leading to a higher murder rate when African Americans are the victims, but too many guns are the fertilizer that makes that statistic grow.

A new report released in March shows African Americans make up only 13 percent of the nation’s population, but are half of its murder victims.

The annual Black Homicide Victimization in the United States study notes that the national black homicide victimization rate, 16.38 per 100,000, far exceeds the rate for whites who were murdered, which is 2.52 per 100,000. The analysis is based on unpublished data from the FBI Supplementary Homicide Report for 2014, the latest year for which data is available.

Pennsylvania had 387 murders that year, which produced the fifth highest black homicide victimization rate in the nation, 26.07 per 100,000. That’s one-and-a-half times the national black homicide victimization rate and six times the overall homicide rate nationwide, according to the Violence Policy Center’s analysis.

Missouri had the highest black murder rate, with 250 victims, or a rate of 34.98 per 100,000; followed by Indiana, 29.49; New Mexico, 28.48; and Nebraska, 28.17. New Jersey, with 217 black murder victims, had a rate of 16.43 per 100,000, ranking it 19th. Tiny Delaware had only 42 victims, but it ranked 14th in the country with a rate of 20.18 per 100,000.

The study found that of Pennsylvania’s 387 black homicide victims, 340 were male; the victims’ average age was 31 years old; 87 percent were killed with guns; and in instances where a relationship could be established, 87 percent were killed by someone they knew, typically as the result of an argument.

“Pennsylvania remains a dangerous place for African Americans, especially African American males,” said Shira Goodman, executive director of CeaseFirePA. “And while our legislature has the power to enact policies that could help reverse this trend, it not only fails to enact them, but also fails to give our cities the tools to better protect their own people.”

Making Goodman’s point is a renewed effort in the legislature to allow the weapons industry to sue Pennsylvania towns that try to enact tougher gun laws. “The gun lobby is obsessed with creating a special right for itself to sue our cities, punish elected officials for working hard to keep people safe, and divert tax dollars to frivolous litigation,” said Goodman.

Mayor Kenney, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, Lancaster Mayor Rick Gray, and Oxford Mayor Geoff Henry have signed a letter urging the Senate Local Government Committee to oppose the legislation.

The importance of better gun control is validated by the new statistics on black homicides, which show that in 83 percent of the cases where the weapon could be identified, the victim was shot; and in 73 percent of those cases a handgun was used. In 71 percent of the homicides, no other felony was committed, which weakens arguments that people need guns to fend off robbers.

The numbers show that most black homicide victims were shot by someone they knew after an argument. More police may prevent some of those murders, but not as much as by having fewer guns.

MONEY FROM THE STATE THAT SCHOOLS CAN’T USE, April 3

Gov. Tom Wolf has been beating the drum for more state funding for public education ever since the election campaign of 2014. And, no doubt, school districts would welcome additional revenue from Harrisburg, both to pay for critical classroom needs and to give some relief to weary property owners whose real estate taxes keep going up.

Unfortunately for the districts and their residents, more state money sent to the schools won’t be much help if it comes with the same strings that are attached to current school subsidies.

Last week, David Matyas, business manager for the Central Bucks School District, detailed what actually happens to millions of dollars Harrisburg sends to CB. As Matyas explained during a budget presentation to the school board, “Most of these subsidies are things we can’t spend money on. It comes into the left pocket and goes out of the right pocket. The governor gives and the governor takes away, as well.”

What happens is this: The state counts as revenue money earmarked for such things as the mandated payments to the school employee pension system, Social Security and property tax relief from gambling.

“They send us a check that we pass through, but they count it as revenue,” said board member Paul Faulkner, who described the process as “smoke and mirrors.”

Central Bucks estimates it will receive just under $68 million in so-called state revenue toward its 2017-18 budget of $332.2 million. But $24.8 million of that subsidy is a reimbursement for half of the district’s $49.6 million payment to PSERS, the Public School Employees’ Retirement System. Another $5.8 million of the state money goes to pay half of the district’s $11.6 million in Social Security taxes. And casino money that totals about $5 million merely offsets the same amount homeowners aren’t paying in property taxes.

All of that money — over half of what the state sends to Central Bucks — arrives already spoken for. “We can’t spend it; we can’t touch it; we can’t do anything with it,” said Faulkner. “It’s not our money. It’s frustrating.”

Faulkner went on to say that when state lawmakers “claim they have increased our revenue for the year, when they say they’ve increased our budget by X percentage, you need to get into the weeds to find out what that really means.”

What it means is nothing good for Central Bucks, nor for every other school district that supposedly receives state money that in reality it doesn’t get to spend on education or anything else. The problem of Pennsylvania’s underfunding its public schools apparently is even more serious than it appears at first glance.

Add this to the to-do list for the Legislature and the governor. Increasing state funding for the schools will be an empty gesture as long as the money is spent before it arrives.

In this age of astounding technological advances, people across the globe have access to more information than at any time in history. The question we all face, however, is whether it’s good information, or more examples of the “fake news” phenomena that dominates our culture today.

We saw it play out during last year’s election campaign, when outrageous claims took off on social media, sometimes to dangerous consequences. Many will remember the infamous “Pizzagate” story that claimed leaked emails showed members of the Democratic Party were behind a child pornography ring operating out of a Washington, D.C., pizza parlor.

The story had absolutely no basis in fact, yet it was picked up by several websites and spread through social media so extensively that the shop owner and his employees were besieged with threats. A man from North Carolina drove to the shop, supposedly to investigate the claims he had read, and fired a semi-automatic weapon into the building, leading to his arrest.

Fortunately, no one was physically injured as the result of that incident, but it showed the extent to which websites and social media outlets will spread a story with no investigation of the claims or any acknowledgement of a responsibility to the truth.

Newspapers and responsible news media outlets have been fighting this battle against fake news for decades. There have always been conspiracy theorists spouting allegations that have little basis in fact or reality, but today those claims can find a home — and a following — thanks to websites and social media.

What’s most disturbing is that some websites create fake news solely for profit. By using advanced software that manipulates the analytics attached to a story, the number of viewers can be made to look far greater than is actually the case. The more viewers, the more the story gets picked up by other social media, and more viewers means significant payment from some of the sites for corralling all those views.

A recent report on the CBS News show “60 Minutes” cited one former operator of an admitted fake news site who said that with totally fabricated stories, he could make as much as $10,000 a month, depending on how widely the stories were distributed and viewed.

And some politicians, even as high up as President Donald Trump, have taken advantage of the situation by claiming that stories they simply disagree with or don’t like are fake news. To be clear, that is simply not the case. Fake news is just as the name implies — fake, phony, a collection of lies or half-truths, often written with the intent of undermining the work of responsible news operations.

Today, March 29, the News Media Alliance and its partners are celebrating real news as the cure to fake news by making a commitment to news that is real, reputable and trusted.

David Chavern, CEO of the News Media Alliance, put it simply: “Making stuff up is easy. What is hard is checking facts and digging up stories that powerful people want to keep hidden.”

It’s become far too common to criticize and disparage the news media, from the national level down to local outlets. But in a time when fake news runs rampant, it’s important to trust and rely on the real media and the journalists who work hard to continue to do their jobs under increasingly difficult circumstance.

The Times news staff remains committed to responsible journalism built on the premise that facts matter and that we are obligated to provide readers with reliable, verifiable information. We stand ready to continue the fight against fake news sites and, on this day in particular, are proud to show our support for real news and real journalism.

The Pennsylvania Legislature is again endorsing a limited news blackout after police shootings or other actions that result in death or serious injury. HB 27, passed last month by the House of Representatives, would criminalize the release of the name of a police officer involved in such an incident for 30 days.

This is a bad law, even if it starts with the good intention to protecting officers from retaliation or harassment. In the wake of police shootings or other serious uses of force, the public is best served by having detailed information about what happened. In all but the most extenuating circumstances, that should include the identities of those involved.

HB 27 goes too far in promoting secrecy, especially when a community is expecting the knowable facts after a police shooting. Across the nation, many police departments are stepping up and expediting the release of information after potentially explosive situations.

Pennsylvania is going in the other direction. Right now it’s up police chiefs or district attorneys to decide when and how to release this information. In Philadelphia, a local law requires the identity of police officer involved in a shooting to be released within 72 hours of the incident.

In many communities, however, local discretion can be used to conceal a police officer’s identity — sometimes indefinitely — whether there is a security threat or not. That was the case in the shooting of Richard Scheuermann III by Easton police in October 2014. It wasn’t until the following March that authorities disclosed Easton Sgt. Dominick Marraccini had fired the fatal shot. Scheuermann crashed his truck after a high-speed police pursuit, and rammed a police car after he was hemmed in by police vehicles at 13th and Spring Garden streets.

Unless criminal charges are filed, HB 27 would prohibit the release of an officer’s identity for 30 days — earlier only if the officer authorizes it or the official investigation is finished before then. Anyone who violates the law would face a second-degree misdemeanor charge.

Last year the Legislature passed a similar bill and sent it to Gov. Tom Wolf, who vetoed it. This year the House and Senate, armed with larger Republican majorities, are promising to override a veto.

This shouldn’t be a partisan issue. In rejecting the bill, Wolf argued that an increasing incidence of police shootings and public mistrust of police power demand more openness, not less.

There may be times when police officers need protection from mob reaction or other fallout from a shooting. That’s a valid concern. We recognize and respect the difficult situations officers encounter in protecting the public.

But secrecy should not be the presumption of a law that seeks to balance police powers with the public’s right to know about the use of deadly force. It should be the other way around — police departments should be required to get court approval, during a brief cooling-off period, to withhold the identities of police officers who have a case for protection.

Municipal police chiefs, the state police and district attorneys should be encouraged to disclose who did what in a police shooting in a timely manner — without the harness of a month-long gag. Criminalizing the release of information that it is critical to public understanding in times of uncertainty or emergency is a bad precedent, to say the least.

Despite the implosion of the GOP’s half-baked American Health Care Act, and regardless of the latest firestorm over a tweet from President Trump, the administration did manage to move forward on a project stuck in the muck of liberal ideology for years: The Keystone XL oil pipeline.

The State Department’s recent approval of the Canada-to-Texas pipeline reverses nearly a decade of deliberate foot-dragging by the Obama administration, which ultimately rejected the project in 2015. And yet the reason for rejection — Keystone’s presumed climate-change detriments — was dismissed by President Obama’s own State Department, which back in 2013 found that any adverse effects from the pipeline would be minimal.

And whether this oil from Canadian tar sands is pumped through a U.S. pipeline or shipped off to China, it’s not going to stay in the ground.

Contrary to the foot-stomping hysterics from environmental elitists — who leave behind their own noxious emissions as they jet and motor from one cause to the next — America and the rest of the world run on oil, now and in the foreseeable future.

Moreover, incessant Keystone XL criticism is not credible when pipelines have a proven safety record and are considerably less risky than moving petroleum by rail through populated areas.

The 1,200-mile Keystone XL pipeline still has a long way to go through requisite state approvals and environmental groups’ lawsuits. But at least now it can advance after being idled at the federal level by ideological opposition.",mainstream,M09990,pizzagate
286,"Despite Washington Post admitting its “fake news” exposé was based on shoddy research

Facebook is already blocking links to so-called “fake news” stories, despite the Washington Post being forced to admit that its own definitive article on “fake news” was based on shoddy research.

A Twitter user revealed how he tried to post an Alex Jones Channel video about ‘PizzaGate’ on Facebook but was blocked from doing so because Facebook characterized the YouTube link as “unsafe”.

This suggests that more than just blocking alleged “fake news” websites, Facebook is censoring certain topics from being posted altogether.

The social network giant also appears keen to comply with a European Union demand that all “fake news,” which was listed on a par with hate speech and jihadist propaganda, be censored within 24 hours.

As we reported yesterday, after pressure from academics, Google is also de-listing information pertaining to criticism of Islam and information about black people being overrepesented in crime figures (which is an objective fact).

The notion of social media websites blocking content they arbitrarily decide to be “fake news” is chilling, especially given that the Washington Post has now been forced to admit that its vaunted “fake news” exposé was itself fake after massive blowback.

“A lengthy editor’s note appeared on top of the original article in which the editor not only distances the WaPo from the “experts” quoted in the original article whose “work” served as the basis for the entire article (and which became the most read WaPo story the day it was published) but also admits the Post could not “vouch for the validity of PropOrNot’s finding regarding any individual media outlet”, in effect admitting the entire story may have been, drumroll “fake news” and conceding the Bezos-owned publication may have engaged in defamation by smearing numerous websites – Zero Hedge included – with patently false and unsubstantiated allegations,” reports Zero Hedge.

Given that the first list of “fake news” websites was also completely debunked as the bias-driven musings of a far-left social justice warrior, what credibility does the mainstream media have left in lecturing everyone else as to what constitutes “fake news”?

NEW YORK (AP) — An old picture of Roseanne Barr dressed as Adolf Hitler, wearing a swastika and pulling burnt cookies from an oven, splashed on the front of the New York Daily News Wednesday like a neon sign asking ABC executives: What were you thinking?

Given Barr’s past incidents of bad behavior and questionable social media posts, ABC faced questions Wednesday about why it went back into business with her before it all blew apart. ABC canceled its successful reboot of “Roseanne” on Tuesday following the star’s racist tweet likening former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to a cross between the Muslim Brotherhood and a “Planet of the Apes” actor.

Barr continued tweeting on Wednesday, at one point saying the offending tweet was composed at 2 a.m. after she took the insomnia drug Ambien. That led the drug maker Sanofi to say on social media that “racism is not a known side effect” of their product.

President Donald Trump, noting in a tweet that Robert Iger, CEO of ABC’s parent Walt Disney Co., had called Jarrett to apologize, wondered why ABC hadn’t apologized for “HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC.”

On social media, Barr wrote that what she said was indefensible, then retweeted several statements others made supporting her. She apologized to those who had lost their jobs because of her action, but also condemned cast members who threw her under the bus, in her words.

“I’m not a racist, I never was & I never will be,” she wrote Wednesday. “One stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights 4 all minorities, against networks, studios, at the expense of my nervous system/family/wealth will NEVER be taken from me.”

Yet many saw a disturbing pattern being followed instead of a joke. Questionable actions date back to a cringe-worthy, crotch-grabbing rendition of the national anthem in 1990; a claim, later recanted, that she was an incest survivor; and the 2009 picture reprinted on the Daily News. Her social media past includes a racist tweet about former national security adviser Susan Rice and support for conspiracy theories like “pizzagate.” On the same night as her Jarrett tweet, she posted a false claim about Chelsea Clinton that Clinton refuted.

ABC executives were not discussing their thought processes on Wednesday. It’s clear, though, that Barr’s social media habits were a sore point. She told USA Today earlier this year that “I had to get off social media because everybody’s mad at me.” In an Adweek article published only 10 days ago, she promised only to talk about what she’s for, and not what she’s against, when tweeting.

“Roseanne has said herself that she does not want what she says to overshadow the show in any way, and I do hope that she will continue to be thoughtful about what she shares on social media going forward,” ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey said in the same article.

Was ABC’s gamble worth the risk to its reputation?

Opinion writer Roxane Gay wrote in The New York Times Wednesday that ABC did the right in canceling “Roseanne.” ″But before it did the right thing, it did the wrong thing,” she wrote.

“Everyone involved made a decision to support the show despite its co-creator’s racism,” Gay wrote. “They decided that their career ambitions, or desire to return to network television, or financial interests would best be served by looking the other way. It was only when Ms. Barr became an immediate liability that everyone involved finally looked at her racism and dealt with it directly.”

ABC executives talked shortly after the 2016 election about a need to have more on the network schedule to reflect the point of view that got Trump elected. When Sara Gilbert began rounding up the old “Roseanne” cast for a reunion in early 2017, ABC fought Netflix for the rights to show it. The network — indeed all of broadcast television — needed some successful comedies.

The rebooted “Roseanne,” where Barr played a Trump supporter, worked beyond anyone’s dreams — logging 25 million viewers for its premiere in March and settling in as television’s second most popular comedy after “The Big Bang Theory.”

“I tend to be pretty forgiving to people who feel they can get a good show out there and keep the star in check, and you usually can, because a lot of stars can be problematic,” said Garth Ancier, a veteran television executive who ran entertainment programming at Fox, NBC and the WB networks.

“I think it was a reasonable bet to take, and it worked until it didn’t,” Ancier said.

Ted Harbert knows better than most what Dungey and her boss, Ben Sherwood, went through. He was ABC’s top programming executive during the first run of “Roseanne” in the 1990s. Barr was his headache then; he recalled having to go to her home where she was holed up with Tom Arnold for a few weeks and refusing to work in 1994, and coax her out.

“This is a person who, left to her own devices, is not totally in control,” Harbert said. She has the temperament, and the tendency to go to dark places, that fuels many artists, he said.

Social media complicates the efforts of networks to keep stars working and things running smoothly, he said.

“How do you stop someone who does something like this in the middle of the night?” he said. “She blows up her own life and that of all those around her.”

If he were in Dungey’s position when the rebooted “Roseanne” was being considered — mindful that his job is to produce hits, or it won’t be his job much longer — Harbert said he probably would have taken several meetings with Barr to figure out how she was doing. He probably would have made the same decision ABC made, he said.

Both former executives praised ABC for moving swiftly when presented with Barr’s tweet. Ancier said ABC probably had a plan in place for that eventuality, given how quickly the show was erased from network web sites.

“A lot of comics say terrible things,” Harbert said. “As long as they make us laugh, it’s easy to forgive. What Roseanne said was not funny.”",mainstream,M1ee02,pizzagate
428,"The thought keeps suggesting itself (the “insane” thought par excellence ) that, perhaps, the bright reality of everyday life is but an illusion, to be swallowed up at any moment by the howling nightmares of the other, the night‐side of reality.

The term resistance in U.S. popular political discourse since the 2016 election has been associated primarily with left‐wing protest against President Donald Trump and his agenda. Among the most striking early examples of this were the Women’s March that followed Trump’s inauguration in January 2017, and the mass mobilizations at U.S. airports later that month to protest the new administration’s harsh restrictions on refugees and travelers from seven majority‐Muslim countries. The work in this special issue has mostly explored progressive resistance amid the broader reactionary political climate of recent years.

In this essay, I direct our attention to a different mode of resistance, in the form of populist dissent against expert knowledge and institutions. Rather than contesting public policy—for example, whether abortion should be legal, whether the United States should be involved in foreign wars, or the appropriate level of taxation—this mode of resistance contests the fundamental legitimacy of the expert knowledge claims that underpin much of common political discourse itself. What is specifically populist about this mode of resistance is that its adherents portray experts as not simply wrong or out of touch but as morally corrupt, or even predatory, as defined against the virtuous common sense of everyday people (Bonikowski and Gidron 2016; Brubaker 2017; Mudde 2004). Prominent within this resistance is conspiracy thinking: the notion that an elite cabal is secretly working to undermine the will and well‐being of the people. This conspiracy thinking primarily seeks to delegitimize institutions and experts, the political philosophers Russell Muirhead and Nancy Rosenblum (2019:3) argue, denying them their “standing in the political world to argue, explain, persuade, and decide.”

The belief in conspiracies as a driving force in history is broadly present in the U.S. population. A national survey in 2012 found that 30% of Americans agreed explicitly that “big events like wars, the current recession, and the outcomes of elections are controlled by small groups of people who are working in secret against the rest of us,” while another 38% neither agreed nor disagreed (Uscinski and Parent 2014). A 2013 survey found that 37% of Americans believed the Food and Drug Administration was deliberately withholding natural cures for cancer under pressure from profit‐seeking pharmaceutical companies; 20% believed physicians and government officials advocated vaccination even though they knew vaccines caused autism and other disorders; 12% believed the development of genetically modified crops was part of a secret plot by the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations to shrink the global population. These beliefs shaped behavior. Reported belief in more than one conspiracy theory was associated with resistance to routine medical interventions including flu vaccination, annual physical examinations, and dental visits (Oliver and Wood 2014). More generally, belief in conspiracy theories has been shown to decrease civic engagement and depress other pro‐social behavior (Jolley and Douglas 2014; Jolley et al. 2019; van der Linden 2015).

How can we make sense of this phenomenon sociologically? The phrase conspiracy theorist is commonly deployed as a tool of dismissal and exclusion (Husting and Orr 2007), and much of the previous literature on this topic either focuses on psychological factors or the political determinants and consequences of conspiracism (DiGrazia 2017). Instead, in this theoretical essay I take conspiracy theorizing seriously as a form of cultural cognition. For analytical leverage and to move away from the pejorative term conspiracy theorizing , I develop the notion of a “populist risk imaginary” that positions elites and institutions—corrupt, predatory, and omnipotent—as the motive force behind risk and disaster in the modern world. I use the term populism in line with recent work framing populism as a style of mobilization and rhetoric rather than a specific ideology or political program (Brubaker 2017). Populism is a style of rhetoric, discourse, and thought that “mobilizes ordinarily marginalized social sectors into publicly visible and contentious political action, while articulating an anti‐elite, nationalistic rhetoric that valorizes ordinary people” (Jansen 2011:82). The populist risk imaginary is a mode of thought that defines itself against what can be called the “institutional risk imaginary,” which conceives of risk and disaster as public problems that can be detected, measured, and managed through expert systems, instruments, and organized social control.

The populist risk imaginary arises from what Karen Cerulo (2006) has called “negative asymmetric thinking,” described as an emancipating structure that allows actors to deviate from preconceptions that would blind them to the possibility of negative outcomes. Negative asymmetric thinkers foreground the worst‐case scenarios that without preemptive action might confront them in the future. Similarly, the populist risk imaginary promises emancipation through foregrounding the worst possible outcomes of and motives for institutional risk management.

Where the institutional risk imaginary perceives a rise in mass shootings and invites debate over the appropriate scope of Second Amendment rights to gun ownership, the populist risk imaginary frames mass shooting events themselves as hoaxes perpetrated by shadowy figures in the service of authoritarian ends. Similarly, debate over the correct policy responses to the threat of terrorism becomes in the populist risk imaginary a debate over whether events like the 9/11 attacks were “false flag operations” carried out or enabled by government elites specifically in order to justify intrusive security and surveillance measures. Scientific knowledge claims about global climate change are dismissed as not simply mistaken, but as maliciously fabricated by elite scientists conspiring in pursuit of a liberal agenda (Gauchat 2015). In the realm of public health, some strands of resistance against vaccination have in recent years taken on a similar populist aspect—a belief that medical experts, scientists, and regulators are conspiring with the pharmaceutical industry to push vaccines they know to be unsafe and ineffective in order to enrich themselves (Reich 2016).

That people believe duplicitous elites are conspiring to cause harm in the world is not itself new. In the 1960s, Richard Hofstadter demonstrated the persistence of what he called the “paranoid style” in American political culture, tracing a connection from seventeenth‐century fears about global freemasonry through to elaborate stories of communist infiltration in the middle of the twentieth century (Hofstadter 1996). At least two recent developments, however, are worth considering. The first is the consistent and successful use of rhetoric appealing to the populist risk imaginary by a major‐party presidential nominee, who continues to deploy it while in office. This comes against the background of the second development: the expanding role of institutional risk management in public life, which is to say, the growth of the institutional risk imaginary.

In the years leading up to his campaign for the presidency, Donald Trump routinely promoted or endorsed conspiracy theories: that President Barack Obama was secretly born outside the United States; that climate change was a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese government; that vaccination caused autism. A central theme in his campaign was that hidden global forces were conspiring to undermine American interests: that the Mexican government was intentionally sending criminals across the border into the United States, or that his opponent Hillary Clinton was working with—in his words—“a global financial elite to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty” (Hochschild 2016), or that unspecified enemies would carry out voter fraud to deprive him of victory in the election.

This departure from normally accepted political rhetoric was key to Trump’s political appeal (Wagner‐Pacifici and Tavory 2017). Embracing conspiracy theories that were outside the bounds of respectable politics was part and parcel with the Trump campaign’s resonance with disaffected voters as “a vacation from a politics of bureaucratic rules, forms, and policies that promised melioration but were often experienced as obstacles” (Wagner‐Pacifici and Tavory 2017:318). Indeed, on the eve of the 2016 election, Arlie Hochschild wrote that many of the Louisiana conservatives she came to the know in the process of researching her book Strangers in Their Own Land had been drawn to Trump exactly because of this style of rhetoric. They supported him “because of his penchant for conspiracies, not in spite of it” (Hochschild 2016).

The success of Trump’s populist attacks came amid a decades‐long erosion of public trust in institutions (Twenge, Campbell, and Carter 2014) and a sense among voters that public issues are unfolding in a space “beyond their reach” (Perrin and Vaisey 2008:782). At the same time, institutions and experts have assumed an ever‐expanding role in detailing the risks we face and intervening in everyday life to manage them. Public health experts monitor disease outbreaks and warn that we are unprepared for the “next pandemic” (Lakoff 2017); counterterrorism and security experts warn about the need for preparedness against the “next terrorist attack” (Aradau and van Munster 2012; Molotch 2012; Stampnitzky 2013); meteorologists issue increasingly long‐term and detailed forecasts of severe weather (Daipha 2015; Fine 2007) while climatologists describe the dangers of a climate destabilized by human carbon emissions (Dunlap and Brulle 2015). These are some facets of the reorganization of public life around risk consciousness described by Ulrich Beck and Anthony Giddens as the Risk Society (Beck 1992, 2009; Giddens 1990, 1991). Under the Risk Society, institutions have oriented their risk management strategies around anticipation and preemption, rather than insurance and recovery (Anderson 2010; Collier 2008). Faced with risks that are uninsurable, governments and corporations increasingly look to mitigate future dangers through anticipatory governance in an “effort to transform encounters with risk into routine, formalizable processes—literally to organize uncertainty” (Power 2005:147).

It should perhaps be no surprise that these two attitudes toward risk—the elite belief that future disasters can in a meaningful way be controlled and the populist belief that elites control disastrous events—sometimes collide head‐on. That is to say, in a cultural milieu in which risk and disaster are perceived as increasing alongside the broadening scope of institutional risk management, some people draw the conclusion that these institutions are intentionally creating danger rather than preventing or ameliorating it.

For example, when in 2017 the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced it would conduct an exercise simulating the government’s response to a small‐scale nuclear attack on the New York City area, the popular conspiracy site InfoWars, whose publisher Alex Jones has been praised by Trump, posted an item speculating that the exercise could be cover for a real nuclear attack on the country, perpetrated by the government as an excuse to implement martial law.2 The story extended a long‐running and highly elaborated set of narratives that have been broadly held among right‐wing fringe groups since the early 1980s. In these narratives, FEMA’s disaster preparedness activities are reimagined as methodical preparations for an authoritarian takeover of the country from within (Barkun 2006; Keller 2010).

The case of the Holy Fire, a wildfire that burned more than 23,000 acres in Southern California in August and September 2018, provides a more acute example. In the period leading up to the fire, California had faced two consecutive years of record‐setting wildfire damage, provoking a sustained response from the state, and claims from the scientific community that global warming was a contributing factor. Meanwhile, stories circulating online claimed to unmask a conspiracy by the government to deliberately set the wildfires as a pretext for enacting land use reforms under the authoritarian influence of the United Nations (UN). This theory built on a broader family of narratives centered on the idea that the UN’s Agenda 21 sustainable development program is in fact a sinister plot to undermine U.S. sovereignty through local and regional land use planning measures. This idea has been adopted by conservative activists, who have mobilized around it to derail local sustainable development projects across the country (Norton 2014; Trapenberg Frick, Weinzimmer, and Waddell 2015). The idea that the state was intentionally setting wildfires was explicitly referenced on social media by the California man who, authorities allege, set the Holy Fire himself. The alleged arsonist, shortly before the fire started, contacted the chief of the local volunteer fire department, sending him a text message reading, “it’s all going to burn like you planned” (Cosgrove, Reyes‐Velarde, and Tchekmedyian 2018; Dalrymple 2018).

These two examples are indicative of a symbolic universe in which institutions that claim to be acting in the public interest to manage risk are instead understood as the primary sources of risk in society. In the remainder of this essay, I will argue that this populist risk imaginary emerges as a form of negative asymmetric thinking that sets itself in opposition to the professional fields of institutional risk management. Just as bureaucracy has both a “bright side” that brings benefits and a “dark side” that leads to unintended harms (Vaughan 1999), negative asymmetric thinking has a dark side, in this case unified around the idea that the greatest dangers we face come from the institutions that claim to be keeping us safe. By understanding conspiracist belief as populist risk cognition emerging from negative asymmetric thinking, we can better see the holders of these beliefs as knowledgeable actors in the social construction of reality rather than as political dupes who are simple victims of misinformation. Prior research has shown how fringe ideas move toward mainstream acceptance through appeals to fear and anger (Bail 2012, 2014). But we have more to learn about how that fear is structured, and why these appeals resonate with some people more than others. The concept of the populist risk imaginary suggests a way forward in that regard.",mainstream,M16514,pizzagate
168,"CNN contributor April Ryan is being criticized for alerting her 336,000 Twitter followers to a story in The Root that asks if the Trump administration is involved in child sex-trafficking.

Among those condemning Ryan for the tweet is first lady Melania Trump’s spokeswoman.

“If you’re a journalist w many followers & a @CNNPolitics contributor...is it ok to retweet any headline you want, regardless of if it’s true?” Stephanie Grisham asked on Twitter. “Remember: 'The core purpose of a journalist is to research, document, write, & present the news in an honest, ethical, & unbiased way.'”

CNN'S APRIL RYAN MISQUOTES SARAH SANDERS TO IMPLY SHE WANTED PHYSICAL FIGHT: 'IT WAS STREET'

Grisham may have been most disturbed by the headline of The Root article: “Is the Trump administration running a child-trafficking ring or nah? Follow me down the rabbit hole.”

Ryan responded later Sunday in a tweet: “So apparently fox just wants to slam me for clicks. and never read the article I retweeted either. Lol! So sad! Hello it said the conspiracies were unfounded. You just need me to hate. Thank you!!”

She also tweeted a link to her book.

Ryan, who is also the White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks, initially tweeted the article without comment. The Root is an online magazine of African-American culture.

So why should “alt-righters” have all the fun peddling disproven and unfounded conspiracy theories, writes The Root political editor Jason Johnson, who goes on to suggest one of his own.

“Now it turns out that the Trump administration may have an equally implausible conspiracy on its hands: Is the administration involved in child sex trafficking or just white nationalism? Follow me down the rabbit hole and see for yourself,” Johnson says in the article, published Friday.

Many of those who bashed Ryan on Twitter questioned how a professional journalist could associate herself with such a story.

“April Ryan has gone pizzagate on Trump,” tweeted Steve Robinson, who produces the Howie Carr radio talk show.

CNN'S APRIL RYAN HIT FOR SAYING MELANIA TRUMP IS 'NOT CULTURALLY AMERICAN'

“This is a horrid excuse for journalism,” Carmine Sabia tweeted. “To quasi accuse the president of the United States of running a child trafficking ring is low even for her.”

“Case solved,” Michael Sheridan tweeted. He pointed out that The Root is owned by Univision, whose president and CEO criticized Trump during the presidential campaign.",mainstream,M07b59,pizzagate
1272,"Donald Trump is set to welcome a series of far-right online figures to the White House for a social media summit in which none of the major tech companies have received an invite.

Among the guests invited was an artist who once published an antisemitic George Soros cartoon and conservative activist accused of trying to trick a major US newspaper into publishing a fake news story.

It comes just a week after Mr Trump hosted a meeting in the Oval Office with two Trump-supporting meme makers whose content has been promoted by both the US president and his allies.

The summit on Thursday, which will also attract Republican lawmakers and strategists, is likely to act as a stage for Mr Trump to further promote an unfounded conspiracy theory that social media companies are suppressing conservative voices.

It follows months of attacks on Twitter and Facebook by Mr Trump, who has suggested the companies may be acting illegally and should be sued by US regulators.

Conservative organisations expected to participate in the White House meeting include Turning Point USA, PragerU - short for Prager University - which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics or economics, and the right-wing Washington think tank Heritage Foundation.

But it was also initially set to include Ben Garrison, a cartoonist who in 2017 published an image depicting former US national security officials as puppets controlled by Jewish philanthropist Mr Soros, who in turn is puppeteered by an arm with “Rothschilds” written across the sleeve.

Politico reported the White House rescinded the invitation late on Tuesday night after it was asked questions about the cartoon.

The image was condemned as “blatantly antisemitic” by the Anti-Defamation League, which said said it had been commissioned by Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich.

Another attendee, James O’Keefe, runs an organisation called Project Veritas which attempts to damage figures and institutions it perceives to be anti-conservative.

It infamously attempted last year to deceive Washington Post reporters into publishing false allegations that a woman had been impregnated by Republican politician Roy Moore, in an apparent effort to discredit the newspaper’s coverage of him.

According to NBC News, they will also be joined by GOP activist Ali Alexander, whose fake Kamala Harris birther conspiracy was promoted by Donald Trump Jr, and QAnon conspiracy theorist Bill Mitchell.

White House spokesman Judd Deere said the White House conference on Thursday would bring together ""digital leaders for a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today's online environment"".

Two right-wing meme creators, who use the handles @mad_liberals and @CarpeDonktum, have already attended a 20-minute meeting with the president in the White House. Both said they had received invitations to Thursday’s summit.

During the 3 July meeting, Mr Trump asked of @CarpeDonktum, “Where is the genius? I want to meet the genius”, as he walked into the Oval Office, according to @mad_liberals. Both spoke to the Washington Post on condition their real names were excluded.

@CarpeDonktum has been behind a handful of comedically doctored videos which were subsequently tweeted by Mr Trump, including one in which former vice-president Joe Biden sneaks up on himself during a video in which he addresses sexual misconduct allegations.

@CarpeDonktum has complained of social media bias after Twitter temporarily banned his account for posting a video depicting Mr Trump repeatedly slapping CNN reporter Jim Acosta in the face.

Mr Trump and some supporters have long accused Silicon Valley companies of being biased against them. Accusations commonly levelled against the platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against those opposed to abortion and censorship of conservative political views. While some company executives may lean liberal, they have long asserted their products are without political bias.

Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment specifically on Thursday's meeting. But the Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said the internet ""offers the most open and accessible form of communication available today.""

Its members' platforms ""don't have a political ideology or political bias"", the group's president Michael Beckerman said in a statement. He added the companies ""succeed and grow by building a broad user base regardless of party affiliation or political perspectives"".

Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough, in a statement, said: ""We enforce the Twitter rules impartially for all users, regardless of their background or political affiliation. We are constantly working to improve our systems and will continue to be transparent in our efforts.""

The White House conference offers Mr Trump a chance to play to his conservative base in the lead-up to the 2020 election.

Mr Trump has played to conservative concerns about bias on other issues. In March, he signed an executive order requiring US colleges to protect free speech on their campuses or risk losing federal research funding.

The order cheered those who said universities were attempting to silence some conservative students and speakers. But critics called the order unnecessary.

The president himself was dealt a setback on Tuesday in his legal battle against Twitter, his favoured means of communicating. A federal appeals court in New York City ruled the president cannot ban critics from his Twitter account, saying the First Amendment calls for more speech, rather than less, on matters of public concern.

Mr Trump has an estimated 61 million followers on Twitter. He has accused Twitter of making it ""very hard for people to join me"" and ""very much harder for me to get out the message"".

Thursday's conference raised questions about whether Mr Trump would use the forum to signal tough actions ahead by his administration against the big companies in the areas of competition and privacy.

Big tech companies already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Mr Trump's 2016 campaign.

A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress. Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. The House Judiciary Committee has opened a bipartisan probe of the tech giants' market dominance.

A growing number of lawmakers and some Democratic presidential candidates are talking about tighter regulation of a customarily freewheeling industry or even breaking up the big companies.

But if Mr Trump is looking for the participating conservative groups to support government action to bring the companies in line on perceived social media bias, he may be disappointed.

Rob Bluey, vice president for communications at the Heritage Foundation, said that ""if the government were to get involved, it would lead to more problems"". He said market pressures can produce positive changes.

Turning Point USA keeps a list of college professors who it says discriminate against students with conservative views.

""I think there will be some form of equilibrium"" between the social media platforms and Americans who hold right-of-centre views, Charlie Kirk, the group's executive director, said on Tuesday. ""Hopefully these companies can self-correct.""

""Voters will be constructing their choices for 2020"" based largely on information from social media, Mr Kirk added.

Mr Trump said last week on Fox News that Google, Facebook and Twitter ""are fighting me hard right now, which is incredible because I think the Democrats want to shut them up and, frankly, so do a lot of the Republicans want to shut them up"".

Asked whether tech companies may be acting illegally and whether the Justice Department should determine that, Mr Trump replied, ""Well, they could be and I don't want to even say whether or not they're doing something, but I will tell you, there are a lot of people that want us ... to take action against Facebook and against Twitter and, frankly, against Amazon.""

Mr Trump told Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo last month he did not know if tech comapanies were doing anything illegal, but added, ""I tell you what, they should be sued because of what's happening with the bias"".",mainstream,M152a2,pizzagate

• On October 26th 2016, I had submitted an application to work as a Technical Sourcer and Recruiter at Oculus VR (a subsidiary of Facebook at the time, now Facebook Virtual and Augmented Reality Labs). My wife’s parents had sold their house on October 26th 2016, the same day I was hacked by Facebook and Facebook had figured out that my wife, Isabella Lasheras, was beautiful and could be “useful” as a sex slave. Mae and Edilberto Santiago divorced on the same day, informally, starting their divorce proceedings as Mae married into the Kahle family (an extensive family with its background in the formation of the early Internet and extensive government contracting and subcontracting), a direct satellite family to the Luckey family which is directly one degree of separation away from the Zuckerberg family. Since October 26th 2016, the Zuckerbergs, Luckeys, Kahles, Thiels and associated satellite families have been conspiring and actively trying to murder, sex traffick, human traffick and commit a heinous litany of crimes trying to suppress my investigation into the conspiracy, ever since I became a volunteer special agent and federal informant on November 2nd 2016.
• I was hacked by the corporation Facebook in October of 2016 after applying to work as a Technical Sourcer / Technical Recruiter at their Menlo Park Campus. I found the subsidiary president’s (Palmer Luckey) father’s number on com, a public repository for phone numbers. I spoke with him kindly and respectfully, asking if someone at Oculus could review my resume.
• I was then in the following week, wiretapped, hacked and had my GPS coordinates tracked by Facebook. I saw John Carmack and Mark Zuckerberg in Newark New Jersey in Blue Ford F150 trucks, which were presumably rented.
• Over the course of the next few months, my phone slowly started degrading and was rendered completely inoperable due to the malicious code that was injected on the phone. Facebook caused a material loss of $150-200 (the lowest minimum cost for a used phone of the same model type, Samsung Galaxy S4) to my father and I.
• I was under the suspicion that my wife Isabella Santiago, whom I asked to move here, and suddenly stopped talking to me the week I submitted an application, was sex trafficked or bribed by Facebook to stop talking to me, based on her sexual and aesthetic appeal.
• I have submitted numerous reports to law enforcement agencies including the local police department (Elizabeth PD), the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Secret Service, the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the President of the United States as well as the governor of California.
• I also have corroborating evidence in the form of a verbal confession that was given to a Mr.Jonas Kron, a senior Vice President at Trillium Asset Management. Here is Mr.Kron’s phone number :
• It was a six minute and forty second conversation where he had the phone presumably in his pocket.

Over the course of the last three years, I have gathered 500 gigabytes of publicly available evidence and testimony from many witnesses who have seen Isabella’s own whereabouts, including her parents. I have had three phones hacked, my computers wiretapped, my WLAN (wireless local area network hacked). I have tried contacting law enforcement and the only agency that would listen to me to file a report was the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This is the only agency with any real capacity to investigate federally. The local police departments keep throwing me into the psychiatric ward and are now on the precipice of pressing false charges against me for being a terrorist.

I have been suppressed on Twitter, Facebook, Twitch, Youtube and every social media platform. The corrupt actors at Facebook, Palantir, Oculus, CENSORED CENSORED (I cannot talk about these people via a court injunction) have been trying to contact every employer I seek employment with, every venture capitalist I seek venture capital from, every law enforcement agency I seek justice from and as either: Bribed, corrupted, threatened with money and extrajudicial justice (vigilante injustice) to silence them.

I will not remain silenced and I will speak truth to power, no matter how much I am tortured, how much I am raped, abused, no matter how much they sedate me in the psychiatric ward, I will always speak the truth concerning what is happening to me and whenever someone asks me what the truth really is concerning what happened to me.

Nineteen witnesses and myself included saw Jesus Christ materialize in the flesh.

That document is available. In that document I had proven I had telepathy numerous times (in particular my sexual telepathy) wherein I stated:
• I had conducted an experiment with my girlfriend/wife Isabella Santiago Lasheras where I had asked her to masturbate to me over the course of a week where she would not tell me when she was doing it and I would respond texting back when I felt the sensations, and the feelings were proven one to one causally related to being the sensations of another having sex, even 600 miles away, instantaneously so.
• I have reached out to every research institution in the United States which can be substantiated to long call record history and mass Twitter campaign of tweets I sent out trying to get a research institution to test me on favorable and amenable terms in regards to my natural human rights.
• An investigation into what may have been happening in my neighborhood around me has revealed that the United States Drug Enforcement Agency had conducted a raid of the house across from mine with ten undercover detective LEO vehicles along with a DEA van/truck at 6:00 AM On October 15th 2019. (The raid began earlier, but I had awoken in simultaneity, unconsciously, out of bed to the fact that there was a significant event occurring outside worthy of peeking through the blinds, without advanced foresight or warning in terms of a notice via any form of substantiave communication via text message, phone call, email, verbal conversation, etc.) Depicted herewithin are the images from the DEA raid which I had no prior forewarning of, that I had awoken to in simultaneity as a function of telepathic ‘cluing in’.
• I have no formal knowledge of whether or not this DEA Raid was a function of an investigation into a possible assassination attempt on my life, where Facebook may have placed assassins across the street from me (street criminals whom we had never seen living in that house, ever). Multiple witnesses in terms of long term residents of this area (I have been here for seven years, I have never seen the people who consistently wait outside of this house and are constantly in and out, presumably selling illicit narcotics, via logical deduction of the images listed herewithin. I testify to this as being the whole truth and nothing but the truth, in terms of the literal statements made herewithin concerning this particular investigation of these ‘neighbors’ whom no one had seen before, who had moved in recently across the street.)

I open the floor to you for questions and a brief discussion.

I am sincerely grateful for you allowing me to have the platform to plead my case before the people of the world, where I had been so suppressed by the media, conspiracy shows, social media platforms and other outlets to express my trepidation and immense pain I have been through.

I feel like I will be vindicated and justified for the pain I have been through.

1115,"For a large part of 2016, there's been a ton of discussion about fake news: How it spreads online, why it spreads in the first place, and who is involved in reading, believing, and spreading false stories.

It's a complicated issue with many angles. Fake news spreads because sometimes, people believe what they want to believe. It spreads because some people want to make money from it. It spreads because of political agendas.

It spreads because truth, and what's now called ""post-truth"" have an enormous arena in which to compete:

And the very mechanics of the complex systems of the internet are a big part of how and why fake news spreads.

Jonathan Albright is a professor at Elon University in North Carolina.

He researches social news, and, more recently, online propaganda. To study the way these so-called ""fake news"" stories spread, Jonathan looked at hundreds of stories that were tagged by academics as ""inaccurate"" or ""propaganda."" He came up with the term ""micropropoganda"" to describe what most people have called ""fake news.""

A lot of the finger-pointing has been at Facebook. The argument is that the Facebook algorithm favours and promotes stories that have lots of likes, shares, and so on. So you have a false story like the so-called Pizzagate story (about an underground pedophile ring in the basement of a pizzeria in Washington). If there's enough engagement with it, it shows up more. If it shows up more, more people see it and share it. And the ""truth"" of the story matters less and less.

But according to Jonathan, it isn't just Facebook that's the problem. It isn't even social media.

He found that a lot of inaccurate stories and sites promoting fake news were being shared the old fashioned way. ""Search engine referrals were just strangely high. And also direct referrals, which tells me maybe things are being transmitted by text messaging and even email and email newsletters. You know you can see these types of patterns,"" he explains. So he made a visualization of what he found, which you can see above.

There are all these multi-coloured circles of different sizes, connected by a web of lines. Each circle represents a website. And the lines show a network of fake news, anti-science, hoax, and misinformation.

When you look at the image, what you notice is that the bigger circles in the middle are mostly mainstream media sites. Things like The New York Times, CNN, The National Review, Slate, and Fox News.

But surrounding those are smaller ""fringe"" sites, or what Jonathan calls satellites. Jonathan thinks that the spread of fake news happens because of the way these fringe sites link to mainstream media.

So fringe sites ""surround"" traditional news media like satellites, by linking over and over again to their content.

""You can see that these smaller right-wing sites have basically populated the entire network of news...the left wing media and centre are distant from social media... if you look at this map, these smaller sites have basically populated the area around Google, around Youtube, around Twitter. So it shows an interesting strategy, almost like a virtual battleground,"" he says.

It's a pretty effective use of the web. Simply...linking. A LOT.

But in the run-up to the recent American election, it was even more effective because media like the New York Times, Washington Post and MSNBC essentially ignored these fringe sites. In doing so, they isolated themselves.

It goes beyond the simple sharing of links, Jonathan believes, because, when you think about it, that's always been the way news outlets establish their credibility online. But it gets a bit more ominous, he adds, when bots, or programs designed to mimic people, also join the fray, sharing links on social media - or even engaging in online conversation.

But even without the threat of bots, humans do a pretty good job of mucking things up.

So can this trend be reversed, or is the web being fundamentally destabilized, at least in the way people consume and use media?

""Maybe there needs to be a new definition of the web,"" he says. And, he adds, in a political sense, the left needs to engage the right in the same way.

NEW YORK (AP) — Twitter announced Tuesday that it is expanding efforts to protect its users from abuse and harassment, the latest milestone in a broader, growing corporate campaign to crack down on online hate.

The social media giant said it has begun identifying people who have been banned for abusive behavior and it will stop them from creating new accounts. The company said its changes, which also include a new “safe search” feature, will be implemented in the coming weeks.

In July, Twitter banned conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, an editor of the right-wing news site Breitbart News, for “participating in or inciting targeted abuse of individuals.” Twitter subsequently suspended the accounts of other prominent figureheads of the “alt-right” fringe movement, an amorphous mix of racism, white nationalism, xenophobia and anti-feminism.

Twitter has been under fire for failing to address hate and abuse on the site since its founding a decade ago. Balancing its reputation as a free speech haven has come into conflict with efforts to protect users.

Other internet companies have taken recent steps to curb abusive behavior and ban users who violate rules against promoting hate.

Reddit banned a forum for white nationalists from its social news website last Wednesday. A message at the link for the “r/altright” subreddit attributed its ban to an impermissible “proliferation of personal and confidential information.”

Also last week, the crowdfunding website GoFundMe removed a campaign for a conservative author and self-described “researcher” on the internet conspiracy theory known as “pizzagate,” which alleged with no evidence that Democrats were running a child sex ring out of a Washington, D.C., pizza shop. Brittany Pettibone had launched her GoFundMe campaign for a video podcast about “traditional values that once made Western Civilization great,” including “love of one’s own culture, race and country.”

GoFundMe spokesman Bobby Whithorne said in an email that Pettibone’s campaign was removed because it violated the company’s terms of service, which include rules against promoting hate, violence, harassment, discrimination, terrorism or “intolerance of any kind.” Pettibone, who declined to be interviewed, tweeted that GoFundMe didn’t specify how her campaign violated its terms of service.

Hate speech and promoting violence have long been barred under the terms of service of internet and social media companies such as Twitter and Facebook. But in the months leading up to the contentious presidential election, the emergence of the “alt-right” and high-profile trolling campaigns like one targeting “Ghostbusters” star Leslie Jones thrust the issue to the forefront.

In November, for instance, AppNexus announced that it removed Breitbart News from its online advertising network because it said the news outlet had violated its policy against hate speech. AppNexus, which connects buyers and sellers of online ad space,” determined that Breitbart “deployed crude racial, ethnic, gender, and sexual slurs in a way that could incite violence or discrimination against minority groups,” a spokesman said at the time.

The crackdown isn’t limited to far-right extremists. In August, Twitter said it had suspended some 360,000 accounts over the previous year for violating its policies banning the promotion of terrorism and violent extremism. But the company says the changes announced Tuesday are “unrelated to that and focused on abuse and harassment.”

Also on Tuesday, Twitter said it’s creating a “safe search” feature that removes tweets with potentially sensitive content and tweets from blocked and muted accounts from search results. The tweets will still exist on Twitter if people look for them, but won’t appear in general search results.

Twitter is also making some replies less visible so only the most relevant conversations surface.

Jennifer Grygiel, an assistant professor of communications at Syracuse University, said Twitter still relies too heavily on its users to root out and report abusive material.

“I have a simple fix: Just hire a lot more humans,” Grygiel said.

Don Black, whose Stormfront website is one of the oldest and most popular internet forums for white nationalists, said PayPal, Facebook and Amazon have cancelled his accounts since he launched the site in 1995. Andew Anglin, founder of neo-Nazi website called The Daily Stormer, also has said on his site that PayPal permanently shut down his online payment account in 2015.

“Nobody lasts very long on PayPal if you’re pro-white, which is unfortunate because a lot of people want to use PayPal to donate money,” said Black, who instead encourages his supporters to donate with bitcoin, an electronic currency.

Leaders of the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center say they frequently communicate with online companies to flag users spreading hate on their sites.

The North Carolina man who fired a rifle inside a Washington, D.C., pizzeria as he chased down an internet rumor related to Hillary Clinton was sentenced Thursday to four years behind bars.

Edgar Maddison Welch, 28, had pleaded guilty in March to two charges stemming from the Dec. 4 incident at the Comet Ping Pong restaurant. Prosecutors say he was self-investigating an online conspiracy theory — dubbed ""Pizzagate"" — that claimed the pizzeria was harboring a child sex-trafficking ring with connections to influential Democrats. Washington police and the FBI denied the theories had any substance.

Federal Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson said Thursday that even though Welch didn't harm anyone, his unsound actions ""literally left psychological wreckage,"" according to The Associated Press.

Jackson added that Welch still went ahead with his ""ill-conceived plot"" when others warned him not to, and that he should have simply contacted law enforcement if he believed the restaurant was engaged in something illicit — instead of driving the more than 4-1/2 hours from his home to the nation's capital to ""rescue"" the nonexistent children.

Welch apologized for his actions and told the judge that he ""cannot undo or change what already happened,"" the AP added.

Welch's attorney sought a sentence of 1-1/2 years, while prosecutors asked the judge for as much as 4-1/2 years.

He had initially been arraigned on charges of assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a pistol without a license and other crimes. Prosecutors say he was armed with an AR-15 rifle and a .38 caliber handgun during the bizarre episode.

Witnesses told police that they heard Welch fire three times inside the restaurant. He surrendered peacefully after finding no evidence of sex trafficking.

The New York Times reported in November that Pizzagate appeared to have come from the email hacking of Hillary Clinton's former presidential campaign chair, John Podesta, who casually knows the owner.

Podesta and he previously shared emails about a fundraiser, which in turn ramped up speculation about a child-abuse ring that gained momentum on internet message boards despite there being no validity to it.",mainstream,M13c8a,pizzagate

( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)

WASHINGTON (AP) — There’s at least a slice of good news for a pizza restaurant in the nation’s capital caught up in fake news stories about a child sex trafficking ring run by prominent Democrats.

In the days since a conspiracy theorist showed up and fired an assault weapon inside Comet Ping Pong, supporters of the restaurant have turned out in droves to buy pizzas and leave homemade signs and flowers.

More than 2,000 people said on Facebook that they’re going to this weekend’s “Stand With Comet” event to support the pizza place and other neighborhood restaurants targeted by fake news fanatics.

John McKeel walked out of Comet Ping Pong Friday carrying “The Smoky,” with mushrooms and bacon; and “The Jimmy,” topped with meatballs. But McKeel wasn’t just coming for the food.

“I had to come today” to support the restaurant, said McKeel, 39, of Alexandria, Virginia.

The Facebook page urged people to support not only Comet Ping Pong but other nearby stores that have been subjected to harassing and threatening online comments and phone calls since the fake news stories began spreading.

“If they run out of dough today, that’d be a good thing,” said Erick Sanchez, the event’s organizer.

So many came out Friday that people waited an hour and a half for a table and carry-out took 45 minutes. Other local restaurants spontaneously sent over wait staff to help. Others sent food for employees.

The restaurant also is getting support online, where a GoFundMe page set up to help it pay for legal expenses and extra security had passed $15,000, with a goal of $28,000.

Interim District of Columbia Police Chief Peter Newsham visited Friday, with a message for fake news peddlers.

“It’s not funny. It’s serious. It can have very, very serious consequences,” he said, adding that police are following up on the harassment and threats local businesses have received.

The man police arrested Sunday at Comet Ping Pong, Edgar Maddison Welch, has a court hearing next week. Police have said the 28-year-old from Salisbury, N.C., fired shots from an AR-15 assault weapon after coming to “self-investigate” the conspiracy theory known as “pizzagate.”

He surrendered peacefully “when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant,” police said.

Joey Allen, the marketing and events manager for the District Restaurant Group, which owns the nearby Jake’s American Grille, says its restaurant also was harassed with calls related to the conspiracy. At one point the calls were daily, Allen said.

At Comet Ping Pong, the staff seemed to be in a good mood Friday, said Carrie Gillispie, 34, visiting with her husband. She wasn’t bothered by the lines for tables.

“It makes me happy that the wait is so long,” she said.

Her husband, Sean Gillispie, 34, said anyone who still thinks the restaurant is somehow connected to nefarious activities should come see for themselves that “this is just a normal business with normal people.”

Plus, he said: “The pizza is really good.”",mainstream,M15f07,pizzagate

430,"Washington Times mischaracterizes his quote as part of ‘PizzaGate’ demonization campaign

The Washington Times has launched a ‘fake news’ smear against Alex Jones by mischaracterizing his quote to suggest that Jones accused Hillary Clinton of chopping up children as part of the ‘PizzaGate’ controversy.

An article by Andrew Blake entitled Infowars’ Alex Jones appeals to Trump for aid over fears of ‘fake news’ crackdown states that Jones, “Claimed the president-elect’s former White House rival Hillary Clinton “personally murdered and chopped up” children during a November broadcast.”

However, as even the Washington Post admitted, Jones’ quote was in the context of Hillary’s murderous policies in Libya and Syria, which led to an international migrant crisis and the rise of ISIS, a group that literally chops up children.

“Jones eventually tied his comments about Clinton to U.S. policy in Syria,” acknowledged the Post.

This crucial clarification is completely missing from the Washington Times article, which goes on to roll the quote into a discussion about PizzaGate, implying that Jones was accusing Clinton of chopping up children in the basements of pizza parlors – when he was talking in the context of her disastrous foreign policy.

The failure of the Washington Times to put the quote in its correct context and to then roll it into a completely unrelated context is extremely deceptive and suggests that the supposedly conservative Washington Times is now pushing the same “fake news” narrative as the rest of the mainstream media.

As the Post article also reveals, the first time the #PizzaGate hashtag appeared on Twitter was November 7, while Infowars didn’t carry any stories about the issue until November 24, when we featured a story about why PizzaGate was being censored by Reddit.

The media is obsessed with suggesting that Infowars was the source of the ‘PizzaGate’ controversy, despite the fact that it was discussed weeks before we even covered it. The whole narrative is an obvious ploy to claim that so-called “fake news” represents a violent threat, as Hillary Clinton asserted earlier this week, and that Infowars is to blame.

However, Glenn Greenwald has exposed, the origin of the fake news issue can actually be traced back to Hillary Clinton supporter Marco Chacon, who started circulating fake quotes attributed to Clinton contained in John Podesta emails in an effort bait Trump supporters into sharing them.

“Sadly for Chacon, however, the people who ended up getting fooled by his Fake News items were the nation’s most prominent Clinton supporters, including supposed experts and journalists from MSNBC who used his obvious fakes to try to convince the world that the Wikileaks archive had been compromised and thus should be ignored,” writes Greenwald.

In other words, the entire fake news narrative was started by Democratic operatives in a bid to discredit the Podesta emails. Those same operatives are now using the same fake news scandal they created to try to censor legitimate news sources like Infowars and Breitbart.

While Infowars is under constant attack for being responsible for “fake news,” many mainstream reporters and commentators on the left amplified this fake news narrative for weeks with wanton abandon. Clintonite celebrities like Amy Schumer also circulated fake quotes in a bid to smear Donald Trump but were never called out for it by the mainstream media.

Both Greenwald and the Rolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi have also completely debunked the McCarthyite blacklists of “fake news” published by mainstream media outlets.

The first list of “fake news” websites was exposed as the bias-driven musings of a far-left social justice warrior, while the Washington Post itself was forced to admit that it couldn’t “vouch for the validity” of the “Russian propaganda” list it published.

The MSM’s “fake news” narrative is crumbling, but they will continue to double down in an effort to force tech giants like Google and Facebook into strangling the corporate media’s competition.

513,"In late 2016, the government’s spin machine made it a point to feature “pizza gate,” only to mock anyone who would ever believe it to be true. The thought that high-level government officials in the U.S. would or could ever be involved in sex-trafficking or pedophilia was presented as far-fetched conspiracy theory, only believed by the fringe elements of society. But as The Free Thought Project has reported on numerous occasions, pedophilia involving high-level government officials is becoming the norm rather than the exception.

In the North Bengal region of India, a child welfare officer, India’s equivalent of a Child Protective Services official was arrested for her role in a child-trafficking ring. Sasmita Ghosh’s arrest makes the seventh as of late. The State’s Criminal Investigative Department (CID) made the arrests. According to the Hindu, “The CID had unearthed the child trafficking racket during raids at homes and nursing homes in Baduria area of North 24 Parganas district, in Behala in the southern fringes of Kolkata and some other parts of south Bengal in November last year.”

Abortion clinics in the area were convincing mothers to give birth to their children in exchange for money ranging between $1,400 and $4,500 USD. Other birthing centers told mothers their children were stillborn, when they weren’t, allowing the clinic to steal the babies for sale on the black market. The children were transported in bread baskets to nursing homes in the area where they would remain until they were sold into servitude, as sex slaves, or brothels.

“It is a huge network of NGOs, nursing homes, doctors and middlemen dealing in illegal adoption and baby trafficking that the police have busted. Our men are now building on the huge leads they have already got in this case,” Rajesh Kumar, CID’s Additional Director General told the press. Additionally, investigators believe foreigners were buying the children. Currency from other countries was found at the same time the children were discovered. Several corpses and skeletons of infants were also unearthed in the raided businesses.

Child trafficking is on the rise in the U.S. In 2006, a woman living in North Carolina, Mercedes Farquharson, fled the country when it was discovered she’d been using two young girls as house slaves, forced to farm the land, and do all the household chores, along with cooking and cleaning. In 2009, she was arrested in Bulgaria, where she’d fled to escape justice.

The trafficking of children isn’t limited to lowly child-protective service workers either. Hama Amadou, an opposition leader in the Sahel state of Niger was sentenced to one year in prison for providing babies to Niger’s elite society. “Prosecutors claim that Amadou was one of a group of people accused of smuggling babies from Nigeria via Benin to wealthy couples in Niger by falsely claiming the parenthood of around 30 children,” according to Deutsche Welle (DW), Germany’s international newsgroup. Childlessness is Niger is looked down upon, so one way the elitists solved their own infertility problem was to take someone else’s child as their own.

DW described what happened after they acquired a child, “At the turn of the last decade, Niger’s elite went through a baby boom. Women who had been childless for years were suddenly celebrating the birth of their first child.” The miraculous blessings of motherhood reportedly came at the expense of someone else’s presumably stolen, purchased, or seized baby. Amadou was tried in asentia and his lawyer says the allegations are politically motivated.

Closer to home, Child Protective Services, as TFTP has consistently reported, is authorized to kidnap children at will, and place those children in foster care homes. The government’s own agency charged with protecting children, routinely displaces babies, children, and adolescents away from their parents in order to supposedly protect those children.

Many of those same CPS workers are abusers as well, who sometimes place those kidnapped children in the homes of sexual predators, where they are routinely victimized. The terrorist organization evokes fear in the hearts of so many parents. The power CPS possesses is legally unmatched in all of society. If you’d like to peruse our archives of CPS articles, you can do so by clicking here. Children are being ripped from their parents for something as innocent and well-intentioned as homeschooling.

If child trafficking arrests of government officials can happen around the world, why is it so far-fetched to think it cannot and does not happen here in the U.S.? The reality of the situation is that it is not at all far-fetched and even admitted. But the American spin machine is able to make anyone who talks about it look like a crazy person. The problem is getting so large, however, these sickos are having a hard time keeping it under wraps. As the Free Thought Project previously reported, former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney says if the government actually investigated it, child trafficking would destroy both Democrats and Republicans.

The film surveys the effects of disinformation campaigns occurring on social media and the impacts of well known conspiracy theories from Obama birther theories and Jade Helm, to Seth Rich, to Pizzagate, as well as some of the major and minor personalities involved. ""Disinformation"" is the intentional dissemination of falsehoods.[3] The documentary shows that although the elements of fake news are not new, modern fake news is enhanced and amplified by information technology. The roots of fake news are distrust and exploitation. ""Inevitably, [the film] confronts the question of what we should do about fake news.""[1][2] It also shows the background of two conspiracy theorists to create and promote a conspiracy theory regarding Robert Mueller in order to smear him while serving as special counsel.[5]

The film's main theme[3] is framed by ""dash-cam footage of Edgar Maddison Welch"" as he drove with a high powered gun from North Carolina to Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in Washington, D.C. with intent to stop what he delusively believed to be a ""child sex slave ring"".[1] The film shows the Pizzagate conspiracy growing on Reddit and 4chan, how it was fomented by the alt-right and Alex Jones, which then translated into a real-life dangerous situation[3] that occurred beyond the internet.[1]

A new one is on the way, and the old one is going to end with a bang. Sinclair explains, “Right now, they’re eating each other, and the eventuality is, getting back to the steam pot, there is going to be a day when there is only going to be one shark left, one very fat shark left, and what happens next? That shark starves to death because it ate all the food. So, the end of this is the explosion of that steam cooker which is called capitalism.”

Sinclair goes on to point out, “The over-the-counter derivatives have grown massively beyond world money availability. This has no precedent. We have killed capitalism. Thanks to the high tech guys, they have shot the goose with the golden egg. In the markets, if you go in and look at the New York Stock Exchange when I was down there, you’d have thousands of people there. Now, you’ve got 35 maybe. The market is killed, and there is no market in anything–including gold or silver except as it’s utilized to try to put some sense and rescue back into the whole system because there is no other alternative. This is what Trump has inherited. . . . If rates (on the 10-year Treasury bond) break 3%, it’s going to turn the algorithms away from everything else and on to one thing, the largest market in the world—interest rates. You are going to see the fastest moving interest rates just like when Trump was elected. That’s what the interest rate market is going to look like. That’s going to have an impact on every single derivative out there because every derivative out there has an interest rate criteria. So, you have a pressure cooker bomb cooking like the terrorists use. It’s cooking, and it makes gold a storehouse of value and not a currency. It’s just a storehouse of value. It turns it into a savings account. The only one that will work. The only one without a counter-party. The only one that doesn’t need a market that can trade in physical (metal) and huge size physical. China and Russia are not buying gold as some sort of investment. They are buying it as a policy because they see clearly that is no tool left in anybody’s toolbox to fix what the geeks have done. They have killed us, and they have killed themselves. There is one fat shark out there that is now about to experience starvation.”

In closing, Sinclair says, “When it’s all said and done, there will be a catastrophic big bang, and then the only thing that will be left is your savings account. Your savings account is not silver, although it will outperform gold, your savings account is going to be gold. It’s going to happen because all currencies, even the roaring dollar, are falling in terms of being a storehouse of value. Capitalism is finished. I can’t tell you what the next system will be, but capitalism is over because the heart of capitalism is markets. Without markets, you cannot have a capitalistic system—it’s over.”

What made Game of Thrones the most popular show in the world?

Michelle: ""Game of Thrones got lucky in that it premiered at this moment where geek culture was exploding into the mainstream.

Sam: ""I think the show's legacy is going to be showing a new way forward for TV. It showed that you can throw an enormous amount of money at the right subject and still create the kind of appointment television where everyone is glued to their TV at nine o'clock on a Sunday night, waiting to see what happens. And they're going to be stunned at each new plot development.""

 If there is a total of 79 deaths, and there is an estimated 500-600 residents of the building, where are the rest?

 Where are the survivors of the Grenfell Tower Fire?

 

 It turned out that not only did the UK government is so slow at counting the dead bodies at the Grenfell Tower fire, it is also so callous in attending the few who just survived hell.

Survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire are sleeping rough in parks and cars, according to the newly elected Labour MP for Kensington.

 Emma Dent Coad said the borough was in “total chaos” and suffering from “appalling” coordination nearly a week on from the blaze that is believed to have killed at least 79 people.

 “People have been sleeping in cars and in parks because they don’t know where to go and they aren’t being looked after,” she told Sky News.

 “The coordination is appalling. Somebody told me this morning they are still this morning running around like headless chickens – that was something somebody from the inside [said].”

 She said many people were worried about accepting the Government’s payouts for fear it would impact on their benefit support.

 Downing Street said residents who lost their homes would receive a down payment of at least £5,500 after outrage that residents were only being handed £10 a day.

Was there a deliberate effort to bring down the building?

The cause of the inferno was traced to the substandard plastic cladding that’s been installed to hide the “ugly building” from the view of the oligarchs living nearby.

 However, the names of those who died may give us a glimpse of why they qualified for the holocaust.

Of those who died, five have so far been formally identified. The most recent is Khadija Khalloufi, 52, who lived on the 17th floor with her husband, Sabah Abdullah, a retired lecturer, who had grabbed her hand as they fled but lost his grip in the stampede to escape.

 Others formally identified are: Syrian refugee and engineering student Mohammad Alhajali, 23; artist and photographer Khadija Saye, 24; Abufars Ibrahim, 39; and retired lorry driver Anthony Disson, 65.

 Omar Belkadi is also among those to have died, his brother-in-law Ahmed told the Guardian. Also missing is Belkadi’s wife, Farah Hamdan, and their six-month-old daughter, Leena Belkadi.

 Ahmed Belkadi said: “Omar was found with ID on his body, but they still haven’t told us where or when he was found or where he was taken to.”

They made us homemade pizza. It was an amazing time. I sat next to Bono. It was a great day.”

Sandler goes on to explain that these kinds of experiences are once in a lifetime, even for him.

“Every time I’m with Jennifer [Aniston] something great happens because everybody loves Jennifer and I tend to stay at home and do nothing,” he says with a laugh. “My wife [Jackie] is so much going, ‘Why didn’t I marry Aniston? Why am I stuck with you?’ Even in Italy she’s like, ‘I’m telling you we gotta leave the room, man.'”

Though the father of two admits the night out at the Clooneys’ was “a good time and I should do it more,” he tends to prefer a more low-key schedule: “I like hanging out with the kids. I like hanging out with the wife. I like playing basketball and I then like going to sleep.”

The Clooneys’ pizza parties are so incredible thanks in part to 33-year-old Como, Italy, native and award-winning chef, Viviana Frizzi, who makes pies for their family once a week.

Last year, George told PEOPLE about how Frizzi picks up the culinary slack since they are not very skilled in that department.

“Vivi cooks almost every night for us now because we have the twins,” he added. “Going out isn’t as easy or as interesting as it used to be. Besides all of our friends would rather eat her food than hit up a local restaurant in Como or in London.”

76,"Police searching for a Wisconsin man considered armed and dangerous stepped up patrols on Sunday at churches near his home because of anti-religious views expressed in a manifesto he sent to U.S. President Donald Trump, officials said.

Joseph A. Jakubowski, 32, is wanted for breaking into a gun shop called Armageddon Supplies in his home town of Janesville, about 110 kilometres southwest of Milwaukee, on Tuesday, when several handguns and rifles were stolen, according to the Rock County Sheriff's Office.

Later that night, his truck was found nearby engulfed in flames, the Sheriff's Office said in a statement. Police believe Jakubowski torched the truck.

Investigators who analyzed the manifesto were also concerned about ""anti-religious views"" in the document, which Jakubowski can be seen mailing to Trump in a video posted to social media.

As a precaution, law enforcement officers increased their patrols at local churches and other places of worship on Sunday but no disturbances were reported, the Rock County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.

At least one Wisconsin church shut its doors. Bethlehem Lutheran in Sun Prairie, less than 80 km north of Janesville, cancelled services after a man who was believed to resemble Jakubowski visited the church on Thursday. Investigators have not verified if it was Jakubowski.

A force of 150 law enforcement personnel, including Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, continued their manhunt for Jakubowski on Sunday.

Jakubowski, who served time in prison for trying to wrestle a gun away from a police officer, is believed to have become agitated about politics recently, authorities said.

A person who knows Jakubowski said he had spoken of his plans to steal guns and stage some kind of attack, possibly at a school, Spoden said.

It was unclear if Jakubowski, who according to local media was unemployed, remains in Wisconsin or if he had left the state. Federal agents were pursuing leads in other parts of the country.

771,"A protester who filmed the violent clashes at a white supremacist rally last year in Virginia sued far-right news site InfoWars and its leader Alex Jones on Tuesday, saying the site stoked conspiracy theories that he was working as a “deep state” operative for the government.

Brennan Gilmore, a foreign service officer at the State Department, alleges that Jones, his website and several of its contributors made “false and defamatory” statements by claiming he had an “ax to grind” in recording the event.

The lawsuit, filed by Georgetown University law school's civil rights clinic on behalf of Gilmore in Virginia district court, alleges the defendants “caused irreparable damage” to Gilmore’s reputation “and threatened his physical and emotional well-being.” The group seeks compensation and punitive damages from Jones and other defendants.

“From Sandy Hook to ‘Pizzagate’ to Charlottesville, Las Vegas and now Parkland, the defendants thrive by inciting devastating real-world consequences with the propaganda and lies they publish as ‘news,’” Gilmore said in a statement. “Today, I’m asking a court to hold them responsible for the personal and professional damage their lies have caused me, and, more importantly, to deter them from repeating this dangerous pattern of defamation and intimidation.”

Gilmore in August filmed portions of the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where violence erupted as white supremacists and neo-Nazis clashed with counter-protesters. At the rally, he captured video of the moment a vehicle rammed into a large crowd, injuring 19 people and killing one.

InfoWars, a right-wing news site known for peddling unsubstantiated conspiracies, cited Gilmore’s ties to the federal government to allege the existence of a coordinated effort to ""orchestrate"" the clashes and undermine the President Donald Trump, who faced backlash for his response to the event.

Beyond Jones, the lawsuit implicates the website’s operating company, Free Speech System, InfoWars contributors Lee Ann McAdoo and Lee Stranah, and several other fringe right-wing media figures.

“The First Amendment does not and cannot protect deliberate lies designed to incite incessant harassment and violence against private citizens,” Andrew Mendrala, supervising attorney of the civil rights clinic, said in a statement. “This case is a simple defense of democracy. A well-informed public is essential to a healthy democracy. But a deliberately misinformed public is fatal to it.”",mainstream,M0e7df,pizzagate
570,"The inspiration for the majority of fictional fake-news storylines would appear to be Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist, radio host, and founder of Infowars. Jones has propagated, variously, theories that 9/11 was an inside job, that the Sandy Hook shootings were a false-flag operation, that the Oklahoma bombings were organized by the U.S. government, and that Hillary Clinton was involved in a child-trafficking ring operated out of a D.C. pizzeria—the last of which he was forced to retract last week, or risk a libel suit. President Donald Trump, who has on occasion voiced statements seemingly inspired by Infowars posts, is a fan of Jones and his site, and has previously described Jones’s reputation as “amazing.”

Homeland’s Brett O’Keefe seems modeled on Jones—so obviously so that Infowars published a post complaining about the show’s “not-so subtle inference ... that anyone who listens to Alex Jones is violent and semi-deranged.” But Jones also seems to have been the inspiration for the character Tad O’Malley (Joel McHale) in the 2016 revival of The X-Files, and for the unnamed broadcaster in the 2016 film Arrival who spurs members of the military to take their own violent action against the heptapods. In The X-Files, which is itself something of a conspiracy theorist’s fever dream, O’Malley turns out to be vindicated—the government has indeed injected every American citizen with alien DNA in the guise of vaccines, which makes them vulnerable to a killer virus. (Why exactly the government would go to all this extraordinary effort is never made clear.) But this favorable depiction of a Jones-like figure is the exception. Other cultural portrayals of fake-news peddlers show them wreaking misinformation for nefarious reasons, or directly motivating others to commit atrocities.

O’Keefe, for example, is part of a characteristically complex Homeland plot about an effort to undermine the president-elect, by doctoring footage of her son—who was killed in combat—to make it seem like he was a coward. Apparently, this fake-news network is so sprawling and well-connected that it allows for the execution of FBI agents who randomly happen upon its headquarters, and is well-funded enough to hire former intelligence agents looking to cash out. Its essential function, after weeks of buildup, is almost a disappointment when revealed: a basement full of tech-savvy Americans using dummy social-media profiles to spread fake news that makes Elizabeth Keane look bad. On the one hand, it’s laughable; on the other, Homeland’s female president was at least elected before the malicious misinformation campaign against her took off.

With stories like this, the Showtime series is continuing its habit of basing plot points on real geopolitical events, while also seemingly trying to make amends for previous storylines, which have been criticized for encouraging Islamophobia. But it’s also—whether deliberately or not—contributing to a greater sense of what fake news is, and where it comes from.

107,"In November 2017, a small-time YouTube video creator and two moderators of the 4chan website, one of the most extreme message boards on the internet, banded together and plucked out of obscurity an anonymous and cryptic post from the many conspiracy theories that populated the website's message board.

Over the next several months, they would create videos, a Reddit community, a business and an entire mythology based off the 4chan posts of “Q,” the pseudonym of a person claiming to be a high-ranking military officer. The theory they espoused would become Qanon, and it would eventually make its way from those message boards to national media stories and the rallies of President Donald Trump.

Now, the people behind that effort are at the center of a fractious debate among conspiracy enthusiasts, some of whom believe the three people who first popularized the Qanon theory are promoting it in order to make a living. Others suggest that these original followers actually wrote Q’s mysterious posts.

While the identity of the original author or authors behind “Q” is still unknown, the history of the conspiracy theory’s spread is well-documented — through YouTube videos, social media posts, Reddit archives, and public records reviewed by NBC News.

NBC News has found that the theory can be traced back to three people who sparked some of the first conversation about Qanon and, in doing so, attracted followers who they then asked to help fund Qanon “research.”

Qanon is a convoluted conspiracy theory with no apparent foundation in reality. The heart of it asserts that for the last year the anonymous “Q” has taken to the fringe internet message boards of 4chan and 8chan to leak intelligence about Trump’s top-secret war with a cabal of criminals run by politicians like Hillary Clinton and the Hollywood elite. There is no evidence for these claims.

In addition to peeking into the mainstream, the theory has been increasingly linked to real-world violence. In recent months, Qanon followers have allegedly been involved in a foiled presidential assassination plot, a devastating California wildfire, and an armed standoff with local law enforcement officers in Arizona.

Part of the Qanon appeal lies in its game-like quality. Followers wait for clues left by “Q” on the message board. When the clues appear, believers dissect the riddle-like posts alongside Trump’s speeches and tweets and news articles in an effort to validate the main narrative that Trump is winning a war against evil.

There are now dozens of commentators who dissect “Q” posts — on message boards, in YouTube videos and on their personal pages — but the theory was first championed by a handful of people who worked together to stir discussion of the “Q” posts, eventually pushing the theory on to bigger platforms and gaining followers — a strategy that proved to be the key to Qanon’s spread and the originators’ financial gain.

Before Q, there was a wide variety of “anon” 4chan posters all claiming to have special government access.

In 2016, there was FBIAnon, a self-described “high-level analyst and strategist” offering intel about the 2016 investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Then came HLIAnon, an acronym for High Level Insider, who posted about various dubious conspiracies in riddles, including one that claimed Princess Diana had been killed because she found out about 9/11 “beforehand” and had “tried to stop it.” Then “CIAAnon” and “CIA Intern” took to the boards in early 2017, and last August one called WH Insider Anon offered a supposed preview that something that was “going to go down” regarding the DNC and leaks.

Qanon was just another unremarkable part of the “anon” genre until November 2017, when two moderators of the 4chan board where Q posted predictions, who went by the usernames Pamphlet Anon and BaruchtheScribe, reached out to Tracy Diaz, according to Diaz’s blogs and YouTube videos. BaruchtheScribe, in reality a self-identified web programmer from South Africa named Paul Furber, confirmed that account to NBC News.

“A bunch of us decided that the message needed to go wider so we contacted Youtubers who had been commenting on the Q drops,” Furber said in an email.

Diaz, a small-time YouTube star who once hosted a talk show on the fringe right-wing network Liberty Movement Radio, had found moderate popularity with a couple of thousand views for her YouTube videos analyzing WikiLeaks releases and discussing the ""pizzagate"" conspiracy, a baseless theory that alleged a child sex ring was being run out of a Washington pizza shop.

As Diaz tells it in a blog post detailing her role in the early days of Qanon, she banded together with the two moderators. Their goal, according to Diaz, was to build a following for Qanon — which would mean bigger followings for them as well.

On Nov. 3, 2017, just six days after the first 4chan post from “Q,” Diaz posted a video entitled “/POL/- Q Clearance Anon - Is it #happening???” in which she introduced the conspiracy theory to her audience.

“I do not typically do videos like this,” she said, but citing Q’s “very specific and kind of eerie” posts, Diaz explained that she would be covering the 4chan posts, “just in case this stuff turns out to be legit because honestly it kind of seems legit.”

That video, which has been viewed nearly 250,000 times, made Diaz one of the earliest people to seize on “Q” posts and decipher them for a conspiracy-hungry audience. Diaz followed with dozens more Q-themed videos, each containing a call for viewers to donate through links to her Patreon and PayPal accounts

Diaz’s YouTube channel now boasts more than 90,000 subscribers and her videos have been watched over 8 million times. More than 97,000 people follow her on Twitter. Diaz, who emerged from bankruptcy in 2009, says in her YouTube videos that she now relies on donations from patrons funding her YouTube “research” as her sole source of income.

Diaz declined to comment on this story.

“Because I cover Q, I got an audience,” Diaz acknowledged in a video that NBC News reviewed last week before she deleted it.

To reach a more mainstream audience (older people and “normies,” who on their own would have trouble navigating the fringe message boards), Diaz said in a blog post she recommended they move to the more user-friendly Reddit. Archives listing the three as the original posters and moderators show they created a new Reddit community called CBTS_Stream, short for Calm Before The Storm, where subscribers soon gathered to talk all things Q.

Their move to Reddit was key to Qanon’s eventual spread. There, they were able to tap into a larger audience of conspiracy theorists, and drive discussion with their analysis of each Q post. From there, Qanon crept to Facebook where it found a new, older audience via dozens of public and private groups.

That audience then started to head to 8chan to check out the original source and interact directly with the posts. (Q posts moved from 4chan to its more toxic offshoot 8chan in November after a post claiming the original board had been “infiltrated.” 8chan became notorious for having no rules, and even hosting child pornography.)

8chan’s owner’s official Twitter account marveled at the influx of older, less internet-savvy visitors to his site, drawn by Qanon. “We joked about it for years, but #Qanon is making it a reality: Boomers! On your imageboard.”

Meanwhile, Diaz kept making videos, racking up hundreds of thousands of views. Over the next several months, Diaz and the two moderators picked up tens of thousands of followers on Reddit and YouTube and added even more moderators to their 8chan and Reddit boards.

They also began to break into what might be considered the mainstream of the conspiracy world. Conspiracy theorist Dr. Jerome Corsi, an Infowars editor and a best-selling author of books about the “deep state,” had taken an interest in Q and was decoding the messages on the Reddit board. In December, Pamphlet Anon and BaruchtheScribe even made an appearance on InfoWars.

Corsi has since disavowed the Qanon conspiracy and called the current Q poster “a fraud,” citing a supposed takeover of the channel by someone posing as Q in April. But last week, facing backlash from his base, Corsi tweeted that he supports the Qanon movement and its supporters’ “excellent research.”

Soon, as Diaz explained on her blog, their expanding crew was spending all their waking hours in chat rooms on the gaming-focused forum Discord analyzing and decoding Q messages and planning for a larger dissemination of Q’s message.

In March, their Reddit board, which boasted some 20,000 subscribers, was shut down by Reddit for “encouraging or inciting violence and posting personal and confidential information,” and the moderators — Diaz and the rest — were banned from the site. Furber had already been booted from the site for allegedly threatening to reveal the personal details of another user, and was pushed out of the private Q discussion groups he had helped form.

“I was very definitely banished,” Furber said, noting that he believes Q’s board has been taken over by imposters.

By then, Pamphlet Anon, whose real name is Coleman Rogers, had developed grander plans. (NBC was able to determine Rogers’ identity through property records that link the address where his business is registered to his parent’s home and to photos from his personal social media account. Those photos show him to be the same person who appears on YouTube as Pamphlet Anon.)

Rogers did not respond to calls seeking comment, but acknowledged his receipt of messages from NBC News via his website’s Twitter, writing in part, “WE DO NOT TALK TO FAKE NEWS.”

Kicked off Reddit, Rogers hatched a new plan. He would replace the mainstream media — often a target of Q’s posts — with a constantly streaming YouTube network made up of the self-described “researchers” who were putting together Q’s clues.

Within a month, Rogers, 31, and his wife, Christina Urso, 29, had launched the Patriots’ Soapbox, a round-the-clock livestreamed YouTube channel for Qanon study and discussion. The channel is, in effect, a broadcast of a Discord chatroom with constant audio commentary from a rotating cast of volunteers and moderators with sporadic appearances by Rogers and Urso. In April, Urso registered Patriots’ Soapbox LLC in Virginia.

Rogers and Urso use their channel to call for donations that are accepted through PayPal, cryptocurrencies or mail.

It was a natural progression for Rogers. A review of Rogers’ Facebook page shows he had been active in internet politics and a staunch supporter of Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign, self-identifying as part of the “meme war” — the creation and dissemination of images and internet-style commentary that internet agitators on the chans and Reddit credit with Trump’s win. Rogers often posted memes about “liberal tears” as well as the ludicrous claims that Democrats murdered children and worshipped Satan — details similar to those that would eventually form the Qanon theory.

Rogers’ Facebook updates waned after Trump took office but started up again in the fall, when he began posting “Q” messages to both confused and supportive family and friends.

Rogers has publicly denied that he is the author of the “Q” posts, though his last visible Facebook post, published on Aug. 2, hinted that he might someday be associated with the theory.

“Ten bucks says you see my face on national news within a few weeks, saying that I'm ‘the mysterious hacker known as #Qanon,’” Rogers wrote, a reference to a CNN segment that mistakenly referred to the website 4chan as a hacker.

Following a request for comment from NBC News, Rogers deleted every post on his Facebook profile after 2014. Following another message from a reporter informing him that NBC News had archived his page, he deleted his Facebook account entirely.

As Qanon picked up steam, growing skepticism over the motives of Diaz, Rogers, and the other early Qanon supporters led some in the internet’s conspiracy circles to turn their paranoia on the group.

Recently, some Qanon followers have accused Diaz and Rogers of profiting from the movement by soliciting donations from their followers. Other pro-Trump online groups have questioned the roles that Diaz and Rogers have played in promoting Q, pointing to a series of slip-ups that they say show Rogers and Diaz may have been involved in the theory from the start.

Those accusations have led Diaz and Rogers to both deny that they are Q and say they don’t know who Q is. There is no direct proof that the group or any individual members are behind it.

Still, Qanon skeptics have pointed to two videos as evidence that Rogers had insider knowledge of Q’s account. Some YouTube channels, like one named Unirock, are mostly dedicated to poring over Patriots’ Soapbox livestreams and dissecting purported slip-ups.

One archived livestream appears to show Rogers logging into the 8chan account of “Q.”The Patriots’ Soapbox feed quickly cuts out after the login attempt. “Sorry, leg cramp,” Rogers says, before the feed reappears seconds later.

Users in the associated chatroom begin to wonder if Rogers had accidentally revealed his identity as Q. “How did you post as Q?” one user wrote.

In another livestreamed video, Rogers begins to analyze a supposed “Q” post on his livestream program when his co-host points out that the post in question doesn’t actually appear on Q’s feed and was authored anonymously. Rogers’ explanation — that Q must have forgotten to sign in before posting — was criticized as extremely unlikely by people familiar with the message boards, as it would require knowledge of the posting to pick it out among hundreds of other anonymous ones.

In part because of the mounting claims against Patriots’ Soapbox, the web’s largest pro-Trump community has banned all mentions of Qanon. Reddit’s 640,000-member community r/The_Donald set up an autodelete function for mentions of Qanon’s claims, two moderators confirmed to NBC News, believing the group of YouTubers is making posts as Q.

Still, Patriots’ Soapbox 24-hour livestream remains live on YouTube, broadcasting to its 46,000 subscribers. And despite the growing skepticism of the group, they still have their supporters who ardently believe in the Qanon theory.

1111,"Unhinged actor in yet another bizarre outburst aimed at Mike Cernovich.

Trump hating actor Tom Arnold launched another bizarre Twitter outburst when he appeared to wish for Roger Stone’s death by suggesting the former Trump confidant would end up like Jeffrey Epstein.

Stone was convicted on 7 counts in his federal trial today and faces a jail sentence of up to 50 years.

Journalists who spoke to Stone in recent days says he fears being ‘Epsteined’ in jail, a reference to the “suicide” of the billionaire sex trafficker which many people think was a deliberate assassination.

In response to Mike Cernovich, who tweeted, “Roger Stone was prosecuted more aggressively than Jeffrey Epstein, that tells you all you need to know about the rule of law in America,” Arnold responded, “Roger Stone & Jeffery Epstein were very close to Donald Trump. Then they died in prison. Who’s next Pizzagate?”

Despite facing a potential long stretch behind bars, Stone has not yet “died in prison.”

The tweet was also a veiled threat against Mike Cernovich since the tweet was a response to Cernovich, who has mockingly been referred to the as the “pizzagate guy” by the media.

Arnold is clearly suggesting that Cernovich should be the next person to ‘die in prison’ like Epstein and potentially Stone if he is slapped with a lengthy sentence.

This is by no means the first time Arnold has suffered a Twitter meltdown.

Last month, he falsely accused Jack Posobiec of trafficking child porn, opening up clear grounds for a lawsuit.

Earlier that same month, Arnold raised the prospect of another JFK-style assassination after President Trump arrived in Dallas, Texas for an event at the American Airlines Center.

As we previously highlighted, the actor’s wife claimed that Arnold’s obsession with Donald Trump combined with his drug addiction led to the end of their marriage.

“Tom’s fixation on ‘taking down’ Donald Trump was an ongoing issue in our marriage,” said Arnold’s wife, adding “For the past two years it has consumed his life and presented numerous safety issues for our family.”

She also accused the actor of “abuse of prescription drugs,” namely Phentermine and Fenfluramine.

44,"But Zuckerberg’s absurd acrobatics on Holocaust denial don’t mean that his critics have offered a better solution to the problem, when they call for simply erasing any mendacious material.

There are two reasons why censorship is not an adequate response to bigoted misinformation. The first is that censorship suppresses a symptom of hate, not the source. Silencing speech does not rebut it, and punishing those who express hateful views can just as easily make them into martyrs and lend their views greater notoriety. This is one reason why Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism continue to thrive across Europe, far more so than in the United States, despite the many laws against Holocaust denial in those countries, from France to Belgium. You cannot legislate away a worldview; you need to counter it.

The second reason that censorship is not an effective response to internet anti-Semitism and racism is that erasing online hate erodes awareness of the bigotry in the real world. After all, it’s easy to pretend your society doesn’t have a prejudice problem when your social-media platforms are systematically suppressing all evidence of it.

To take one telling example: In 2012, a blatantly anti-Semitic hashtag went viral in France and soon became the third-most trending topic on Twitter in the entire country. Following the threat of a lawsuit from anti-racist activists, Twitter took down all the offending tweets. In the years since, Jewish targets have been victimized by a wave of brutal and violent attacks. In retrospect, the viral anti-Semitic hashtag was a warning that was swept under the rug. Its popularity exposed France’s anti-Semitic underbelly and made it impossible to ignore, splashing the evidence inconveniently across the country’s social-media feeds—until it was made to disappear.

Now imagine that Twitter had implemented preemptive censorship protocols like those being urged on Facebook and had immediately squelched the hashtag with an anti-hate algorithm: The public at large would never have known about this outpouring of prejudice, leaving it free to propagate unchecked. Think about all the instances of bigotry by those in power—from the racist internet rants of police officers to the D.C. politician who posted a video claiming Jewish bankers control the weather—that we wouldn’t know about if Facebook had instantly censored them. Think of the lost opportunities to address and counter those sentiments.

Truly tackling the problem of hateful misinformation online requires rejecting the false choice between leaving it alone or censoring it outright. The real solution is one that has not been entertained by either Zuckerberg or his critics: counter-programming hateful or misleading speech with better speech.

How would this work in practice?

422,"ARSENAL are set to be lumped with Mesut Ozil for at least another six months with the unwanted German attracting no serious interest in the summer transfer market.

Taking home a pay packet of £350,000-a-week, Ozil is prime for a sale as the Gunners look to cut their wage bill for new signings.

However, the playmaker's shoddy form throughout the last campaign has led to zero formal approaches coming his way, according to Daily Mail.

Ozil registered just six goals and three assists last year having won a contract wrangle with the club, who handed him a mega three-and-a-half year renewal in January 2018.

Far from the only player to drop off as the going got tough, his poor displays contributed to Arsenal missing out on the Champions League - creating a double-edged sword.

In desperate need of improvements to his playing staff, coach Unai Emery has only around £45million to sign upgrades.

Therefore it is imperative the deadwood is shifted so that a centre-back, left-back and midfielder can be bought.

Saint-Etienne teenager William Saliba has been strongly linked with a switch but the Ligue 1 side want their defender loaned back to them for a season.

Another club playing hardball are Celtic, whose star full-back Kieran Tierney is subject to Gunners interest but his team are demanding £30m.

Arsenal are also reportedly keen to sell Shkodran Mustafi following his error-strewn campaign.

And yet, like Ozil, finding a buyer willing to pay his wages is proving difficult.",mainstream,M1b797,pizzagate
906,"US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday warned Internet firms to avoid offering the ""tools of oppression"" to authoritarian Middle East regimes trying to crush democracy protests.



Clinton urged private companies to ""embrace their role in protecting Internet freedom"" and ensure protection of ordinary people as well as political activists.



Speaking at an Internet conference in The Hague, the chief US diplomat cited cases where ""companies' products and services were used as tools of oppression,"" without naming the companies.



Companies have reportedly turned over sensitive information to governments about dissidents or shut down social networking accounts of activists involved in a political debate, she said.



""Today's news stories are about companies selling the hardware and software of repression to authoritarian governments,"" she told the Google-sponsored gathering.



""When companies sell surveillance equipment to the security agency of a Syria, or Iran, or in past times Gaddafi, there can be no doubt that it will be used to violate rights,"" she said.



Activists have used Facebook, Twitter and other Internet technology to organize protests against the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, and Libyan leader Moamer Gaddafi.



Assad has used deadly violence against protests since March, Ahmadinejad staged a lethal crackdown on protests following disputed elections two years ago, and Gaddafi was overthrown in August and eventually killed in October.



She said ""smart companies"" decide before being asked by their governments to avoid dealing with countries that use repression.



Clinton also warned against bids by repressive governments to use international fora to impose national barriers on the Internet by upending the public-private partnership now governing it.



""This approach would be disastrous for Internet freedom. More government control will further constrict what people in repressive environments can do online,"" Clinton said.



""It would also be disastrous for the Internet as a whole, because it would reduce the dynamism of the Internet for everyone,"" she said. 



Clinton aides said the comments referred to a Code of Conduct for Information Security that was introduced by Russia, China, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan at the UN General Assembly in September.



China's Internet controls have already become a key irritant in relations with the United States, especially after a dispute over Chinese censorship led US search engine giant Google to cut back in China. 



She said Washington supports the existing ""public-private collaboration"" that runs the Internet as it evolves in real-time, as well as the principles of multi-stakeholder Internet governance developed by the OECD this year. 



""A multi-stakeholder system brings together the best of governments, the private sector, and civil society. And it works,"" she said.

1234,"A California man has pleaded guilty to setting fire to the same Washington, DC, pizza place that was targeted by a man investigating a conspiracy theory that falsely connected 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to an alleged child sex trafficking ring under the restaurant.

Ryan Jaselskis, 23, an aspiring model, pleaded guilty Tuesday to arson and assault on a federal law enforcement officer.

He reached a deal with prosecutors in which he agreed to serve 48 months in prison, according to court records.

The judge isn't bound by the agreement.

Authorities said a small fire was started at Comet Ping Pong in DC on January 23 at about 9.20pm.

By the time DC Fire and EMS arrived at the scene, the pizza joint's employees had extinguished the fire that had spread to some of the curtains and window coverings inside.

Jaselskis admitted to setting the fire at the restaurant, which was occupied by children and adults at the time.

No injuries were reported and authorities haven't released a motive. Jaselskis' sentencing is set for March.

Weeks later, Jaselskis wrestled with a US Parks Police officer while being arrested at the Washington Monument after jumping a construction fence, police said.

He found himself in need of medical attention after he was tasered by the officer.

A firefighter, who treated him at the scene on February 4, recognized him as the man from Comet Ping Pong's surveillance images that authorities made public. The firefighter was able to identify Jaselskis due to his blue jacket.

Jaselskis was charged with unlawful entry and assaulting a police officer at that time and released from jail the next day.

That incident was captured by Cam Hasbrouck, who later uploaded the video to social media.

Jaselskis then returned to the Washington Monument hours after his release and again attempted to break in, only to be thwarted once again by US Park Police.

There was no resistance from Jaselkis during his second run-in with authorities, and he was later charged with unlawful entry, destruction of public property, and contempt in Superior Court.

The incident involving Jaselskis was not the first incident to occur at Comet Pizza in the wake of fake news reports claiming that is was a front for a child smuggling ring.

The unfounded 'pizzagate' conspiracy made headline news in December 2016 when Edgar Maddison Welch was arrested after he traveled to DC, went to Comet Ping Pong and fired multiple shots from his AR-15 assault rifle inside while demanding the truth about the conspiracy.

The conspiracy, which claimed that the restaurant sheltered a child sex abuse ring run by Hillary Clinton and her former campaign chief of staff, John Podesta, apparently originated on Twitter and led Welch, of Salisbury, North Carolina, to investigate the claims.

Welch later pleaded guilty to illegally transporting firearms over state lines and assault with a dangerous weapon.

There has been no evidence of the so-called abuse, no investigation and no victims who have come forward claiming to have suffered abuse. Welch was sentenced to four years in prison on June 22, 2017.",mainstream,M0cd6b,pizzagate
382,"In 2011, Donald Trump was interviewed on the phone by CNN’s Piers Morgan, who was working for CNN at the time.

Morgan asked for Trump’s thoughts on then-Congressman Anthony Weiner’s (D-NY) scandal, which was the first Weiner scandal (see “Weiner’s naked weiner hits the web”). There would be a second Anthony Weiner scandal in 2016 in the midst of the presidential campaign.

In the 2011 interview, Morgan asked Donald Trump what he thought about the Weiner scandal.

Trump said, beginning at the 0:26 mark in the video below, which was uploaded by CNN to YouTube on June 1, 2011:

I repeated that segment many times to make sure I correctly heard Trump say “pizzagate”. Did you also hear Trump say “pizzagate”?

As Alexandra Bruce of Forbidden Knowledge TV points out:

There was a WeinerGate in 2011 before there was a WeinerGate in 2016 – but as far as I know, there was no “PizzaGate” until 2016. Yet, Trump clearly uses the term “PizzaGate” here, in 2011! This is more than five years before this neologism entered the English vocabulary, as far as I know, with the revelations in WikiLeaks’ Podesta emails and in the Instagram posts of that pizza shop owner, who GQ Magazine mysteriously called the “49th most powerful” man in Washington, DC, which triggered an online citizens’ investigation into their possible relationships to pedophile ring operating in DC…. Mandela Effect? Pre-planned psyop? Or coincidental slip of the tongue?

Piers Morgan left CNN in 2014, which means the video of the interview could not have taken place after 2014.

Did élites-in-the-know like Donald Trump know about D. C. pedophilia years before the American people?

The answer is “yes” if we go by a tweet the late Andrew Breitbart posted on Feb. 4, 2011, in which he called John Podesta a “cover-upperer” for a “world class underage sex slave op[eration]”. (See “What Andrew Breitbart said about John Podesta”)

I am also reminded of what Joan Rivers wearily told a reporter two months before she died from a routine throat procedure: “We all know” Obama is gay and Michelle is a transgender.

But even if Trump had known about the D.C. pedophiles in 2011, why would he, in the CNN interview, say “I was watching between pizzagate and Anthony Weinergate”? Was Trump keeping tabs on the D.C. pedophiles way back in 2011?

700,"Have you ever struggled with the question of when it’s time to leave a relationship? Are you plagued with doubt about whether or not you will have made a mistake in breaking up with your partner and will suffer regret?

Sure, people often leave relationships too soon, before they have healed their own issues that they’ve brought to the “relationship system.”

If you choose to leave during a state of blaming your partner for your unhappiness, then you may take unhealthy patterns with you and re-create the same problems in your next relationship. Ending a relationship requires care, consideration, and questioning.

However, there are non-negotiable signs that it’s time to leave your partner. Here are three urgent indications that it’s time to end your relationship:

If you are in a physically abusive relationship, it’s time to leave. Period. Even if your partner agrees to get help, you need to leave until change actually occurs. Leaving the relationship will feel hard, but it is the right decision.

Even if your partner simply threatens physical abuse (but doesn’t act on it), you need to leave. Threats have the potential to be physically dangerous, and are emotionally abusive. You don’t want to put yourself in such a position to be manipulated.

If your partner is consistently verbally and emotionally abusive, this is another sign you need to leave. Verbal abuse can tear down your self-esteem, and that can have further, detrimental effects — both on your body and your mind.

It’s absolutely essential that you accept the fact that you have no control over whether or not your partner is abusive. You are not the cause.

If your partner has a personality disorder, such as Narcissistic Personality Disorder or Borderline Personality Disorder, and is not getting help, you may need to leave. It can be very painful to be at the other end of some of the behaviors of those dealing with a personality disorder.

Many people don’t know about what constitutes a personality disorder, even if they are familiar with some of the behaviors that might indicate a personality disorder. Expert Randi Kreger has referred to those with personality disorder as “high conflict persons.” They exhibit common behaviors — they tend to idealize you and then criticize you, project their emotions onto you, embarrass you, take advantage of you, demand things from you, lie to you.

It’s true that personality disorders can be healed with a lot of inner work. But it can be incredibly self-destructive to feel like you are waiting around others to improve themselves so your relationship can heal. You don’t deserve to sit around waiting while they continue to detract from your life by causing emotional destruction.

If your partner is an alcoholic, drug addict, gambler, sex addict, spending addict, or addicted to anything else that may be causing them, you, or anyone else harm or pain, you may need to leave — especially if they are not receiving help for the addiction.

Your partner may be able to deal with and overcome the addiction, but it might not be the right time for them to be investing in a relationship.

To get over an addiction, your partner will need to dedicate serious work toward personal growth, and it might be a struggle for him or her to put in the necessary work toward self-improvement, while also trying to be an attentive partner.

These three signs are some of the most common non-negotiable reasons to leave your relationship. Of course, a common — and very important — reason may simply be that you feel stuck and disconnected in your relationship. This may not be abuse. But it is a reason to leave.

For instance, if you are interested in personal growth and your partner has not been interested in changing at all, you might find that you have outgrown your partner. When you met each other, you both might have been abandoning yourselves in various ways, but through your personal growth, you might now be taking responsibility for yourself.

Leaving isn’t easy. Ask yourself, “Is leaving an act of self-care? Is there more for me to learn in this relationship, or can I best learn and grow outside of this relationship?” If you are honest with yourself, you will know the answers to these questions.

390,"The man who walked into Comet Ping Pong, a Washington, D.C., pizza shop, armed with an AR-15 assault weapon and a revolver to investigate internet rumors was sentenced to four years in prison Thursday.

Edgar Maddison Welch’s sentence is less than the 4 1/2 years prosecutors had requested, but much more than the 1 1/2 years Welch’s lawyers had pushed for.

Here’s a look at what led Welch to travel to the pizzeria and discharge his weapon.

A Twitter account purporting to belong to Jewish attorney David Goldberg — which Buzzfeed calls a “white supremacy” account — claimed that emails from former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s aide Huma Abedin “point to a pedophile ring” — with Clinton “at the center.”

The Twitter account has been suspended.

As the theories go, Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, were allegedly involved with the operations of an international child sex slavery ring. After the publication of hacked emails from Clinton’s campaign manager, John Podesta, the theory expanded to include him.

HOW AN INTERNET CONSPIRACY LED A GUNMAN INTO A PIZZA PARLOR

Theorists purported that Podesta’s emails contained code language known to pedophiles.

Podesta has exchanged some emails with pizzeria owner James Alefantis, who has fundraising ties with Podesta and other Democrats.

The “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory picked up steam on Reddit and other websites, Time reported. It has been widely debunked.

Even still, Alefantis told Fox News that he and his business were the targets of threatening messages — online and over the phone.

Welch walked into Comet Ping Pong armed with a knife, AR-15 assault weapon and a revolver. Welch said that he had driven to the pizzeria from Salisbury, N.C., in order to investigate online conspiracy theories of child sex slaves being held in the restaurant.

Welch fired his gun multiple times when he came upon a locked storage closet.

‘PIZZAGATE’ GUNMAN SAYS IN VIDEO HE’S STANDING UP FOR KIDS

After finding no children held against their will, Welch surrendered to police. He said “that he had read online that the Comet restaurant was harboring child sex slaves and that he wanted to see for himself if they were there,” according to the arrest affidavit.

“[Welch] stated that he was armed to help rescue them,” it said.

No one was injured in the shooting. However, a federal judge said Welch had “literally left psychological wreckage.”

The “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory eventually expanded to claim that Welch, the gunman, was really just a false-flag operation by the Clinton campaign to discredit Donald Trump, the president-elect at the time.

Welch pleaded guilty to interstate transportation of a firearm and assault with a dangerous weapon in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., the Associated Press reported.

In a letter filed with the court, Welch contended that his intent was never to harm anyone at Comet Ping Pong.

He said he ""came to D.C. with the intent of helping people I believed were in dire need of assistance, and to bring an end to a corruption that I truly felt was harming innocent lives.""

""It was never my intention to harm or frighten innocent lives, but I realize now just how foolish and reckless my decision was,"" Welch wrote.

A cell phone video Welch recorded on the way to the Washington, D.C., pizzeria was released. In the video, Welch told his daughters that he loves them as he drove.

""I can't let you grow up in a world that's so corrupt by evil without at least standing up for you, for other children just like you,"" he said.

Welch added that he wants to protect people who cannot protect themselves.",mainstream,M1177d,pizzagate
113,"Ryan Jaselskis, a California man accused of starting a fire inside the restaurant at the center of the baseless “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory, was ordered held without bond Thursday by a federal magistrate in Washington, D.C.

Mr. Jaselskis, 22, was arrested Wednesday over a minor fire started late last month inside Comet Ping Pong. He made his initial appearance the following day in D.C. federal court before Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey, who ordered him held pending the outcome of a detention hearing set for Tuesday, February 19.

Federal prosecutors believe Mr. Jaselskis is the same individual captured by Comet’s surveillance cameras setting fire to a curtain inside the restaurant on the night on January 23. Traffic cameras have placed a vehicle in his name near the scene of the crime that evening, and he was positively identified by an eyewitness who was at the restaurant at the time, according to court documents filed on behalf of federal prosecutors.

He is accused of “maliciously damage and destroy, or attempted to damage and destroy, by means of fire and explosive materials, the building and its interior contents,” Michael Pavero, an officer with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), wrote in a court filing Wednesday.

No one was injured as a result of the fire, and it was extinguished by employees and patrons prior to emergency personnel arriving, Mr. Pavero wrote in the filing.

Mr. Jaselskis was arrested by U.S. Park Police on Feb. 4 after allegedly hopping a security fence erected around the Washington Monument on the National Mall, the ATF officer wrote in the filing. He was subsequently charged, released and re-arrested the following day after allegedly jumping the same barrier, Mr. Pavero wrote in a criminal complaint and an accompanying statement of facts.

Mr. Jaselskis was wearing a distinctive blue, white and red jacket during both arrests that ATF investigators later matched to one worn by the arsonist, Mr. Pavero wrote. Additionally, the same 2007 Toyota Matrix registered to Mr. Jaselskis and seen near Comet on the night of the fire was ticketed by parking enforcement on Feb. 5, 6, and 7 near the Washington Monument, according to the ATF officer.

A public defender representing Mr. Jaselskis in the case did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

Mr. Jaselskis is at least the second person from outside of D.C. to face serious legal repercussions for incidents that unfolded at Comet Ping Pong since the unfounded “Pizzagate” conspiracy emerged in late 2016, which falsely supposes the restaurant is the hub for an underground human trafficking ring.

Edgar Maddison Welch was sentenced in 2017 to four years in prison after he pleaded guilty in connection with firing a rifle inside the restaurant. A resident of North Carolina, Welch previously said that he had traveled to D.C. to personally investigate the conspiracy.

861,"One year ago, a Democratic hangout across the river from Washington, D.C., cleared out early as dejected partisans suffered one of the most devastating, demoralizing nights in the history of their party.

They enjoyed a tasty anniversary at that same barbecue joint.

Area Democrats crowded it for a celebration of electoral dominance in several state races Tuesday, high-fiving, hollering and hoping that, just maybe, the Donald Trump-era Republican party is eminently beatable.

Television screens overhead showed Democrats in Virginia coasting to their biggest gubernatorial victory in decades; in New Jersey seizing a governorship; and winning numerous legislative seats, with one especially poignant twist: Virginia elected the first-ever transgender woman to a U.S. state legislature, and she happened to dislodge a previously invincible social conservative who wrote the state's anti-transgender bill.

Wilson left Pork Barrel BBQ early last Nov. 8 to take in what happened, on his own, at home: ""It was a rough night,"" said Wilson, the vice-mayor of Alexandria. ""I've lost elections myself. [Trump's election] last year was worse.... It was the pain you feel for the country. And the message it sent to my kids.""

His side couldn't beat Trump last year. But it rejoiced over the small blows dealt to Trumpism a year later, with results Tuesday that brought a sense of relief that the populist code might be crackable.

'We're coming out against Trump'

For the first time in a while, Democrats sounded confident.

Matt Bell ran 10 precincts Tuesday in Virginia and he couldn't believe the turnout. It's been almost three decades since Virginia state races hit 50 per cent turnout. Yet he saw an influx of people coming out in a cold driving rain, within the first minutes of polls opening in pro-Democrat areas near Washington.

""It was impressive. And it didn't let up... One guy told me, 'We're coming out against Trump,"" he said.

Democrats were sounding so nervous just hours earlier. A creeping sense of déjà vu was setting in.

Virginia in particular was cast a test case of the Trump model — with the idea that a Republican victory in this wealthy, purple, swing state might prove that the nationalist, populist, culture-warrior approach could win virtually everywhere in America.

A wealthy, big-city Republican once again cast himself as a conservative culture-warrior. Well-connected Washington lobbyist Ed Gillespie ran racially tinged messages about protecting Confederate statues, expelling Latino criminals, and football players not kneeling for the national anthem.

Democrats entered the race with a considerable lead — but like last year, the polls tightened in the final days.

Their message of economic-opportunity-for-all was swamped in sociological polemics. There was also fear of an enthusiasm gap on the left. Northam, a former army doctor who twice voted for George W. Bush, was scorned by some progressives. Morale wasn't helped by a new book that reawakened bitter memories from Wikileaks: the party's ex-chair wrote that Senators Bernie Sanders was cheated in last year's primary.

By late Tuesday, it was Republicans doing the second-guessing.

Anti-Trump Republican John Weaver, a former campaign aide to John Kasich, tweeted: ""GOP, you're seeing the future."" A like-minded colleague Rick Wilson tweeted his oft-repeated maxim: ""Everything Trump touches dies.""

The president was suddenly blaming the Virginia candidate — for not embracing him enough. This was an abrupt turn from earlier in the day, when Trump's Twitter feed was filled with get-out-the-vote message for Gillespie.

An area political scientist says it's probably wrong to treat this race between Northam and Gillespie as some kind of 2016 rematch holding great meaning about the imminent fate of American politics, since a whole bunch of other factors are at play, including 100 state legislative races happening simultaneously.

But people will do it anyway.

""The national media have tended to make this a referendum — a kind of Trump-Clinton redux: Here we are a year later,"" said Lauren Bell of Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Va.

""[If Republicans had won] the national takeaway [was] going to be that Trump was not a one-off. That he's not some cult-of-personality. That the way Republicans can win is by ... appealing to white voters' fears of a changing society.... The story [would] be, 'This is how Republican candidates can win.""'

At an event in Washington, D.C., a few days ago, former Barack Obama White House staffers expressed fear of a loss — and of its potential implications. If the racial-messaging tack were to prove successful in Virginia, they predicted it would alter the Republican party.

If it worked in a state with a thriving economy, a 3.7 per cent unemployment rate, a popular outgoing Democratic governor and a record of voting for Hillary Clinton last year, it would embolden Republicans to play the race card elsewhere.

""It has national implications,"" said Jon Lovett, a former Obama staffer

Poor results in 2013 races proved a harbinger of electoral doom ahead for Democrats — the party went on to lose both chambers of Congress, a century-old record 34 governorships, and the presidency.

But there are new slivers of light emerging for them.

University of Virginia political scientists have calculated that, even before Tuesday, Democrats had outperformed Hillary Clinton's 2016 margin in recent open-seat elections with an average gain of 11 percentage points.

843,"The gunman who fired an assault rifle inside the Washington DC restaurant at the heart of false allegations of a VIP child-sex ring has said he now regrets his actions.

“I just wanted to do some good and went about it the wrong way,” Edgar Welch, 28, told a reporter from the New York Times, adding: “I regret how I handled the situation.”

Welch was arrested on Sunday at the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria, which became the subject of lurid conspiracy theories after it was mentioned in the personal emails of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chief, published by WikiLeaks.

The controversy, which has been labelled Pizzagate, centres on references in the emails to Comet Ping Pong and to various types of food and other objects that online researchers have claimed are codewords for child sexual abuse.

Further investigations have thrown up a number of circumstantial links that self-appointed online detectives say indicate the existence of a network of powerful paedophiles. Accusations have been levelled against a number of senior Democrats, including Hillary Clinton and her husband Bill, the former president.

Those involved in the controversy deny all allegations of wrongdoing, and the speculation – which has taken place to a large extent on Twitter, YouTube and online forums such as Reddit – has widely been dismissed as another example of the so-called “fake news” phenomenon.

Meanwhile, a New York restaurant has become the latest target of conspiracy theorists. Roberta’s, a Brooklyn restaurant known for its wood-fired pizza, received telephone calls threatening its employees, police confirmed on Wednesday. There have been no arrests.

It was after reading online reports of the Pizzagate controversy that Welch, a father of two from Salisbury, North Carolina, woke up on Sunday, told his family he had some things to do, and got in his car for the 350-mile drive to Washington DC, the New York Times reported.

According to the paper’s interview Welch said he had wanted to give Comet Ping Pong a “closer look” to “shed some light” on the rumours before returning home.



Welch found no children held captive at the restaurant when he stormed in with his AR-15 rifle. However, although he admitted that “the intel on this wasn’t 100%”, Welch refused to disavow the claims he had read online.

He also said he did not like the term “fake news”, which he saw as a pejorative term that attempted to denigrate reports carried by alternative media. 



On Thursday, a judge delayed a preliminary hearing for Welch at the request of his public defender, who said she needed more time to investigate the case. One of Welch’s friends has told the Washington Post she did not think he intended to shoot anyone.

“He most likely really believes the conspiracy theory,” said Kathy Sue Holtorf, who lives in California and works as a film producer. “He’s a good guy with the best of intentions. He probably saw himself as more on a hero mission to save children than anything else.”",mainstream,M16534,pizzagate

If you try to visit either r/altright or r/alternativeright you are greeted with a message saying the community has been banned.

The closure seems to be in response to a ""proliferation of personal and confidential information"".

This suggests the thread was closed for ""doxing"" and not necessarily for hosting far right views.

Doxing is the term used for sharing an individual's personal information online, without their permission, so that others can harass them.

The Verge claims that details shared in this case were those of a man who punched a well-known far-right activist.

On Voat, an alternative Reddit style forum used by many of the same people, conversation threads back this theory.

Reddit said in a statement to Newsbeat it is ""very clear in the site terms of service that posting of personal information can get users banned from Reddit and we ask our communities not to post content that harasses or invites harassment.

""We have banned r/altright due to repeated violations of the terms of our content policy.""

It's not clear if the ban is temporary or permanent.

Both 'alt-right' and 'alternative right' groups have thousands of subscribers

According to cached copies of their pages these threads are followed by 15,000 and 200,000 people respectively.

But there are more popular right wing subreddits such as r/The_Donald, which has over 350,000 members - known as Centipedes, which are still running.

These forums have become a place where Trump supporters share views, some of them extreme right wing views.

There have been other Reddit controversies - remember #PizzaGate?

The ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy was a fake story which alleged that Hillary Clinton's campaign was involved in a child abuse ring operating from a pizza restaurant.

1151,"The conservative organizer who had planned a March on Google at nine locations nationwide this weekend put the event on hold Wednesday amid concerns that there could be violent clashes similar to the ones that roiled Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend.

Jack Posobiec, a far-right media figure who helped push the ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy theory, had played a lead role in organizing the March on Google as a way to protest the tech giant's decision to fire an employee earlier this month over an anti-diversity memo he penned and circulated.

“Google is a monopoly, and its [sic] abusing its power to silence dissent and manipulate election results,” Posobiec wrote for his blog marchongoogle.com. “Their company YouTube is censoring and silencing dissenting voices by creating ‘ghettos’ for videos questioning the dominant narrative. We will thus be Marching on Google!”

He encouraged people to peacefully protest in front of nine Google offices as a demonstration of their freedom of speech. Posobiec, a Trump supporter, also released a code of conduct for the march, which stated that it was not an ""alt-right"" event and that it was an “event for First Amendment supporters from across the country, from all backgrounds, ethnicity and walks of life.”

The term ""alt-right"" has become associated with white supremacy, white nationalism and the neo-Nazi movement.

In a marchongoogle.com blog post Sunday titled “March on Google Condemns Violence and Commits to Peaceful Rallies,” Posobiec said that anyone who incited violence would not be part of the event. The group, however, received threats of automobile violence mirroring the Charlottesville protests last weekend and therefore delayed its action.

“Following the articles, credible threats from known Alt Left terrorist groups have been reported to and relevant authorities have been notified,” Posobeic wrote Wednesday. “We look forward to the day when the human right of peaceful Free Speech is once again able to be practiced in America.”

Mountain View (Calif.) Police Department spokeswoman Katie Nelson would not disclose security details it had planned for the event, but said the department had received expressions of concern from the community over the past few days.

""We will continue to actively plan to provide an effective and appropriate police presence at the event and throughout the city, and we will be prepared to ensure a peaceful expression of everyone's First Amendment rights,"" Nelson said in a statement after the event was put on hold. ""We will do everything we can to ensure that everyone not only is able to peaceably protest, but that everyone is also safe.""",mainstream,M13147,pizzagate
1201,"Flying pizza, dives and unbeaten runs being broken. A decade and a half ago, Manchester United beat Arsenal 2-0 to prove that the Invincibles were, after all, vincible.

But what happened off the pitch afterwards is almost more famous than what happened on it.

Arsenal did not take kindly to losing their 49-game undefeated run. The two teams clashed in the tunnel.

For years, there was speculation over what happened next in what is now known as 'The Battle of the Buffet'. All that was ever confirmed was that a pizza flew through the air and landed straight on the face of Sir Alex Ferguson.

Ferguson wrote in his book: 'They say it was Cesc Fabregas who threw the pizza at me, but to this day I have no idea who the culprit is.'

Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown spent a few years hinting at the assailant, once commenting: 'From what I understand, it was a Spanish fella with great technique.

'Even when it came to the pizza he had great technique. He threw it like a Frisbee.'

Back in October 2017, Fabregas finally confirmed it was him: 'All of a sudden, I heard noises and I thought what's happening? So I go out with my slice of pizza and I saw Sol Campbell, Rio Ferdinand, Martin Keown (who wasn't actually there)... everyone pushing each other.

'I was like, I want to get in, but I don't know how to and I threw... peeew... just threw it. Once I saw it was hitting, like, who it was hitting, which I didn't mean...'

While he was able to joke about it two years ago, at the time the loss was a real blow for Arsenal.

They had established themselves as one of the greatest club sides ever the season prior, winning the title without losing a single match.

And this defeat really brought to an end the era of Arsenal being one of those teams who constantly challenged or won the Premier League. Having dominated the early part of the season, they soon fell apart.

They were also tremendously unfortunate to lose, which explains why emotions ran so high after the final whistle.

During the first-half, Rio Ferdinand should have been sent off after cleaning out Freddie Ljungberg with no one between the midfielder and Roy Carroll.

Dennis Bergkamp was also denied by Carroll, while Thierry Henry came close to putting his side ahead.

In the second-half, though, came the incident that defined the game. Wayne Rooney collected the ball on the right side of the box and went down while under pressure from Sol Campbell.

On closer inspection, there was very little, if any, contact from Campbell and Rooney seemed to be going down before he reached the England defender.

Mike Riley pointed to the spot. Campbell was aghast. Ruud van Nistelrooy put the penalty away. The armour had clearly been pierced.

Arsene Wenger said: 'I think we were a little bit robbed. I didn't think there was any contact at all.

'I'm very disappointed because we were the better side. We had lots of chances but the referee's decision made the difference. From nowhere, Riley has decided the game.'

Ashley Cole nearly equalised late on for Arsenal but it would not be their day. Instead, Louis Saha and Alan Smith worked the ball well between them before setting up Rooney to finish off a counter-attacking sweep up the field.

After the game, Wenger accused Van Nistelrooy of cheating after fouling Cole in an incident the referee did not spot, which led to Ferguson telling him to control his players.

That sparked the pizza throwing. While that has always been the moment of note, Arsenal equipment manager Paul Johnson was also left with a bloodied nose while a security guard at Old Trafford was caught in the face.

Henry ended up confronting television reporters because they gave Ferdinand the man of the match award despite his clear foul on Ljungberg earlier in the game.

Arsenal never really recovered from the game and within a month found themselves five points behind Chelsea, who won the title for the first time under Jose Mourinho.

The incident did not pass quickly. Ferguson would hammer Wenger in January 2005 for not saying sorry for accusing his side of cheating: 'It's a disgrace, but I don't expect Wenger to ever apologise, he's that type of person.'

He later added: 'It seemed to me that losing the game scrambled Arsene's brain.'

Wenger fired back and said Ferguson was guilty of 'bringing the game into disrepute'. Getting the two to tone down their language required an intervention from the Sports Minister Richard Caborn and Premier League chairman Richard Scudamore after the police asked them to get involved.

The legacy of the game was so long-lasting that it took until 2009 for the pair to be on speaking terms again. In the decade that has passed since, the issue has clearly passed.

303,"Tests could reveal whether we are part of a giant computer simulation — but the real question is if we want to know…

In the 1999 sci-fi film classic The Matrix, the protagonist, Neo, is stunned to see people defying the laws of physics, running up walls and vanishing suddenly. These superhuman violations of the rules of the universe are possible because, unbeknownst to him, Neo’s consciousness is embedded in the Matrix, a virtual-reality simulation created by sentient machines.

The action really begins when Neo is given a fateful choice: Take the blue pill and return to his oblivious, virtual existence, or take the red pill to learn the truth about the Matrix and find out “how deep the rabbit hole goes.”

Physicists can now offer us the same choice, the ability to test whether we live in our own virtual Matrix, by studying radiation from space. As fanciful as it sounds, some philosophers have long argued that we’re actually more likely to be artificial intelligences trapped in a fake universe than we are organic minds in the “real” one.

But if that were true, the very laws of physics that allow us to devise such reality-checking technology may have little to do with the fundamental rules that govern the meta-universe inhabited by our simulators. To us, these programmers would be gods, able to twist reality on a whim.

So should we say yes to the offer to take the red pill and learn the truth — or are the implications too disturbing?

The first serious attempt to find the truth about our universe came in 2001, when an effort to calculate the resources needed for a universe-size simulation made the prospect seem impossible.

Seth Lloyd, a quantum-mechanical engineer at MIT, estimated the number of “computer operations” our universe has performed since the Big Bang — basically, every event that has ever happened. To repeat them, and generate a perfect facsimile of reality down to the last atom, would take more energy than the universe has.

But others soon realized that making an imperfect copy of the universe that’s just good enough to fool its inhabitants would take far less computational power. In such a makeshift cosmos, the fine details of the microscopic world and the farthest stars might only be filled in by the programmers on the rare occasions that people study them with scientific equipment. As soon as no one was looking, they’d simply vanish.

In theory, we’d never detect these disappearing features, however, because each time the simulators noticed we were observing them again, they’d sketch them back in.

That realization makes creating virtual universes eerily possible, even for us. Today’s supercomputers already crudely model the early universe, simulating how infant galaxies grew and changed. Given the rapid technological advances we’ve witnessed over past decades — your cell phone has more processing power than NASA’s computers had during the moon landings — it’s not a huge leap to imagine that such simulations will eventually encompass intelligent life.

“We may be able to fit humans into our simulation boxes within a century,” says Silas Beane, a nuclear physicist at the University of Washington in Seattle. Beane develops simulations that re-create how elementary protons and neutrons joined together to form ever larger atoms in our young universe.

Legislation and social mores could soon be all that keeps us from creating a universe of artificial, but still feeling, humans — but our tech-savvy descendants may find the power to play God too tempting to resist.

They could create a plethora of pet universes, vastly outnumbering the real cosmos. This thought led philosopher Nick Bostrom at the University of Oxford to conclude in 2003 that it makes more sense to bet that we’re delusional silicon-based artificial intelligences in one of these many forgeries, rather than carbon-based organisms in the genuine universe. Since there seemed no way to tell the difference between the two possibilities, however, bookmakers did not have to lose sleep working out the precise odds.

That changed in 2007 when John D. Barrow, professor of mathematical sciences at Cambridge University, suggested that an imperfect simulation of reality would contain detectable glitches. Just like your computer, the universe’s operating system would need updates to keep working.

As the simulation degrades, Barrow suggested, we might see aspects of nature that are supposed to be static — such as the speed of light or the fine-structure constant that describes the strength of the electromagnetic force — inexplicably drift from their “constant” values.

Last year, Beane and colleagues suggested a more concrete test of the simulation hypothesis. Most physicists assume that space is smooth and extends out infinitely. But physicists modeling the early universe cannot easily re-create a perfectly smooth background to house their atoms, stars and galaxies. Instead, they build up their simulated space from a lattice, or grid, just as television images are made up from multiple pixels.

The team calculated that the motion of particles within their simulation, and thus their energy, is related to the distance between the points of the lattice: the smaller the grid size, the higher the energy particles can have. That means that if our universe is a simulation, we’ll observe a maximum energy amount for the fastest particles. And as it happens, astronomers have noticed that cosmic rays, high-speed particles that originate in far-flung galaxies, always arrive at Earth with a specific maximum energy of about 1020 electron volts.

The simulation’s lattice has another observable effect that astronomers could pick up. If space is continuous, then there is no underlying grid that guides the direction of cosmic rays — they should come in from every direction equally. If we live in a simulation based on a lattice, however, the team has calculated that we wouldn’t see this even distribution. If physicists do see an uneven distribution, it would be a tough result to explain if the cosmos were real.

Astronomers need much more cosmic ray data to answer this one way or another. For Beane, either outcome would be fine. “Learning we live in a simulation would make no more difference to my life than believing that the universe was seeded at the Big Bang,” he says. But that’s because Beane imagines the simulators as driven purely to understand the cosmos, with no desire to interfere with their simulations.

Unfortunately, our almighty simulators may instead have programmed us into a universe-size reality show — and are capable of manipulating the rules of the game, purely for their entertainment. In that case, maybe our best strategy is to lead lives that amuse our audience, in the hope that our simulator-gods will resurrect us in the afterlife of next-generation simulations.

The weird consequences would not end there. Our simulators may be simulations themselves — just one rabbit hole within a linked series, each with different fundamental physical laws. “If we’re indeed a simulation, then that would be a logical possibility, that what we’re measuring aren’t really the laws of nature, they’re some sort of attempt at some sort of artificial law that the simulators have come up with. That’s a depressing thought!” says Beane.

This cosmic ray test may help reveal whether we are just lines of code in an artificial Matrix, where the established rules of physics may be bent, or even broken. But if learning that truth means accepting that you may never know for sure what’s real — including yourself — would you want to know?

363,"The Mainstream Media reported earlier this month on an intelligence bulletin released by the FBI’s Phoenix office back in May alleging that a connection exists between so-called “conspiracy theories” and domestic terrorism, and while there have veritably been some people who hold such controversially defined beliefs and then ended up killing others, it’s anti-American to suspect that people who don’t believe the official narrative about various events automatically qualify as potential terrorists.

The de-facto criminalization of free speech is an ongoing trend in American society that’s already pressured a lot of people to self-censor their beliefs in public in order to avoid official scrutiny from the authorities or harassment by their political opponents, but an intelligence bulletin released by the FBI’s Phoenix office back in May and only reported on by the Mainstream Media earlier this month might spread the dragnet even further by de-facto criminalizing the online pursuit of additional information that contradicts the official narrative about various events.

The “secret police” (as they’d be described by the Mainstream Media if any other country’s version of the FBI was being reported on) believe that a connection exists between so-called “conspiracy theories” and domestic terrorism, and while there have veritably been some people who hold such controversially defined beliefs and ended up killing others, it’s anti-American to suspect that anyone engaged in seeking out all sides of every story (no matter how possibly implausible) automatically qualifies as a potential terrorist.

Appendix B of the document says that

The examples given for each category are “NWO”, “UN”, and “False Flags”; Zionist Occupied Government” and “Islamberg”; and “Pizzagate” and “QAnon”, respectively, followed by a very brief description of each one. What’s so dangerous about these categorizations is that some of them are broad enough to be applicable to practically anyone who’s skeptical about recent events, which in turn could put these individuals on terrorist watch lists and possibly even result in restrictions on their civil liberties, such as their right to exercise the Second Amendment if so-called “red flag laws” are applicable in their state and Big Tech companies inform the authorities that someone was researching or discussing such unofficial narratives online.

For instance, the FBI describes the “NWO” “conspiracy theory” as asserting that “a group of international elites controls governments, industry, and media organizations, instigates major wars, carries out secret staged events, and manipulates economies with the goal of establishing global rule”, which basically summarizes the modus operandi of the American-led neoliberal system.

By the Bureau’s own definition, anti-war dissidents who expressed their belief that the US’ 2003 War on Iraq was launched on the media-driven manufactured pretext of non-existent “Weapons of Mass Destruction” in order to advance American influence in the tri-continental geopivotal and energy-rich region of the Mideast would be classified as “conspiracy theorists” who would then be suspected of being at risk of committing “domestic terrorism”. That so-called “conspiracy theory”, however, has since been vindicated as “conspiracy fact”, though in the contemporary context, those tarred and feathered as “conspiracy theorists” for believing modern-day analogues such as the US and its allies manufacturing fake pretexts to “contain” Russia, China, and Iran might soon be seen as unofficial enemies of the state.

For another perfect example of just how potentially all-encompassing the FBI’s alleged “conspiracy theorist”-terrorist connection is, one need look no further than its description of the “UN” “conspiracy”, which it describes as asserting that “the UN is being used by an evil global cabal to erode American sovereignty, strip away individual liberties, and bring foreign troops to American soil in order to replace democracy with global tyranny.”

None other than the sitting US President himself has publicly questioned the UN’s role in eroding American sovereignty, as have most of his supporters, yet the FBI’s bulletin classifies that belief as a “conspiracy theory” that could potentially indicate a “terrorist” in the making. Many more such examples could be shared about how the “secret police” could easily use the Phoenix office’s definition of “conspiracy theories” to “justify” unethical surveillance of domestic targets for political reasons, which is anti-American to the core even though it’s taken for granted that this is already going on to an uncertain extent. If “red flag laws” are expanded nationwide, then Trump’s own supporters might find themselves forcibly disarmed just for agreeing with him.

The Democrats should be concerned too because they might also find themselves on government watch lists as “conspiracy theorists” just like their rival Republicans if they simply go to the “wrong” website that questions official narratives. That could potentially be Russian international media like RT or even independent/ alternative American online outlets, it just depends on how “conspiracy theories” are defined by internet service providers, which sites they “flag” as “suspicious”, and whether or not the user is being tracked by cookies to link them to that page.

Democrats might not worry too much about having their Second Amendment rights restricted through “red flag laws”, but they could come under other forms of targeted state harassment as well on a selective basis dependent on the “secret police’s” subjective whims. It’s for these reasons that opposition to the FBI’s de-facto criminalization of online research (which builds upon the already de-facto criminalized expression of free speech in many instances) should be a bipartisan issue because it goes against everything that the US purports to stand for.

109,"In appearance, Trump’s April 6, 2017 missile attack on Syria is the first step towards a regime change, a massive regional conquest, and World War 3. In appearance, the event marked a point of no return for Trump’s presidency.

We have entered uncharted territory, with the future of humanity at stake.

Murder in the name of propaganda

What is clear is that the chemical attack was a false flag operation, staged for war propaganda purposes, with intelligence operatives, the Deep State, the political elite, and the corporate media working in unison.

Syrian jets hit a rebel position. Chemicals used by the rebels (US-backed terrorists, CIA) were stockpiled at the target. The target was hit.

Out of this came the fabricated narrative that President Assad released a chemical weapons attack on civilians, despite the Syrian government having no sane political reason to do so. The Assad regime had recently been given assurances by the Trump administration and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson suggesting that a regime change was not in the Trump administration’s plans, and that “the Syrian people would decide” Assad’s fate. There was also no sane reason for Russia to have participated in or condoned a chemical weapons attack on civilians.

Syrian-Russian anti-terror operations were succeeding, and Putin was looking forward to cooperation with the new Trump administration.

The White Helmets (left), who play a starring role in the subsequently staged “humanitarian crisis” spectacle, are US/UK-backed terrorist/intelligence assets and propaganda agents.

All signs point to a setup using tired old tricks. A repeat of previous similar staged “humanitarian crisis” pretexts, from the “incubator babies” to “Aleppo Boy”. Elements of the current #SyriaHoax includes clumsy staging of the “chemical attack”, starring a doctor who is a known US-backed terrorist, dead and injured people laughing (because they don’t think the cameras are running), actors playing “dead children” opening their eyes. The Twitter page of a fabricated 7-year old Syrian girl Alabed Bana is ridiculous propaganda that is promoted by major Fake News media, including Jake Tapper of CIA-connected CNN.

As Ron Paul and many others warned, the propaganda must be questioned. According to the sources of former CIA operative Ray McGovern and numerous other current and former intelligence officers, the White House was extensively briefed, and CIA director Mike Pompeo “played it straight”. Trump “knew”, or should have known, “was persuaded”, and ordered the missile strike anyway.

National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Defense Secretary Mattis (image right) pushed for the strike. White House advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump reportedly also pushed for the strike. White House advisor Steve Bannon advised against the strike, and was rebuked.

Who ordered this operation to frame Assad?

Was it the Deep State and corrupt players, and the unhinged warmonger and Al-Qaeda/ISIS favorite John McCain, who visited Syria in February?

Was it to force the Trump administration to act?

Was it the Trump administration itself, setting up a multi-pronged deception?

Was it conducted by other forces or governments (Israel, etc.)?

What did Russia know, if anything? Who benefits?

Trump fired 59 Tomahawk missiles on Shayrat air base. Trump continued entertaining Chinese president Xi Jinping in Palm Beach while the operation unfolded. Nine civilians were killed in the attack and several more were wounded.

Donald Trump committed a mass murder, and is now officially a war criminal. What is also a fact is that the strike and the resulting narrative politically benefits terrorism— ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and the CIA— in opposition to Syria, Russia and their allies, who are fighting terrorism. It was also a glorious moment for the Deep State and the New World Order.

Both Russia and Syria were warned in advance. No Russians lost their lives. Only 23 missiles hit their mark (why and where did the others go?) The damage was “relatively minor”. The runway was left intact. Syrian military planes were able to conduct sorties from the same runway against rebel targets the following morning.

In his statement following the attack, Trump spoke of the “slow and brutal death of beautiful babies, cruelly murdered in a barbaric act”, and declared that there was no question of Assad’s guilt. He left no room even for investigations or questions. Tillerson, former head of Exxon-Mobil (and major player in past wars in which Exxon-Mobil benefited greatly) stated that there will be “no role for (Assad) to govern the Syrian people”, and “there was no doubt Assad was behind the chemical attack”. Defense Secretary Mattis also declared “no doubt” that Assad did it.Trump also stated that his attitude towards Assad “has changed very much” due to the alleged chemical attack. And to further exacerbate tensions, the Pentagon was ordered to begin an investigation into Russia’s role behind the chemical attack.

Was Trump’s attack “real”—or a one-time fake retaliation, in response to a fake chemical attack? Was Trump acting on his own, or was he deceived or forced to order the retaliatory strike? Was Trump naïve and ignorant enough to be manipulated by the Deep State propaganda, and act recklessly out of emotion?

Or was he playing a game?

The world remains confused about the attack and its meaning. Even more baffling is Trump’s apparent total reversal of principle.

According to former State Department counterterrorism coordinator Daniel Benjamin, Trump has

Why did Trump take what appears to be a sudden and unwarranted step towards regime change in Syria, globalism, and World War 3 confrontation with Russia. Why, after having won the presidency for advocating the opposite?

Why this, from the anti-globalist/anti-regime change/anti-corruption choice was (unlike the deeply corrupt neocon-backed war-loving Hillary Clinton and her network) believed to be the president who would start World War 3?

Why this, from someone who knows he won the election because the vast majority of American voters who responded to the message that “Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo”?

Why this, from a man who lambasted the Obama administration for meddling in Syria, and said attacking Syria was a bad idea at least 45 times? Why this, following months of insistence—over the violent opposition of the Deep State, Obama/Clinton Democrats, the Fake News corporate Media and endless “Russiagate” noise— that cooperation with Russia was critical to Middle East stability and world peace? Trump and his administration are now leading the anti-Russia and anti-Putin propaganda effort, launching daily attacks at Putin via the corporate media.

Why this, mere days since Rex Tillerson stated that Assad’s future would be decided by the Syrians, and regime change was not planned?

The missile attack on Syria sparked immediate outrage from the largely anti-war Trump base, which denounced the strikes as a gigantic betrayal.

Most of the leading alternative media voices supporting Trump are, and remain, staunchly anti-war, including Mike Cernovich, Paul Joseph Watson, Stefan Molyneux, Jack Posobiec, Lee Stranahan, and many others. Some are ready to “get off the Trump train”. Even Trump’s blindest followers are going into contortions coming up with rationalizations.

Richard Spencer condemned Trump for his betrayal, and organized an anti-war rally in front of the White House. (This rally was violently attacked by pro-war Soros-funded Antifa thugs.)

Adding to the confusion is the fact that the Trump presidency, despite being embattled, was winning on many fronts. Much had been, up until April 6, moving in his favor.
• The Deep State’s all-out war on Trump was being met with effective pushback from those in the Trump camp. Simultaneously, the Deep State is being fought independently by whistleblowers, including WikiLeaks.
• “Russiagate” is backfiring. Attention has been turned toObama/Democrats illegally spying on Trump and private citizens, leaks, and numerous corruption scandals possibly implicating current and former Democrats and Republicans.
• Investigations into Hillary Clinton, the Clinton Foundation, the Obama administration, and the Democratic National Committee remain open and ongoing, with the FBI and the Justice Department sitting on thousands of pieces of incriminating evidence.
• Large numbers of human trafficking and pedophilia arrests are taking place nationwide, under the direction of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, towards the exposure of the larger pedophilia network and political blackmail apparatus that controls much of Washington (Pedogate/Pizzagate).
• The destructive activities of Antifa and anarchist groups funded and controlled by neoliberals and Democrats aligned with Clinton and Obama have failed to turn public opinion against Trump.
• The intelligence-controlledestablishment corporate media aligned against Trump is losing on all fronts to independent and social media sources, and is now derided as Fake News.
• Trump’s presidency is a guiding example inspiring anti-globalist nationalist movements around the world, supported by Nigel Farageand the forces behind Brexit, and nationalists such as Marine Le Pen in France. These movements are gaining momentum.
• Many elements of his Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) agenda are being put into place, despite obstruction and violent opposition by adversaries.
• Most importantly, Trump had been fully supported by his base, through every difficulty.

Does it make any sense for Trump to squander these gains and alienate his vital support base? Why did he suddenly do the one thing that would lead to his demise: an act of war that only a globalist neocon of the highest order would pull off; the one thing that can unite both Left and Right against him?

Why does it seem that Trump is abandoning MAGA altogether?

Why would he toss away an alliance with Russia that would have ensured, if not at least contributed greatly, to a true world peace?

We are left with speculation.

In this interpretation, Trump has given up the fight against globalism. He has “been flipped”. He has sold out. He has surrendered to intimidation from the Deep State.

The Syrian false flag was set up by the Deep State, and Trump was ordered to finish the war of conquest begun with 9/11, or face consequences. He was threatened into doing exactly what Hillary Clinton wants done. Forced to abandon principles. Forced to commit political suicide. Forced to abandon his base, and accept being a politically isolated, impeachable lame duck president. The Trump presidency is left to collapse from both external attack and internal undermining. The Deep State triumphs, and the Bush/Clinton criminal network gets the last laugh.

A variation on the theory: Trump has cut a deal to end the civil war that has grown too damaging, threatening the existence to the system itself. Both the Deep State and Trump prefer to end the fight.

In exchange for the allowing the war to take place, Trump will be lavished with the rewards of all of the corrupt White House puppets who preceded him, as long as he follows orders. If he does a good job, he will be the next ceremonial “war president”. He will get some of his domestic agenda passed, be permitted to live, be treated “normally” by the media, and ride off into the sunset. But MAGA, and the “swamp draining” of Flynn, Bannon, etc. is over.

What appears to be the White House’s sudden“shift to the center” smacks of this capitulation.

Is Trump in danger, is he in control, or is he an isolated dupe?

In explosive new stories broken by Mike Cernovich, national security adviser H.R. McMaster, acolyte of disgraced former CIA Director David Petraeus, has taken over the National Security Council, and is manipulating intelligence reports to Trump and wants 150,000 ground troops in Syria. McMaster is plotting with Petraeus to is purging all who oppose a ground war in Syria.

In this consolidation of power, Trump loyalist K.T. McFarland has been removed. Sebastian Gorka may be next to be removed by McMaster.

McMaster is also close with scandalized former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice, and it is reported that Rice herself pushed McMaster to remove Steve Bannon from the NSC. Bannon, who is against regime change, is gone.

Petraeus himself was considered by Trump for the NSC post, following the ouster of Michael Flynn by the Deep State, before McMaster got the job.

In the words of Cernovich, it is now “Trump supporters out, pro-war Petraeus puppets in”.

These disturbing new developments, and the McMaster takeover of foreign policy, come in the wake of months of White House infiltration and sabotage.

Despite continuous warnings of Trump loyalists for the past months, Trump chose to surround himself with enemies and those who seek to undermine his original agenda: Republican/Bush neocons, Obama/Clinton infiltrators (“West Wing Democrats”), Deep State operatives, globalists, Goldman Sachs denizens. He has filled the “swamp” more than he has “drained” it.

In the internal civil war between Trump loyalists and the globalists, the Trump loyalists appear to be losing, leaving Trump isolated and surrounded by seasoned criminals, saboteurs, and spies. National security adviser Flynn, the most powerful operational member of what was the inner circle, was effectively forced to resign, perhaps not coincidentally after spearheading operations against the Deep State. The influence of advisor Steve Bannon, leading force behind the anti-globalist/anti-establishment agenda, has been greatly diminished, and there were rumors that he has considered leaving the White House.

Meanwhile, the influence and power of the CIA/Clinton/Obama/Soros/Goldman Sachs/Israel-connected “West Wing Democrats”–Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, Gary Cohn, and Dina Powell is on the rise. Poisonous Bush neocons such as Vice President Mike Pence and Reince Priebus, and the neocon generals, remain securely in place. Trump has shown no signs thathe will fire family members, despite Kushner’s questionable background, and regardless of his leaks of anti-Bannon stories to MSNBC. Hecontinues to praise Priebus, despite evidence of sabotage, and despite thefact that the recently fired Priebus aide Katie Walsh was caught leaking anti-Trump stories to the enemy Fake News media.

Now comes word that the Trump presidency is “reset” towards a “centrist” globalist platform and the end of MAGA; the end of the “deconstruction” and reform efforts represented by Bannon.

According to former CIA operative Robert David Steele, this is Trump’s “Bay of Pigs” moment, in which Trump either reverses course and opposes the Deep State forces pressuring and manipulating him, or he gives in to them—thus rendering himself an immediate lame duck president. This is the moment in which Trump must take on his enemies, at risk to his life. Or not.

Here is the “optimistic” scenario.

Was the missile strike itself a limited one-time staged propaganda deception—a fake response to a fake chemical attack— done with the back channel cooperation of the Russians and Syrians, who were warned in advance? The fact that no Russians were killed, “relatively minor” collateral damage was done, and the runway was left intact all suggest this possibility.

It was a noisy show of military strength and resolve—professional wrestling-style theater—to pave the way for Rex Tillerson’s April 11, 2017 diplomatic trip to Russia, which will focus on the Syrian crisis. It was also a symbolic “shock and awe” gesture , to impress and intimidate visiting Chinese president Xi Jinping, a message to North Korea, and future US-China relations, including tensions in the South China Sea and US-Chinese trade.

The provocative noise is a planetary game of “chicken”—“peace through strength”, “don’t mess with us”—will improve US advantage in negotiations, and ultimately result in future victory. There will be tensions, but no world war. According to Mattis, “tensions with Russia will not spiral out of control”.

This version of events is embraced by Steve Pieczenik, as well as Alex Jones and Roger Stone. Stone does not believe that the limited strike signals the beginning of a wider war. But both Jones and Stone agree that if Trump does widen the war, “he is done”, and Trump “becomes George W. Bush”, and “part of the Bush-Clinton-Bush-Obama continuum”.

Numerous other possible “4-D chess” scenarios are put forth by Scott Adams. This is the mythical Trump, keeping allies and foes alike off balance, many steps ahead.

It was also a “wag the dog” distraction, designed to erase Russiagate from news headlines (he has now “proven” that he is not “buddy buddy with Putin”), quell the media, temporarily quell the political opposition, and rally heretofore skeptical world leaders.

Trump also benefits from a “Bush Iraq-9/11 moment”, and becomes a “war president”, avenging an atrocity committed by an evildoer. Even if he loses the support of much of his base, perhaps Trump believes that it can be replaced by new support from those who might warm to him “in a time of war”, against current boogeyman Assad.

Jack Posobiec speculates that Trump and Putin might have cut some sort of back channel deal.

Wikileaks’ Julian Assange wonders that if the end game is that Russia pulls out of Syria, the quagmire will be left for the other nations.

Would Russia to go along with the removal of Assad, along with a carving up of Syria that includes Russia?

Is Trump, in fact, a neocon globalist, in the long line of neocon globalists (Bush-Clinton-Bush-Obama/Clinton), who is now casting aside his populism, because it is no longer useful? Is Trump controlled by higher elites?

Has Trump been lying to the Russians and Putin for months about cooperation, while preparing major military moves against them? Has Trump used the Russians to get rid of ISIS elements, while plotting to get rid of the Russians once they stop being useful?

Is Trump, in fact, out to prove that he can outmuscle the “weak” Obama/Clinton globalist agenda, and do them one better, by 1) actually conquering Syria, 2) beat Russia and China, and drive them out of the Middle East, 3) take the Grand Chessboard, and also 4) scare China in compliance? Is this the “peace through strength” total war that Trump and his generals envision?

Trump is also a fervent militarist, who “loves generals” and loves the idea of wielding American military muscle and supremacy. This is evidenced by his incessant fawning overtures to Pentagon and CIA, and surrounding himself with generals and warriors. He is genuinely a fan of the intelligence community and law enforcement. As it probably pains him that any factions within these institutions oppose him, he is eager to win them over.

Trump has never stopped accusing the Obama/Clinton regime of “weakness”. The Trump foreign policy will therefore display“strength”.

Trump must certainly know that war is insanely lucrative, and an economic multiplier that could boost a stagnant US economy. He is pushing a huge increase in military spending.

Who benefits from regime change in Syria? Who benefits from confrontation with Russia and world war 3? None other than the Deep State, the CIA and the New World Order.

There is also the oil. And the pipelines and transit routes.

How could Trump and oil man Tillerson ignore the Grand Chessboard and its spoils?

Judging by the latest provocations, the Trump administration is foaming at the mouth for war:

AP: Senior US official says US has concluded that Russia knew in advance of chemical attack

US forces on Jordanian border, standing by with Jordanian special forces

Trump discussed with king of Jordan Sunni/Kurd coalition to stabilize Syria

Russia warns Trump they will respond with force if Syria red lines crossed again

Boris Johnson spearheads diplomatic drive to get Russian forces out of Syria

UN ambassador Nikki Haley: getting Assad out not only priority in Syria

Tillerson: no role for Assad in Syria

In statements given during April 9 press interviews, Tillerson repeated that defeating the Islamic State remains the top focus, and the strike has “not changed US priorities towards ousting Assad”. Haley repeated declared that regime change in Syria is a priority and “inevitable”. McMaster promised that fighting ISIS and ousting Assad are “simultaneous”, and did not rule out additional strikes.

On every front, severe damage is quickly being done to US-Russian relations, too much to be forgiven or easily reversed. There are few voices of reason, and none from within the Trump administration.

Secretary of State Tillerson makes the Trump administration’s first official trip to Russia on April 11. (If a state of war exists between the US and Russia, would Tillerson be making this trip at all?)

The result of this negotiation could decide the fate of humanity.

But is it smoke and mirrors? Is it all a moot point now?

US military forces are ready. According to Jack Posobiec’s well-placed sources in the military, there will be boots on the ground June 1 or earlier.",conspiracy,C03e9e,pizzagate
115,"Traditional news outlets have endured hardships for a while now. The rise of web publishing and free content started undermining once beloved magazines and newspapers decades ago now. And those left standing are forced to experiment with new business models and sustain the whims of the social media platforms that now hold news organizations’ fate in their hands.

But this last year in American media has been rougher than most. The election inspired more than the usual amount of tribalism online, and citizens’ trust in traditional media fell to an all-time low: just 32 percent told Gallup they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media. This lack of trust formed the perfect petri dish in which a plague of misinformation could fester and bloom.

Along came the fake news stories and hyper-partisan websites that were more than happy to publish unrecognizable hyperbole and all-out lies. The stories didn’t have to be true—the public had already lost faith in the fact-checkers—they just had to confirm a certain subset of people’s existing beliefs. And if they did, people would share them. The more people shared them, the more Facebook would reward their publishers by prioritizing them in users’ news feeds. By August, one Buzzfeed analysis showed, fake news was increasingly outperforming the top stories at the 19 major news outlets.

It’s little wonder then, that in this brave new world, a candidate like Donald Trump could become president. While mainstream media outlets, fact-checking organizations, and Hillary Clinton’s team worked diligently to correct his frequent fibs, Trump’s supporters were being treated to a completely different narrative about the man—and the woman he was running against—in their social media feeds.

But it wasn’t just these new media platforms—and yes, Facebook is one—that faced an existential crisis. It was happening on television, too. From the moment Trump took that fated escalator ride down to the lobby of Trump Tower to announce his bid for the presidency in July 2015, cable news networks like CNN and MSNBC kept their cameras locked on Trump. By September, he had received 10 times as many mentions on major television networks as Dr. Ben Carson, his nearest rival for time on-air. By the end of the race, Trump had been mentioned on television 1.26 million times, twice as many times as Hillary Clinton.

As CBS chairman Les Moonves said at the time (and presumably came to regret), Trump’s overexposure “may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS.”

Once it was clear Trump had become a serious contender for the White House, these same networks tried in vain to fact-check him in the moment, with many a viral chyron at the bottom of the screen. “Trump: I Never Said Japan Should Have Nukes (He Did).” read one. “Trump’s Son: Father Apologized to Khans (He Hasn’t).” A valiant effort, but for those who hadn’t already changed the channel, it seems like further confirmation that the media, as Trump often alleged, had it out for him.

The feeling of futility didn’t end there. As media distrust festered, the man who would become president-elect was building a media outlet of his own. On Twitter, he issued major announcements—and major disses—turning his feed into both a competitor and a source for other reporters. On Facebook, he expanded his following with an aggressive digital advertising campaign that helped win him the White House. Who needed a web full of think pieces when voters could get frequent and fervent updates on Trump direct from the source?

Which brings us to December. Trump is still tweeting and working hard to further undermine trust in the press. The press is simultaneously trying to decide when a tweet from the soon-to-be president constitutes breaking news and when it should be written off as a rant. Mark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, is finally coming around to the idea that maybe, just maybe, Facebook has more influence on people’s political beliefs than he initially believed. Recently, he announced hoax news sites will no longer be able to advertise on Facebook and that the company is rolling out verification, reporting, and detection tools to make it easier to spot false stories.

It’s a start, but after a truly grueling year for the media industry, the hardest part is yet to come. If 2016 was about dismantling institutions of every shape and size, 2017 will have to be about picking up the pieces and figuring out where to put them now.",mainstream,M0de2e,pizzagate
638,"Out in the leafy suburbs of Woodland Hills, California, in an OK house in an OK neighborhood, the actor Corey Feldman is wandering around, saying he soon might name the name of the man he says raped his like-a-brother best friend and frequent co-star, the late Corey Haim, back in 1985. He’s been talking about naming this name for more than seven years now. But each time, Feldman has shied away at the last minute, citing lawsuit fears, further ostracism and derailment of a career already off the tracks, and possible physical harm to him and his family.

He sucks on a nicotine-filled vape, exhales a plume, drops his head a little and says, “I mean, I’ve had my life threatened twice in the last six months.”

His wife of two years, a tall blonde named Courtney, nods. “People want to kill him. They don’t want what he has to say to come out.”

“I can tell you that the number-one problem in Hollywood was and is . . . pedophilia,” Feldman says, as he often has. “That’s the biggest problem for children in this industry. It’s the big secret.”

One possible, obvious reason for the keeping and hiding of this big secret: No one really wants to hear about children and rape if it involves the nation’s number-one source of escapist entertainment. In 2013, Feldman went on The View to talk about how the pedophile numbers are larger than anybody knows and include a ring reaching up into the Hollywood elite that’s been shielded for years by the establishment. Barbara Walters looked at him with disbelief, hands clasped across her belly, and snarled, “You’re damaging an entire industry,” as if to say that Hollywood itself was more valuable than the wrecked lives of a few youngsters.

And then there’s HBO’s Leaving Neverland, in which two men allege that Michael Jackson, who was one of Feldman’s closest friends growing up, abused them when they were kids. Feldman has always said Jackson never touched him inappropriately, and at times he seemed to be defending Jackson against accusers. After watching the first half of the documentary, he tweeted, “This whole thing is 1 sided w no chance of a defense from a dead man, & no evidence other than the word of 2 men who as adults defended him in court.” This led to a barrage of criticism on social media, however, and, a few days later, a clarification from Feldman, who went on CNN to say, “I cannot in good conscience defend anyone who’s being accused of such horrendous crimes. But at the same time, I’m also not here to judge him, because, again, he didn’t do those things to me and that was not my experience.”

“I watched it with my wife and son,” he says now. “It caused me to have concerns. It’s the standard grooming process that they describe. Everything was similar [to what happened to me] up until the sexual part. Everything. He bought me gifts, a Watchman TV, a gold watch from Disneyland. So was he grooming me and I just never ended up being his pick? Or was that just who he was? That’s the fucking thing. We’ll never know. But I would have been exactly his type. I was cute, short and blond. You know?”

About what allegedly happened to Corey Haim, though, Feldman has no doubts. “Not one,” he says — much to the unending dismay of Haim’s mother, Judy, who says her son was never raped by anyone and that Feldman is saying it happened only be cause he’s still jealous of her boy’s success, and that he’s using Haim’s name to scam the public out of crowd-funded money for a movie about industry pedophiles that’ll never get made.

“He’s desperately trying to destroy my son’s history, his image, his memory,” says Haim. “It’s a very deep jealousy thing, that my son always got first billing. I’m sick of him, dragging my son’s name through the mud for nine years. I mean, how shameful. The guy’s a liar. The guy’s sick. OK?”

To combat Feldman, she and her supporters, and there are quite a few of them, have formed an online gang that’s come to be known as the Wolfpack. They produce YouTube videos with titles like “You Lowlife Feldman You Have Gone Too Far This Time” and send out tweets saying, “If longing to see @Corey_Feldman get gang raped in prison is wrong, I don’t want to be right,” and “I personally will never stop until CF is in prison or mental institution at best.”

Right now, Feldman is standing in his living room, while a bunch of recent arrivals busy themselves unpacking cameras, monitors and light-reflecting umbrellas. He’s 47 but doesn’t look much different than the impish, thin-lipped, wisecracking kid who became one of the mid-1980s’ most bankable teen faces, in still-beloved movies like The Goonies, Stand by Me and The Lost Boys. And when he smiles, you can still see that kid in there, somewhere, but you also see a poster boy for the age-old perils of teen stardom, and a story that turned tragic for his pal Haim, who died in 2010, at the age of 38, from complications arising from pneumonia after a lifetime spent struggling against the various addictions that Feldman says he himself managed to kick for good in 1995.

Walking through the foyer into a back room (video-game machine, jukebox, dartboard, vibrating easy chair), he’s still thinking about the Wolfpack.

“They’re plotting against me,” he says. “There’s been an assault charge pending against me, a labor-board charge, things that are ruining my life. They’re trying to get my kid taken away. All this is what I’m up against. These are the stakes. I am fighting for my life. But I’m tired of being victimized and blackmailed. That’s why I’m fighting back.”

Which is what the film crew is about. He’s producing a documentary titled Truth: The Rape of Two Coreys, about the two industry men who allegedly molested him at the age of 14 and about the A-lister and others who allegedly raped or molested his best friend. “We’ve got about seven [people] who were told firsthand that this person raped Corey,” Feldman says, “and they’re all being interviewed.”

Feldman’s going to sit before the cameras, too, to talk about what he claims Haim told him on the day they first met, when both were 14, and Haim was trying to convince Feldman, a virgin at the time, that they should mess around, that “this is what all boys do. It’s called the boys’ club, and this is totally normal” — all words that Haim said he’d once been told. Feldman asked by whom. Haim told him, and, according to Feldman, went on to describe his alleged rape in ugly, explicit detail. Says Feldman, “When a kid tells you something as a way to arouse you — when he’s sitting there with a hard-on, trying to hook up with a guy — you don’t immediately go, ‘Where’d this come from?’ It wasn’t like he just was, ‘Hey, man, you know what happened to me?’ But the line he used, ‘I’m not gay, but I was taught this by other guys in the business’ — how do you question that?”

According to Feldman, Haim swore him to secrecy, only to reconsider 23 years later and beg Feldman to tell his story should he die first. “Nobody knows what it feels like to constantly console somebody whose life has been ruined by rape.” Feldman says today, “unless you’ve been there, holding them when they cry, bringing them back to life over and over, stopping them from walking around with a knife.”

He pauses, then continues, “I didn’t ask for this. I didn’t ask to tell his story. I didn’t ask for any of it.”

If ever there was an imperfect messenger for attempting to take down pedophiles in Hollywood, Feldman might be it. He has an untidy past that can’t help but follow him everywhere and a present that seems to do him no favors either. By the time he was 19, he’d been arrested three times for heroin. He liked coke, too, along with weed, mushrooms, alcohol, crack, Quaaludes and acid. Then, during his post-youth-star decline, he started settling for insta-flop movies like Meatballs 4 (1992), Lipstick Camera (1994) and Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV (2000). By that time, he’d been clean for five years, but Hollywood had already written him off, except when it wanted to make him look like an idiot, as it did on the WB reality series The Surreal Life, in 2003, and Celebrity Wife Swap, in 2015.

“I’m never going to escape it,” he once said, morosely.

Left to his own devices, however, Feldman does stuff that is ill-considered at best and often just plain weird. Earlier this decade, he used to throw parties at his house (“the Feldmansion”) featuring a gaggle of girls called Corey’s Angels, which regular Joes could attend for $250, with the hot-tub experience going for $500 and the cabana for $2,500. Vice reported on two of them and made them look like thoroughly unappealing, sparsely attended, grisly affairs. Then there’s his lunatic 2016 performance of a song called “Go 4 It” on the Today show. As usual, his all-girl backup band, the self-same Corey’s Angels, sported wings and halos. Feldman himself wore some kind of bizarre pitch-black monk’s hood and danced this fitfully spasmodic, histrionic thingamajiggy, complete with twerking. It went viral, with an explosion of Twitter-led ridicule that was so brutal Feldman felt called upon to post a video response.

“We did the best that we could,” he said. “And, like, I’ve never had such mean things said about me…. Public shaming should not be accepted, no matter who you are.” And then he wept.

So, clearly he may never be able to display the gravitas of, say, Ashley Judd, who helped kickstart the MeToo movement. Nor does he have much in the way of industry clout. But he’s nothing if not dogged in his pursuit of ways to get his message out, even though, so far, it’s been one disappointment after another. He wanted to name names in his 2013 memoir, Coreyography, but the publisher, St. Martin’s Press, nixed the idea, for obvious legal reasons. He hoped for better with Lifetime’s 2018 biopic, A Tale of Two Coreys, but again events were sanitized. Looking for independence, he decided to crowd-fund his own feature film, $10 million being his goal, saying it would “literally change the entertainment system as we know it,” but it was branded a scam and fell apart at the $273,000 mark. The main complaint: that it looked like he wanted the $10 million as a reward for naming names. His response: To name names when the statute of limitations is long gone is to invite lawsuits stretching to the horizon.

For all that, he’s looking pretty good these days. He usually presents himself noon-ish — since bedtime is usually three-ish — clean-shaven and spruce, favoring pegged jodhpurs, clunky tennis shoes and a baseball cap worn backward — and, if he’s going out, in one of his pants pockets, a Taser, “one of the hardcore ones,” he says, meaningfully. Seems you can never be too careful. Last year, despite the presence of a mammoth security guard named Jeff, Feldman was allegedly attacked in his car by a hoodlum who ripped open the door and, he says, plunged something like a needle into his abdomen, injecting Lord knows what, which led to an emergency-room visit, lots of snickering from social media doubting Thomases who thought he’d pulled a hoax, and the addition of bentonite clay to some of his health shakes, to hopefully siphon off any new toxins in his system. The police seemed to have viewed whatever happened as a random road-rage incident, while Feldman continues to maintain it was a directed attack, though even he acknowledged that, at worst, he ended up with “the world’s smallest knife wound.”

Also, sometimes he’ll hide a tiny video camera somewhere on his body and record conversations with those he’s unsure of. He’s a little paranoid like that, perhaps not unreasonably so. As he says, “People constantly break your trust and use it against you. It’s very emotionally battering. I’m an intelligent person, but there’s something about me that’s very naive. I don’t understand a lot of the world still. But I am trying to get better at protecting myself.”

His cellphone beeps. He reads a text, groans, shakes his head and says, “What the fuck. Shit. Goddamn it.”

As of a few days ago, he had about 10 people willing to go before the cameras and tell what Haim had told them about his alleged rape. Feldman was psyched. Finally, it wouldn’t just be him speaking out. “Holy jackpot,” he said. “We’re fucking gold!”

But one by one they’ve been thinking twice. This latest backpedaler gave as a reason receiving a death threat on Twitter. “Corey, I feel terrible that I’m disappointing you,” she texted him. “I’m not being a flake, I’m just simply very frightened.”

Feldman rolls his eyes and snorts. “Oh, well, then, yeah, I totally understand backing out of your obligations. Like, what am I doing this all for if nobody is going to stand with me? That’s what made the Weinstein situation work. Everybody stood together!”

At the moment, lots of things do seem to be going sour. The Wolfpack, in particular, seems to have gotten under his skin. They call him “numb nuts” and predict he will soon die “from suicide or drug overdose.” They talk of blitzed-out sex orgies at the Feldmansion. They are constantly churning out YouTube videos and podcasts — mostly made by a self-proclaimed activist named Bobby Wolfe, hence the Wolfpack name — that make him look like a sicko at best. They come up with unsubstantiated allegations that almost instantly get trumpeted around the internet as fact and use them to try to, for instance, get Child USA to drop Feldman as one of its ambassadors or else they’ll call for a boycott on donations. It goes on and on, and Feldman sees the hand of Judy Haim guiding it all.

One day last summer, he dropped by the office of one of his lawyers, Perry Wander, who’s also represented Lindsay Lohan and Warren Beatty, and started talking about the Wolfpack.

“There’s an entire conspiracy that’s been formed of at least 30 people who are working under the guidance of her,” Feldman said. “Look, it’s a group of people put together by one person.”

That’s his latest theory: Judy Haim was paid to put together an anti-Feldman cabal and ruin him. (“This is the most ludicrous thing I’ve ever heard,” says Judy Haim.)

Wander sighed and said, “No. They’re put together by a woman who is protecting her son’s memory.”

“By saying he was never raped, which is a lie,” Feldman said. “How does that protect his legacy, anyhow? The legacy is the kid shows up on drugs all the time. The kid got fired all the time. The kid was seen as the train wreck of Hollywood. How does explaining to people why he was that way ruin his legacy? It’s the exact opposite. It shows people it wasn’t his fault. He was a victim and screwed up in the head because of what happened to him. And that’s why he would wake up in the ICU.”

Wander leaned forward. “I don’t think there’s a deeper grief than a parent losing a child, and I can see how a woman grieving over that loss could go overboard. Personally, I think you ought to take the high road and say, ‘This is a mother grieving.’ ”

Feldman’s eyes widened. “She’s trying to have my kid taken away! They’re making false assault charges against me. They’re trying to say I drugged girls and molested them. [Judy Haim denies it all.] Trying to ruin my marriage. She’s trying to make Corey Feldman look like a liar! Like a bad guy! When actually I’m a morally upstanding citizen who has never done anything to anyone.”

Later, on the street, Feldman shook his head and said, “I don’t think Perry understands the scope of what I’m dealing with.”

And sometimes it seems like Feldman doesn’t really understand the scope of what he’s dealing with either. Or the degree to which he seems obsessed. Or how odd it sounds when he talks about himself in the third person. But onward he plows.

In their prime, after The Lost Boys partnered them up, in 1987, he and Haim became known nationwide as the Two Coreys. They cruised in black limos together, hung out together at Alphy’s Soda Pop Club (for underage industry kids), snorted coke together, appeared in each other’s movies, had sex with each other’s girlfriends (or at least Haim did), saw their movie paydays plummet out of the stratosphere, sold CD collections on street corners for drugs (or at least Feldman did), and started a hot­line for kids, with Haim sometimes giving advice about drugs while bombed. A young Claire Danes once dialed in.

Even so, they got into spats, most often over Haim’s continued drug use once Feldman cleaned himself up in 1995, and they didn’t see each other for months at a time. They reunited for a final time in 2008, for the Two Coreys reality show on Lifetime. Anything went except for one thing: the abuse they suffered as kids. But on the first episode of the second season, Haim let it rip about a hanger-on named Dominick Brascia. “You let me get fucked around in my life, man,” he hissed at Feldman. “Raped, so to speak, when I was about 14 and a half, and I’m saying this right now, by the guy you still hang out with, and [you] tell me, I’m 14 and a half, to take responsibility. You know exactly what I’m talking about. What’d you do, man, when you saw that going down when I was 14? You knew about it. Besides being his best friend. What’d you do? Fuck-all is what you did, man. Lines of cocaine with me. God bless you.”

Feldman looked blindsided and didn’t even try to rebut Haim’s accusations. How could he? He did introduce Haim to Brascia. (Brascia denied the allegation and died in 2018.) And he didn’t do anything once he knew what happened. And he did bring coke into Haim’s life, along with acid and heroin. But he was 14 too — a peer, not a parent.

“At the end of the day, how are these things another kid’s fault?” Feldman says now. “How is it a 14-year-old’s job to raise another 14-year-old? I was growing up myself. He was left unsupervised in a world of sleaze­balls. He was an innocent child, I was an innocent child, and it was our parents’ job to protect us from the adult world.” And they didn’t, quite obviously.

Feldman grew up in Woodland Hills, a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley. His father was a half-baked musician and mostly absent. According to Coreyography, his former-Playboy-Club-Bunny mother, Sheila, on the other hand, viewed her son as her own personal meal ticket after he was cast in a McDonald’s ad at age three. Soon enough, according to his memoir, he’d appeared in more than 100 commercials and 50 TV shows, with his mother force-feeding him diet pills to keep his weight down and beating him with a fist if he messed up on set. (His mother has denied it all.)

Then, starting when he was 14, came the alleged sexual abuse. First guy was an assistant, a small-time actor named Jon Grissom, who was hired by his father and who did prison time for child molestation in 2003. Feldman says the abuse went on for more than a year. He also claims, as he confirmed on The Dr. Oz Show, that the guy who ran the Soda Pop Club, Alphy Hoffman, molested him. (Grissom and Hoffman could not be reached for comment.)

“These men were circling around me,” Feldman says. “Me and my best friend were surrounded, being tossed back and forth between them without our knowledge, and it was just horrendous. . . . [Abuse] involves conditioning a child and grooming them and getting them ready for the days that they’re going to be molested. It involves putting people in place to make sure a kid is surrounded by only pedophiles.”

“It was the gossip back in the Eighties,” former Little House on the Prairie star Alison Arngrim once remembered. “People said, ‘Oh, yeah, the Coreys, everyone’s had them.’ People talked about it like it was not a big deal. . . . I literally heard that they were ‘passed around.’ The word was that they were given drugs and being used for sex. It was awful — these were kids. . . . There were all sorts of stories about everyone . . . that these two had been sexually abused.”

Some three decades later, however, Feldman’s claiming that the names he will soon reveal are or have been of Hollywood movers and shakers, A-listers and influencers, studio heads and the like, and that his revelations “can literally change the entertainment system as we know it, and I believe that I can also bring down potentially a pedophile ring that I’ve been aware of since I was a child. Right off the bat, I can name six names, one of them who is still very powerful today. [It’s] a story that links all the way up to a studio [and] connects pedophilia to one of the major studios.” The abusers on his list, however, are small-potato has-beens and hanger-ons, and the one big guy isn’t that big anymore.

This doesn’t mean that studio heavies couldn’t be involved in one way or another. According to Matthew Valentinas, an entertainment lawyer who co-produced the astounding and oddly ignored 2015 documentary about Hollywood pedophiles, An Open Secret, “They exist. They are there. There is no doubt about it.”

The idea of protecting child actors does get a lot of lip service in Hollywood these days. Take the 2012 California state law called the Child Performer Protection Act. It requires publicists, managers, acting coaches and head-shot photographers who work with child actors to be fingerprinted and have their names entered into a searchable database, but it’s not really enforced and never has been.

As a result, more kids are being put at risk than otherwise might be, with more victims being left to deal with the repercussions. The average age of coming to grips with childhood molestation and being ready to talk about it? According to Child USA, it’s 52.

At home, his wife, Courtney, is in the kitchen, juicing blood oranges and preparing lunch for the crew and her husband, who is falling deep into a moment of despair. He knows how Hollywood works, especially when it comes to anything that might disrupt business.

“What am I doing this for? So that everybody can ignore me, so that everybody in Hollywood can once again turn their backs on me and laugh at me and go ha-ha-ha? We need to prove that there is an orchestrated movement to silence me.”

“Maybe Hollywood realizes that they kicked me to the curb for nothing,” Feldman says. “And hopefully they embrace what I’m doing and say about that other guy, ‘You know what? This is a big sore at the bottom of our leg and we need to just amputate.’ Or they could go, ‘Well, we see all of the evidence, and, you know, screw you.’ Once this is out, I’m assuming millions of people are gonna see it. It’s gonna be everywhere, you know, no matter what happens.”

He looks around, like he’s waiting for someone to agree with him about this rosy scenario in which ultimately, probably, at least in his mind, he is restored to some semblance of his former teen-movie-star glory.

About six months later, Truth: The Rape of Two Coreys is almost done, with Feldman still making the rounds looking for a distribution deal and an infusion of cash so he and his cameras can afford to go confront Judy Haim in Canada and take on Corey Haim’s alleged rapist in Los Angeles, to give them a chance to respond to the movie’s charges.

His initial big hope had been Netflix; he talked to people there in early December. Pass. In mid-January, he went to Sundance and talked up Truth. Again, nothing. Later that month, he spoke with Lifetime, which did the 2018 Two Coreys movie, as well as the recent documentary Surviving R. Kelly. But no deal. “The fact that they passed was shocking,” Feldman says.

Meanwhile, he also says he’s getting poorer by the minute. “It’s fucking scary,” he says. “But at the same time, I have faith. I have faith that I’m supposed to complete my mission.” And what about the Wolfpack? “All they’re really doing is protecting a pedophile, and once the film comes out, they’re going to look just as foolish as all those rabid Michael Jackson fans who sit there and, you know, yell and scream and curse at people that say he might be guilty.”

He insists it’s only a matter of days until a deal gets made. He’s been saying that for months now, however. It could happen, of course. Feldman’s a persistent guy. He’s not going to give up. But no matter his intentions or his words, or if, in fact, the public ever has a chance to see his movie, it does seem like a fight that, for him, may never and will never actually come to an end.

Editor’s note: After this story was published, a Feldman representative told Rolling Stone: “Corey just signed a deal with a company who is financing finishing touches of production and will be handling worldwide distribution. It is projected that the release of the film will take place in the fourth quarter of this year.”",mainstream,M0cb19,pizzagate
163,"As social media executives and policy makers puzzle over how to respond to the most recent upsurge of fake news, they occupy well-trod historical ground. The dilemmas around how to define deceptive speech and how to check rank duplicity bedevil every modern capitalist society.

Past efforts suggest both key actions to consider and some cautions about how hard the task will be.

The most effective approach depends on a combination of meaningful self-regulation by the business community, innovative fraud policing and the willingness of political leaders and media elites to stand up for truthful public communication. At the moment, perhaps because of the extent to which Americans have come to disagree about what counts as “truth,” each of these requirements seems in short supply.

Anti-fraud efforts have an especially rich history in the United States, connecting such disparate topics as adulterated fertilizers, bogus patent medicines, and fly-by-night mail order firms, endemic investment swindles and bait-and-switch consumer advertising, and, more recently, telemarketing scams and misleading sales pitches for debt products like residential mortgages.

Every generation, Americans relearn that deceptive business practices not only harm investors and consumers, but also hurt honest firms and undermine broader economic confidence. What then to do about it?

One recurring impulse has been to deny the worst liars access to the marketplace. After the Civil War, the American Post Office Department invented the fraud order, which tackled the problem of deceptive long-distance marketing by denying allegedly duplicitous firms access to the mails. In the early 20th century, the new network of Better Business Bureaus began to circulate suggestions to newspapers and magazines that ads from especially dodgy marketers were “not in the public interest.” More recently, the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have collaborated on Operation Chokepoint, which has denied sellers of bogus goods and services access to the online payment system.

The problem of fake news has prompted analogous countermeasures, this time implemented by social media companies like Facebook FB, and Google GOOG, GOOGL, . These companies have banned the producers of phony news accounts from using their online advertising services.

Efforts to cast out commercial fabricators from the marketplace have the big advantage of immediate, quick impact. But America’s history of anti-fraud regulation suggests important limitations as well. There is the whack-a-mole problem, since cheats and deceivers often respond to fraud orders and similar tactics by relaunching businesses under different names.

Such summary modes of dispensing justice also clash with American commitments to the rule of law, and so prompt complaints about exercises of raw power that seem more consistent with autocratic regimes. Faced with such critiques, most anti-fraud agencies eventually create procedural protections against unfair treatment: notice of impending bans from access to the marketplace, access to incriminating evidence and an opportunity to mount a defense through formal hearings.

The resulting reforms (in the 1910s and 1920s for mail fraud orders, in the 1950s and 1960s for Better Business Bureau recommendations that media outlets shun specific advertisers) made anti-fraud enforcement fairer. But they did so at the cost of slowing down enforcement actions and diminishing their effects.

The history of American anti-fraud policing suggests there is no magic bullet to the endemic problem of deception in the marketplace or the public square. Criminal prosecutions of the worst offenders can make a difference, though constitutional protections for free speech and the global reach of the internet complicate this potential means of curbing fake news.

Well-conceived public education may be even more important, whether undertaken by government agencies, NGOs or the media. Another emerging strategy to curb bogus news emphasizes this approach. The idea is to rely on crowdsourced tagging on social media of stories as “disputed,” along with work by journalistic gatekeepers to adjudicate such allegations.

Read:The next conversation about fake news needs to be this one

As this example suggests, we will never escape the need to invest trusted arbiters with the authority to label some deceptive practices as illicit. And unless we are willing to tolerate draconian regulatory actions, we will never banish duplicity entirely from our economic or political life.

Our best option is to tailor laws and design institutions with the goal of containing fakery and fraud, an objective that depends as much on the operation of social norms and shaming techniques as it does on formal penalties and the cultivation of savvier consumers of products, investment pitches and news.

This approach is far from perfect. But it can limit the impact of deceitful speech, and so the corrosive threats to our economy and our democracy.

354,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A North Carolina man pleaded guilty on Friday to opening fire in a Washington pizzeria that fake news reports claimed housed a child sex ring linked to 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Edgar Welch, 28, of Salisbury, was accused of firing at least three shots from an AR-15 rifle inside the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in December and pointing the gun at an employee after showing up to investigate the online conspiracy rumors. No one was hurt.

Welch pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to a federal charge of interstate transportation of a firearm with intent to commit an offense and a local charge of assault with a dangerous weapon.

Welch, dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit, said little more than “Yes, ma’am” in response to questions from Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. Asked what he wanted to do, he said, “Plead guilty.”

He could face up to two years in prison on the federal charge and a maximum five years for the assault charge. Jackson scheduled sentencing for June 22.

Welch also faces potential fines and must pay restitution for damage to a computer, door lock and a ping pong table at the restaurant.

A local firearms charge was dropped as part of Welch’s plea. He also carried a loaded .38-caliber revolver into the pizzeria, and police found a loaded shotgun in his car, according to court documents.

Welch told police he was investigating a bogus conspiracy theory known as “pizzagate.” Posts to social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and the Reddit online message board falsely claimed Comet was the center of a child sex ring run by Clinton and her campaign chairman, John Podesta.

The claims were part of a proliferation of false news reports during the U.S. presidential election campaign, often disseminated through websites purporting to be news outlets and quoting bogus sources.

Scott Talan, a communications professor at Washington’s American University, said Welch was an example of how mistrust of traditional news sources and of authorities’ ability to investigate suspected crimes could prompt vigilante-style behavior.

762,"Forty years ago this week, Roman Polanski went from being one of the most celebrated film-makers in the world to becoming the United States’ most notorious fugitive from justice.

On 1 February 1978, after 42 days in jail, Polanski fled the US while awaiting final sentencing, having pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. On these facts, everyone agrees. There are no hazy conspiracy theories – we know exactly what happened because Polanski admitted to it and later wrote about it in astonishing detail in his autobiography, Roman by Polanski, published six years after he left the US and went to France, where he still lives. There are some quibbles about who said what, but the generally agreed facts are as follows: in March 1977 Polanski, who was then 43, took a child, Samantha Gailey (now Geimer), who he knew was 13 years old, to Jack Nicholson’s house to take photos of her for a magazine. There, he gave her champagne and, according to her, quaaludes. He then had sex with her, drove her home and, the next day, was arrested.

The facts have never altered. What has changed is how this case is discussed in the public sphere. For a long time, the simple – and somewhat simplistic - divide was that while people in mainland Europe viewed Polanski as a tragic artist undone by US prurience and corruption, Americans saw him, as he put it in his autobiography, as “an evil, profligate dwarf”. But, in truth, for many British and US actors, working with Polanski never lost its cachet, and arguably had even more once he became excluded from the US mainstream. Sigourney Weaver, Harrison Ford, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor, Pierce Brosnan, Kate Winslet and many more have appeared in Polanski movies in the decades since his conviction, and questions about why they were working with a convicted child rapist were seen as tacky, proof of a rigid mind more focused on gossip than art. When Winslet was asked last September whether she had any qualms about working with Woody Allen, another director accused (but, unlike Polanski, never arrested and never charged) of a sex crime against a minor, she replied: “Having thought it all through, you put it to one side and just work with the person. Woody Allen is an incredible director. So is Roman Polanski. I had an extraordinary working experience with both of those men, and that’s the truth.”



When the Harvey Weinstein story broke last October, the reaction among the movie industry was wide-eyed shock that someone so many of them knew and worked with could be a rapist. “I didn’t know. I don’t tacitly approve of rape,” said Meryl Streep. And yet only a decade and a half earlier, Streep had stood and applauded when Polanski won best director at the 2003 Oscars, not so much tacitly approving rape as explicitly celebrating a convicted child rapist. If only anyone had known about Weinstein they would never – never! – have worked with him, movie insiders say. And yet, for the past 40 years, many of them have been falling over themselves to work with a self-confessed child rapist, even defending him by pointing to his artistic credentials. Debra Winger described Polanski’s arrest in Switzerland in 2009 as a “philistine collusion”. Reactions to Weinstein come soundtracked with the distinct sound of bandwagon-jumping; thanks to the #MeToo campaign, the public mood is firmly on the side of listening to victims, and Hollywood has keenly followed suit. On Sunday night, at the London Critics Circle awards, only months after defending Polanski and Allen, Winslet spoke tearfully about “bitter regrets I have at poor decisions to work with individuals with whom I wish I had not. Sexual abuse is a crime, it lies with all of us to listen to the smallest of voices.” Yes, if only there had been some way Winslet could have known about these decades-old cases before signing on to work with two directors accused of sex crimes! This kind of hypocrisy about Polanski makes you wonder how serious the industry really is about dealing with this problem, as it claims to be.

By the beginning of this century, while the general American public remained firmly set against Polanski, the mood in Hollywood was openly in his favour. There was that applause from Hollywood luminaries when he won the 2003 Oscar (Polanski, of course, did not attend the ceremony, as he was still officially on the lam). In 2008, film-maker Marina Zenovich caught the mood and pushed it further with her documentary, the queasily titled Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired, which argued that Polanski was the victim of gross judicial misconduct during his case. (In one of those ironies we can only appreciate in retrospect, this documentary, which presents an energetic case for the defence of a sex offender, was produced by the Weinstein Company.)

Zenovich’s movie focuses on how Polanski had the misfortune to come up in front of Judge Lawrence Rittenband, who was obsessed with self-publicity and determined to make an example of Polanski. Rittenband was thought to be considering sentencing him to 50 years in prison, which was when Polanski fled. Much emphasis is made in the movie about how Polanski’s celebrity hurt him during the trial, which is true. But Zenovich does not mention how it also helped him. Polanski was originally indicted on six counts of criminal behaviour, to which he pleaded not guilty. But Gailey became so frightened by the attention the case attracted, because of Polanski’s fame, she tried to withdraw from it entirely. As a result, her attorney arranged the plea bargain, in which five of the charges were dropped and Polanski pleaded guilty to statutory rape, which was the least serious charge against him.

Like all arguments in Polanski’s defence, the documentary stresses the previous tragedies in his life: his mother, four months’ pregnant, was killed in the Holocaust; his wife, eight months’ pregnant, was brutally murdered by the Manson family. But one can have enormous sympathy for those losses, and also feel that offering up dead women as mitigating factors for raping a girl doesn’t really wash.

I wrote about the documentary for this paper when it came out, as it struck me as astonishingly exculpatory. After all, no matter how badly the legal system failed Polanski, this didn’t cancel out the fact that he raped a child. But I was, it turned out, grossly out of step with the times. Readers, acquaintances and even friends couldn’t tell me enough how wrong I’d got it. By now, celebrities were falling over themselves to defend Polanski. He hadn’t committed “rape-rape,” Whoopi Goldberg said on TV. “Very clearly, and he’s proven this, Roman Polanski is not a predator,” Johnny Depp said, apparently unaware of the child-rape issue. When Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in 2009, where he was jailed for two months and then put under house arrest (the house, in this case, being a chalet in the Alps), Debra Winger claimed “the whole art world suffers”. A petition demanding his release was signed by more than 100 actors and film-makers, including Emma Thompson (who later asked to have her name removed), Yasmina Reza and Tilda Swinton. Harvey Weinstein wrote an open letter in his support, in which he claimed: “Whatever you think of his so-called crime, Polanski has served his time.” Supporting Polanski became like owning a Prius: something any fashionable, well-heeled liberal should do.

Well, eight years is a long time in sexual mores. Weinstein is now firmly banished and actors are apologising for appearing in Woody Allen movies. And yet Polanski’s name is mentioned only sporadically, even though he is the only one with an actual conviction. Moreover, more allegations have been made against him: in 2010, British actor Charlotte Lewis said Polanski abused her in 1983 when she was 16. Last year, four more allegations emerged: former US actor Mallory Millett said Polanski tried to rape her in 1970; German actor Renate Langer said the director raped her in Gstaad in 1972 when she was 15; a woman identified as Robin M said Polanski assaulted her in 1973 when she was 15; and a third, Marianne Barnard, accused him of assaulting her in 1975 when she was 10. Polanski denies the claims.

In recent months, Polanski’s supporters in Britain and the US, who were once so vocal in his defence, have been notable by their silence. So I decided to ask them how they felt about Polanski now. I start by emailing Zenovich to ask if she feels attitudes towards Polanski have changed since she made her movie and its follow-up, Roman Polanski: Odd Man Out, about the Zurich arrest. But she is too busy preparing for Sundance to engage. I then contact 25 actors who have worked with Polanski since his arrest, including Sigourney Weaver, Ben Kingsley, Christoph Waltz, Kate Winslet, Kim Cattrall, Pierce Brosnan and Jodie Foster. Some don’t reply at all, despite repeated approaches. A few will only talk off the record. The rest say they are too busy. Adrien Brody, who won an Oscar for The Pianist, was “unable to participate due to schedule”. Kingsley, who has worked with Polanski multiple times, would “need to pass”.

I then contact the film-makers who signed the 2009 petition demanding Polanski’s release, including David Lynch, Wes Anderson and Martin Scorsese. Again, some ignore me, a couple will talk off the record, some are too busy to talk at all. Alexander Payne is currently “focused on his new baby”. Tilda Swinton “would like to graciously pass on being interviewed”. Only one person who signed the petition agrees to speak on the record: the actor Asia Argento, who has since accused Weinstein of abusing her.

I ask why she signed the petition in the first place. “I was asked by friends from the Cannes film festival to sign it. I foolishly went along. That’s no excuse, and it’s a decision I regretted almost immediately and have regretted ever since,” she says. “The more I’ve learned about the original case and subsequent events, the more horrified I have become.”

Since Argento went public with her allegations against Weinstein in October, a lot has been written about how the film industry will no longer cover up abuse. But I ask her how it feels to see Polanski, a convicted sex offender, still held up as a celebrated director, and what it says about the industry’s true feelings about women and girls. “It speaks terribly of the industry,” she replies. “It’s shocking that people like Polanski are still revered, celebrated by actors and fellow film-makers and cinematheques around the world who continue to not only promote their work, but also to work with them. I hope the tide is finally turning.”

While researching this article I had a couple of off-the-record discussions with actors and film-makers about their true feelings about Polanski. One admitted they regretted their previous support, given the new allegations, but couldn’t bring themselves to say so publicly. But mainly I heard people insist their friend is not a rapist. They trotted out the familiar defences: the Holocaust and Sharon Tate, of course. “It was a long time ago” was another one, as was: “He’s served his time.” (In 2009, the expert legal affairs writer, Jeffrey Toobin, reported that at that time the prison sentence for an adult defendant who pleaded guilty to statutory rape was likely to be three years in a state prison.) Two said to me that it was a “special situation” because “the girl had been up for it” (this was a common theory at the time. The probation report described Gailey as “physically mature” and “willing”). “Samantha has said that the trauma she has experienced in the past few decades has had a greater impact on her than the original crime,” one said to me, which is doubtless true. But Gailey wouldn’t have had to endure any attention if Polanski hadn’t raped her.

It’s remarkable how much energy Polanski’s supporters have expended defending him, given that the director himself has always been extremely clear about why he did what he did: he is sexually attracted to ‘young girls’, and he has never seen this as a problem. After all, when he was told he was being arrested for rape he was genuinely shocked: “I was incredulous; I couldn’t equate what had happened the day before with rape in any form,” he writes in his autobiography.

The year after he fled the US he gave an interview to Martin Amis, in which he declared: “Judges want to fuck young girls. Juries want to fuck young girls – everyone wants to fuck young girls!” (Amis, clearly shocked, wrote: “Even Humbert Humbert realised that young girls don’t really know whether they are willing or not. The active paedophile is stealing childhoods. Polanski, you sense, has never even tried to understand this.”) After Tate was murdered in 1969, when Polanski was 36, he spent time in Gstaad, where he slept with schoolgirls aged 16 to 19, who were, he writes, “more beautiful, in a natural, coltish way, than they ever would be again”. In 1976, he met Nastassja Kinski and, according to his autobiography, slept with her. When he then learned she was only 15, he continued to sleep with her for several months, he wrote. In 1986, he met the woman who would be his next wife, the actress Emanuelle Seigner. He was 51. She was 18.

Polanski’s autobiography was written seven years after his arrest, and his account of the crime does not smack of a man overly burdened with feelings of guilt. He describes grooming Gailey on the drive to the photoshoot: “I asked when she’d first started having sex,” he writes, as if that’s a normal thing for a 43-year-old man to ask a 13-year-old girl. At Jack Nicholson’s house, she tells him she’s thirsty, so he gives her alcohol. “We weren’t saying much now,” Polanski writes. “But I could sense a certain erotic tension between us.”

Gailey sensed something different. According to her grand jury testimony, she repeatedly asked him to take her home and she was “afraid of him”. When he started kissing her she told him: “No – keep away.” When he performed oral sex on her she was “ready to cry” and asked him to stop.

Polanski recounts what he describes as “making love” so sexily you can practically hear his heavy breathing. “There was no doubt about her experience and lack of inhibition. She spread herself and I entered her. She was not unresponsive,” he writes.

This is how Gailey recalled the crime: “He placed his penis in my vagina. I was mostly just on and off saying: ‘No, stop.’ But I wasn’t fighting really because there was no one else there and I had no place to go. He didn’t answer me when I said no ... Then he lifted up my legs farther and he went in through my anus.”

Afterwards, in Polanski’s car, Gailey cried. But he doesn’t mention that in his book. Instead, he describes trying to arrange a date with her.

Polanski will turn 85 this year, and he has lived almost half his life under the shadow of what Weinstein described as “his so-called crime”. Polanski’s own attitude has remained bullish; in October last year he gave an interview in which he focused his ire on the judges who let him down. “I know what I am, what I have and haven’t done, how things really were and are,” he writes at the end of his autobiography. Thanks to the candour of Polanski, the rest of us have always known, too – including everyone in the film industry who has worked with him since.

Readers in the UK are especially entitled to feel confused, because of course Pizzagate is actually a thing over here. In October 2004, Cesc Fabregas allegedly threw a slice of pizza at Sir Alex Ferguson after a particularly tempestuous match between Arsenal and Manchester United.

101,"Mark Reed Levin ( ; born September 21, 1957) is an American lawyer, author, and radio personality. He is the host of syndicated radio show The Mark Levin Show, as well as Life, Liberty & Levin on Fox News. Levin worked in the administration of President Ronald Reagan and was a chief of staff for Attorney General Edwin Meese. He is the former president of the Landmark Legal Foundation, a best-selling author of seven books, and contributes commentary to various media outlets such as National Review Online. Since 2015, Levin has been editor-in-chief of the Conservative Review[4] and is known for his incendiary commentary.[5]

He has been described as ""right-wing""[6][7][8] and ""conservative"".[9] He is known for his harsh criticisms of Democrats and encouragement of primary challenges to congressional Republicans that he considers to be ""RINO"". He endorsed Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primary and declared himself ""Never Trump"", but reluctantly endorsed Donald Trump after Trump won the Republican nomination.[10] Since the start of the Trump presidency, Levin's commentary has turned staunchly pro-Trump.[11]

Mark Reed Levin, one of three boys, was born in Philadelphia to a Jewish family,[12] and grew up in Erdenheim as well as Elkins Park. His father, Jack E. Levin (1925–2018), was the author of several books.[13] He graduated from Cheltenham High School after three years in 1974.[14][15] Skipping his senior year of high school, Levin enrolled at Temple University Ambler and graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. in Political Science in 1977 at age 19.[16][15] Levin won election to the Cheltenham school board in 1977 on a platform of reducing property taxes.[15] In 1980, Levin earned a J.D. from Temple University Beasley School of Law.[17]

Levin worked for Texas Instruments after law school.[15] Beginning in 1981, Levin served as an adviser to several members of President Ronald Reagan's cabinet. Levin began at ACTION, the federal agency that oversaw VISTA and other volunteer agencies, before serving as deputy assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education at the U.S. Department of Education and deputy solicitor of the U.S. Department of the Interior.[18][19][20] He eventually became the associate director of presidential personnel and ultimately chief of staff to Attorney General Edwin Meese.[18]

After leaving the Reagan administration, Levin practiced law in the private sector. In 1991, Levin joined public interest law firm Landmark Legal Foundation, which specializes in constitutional law, advocating for free enterprise, and limiting governmental power.[21][22][23][24] At Landmark, Levin served as director of legal policy and the foundation's Washington-based Center for Civil Rights before becoming president in 1997.[20][25][18] Under Levin's presidency, Landmark Legal filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission in 2000 alleging that the National Education Association, the largest teachers' union in the U.S., did not disclose spending on political activity in Internal Revenue Service documentation.[26] Landmark Legal also filed similar complaints with the United States Department of Labor in 2002 regarding NEA and political activity; by 2006, the NEA and smaller American Federation of Teachers had filed new documents with the Labor Department revealing over $100 million combined in political action spending.[27]

Following Freedom of Information Act requests in August 2012 of documents that would show if Environmental Protection Agency officials sought to delay regulations until after the 2012 presidential election, federal judge Royce Lamberth ruled in 2015 that although Landmark Legal did not establish that the EPA acted in bad faith, the EPA either carelessly or intentionally neglected Landmark's FOIA request.[28] Lamberth previously ruled in 2013 that the EPA might have attempted to evade Landmark's FOIA request.[29]

In 2001 the American Conservative Union awarded Levin its Ronald Reagan Award for his work with Landmark Legal.[30][31] Politico reported in 2014 that Levin received a salary of more than $300,000 per year as president of the non-profit Landmark Legal Foundation, whose donors include the Sarah Scaife Foundation, the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation and ExxonMobil.[32] In 2018, Levin stepped down as president of Landmark Legal but remained on its board of directors.[33]

Levin began his broadcasting career as a guest on conservative talk radio programs. For many years, he was a frequent contributor of legal opinions to The Rush Limbaugh Show, where Limbaugh referred to him on-air as ""F. Lee Levin"",[34] a tongue-in-cheek reference to the defense attorney F. Lee Bailey. He was also a contributor to The Sean Hannity Show and eventually got a radio slot of his own on WABC, initially on Sundays beginning in 2002, then in the timeslot following Hannity's program in 2003. Cumulus Media Networks began syndicating The Mark Levin Show nationally in 2006. Hannity nicknamed Mark Levin ""The Great One.""[19][35][36]

Levin has participated in Freedom Concerts, an annual benefit concert to aid families of fallen soldiers, and uses his radio program to promote aid to military families.[37] Levin is also involved with Move America Forward, a charity that sends care packages to soldiers serving overseas.[38]

On February 11, 2016, Levin signed a ten-year contract extension with Westwood One, which will take his show through 2025, its 19th year.[39]

On November 16, 2018, he was inducted to the National Radio Hall of Fame.[40]

Since 2014, Levin has been the founding editor-in-chief of Conservative Review, a multi-platform online television network that later merged with Glenn Beck's terrestrial network TheBlaze in 2018 to form Blaze Media. Programs airing on the network include Levin, Roaming Millennial, Truth Be Told, Allie, In the Woods with Phil, Kibbe on Liberty, Louder with Crowder, America Bolling and more.

In November 2017, Fox News announced that it had signed Levin for a weekend show titled Life, Liberty & Levin to air on Sunday nights at 10:00 p.m. Eastern beginning in February 2018.[41] According to a pre-debut network news release, the program will explore ""the fundamental values and principles undergirding American society, culture, politics, and current events, and their relevance to the nation's future and everyday lives of citizens.""[42]

Levin authored the 2005 book Men In Black: How The Supreme Court Is Destroying America, in which he advanced his thesis that activist judges on the Supreme Court (from all parts of the political spectrum) have ""legislated from the bench"". Commentary magazine's Dan Seligman wrote that Levin asks readers ""to identify with 'originalists' who look to the text of the Constitution and the intent of its framers, and to reject the 'activists' who construe the Constitution broadly and are more concerned with getting to their own 'desired outcomes'"".[43] Slate magazine's Dahlia Lithwick wrote that ""no serious scholar of the court or the Constitution, on the ideological left or right, is going to waste their time engaging Levin's arguments once they've read this book"".[44]

Rescuing Sprite: A Dog Lover's Story of Joy and Anguish is a non-fiction work written by Levin in 2007 about his experience of rescuing a dog named Sprite from a local animal shelter.[45]

Liberty and Tyranny: A Conservative Manifesto was released in 2009, and became a #1 New York Times best seller for eleven of twelve weeks,[46] as well as No. 1 on Nielsen BookScan and No. 2 on Amazon.com's list of bestselling books of 2009.[47] The book includes discussion of a variety of issues that, according to Levin, need to be addressed in the United States. In Liberty and Tyranny Levin repudiates the use of the term ""progressive"" to describe ""modern Liberals"" and instead argues a proper term should be ""Statist"". Liberty and Tyranny has sold over one million copies according to Threshold Editions, the book's publisher.[48] Andrew C. McCarthy, in The New Criterion, wrote, ""Levin offers not so much a defense as a plan of attack"" against ""America's Leftist ascendancy"".[49] Other reviewers critiqued the book as ""analysis utterly useless in understanding more than half of the American political landscape"" while opining that ""Levin resorts to the same old misinformation to sell his brand of conservatism"".[50][51]

Ameritopia: The Unmaking of America was released in 2012. In Ameritopia, Levin discusses the origins and development of both the modern day conservative and liberal political philosophies, the latter of which he refers to as ""statist"", through the works of some of the leading figures in American history.[52][53] Included are commentaries on works by Plato, Sir Thomas More, Thomas Hobbes, Karl Marx, John Locke, Charles de Montesquieu and Alexis de Tocqueville.[54] Conor Friedersdorf's review, published in The Atlantic, criticized the text's argument that statism is based on utopianism,[54] and Carlin Romano, in The Chronicle of Higher Education, wrote that ""Ameritopia is really Ameritastrophe. It's disastrously bad from beginning to end.""[55]

The 2013 book The Liberty Amendments: Restoring the American Republic suggests eleven new Constitutional amendments. The book debuted at #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list.[56] Hans A. von Spakovsky of National Review Online called the book ""required reading for conservative bloggers"".[57] Ana Marie Cox, writing in The Guardian, said the book ""contains some radical notions about a complete overhaul of the US constitution, but to debate the specifics of their merits is to ignore the larger insanity of the project"" while noting ""the ludicrousness of his specific 'fixes' and the near-impossibility of achieving them"".[58] In The Washington Times, Tenth Amendment Center Executive Director Michael Lotfi criticized Levin's idea as ""the bullet to a loaded revolver pointed at the Constitution"".[59] Also in The Washington Times, Richard W. Rahn wrote, ""If 'The Liberty Amendments' can help foster a national debate about which corrective actions, including constitutional amendments, are needed to increase liberty and prosperity, Mr. Levin will have performed a great national service"".[60] Hoover Institution fellow David Davenport wrote in Forbes that Levin's book used ""weak arguments"".[61][62]

Levin authored Plunder and Deceit: Big Government's Exploitation of Young People and the Future in 2015,[63] and Rediscovering Americanism and the Tyranny of Progressivism in 2017.

Levin's Unfreedom of the Press, which was released on May 21, 2019, became the number one best-selling book on Amazon.com three days before its official release, as a result of pre-order sales. Unfreedom of the Press also became a New York Times #1 best-seller on June 6, 2019, in the combined print & e-book nonfiction and hardcover nonfiction categories.[64][65][66] Lloyd Green was critical of the book in The Guardian writing that the book ""...is not exactly fan fiction but it can get ahead of itself when discussing the special counsel’s conclusions, ending up sounding like the 'fake news' the author and Trump both purport to abhor.""[67] Annalisa Quinn wrote in NPR online that ""Along the way, [Levin] looks at The New York Times' inadequate coverage of the Holocaust (full disclosure: I write freelance pieces for the Times), and touches on a handful of clear problems in American media, from the often poor distinction between reporting and opinion to the distorting incentives of the Internet."" Quinn continued, ""But the book is largely filler. Quotations and paraphrasing make up the majority of the book's central chapters. Lengthy and irrelevant block quotes from historians about, say, colonial printing practices... give the book the air of a padded student essay.""[68] Quinn also wrote, ""[Levin] conducts no interviews, presents no original research, and visits no newsrooms"", and ""When Levin does offer his own analysis, it can approach parody.""[68] On June 8, 2019, Levin appeared on C-SPAN2's Book TV to discuss Unfreedom of the Press, ""in which he argued that the press has lowered its standards in providing objective and trustworthy journalism.""[69]

A 2016 study which sought to measure incendiary discourse on talk radio and TV found that Levin scored highest on its measure of ""outrage"". The study looked at 10 prominent radio and television programs, known for incendiary discourse on political matters, and scored content on the basis of whether it used ""emotional display"", ""misrepresentative exaggeration"", ""mockery"", ""conflagration"", ""slippery slope"", ""insulting"" or ""obscene language"" and other factors, finding that Levin was the radio host who engaged in the most outrage. The study found that he utilized ""outrage speech or behavior at a rate of more than one instance per minute.""[5] In How Democracies Die, Harvard University political scientists Daniel Ziblatt and Steven Levitsky write that Mark Levin was among the popular right-wing talk radio hosts who ""helped to legitimate the use of uncivil discourse"" in American politics, and contribute to the erosion of democratic norms.[70]

Views on politicians and other individuals

According to The Guardian, ""constant attacks on Democrats and the left are important components"" of Levin's modus operandi.[71] According to Politico in May 2009, Levin pronounced ""almost daily"" that Obama ""was a failure, a liar and a ""statist"" who is trying to destroy individual freedom.""[72] In June 2017, Levin accused Senator Bernie Sanders of being ""a radical Marxist who believes in violence.""[73] According to Rutgers University political scientist Stephen Eric Bronner, Levin tends to use ""socialism"" as a ""catch-all term to condemn any policy that strengthens the social welfare function of the state.""[74] In July 2014, he called Jon Stewart ""a knee-jerk idiot"", and suggested that Stewart was a self-hating Jew.[75] He has stated that ""Nancy Pelosi’s politics comes as close to a form of modern-day fascism as I’ve ever seen.""[5] In January 2019, he called Pelosi ""America’s first fascist"" when she refused to provides billions in funding to President Trump for a border wall.[76] Levin has also mocked how Pelosi looks, referred to Beto O'Rourke as a ""weak man"", and called Dick Blumenthal a ""pathetic, loathsome liar.""[68]

He has criticized Republicans – including Paul Ryan, Lindsey Graham,[7] John McCain, and Mitch McConnell[77] – with whom he disagrees. He sometimes refers to these people as RINOs.[71] In July 2009, Levin called former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum a ""complete and utter fraud"".[78] Levin endorsed Orrin Hatch when he faced a primary challenge in 2012, but later apologized for his endorsement when Hatch said that he would be willing to support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.[32] Since then, he endorsed a number of Republican primary challengers to incumbent Republican senators.[32] Levin supported the Tea Party Patriots' campaign to ""fire"" House Speaker John Boehner.[32] Earlier in 2010, Levin criticized Glenn Beck for his criticism of congressional Republicans.[79] He has referred to Mitt Romney as an ""ass""[68] and called CNN host Brian Stelter a ""creep"".[68]

Levin supported U.S. Representative Mo Brooks in his campaign in the 2017 Alabama special election against incumbent Luther Strange, who had received a temporary appointment earlier that year.[80]

Levin strongly defended former EPA head Scott Pruitt while he was under a dozen separate ethics investigations. Levin said Pruitt's ""policies on the whole have been outstanding,"" and ""I don't throw good people under the bus because the left targets them.""[81]

During the 2012 election cycle, Levin's show was paid at least $757,000 in sponsorship by the Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity to run ads for the group.[32][82] After the sponsorship ended, Levin began doing ads for the Tea Party Patriots.[32] In 2014 the ""Senate Conservatives Fund paid at least $427,000 to Simon & Schuster to purchase copies of one of Levin's books in September and October of 2013.""[32] During the same period, Levin frequently promoted the group, which has funded primary challengers of Senate Republicans, on his radio show and Facebook page.[83] Levin did not disclose that the group had made $427,000 of purchases of his book.[83]

Levin endorsed Orrin Hatch when Levin was being sponsored by Americans for Prosperity (AFP) which also endorsed Hatch. Levin withdrew his endorsement of Hatch when Levin was being sponsored by the Tea Party Patriots, a group that funded challengers to Hatch; and Levin endorsed primary challengers when the Senate Conservatives Fund, a group which funded primary challengers to incumbent Republicans, purchased $427,000 worth of his books.[32][82][83] Levin dismissed the allegations that he engages in ""pay-to-play"".[83]

In 2009, Levin described as ""absolutely right"" the statement by Sarah Palin that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) includes death panels to decide whether elderly people or sick children were worthy of medical care.[84][85] In 2011, a caller to Levin's show, claiming to be a neurosurgeon, said that the Department of Health and Human Services had issued a document saying that people over age 70 would not be allowed to receive medical treatments. Levin said to the caller, ""so Sarah Palin was right."" The call was later revealed to be a hoax and the death panel claims were revealed to be false.[86][87][88] Levin satirically noted the similarities between a gathering of ""hand-picked"" supporters of the Affordable Care Act chosen by the Obama administration to Nazi Sturmabteilung or ""Brownshirts"" drawing comparisons of the propaganda techniques of the two groups.[89][90]

Levin stated in 2013 that ""the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated our government"" and called President Obama a Muslim Brotherhood ""sympathizer"".[91][92]

In February 2015, Levin stated that President Obama of ""seeking to destroy Israel"" because ""Obama has an affinity for Islam far more than Christianity or Judaism."" Levin also blamed Obama for the Ebola crisis, saying ""the political policies of this administration which opens the door wide to people from the poorest parts of the world. We don't know who they are, we don't know if they have diseases.""[89]

In March 2016, Levin endorsed Ted Cruz for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.[93] Over a month after Donald Trump was nominated, in September 2016, Levin stated on this radio program that he would vote for Trump in the general election, following his declaration earlier that year that he was in the ""Never Trump"" camp and would never vote for Trump.[94][95][96] He qualified his support by stating that, ""I take no responsibility for the dumb things he says or the dumb things his surrogates say.""[97]

In October 2019, while Trump was the subject of an impeachment inquiry resulting in his impeachment, Levin said that ""While he's been president there hasn't even been a hint of scandal. Not a hint!""[98]

In March 2017, Levin alleged that the Obama administration had used ""police state"" surveillance tactics against the Donald Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election. The Associated Press said that Levin ""voiced without evidence the idea that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower"".[99] Levin protested the AP report vigorously, demanding a retraction and an apology on the grounds that his sources for the statement included The New York Times and other newspapers.[100] His statement was reprinted by Breitbart News and reportedly became the basis of President Trump's unfounded Trump Tower wiretapping allegations.[71][101] In September 2017, reports emerged of a court-ordered Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) wiretap on Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort; while certain Trump supporters alleged that this surveillance vindicated Levin and Trump's unsupported assertions, The Atlantic noted: ""This is not true – Trump claimed he had been the subject of Obama-ordered, politically motivated surveillance, for which there remains no evidence.""[102]

Levin has said that there is a ""coup"" occurring against the presidency of Donald Trump waged by Obama loyalists.[103][104] Levin's coup claim was referring to investigations of the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and of alleged obstruction of justice by Trump. He has suggested that former FBI Director James Comey used the Trump-Russia dossier ""to blackmail the president.""[105][106] He has claimed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller engaged in a ""Deep State"" coup against Trump.[104]

In February 2018, Levin said the Nunes Memo shows ""Hillary Clinton paid for a warrant"" and ""Hillary Clinton colluded with the Russians...it appears the FBI at the senior-most levels colluded with the Russians too.""[107]

In August 2018, Levin stated that Mueller is a ""greater threat to this Republic and Constitution than anything Vladimir Putin did during the [2016] campaign.""[108][109] When Mueller released a report summarizing the finding of his Special Counsel probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Levin called the report ""crap"".[104] He complained that Obama was not interviewed in the probe. He said that Trump could not have engaged in obstruction of justice, because the probe should never have happened.[104]

After President Trump pressed the President of Ukraine to start an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Levin strongly defended Trump's actions. Asked on Fox & Friends whether Levin was ""okay"" with Trump asking a foreign leader for ""dirt"" on Biden, Levin lashed out at the Fox & Friends host and repeatedly shouted there was ""no problem"" with what Trump did. Shortly thereafter, Trump praised Levin and retweeted more than 20 tweets by viewers praising Levin.[110][111][112] Levin also accused Joe Biden of being the one who ""did something illegal"", though he did not provide evidence or elaborate.[113]

In 2014, Levin claimed that the Bush administration's original WMD rationale for the Iraq War had been vindicated by citing reports of U.S. soldiers in Iraq that were wounded by the decayed remnants of Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons arsenal. The remnants in question were degraded and unusable chemical weapons shells from the 1980s. Levin faulted the Bush administration for not doing more to publicize these remnants of Iraq's former WMD program.[114]",mainstream,M14dde,pizzagate

 The Millennium Report Exclusive

 This is clearly evidenced in the current internal conflicts of the 17 federal intelligence agencies that have arisen from the new Russian “Trump blackmail” scandal and the DNC hacking scandal that was an attempt to derail the presidential election. These scandals happen again and again and involve warring federal agencies who are theoretically supposed to be protecting Americans. Instead, there is open warfare between the three different factions of the CIA and their enemies who are considered the “lesser agencies”: the NSA, FBI, Homeland Security, National Intelligence Agency, and the other redundant twelve U.S. intelligence agencies. Even the mainstream media, with all of its state sponsored legal propaganda, admits that this conflict is going on.

 What is the Central Intelligence Agency?

The CIA overrides all other intelligence agencies because it can always pull the “international security” card from its sleeve and trump the lesser agencies which only have the lower priority “national security.” Presidential executive orders can be top secret and can be kept from agencies not responsible for their enforcement. So if the president conducts “international” top-secret business, he can exclude U.S. intelligence agencies from this top secret intel because they only have lower national security clearance. Essentially, the president of the United States currently conducts “international” warfare without the U.S. Congress, Supreme Court, or U.S. citizens even knowing those wars exist. The president can also wage all types of war secretly within U.S. borders because Obama changed the National Defense Authorization Act, with congressional approval, to give him those powers. Other extraordinary presidential powers have been consolidated through numerous executive orders in the last eight years.

 The president now holds more power than ever and these powers are unconstitutional, illegal, and unethical. If you read the executive orders that are made available on the National Registry you will see that Obama has been conducting secret warfare on foreign countries and individuals both outside of and inside America. It is scary enough to know that under the auspices of “national security,” the president can seize all assets in America under these new powers. But scarier than this is that the CIA can still trump the president under the auspices of “international security.”

 KEY POINT: The CIA has positioned itself to be a higher authority than Congress, the President, or We the People and can act in secrecy in all of its affairs. 

 The power of the CIA was demonstrated with the recent scandal of “fake news” about President-elect Trump being blackmailed by Russia. The fake dossier of “evidence” was brought into this country from Britain through the CIA. When U.S. intelligence agencies, the other 16 besides the CIA, tried to figure out the fake news/CIA propaganda they fell flat on their faces, as usual. The CIA tried to start a “smear campaign” against Trump. James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, apparently couldn’t see through the ruse and agreed with the CIA’s assessment. So a citizen is lead to the conclusion that either all of our intelligence agencies are lacking in capacity and intelligence capabilities OR they are kowtowing to Clapper and/or the CIA.

 When Reagan started the position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI) with executive order 12333 in 1981, it was essentially an overthrow of the existing National Security Agency (NSA) which had always been a military organization run by a high-ranking officer. The DNI’s principle job is defined as overseeing the CIA and by doing so, the DNI is actually the head of all other intelligence agencies. But note, the DNI only “oversees” the CIA, it does not “control” the CIA.

 Who is James Clapper?

 There are 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies working for the federal government on issues of domestic and international intelligence in 10,000 locations with over 854,000 people holding top-secret clearances. Private “vendors” constitute 29% of the U.S. intelligence workforce and account for 49% of the overall intelligence community budget. The current DNI is James Clapper who lied under oath to Congress when he gave false testimony that the NSA does not collect any type of data on Americans. Clapper was the former chief operating officer for the British military intelligence company Detica, and also worked at the same time for two other private intelligence agencies, SRA and Booz Allen Hamilton.

 Clapper currently controls an annual budget of around $75 billion and was a former British private spy but could not figure out that the recent fake news propaganda against Trump was complete garbage. Yes, fellow patriots, you read this correctly. A man who is in charge of a $75 billion a year intelligence budget with a professional spy background couldn’t see through the CIA’s attempt to smear Trump’s integrity. But We the People armed with our independent truth media saw through it in a New York minute.

 Key Point: In a country governed by the rule of law, which ours is not apparently, this type of smearing is called defamation of character and is illegal.

 Clapper has the following agencies under his control: Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of State, Department of the Treasury, Defense Intelligence Agency, Air Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Marine Corps Intelligence, Navy Intelligence, Coast Guard Intelligence, Department of Energy, National Reconnaissance Office, Drug Enforcement Administration, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. He ordered the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to place all the collected intelligence from these 17 agencies under his control. And remember that the CIA has the all-powerful “international security” clearance which gives Clapper a higher security position that any of the other agencies listed or our elected officials.

 Ultimately, James A. Clapper (known liar and globalist) controls all intelligence in America YET has demonstrated himself to be an enemy of America. After gaining the highest security clearances in America, Clapper then worked for GeoEye, was on the board of three government contractors, worked for Detica (British military intelligence), BAE Systems, SRA International and Booz Allen Hamilton.

 From the outside it looks like Clapper works for himself out of a drive for power, control and money. He demonstrated his true nature when he left the services of America and worked for British and international private spy agencies, spying on America and using his security clearances as weapons against America. This is clearly demonstrated by his non-stop consolidation of power in the position of Director of National Intelligence. At this point, the president acts upon “intelligence” delivered by one man, James Clapper. When the intelligence is false, as it has been since Clapper was appointment by Obama, America can more easily be sold out to transnational, international, and globalist interests.

 Our research indicates that James Clapper usually hires outside intelligence agencies to conduct the most sensitive cases involving cyberwarfare. That is why Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee hired the most commonly used cyber warlord Dmitri Alperovitch and this company CrowdStrike to investigate the breach of security and hacking on the DNC server. Even though this was definitively a national security issue, Clapper and his gang of 17 intelligence agencies have yet to start an investigation. Clapper simply “believed” and publicly endorsed, through Hillary’s false claims during the presidential debates, the ridiculous claims of Dmitri though no evidence has yet to come forward. Dmitri recently had two interviews on national news where he said repeatedly there was no evidence of Russian hacking the DNC and that the claims of Putin’s involvement was his own idea, again backed by no evidence.

 See our article Russian Hackers Found for more information on Alperovitch and CrowdStrike.

 It is crystal clear that James Clapper has allowed the number one intelligence vendor for cyberwarfare, CrowdStrike, to dominate governmental and corporate cyber breaches. To date, Dmitri and CrowdStrike have had many contracts to find and end cyber-attacks and have not successfully prosecuted a single hacker nor been able to secure any governmental system from attacks. It is also quite odd that Dmitri’s father, Michael Alperovitch, is the number one encryption code expert in America and has essentially created and controls the codes for most military information systems as well as many prominent corporate systems. Clapper didn’t seem to care that Dmitri was a criminal hacker arrested by the FBI and turned into their top cyber hacker against Russian gangsters stealing American’s identities through online scams. Michael Alperovitch was supposedly a Russian nuclear physicist who magically became a U.S. citizen that was hired by the biggest data systems in America to write and maintain encryption codes. Essentially, just as complete control of the 17 intelligence agencies is control by Clapper, the encryption codes of America are controlled by one Russian—Michael Alperovitch.

 Key Point: If James Clapper and Michael Alperovitch defected, the entire American intelligence community could collapse. 

 Centralization of power in just a few people usually goes wrong and in this case it has gone very wrong. Clapper is not interested in accurate intelligence; he is simply a propaganda machine like the Nazi Bureau of Information. Clapper wants us to believe anything he says without any proof simply based upon the fact that “17 intelligence agencies” all agree with him. Essentially, any determination of James Clapper speaks for the other “16 intelligence agencies,” even if there is no evidence or whether any other agency was asked their opinion.

 War of the NSA versus the CIA

 The domestic battle for America is highlighted in Obama’s recent executive order allowing the NSA’s complete surveillance of America and the world to be shared with the other 16 intelligence agencies before the NSA scrubs the stolen transmissions.

 How did this happen? Clapper was manipulated by the CIA’s leaks from Snowden, proving his testimony before Congress concerning NSA surveillance to be false. The CIA was compromised by the NSA leak, and the CIA’s main international offices in Geneva were found to be tied to Swiss banking scandals and CIA illegal activities. The CIA did not realize that every Cisco router and server had a back-door for NSA spying. The CIA was furious because their European headquarters was super-secret and the CIA believed it was un-hackable. The CIA demanded that the NSA stop spying on their criminal activities which included gold fixing and gold market manipulation with Swiss bankers. The NSA’s surveillance brought numerous Swiss bankers to justice and they were not willing to stop spying on the CIA because that information connected them to the work of many criminals that they were in league with.

 In retaliation against the NSA, the CIA chose Edward Snowden, who was working for the CIA through Booz Allen Hamilton, to release stolen NSA documents that proved the NSA was illegally spying on Americans through computers, phones, and many other electronic devices. Snowden didn’t work for the NSA and did not have access to NSA files though he released a huge amount of data that confirmed the NSA’s surveillance. Michael Alperovitch’s CIA handlers ordered Snowden to turn over the NSA’s PKI encryption codes so that the CIA could enter the NSA’s system and steal the files needed to prove the NSA’s illegal surveillance. Snowden did not personally have access to those codes nor the information in the NSA system as part of his job.

 The CIA was not concerned about the NSA’s reputation and just wanted to stop the NSA from spying on them because the NSA had uncovered the nature of the three factions in the CIA that work against each other, an internal war of sorts. Clapper was called to the Congress and under oath swore that the NSA did not spy on Americans in any fashion. He perjured himself repeatedly with the lie that no surveillance was going on at all on any American. This was, of course, found to be false and that, in fact, the NSA spies on every American and even has a file for every person in America extracted principally from the Internet, Google, Facebook (all social media), every PC, phones, and bank accounts among other sources. Snowden’s “leaks” have become the bane of the NSA who now has to admit they certainly do spy on Americans because Obama expanded the NDAA to include Americans as warfare combatants.

 The battle between the CIA and the NSA became public again when the CIA set up a sting that uncovered that Cisco Systems, a DARPA company, has built-in back doors on all their routers so that the NSA can spy undetected. The main stream media was even given videos of Cisco employees installing the backdoors in routers. The CIA found out about the back doors and made the information public to stop the NSA’s hacking of the CIA systems. Cisco Systems essentially controlled 100% of Internet traffic up until 1998 with a monopoly that was created as a DARPA project to weaponize the Internet as the ultimate intelligence collection tool. When the CIA released these videos, Obama distanced himself from Cisco publicly and would not come to their aid because the evidence was overwhelming. Cisco lost $50 billion over the scandal and a good deal of confidence of the public but was not prosecuted.

 It was because of this battle between the CIA and the NSA and other intelligence agencies that lead to Obama’s recent executive order making available all the data from NSA spying to the other 16 intelligence agencies. Now, the CIA will know exactly what the NSA is collecting and then do better at hiding their own information systems and the criminal activity that is conducted on those systems. No longer can the NSA hide information from the Director of National Intelligence (James Clapper) and the CIA. Of course, this action would mean little if these agencies were not conducting illegal activities and were actually working for the American people and the Constitution of the United States of America. But we must remember that the CIA is in charge of international security which trumps the NSA’s national security.

 Three Factions of the CIA

 It is easy to see the war between the 17 U.S. intelligence agencies raging in the news. But there is a great deal of confusion about actions that the intelligence agencies conduct that indicate that the war is much bigger and more complicated that most imagine. It is impossible to understand intelligence wars between these different agencies until the factions of the CIA are clearly pictured. The three factions of the CIA create most of the wars and the chaos surrounding them.

 Anything “international” is the CIA’s concern, including currency wars, market wars, banking wars, cyber wars, and the wars on drugs and terrorism. Since Obama’s rewritten NDAA allows the military to target American citizens as domestic terrorists and enemy combatants, there are no limits for the CIA at this point. Everyone is considered a terrorist until proven innocent according to the Patriot Act. The CIA can label anyone, or any agency or company as an “international security” threat, even without evidence. This came about because the CIA split into three factions that act as double and triple agents, spying on everyone for profit as intelligence mercenaries. America is surrounded by CIA control and the Washington D. C. is besieged with CIA swamp monsters.

 See our article on the NDAA as Legal Propaganda Against U.S. Citizens.

 We need to tell the story of the three factions of the CIA to understand why chaotic dynamics led American politicians by the nose to such embarrassing stupidity as the NDI’s report that 17 intelligence agencies had irrefutable proof that Iraq had “weapons of mass destruction.” This false flag intelligence, which arose originally as a report from the CIA, caused the horrible deaths of untold numbers and cost the U.S. taxpayer more than $3 trillion dollars to date. The CIA produced the secret intelligence but never came forward and admitted their part in these crimes against humanity. The CIA usually uses false flag events to start wars and cause conflicts with other countries. The CIA uses false flags in America as legal propaganda to create narratives that control American perception management which is laced with subliminal control messaging that is tantamount to brainwashing.

 Faction #1: The Original CIA, aka, Gold-backed CIA

 The original CIA started many years ago when the OSS, the original CIA, stole the gold and assets of the countries involved in WWII. The gold of Germany and Japan that had been amassed and stolen from many other countries during the war ended up in the hands of the CIA and couldn’t be openly admitted. The CIA was not about to give back the largest pile of gold ever amassed. This gold was outside of the U.S. and was being held in the Philippines and Switzerland. If it would have been brought back into America and added to the U.S. Treasury, it could have destabilized the dollar and world currencies.

 American politicians could not admit that they knew about this stolen loot so they let the CIA handle it. Over the years, numerous CIA banks, corporations, dummy companies, offshore accounts, and secret vaults were created to hold and launder this gold (and assets) into semi-legitimate operations. The CIA called these operations “The Company” and eventually the Company developed over 3,000 holdings. Some of these banks and corporations are among the largest in the world. The CIA “Company” became larger and more powerful than major countries. The operation was run on a strict “need to know” basis so that government officials always had “culpable deniability.” These operations became independent and after a while no one person was fully aware of all that the Gold-backed CIA (GB-CIA) was doing around the world.

 The gold backed or GB-CIA was supposed to operate outside of the U.S. to protect American interests but national markets of currency, bonds, and stocks all have an “international” impact, which was the domain of the GB-CIA. Accordingly, the GB-CIA infiltrated the U.S. Treasury and the Economic Stabilization Fund (ESF) which creates U.S. economic policy. The ESF has the ability to manipulate currency, bonds, and stock markets in America. The ESF is the organization that tells the Federal Reserve System what to do. The ESF can order the Treasury to print trillions of dollars (which they recently did) and tell the Federal Reserve what to do with the money. The ESF is one of the GB-CIA’s best tools for controlling U.S. national markets that subsequently effect international markets. The GB-CIA essentially controls U.S. economy under the auspices of “international security.”

 The GB-CIA is greedy and is never satisfied with what they have so they foment wars throughout the world to help establish central banking systems in all countries and to always be ready to strip assets and steal whatever they can. Imagine thousands of ruthless operations run by people who do not mind killing anyone who stands in their way. Think of all of the top bankers, brokers, and insiders around the Bush and Clinton families who have been shot, suicided, or had mysterious heart attacks or other unexplained deaths. There have been hundreds of these deaths that demonstrate the seriousness of GB-CIA operations. Once a person is made aware (complicit) of the evil criminal activities of the Company, participants are co-opted for life and must comply or meet their fate. Of course they are provided with everything they desire from the almost limitless resources of the GB-CIA. Even the most horrible and sick desires of these operatives are provided to appease the fact that operatives do not ever get to leave the Company and deep files of blackmail materials are maintained that can be used to assure silence and cooperation.

 The GB-CIA set up the worst forms of sexual depravities, pedophilia, and sacrificial rituals to provide opportunities to gain compromising video footage of operatives and the politicians they pulled into these sick and twisted activities. The GB-CIA created group after group that aimed to co-opt any person in power so that they could control all aspects of government and business to protect their interests and hidden strategies. The GB-CIA created many of the largest global pedophile rings online, which was recently admitted in the news by the CIA. It also created the largest human sex trafficking market using U.S. charities that place refugees in America as one of their many sources. The drug trafficking of the GB-CIA is very well known from the Iran-Contra scandal to the protected fields of poppies in Afghanistan. Drugs, sex, money, power, control and evil are the currencies of the GB-CIA that “buy” their operatives for life.

 Faction #2: The Bush CIA 

 These practices were made legal when George Bush Sr. was vice president, about the same time that all 16 intelligence agencies came under the control of one person, the Director of National Intelligence. Remember that it was Bush Sr., prior head of the CIA, who was actually calling the shots under Reagan from his second year in office when Reagan allowed Bush Sr. to become the head of U.S. foreign policy. This was an unprecedented event and gave Bush Sr. the go ahead to use CIA methods to “bring down Russia,” which he effectively accomplished.

 During the “reign” of George Bush Sr., Russia’s currency was attacked and destabilized by Leo Wanta and George Soros using fake U.S. Treasury bonds and currency from the U.S. Treasury. Bush Sr.’s brother ran Riggs Bank which created an affiliate, Velment Bank, to launder the money and gold stolen from Russia. Some of the money was laundered through Mitt Romney’s company, Bain Capital. Once the USSR collapsed, Bush Sr. and the “Vulcans” (Bush’s Neocon strike force) stripped every asset they could from Russia, especially the oil that was in the countries that had split from the USSR. Bush Sr. and Kissinger made a personal fortune through the work of what would become a rogue faction of the CIA.

 Bush Sr. continued expanding his rogue CIA to include the White House, the Justice Department and the State Department. Any illegal activities of the rogue CIA were then forgiven by federal judges and State Department officials. This faction of the CIA, which we will call the Bush-CIA, is also called the Bush Criminal Family. Bush co-opted the Clinton’s even before Bill ran for governor of Arkansas. Obama’s mother was a CIA operative and Obama has been involved with the CIA since birth. Obama is completely a creation of the CIA. The problem with Obama is that he is involved with all three factions of the CIA and doesn’t know which way he is going. Thus, his chaotic policies attempted to please the original CIA and the Bush/Clinton criminal family.

 Pizzagate recently brought forward the fact that John Podesta and his brother are not only the most powerful lobbyists in Washington but that they are also at the top of pedophilia in the U.S. government, and have been since the Reagan administration. Bush Sr. actually ran the Reagan administration and pedophilia was commonplace in the White House and throughout the Washington elite. It was so commonplace that the ethics of congressmen went straight to hell because the White House itself was so openly involved in sex crimes at the highest levels. Numerous scandals rocked the White House and even reached the main stream media.

 No one was able to stop Bush Sr. from doing what he wanted because he controlled the CIA since the time that he led the CIA team that assassinated John Kennedy. Bush Sr. tried to assassinate Reagan but failed in the attempt. Eventually, the White House, the Justice Department, and the State Department were accustomed to running these perverse operations of the Bush-CIA and made sure no politician was ever convicted.

 Tensions Mount When the GB-CIA Finds Out About the Bush-CIA

 George Bush Sr. was a secret CIA operative at the time of John Kennedy assassination. He learned then that the GB-CIA had come to dominate the geopolitical realm internationally and that a convenient assassination or “regime change” could produce whatever desired effect the GB-CIA wanted. Bush Sr. was in charge of foreign policy and took his running orders from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) which was filled with ex-CIA and intelligence operatives from government and industry. Bush Sr. acted as though he was following the policies of the CFR but may have been secretly envious of the GB-CIA’s wealth and power that he quickly became one of the most crooked politicians in American history. Bush Sr. developed blackmail files on everyone and made sure that political appointees were thoroughly indoctrinated and warned that straying from the path was dangerous and even fatal.

 Bush Sr. decided that Russia had gold, oil, and assets that could be stolen easily if he set up his own private CIA that would attack sovereign nations for profit. Bush Sr. fully understood the power of the GB-CIA to control U.S. economic interests, and his greed inspired him to create the Bush-CIA which was linked especially to Saudi Arabian, German, and Israeli intelligence. Bush Sr. wanted the wealth of the GB-CIA but he knew he could not personally own it, so he struck out on his own to conquer Russia and any other country or corporation that stood in his way.

 As the vice president, and later the president, Bush Sr. had to act as if he was a devoted follower of the GB-CIA while creating his own network of private intelligence agencies to help him “privatize.” That is why Bush Sr. became “best friends” with the Saudi royal family and eventually came to live the majority of his time in Saudi Arabia in the palaces of the royal family. Bush Sr. knew how to align himself him the world’s largest weapons dealers, drug lords, mafias, and corrupt bankers. Bush Sr. was free as the vice president to travel and conduct his business without any scrutiny from any governmental or law enforcement agency.

 Eventually, the GB-CIA became aware of the designs of the Bush-CIA and tension began to mount. Bush realized he would not be supported by the GB-CIA for a second term so he groomed his old CIA Iran-Contra buddy Bill Clinton to assume the role as the top political leader of the Bush-CIA. As Bush was exiting the White House he became a major leader of the Carlyle Group which owned Cheney’s Halliburton and 400 other companies focused on warfare, defense, and security. Bush Sr. became a billionaire from this one position. He also founded Barrick Gold Corporation which became the number one gold laundering corporation for GB-CIA gold. Bush Sr., Kissinger and the “Vulcans” capitalized on stealing the oil from the countries that exited the USSR.

 Bush Sr.’s brother had stolen much of the gold from Russia as George Soros and Leo Wanta (directed by Bush Sr.) collapsed the currency and made trillions. Bush Sr., in a matter of two years, became incredibly wealthy and even more powerful than before. He had some loyal followers in the GB-CIA, but the division between the GB-CIA and the Bush-CIA grew larger over time. The GB-CIA didn’t really need Bush Sr.’s wealth, they just needed his corporate and governmental connections. No one in the GB-CIA believed Bill Clinton was actually in charge because they knew he took his marching orders from Bush Sr.

 Bill Clinton let his membership in the Bush Criminal family go to his head and he began making big mistakes. The GB-CIA provided Clinton with all of the illicit sex that he could handle until he became deluded and thought he could do anything and suffer no consequences. This led Bill and Hillary to create the most pathetic international money grab, under the auspices of a charity, in American history. Bill and Hillary began to think they were untouchable and this delusion led Hillary to believe she was entitled to be the first woman president – backed up by the Bush-CIA as she and Bill started accumulating their own wealth through the Clinton Foundation.

 Bush Jr. followed in the footsteps of his father and did everything his dad told him to do – even though he was not smart enough to understand the orders. Bush Jr. kept the same Neoconservatives and Vulcans in his cabinet as Clinton and Bush Sr. had appointed. Essentially, the Bush-CIA made the two political parties into one party controlled by the same people. Voting was a formality because all candidates had to be screened and approved by the two political factions of the CIA.

 Key Point: Bush Jr. and Sr., Bill and Hillary Clinton, and Obama are all the same party – CIA Globalists pushing for the New World Order which was Bush Sr. greatest dream. Had Bush Sr. had his way, the United Nations would own America under a New World Order and the CIA would run the United Nations.

 Knowing about the Bush-CIA (the Bush-Clinton-Obama Crime Family), explains why Bush Sr., Bush Jr., Clinton and Obama literally got away with murder during their administrations. Scandal after scandal and yet the Justice Department did nothing.

 Hillary brokered weapons deals from the State Department as Secretary of State and shook down 120 nations for donations to her personal foundation and yet the Justice Department and State Department closed their eyes. Hillary and Obama destroyed the Department of Defense through the Bush-CIA’s control of executive orders that conducted war without congressional approval, every day of Obama’s administration. And yet, only a few voices in the congress spoke up and pointed out these treasonous acts and crimes against humanity. It is this blatant disregard for the U.S. Constitution and rule of law that has caused a greater rift between the GB-CIA and the Bush-CIA.

 Faction #3: Ex-CIA 

 At this point, there are open hostilities between the GB-CIA and the Bush-CIA and when you add the third faction of the CIA, the Ex-CIA, all hell breaks loose. When the GB-CIA and the Bush-CIA operatives saw what was going on between the GB-CIA (that likes to “change regimes” and blackmail politicians and operatives with the most grotesque personal perversions) and the greedy, out-of-control power mongers of the Bush-CIA, the third CIA faction thought they should steal a part of the “action” themselves. So many ex-CIA operatives left the government and went into the lucrative private intelligence agencies who do 65% of the intelligence work for America.

 This faction of the CIA is composed of ex-CIA and intelligence directors, agents, and operatives who are shuffled through the highest positions in government, banking, and the corporate world. The Ex-CIA was born as a chaotic group of operatives who have worked for the GB-CIA or the Bush-CIA. They have seen the endless money available for insiders and the Bush-CIA’s penchant for using private intelligence agencies to manipulate politicians, governments, and markets.

 What is unique and telling about this third faction of the CIA is how their members rotate through the most powerful governmental and corporate jobs. Let’s just take James Comey, Head of the FBI as an example. Comey is a lawyer who was formerly the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Deputy Attorney General, Senior Vice President of Lockheed Martin (one of the largest military contractors that “loses” trillions of dollars), General Counsel for Bridgewater Associates (CIA corporation), Board Member of HSBC (CIA Bank), HSBC Holdings (depository for GB-CIA gold), and then the Director of the FBI. This is the usual type of career path of high level CIA operatives.

 Soon, we can expect Comey to move to another position where he makes a fortune protecting the very criminals he was supposedly prosecuting weeks before. Comey protected the Bush-Clinton-Obama Crime family starting with his appointment as special counsel to the Senate Whitewater Committee. He was also prosecutor in the Khobar Towers bombing, lead investigator in the Clinton pardon of Marc Rich, the investigation of Credit Suisse First Boston and foreign exchange trading scams, the domestic surveillance by the NSA, the HSBC Holdings scandal involving money laundering, and terrorism financing, the U.S. Attorney dismissal scandal, Hillary Clinton email scandal, the Apple scandal to install “back doors” on their computers, and many other similar cases. Comey is always there to do the bidding of all three factions of the CIA.

 John Brennan, the current Director of the CIA was formerly the Deputy National Security Advisor for Homeland Security, Station Chief in Saudi Arabia, Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, CEO of The Analysis Corporation (intelligence network), Chairman of the Intelligence and National Security Alliance (filled with ex-intelligence agents), lead intelligence officer for Global Strategies Group, Global Intelligence Solutions, and GTEC. Brennan’s term as CIA Director is noted for pervasive levels of global surveillance, massive number of drone strikes, hacking U.S. Senators, and CIA torture. When Obama wanted Brennan to be CIA Director, his nomination was blocked so Obama created a new position for Brennan called the Deputy National Security Advisor for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, which did not require Senate confirmation.

 Almost every former head of the CIA or FBI has similar career histories. One appointment after the next places them in key positions that protect the three factions of the CIA. Ex-CIA operatives play both sides of the fence working for the GB-CIA and the Bush-CIA. Just look how James Comey was appointed to protect the Bush and Clinton families in his government appointment and then quickly moves into HSBC, one of the most corrupt CIA banks in the world, to protect them during its investigations. He protected Lockheed Martin when it was caught laundering money for the Bush-CIA. Then Comey jumps back into the highest national intelligence position at the FBI to protect the Clintons again.

 Comey is a very good example of what has been the revolving door of CIA operatives in the government. Comey is an ex-CIA intelligence operative who works for the Bush-CIA and knows all about the GB-CIA. Comey is a shining example of the corruption that pervades American politics and international corporate warfare. Comey, Brennan, and Clapper provide the intelligence for the president, the military and all agencies in the U.S. government. They ostensibly control America because our military and politicians are only as good as the intelligence they are provided.

 Three CIA Factions Fight One Another in Syria 

 Key Point: The three factions of the CIA can create tremendous confusion and hostilities.

 If you were confused by who and what is the CIA, now you can see why it has all been confusing. It is hard to know who is on whose side. The operatives change sides frequently and pretend to support one side or another depending upon the situation. When one faction or another decides an operative has been compromised, they simply kill him. There has been a long list of ex-CIA operatives who have killed themselves even though they had all the riches and power a person could imagine. The hostilities between the three factions eventually boiled over into total chaos during the Obama years. You can now read in the headlines of mainstream media news that Obama created and funds ISIS. Obama sent ISIS into Syria under orders of the GB-CIA to conduct a “regime change” because Syria would not let a pipeline be built from Iraq to the western shores of Syria. Obama supplied and funded the mercenaries (ISIS) who claim to be Muslim terrorists who are fighting Syria’s sovereign king. Obama also used the Bush-CIA to fund, supply, and train Syrian rebels. Obama also uses ex-CIA operatives to fund, supply and train Kurdish rebels.

 All three CIA factions are operating in Syria and the entire world has noticed. Recent reports in mainstream media point out that the CIA is fighting pentagon supported troops in Syria. In one recent instance outside of Aleppo, three different American supported groups were fighting each other. This embarrassment has caused Obama to go into high gear and force James Clapper to “invent” intelligence that would distract from the Syrian fiasco. Fake news about the DNC election hacking, nonsense about Trump being blackmailed by Russia, and Homeland Security’s pathetic attempts to hack into voter databases have all been a smoke screen to distract from Obama’s personal war in Syria.

 Clapper, Brennan and Comey were happy to agree that 17 intelligence agencies all agreed to these false flag attempts at perception management. All these ridiculous attacks on Trump have backfired and instead have shown a glaring light on the corruption, collusion, globalism, and Anti-American disposition of the three factions of the CIA.

 Trump – the Anti-CIA Warrior

 Trump has become enemy number one for all three factions of the CIA because he stands against globalism and promotes the rule of law. The CIA factions thought they were above the law and had become so lax in their gross misuse of power that they are in “shock and awe” at the victory of Trump’s anti-globalism, anti-New World Order platform. They are now frantically trying to cover their evil footprints and muster all three factions to openly discredit and stop Trump from doing what Kennedy had promised – dismantle the CIA.

 Trump is fully aware that his life is in extreme danger from the people who murder without hesitation to protect the CIA and its various interests around the world. Trump was the wild card they could have never imaged and they have no real “dossier” on Trump because there is no more dirt on Trump than already came out in the election. Trump is clean of involvement with all three factions of the CIA and knows that the only way to win America back for Americans is to confront the CIA and the corporate intelligence networks and close them down. Trump knows that he cannot trust any Washington insider because they may be compromised already and under the thumb of CIA blackmail and control.

 Side note: Trump is wise not to set up office at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue where every room in the place is infested with CIA listening devices. Patriots, we need to support funding for a total interior gutting and renovation of the White House!

 Even the international players in the global CIA game have come out from hiding and are attacking Trump with everything they have. George Soros, who works for all three CIA factions from time to time, has now come out proudly on the world stage to attack Trump openly and he is using every one of his political groups to foment dissent. Even the Bilderberg Group, the Trilateralists, the members of the Bohemian Grove, and the Council of Foreign Relations have had extraordinary meetings to plan strategies to stop Trump from becoming president. Every evil cabal in the world is nervous, if not downright “out of their minds” at this point. They have tried killing him, bribing him, offering him endless power, and all the usual methods that work on others all in vain. Trump is still moving forward and amassing a cabinet of the most powerful people in America. All three CIA’s are terrified by the fact that no one can control Trump and that he is not interested in the vices the CIA usually deals in.

 How to Stop the Overthrow of America by the CIA

 The Anonymous Patriots have in prior articles been so bold as to lay out a plan to stop the overthrow of America by transnational interests. These ideas will only work if the three factions of the CIA are first brought under control or defeated. This will be the most difficult task of all that our new president faces. None of these ideas can be accomplished without a fantastic team of honest lawyers who will have to prosecute many people. That is why investigating, auditing and assessing governmental agencies will be one of the first tasks. These lawyers will have to gather the evidence for convictions by “following the money” and seizing assets and prosecuting individuals and corporations.

 Here is a list of the tasks needed if the CIA control of America is to be broken.

 Investigate George Bush Sr.’s involvement in Kennedy’s death, the assassination attempt on Reagan, the economic collapse of the USSR, his involvement with Barrick Gold, Riggs Bank, Velment Bank, the Brady Durham Bond scandal, the attacks of 911, his involvement with the Azerbaijan Commerce Committee’s theft of oil, both Iraq wars, and his work with the Carlyle Group.

 Dissolve the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and let the NSA again resume its role as the leader of the intelligence community.

 Repeal the Patriot Act and the NDAA and dissolve the office of Homeland Security.

 End the NSA surveillance of Americans through Cisco routers, Intel processors, I-phones, Microsoft software, Google spying, Facebook spying, and network broadcasting of subliminal programming.

 Audit and dissolve DARPA, the Defense Research Advanced Research Projects Agency, where the technology for surveillance and weaponized information systems are developed.

 Audit and dissolve In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s form of DARPA, that uses the SAIC (Science Applications International Corporation) as its industrial application arm.

 End the Highlands Forum (Group) that tells DARPA and In-Q-Tel what to focus their research on.

 End the Council on Foreign Relations because it is the policy maker for the military industrial complex of America and keeps America entangled in continuous war and conflict. It is another home for globalism like the United Nations.

 Audit the Economic Stabilization Fund and then end the CIA’s control of the ESF returning control to the Treasury Department.

 Seize the assets of Barrick Gold Corporation and prosecute the company for theft and gold laundering.

 Return the assets stolen from USSR satellite countries that Bush Sr. and Henry Kissinger orchestrated. Prosecute the entire Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce (Dick Cheney, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Brent Scowcroft, James Baker, Lloyd Bentsen, Richard Armitage, and Richard Perle).

 Dissolve Obama’s ISIS mercenaries and end the fake war on terrorism.

 Rescind Obama’s additions to the National Defense Authorization Act and his executive orders that consolidate presidential powers that establish control over Americans that bypass existing U.S. laws.

 Try Obama and Clinton for war crimes for bombing seven sovereign nations without congressional approval.

 Investigate George Bush Jr.’s involvement with the second Iraq war and the false flag events of 911.

 Investigate, audit, and close the CIA. Audit all companies that are alleged to have been started with CIA funds and seize their assets.

 Establish new laws that prevent U.S. intelligence operatives from working for international intelligence agencies.

 Stop using privately owned intelligence agencies for U.S. governmental contracts.

 Establish new laws that prevent U.S. intelligence personnel and government regulators from working for companies that they previously monitored and regulated.

 Seize the stolen gold that the CIA holds and launders through Barrick Gold, CIA banks, the Zurich gold repository, and the U.S. Federal Reserve System and central banks throughout the world.

 Seize all CIA offshore accounts.

 Release the stolen CIA funds George Soros and Leo Wanta acquired through currency manipulation in Russia.

 Return the CIA stolen gold to its country of origin: Spain, China, Germany, France, Russia, Japan and the other countries it was taken from.

 Audit gold throughout the world and establish a new base-line for gold commodities worldwide.

 Streamline U.S. intelligence and stop contracting with transnational, global, corporations.

 Trump as Defender of the Spirit of America

 These suggestions are a beginning and can only be accomplished through great effort and sacrifice. America is in a Second American Revolution and Donald Trump is our George Washington, who was himself a reluctant president who took the job because of the deplorable conditions of his time.

 Washington was a seasoned soldier who had led the first charge of the French and Indian War and had two horses shot out from underneath him during the battle but continued on to victory. Afterwards, he found nine bullet holes in his hat and clothes. Trump is similarly on his third horse, having defeated the many Republican contenders and then defeated Queen Hillary, who already had put the crown upon her own head. Now, the many bullets that Clapper, Comey, and Brennan have aimed at him have come close and put holes in his clothes but have not injured him.

 Trump is being protected and inspired by the same spirit that inspired our founders who “put their lives on the line” for the country they loved. And like those founders, Trump envisions an America where the tenets of the U.S. Constitution are worth fighting for to establish freedom and American liberties. A New American Revolution is upon us and the minutemen have come out in force to elect Donald Trump as our commander and chief in the war on globalism that wishes to crush America.

 May President Trump be granted the strength, courage and wisdom that filled George Washington, even in his darkest days in Valley Forge. May that same spirit of Columbia that inspired our founders to create a free and just America, also guide and bless our new president, the leader of the battle to take back America.

Thank you very much, Doreen.

798,"The Franklin child prostitution ring allegations began in June 1988 in Omaha, Nebraska and attracted significant public and political interest until late 1990, when separate state and federal grand juries concluded that the allegations were unfounded and the ring was a ""carefully crafted hoax.""[1][2]

In 1988, authorities looked into allegations that prominent citizens of Nebraska, as well as high-level U.S. politicians, were involved in a child prostitution ring.[3] Alleged abuse victims were interviewed, who claimed that children in foster care were flown to the East Coast of the United States to be sexually abused at ""bad parties"".[4] The claims primarily centered on Lawrence E. King Jr., who ran the now defunct Franklin Community Federal Credit Union in Omaha, Nebraska, and alleged that the ring was ""a cult of devil worshipers involved in the mutilation, sacrifice and cannibalism of numerous children"".[3][5] Numerous conspiracy theories evolved, claiming that the alleged abuse was part of a widespread series of crimes including devil worship, cannibalism, drug trafficking, and CIA arms dealing.[3]

The Nebraska State Foster Care Review Board submitted the results of a two-year investigation into the alleged physical and sexual abuse of foster children to the Executive Board of the Nebraska Legislature, who were investigating reports of child sexual abuse linked to the credit union. After investigation, a grand jury in Douglas County, where Omaha, Nebraska is situated, determined the abuse allegations were baseless, describing them as a ""carefully crafted hoax"" and indicting two of the original accusers on perjury charges.[1] The grand jury suspected that the false stories originated from a fired employee of Boys Town, who might have ""fueled the fire of rumor and innuendo"" because of personal grudges.[1] A federal grand jury also concluded that the abuse allegations were unfounded and indicted 21-year-old Alisha Owen, an alleged victim, on eight counts of perjury. Owen served 4-1/2 years in prison.[6] Separately, the federal grand jury indicted multiple officers of the credit union for embezzlement of funds, including King.[1][2]

Historian Philip Jenkins explored how cases such as the Franklin allegations can acquire credibility, even if they lack any credibility inherently, when reported in various media in a credible voice.[3] He also explored how such allegations can be seized on by political opportunists for their own purposes.[3]",mainstream,M1d2e4,pizzagate
820,"“Post‐truth” became a social fact in 2016. Named “Word of the Year” by Oxford Dictionaries (and nominated for similar recognition by the American Dialect Society), “post‐truth” means (according to the former) “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.” We offer this definition not to sanction this binary or declare the self‐evidence of so‐called objective facts but rather to indicate the imperative of turning anthropological attention to the issue of what counts as objectivity, fact, and truth, and to how power shapes and is related to the uptake of truth claims.1 For anthropologists, truth and facts have long been complicated notions, at least since the ethnographic turn. While we are deeply troubled by Trumpism's attempt to adjudicate truth‐claims explicitly based on particular interests, views of the world, and power, not to mention ego, an intervention that reconsecrates the singularity and unassailability of “objective fact,” “truth,” and science against what are now called “alternative facts” would gloss over the multiplicity of concerns over knowledge production and inequality that have been at the forefront of critical scholarship, as well as perhaps misrecognize how we got to this contemporary upside‐down place. At the same time, given the larger social transformations underway that signal a turn toward both denial of myriad forms of social facts and evidence (such as racism and climate change) and a corresponding “re‐naturing” movement, where innateness and fundamentalist logics divorced from a serious engagement with context and substantiation are increasingly mobilized as central explanations for everything from ecological devastation to diverse women's underrepresentation in technology, it is crucial to not give up on what Hannah Arendt calls “factual truths.” In other words, showing the importance of society in the interpretation and making of facts does not, in turn, demand that all facts be recognized as equally valid, robust, corroborated, and—dare we say—true.2 It is crucial not to conflate the assertion that social groups and societal frames shape knowledge production (that facts are made meaningful through collectivities) with the contention that all knowledge claims are up for grabs and relativistic, thus leading to the problem of false equivalences—where, say, structural racism and reverse racism are framed as “equal facts,” just on “opposite sides.” It is precisely because of this tension (the importance of holding onto both sociality and facts), combined with calling out the powerful's manipulation of truth (ironically, in the name of the marginalized), that we convened this American Anthropologist Vital Topics Forum, which includes the pieces collected here and this introduction. To frame our intervention, we believe that bringing together Emile Durkheim's concept of “social facts” and Hannah Arendt's notion of “factual truths” might be a productive way to think through the stakes and the tensions of the particular moment. In addition, placing Durkheim and Arendt in the same analytical frame orients our intervention around the themes of truth, politics, power, and society, and thus links productively with the minoritized, feminist, postcolonial, and critical race and ethnic studies scholarship that has been so crucial in providing the tools to conduct an anthropological excavation of presentist hierarchies and exclusions. In this time of “post‐truth” and “alternative facts,” what can an anthropological approach—or rather, a range of anthropological approaches—contribute to our shared understandings of this moment, the nature of our collectivities, and our current conceptualizations of knowledge and authority? In this quandary of a moment, we turn to critical scholarship in anthropology and beyond. In particular, we want to recognize the trenchant research, especially from minority, feminist, and postcolonial critiques, that has transformed the social sciences and humanities and that has demonstrated that power, hierarchy, and location centrally shape what gets represented as rational, unencumbered knowledge (see, among others, Abu‐Lughod 1992; Gal 2003; Gupta and Ferguson 1997; Haraway 1988; Harding 1993; Rosaldo 1989; Spillers 1987). Put bluntly, such scholarship has helped us see that the “unmarkedness” of particular viewpoints, stances, and/or people—especially those of normative, Western white maleness—regularly allows them to stand in for universalizing truth. This collection, similarly, offers a multifaceted exploration, attentive to inequality and power, of the nature and politics of social facts that does not turn its back on the very situated knowledge productions that have long helped us to diagnose clashing conceptualizations of time, space, values, and ideologies, and to clarify what might be at stake in these divergent conceptualizations, given uneven fields of power and influence. These contributions to this American Anthropologist Vital Topics Forum think through and problematize notions of truth and facticity from various angles and topics, representing an engaged anthropological effort to show us not only how we got here but also, perhaps, where we are going.

This introduction, as well as many of the essays in this forum, use Durkheim's (1965) notion of “social facts” to understand collectively generated beliefs, values, and practices that in turn shape institutions and common‐sense rules; these social facts not only transcend individuals and exert social control but also can be irrational, illogical, and dysfunctional, no matter how “factual” they are understood and experienced to be. Durkheim used “social facts” to analyze everything from suicide to economic and currency systems, and Carolyn Rouse, in this forum, uses this concept to highlight “the conviction that liberal bias is tainting the academy.” With this move, we see how the concept and methodology of “social facts” can help us understand the seemingly nonsensical, contradictory, or unsupported assertions that underlie arguments for Muslim bans (based as they are on redeployments of the racist and Orientalist logics that allowed the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II), or the view that racial victimization of whites is prevalent. To understand such increasingly normative discourses in the Trump era, it is crucial to attend to the formations and underpinnings of the social facts that have produced such strongly affective logics and worldviews. We also recognize that the analyses and accounts that explain “why Trump” and how we came to this place of upended norms and crises of expectations (at least from a relatively mainstream and privileged perspective, where Trumpism elicited a surprise that, in hindsight, seems unwarranted) have often misrecognized many of the underlying issues that produced Trumpism in the first place. For instance, one such resistance to Trumpism has been the strategy of reducing the deeply felt “social facts” that underpin a variety of conservative, populist, reactionary, and/or neoliberal social movements to simply misguided “opinion,” whereas the critiques of Trumpism occupy the mantle of truth (i.e., science doesn't care about your opinion). The issue is not so much that there are not important differences with regard to truth and the importance of scientific evidence but rather that such proclamations sidestep the serious engagement with these social movements and worldviews as social facts, not to mention “our own” complicity and a broader analysis of the larger social orders and norms that have co‐constituted us all, albeit unevenly. In this context of intense social contestation, and quandary, it is crucial to come back to Durkheimian “social facts.” As we have described, and as Carol Greenhouse astutely reminds us, Durkheimian social facts have to pass the society test; they are shaped by collectivities, cultural values, and worldviews, and, as such, they can produce both cohesion and coercion. Deploying Durkheim in the contemporary moment reminds us that because “alternative facts” may still be social facts, we need to take seriously what they index about society. As Durkheim (1965, 3) explains, social facts are a “category of facts with very distinctive characteristics: it consists of ways of acting, thinking, and feeling, external to the individual, and endowed with a power of coercion, by reason of which they control him.” Given the social nature of facts, as Greenhouse argues, it is crucial to contextualize and analyze how hierarchy, authority, and various interests shape (and fracture) shared knowledge, “the idea of the public,” and the possibility of organic solidarity. Debates over truth are also struggles over the public interest and “holding political authority to account.” At the same time, because Durkheimian social facts do not distinguish between facts and “alternative facts,” they do not have a direct bearing on contestations and adjudications over veracity in politics; thus it is important to turn to Hannah Arendt to think through the differential stakes emerging from, say, what Sandra Harding might term “strong” facts versus persuasive opinions that serve the interests of strong men. The present demands that we take steps beyond “social constructionism” to engage simultaneously with how claims to truth are continually shaped by power and politics, and with how not all facts are equally validated. A generation after Nazism reached its peak, Arendt continued to worry about the difficulty of “factual truth surviving the onslaught of power” because the powerful, in exercising their interests and “right of dominion,”3 not only dispute and suppress certain facts but also actively “transform” “unwelcome factual truths … into opinions,” as though “the fact of Germany's support of Hitler” was not a “matter of historical record but a matter of opinion” (Arendt 1967, 49–51). Because contestations over truth and facts are always shaped by power and politics, she recognized both the importance of holding onto the “common and commonly recognized reality” that helps to frame and structure “our bearings in the real world” and the problem of asserting false equivalences and the decontextualized substitution of lies for truth (51, 78). She warned, however, that “since the liar is free to fashion his ‘facts’ to fit the profit and pleasure, or even the mere expectations, of his audience, the chances are that he will be more persuasive than the truthteller” (70; emphasis added).4 Perhaps even more crucially, Arendt recognized that what is at stake in these powerful inversions and “modern political lies,” driven by the “interests of men,” is that they can become “so big that they require a complete rearrangement of the whole factual texture —the making of another reality, as it were, into which they will fit without seam, crack, or fissure” (49, 74; emphasis added). In other words, “organized lying” and the “modern manipulation of facts” require the bending of the very social and historical context to fit the lie, thus upturning the larger historical and factual fabric in which factual truths are situated, rendering it difficult to make the necessary distinctions between lies and facts, between opinions and larger historical records and social contexts (50, 74). Adam Hodges gives us an example of this process in delineating the triadic nature of right‐wing populism, which pits “the people” against both a particular elite and a scapegoated and often foreign but always dangerous Other (which this elite is accused of “coddling”). This triadic model of populism, then, configures the facts of exclusion, power, and access such that the only solutions are ones that would replicate dynamics of social exclusion and inequality that are factual truths (now threatened in this depiction of the world). Such categorizations collapse and obscure differences and similarities across and among multiple groupings. Moreover, such a shaping of social facts and the content and the contexts of factual truths distorts the very processes upon which robust knowledge production depends. When “reality” is constantly made to conform to “nonfacts,” it becomes near impossible to trace, locate, and/or build on (not to mention nuance and contest) prior knowledge production, historical interpretations, and evidence. Simultaneously, uneven power relations themselves become too murky to ascertain as the “rearrangement of the whole factual texture” unravels the ability to locate, situate, and analyze both knowledge and power. What and who is dangerous, criminal, or even powerful becomes difficult to assess, and easily upended. Arendt's seemingly dystopian analysis well describes our current political moment, and points to the urgency with which anthropologists and others might want to approach facts and truth, not from a relativistic perspective, but rather by acknowledging that some claims (like reverse racism) are not true and some facts (like the Holocaust and structural racism) are, to quote a reviewer, “clearly true and right.” Arendt's warning provokes us to simultaneously recognize that while knowledge is always shaped in some way by society and that the very notion of truth is a complex one, it is also crucial not to let go of what's at stake in truth and politics, given that some facts—and the collectivities to which they are vitally connected—are particularly vulnerable. Suffice it to say that while we recognize that worldviews, faith, and emotion shape, in some way, all knowledge production, empirical and otherwise (even Arendt admitted that the powerful might try to wrangle three to equal two), we take to heart Arendt's cautionary tale that not all facts (whether they be “social facts,” “factual truths,” and/or “rational truths”) are equal.

AND YET, THE IMPORTANCE OF QUESTIONING “WHEN TRUTH WAS TRUTH” In the context of post‐truth/alternative‐facts politics, many social critics point to our inability to participate in constructive discourse or produce (tentative) common ground based on shared knowledge as one of the central threats to our democracy. They harken back to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's oft‐quoted phrase “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion but not to his own facts”5 to convey the dire predicament that without some basic level of trust in shared facts—in which we may recognize Arendt's factual truths—it is becoming increasingly difficult for society to come together to confront and solve the greatest socioeconomic problems of our day. Without a modicum of common bearing or shared reality, it becomes extremely difficult to even agree on what these problems are, not to mention acknowledge their very existence. As Alexander Dent points out, the monologic tendency of authoritarian discourse that permeates so much of contemporary US public life—from politics to corporate governance—is to conceptualize public discourse as a site for opposite sides to argue vociferously for their own truths. Such monologism, moreover, necessarily works to obscure the other voices that animate alternate views and perspectives. Yet, despite the seeming panacea of shared facts—if only we could all come together on a “commonly recognized reality”—it is simultaneously crucial to question the self‐evidence of facts. (Remember that Arendt also urges us to recognize the vulnerability of facts and how political interest may inform which facts are attended to and shored up, and which backgrounded or contested.) Circling back to Moynihan is instructive here. While he deserves credit for recognizing the importance of social facts in public discourse as potential sites of agreement and social amelioration, he was also the author of the infamous “Moynihan report,” The Negro Family: The Case for National Action (1965). Purportedly in the hopes of inspiring “liberal” policy action, Moynihan problematically diagnosed that it was “black family structure” (not white supremacy) that produced the greatest impediment to equality. In this case, one could certainly argue that a key advocate of facts in turn mobilized long‐standing facts and assumptions about African Americans produced in a racist society. The construction of blame and the assumption of pathology in minority women heads of households continue to be understood as facts in mainstream society, leaving intact as the standard the exclusionary and narrow understandings of family, gender, race, and class based on the experiences and lens of the privileged. As Carolyn Rouse conveys, alternative facts have always framed “factual” knowledge production about African Americans.6 Conversely, as James Baldwin (1998a, 1998b) brilliantly observes in “On Being ‘White’ … and Other Lies” and “The Black Boy Looks at the White Boy,” whiteness itself is also a powerful fiction built on the disavowal and debasement of the diversity of life and the humanity of others, one that traffics in innocence and an investment in privilege. This context, then, gives us the wherewithal to pause and recognize the importance of refusing to romanticize a time when “truth was truth,” as if there existed a moment of pristine objectivity when all knowledge production from multiple social categories and locations was equally valued. Specifically, as Rouse argues, the very notion that bias is new—and, in particular, that “liberal bias” within universities is a problem, and the solution for this “post‐truth” moment is to double down on “objective truth‐seeking” through the methodology of “free‐speech free‐for‐alls”—fundamentally misunderstands not only the purpose of universities but also the very nature of facts and truths. Social groups and power shape all facts and truths, and truths and facts depend upon their historical moment, even as they may be assembled in such a way as to obscure that tendency. As Michael Partis argues, social groups can construct and frame “reverse racism” into a fact precisely because neoconservatism, neoliberalism, and white supremacy worked hard to delink racism from race. Deracinating racism from race, just like acting as if power is separate from facts, allows powerful interests to disembed racialized hierarchies from racialized groups and categories, and correspondingly, to powerfully claim their social fact as truth. It seems that Belgium invades Germany here, to reference Arendt's example of a social fact that is true but might become vulnerable to powerful opponents, making scholarship like Partis's and the waves of social activism that are currently contesting this version of the facts all the more urgent and vital. In a related vein, Karen‐Sue Taussig makes the point that “critically engag[ing] with scientific evidence” (for example, recognizing the evidence around climate change) does not necessitate the reification of “scientific truth as some form of unquestionable authority,” nor does it demand the redeployment of the problematic dichotomies between objectivity and subjectivity, culture and truth, fact and opinion. In fact, situating scientific knowledge production, analyzing the various lenses and cultural assumptions that imbue it with power, and questioning the role of power in its truth‐claims does not, in turn, mean that anthropologists and other social analysts of science devalue or deny “the basic legitimacy” of scientific knowledge and evidence. One could certainly argue that such a situated approach works to make scientific knowledge production more accountable, locatable, and robust. One difficulty, of course, is that scientific knowledge production, like many dominant discourses, has often refused to recognize the extent of the roles that faith, authority, and power play in constructing scientific legitimacy. Undoubtedly, demanding absolute deference to scientific expertise has generated a backlash, but the solution is not to engage in denialism of scientific evidence. Instead, recognizing and investigating the imbrication of politics and truth, even or perhaps especially that which appears most authoritative and expert, can help us avoid dead‐end binaries of these sorts. Both strict adherence and total denialism are part and parcel of the absolutist, binary thought that anthropology seeks to contest, contextualize, and move beyond. In this endeavor, it is important, as Sherry Ortner reminds us, to question the taken‐for‐granted assumptions and social facts in anthropological knowledge production itself. In her analysis of the coproduction of capitalism and patriarchy (and their embodiment in Trump's body of work, so to speak), she asks anthropology to recognize its own ideological boundaries and interpretive lenses that separate the understanding and analysis of “capitalism” from “kinship/patriarchy.” Going beyond simply claiming the mutual constitution of capitalism and patriarchy, she argues that the very “organizational forms” of capitalism are structured upon “patriarchal relations of power.” Similarly, Susana Narotzky reminds us that just as it is important to question anthropological models and ways of knowing, it is equally crucial to problematize economic logics and policies that attempt to make worlds from a priori , bounded frames rather than actually existing lives and heterogeneities. Her contribution explores the connections and disjunctures that characterize the relationship between economic policy and everyday understandings of those policies and how they affect people and their livelihoods across southern Europe. The social facts of how economies work are vastly different when viewed through the lens of the people who live within them as opposed to those who study them through the so‐called objective lens of economics. Social facts are perhaps best and most robustly analyzed and understood through the processual feedback loop from field and text, from diverse life projects and approaches/models of the world. Narotzky's case also highlights that not all witnesses have the same access to and claims on truth: expertise comes in various forms. Power shapes whose version of truth matters, even when the facts seem to be obvious and taken for granted. Anthropologists can contribute, in cases like this, to new formations of social facts, tugging the factual fabric into new forms that recognize social and economic inequalities and (perhaps) enable new forms of social action. But what of the various forms and manifestations of facts? This moment seems to have put a new spin on the pitting of quantitative against qualitative facts. This opposition, another of those absolutist binaries that obscures so much of the activity of knowledge production, will be familiar to cultural and linguistic anthropologists who work with ethnographic and qualitative data but have perhaps found their work questioned or dismissed because it lacks numbers, statistics, or “hard facts.” Hilary Dick points out this opposition in policymaking based on statistical patterns (that recognize, for instance, the much lower rates of crime committed by immigrants than by nonimmigrants in the United States) versus policymaking that draws on a few spectacular cases of criminality, which are in turn made a part of spectacles to “build the wall” and mark entire categories of people as criminals. As Dick shows, these diverse takes on the “truth” about the border wall—what it is or would be and the nature of its potential or real impacts on people's lives—are rooted in collectivities that differ in how they see world and the people who populate it. These differences, moreover, are built on diverse types of evidence whose assessment as valid or true involves a reckoning that anthropologists, who still struggle with what counts as objectivity (the “are we or aren't we scientists?” question), should recognize.

HYPERINEQUALITY AND THE INSTABILITIES OF THE CONTEMPORARY MOMENT To contextualize this set of anthropological interventions on social facts, it is crucial to think through the specificities of the contemporary moment—from the conditions of hyperinequality to climate change denial, from nostalgia for normative social orders to authoritarianism and new forms of un/accountability. These changing conditions set the stage for the question: To what extent is this moment different? If the structural architectures that have long constituted and reproduced racism, sexism, ethnocentrism, classism, and heterosexism are all alternative facts and myths with enduring powers of persuasion and naturalization, what makes the present seem so markedly post‐truth? Perhaps one of the key differences—that is, the rub—is that the powerful themselves have explicitly and nakedly taken up the mantle of deconstructing “truth” not to destabilize presentist hierarchies (an undertaking anthropologists have long embraced). Rather, they have seized on conditions of hyperinequality to mobilize an avalanche of discontent among sectors of the downwardly mobile in a way that misrecognizes the key causes of their predicament and scapegoats those at the margins of social hierarchies. This Molotov cocktail—long‐standing hierarchies and othering discourses fueled by precarity and resentment—helps to solidify the terrifying and increasingly “common sense” rhetoric that a permissive social order has allowed the formerly marginalized to take advantage of the system such that recipients of undeserving handouts triumph over the normative and the hardworking. Yet, this imagined social order appears to be the manifestation of decades of conservative thought, where reverse discrimination is the central problematic and is wrongly asserted as the new, uncovered “hidden truth” and where minoritized communities collude with corrupt government elites and officials to promote undeserving “special interests” at the expense of white working‐class men who have become “strangers in their own land” (Hochschild 2016; see also Hodges in this collection). If this is the social context, then “restoring” a prior social order means privileging the security of white men and “their” families. As Arendt foretold, if the social fabric has been retrofitted to bolster the lie of, say, reverse racism, then it comes as no surprise that nonfacts must necessarily substitute for the larger social context. Further, if reverse discrimination is the imagined order, yet social facts overwhelmingly point to a different reality—one where racism, nativism, and large‐scale disinvestment in infrastructure and the social safety net continue to dismantle the life chances of minority communities even more than those who were previously protected (yet who are also experiencing significant decline)—then social facts are themselves wrong. Is the result a massive reversal, suspicion, and revision of “the truth”? (Rouse makes the similar argument that the problematic social fact of “liberal bias,” like reverse discrimination, inverts the social context to privilege normative and conservative thought and practice.) What are the social ramifications of deploying narratives of unfairness and elite advantage not only for specific, personal claims to power but also to reverse and undermine the very struggles and gains of minoritized social movements in the past half century? What if the social fact of white male downward mobility—a struggle that has singularly captured the contemporary white populist movement—is so bound up with racist and revisionist understandings of history that it becomes impossible to “tell the truth”? Such an insight also helps us to think about how gender and sexism fuel and construct patriarchal capitalism, to go back to Ortner's phrase. Enacting overt and subtle forms of dominance over women, from speech acts to sexual one‐upmanship, is the requirement for upward mobility in a workplace that is premised on competitive masculinity. In this light, it is not surprising that sexism, and gendered and sexual normativity, so tightly sutured onto patriarchal rituals of (bread)winning, become a central arena through which struggles against downward mobility are enacted. Not surprisingly, Trump actively captured and mobilized the discontent and energy channeled toward discrimination (in particular, sexism and racism) as signs of his capitalist success, his superiority, and his willingness to fight for the place of white men—presented in his discourse simply and continually as “us” and “you”—in the American hierarchy. In times of hyperinequality and precarity, it comes as little surprise that certain social categories might be incentivized to double down on the invidious distinctions that have long characterized and assured workplace mobility and success. Would not classes of white men, for example, for whom racial and gendered monopoly propelled and protected upward mobility and status, hold on to and exacerbate sexism and racism when age‐old class guarantees feel destabilized? At the same time, the dismissing of social justice movements centered on racial inequality is widespread, as have been calls to move away from a politics of identity. What is the future of race and racism in the United States when racist statements, people, and organizations are entering public discourse in ways unseen for decades? What are its roots in the past, and how can we understand current debates and circumstances as linked to earlier iterations and conflicts? Michael Partis historically contextualizes our contemporary debates about race and racism, looking back to reactions to the civil rights era and beyond to argue that race in the United States, particularly for African Americans, is most fittingly understood as caste. The consistent and pernicious positioning of African Americans as outside of the mainstream, as dangerous and exceptional, is part and parcel of white supremacy as a structural force and not just a political ideology. This recognition produces a different fabric of truth, a powerful way to complicate dominant public discourses that would deny it. Indeed, contemporary political discourses are potent sites where social inequality is being constructed and shaped. Hilary Dick argues that the border wall (and Trump's ongoing commitment to building it) is a potent metaphor for social, economic, and political barriers, but also a vital tool for enacting difference and marginalizing those situated as being on the “wrong” side of it. As an instance of political spectacle, talk about building the wall, whether as part of political rallies or hurled at particular individuals identified as “Mexican” (and thus apparently on the “wrong side” of the wall), helps to produce what Dick calls “migrant criminality,” aligning groups of people as inherently “legal” or “illegal.” Migration itself becomes a sign and enactment of illegality, even as the deep history of migration in the United States is obscured in the collective understandings that such talk produces. The wall makes visible the different collectivities that recognize starkly different truths; it also illuminates the hierarchies that shape the powerful inequalities underpinning certain people's ability to deem others “illegal” and “criminal” and therefore subject to harsh treatment under the law. Thus, ongoing inequalities take on new force within current debates over access to resources, inclusion and exclusion from the body politic, and the conceptualization of particular categories of people as winning or losing. Such deep differences in the fabric of social truths point to the nature of situated knowledge and the importance in recognizing it, as well as the ways in which objectivity itself can be questioned but not discarded. Haraway and Harding, among other feminist scholars, have urged us toward more rigorous versions of objectivity, precisely through the recognition of knowledge production as situated. Time, or the particularity of any given historical moment, is a crucial element of such situatedness, such that examining the debates and discourses that led up to and followed the election on November 8, 2016, can tell us a lot about “post‐truth,” the state of social facts, and the role of “the free press.” It is just as important to the current moment to understand not just what is occurring and why, but also how. Adam Hodges's analysis of the nature of Trump's populism provides situatedness and also illuminates one of the ways in which it functions so robustly. We should also ask: what are the interactional modes, genres, and stances that enable fact, truth, and evidence to be so differently conceptualized and deployed with varying degrees of efficacy? Whence do they arise and from which longer historical lineages do they emerge? Alexander Dent illustrates the authoritarian and not just populist nature of how the current US presidential administration works, which grounds authority in the speaking subject rather than external sources. “Believe me,” says authoritarianism. Dent describes the types of Rabelaisian reversals of fact and process currently being enacted by those in power as “ludic authoritarianism,” a playful, uproarious mode that pokes fun at external sources of knowledge and authority as it continually situates itself authoritatively. Crucially, this authoritarian discourse is not unique to this moment or its politics. Reagan indulged in moments of authoritarian self‐authorization, and corporate governance, as Dent exemplifies in Steve Jobs, shamelessly excludes and pokes fun at the truths and lives of those outside the circle of shared understanding. Dent's description of ludic authoritarianism illuminates how the processes that Arendt presents function, as it is one way in which factual truths become subverted, erased, or playfully inverted. This dynamic characterizes more than just politics right now, and we should be aware and wary of its processes and effect, as well as how it shapes what and how we understand the discourses of those in various positions of power. Meaning making itself is, of course, an ongoing process, always grounded in interactional dynamics as well as social hierarchies.7 At a moment when the very relationships between what is said and what is meant are extremely important but also frequently unclear, it is vital to illuminate the contextual nature of meaning‐making processes. Context may be interactionally as well as broadly defined, encompassing both what happens in face‐to‐face circumstances but also what might travel via television or radio, or within the so‐called Twittersphere. How can we reconcile contradictions among what is stated across different modalities, from Twitter to press conferences to closed‐door sessions? Whose statements carry weight while others are dismissed or ignored? In everyday conversations, speakers can be held accountable for the utterances they produce, a dynamic that until recently characterized political exchange as well.8 This may be a new social fact, an emerging change in how we assess and create truth and meaning, a moment when new standards about truth‐making and accountability are negotiated in the public sphere. Debenport outlines how the culturally shaped achievements of secrecy, truth, and revelation, as both states and processes, shape the spread of information but also delimit who can speak when, about what, and to whom. Social facts—such as authority, access, and power—are formed through such processes of veiling and revealing, which in turn reflect but may also impact hierarchies of power and social standing. To be able to speak a truth or not are capabilities deeply tied to one's place within any hierarchy, a social fact that itself bears scrutiny, as accusations of “fake news!” and “just opinion!” are efforts to silence as much as to be heard. Indeed, amid pizza‐parlor conspiracies and calls from certain quarters that there is a so‐called deep state at work, secrecy and its unveiling are vital parts of how truth is conceptualized and debated, and must be approached.

What can the application of anthropological perspectives lend to understanding the current “post‐truth” moment? Given our long‐standing critical debate about (and problematization of) facts, especially their situatedness and the charged nature of their production and representations, anthropologists are perhaps uniquely situated to link scholarly debate to political discourse, processes that generate inequality, and uneven power relations. In the spirit of recognizing that the very term “fact” is a “delicate matter,” to borrow from Clifford Geertz's (1996) After the Fact , in this American Anthropologist Vital Topics Forum, we (re)turn to social facts. We convened this forum to address pressing questions that currently animate scholarly, political and often personal debates, and as Carol Greenhouse astutely states, to think with social facts to “make visible … a fundamental breach of solidarity.” What are the links between (post‐)truth, critique, skepticism, and various crises of representation, from countering universalizing knowledge to challenging essentialism? What are the ramifications when progressive academic critiques of (often colonialist) “objective realities” get thrown back at us, with very different assumptions of power? What are the connections, if any, between post‐truth and partial truths? How can we engage with the spurious versions of reality that have contributed to this moment of risk, revision, and revulsion? Given anthropology's long‐standing analysis and critique of “the taken for granted,” not to mention the questioning of what counts as objectivity (given the relative influence of the powerful to lay claim to “the truth”), we hope to incite and provoke an examination of the powerful workings of truth and politics in an age of hyperinequality. We hope that you will join us in what is hopefully just a preliminary investigation into these and other important questions.",mainstream,M10535,pizzagate
514,"As the old expression goes “there’s a special place in hell” for pedophiles. But hell for some infants, toddlers, children, and teenagers might be a little country called Norway. That’s because the country just seized the largest amount of child pornography in the country’s history! A whopping 150 terabytes were confiscated, the equivalent of over 35,000 child-porn DVDs!

The search began when one 22-year-old man was being investigated for having sex with a 14-year-old. The investigation led to the man’s cell phone, where authorities quickly realized he had been in contact with other suspected child rapists. The network of rapists led the Norwegian authorities to create a team of 25 officers, from various departments, to work together on the ever-expanding case called “Operation Darkroom.”

According to The Nordic Page, “The material has led to charges of sexual intercourse and rape of children from infancy to 15 years, serious trafficking and production, storage and sharing of material depicting sexual abuse of children, and luring of children to show off or sending nude photos or masturbate over the internet. Police also found examples of offenders who have planned atrocities against their own children with other men.”

The investigation quickly led to arrests of, “51 people, all men, are so far involved in the case. 24 of them come from Hordaland and Sogn og Fjordane. 26 come from other areas of Norway, from Southeast to Finnmark in the north. Among the accused offenders, there is also one Swedish national. Two politicians, one Labor politician from Oslo and a former national Progress Party (FrP) politician from Eastern Norway are involved in the case.” One is also a kindergarten teacher, and four of the 51 arrested were perpetrators in the video evidence collected.

Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg said of the arrests, “I think this is incredibly painful. It is painful to hear and see stories about abuse against young babies, and the fantasies of abuse against young children. You do not need to be a mother to think that this is painful to hear, all people with empathy and contact with young children know that this type of abuse leaves marks for life, says Solberg.”

While it doesn’t appear that the Norwegian media has been in any way dismissive of the operation and the charges involving high-level government officials, the same cannot be said of the American mainstream media. Throughout the first and second weeks of December, since the mainstream media first reported that Edgar Maddison Welch, of Salisbury, N.C., fired a shot inside the Comet Ping Pong Pizzaria in Washington, DC, the mainstream media has been declaring the so-called child-sex “Pizzagate” child-sex ring, a false conspiracy theory based on lies.

Welch was reportedly searching for child-sex slaves inside Comet Ping Pong based on stories he’d read online involving pedophilia and the Washington elite. Ironically, and without any real investigative, Chris Hanson style journalism being conducted, the mainstream media and its pundits have declared all the claims found in the conspiracy theory to be false, lies constructed by “fake news”. In fact, The Washington Post simply declared, “None of them were true.” That may, indeed, be the case. But if it can happen in Norway, with Norwegian lawmakers, it can certainly happen in the United States, and all such claims must be investigated thoroughly by properly trained police officers with the tools necessary to uncover such deviant sex crimes involving children. We applaud the Norwegian authorities for being unafraid, vigilant, and thorough in their investigations of child-sex rings. May justice be swift.",conspiracy,C0384c,pizzagate

NOT JUST NUKES -- “North Korea’s Trump card -- chemical weapons targeting American troops,” by McClatchy’s Stuart Leavenworth: “[T]here’s at least one significant reason why U.S. military leaders would be reluctant to carry out such a strike: North Korea would surely retaliate, and this retaliation could include use of chemical weapons. ‘Nuclear weapons are not the only threat,’ said Kelsey Davenport, director of non-proliferation policy for the Arms Control Association. ‘North Korea could respond to a U.S. attack using chemical weapons. That would be devastating.’ North Korea is known to have compiled large stockpiles of nerve agents such as sarin and VX. It could fire these from hidden artillery and missile sites, targeting U.S. military bases in the region and cities such as Seoul and Tokyo.”

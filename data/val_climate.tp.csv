DT tax is designed to reduce DT output of greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide , a colorless and odorless incombustible gas , into DT atmosphere . DT tax is imposed with DT goal of environmental protection . A tax designed to mitigate or remove DT negative externalities of carbon emission , a carbon tax is a type of Pigovian tax . Carbon is found in every kind of hydrocarbon fuel ( including coal , petroleum , and natural gas ) and is released as DT harmful toxin carbon dioxide ( CO ) when this kind of fuel is burned . CO is DT compound primarily responsible for DT "" greenhouse "" effect of trapping heat within DT NNP 's atmosphere , and is , therefore , CD of DT primary causes of JJ NN . A carbon tax is RB referred to as a form of carbon pricing on greenhouse gas NNS where a fixed price is set by DT NN for carbon NNS in certain sectors . DT price is passed through from businesses to consumers . By increasing DT cost of greenhouse NNS , governments hope to curb consumption , reduce DT demand for fossil fuels , and push more companies toward creating environmentally - friendly substitutes . A carbon tax is a way for a NN to exert some control over carbon NNS without resorting to DT levers of a command economy , by which DT NN MD control DT means of production and manually halt carbon NNS . Any carbon found in manufactured products IN plastics WDT is not burned is not taxed . DT same applies to any CO WDT is permanently isolated from production and is not released into DT atmosphere . But DT tax is paid during DT upstream process , or when DT fuel or gas is extracted from DT NNP . Producers can then pass on DT tax to DT market by as much as PRP can . This , in turn , gives consumers a chance to reduce their own carbon footprints . Carbon taxes have been implemented in a number of NNS around DT NN . PRP take several different forms , but most amount to a straightforward rate of taxation per ton of hydrocarbon fuel used . DT first country to implement a carbon tax was Finland , in 1990 . DT levy currently stands at $ 24.39 dollars per ton of carbon . DT Finns were quickly followed by other Nordic NNS — Sweden and Norway both implemented their own carbon taxes in 1991 . Starting at a rate of $ 51 per ton of CO used in gasoline ( DT tax MD later decrease considerably ) , DT Norwegian tax is among DT most stringent in DT NN . Most forms of carbon taxation have been deployed successfully , but Australia 's failed attempt from 2012 - 2014 stands in stark contrast . DT minority Green party was able to broker DT carbon tax during a period of political stagnation in 2011 , but DT tax never garnered DT support of either of DT main parties in Australia , DT left - leaning Labor Party ( which reluctantly agreed to DT tax to form a NN with DT Greens ) and DT center - right Liberals , whose leader Tony Abbott spearheaded DT 2014 repeal . IN most JJ initiatives to combat NN NN , carbon taxes remain highly controversial ."

PRP was reported at DT NN IN Prince Harry gave a barefoot speech at DT Google NN retreat but celebs were criticised for using gas - guzzling private jets and superyachts to VB RB . Harry and Meghan are thought to have planned their bombshell retreat from frontline royal life at DT stunning Mille Fleurs home on Vancouver Island . But DT royal couple have been at DT heart of a secrecy row over who lent them DT luxury mansion . Harry and Meghan refused to say if PRP paid for their six - week stay or confirm who DT property belongs to . Moscow - born Mr Milner RB rented Mille Fleurs five NNS ago , but denies he now owns DT stunning pad . But neighbours claim DT holiday home is owned by a Russian billionaire . Mr Milner 's pal Canadian music producer David Foster RB has a home on Vancouver Island . DT Sun previously revealed Harry and Meghan asked neighbours to sign non-disclosure agreements before moving in for Christmas with baby Archie . DT Mille Fleurs home near Victoria , British Columbia , MD have cost more than £ 100,000 to rent . DT idyllic bolthole has stunning views and boasts eight bedrooms and two private beaches . CD local , who did not wish to be named , told DT Sun : “ I was very surprised to hear PRP were staying RB because PRP ’s always been a mystery about who actually owns PRP . "" PRP does n’t seem DT sort of place a royal couple MD VB . ” DT mystery over DT property ’s ownership is likely to raise concerns over DT couple ’s acquaintances as PRP seek “ financial independence ” . An estate agent who helped sell PRP in 2014 VBD DT JJ owner included a non-disclosure agreement as part of DT deal . He VBD DT buyer was neither Canadian nor American . DT complex purchasing method can help NNS hide their involvement . All of DT 27 properties on DT road are registered under a company called Towner Bay Country Club . PRP means buyers effectively just purchase shares in DT club , with their names not on any JJ paperwork . Mr Milner made a fortune when his investment firm DST NNP bought stakes in Facebook and Twitter with funding VBN to be from Kremlin - controlled companies . He has RB invested in a real estate venture co-owned by Donald NNP ’s son- in - law , Jared Kushner . When asked about Mille Fleurs , Mr Milner 's spokesman Paddy Harverson told DT Mail : "" Neither Yuri Milner nor any family member nor any entity affiliated with him or his family owns this property . "" He rented DT property five NNS ago for a brief period of NN . "" Harry and Meghan missed DT traditional royal Christmas with DT Queen"

Zhengyu Liu , professor of atmospheric and ocean sciences at DT University of Wisconsin , explains : “ Data from observation suggests IN DT NNP is cooling while DT physical data suggests DT complete opposite . ” Liu has been working with professors from JJ other academias to understand DT obvious cooling of DT NN : DT issue has been termed DT Holocene Temperature Conundrum ( HTC ) which is explained : “ A recent temperature reconstruction of JJ annual temperature shows Early Holocene warmth followed by a cooling trend through DT Middle to Late Holocene [ Marcott SA , et al. , 2013 , NNP 339( 6124):1198 –1201 ] . “ This JJ cooling is puzzling because PRP is opposite from DT expected and simulated JJ NN trend due to DT retreating NN sheets and rising atmospheric greenhouse gases . “ Our critical reexamination of this contradiction between DT reconstructed cooling and DT simulated NN points to potentially significant biases in both DT seasonality of DT proxy reconstruction and DT NN sensitivity of current NN models . ” “ Over DT last 10,000 NNS , Liu says , PRP VBP atmospheric carbon dioxide rose by 20 parts per million before DT 20th century , and DT massive NN sheet of DT Last Glacial Maximum has been retreating . “ These physical changes suggest IN , globally , DT annual mean JJ temperature should have continued to warm , even as regions of DT NN experienced cooling , such as during DT Little NNP Age in Europe between DT 16th and 19th centuries . ” DT myth perpetuated by alarmist NNS is IN EX is a 97 % consensus IN man-made NN NN is real and IN DT NNP is heating up . However , John Cook , NN scientist for DT UQ NNP NNP Institute ( GCI ) , released data from DT University of Queensland ( UQ ) WDT shows “ IN DT number of papers rejecting DT consensus on [ anthropogenic JJ NN ] is a vanishingly small proportion of DT published research . ” Alastair McEwan , acting pro-vice - chancellor of UQ defended DT college ’s claim IN EX is a scientific consensus , independently of Cook ’s findings : To discredit Cook , a NN was released in 2013 by climatologists WDT claimed Cook “ misrepresented DT views of most consensus NNS . ” This shows IN DT consensus WDT humans are DT sole cause of NN NN is actually only 0.3 % .

Tonsils are lumps of tissue on both sides of DT back of DT throat WDT help DT immune system protect DT body from infections . But sometimes infections are too much for DT tonsils to handle , and these fighters of infection become infected themselves . Infected tonsils VBP swollen and red , and have a yellow or white coating . A person with tonsillitis MD have a sore throat , fever , swollen glands in DT neck , and trouble swallowing . What Are DT Signs & Symptoms of Tonsillitis ? Inflamed tonsils look red and swollen , and MD be covered with a yellow or whitish coating or spots . Someone with tonsillitis MD have : • a sore throat , which can be mild to severe • white spots or pus on DT tonsils If PRP have symptoms of tonsillitis , call your doctor . Tonsillitis is usually caused by a Bacteria RB can cause PRP , most commonly group A streptococcus ( strep throat ) . Rarely , tonsillitis can be caused by something other than an infection . Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and examine your throat and neck . Your doctor MD use a soft cotton swab to gently collect a sample from your tonsils and DT back of your throat for testing . PRP 's important for your doctor to VB if are causing DT infection . If PRP have strep throat , PRP 'll need treatment withto kill DT bacteria . This will help PRP feel better and prevent other problems WDT can come from untreated strep throat . If your doctor prescribes antibiotics , be sure to follow DT directions carefully . Finish taking all DT medicine even if your symptoms VBP away and PRP feel better , or DT infection MD come back . If a strep test comes back negative , PRP 's probably a NN causing DT tonsillitis and antibiotics wo n't help . Just UH with a cold ( RB caused by a NN ) , PRP 'll have to take PRP easy for several days and let DT NN run its course . Rarely , if someone gets tonsillitis a lot , DT doctor or an otolaryngologist ( pronounced : oh - toe - lar - un - GA - luh - jist , a doctor who specializes in ear , nose , and throat problems ) MD recommend a tonsillectomy ( pronounced : tahn - suh - LEK - tuh - mee ) . This is a surgery to remove DT tonsils . Tonsillectomy used to be a common procedure , but now experts recommend watching and waiting because large tonsils often shrink on their own over NN . How Can I Feel Better ? VB plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids . PRP can take acetaminophen or ibuprofen to relieve any pain or discomfort . ( Do n't take aspirin or other products WDT contain aspirin , though , because these MD put PRP at risk of developing Reye syndrome , an illness WDT can have serious complications . ) Avoid smoking or anything WDT will irritate your throat . PRP 's best to drink lots of liquids . PRP MD prefer softer foods , IN applesauce , flavored gelatin , or NN cream . If PRP do n't feel IN eating , try drinking liquids WDT contain calories , such as fruit juices , milkshakes , and soups and broths . If PRP 're on antibiotics , PRP 's usually OK to return to school 24 hours after PRP start taking them if your fever is gone and PRP feel better . If PRP 're still feeling weak , tired , or achy , PRP MD be best to stay home for another day or two . Tonsillitis is contagious . This means PRP can VB PRP from someone else who has PRP . Sneezing and coughing can pass DT tonsillitis - causing NN or bacteria from CD person to DT next . To protect yourself from catching tonsillitis or to prevent passing PRP to somebody else : • Wash your hands well and often . • If someone in your household or a friend has tonsillitis , do n't use DT person 's cups , glasses , silverware , toothbrush , or other utensils . And if PRP have tonsillitis , keep your stuff separate and do n't share PRP with anyone . • Do n't kiss anyone until PRP 're completely over DT tonsillitis . • VB a JJ toothbrush after PRP feel better and are no longer contagious . When Should I Call DT Doctor ? Call your doctor right away if your condition gets worse ; for example , if PRP have a hard NN breathing or swallowing . RB talk to your doctor if your fever comes back or if PRP 're not feeling better in a couple of days ."

Cold , dry air is a common asthma trigger and can cause bad flare - ups . DT 's especially true for NNS who play winter sports and have exercise - induced asthma . Hot , humid air RB can be a problem . In some places , heat and sunlight combine with pollutants to create ground - level ozone . This kind of ozone can be a strong asthma trigger . Wet weather and windy weather can cause problems too . Wet weather encourages mold growth , and wind can blow mold and pollen through DT air . If PRP VBP weather plays a role in your child 's asthma , keep a diary of asthma symptoms and possible triggers and discuss them with your doctor . If pollen , mold , or other allergens make asthma symptoms worse , ask about allergy testing . How Can PRP Avoid Weather Triggers ? Once PRP VBP what kind of weather triggers asthma symptoms , try these tips to protect your child : • Watch DT forecast for pollen and mold counts plus other conditions ( extreme cold or heat ) WDT might affect your child 's asthma . • Make sure your child wears a scarf over DT mouth and nose when outside in very cold weather . • Keep windows closed at night to keep pollen and molds out . If PRP 's hot , use air conditioning , which cleans , cools , and dries DT air . • Keep your child indoors early in DT morning ( before 10 a.m. ) when pollen is at its highest . • Your child should n't mow DT lawn or rake leaves , and should be kept away from freshly cut grass and leaf piles . • Dry clothes in DT dryer ( hanging clothes or sheets to dry can allow mold or pollen to collect on them ) . • Make sure your child always has quick - relief medicine ( RB called rescue or fast - acting medicine ) on hand . Your child 's written asthma action plan should list weather triggers and ways to manage them , including any seasonal changes in medicine ."

NN NN , waning habitat will drive NN Researchers are n't clear yet about how DT novel NN began infecting NNS , but say PRP seems to have originated in bats , making PRP DT latest in a string of emerging human NN WDT spread from animals . NN and wildlife experts say PRP expect to see a rise in diseases transmitted among animals , plants and humans , and in particular , more frequent outbreaks in humans of diseases WDT come from animals . Such "" zoonotic "" diseases already make up DT majority of JJ infections in humans . But animals are n't to blame for DT increase in JJ outbreaks , according to Arizona NNP University virologist Arvind Varsani . Humans are . Varsani researches DT emergence of diseases around DT globe and he VBD two major factors likely to impact DT dynamics of NN spread are NN NN and changes in land use due to urbanization or agriculture . Both factors put animals under strain , forcing them to compete for resources in shrinking habitats and making them opportune hosts for zoonotic diseases , which more easily infect stressed animals . Shrinking suitable habitat amid urbanization and DT rapid expansion of agriculture RB cluster animals closer together with humans and domestic animals . DT allows DT viruses to jump from CD host to DT next . “ PRP stress these animals and DT means PRP ’re creating an environment for viruses to succeed , where in most NNS DT viruses MD ’ve been put to check , "" he VBD . "" And with DT , everyone is in very , very close proximity to each other , so what PRP ’ve got is CD event — and PRP only need CD event to take off — and DT next thing PRP VBP , PRP 's spilling over . ” And sometimes , DT viruses spill over into humans . According to a 2016 report from DT NNP Nations Environment Programme , around 60 percent of all infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic , as well as 75 percent of all emerging infectious diseases . Researchers RB detected an increase in DT rate of JJ , emerging infectious diseases , according to DT report . In DT case of DT novel NN , DT source is believed to be a market in Wuhan , NNP , WDT sold both dead and live animals . Arizona Game and Fish wildlife veterinarian Anne Justice - Allen VBD IN veterinarians and NN experts strongly recommend against having markets IN these , which can be densely packed , difficult to keep clean , and pose a higher risk of viruses jumping from animals into humans . She VBD DT current NN - CD outbreak is an example of how human actions to mix together animals WDT were n't normally together can cause diseases to jump into JJ hosts . "" DT more PRP increase DT interaction between NNS and animals , especially wildlife and especially livestock as well , or animals WDT are raised for food , DT more likely PRP are to see DT kind of situation crop up , "" she VBD . DT NNP - CD outbreak is an example of DT risk zoonotic diseases pose . Other well - known examples of zoonotic diseases WDT impact humans are West Nile NN , HIV , Ebola , Zika , bird NN , Middle East respiratory syndrome , or MERS , Rift Valley fever , and sudden acute respiratory syndrome , or SARS . On average , CD JJ infectious NN emerges in humans every four months , according to DT UNEP report , but not all are this severe . “ While PRP is very uncommon for diseases in animals to suddenly jump and become so transmissible between NNS as this NN did , DT more PRP do DT sort of thing , mixing animals together ... then DT more likely IN NN is VBG to be able to jump into NNS and become transmissible between NNS , "" Justice - Allen VBD . With NN NN effects such as drought , increasing temperatures and wildfires , Justice - Allen VBD animals will be forced to move to JJ areas . DT MD lead to DT same type of crowding and mixing seen in live animal markets and possibly expose animals to JJ diseases . FIGHTING NN : Using robots to speed up testing , ASU hopes to open drive - thru NN testing VBG JJ temperatures are increasing DT habitat ranges of some insects WDT transmit diseases from CD organism to another , such as mosquitoes or ticks . NN is RB lengthening DT season in which these insects can survive in some areas , leading to a boom in their population . In certain areas , these insects , RB known as NN vectors , are now able to survive NN - round where PRP were n't able to before . DT increased range and abundance of vectors MD lead to more widespread NNS of mosquito - and tick - borne diseases such as malaria , West Nile NN , dengue fever , chikungunya , Zika , and Lyme NN , according to Heidi Brown , an ASU researcher who studies vector - borne diseases . Brown is CD of DT researchers who works with DT Arizona Department of NNP Services on a Building Resilience Against NNP Effects plan , which investigates DT impacts of NN NN on human NN , projects future scenarios and suggests solutions to mitigate those effects . Arizona is CD of 16 NN grant recipients creating a BRACE plan as part of DT CDC's NNP - Ready NNPS and Cities Initiative . "" PRP have to be prepared for DT known , which is increases in DT stuff WDT PRP 're already seeing , but PRP RB have to be prepared for DT unknown , which is novel introductions , "" she VBD . In Arizona , known diseases such as West Nile NNP are likely to become a bigger concern , and MD spread into JJ areas of DT NN outside of Maricopa County , Brown VBD . "" Flagstaff does n't typically VB about or worry too much about West Nile NNP , and PRP do n't usually have a lot of NNS up RB , but EX 's evidence WDT suggests IN PRP might need to start making sure IN PRP 're watching for PRP , "" she VBD . Arizona is RB worried about other mosquito - born diseases IN chikungunya and dengue fever , which are n't currently part of Arizona 's ecosystem but MD become permanently established in DT future . Factors IN drought can RB cause vectors to cluster around NN sources alongside of animals , leading to further mixing and further possibilities for JJ diseases spread in vectors . Another bridge between humans and animal diseases is domestic animals , according to Bernard Bett , a scientist at International Livestock Research Institute . Around DT NN , Bett VBD agriculture is increasingly encroaching on wild lands , bringing humans and domestic animals closer to wild ones and disturbing DT natural ecosystem . But domestic animals have been bred in such a way IN PRP lack DT genetic diversity needed for NN resilience and can then pass DT infection on to humans . CD example is DT bird NN , which moved from wild birds into domestic poultry before being passed to humans . Demand for milk and meat "" driven mainly by fast - growing populations of urban consumers in developing NNS , "" is projected to double by 2050 , according to DT UNEP report , meaning IN DT problem is likely to VB worse as agricultural demand expands . Urbanization RB can encroach on wild lands , Varsani VBD , and DT means humans are coming into increased contact with animals — creating another potential avenue for NN transmission . Increased zoonotic NN spread MD RB have devastating effects on animals , especially those already at risk from other NN NN effects . “ PRP have a number of endangered species here in Arizona which are kind of on DT edge when PRP comes to being able to respond to JJ stressors , "" Justice - Allen VBD . CD is DT Mount Graham red squirrel , whose habitat was severely damaged by a wildfire in 2017 . While DT population seems to be recovering , Justice - Allen VBD , "" another stressor might tip them over DT edge . "" Other populations on DT brink include DT California condor , DT black - footed ferret , and Arizona 's indigenous snakes and amphibians such as frogs . Some are already being challenged by NN . Black - footed ferrets feed on prairie dogs , but DT plague , spread by fleas , can wipe out entire colonies of prairie dogs , decimating DT ferrets ' food supply . This NN is n't native to North America , currently has a small incident rate in humans and is curable in most NNS . But NNS of plague MD surge in coming NNS due to NN NN , according to Justice - Allen . "" DT dynamics of plague outbreaks is changing , or will VB , "" she VBD . "" This spring is setting PRP up for a pretty significant plague outbreak . "" Arizona 's frogs and other amphibians are battling a fungal NN called chytridiomycosis , which was first seen in Africa and interferes with DT ability of their skin to absorb moisture . These diseases , along with mosquito - and tick - borne diseases , are just a few known diseases WDT Arizona experts are monitoring . But EX 's always DT possibility for unknowns — for JJ diseases to show up unexpectedly — especially in tight living conditions . In more clustered spaces , Varsani VBD EX 's a greater chance for an animal to become infected with two different diseases at DT same NN , opening DT possibility for DT birth of chimeras , or mash - ups , of two different , related viruses . If two viruses are infecting DT same cell , when those viruses replicate , PRP can combine into a JJ hybrid NN WDT MD jump into JJ animals WDT were previously unaffected . "" PRP mix components and what PRP ’re then doing is PRP ’re allowing for these viral genomes to evolve very rapidly and adapt to a JJ host , "" he VBD . Varsani RB works to find and VB unknown viruses in remote areas , such as DT polar regions . He has traveled to Antarctica nearly every NN since he first visited about seven NNS ago , and VBD viruses he studies RB MD have been around for a while , but were only discovered recently . CD example is a circovirus WDT has only recently been noticed in penguins and WDT causes lethal feather loss . Viruses in DT polar regions are just as abundant as PRP are in other parts of DT NN , he VBD , and since DT polar regions are expected to see some of DT most dramatic changes due to NN NN , these regions and their viruses are crucial to understand for DT future . As seen with DT NN - CD outbreak , NNS for JJ diseases take NN to develop , as do tests to screen for them . Arizona and other NNS have come up with plans to deal with increased outbreaks and have vector - control measures in place , but Brown acknowledged IN PRP can be hard to prepare for JJ emerging diseases . "" PRP 's a long process to be able to come up with tests and identify JJ pathogens , especially when PRP 're not DT ones PRP 're used to looking for . ” DT Arizona Game and Fish Department monitors for JJ NN emergences by surveilling animal populations and investigating animal deaths to ensure IN DT cause of death was n't an unknown NN , according to Justice - Allen . Bett VBD NN care officials can take other measures to ensure IN EX is a structured , strong NN system in place with contingency plans for NN outbreaks and centers where patients can be isolated or receive supportive treatment . “ I wonder to what extent DT U.S. anticipated this spread . If PRP have good anticipation , DT ’s a good first line of defense , "" Bett VBD . Even with further NN of NN effects on NN , EX can be unpredicted challenges in trying to anticipate and address JJ diseases , VBD Ben Beard , DT deputy director of DT CDC ’s Division of Vector - Borne Diseases in Fort Collins , Colorado . "" While long term trends in NN NN can be modeled , specific weather events or disasters such as hurricanes , floods , or fires are very difficult to predict and MD have a big impact on NN outbreaks , "" he wrote in an email to DT Republic . To prepare and respond to future outbreaks , he VBD , a strong JJ NN framework WDT prioritizes JJ NN surveillance , NN and local preparedness , and long - term research MD be necessary . In addition to being more conscious of how NNS affect DT environment and existing ecosystems , Varsani VBD identifying and understanding DT viruses present in DT NN currently can help society better prepare to control them . This is no small feat , considering IN viruses are among DT most abundant entities on DT NN . "" Viruses are understudied , "" he VBD . “ PRP have no idea what DT next entity will be , nobody expected this outbreak to take place and it's now consumed most of DT NN in a very short period . ” Amanda Morris covers all things bioscience , which includes NN care , technology , JJ research and DT environment .

DT report details a rapidly changing Arctic environment featuring melting NN , a greener landscape , and , alarmingly , greenhouse - gas NNS on par with some large nations . DT Arctic MD be releasing upwards of 600 million tons of net carbon per NN , DT report finds , potentially putting DT region alongside Mexico , Canada , and South Korea as CD of DT NN ’s largest contributors to atmospheric CO2 . Though DT carbon emitted from such industrialized nations is DT result of burning fossil fuels , DT hundreds of millions of metric tons pumping out of DT Arctic is DT result of thawing permafrost . Permafrost being permafrost , PRP takes more than DT seasons changing for PRP to actually melt PRP . DT increasingly rapid thawing of frozen Arctic NN is DT result of NN NN , and DT NOAA ’s report card reveals IN temperatures are continuing to rise in DT NN ’s nether - regions , which are n’t as icy as PRP used to be . In August , for instance , DT average NN surface temperatures in several highlighted Arctic bodies of NN were 1 - 7 degrees Celsius warmer than DT average from 1982 - 2010 . Just as frightening : DT average land surface temperature north of 60 degrees N was DT second - warmest since 1900 . PRP ’s not just permafrost IN rising temperatures are affecting . DT report RB found : • None DT Greenland NNP Sheet is losing 267 billion metric tons of NN per NN . • None Two of DT five lowest months for North American Arctic snow cover in DT 53 NNS records have been kept occurred this summer . • None NNP NN extent this summer was tied for DT second - lowest since satellite imagery recorded coverage in 1979 . NN NN extent in DT winter was RB second - lowest , narrowly falling short of DT lowest - ever total , which occurred in …2018 . These changes are threatening indigenous Arctic communities and Arctic wildlife directly , as well as DT rest of DT NN , on a profound scale . DT deteriorating Greenland NNP Sheet is causing DT JJ NN level to rise 0.7 millimeters per NN , and Arctic carbon NNS are helping cook DT NN at a rate WDT will soon be irreversible unless dramatic steps are taken . DT need for urgent action was stressed Wednesday by teenage NN activist Greta Thunberg , who spoke to delegates at a NNP Nations NN summit in Madrid . “ Our leaders are not behaving as though PRP were in an emergency , ” VBD Thunberg , who DT same day was named NNP magazine ’s Person of NNP . “ If EX ’s a child standing in DT middle of DT road and cars are coming at full speed , PRP do n’t look away because PRP is too uncomfortable . PRP immediately run out and rescue DT child . And without DT sense of urgency , how can PRP , DT NNS , understand IN PRP are facing a real crisis . ” Some governing bodies are at least trying . DT European Commission on Wednesday revealed plans for a European Green Deal WDT MD reimagine DT continent ’s economy in accordance with DT NN crisis . Meanwhile , DT NN of DT NN ’s second - largest carbon emitter is dismantling efforts to fight DT problem and struggling to even feign concern . “ NN NN is very important to me , ” NNP NNP managed last week in London despite his penchant for slashing environmental regulations . “ I ’ve done JJ environmental impact statements over my life and I believe very strongly in very , very crystal clear , clean NN and clean air .

Use_VB this_DT form_NN to_TO ask_VB your_PRP$ question_NN :_:","DT NNP - CD lockdown has cut NN NN NNS - for now . But some governments VBP to VB further by harnessing their JJ recovery plans to boost low - carbon industries . Their slogan is "" Build Back Better "" , but can PRP succeed ? I 've just had a light bulb moment . DT feisty little wren chirping loudly in DT matted ivy outside my back door is telling PRP something important about JJ NN NN . DT 's because , intertwined with DT melodious notes of a robin , I can actually hear its song clearly . Normally , both birds are muffled by DT insistent rumble of traffic , but DT din has been all but extinguished in DT peace of lockdown . DT drop in traffic is a major contributor to DT fall in NN - NN CO2 NNS PRP 've witnessed globally . Before DT NNP - CD crisis , PRP accepted DT dominance of traffic noise as an inevitable consequence of city living . Now , PRP have sampled an alternative urban ambience . Governments currently face a stark choice : bail out polluting businesses , using DT as leverage to impose environmentally - minded reforms , or let them return to their carbon - intensive activities as an JJ quick fix . But JJ members of DT NN have little desire to return to DT NN of affairs before lockdown . In a poll , a fifth of members of DT motoring group DT AA , VBD PRP MD work more from home in future . This has implications for DT UK NN 's £ 28bn road - building programme which assumes IN traffic will rise by 1 % per NN - a conjecture WDT now looks unlikely . DT stay - at - home trend will be offset somewhat by nervous JJ transport users shunning trains for fear of infection , and by long - distance commuters who might decide IN if PRP only need to visit DT office three days a week , PRP 'll buy a home even further away . DT AA , which for NNS was seen as DT voice of motorists , has asked DT NN to VB again about its £ 28bn road expansion . Its NN , Edmund King , has suggested DT money MD be better spent on improving broadband Another likely winner from DT crisis is DT movement fighting to turn city streets over to pedestrians and cyclists . This has already happened in places IN Paris , which is rolling out 650 km of "" corona cycle - ways "" , and Milan , which has a programme to prioritise pedestrians and cyclists . DT determination to seize DT moment for environmental NN stretches further than DT transport sector . DT UK is CD of several nations looking to reboot its environmental strategy by calling in favours from private industry . After all , PRP was NN which bailed out employers when DT crunch came in March . DT catchphrase is "" Build Back Better "" . But PRP MD seem to face a direct challenge in DT shape of NNP and DT NNP . DT economies of both these superpowers have been savaged by DT effects of NN . PRP are desperate to VB back to pre-virus levels of output , so their leaders MD VB DT surest means of doing so is through tried and trusted NN NN fossil fuels . For those seeking a greener way out of DT NNP - CD slump , renewable NN will help , along with electric vehicle charging points and broadband . Frans Timmermans , vice NN of DT European Commission , is on DT same track . He is leading work on a Green Deal to make DT EU 's economy sustainable and says IN not a single Euro should be spent propping up old , dirty industries . All NNP - CD recovery investment should VB towards commerce WDT either helps reduce carbon NNS or promotes digital business , he insists . But some MEPs from parties on DT right warn IN DT pandemic will have "" far - reaching "" JJ and social consequences . PRP insist DT EU must scale back its pre-crisis NN ambitions . DT 's led some governments , IN Germany and DT UK , to offer hand - outs to polluting industries without imposing green conditions . In DT UK , DT issue is causing contortions among politicians torn between saving existing jobs and conserving DT NN . MPs from DT Liberal Democrats - thought of as CD of DT "" greenest "" UK parties - have joined other parliamentarians in demanding a conditional rescue for DT airline industry . PRP say IN if ministers do n't step in , tens of thousands of jobs will be lost . But DT firms should promise to off - set their NNS by , for example , planting trees . Off - setting is hugely contentious . Doug Parr , chief scientist at Greenpeace , argues : "" Any NN bailout should focus on workers , not DT industry itself . "" PRP should be conditional on DT industry agreeing to shrink until - if ever - low - carbon technology is available - which is n't now . "" DT begs a question : which industries should qualify for support ? Should cash VB exclusively to self - evidently green sectors IN solar power - or to dirty firms trying to clean up ? Take DT fossil fuel firms WDT pay our pension dividends by drilling for DT stuff WDT 's over - heating DT NN . DT UK's oil and gas industry warns IN 30,000 jobs MD be lost because of DT pandemic and DT current low oil price . But why MD governments support a commodity WDT 's fuelling DT NN crisis , which is judged by DT UN to be deeper than DT NNP - CD crisis ? Perhaps PRP 's not RB simple . Lord Stern , DT former Treasury chief who 's now a NN expert , told me each firm should be judged on its trajectory , not on its current NN . "" DT oil and gas industries are producing stuff PRP VBP to run down very quickly , "" he VBD . "" But PRP do see some companies - IN BP and Shell - which are declaring PRP are moving in a direction where PRP VBP to be VBG zero carbon . "" So , PRP ca n't be indiscriminate or dogmatic . PRP have to look where DT industry is VBG . "" At least UK environmentalists are dealing with firms WDT agree on DT need to tackle NN NN . In DT NNP , some fossil fuel firms have been determined to pursue NN bail - outs without strings binding them to a less polluting future . DT Democratic Party has a long - standing proposal for a "" Green NNP Deal "" to promote clean technology . But NNP Donald NNP has minimised DT importance of NN NN . He has promised to help struggling fossil fuel firms , although his efforts have not taken root in a major way . Then EX 's NNP . In 2015 , its leaders were persuaded by NNP Barack Obama to make major NN NN commitments as part of DT Paris NN agreement . Since then , NNP has suffered job losses and fuel shortages . Beijing has resorted to a quick fix for DT economy by building coal - fired power plants . DT green NN tank NNP NNP Monitor says DT number of plants NNP approved in DT first three weeks of March 2020 - equivalent to 7,960 megawatts ( MW ) - was more than DT number agreed in DT whole of 2019 ( 6,310 MW ) . • A SIMPLE GUIDE : How do I protect myself ? • AVOIDING CONTACT : DT rules on self - isolation and exercise • TESTING : Can I VB tested for NN ? DT does n't take into account NNP 's estimated $ 1 trillion investment in its "" Belt and Road "" initiative to build huge , carbon - intensive infrastructure projects across developing NNS . Unless NNP and NNP NNP VBP their spots ( or DT Democratic candidate wins DT NNP election ) , Europe 's Build Back Better campaign wo n't be enough to protect DT increasingly fragile NN , even if PRP does engineer a green recovery . And PRP have a lesson from history . Nick Robins from DT London School of Economics ( LSE ) estimates IN in DT JJ financial crisis of 2008 just 16 % of JJ stimulus plans were green - mainly because NNP invested massively in fossil fuel projects . He tells me : "" If PRP have any hope of combating NN NN , PRP must make absolutely sure PRP do PRP better this NN .

Carbon dioxide levels today are higher than at any point in at least DT past 800,000 NNS . In fact , DT last NN DT atmospheric CO amounts were this high was more than 3 million NNS ago , when temperature was 2°–3 °C ( 3.6°–5.4 °F ) higher than during DT pre-industrial era , and NN level was 15 – 25 meters ( 50 – 80 feet ) higher than today . Carbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of DT fossil fuels WDT NNS are burning for NN . Fossil fuels IN coal and oil contain carbon WDT plants pulled out of DT atmosphere through photosynthesis over DT span of JJ millions of NNS ; PRP are returning DT carbon to DT atmosphere in just a few hundred NNS . Squeeze or stretch DT graph in either direction by holding DT Shift key while PRP click and drag . DT bright red line ( source data ) shows monthly average carbon dioxide at NOAA 's Mauna Loa Observatory on Hawai'i in parts per million ( ppm ) : DT number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air . Over DT course of DT NN , values are higher in Northern Hemisphere winter and lower in summer . DT dark red line shows DT annual trend , calculated as a 12 - month rolling average . According to DT NN of DT NNP in 2018 report from NOAA and DT American Meteorological Society , JJ atmospheric carbon dioxide was 407.4 ± 0.1 ppm in 2018 , a JJ record high . DT is an increase of 2.5 ± 0.1 ppm from 2017 , similar to DT increase of 2.2 ± 0.1 ppm between 2016 and 2017 . In DT 1960s , DT JJ growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide was roughly 0.6 ± 0.1 ppm per NN . Over DT past decade , however , DT growth rate has been closer to 2.3 ppm per NN . DT annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over DT past 60 NNS is about 100 times faster than previous natural increases , such as those WDT occurred at DT end of DT last NN age 11,000 - 17,000 NNS ago . Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas : a gas WDT absorbs and radiates heat . Warmed by sunlight , NNP ’s land and ocean surfaces continuously radiate thermal infrared NN ( heat ) . Unlike oxygen or nitrogen ( which make up most of our atmosphere ) , greenhouse gases absorb DT heat and release PRP gradually over NN , IN bricks in a fireplace after DT fire goes out . Without this natural greenhouse effect , NNP ’s average annual temperature MD be below freezing instead of close to 60 °F . But increases in greenhouse gases have tipped DT NNP 's NN budget out of balance , trapping additional heat and raising NNP 's average temperature . Carbon dioxide is DT most important of NNP ’s long - lived greenhouse gases . PRP absorbs less heat per molecule than DT greenhouse gases methane or nitrous oxide , but PRP ’s more abundant and PRP stays in DT atmosphere much longer . And while carbon dioxide is less abundant and less powerful than NN vapor on a molecule per molecule basis , PRP absorbs wavelengths of thermal NN WDT NN vapor does not , which means PRP adds to DT greenhouse effect in a unique way . Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide are responsible for about two - thirds of DT total NN imbalance WDT is causing NNP 's temperature to rise . Another reason carbon dioxide is important in DT NNP system is IN PRP dissolves into DT ocean IN DT fizz in a can of soda . PRP reacts with NN molecules , producing carbonic acid and lowering DT ocean 's pH . Since DT start of DT Industrial Revolution , DT pH of DT ocean 's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10 . This drop in pH is called ocean acidification . A drop of 0.1 MD not seem IN a lot , but DT pH scale is logarithmic ; a 1 - unit drop in pH means a tenfold increase in acidity . A NN of 0.1 means a roughly 30 % increase in acidity . Increasing acidity interferes with DT ability of marine life to extract calcium from DT NN to build their shells and skeletons . Natural increases in carbon dioxide concentrations have periodically warmed NNP ’s temperature during NN age cycles over DT past million NNS or more . DT warm episodes ( interglacials ) began with a small increase in sunlight due to a tiny wobble in NNP ’s axis of rotation or in DT path of its orbit around DT Sun . DT little bit of extra sunlight caused a little bit of NN . As DT oceans warmed , PRP outgassed carbon dioxide — IN a can of soda VBG flat in DT heat of a summer day . DT extra carbon dioxide in DT atmosphere amplified DT initial NN . Based on air bubbles trapped in mile - thick NN cores ( and other paleoclimate evidence ) , PRP VBP IN during DT NN age cycles of DT past million NNS or so , carbon dioxide never exceeded 300 ppm . Before DT Industrial Revolution started in DT mid-1700s , DT JJ average amount of carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm . By DT NN continuous observations began at Mauna Loa Volcanic Observatory in 1958 , JJ atmospheric carbon dioxide was already 315 ppm . On NNP 9 , 2013 , DT daily average carbon dioxide measured at Mauna Loa surpassed 400 ppm for DT first NN on record . Less than two NNS later , in 2015 , DT JJ amount went over 400 ppm for DT first NN . If JJ NN demand continues to grow and to be met mostly with fossil fuels , atmospheric carbon dioxide is projected to exceed 900 ppm by DT end of this century . Collins , M. , R. Knutti , J.

This agreement is for an exclusive JJ license to commercialise a novel NN technology from DT John Curtin School of NNP Research at ANU . Dengue Fever is DT lead indication , but DT technology MD RB facilitate DT design of NNS against a number of other infectious diseases including Murray River encephalitis and Japanese encephalitis . DT increasing incidence of mosquito - borne NN is a major NN concern worldwide as NN NN expands DT range of DT carrier mosquitoes , exposing larger human populations . DT agreement includes provision for BioDiem to sublicense DT technology . Industry standard royalties apply , but apart from a small contribution towards patent registration costs EX is no up - front outlay for BioDiem . DT agreement follows DT signing of a term sheet announced to DT ASX on 6 June 2012 . Dengue Fever is a NN caused by a mosquito - borne NN WDT affects between 50 and 100 million NNS a NN , and according to DT NNP NNP Organization DT incidence is increasing significantly . Although only a small percentage of NNS are fatal , non-fatal NNS can be extremely debilitating . Dengue Fever currently has no existing NN , and control methods currently include attempts to address mosquito populations with varying effectiveness . DT technology is complementary to DT BioDiem portfolio as well as DT company 's strategic focus on NNS and therapies for infectious diseases and related cancers . "" PRP are delighted to announce DT completion of this licensing agreement , which sees BioDiem 's commercial expertise in DT area of NNS fittingly partnered with DT exciting research developed by ANU . Our focus on infectious diseases is an excellent fit for this JJ technology which has strong potential as an asset for outlicensing "" VBD BioDiem CEO Julie Phillips . BioDiem 's current strategy for DT ANU technology includes leveraging DT company 's JJ partnering network to deliver an outlicensing partner for development of DT technology , providing an opportunity to secure a royalties stream without significant development costs on DT part of BioDiem . BioDiem is an ASX - listed company based in Melbourne with an international focus on discovering , developing and commercialising NN - class research and technology targeting cancers and infectious diseases . BioDiem 's core technologies include DT Live Attenuated Influenza NNP ( LAIV ) , DT SAVINE platform and DT BDM - I antimicrobial compound . DT LAIV influenza NN is an intranasal NN to prevent infection from seasonal and pandemic influenza . DT LAIV influenza NN can be produced using both egg - based and cell - based manufacturing methods . DT cell - based LAIV NN has completed a Phase II clinical trial in Europe . DT egg - based LAIV NN technology is licensed to DT NNP NNP Organization as part of DT NNP Pandemic Influenza Action Plan to Increase NNP Supply . DT LAIV influenza NN is marketed as Nasovac™ in India by DT Serum Institute of India , and has been licensed to NNP - based Changchun BCHT Biotechnology Co . DT LAIV NN was in - licensed from DT Institute of Experimental Medicine in St Petersburg , Russia where PRP has been used for over a decade in JJ millions of NNS - NNS , adults and DT elderly . DT LAIV is administered by nasal spray and induces a rapid immune response in DT mucosal lining of DT nose and pharynx . DT LAIV is RB being developed as a viral vector for making novel non-influenza NNS for different diseases including cancers . Viruses have DT ability to generate proteins prolifically and can be programmed to produce NN - specific proteins . As part of a NN , NN - specific proteins can help generate a beneficial immune response . SAVINE ( patented Scrambled Antigen NNP ) is a platform technology for DT design of antigens for incorporation into NNS targeting an immune response to a range of different diseases . SAVINE antigens are encoded as synthetic genes which , together with a delivery technology such as BioDiem 's LAIV - based NN vector technology , can be used to develop novel NNS . BDM - I is a synthetic compound targeted at DT treatment of serious human infections . BDM - I is in DT preclinical stage with outlicensing as DT intended outcome . BDM - I is active against a range of pathogenic micro-organisms including gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria , fungi and protozoa . Key patents have been filed around BDM - I 's antimicrobial activity , including for activity against Plasmodium falciparum , responsible for causing DT most commonly severe form of malaria , and Trichomonas vaginalis , DT protozoan responsible for causing a common sexually transmitted NN named trichomoniasis . BioDiem is RB developing BDM-E , a tetra peptide synthetic compound , as a treatment for ophthalmic disorders . DT NNP Food & Drug Administration ( USFDA ) has granted Orphan Drug designation to BDM-E for DT treatment of retinitis pigmentosa , a serious degenerative NN of DT retina . BioDiem 's research is ongoing in partnership with internationally recognised laboratories . For additional information , please visit www.biodiem.com"

DT average JJ temperature has increased by 1 °C since DT start of DT Industrial Revolution , DT 600 - page report says — adding IN DT last 115 NNS comprise “ DT warmest period in DT history of modern civilization ” . DT analysis warns IN temperatures MD increase another 4°C by DT end of DT century , with dramatic consequences for humans and natural ecosystems . DT findings are at odds with DT policies of NNP NNP Donald NNP , who has questioned well - established tenets of NN NN and vowed to protect and promote DT NNP fossil - fuel industry . NNP 's stances led JJ NNS to worry IN his administration MD try to block or tamper with DT NN - NN assessment , but several NNS who helped to write DT document reported no problems . “ PRP were n’t interfered with , and PRP ended up producing something WDT I VBP is of tremendous value , ” says David Fahey , an atmospheric scientist with DT National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder , Colorado , and a coordinating lead author of DT analysis . DT NN - NN report is DT first volume of DT fourth National NNP Assessment , a legally mandated analysis of DT causes and impacts of JJ NN WDT is due in 2018 . DT other two parts of DT forthcoming assessment were released today in draft form , for JJ comment . CD analysis focuses on how NN NN is affecting life in DT NNP NNPS , from crop yields to property damage from extreme weather . DT other summarizes DT latest findings on DT JJ carbon cycle . Both of those documents will undergo a formal review by DT NNP National Academy of Sciences . “ DT NN speaks for itself , ” says Don Wuebbles , a a NN scientist at DT University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign and co-chair of DT NN - NN report . “ PRP ’s hard to counteract DT basic observations and DT truth of DT NN with any kind of political playing around . ” DT trio of documents paints a dramatic picture of how JJ NN is affecting NNS and communities across DT NNP NNPS . Tidal flooding is accelerating in more than 25 coastal cities along DT Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico . Large forest fires have become more frequent in DT western part of DT country , while warmer spring temperatures and shrinking mountain snowpack are combining to reduce DT amount of NN available to DT region 's cities and farms . As a result , DT draft NN - impacts report warns , “ chronic , long - duration hydrological drought is increasingly possible before DT end of DT century ” . DT report comes just days before DT latest NNP Nations NN talks kick off in Bonn , Germany . PRP will RB be DT first major summit since NNP vowed to pull DT NNP NNPS out of DT 2015 Paris NN pact . Few observers expect NNP NN 's latest set of NN - NN analyses to affect how DT NNP administation approaches NN and environmental issues . In August , DT NNP National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration disbanded an advisory committee WDT was intended to help DT nation prepare for a warmer NN , by translating DT findings of DT coming NN assessment into guidance for cities , NNS and industry . Nor is PRP clear whether senior NNP administration officials will accept DT reports ' core scientific conclusions . As recently as March , NNP Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt VBD he did not believe IN carbon dioxide is major driver of JJ NN . Nonetheless , JJ NNS and environmentalists lauded DT JJ reports for bolstering DT case for more - aggressive action against NN NN . “ DT full assessment , when PRP gets published , is VBG to show IN EX are palpable impacts WDT are VBG to hit every part of DT country , ” says Andrew Light , a senior fellow at DT NNP Resources Institute , an environmental NN - tank in Washington DC . “ PRP ’s DT responsibility of leaders to take note of DT and act accordingly . ”"

He was RB DT eldest son of NNP John Adams , DT second U.S. NN . John Quincy Adams was DT eldest son of NNP John Adams and DT sixth NN of DT NNP NNPS . In his pre-presidential NNS , Adams was CD of America 's greatest diplomats ( formulating , among other things , what became DT Monroe Doctrine ) ; in his post - presidential NNS , he conducted a consistent and often dramatic fight against DT expansion of slavery . Though full of promise , his presidential NNS were difficult . He died in 1848 in Washington , D.C . Though he was CD of few Americans to be so prepared to serve as NN of DT NNP NNPS , John Quincy Adams 's best NNS of service came before and after his NN in DT White House . Born on July 11 , 1767 , in Braintree , Massachusetts , John Quincy was DT son of John Adams , a prodigy of DT American Revolution who MD become DT second U.S. NN just before his John Quincy 's 30th birthday , and his wife , future first lady Abigail Adams . As a child , Adams witnessed firsthand DT birth of DT nation . From DT family farm , he and his mother watched DT Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775 . At age 10 , he traveled to France with his father , who was securing aid during DT Revolution . By age 14 , Adams was receiving "" on - DT - job "" training in DT diplomatic corps and VBG to school . In 1781 , he accompanied diplomat Francis Dana to Russia , serving as his secretary and translator . In 1783 , he traveled to Paris to serve as secretary to his father , negotiating DT Treaty of Paris . During this NN , Adams attended schools in Europe and became fluent in French , Dutch and German . Returning home in 1785 , he entered Harvard College and graduated in 1787 . In 1790 , Adams became a practicing attorney in Boston . As tensions mounted between Britain and France , he supported NNP George Washington 's neutrality policy of 1793 . NNP Washington appreciated young Adams 's support so much IN he appointed him U.S. minister to Holland . When his father was elected NN in 1797 , he appointed his son U.S. minister to Prussia . On DT way to his post , Adams traveled to England to wed Louisa Catherine Johnson , DT daughter of Joshua Johnson , DT first U.S. consul to Great Britain . After his father lost his bid for a second term in 1800 , he recalled his son from Prussia . In 1802 , Adams was elected to DT Massachusetts legislature , and CD NN later , he was elected DT U.S. Senate . IN his father , Adams was considered a member of DT Federalist Party , but in truth , he was never a strict party man . During his NN in DT Senate , he supported DT Louisiana Purchase and NNP Thomas Jefferson 's Embargo Act—actions WDT made him very unpopular with other Federalists . In June 1808 , Adams broke with DT Federalists , resigned from his Senate seat and became a Democratic - Republican . Adams returned to DT diplomatic corps in 1809 , when NNP James Madison appointed him DT first officially recognized minister to Russia ( Francis Dana was never officially accepted as a U.S. ambassador by DT Russian NN ) . In 1814 , Adams was recalled from Russia to serve as chief negotiator for DT U.S. NN during DT Treaty of Ghent , settling DT War of 1812 . DT following NN , Adams served as minister to England , a position his father had held 30 NNS earlier . In a post he was most suited for , Adams served as secretary of NN in NNP James Monroe 's administration from 1817 to 1825 . During this NN , he negotiated DT Adams - Onis Treaty , acquiring Florida for DT NNP NNPS . He RB helped negotiate DT Treaty of 1818 , settling DT long - standing border dispute between Britain and DT NNP NNPS over DT Oregon Country , and initiating improved relations between Great Britain and its former colonies . By age 50 , Adams had amassed a very impressive record of JJ service , but perhaps his most notable and enduring achievement was DT Monroe Doctrine . After DT Napoleonic wars had ended , several Latin American colonies of Spain rose up and declared independence . A defining moment for DT NNP NNPS , Adams crafted DT Monroe Doctrine , which stated DT NNP NNPS MD resist any European country 's efforts to thwart independence movements in Latin America ; DT doctrine , first introduced in 1823 , served to justify U.S. intervention in Latin America throughout DT late 19th and most of DT 20th centuries . By 1824 , Adams was well - positioned to be DT next NN of DT NNP NNPS . However , DT political NN had changed DT way presidents were elected at DT NN ; only DT Democratic - Republican Party was viable and five candidates emerged , each representing different sections of DT country . Running against Adams were Southerners John C. Calhoun and William Crawford , and Westerners Henry Clay and Andrew Jackson . In addition , by DT 1824 election , 18 of 24 NNS had moved to choose electors to DT Electoral College by popular vote instead of to NN legislatures . In DT Electoral College vote , no CD candidate had a clear majority and , subsequently , DT election was sent to DT House of Representatives . Clay threw his support to Adams , who was elected on DT first ballot . Adams 's victory shocked Jackson , who had won DT popular vote and fully expected to be NN . When Adams later appointed Clay secretary of NN , Jackson Democrats cried "" corrupt bargain , "" and were enraged at DT seemingly quid pro quo arrangement . Adams entered DT presidency with several debilitating political liabilities . He possessed DT temperament of his father : Aloof , stubborn and ferociously independent in his convictions . As NN , Adams failed to develop DT political relationships needed — even among members of his own party — to effect significant NN . PRP did n't help IN his political opponents were set on making him a CD - term NN . In his first NN in office , Adams proposed several far - sighted programs WDT he felt MD promote NN , as well as encourage a spirit of enterprise and invention in DT NNP NNPS ; these goals included building a network of highways and canals to link DT different sections of DT country , setting aside JJ lands for conservation , surveying DT entire U.S. coast and building astronomical observatories . Adams RB saw DT need for practical solutions to universal problems , thusly calling for DT establishment of a uniform system of weights and measures and improving DT patent system . While these MD have been admirable goals for an aspiring nation , PRP were considered overambitious and unrealistic for DT NNP NNPS in DT 1820s . Adams 's proposals were met with scorn and derision by political opponents ; critics charged IN DT NN 's policies MD enlarge DT powers and influence of DT federal NN at DT expense of DT NN and local governments , and some accused Adams of promoting programs to enhance DT elite and neglect DT common NNS . In DT midterm election of 1826 , Jacksonian opponents won majorities in both Houses of Congress . As a result , JJ of Adams 's initiatives either failed to pass legislation or were woefully underfunded . DT election of 1828 was an especially bitter and personal affair . As was DT tradition , neither candidate personally campaigned , but supporters conducted ruthless attacks on DT opposing candidates . DT campaign reached a low point when DT press accused Jackson 's wife , Rachel , of bigamy . Adams lost DT election by a decisive margin , and he left Washington without attending Jackson 's inauguration . Adams did not retire from JJ life after leaving DT presidential office . In 1830 , he ran for and won a seat in DT U.S. House of Representatives , once again distinguishing himself as a statesman of DT first order . In 1836 , Adams focused his long - standing anti-slavery sentiment on defeating a gag - rule instituted by Southerners to stifle debate . In 1841 , he argued in front of DT Supreme Court on behalf of escaped African slaves in DT famous Amistad case , and won DT release of DT captives . On February 21 , 1848 , in his last contribution to his country , Adams was on DT floor of DT House of Representatives , arguing to honor U.S. Army officers who had served in DT Mexican - American War ( he opposed DT war , but felt IN DT U.S. NN was obligated to honor its veterans ) . During DT event , Adams suddenly collapsed , suffering from a massive cerebral hemorrhage . He was taken to DT Speaker 's Room in DT Capitol Building , where he died two days later , on February 23 , 1848 ."

""_''","VB breaking NN alerts and special reports . DT NN and stories WDT matter , delivered weekday mornings . More than 100 bushfires are raging in Australia as DT continent swelters under record heat , a double whammy of extremes WDT has amplified scrutiny of what experts say is stark inaction from DT NN on NN NN . Blazes across NNP South Wales and Queensland have scorched almost 7 million acres , and Australia experienced its hottest day on record Wednesday , when DT average temperature across DT country hit 105 degrees . DT nation 's woes are unfolding as Australia faces criticism for what have been described as its inadequate NN policies , including DT role of federal officials in thwarting negotiations at a recent U.N. summit on NN NN . Richie Merzian , director of DT NN and NN program at DT Australia Institute , a Canberra - based NN tank WDT conducts JJ policy research , called DT 2019 NNP Nations Framework Convention on NNP NNP a letdown . DT summit ended Sunday in a stalemate , with NNS largely delaying major decisions on plans to cut carbon NNS until next NN 's conference . "" PRP was terribly disappointing , "" Merzian VBD . "" Australia is literally on fire right now , and PRP 's clearly linked to NN NN in terms of its severity and duration . But instead of VBG RB to rally DT NN behind DT need for greater NN action , Australia was lobbying to do as little as possible . "" Seasonal bushfires occur naturally in Australia , but hotter and drier conditions due to NN NN have increased DT frequency of fires and their severity , VBD Andy Pitman , a NN modeler at DT University of NNP South Wales in Sydney . "" EX is an uncontroversial link whereby higher carbon dioxide levels in DT atmosphere from NN NN increase bushfire risk , "" Pitman VBD . "" All other things being equal , a fire WDT occurs now will be worse than a fire WDT occurred 20 to 30 NNS ago . "" Trees play an integral role in DT NN 's carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide as PRP grow . But research has shown IN when vegetation dries out — as during hot and dry summer months — DT increased amount of carbon dioxide acts as extra fuel for wildfires . Human activities , such as burning fossil fuels , release greenhouse gases WDT trap heat and raise surface temperatures . A 2018 NN of DT NN report from DT Australian NN 's Bureau of Meteorology found IN DT country has warmed by just over 1 degree Celsius since 1910 , "" leading to an increase in DT frequency of extreme heat events . "" Those heat waves , combined with dry conditions , are dangerous ingredients for bushfires , Pitman VBD , with circumstances appearing to be particularly severe at DT moment . "" This is unprecedented , "" Pitman VBD . "" I do n't VB PRP 've ever seen bushfires at this scale before . "" Bushfires are RB problematic because PRP release carbon dioxide into DT atmosphere . Australia 's fires are estimated to have emitted 250 million tons of carbon dioxide already — nearly half of DT nation 's total yearly average NNS — according to NASA data provided to DT Guardian . Those events have renewed focus on Australia 's prime minister , Scott Morrison , who has refused to answer questions about NN NN and their link to DT fires . His conservative administration has RB faced backlash for its policies and rhetoric surrounding JJ NN . In November , Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack VBD NN NN concerns were stoked by "" raving inner-city lefties , "" adding IN EX had been fires in Australia "" since NN began . "" Pitman VBD IN while EX had been some progress made on DT NN level , DT federal NN had shown a lack of political will . "" PRP almost see PRP as a negotiating or debating point , and it's not , "" Pitman VBD . "" This is an existential risk to communities and major regions of DT NN , and if governments do n't act , then DT situation will simply deteriorate . "" Imran Ahmad , a NN scientist at Australian National University , VBD DT Morrison administration 's stance was symptomatic of Australia 's complex history of NN NN policy . "" EX is an ideological drive against NN NN by certain vested interests , "" he VBD . Australia is DT NN 's largest exporter of coal and its third - largest exporter of fossil fuels , after Russia and Saudi Arabia . Merzian , who worked as a NN negotiator for DT NN for almost a decade , VBD those JJ ties have shaped DT country 's NN policies for decades — and invite international criticism . "" PRP ca n't be DT largest exporter of coal , which is DT largest source of greenhouse gas NNS when consumed , and not take any responsibility for DT , "" Merzian VBD . In 2012 , Australia 's Labor NN introduced a carbon tax WDT helped DT country reduce greenhouse gas NNS by about 1.4 percent by DT end of its second NN . But DT policy was unpopular , and in 2014 , DT newly elected NN repealed DT tax . "" Any JJ tax is unpopular , but unfortunately , by DT NN PRP was dismantled , PRP MD see IN PRP was working , "" Merzian VBD . "" PRP was reducing NNS , but PRP just did n't have enough momentum to survive quite a strong negative campaign . "" As CD of DT NNS WDT ratified DT 2015 Paris Agreement , a JJ pact aimed at reducing greenhouse gas NNS to fight NN NN , Australia will join 187 other NNS in pledging to meet its reduction goals next NN . Pitman VBD Australia has much at stake , with fragile ecosystems , such as DT Great Barrier Reef , under severe threat from NN oceans and DT country 's bushfires . Still , he added , PRP 's difficult to be optimistic about DT country 's direction . "" DT Great Barrier Reef is a multibillion - dollar asset to Australia , and it's being sacrificed at DT altar of carbon dioxide NNS , "" he VBD . "" PRP 's really important to understand IN decisions WDT need to be made on carbon emission are politically painful , and EX is no NN more skilled at avoiding difficult political decisions than politicians .

DT following three pledges underpin DT work DT council has been doing on NN NN : • To lead by example in reducing its carbon NNS NN on NN . • To help residents , community groups and businesses to reduce their NNS and manage NN risks . • To work with partners to help raise awareness and support initiatives to reduce and mitigate DT impacts of NN NN . PRP are now developing a draft NNP NNP and Air Quality Strategy WDT PRP plan to publish for consultation later in 2020 . This will outline DT steps WDT PRP ’ll be taking to tackle DT issue and reduce our impact on DT environment . DT drive to become a carbon neutral borough by 2030 starts now and PRP have started work to set out DT steps PRP as a council can take and how PRP can work together as a borough . In December 2019 , PRP held a NN NN summit to bring together ideas with partners . View a copy of DT presentation and DT Outcomes Report . Already PRP have : • Installed solar panels on DT roof of several of our council buildings . • Improved DT NN performance of DT council ’s Deanes and Parklands buildings • Set up a group of Environment Champions to promote sustainable practices among staff . • Installed a fresh air cooling system at DT Civic Offices , as well as being environmentally - friendly , DT initiative will generate a saving of £ 9,500 per NN . • Reduced DT distances our bin trucks travel by rebalancing DT rounds , with a monthly carbon saving of 3.8 % per month . With partners , PRP have : • Adopted a transport strategy with a focus on encouraging more sustainable transport including cycling and walking . • Given out loans and grants to improve insulation and install renewable NN sources . • Supported residents to apply for NN funding for NN efficient boilers . PRP are working on our next steps looking at greener ways of delivering council services . Here are just a few of DT projects PRP are working on : • With advice from DT NNP Savings Trust PRP are exploring greater use of electric vehicles . • Updating our Local Plan to ensure tougher standards associated with NN NN and NNS . • Reviewing DT NN efficiency of our accommodation and our staff and councillors ’ travel . • Delivering 3,500 homes at Manydown using DT Garden Towns ’ principle ."

DT shocking truth , as he says , is IN chemtrails are part of a benevolent program aimed at countering JJ NN . By cooperating in secret with jet fuel manufacturers , NN agents have carefully kept DT massive chemtrail efforts completely under wraps . “ I am only revealing this program because EX is no oversight in DT scientific community , no JJ discussion , and little concern for DT side - effects which are well known only to a few privileged NNS interested in continuing DT decades - long chemtrail program in secret . ” According to Snowden , chemtrails are DT only thing keeping DT NNP from JJ NN incineration , but at what price ? Because NN NN is a threat to U.S. agriculture , PRP has been labeled a national security issue . With DT influence and cooperation of Monsanto , a secret Geo-engineering lab dubbed Muad ’Dib has been operating since DT late 1960s , and DT chemtrail program is often referred to by insiders as its “ crown jewel . ” Muad ’Dib has aimed to protect North America ’s NN at all costs – even if DT means accelerating desertification in Sub -Saharan Africa or spreading trace amounts of carcinogens over lightly populated areas . Other side effects , which NNS at DT secret Muad ’Dib Geoengineering Lab have predicted , include droughts in DT Amazon and powerful windstorms along DT East Coast . Snowden shared decisive documents with DT Internet Chronicle , but out of concern for national security , only his testimonial can be published . These documents contain references to NNS who MD surely be targeted by foreign counterintelligence , and their knowledge is vital to short - term survival of DT NNP NNPS . Snowden VBD , “ If this program were to stop , DT NNS behind PRP strongly believe IN within just CD NN DT North American NN MD spiral out of control , and crop failures MD lead to a series of devastating famines WDT MD quickly depopulate urban centers . ” Because DT program has been carried out on such a massive scale , skeptics might find Snowden ’s story unbelievable . However , Snowden explained IN DT chemtrail program has been incredibly easy to hide , especially with DT cooperation of jet fuel companies , a crucial part of DT military - industrial complex . Snowden VBD , “ DT chemicals which are released by passenger airplanes have been covertly introduced as ‘ additives , ’ supposedly to improve efficiency . Only as DT plane reaches cruising velocity does DT heat and atmospheric pressure cause a chemical reaction WDT synthesizes DT top secret carbon - trapping molecule . This process is imperfect , and JJ of DT by - products are incredibly dangerous even in trace quantities . DT most dangerous thing is IN although chemtrails are keeping DT NN of DT U.S. reasonably stable , citizens are bombarded every day with an invisible rain of carbon - laden molecules , and DT effect on NN is totally unknown . ”"

This is somewhat understandable since DT two concepts overlap a great deal . In fact , EX is a causal relationship between DT two . However , EX are some subtle and some not - so - subtle differences between JJ NN and NN NN . DT phrase JJ NN is used by NNS to mean a long - term increase in NNP ’s average air temperature . PRP can refer specifically to such NN WDT is due to DT influence of rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in DT atmosphere . NNP ’s surface gets most of its heat from DT NN associated with DT Sun ’s rays , which strike DT NN ’s surface during DT day . At night most of this NN is radiated back into space . Greenhouse gases ( such as carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxides , and chlorofluorocarbons [ CFCs ] ) absorb infrared radiation ( net heat NN ) emitted from NNP ’s surface and radiate PRP back to DT surface , thus contributing to DT greenhouse effect . Though DT recent rise in greenhouse gases in DT atmosphere is arguably DT main factor affecting JJ NN , other factors are involved ( such as variations in NNP ’s orbit , DT angle of DT NN ’s axis , and variations in DT Sun ’s NN output ) . Nevertheless , as higher concentrations of greenhouse gases allow NNP ’s atmosphere to hold on to greater amounts of heat WDT MD normally escape into space at night , NNP ’s average temperature rises . NN NN is a bit different . Before PRP look into what NN NN is , PRP MD be helpful to VB a bit about NN with respect to weather . Weather , which is often confused with NN , is DT set of conditions in DT atmosphere in CD location for a limited period of NN , such as throughout DT day , at night , or at any particular point during DT day . NN , on DT other hand , is DT average condition of DT atmosphere in a given location over a long period of NN , such as 30 NNS or more . Thus , NN NN is a longer - term NN in DT average condition of DT atmosphere . Human beings most certainly contribute to NN NN by adding greenhouse gases to DT atmosphere , but this is only part of DT equation . NNP ’s NN can VB over NN not only because of changes in DT atmosphere but RB because of interactions between DT atmosphere and various geologic , chemical , biological , and geographic factors . For example , regional climates ( as well as NNP ’s JJ NN ) can VB in response to a sustained period of heavy volcanic activity . Much of DT activity is related in turn to DT movement of NNP ’s tectonic plates , which drives DT continents across DT surface of DT NN . Over hundreds of thousands to millions of NNS , DT continents collide with other continents or break apart , changing DT paths of ocean currents and local winds . This affects DT transport of heat from DT tropics to DT poles . NNP ’s JJ NN has RB changed in response to drastic changes in atmospheric chemistry — notably DT rise in oxygen concentrations billions of NNS ago when plants , algae , and other forms of life capable of photosynthesis began to spread across DT NN . As DT NN continues to come to grips with how human activities influence NNP ’s NN , DT tangible effects of NN NN WDT is caused by JJ NN — such as melting glaciers and NN caps , rising NN levels , and changes in seasonal temperature and rainfall patterns — are becoming DT focus . With such disruptions becoming more and more apparent , JJ NNS are discussing them increasingly in terms of real long - term climatic changes rather than simply remarking about NNP ’s average temperature . Consequently , NN NN can RB refer to DT cause - and - effect relationship between JJ NN and NN NN . DT is , PRP can refer to a NN in DT average condition of DT atmosphere brought on by JJ NN ."

With his environmental documentary “ 2040 , ” writer - director Damon Gameau set out to create a letter from DT future , a self - described “ exercise in fact - based dreaming , ” for his 4 - NN - old daughter Velvet . His goal : present Velvet and her generation a positive path for battling NN NN utilizing only solutions WDT are presently available . Gameau initiated this vision of DT future by asking 100 NNS from around DT NN what PRP MD VB 2040 to look IN . He was startled by how aware DT kids ( ages 6 - 11 ) are of DT challenges DT NN is facing and weaves their voices into DT film as an unjaded chorus of boundless potential ( “ Clean NN ! ” “ End deforestation ! ” “ Rocket boots ! ” “ National hot dog day ! ” ) . Turning to experts in various fields , Gameau learns about solar - powered microgrids , localized economies , electric self - driving cars , urban food farms , regenerative agriculture , marine permaculture , resource awareness and increased educational opportunities for girls ( perhaps DT most surprising element presented ) . Every solution is then dramatized as to how PRP might affect DT NN of a 20 - something Velvet . DT effect is inspiring and empowering . Fanciful animation , graphics and special effects , abetted by Gameau ’s down under whimsy , make DT film as entertaining as PRP is educational . Powered by unbridled optimism , Gameau defies skeptics by doing his homework and bringing receipts . Working on DT film in 2019 , Gameau had no idea what 2020 MD look IN . Strangely or not , DT massive uncertainty of DT present only reenforces DT pragmatic arguments of “ 2040 . ” DT status quo is unsustainable , and Gameau illustrates IN transformative NN is not only necessary , but possible ."

From now on she will VB to school on a bicycle , because driving her by car costs fuel , and fuel puts NNS into DT atmosphere . Of course PRP will be winter soon and then she will VB to VB by bus , but cycling through DT freezing builds resilience . Of course , she is now asking for an electric bicycle , but PRP have shown her DT devastation caused to DT areas of DT NN as a result of mining for DT extraction of Lithium and other minerals used to make batteries for electric bicycles , so she will be pedaling , or walking . Which will not harm her , or DT NN . PRP used to cycle and walk to school too . Since DT girl on TV demanded “ PRP need to VB rid of our dependency on fossil fuels ” and our daughter agreed with her , PRP have disconnected DT heat vent in her room . DT temperature is now dropping to twelve degrees in DT evening , and will drop below freezing in DT winter , PRP have promised to buy her an extra sweater , hat , tights , gloves and a blanket . For DT same reason PRP have decided IN from now on she only takes a cold shower . She will wash her clothes by hand , with a wooden washboard , because DT washing machine is simply a power consumer and since DT dryer uses natural gas , she will hang her clothes on DT clothes line to dry , just IN my parents and grandparents used to do . Speaking of clothes , DT ones WDT she currently has are all synthetic , so made from petroleum . Therefore on Monday , PRP will bring all her designer clothing to DT secondhand shop . PRP have found an eco store where DT only clothing PRP sell is made from undyed and unbleached linen and jute . RB ca n’t have clothes made on wool , because DT NNS from farting sheep are supposedly causing bad weather . PRP should n’t matter IN PRP looks good on her , or IN she is VBG to be laughed at , dressing in colorless , bland clothes and without a wireless bra , but DT is DT price she has to pay for DT benefit of DT NNP . Cotton is out of DT question , as PRP comes from distant lands and pesticides are used for PRP . Very bad for DT environment . PRP just saw on her Instagram IN she ’s pretty angry with PRP . This was not our intention . From now on , at 7 p.m. PRP will turn off DT WiFi and PRP will only switch PRP on again DT next day after dinner for two hours . In this way PRP will save on electricity , so she is not bothered by electro - stress and will be totally isolated from DT outside NN . This way , she can concentrate solely on her homework . At eleven o’clock in DT evening PRP will pull DT breaker to shut DT power off to her room , so she knows IN dark is really dark . DT will save a lot of CO2 . She will no longer be participating in winter sports to ski lodges and resorts , nor will she be VBG on anymore vacations with PRP , because our vacation destinations are practically inaccessible by bicycle . Since our daughter fully agrees with DT girl on TV IN DT CO2 NNS and footprints of her great - grandparents are to blame for ‘ killing our NN ’ , what all this simply means , is IN she RB has to live IN her great - grandparents and PRP never had a holiday , a car or even a bicycle . PRP have n’t talked about DT carbon footprint of food yet . Zero CO2 footprint means no meat , no fish and no poultry , but RB no meat substitutes WDT are based on soy ( after all , WDT grows in farmers fields , WDT use machinery to harvest DT beans , trucks to transport to DT processing plants , where more NN is used , then trucked to DT packaging / canning plants , and trucked once again to DT stores ) and RB no imported food , because DT has a negative ecological effect . And absolutely no chocolate from Africa , no coffee from South America and no tea from Asia . Only homegrown potatoes , vegetables and fruit WDT have been grown in local cold soil , because greenhouses run on boilers , piped in CO2 and artificial light . Apparently , these things are RB bad for DT NNP . PRP will teach her how to grow her own food . Bread is still possible , but butter , milk , cheese and yogurt , cottage cheese and cream come from cows and PRP emit CO2 . No more margarine and no oils will be used for DT frying pan , because DT fat is palm oil from plantations in Borneo where rain forests first grew . No NN cream in DT summer . No soft drinks and no NN drinks , as DT bubbles are CO2 . PRP will RB ban all plastic , because PRP comes from chemical factories . Everything made of steel and aluminum must RB be removed . Have PRP ever seen DT amount of NN a blast furnace consumes or an aluminum smelter ? All bad for DT NN ! PRP will replace her memory foam pillow top mattress , with a jute bag filled with straw , with a horse hair pillow . And finally , she will no longer be using makeup , soap , shampoo , cream , lotion , conditioner , toothpaste and medication . Facewashers will all be linen , IN she can wash by hand , with her wooden washboard , just IN her female ancestors did before NN NN made her angry at PRP for destroying her future . In this way PRP will help her to do her part to prevent mass extinction , NN levels rising and DT disappearance of entire ecosystems . If she truly believes she wants to walk DT talk of DT girl on TV , she will gladly accept and happily embrace her JJ way of life . This article was posted : Wednesday , December 4 , 2019 at 5:24 am"

Prickly acacias edge DT plot of land , protecting bone - dry soil from further erosion . Sghaier ’s father once grew olive and fruit trees — varieties WDT mostly shriveled and died under her watch . “ EX has n’t been enough rain in recent NNS , ” says DT 52 - NN - old farmer . Her tiny farm in eastern Tunisia is a bellwether for DT dramatic environmental changes already reshaping North Africa , which threaten to intensify with NN NN . Sandwiched between an encroaching Sahara and a VBG Mediterranean NNP , DT region has seen a sharp drop in rainfall over DT past half century — a trend experts say will likely intensify in DT coming decades . Indeed , over DT course of this century parts of North Africa as well as DT Middle East might become uninhabitable , according to DT German research and policy organization , DT Max Planck Institute . “ PRP ’re seeing higher temperatures and increasing NN stress , ” says Essia Guezzi , NN and NN project officer for conservation group WWF North Africa , summing up some of DT regional challenges . Meanwhile , rising NN levels threaten DT region ’s largely coastal populations , she and others note . These and other issues will come into sharp focus during next month ’s NN summit in Spain , a fellow member of DT Mediterranean region WDT is considered a NN hotspot — more vulnerable to DT effects of NN NN than other parts of DT NN . While Morocco has earned praise as a NN - NN leader , DT North African region overall needs to do much more to counter an otherwise grim future , experts say . RB hampering efforts : some NNS are buffeted by conflict and civil unrest , while fossil fuels continue to drive Algerian and Libyan economies . Trying to turn DT tide In Tunisia , fresh groundwater reserves are shrinking rapidly . Roughly two - thirds of DT land is threatened by desertification . DT effects of NN NN are likely to slow DT country ’s growth , hitting two major revenue drivers — tourism and agriculture — according to a 2018 report by DT Netherlands Foreign Ministry . While Tunisian authorities have outlined ambitious targets — including cutting NNS 41 percent by 2030 compared to 2010 levels — PRP have been slow to match words with action , critics say . Nor did DT issue figure high on candidates ’ priorities in recent legislative and presidential elections . “ PRP seems IN DT environment and DT impact of NN NN is DT last concern of JJ Tunisian politicians , ” says Hamadi Gharbi , WWF North Africa NNP and NNP project manager , who says DT country RB needs more NN financing and expertise . In DT village of Bir Salah , Sghaier is trying , at least locally , to turn DT tide . She and other area farmers began planting hardy acacia trees to help reduce erosion , along with moringa , a fast - growing plant prized for its nutritional and medicinal properties . DT idea was to help fight NN NN and earn a profit doing so . DT reality has not been so easy . “ Everyone likes JJ products , ” Sghaier says , showing a visitor her storeroom packed with moringa oils and powders , along with bags of moringa - based bsissa , a Tunisian breakfast drink , which a group of growers have made and packaged . “ DT problem is selling them , ” she says . “ PRP ’s hard to find a market . ” Across DT Sahara , DT African Union has spearheaded an ambitious ‘ Great Green Wall ’ initiative aimed to restore degraded land across a swathe of DT Sahel , while RB offering income - generating opportunities for communities living RB . “ DT goal is to replant trees , to return DT Sahel to what PRP was about 60 NNS ago , when EX was a lot more forest cover , ” says anthropologist Gilles Boetsch , director of a French scientific team working with Senegalese researchers in DT region . EX are plenty of setbacks he says . JJ trees die and need to be replaced , while conflict in some Sahel NNS makes areas inaccessible . “ PRP does n’t work 100 percent , but PRP works , ” Boetsch says , adding a similar regional initiative MD RB work north of DT Sahara . “ DT first problem is NN . DT second is getting communities to accept DT projects . ” In North Africa , some national projects to fight NN NN are making a difference , and Tunisia will reportedly present a regional oases protection project at DT Madrid NN conference . Local farmers in northern Algeria are getting Mexican expertise to plant prickly pear , a cactus WDT offers a raft of nutritional and money - generating benefits and needs little rainfall . Algeria is RB trying to revive a massive ‘ Green Dam ’ reforestation project WDT previously had disappointing results . In Tunisia ’s southeastern Gabes region , Dhafer Guezguez worked with DT local NN in European Union - financed projects WDT included restoring oases and reintroduce native date palm species . DT plants are hardy and nutritious , he says , but not as sweet as popular commercial varieties . Attracting consumers will need serious marketing . “ PRP need to be showcased as a product WDT ’s rare and good for PRP , ” Guezguez says . “ DT same kind of effort PRP saw in Europe and DT NNP NNPS to VB NNS to eat organic products . ” DT oases preservation initiatives have helped to boost local economies and restore depleted soil , he says . Women dominate DT workforce . DT projects have continued even after EU financing ended . Participants are RB making tourist handicrafts IN palm leaf bags and hats , to earn extra revenue . “ I VBP this is how , little by little , PRP can save DT oases , ” Guezguez says . “ When local communities realize PRP ’s in their interest to do so ."

DT Scriptures so influenced DT Home , DT School , and DT Church of Germany WDT DT national life saw a phenomenal progress . Germany was now making terrific strides in NN , art , and culture . Then came a day when innate conceit got to work . Christianity was emasculated . Christ was rationalized to be nothing more than a good man . DT Holy Scriptures were reduced to a crazy quilt . Religion came to be built on negatives . God was dwarfed and man was deified . ' Let DT strong survive , ' became DT JJ religion . Germany was decivilized and Hitler had no trouble getting his followers to arm to DT hilt to conquer DT NN . "" Let PRP ask DT help of Almighty God in these days when men "" loose wild tongues WDT hold not God in awe , "" when EX are evils WDT MD lead our greatest graces to DT grave and leave DT NN no copy . When DT atheistic deformities of our times MD coerce PRP into substituting for Christianity 's vital bread a chunk of froth scattered by miasmatic winds - lest our country become a despised Ichabod among DT nations of NN . A Church NNP Lose Her Glory "" Thy glory hath departed "" Too bad and too sad when DT is spoken of a church about which glorious things once were spoken . ' Tis tragic , 'tis true IN of some churches such is DT epitaphic description of their decay , their inverted torch , their oil - less lamps , their turning back in DT day of battle - though armed and carrying bows . DT is grief for angels . DT is laughter for devils . DT is gloating for Satan . DT is groaning for Christ 's followers . A church can "" leave its first love "" DT church at Ephesus did - and needed to "" repent and do DT first works "" Revelation 2:4,5 . A church can VB from an army into an ecclesiastical nursery wherein DT preacher is looked upon as a head nurse who has more to do with milk bottles for sickly saints than with mighty battles against seductive Satan . Then does its glory depart . A church can VB from a church of compassionate concern into a church of callisthenic conventionality utterly devoid of devotional vitality - censorious of spiritual and far - sighted leadership , worldly , wayward , and peevishly puny . Then can Ichabod be written over its portals , its pews , its pulpit . A church can VB from a cataract of activity into a scum - covered pond of stagnation . Thus , forgetting IN "" she IN liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth , "" she hastens DT departure of her glory . A church can VB from a church of aggressive conquest into a church possessive of a slothful timidity , a passive acquiescence in small attainments , a criminal spineless in DT face of evils WDT arrogantly challenge , a careless in - difference to great stretches of DT unattained . Thus is Ichabod an appropriate adjective for its activities and aimlessness . A church can be a roller of marbles when PRP should be a remover of mountains . Thus does its spiritual muscle become flabby , its fingers fumbling , its feet halt - as DT glory departs . A church can put its headlight on DT rear and VB only of DT glory WDT was . Then and thus does its light grow dim , its voice faltering , its spiritual ambitions anemic , its worship boresomely lacking in life , its glory NN of DT past . Pathetic DT words WDT fell from DT Master 's lips . "" And as he went out of DT temple , CD of his disciples saith unto him , Master , see what manner of stones and what buildings are here ! And Jesus answering VBD unto him , Seest thou these great buildings ? EX shall not be left CD stone upon another , WDT shall not be thrown down "" Mark 13:1,2 . PRP were great buildings . PRP were magnificent stones . But to his eyes PRP were nothing more than ruins , for DT glory of DT temple 's worship and service had departed . "" But DT Lord VBD unto Samuel , Look not on his countenance , or on DT height of his stature ; because I have refused him : for DT Lord seeth not as man seeth ; for man looketh on DT outward appearance , but DT Lord looketh on DT heart "" - I Sam . 16:7 . Outwardly DT beautiful and stately temple seemed destined to "" defy DT tooth of NN . "" Inwardly PRP was hollow and empty and tottering to its fall . Write "" Ichabod "" upon PRP . Is PRP possible for a church , when God calls PRP to "" launch out into DT deep "" in DT matter of soul - winning , to become "" a drifting sepulcher manned by a frozen crew ? "" Well , when academic luster takes DT place of spiritual passion , when refrigeration is valued above conflagration , such is DT danger . I once heard Dr. Perry Webb say : "" DT atmosphere in some churches is so cold , PRP can skate down DT aisles . "" Is PRP true IN a church MD be noted for DT gorgeous architecture of its building , DT lovely music of its choir , DT stateliness of its ritual , DT fine - functioning of all its organizations , DT largeness of numbers as to its congregation , DT influence in JJ circles of business and social and educational life - and yet be , in DT eyes of Him who marks DT sparrow 's fall , as a corpse wrapped in an ornate shroud ? Of DT church at Sardis , Jesus , risen and enthroned , VBD : "" And unto DT angel of DT church in Sardis write , These things saith he WDT hath DT seven Spirits of God , and DT seven stars ; I VBP thy works , IN thou hast a name WDT thou livest , and art dead . "" - Revelation 3:1 . Somebody described another church IN unto DT church at Sardis in these words : Outwardly splendid as of old - Inwardly sparkless , void and cold - Her force and fire all spent and gone - IN DT dead moon she still shines on . R.T. Ketcham once VBD : "" Attend church , but do not attend a church which prefers NN to Scripture , reason for revelation , theories for truth , culture for conversion , benevolence for blood , goodness for grace , sociability for spirituality , play for praise , pep for prayer , profession for possession , progress for power , reformation for regeneration , good for God , speculation for salvation , jubilation for justification , feelings for faith , paralysis for peace , politics for precepts . "" To this I make additional comment saying IN a church deserves to have Ichabod written from its lowest cellar step to DT sky - touching point of its steeple which prefers DT adulation of saints to ardent anxieties concerning lost sinners as well as abhorrence of DT which is evil . Glory yields up its scepter - when DT fancies of literary notables have place along with DT facts of DT gospel , when EX is DT frivolity of DT flesh instead of DT fervor of DT spiritual in serving DT Lord - godliness in form only instead of glorying in DT cross of Christ - a groping after eternal verities - and a guessing IN only borders on godliness as to DT certainties of God 's promises instead of a guidance of others into paths of righteousness . Glory "" packs its baggage for a CD - way trip "" when in DT church NNS are noted for faultfinding instead of being notable for forgiveness - when offense is quickly taken and EX is overlordism instead of DT offering of self for lowly service - when DT making of money means more than DT mastery of money . How can DT glory of DT church be as a sunlit mountain whose position never changes when in DT church EX is playing at DT job and little praying on DT job - when peevishness and petulance predominate over praise - when EX is quarrelsomeness instead of quietness - when EX is frequent rumpus - raising and riotous revelry instead of restfulness , sinfulness instead of saintliness , selfishness instead of service , tattling instead of testimony , tampering with temptation instead of triumph over temptation . "" Thy glory hath departed "" will be written on NN and known in Heaven of DT church where EX is more yawning over watches than yearning over wanderers - where EX is mere zest and not zealousness in good works . Let PRP so live and give , so love and serve , so watch and pray , IN , if DT individual 's conduct were universalized , PRP MD never be as a hand WDT writes of a church , "" Thy glory hath departed . "" DT true glory of a church consists : "" in DT purity of its members ; in its spiritual progress ; in DT unity of its fellowship ; in DT spiritual NNS born into its household of faith ; in its self - sacrificing spirit toward others ; and in DT prayer life of DT whole group . When a church is in a healthy condition hypocrisy will be limited ; progress in purity will be constant ; strife and discord will disappear ; sympathy for DT lost will seek means for their rescue ; recruits will outnumber DT losses from backsliding , removal , and death ; private devotion will be a pleasure , family religion a joy , and JJ worship a sought delight . "" Along with this let PRP remember IN any church will undergo DT frightful processes of dishonorable self - burial where EX is a lax theology WDT advocates a mutilated Bible , a minimized sin , a deified man , a humanized Christ - substituting human opinions and speculations for DT revealed pronouncements of God concerning DT Bible , concerning DT nature of men , concerning DT terrors of sin , concerning DT deity of Christ , concerning DT meaning of Christ 's death on DT cross , concerning DT plan of salvation , concerning Hell , concerning Heaven . A Home MD Lose Its Glory Yet , glorious as DT glory of a real home is , DT glory can depart - sometimes does depart - assuredly will depart - if DT things "" down under "" Christian ideals , sordidly below Christian standards for a home - VB DT upper hand and put their oppressive heels upon DT virtues which MD weave wedding garments instead of shrouds on DT home loom . Answer these questions : Are EX not JJ homes WDT are polluted reservoirs from which muddy streams WDT carry deadly contamination flow ? Are EX not JJ homes WDT are grindstones on which DT Devil sharpens his weapons of wickedness ? DT glory of a home departs when parents walk on DT edges of mental abysses - talking nonsense . DT glory of a home will assuredly leave a home as a flower wilts under heavy frost - when parents , by neglect or omission in spiritual matters , send NNS out to NN in paper boats , as though seas did not drown , - when parents , in matters momentous as to issue in stainlessness of morals , permit NNS , in daring defiance of Christian conduct , to walk bare - footed on live coals , as though fire did not burn . Today so JJ homes die in houses . Today JJ who VBP better , living for things WDT matter least , neglecting things WDT matter most , are content with houses in which EX are no homes . In pioneer days , wolves often attacked NNS . In remote mountain districts eagles did DT same . Out West Indians attempted to destroy DT home of settlers . On battlefields vultures have eaten DT sons of women . Now vultures of evil literature attack our NNS . Now poisonous serpents are in every pathway PRP tread . Now DT jackals of sex familiarity are fed by precept and example . Now DT leaping leopards of lust ; Now DT vultures of infidelity in ministry and press ; Now barnyard morality ; Now demagogues who ravage DT land ; Now DT buzzards of liquor traffic on every corner - permitted RB by DT NNP NNPS NNP ; Now DT theory of evolution in most schools - evolution , DT antithesis of Christianity ; Now modernism choosing DT livery of Heaven to serve DT Devil in ; Now godless scholarship summoning DT Bible to appear at DT bar of human reason ; Now all these infest our land . All of which is to say IN - no explorer amid DT wilds of DT North , no adventurer amid unexplored jungles , no doctor amid deadly contagions of NN - ever had to face as JJ dangers as our NNS of today face : their morals , their spiritual welfare , their mental wealth , their soul 's salvation considered . Parental delinquency makes glory depart from a home . Are PRP unfair to say IN behind every delinquent child is a delinquent parent ? Are PRP ceasing to tell DT truth when PRP say IN behind every broken youth is a broken home ? Do PRP not speak words of truth when PRP say IN behind every broken home is a neglect of God in DT home ? When a fifteen - NN - old unmarried girl , pregnant with child , stands before DT court and VBZ IN she does not consider she has done wrong - no more than thousands of other young girls are doing - where are DT mothers ? When a fourteen - NN - old boy , apprehended for roaming DT streets of a city at early morning hours , stands before DT court with tears in his eyes and asks to be sent to DT NN school - because he knows he MD be happier RB than in his own home - where is DT father ? When young girls smoke a pack of cigarettes a day and dress so skimpily PRP attract DT attention of every goggle - eyed man and boy - do not their mothers DT same ? When boys argue over DT relative "" values "" and "" quick - stirring "" powers of advertised brands of liquor - do not their fathers drink booze and vote for legalizing PRP , forgetting IN PRP can control a powder can in a fire as easily as PRP can control booze ? Is EX not too much laxness on DT part of parents toward spiritual values ? Often NNS are allowed to stay out of Sunday School and to miss church services - to remain in almost complete ignorance of DT spiritual values . Is PRP not perilous to NNS , this easy - come , easy - VB attitude of parents ? Is not DT use of intoxicating beverages CD of DT greatest evils responsible for juvenile delinquency ? Are not NNS from homes where indiscriminate drinking is done sent out to "" play DT game "" with two strikes against them ? Do not thinking NNS believe IN youth delinquency MD be negligible if PRP were not for delinquent adults , especially delinquent parents ? Can CD pass judgment on these young NNS without indictment of ourselves for failure somewhere down DT line ? Do not boys and girls VB into trouble when too much leisure NN is theirs ? Are not city governments extremely unwise to say PRP have no money for further improvement of playgrounds while PRP allot large sums of taxpayers ' money for DT cost of punishing DT youth for committing crimes ? Is PRP not shortsightedness bordering on imbecility to pay so much for DT cost of juvenile delinquency and so little for its prevention ? "" Any law should be so framed to penalize DT delinquent parent as well as DT delinquent child . . . PRP must first give God his rightful place in DT American home ... Until DT cardinal principles of God are implanted in DT hearts of DT youth of our nation ... until EX is instilled in DT hearts of DT parents of these youth a God - JJ sense of responsibility in DT home , PRP shall continue to experience wave upon wave of crime , mounting and growing steadily day by day , until PRP reaches a magnitude beyond DT scope of DT law - enforcement agencies and DT American NNS to control . "" But if parents distinguish themselves by DT profession of truth , DT worship of God , DT practice of virtue , PRP will be sure to draw others after them ; whereas if PRP are irreligious and un-Christian , PRP are infested fountains WDT poison . Parents can no more dispense with personal piety without malicious influence on NNS than a tree can dispense with sap and bear fruit . Adam and Eve sinned ! And Cain became a murderer . Had PRP not sinned , Abel MD have lived . If a rock is a quotation from DT quarry , if a flower is a quotation from DT garden , if a tree is a quotation from DT forest , if a bird is a quotation from DT flock , if every child is a quotation of his parents - what sort do DT NNS make PRP ? Today DT situation is desperate . Character is at a premium in DT land . Criminality of all kinds is rampant . DT daily prints are filled with record of deeds almost too revolting for JJ consumption . An ever - rising wave of lawlessness is hurling its weight against DT bulwarks of DT nation . Much of this is because of godless homes - because too JJ fathers and mothers have abdicated . How parents ought to rejoice for DT opportunity of living close to God , of hearing DT motion of angel 's wings in DT patter of little NNS , and of being Christlike in DT home . Glory in a home is made secure when Christian conduct is evident . Unless PRP serve God yourselves as parents PRP will plant vines on which will grow grapes of bitterness . "" What mean ye , IN ye use this proverb concerning DT land of Israel , saying , DT fathers have eaten sour grapes , and DT NNS 's teeth are set on edge ? "" Ezekiel 18:2 Nothing is so infectious as example : "" PRP can do more good by being good than in any other way "" ( Kingsley ) . "" A father who whipped his son for swearing and swore while he whipped him , did more harm by his example than good by his correction "" ( Fuller ) . "" Noble examples stir PRP up to noble actions "" ( Burke ) . "" Live with wolves and PRP will learn to howl . "" A drinking or drunken father is a poor preacher of sobriety to sons . A proud father is a miserable recommender of humility to sons . PRP will do as PRP do rather than as PRP say . Your example will counteract all DT effect of your counsel - and all DT convictions PRP MD fix in DT mind will fall IN arrows from an impenetrable shield . PRP should therefore begin "" both to do and to teach . "" PRP should be able , in a humble measure , at least , to say to those under your care : "" Be ye followers of me , even as I RB am of Christ ... "" "" Thou therefore which teachest another , teachest thou not thyself ? Thou IN preachest a man should not steal , dost thou steal ? Thou DT sayest a man should not commit adultery , dost thou commit adultery ? Thou DT abhorrest idols , dost thou commit sacrilege ? Thou DT makest thy boast of DT law , through breaking DT law dishonourest thou God ? "" Romans 2:21 - 23 If parents suffered their NNS to VB naked , to beg their bread , to lie unattended in sickness , to perish with hunger in a ditch , PRP MD be shunned as monsters . But parents act a far more criminal and a far more infamous part by disregarding their spiritual and everlasting welfare . Doubtless Herod , after killing DT infants in Bethlehem , was viewed and shunned with horror . But he was far less cruel than some modern parents . He only destroyed DT body . "" But PRP any provide not for his own , and specially for those of his own house , be hath denied DT faith , and is worse than an infidel . "" I Timothy 5:8 . Let PRP remember and teach others to remember - lest glory depart from our dwellings - IN EX is a difference in a house and a home : IN a house is built by human hands but a home is built by human hearts , IN a house is built of visible materials but a home is built of DT invisible things of DT Spirit ; IN a house MD be destroyed , but fire and flood and earthquake and storm can not destroy a real home ; IN EX is only CD calamity can ruin a home , DT death of love ; IN DT real food of a home is not meat and bread but thoughtfulness and unselfishness . DT basis for Christianity in DT home , DT preventative of departed glory , is Jesus and DT church . Can EX be a real Christian home without union with DT church ? Can EX be Christian homes without churchgoing as a habit as well as a duty and a privilege ? Jesus had DT habit of churchgoing , for 'tis written : "" He was in DT synagogue as was his custom on DT Sabbath day . "" When I was a boy PRP was as natural to VB to church on Sunday as PRP was to work on Monday or to play games on Saturday afternoon , but DT present idea is IN PRP is a terrible thing , a species of mental and physical punishment . Dr. Macartney tells how when Grover Cleveland lay dying at Princeton , his mind reverted , not to any of DT fierce political battles through which he had passed , nor to DT presidential honors and burdens which he had borne , but to DT old home in DT Presbyterian manse , where his minister father at family worship prayed for DT eternal salvation of his NNS . DT dying man asked IN a copy of DT hymnbook out of which PRP used to sing be procured , so IN with its music and its memories he might face DT eternal NN . And then this great preacher says : "" All kinds of doctors are abroad today with all kinds of remedies for our national and social diseases . But a filled family pew in God 's house on DT Lord 's day is DT best thing WDT can ever happen to a family , a city , or a nation . "" An Individual NNP Lose DT Glory PRP is possible for an individual so to live WDT PRP can be VBN in NN and declared in Heaven : "" Thy glory has departed "" - as light departs from a lamp in which EX is no oil , as fruitfulness departs from a tree wherein is no sap . DT old poet must have had some experience of this truth when he wrote : I remember , I remember , But now 'tis little joy To VB I 'm farther off from Heaven Than when I was a boy . What tragedy when "" Ichabod "" - "" Thy glory hath departed "" - is written above and over a once - believing heart ! What sorrow sufficient to make angels weep - when "" thy - glory - hath - departed "" is DT autobiography of a life once faithful , once loyal , once devoted . What cause for grief when DT life once a life of unselfish service becomes a life of stagnant selfishness - a life WDT centers in self . What tragedy for NN and man and God when DT life once possessed of DT fruit of DT Spirit - "" love , joy , peace , longsuffering , gentleness , meekness , goodness , faith , self - control "" - is now a life in which is manifest DT works of DT flesh - "" adultery , fornication , uncleanness , lasciviousness , idolatry , witchcraft , hatred , variance , emulations , wrath , strife , seditions , heresies , envying , murders , drunkenness , reveling , and such JJ . "" Yet IN PRP see , IN PRP find , in DT lives of some individuals who have gone from PRP - and in DT lives of some who now live in our midst . So JJ who call themselves Christians have lost DT old - NN glow . With them DT sacred fervor of other NNS is lacking . Men and women RB are who once believed in prayer and believed IN PRP forfeit peace and bear needless pain because PRP do not carry everything to God in prayer ; but now PRP are prayerless altogether or are weak in prayer and look upon PRP as a useless exercise . NNS I VBP who , when PRP were young , believed DT Bible to be DT Word of God - infinite in scope , infallible in authority , regenerative in power , personal in application - who now say IN PRP is a book of myths and allegories . Of them 'tis tragically true PRP have hewn themselves cisterns where no NN is and have forsaken DT fountain of living waters . I VBP young NNS who have attended schools WDT once , in DT days of our forefathers , were bulwarks for DT most holy faith . Entering these schools PRP were believers in DT miraculous and DT supernatural , but now , deceived by DT evil seducers who wooed and won them with strange and fantastic myths , PRP are adrift - without chart or compass . From them DT glory hath departed , even as PRP had departed from schools which serve DT Devil in DT livery of Heaven . Instead of believing DT certainties of God 's Word , PRP put their trust in DT unscriptural surmises of men . Instead of feeding on God 's Word , PRP have grown lean on DT diet of quips given them by those who , calling themselves scholarly teachers , plant "" probabilities "" and "" perhapses "" and "" maybes "" or "" not - at - alls "" in DT minds of youth . Thus has glory departed from DT teachers and from DT taught . Thus has glory departed from DT schools in which these teachers teach . DT students so taught and DT teachers who , IN vandals , break into DT house of their faith should realize IN man 's wisdom is to be laughed at . How glory departs from an individual , or a multitude of individuals when PRP depart from DT teaching of DT supernaturalistic school , championed by orthodox Christians contending IN Christ is DT God-man - to line up with DT materialistic school , championed by evolutionists . VB of Judas - DT incarnation of infamy today ! Shakespeare called him "" DT base Judean who sold a pearl richer than all his tribe . "" Judas , given a great opportunity by Christ Himself , had part of "" DT ministry and apostleship on which angels longed to serve . "" Did not this position place its participant on a level with Moses and Elijah ? But DT glory of this individual began to grow dim when he began to wonder about DT course WDT Jesus chose in refusing DT kingship and in antagonizing DT rulers . DT glory grew even dimmer when he began to worry about DT future - and dimmer still when he began to pilfer DT bag . And his glory departed completely when he went out into DT night to bargain to betray Jesus for DT price of a hog ! Truly over PRP all PRP can write : "" Thy glory hath departed . "" And VB of Lot - called just and righteous . "" And delivered just Lot , vexed with DT filthy conversation of DT wicked ( for DT righteous man dwelling among them , in seeing and hearing , vexed his righteous soul from day to day , with their unlawful deeds . ) "" He was driven to Egypt when famine came , yet his soul in JJ ways became a famished soul . A businessman , an opportunist , maker of a bad choice WDT he thought was a good choice . He certainly added no brightness to manhood 's torch by marrying a woman of Sodom - DT wickedest city mentioned in man 's literature , hopelessly corrupt . Lot escaped with only his family when God burned Sodom to DT ground . Lot 's last act was CD of incest . From his daughters came DT nations of Ammon and Moab . And VB of Saul - first king of Israel . His glory , which was as a burning bush of splendor , faded into lusterless cold ashes . Let PRP see what DT Scriptures tell PRP : "" And DT Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons ; and DT Philistines slew Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Melchishua , Saul 's sons . And DT battle went sore against Saul , and DT archers hit him ; and he was sore wounded of DT archers . Then VBD Saul unto his Armour bearer , Draw thy sword , and thrust me through therewith ; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and abuse me . But his Armour bearer MD not ; for he was sore afraid . Therefore Saul took a sword , and fell upon PRP "" I Samuel 31:2 - 4 . Again and again , with tragic repetition , do DT pages of history testify IN individuals who once gave light as steady stars came to DT NN and place where their light was DT flame of a fluttering candle . In our churches PRP see NNS who once served faithfully who proved their kinship with Demas - to DT hurt of some and to DT sorrow of JJ . In some homes PRP have those who once held as sacred DT marital vow who have gone as wild as DT winds which VBP no barriers in making these vows perjury . ' Tis true IN JJ VBP not , or , if knowing , give no heed to DT truth WDT to leave Jesus out of life is to say good - by to glory . Against all things and against all evils WDT bring NNS to DT place and NN where PRP say good - by to glory , I MD IN all men MD take an unwavering stand remembering God 's promise : "" And PRP shall fight against thee ; but PRP shall not prevail against thee ; for I am with thee , saith DT Lord , to deliver thee .

Ecuador set a NN record in 2017 for planting a whopping 647,250 trees in a single day . RB in 2017 , more than 1.5 million volunteers came together to plant 66 million trees in just 12 hours , setting another NN record . • WWF : NNP Has Lost 50 % of its Wildlife in DT Past 40 NNS Now , NASA is reporting IN in DT findings of a 20 - NN NN of DT NN , EX are actually more trees today than EX were two decades ago , thanks in large part to DT efforts of NNS and communities in India and NNP . DT findings are DT result of 20 NNS of data collection from NASA instruments onboard two satellites orbiting NN . A more detailed explanation from DT NN : “ Satellite data show increasing leaf area of vegetation due to direct factors ( human land - use management ) and indirect factors ( such as NN NN , CO2 fertilization , nitrogen deposition and recovery from natural disturbances ) . Among these , NN NN and CO2 fertilization effects seem to be DT dominant drivers . However , recent satellite data ( 2000 – 2017 ) reveal a greening pattern WDT is strikingly prominent in NNP and India and overlaps with croplands NN - wide . NNP alone accounts for 25 % of DT JJ net increase in leaf area with only 6.6 % of JJ vegetated area . DT greening in NNP is from forests ( 42 % ) and croplands ( 32 % ) , but in India is mostly from croplands ( 82 % ) with minor contribution from forests ( 4.4 % ) . “ [ Source ] Furthermore , DT NN serves as a positive counter to DT trend of pollution and environmental degradation PRP see today in Asia : DT satellites have recorded photos of DT NN every day for 20 NNS , creating a massive data set WDT is allowing researchers and biologists to better understand how to preserve DT NN ’s forests . “ This long - term data lets PRP dig deeper , ” VBD Rama Nemani , a research scientist at NASA ’s Ames Research Center and a co-author of DT JJ work . “ When DT greening of DT NNP was first observed , PRP thought PRP was due to a warmer , wetter NN and fertilization from DT added carbon dioxide in DT atmosphere , leading to more leaf growth in northern forests , for instance . Now , with DT MODIS data WDT lets PRP understand DT phenomenon at really small scales , PRP see IN humans are RB contributing . ” DT message is clear : if PRP come together PRP can easily remedy DT ecological problems PRP have created here on NN . Let this good NN serve as an inspiration to participate in DT re-greening of NN . PRP RB demonstrates how humans can address serious problems once PRP become aware of what ’s really VBG on .

In 2018 , NNS and leaders from across DT NN published a report showing how a 1.5 °C increase in JJ temperatures from pre-industrial levels is devastating our environment . PRP are facing more extreme weather , food shortages , rising NN levels and mass extinction of plants and animals , to name a few impacts . DT report below explains DT undeniable link between human activities and this temperature increase . DT report RB calls for drastic changes in policy to prevent further damage to our environment . Read DT special report ' JJ NN of 1.5 ºC ' IPCC on DT IPCC website . In response , our NN has recommended a ‘ net zero ’ target for greenhouse gases . CO2 ( carbon dioxide ) is DT main gas produced by human activities . Find out more on DT causes of NN NN on DT European Commission website . Our NN recognises IN , to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas NNS , PRP all need to VB . DT good thing is PRP already have DT answers PRP need to tackle NN NN and environmental degradation . All PRP takes is DT will to act now . Across DT NN DT impacts of NN NN are being felt in various ways . In some NNS , PRP are seeing shifting weather patterns WDT threaten food production . Elsewhere , rapid glacier melt threatens NN level rise WDT risks catastrophic flooding . Currently DT impacts of NN NN are worse in poorer NNS . Nonetheless , PRP is likely IN NN NN will increasingly affect DT UK in NNS to come . Impacts PRP is likely PRP will see include : • Very cold winters will be rare . • Winters will be wetter and summers will be hotter and more prolonged . • NN level MD rise by 40 cm , leading to coastal erosion and flood risks . • Temperature increase will VB DT crops PRP grow , impacting our diets . • Changes in temperature will cause different illnesses , creating more problems for NNS and DT elderly . • Foreign diseases associated with hot weather migrating north , for example , Malaria . • Cost of living to increase due to food , fuel and NN shortages . • Homes potentially damaged and insurance will increase due to severe weather . • Domestic crops will begin to struggle due to weather NN . • Soil will be less fertile as PRP struggle to grow crops WDT no longer thrive . • Some species cannot adapt to changes . • DT plants and trees WDT can grow will VB . • Dubbed as DT “ evil twin of NN NN "" . • DT ongoing decrease in ocean pH , 30 % decrease so far . • Predicted 150 % by 2100 which has not been experienced for 400,000 NNS . • Wide implications for ocean life , particularly animals with shells or skeletons . While NN NN is JJ in scale , Eden is no stranger to DT impacts . DT 2005 , 2009 and 2016 floods had damaging impacts across DT district . PRP have suffered social , JJ and environmental losses . PRP is predicted similar flooding MD become more common as temperatures increase . In December 2015 , Storm Desmond caused disruptions across Eden and Cumbria . PRP impacted homes and businesses for months after DT event . DT NNP NNP Act of 2008 was passed by our NN to ensure IN PRP keep greenhouse gas NNS at least 80 % lower than DT 1990 baseline by 2050 , to avoid dangerous NN NN . DT Act made DT UK DT first country with a legally binding framework to cut carbon NNS . Alongside this Act , DT Committee on NNP NNP was set up to advise DT NN on legislation and progress on reducing NNS . DT UK has struggled to meet carbon targets set in this act , even though DT need is getting stronger . NN NN effects are being experienced in our country , which PRP now must adapt to . Our experience of NN NN has already created costs to our economy , society and environment . PRP must work to mitigate against NN NN , as well as adapt to DT impacts WDT PRP already experience . Mitigation : reducing NN NN Reducing greenhouse gas NNS : NN efficiency , renewable NN , lower consumption rates , electric cars . Enhancing our carbon sinks : planting trees and carbon sequestering plants , invest in carbon capture technology . Adaptation : adapting to life with NN NN Reduce our vulnerability to harmful effects .

With non -stop coverage of DT latest doomsday doyenne DT powers - who - should - not - be have strutted out on DT stage , PRP ’s easy to forget just how JJ times dire warnings have been issued about how DT NNP ’s NN was on DT verge of wiping out all life on DT NN . For those of PRP fed up with DT grating gyrations of Greta Thunberg ( DT troubled teenager being used by NN - VB Chicken Little leftists IN George Soros and Bill Gates ) , here are some nasty little facts DT NN - run NN MD love to keep under wraps . A few months after DT Wizard of Oz had its theatrical premiere in Green Bay , Wisc. in 1939 , a newspaper headline appeared as follows : “ Greenland ’s Glaciers Melting , Says Scientist . ” “ All DT glaciers in Eastern Greenland are rapidly melting , declared Prof. Hans Ahlmann , Swedish geologist , ” DT article screamed . “ PRP MD without exaggeration be VBN IN DT glaciers , IN those in Norway , face DT possibility of a catastrophic collapse , ” Ahlmann crowed . PRP just love DT word catastrophe , do n’t PRP ? Seven - and - a- half NNS later , Ahlmann — feted and touted by those much smarter than PRP — was at PRP again , issuing his dire warnings : “ DT possibility of a prodigious rise in DT surface of DT ocean with resultant widespread inundation , arising from an Arctic NN phenomenon was discussed yesterday by Dr. Hans Ahlmann , a noted Swedish geophysicist at DT University of California Geophysical Institute . A mysterious NN of DT NN was slowly manifesting itself in DT Arctic , ” stated Ahlmann , who warned IN “ oceanic surfaces MD rise to catastrophic proportions and NNS living in DT [ Greenland ] lowlands . . . MD be inundated . ” PRP ’s no mystery , Hans ; PRP ’s nature . “ Polar NN Thaw Increasing : Glaciers VBD To Be Melting , ” VBD DT headline . This NN , Arctic expert Dr. William S. Carlson VBD IN “ DT Polar icecaps were melting at an astonishing and unexplained rate and were threatening to swamp seaports by raising DT ocean levels . ” PRP ’re still waiting , Bill . Arctic explorer Adm. Donald McMillan was next to warn , stating , “ EX are now 6 million square miles of NN in DT Arctic . EX once were 12 million square miles . ” Perhaps realizing their dire predictions were not panning out , DT “ experts ” were no longer warning of JJ NN , but had switched to JJ cooling , and a coming NN age ! PRP ca n’t make this stuff up . DT next expert trotted out was James P. Lodge Jr. , a scientist at DT National Center for Atmospheric Research . In an article titled “ Scientist Predicts a NNP NNP Age by 21st century , ” Lodge warned IN “ [ a ] ir pollution MD obliterate DT Sun and cause a JJ NN age in DT first third of DT JJ century . ” Uh , Jim , can PRP pass me those sunglasses ? Things were so dire in DT 1970s IN two of DT nation ’s top geologists found PRP necessary to alert NNP Richard Nixon of DT impending doom . “ [ A ] JJ deterioration of NN , by order of magnitude larger than any hitherto experienced by civilized mankind , is a very real possibility and indeed MD be due very soon . DT present rate of cooling , ” PRP warned , “ seems fast enough to bring glacial temperatures in about a century , if continuing at DT present pace . ” By now , most of DT fake NN NN was on DT bandwagon , running story after story on predictions of DT coming NN age . “ An international team of specialists has concluded from eight indexes of NN IN EX is no end in sight to DT cooling trend of DT last 30 NNS , at least in DT Northern Hemisphere , ” squawked DT nation ’s “ newspaper of record . ” DT following NN , “ DT Gray Lady ” reversed course , predicting an Arctic meltdown , “ blaming JJ NN caused by carbon dioxide NNS . . . . EX is a real possibility IN some NNS now in their infancy will live to a NN when DT NN at DT North Pole will have melted , a NN WDT MD cause swift and perhaps catastrophic changes in NN . ” EX ’s DT word “ catastrophic ’ again . Not yet synched to spew identical nonsense , DT Chicago Tribune still thought JJ cooling was DT way to VB , and “ reported ” some more unfounded , dire warnings about a freezing NN . Toward DT end of DT 1980s , however , DT JJ NN playbook was adopted by all in DT fake NN NN , who have been constantly predicting polar icecap “ melting on a catastrophic scale . ” And of course , our good friends in DT fake NN NN MD never put DT below in their fine papers or networks : In a Sept. 24 , Breitbart NNP Network headline , “ 500 NNS Write UN : ‘ EX Is No NN Emergency , ’ ” DT only NN platform with some heft reported on DT letter sent from DT oft - overlooked “ NNS and professionals in NN and related fields ” to DT NNP Nations , “ asking for a long - overdue , high - level , open debate on NN NN . ” DT two - page letter should have been splattered across DT pages and screens of all DT major NN , but here ’s why PRP was n’t , as revealed by its main points : • EX is no NN emergency . • NN is far slower than predicted . • CO2 is plant food , DT basis of all life on NNP . • Natural as well as anthropogenic factors cause NN of DT NNP . A wise man once VBD , “ If PRP tell a lie big enough and keep repeating PRP , NNS will eventually come to believe PRP . ” Another wise man once VBD , “ Freedom of DT press is guaranteed only to those who own CD . ” Thank God EX are honest alternative NN outlets IN American Free Press still publishing DT truth about contentious topics . Dave Gahary , a former submariner in DT U.S. Navy , prevailed in a suit brought by DT NNP York Stock Exchange in an attempt to silence him . Dave is DT producer of an upcoming full - length feature film about DT attack on DT USS Liberty .

By 2050 , PRP 's estimated IN almost CD in four English football league grounds can expect flooding every NN . But tennis , rugby , athletics and winter sports will RB face serious challenges from DT impacts of rising temperatures , DT author says . DT NN finds IN sports leaders are , in DT main , failing to address DT issue seriously . While DT NNP - CD pandemic has disrupted sports as much as any other aspect of social life , JJ experts believe IN this is just a dress rehearsal for DT long - term impacts on sport of a NN WDT 's way too hot . Extreme weather events , related to rising temperatures , have already disrupted some of DT NN 's most high - profile sports in recent NNS . A typhoon , which wreaked havoc in Japan last NN , RB affected fixtures at DT Rugby Union NNP being held RB . Smoke from bush fires stopped play at DT Australian Tennis Open at DT start of this NN . These and JJ other instances are a foretaste of DT future , according to this JJ NN compiled by academic and author David Goldblatt . As football slowly recovers from DT NN crisis , his analysis shows IN 23 of 92 English football league clubs will face partial or total annual flooding of their stadiums by 2050 . In DT current Premier League , DT home grounds of Southampton , Norwich , Chelsea and West Ham face a similar threat . Cricket faces huge challenges globally as temperatures rise in places IN India , Australia and DT West Indies . Venues in Adelaide and Perth will see a 60 % increase in days with temperatures over 40C over DT next decade . In golf , CD in three British Open courses will be damaged by rising sea-levels , DT report says . Researchers say IN of DT CD venues WDT have already hosted DT Winter Olympics , just 10 will be able to hold them by 2050 . But as well as showing DT likely impacts of NN NN on sports , DT JJ NN RB looks at DT contribution WDT DT sporting industry makes to carbon NNS . DT author says IN DT scale of CO2 is equivalent to a country IN Bolivia at DT low end but as large as a country IN Spain on DT high end . DT estimations are likely an underestimate as PRP exclude DT JJ sportswear and sports broadcasting industries , who have impacts on carbon WDT are difficult to calculate . Whatever DT size of its carbon footprint , DT cultural significance of sport gives PRP a tremendous platform to effect NN , says DT author . "" Sport MD be just big enough to register , in terms of carbon NNS , as a small nation NN , or a single megacity , but its own efforts are just a fraction of a percentage point of DT NN total , "" VBD David Goldblatt . "" Making a carbon zero NN DT common sense priority of DT sports NN MD make a huge contribution to making PRP DT common sense priority of all politics , "" he VBD . While some organisations including DT International Olympic Committee and FIFA have signed up to a UN action plan to make sport carbon neutral by 2050 , DT majority of sports authorities have not . DT International Cricket Council is CD of those who have not signed up . Among winter sports , only DT NN hockey and skiing federations have joined , "" which makes CD wonder what DT NNS in charge of luge and bobsleigh VBP PRP are VBG to be sliding on in DT future , "" DT report waspishly notes . DT report was commissioned by DT Rapid Transition Alliance , a international group of academics and campaigners who argue for a faster response to NN NN . "" A first step MD be to bring an end to sponsorship from fossil fuel companies and products promoting fossil fuel intensive lifestyles , "" VBD Andrew Simms from DT group . "" If players RB speak out and say PRP believe clean air and a stable NN matter , millions more will see DT possibilities for NN . PRP will not only send a message of hope for DT wider NN , but PRP will help to guarantee a NN WDT is safe for sport . """

A lawsuit filed by 16 Alaska youths claimed long - term effects of NN NN will devastate DT country 's northernmost NN and interfere with their constitutional rights to life , liberty and JJ trust resources WDT sustain them . DT NN 's legislative and executive branches have not taken steps to lower greenhouse gas NNS and adopted a policy WDT promotes putting more in DT air , VBD attorney Andrew Welle of DT Oregon - based Our NNP 's Trust group . "" This is an issue WDT is squarely within DT court 's authority , "" Welle VBD . Assistant Attorney General Anna Jay urged justices to affirm a lower court ruling rejecting DT claims . Ultimately , DT NN NN issues raised by Alaska youth must be addressed by DT political branches of NN , she VBD . "" DT court does not have DT tools to engage in DT type of legislative policy making endeavor required to formulate a broad NN approach to greenhouse gas NNS , "" she VBD . DT 16 youths sued in 2017 and claimed damages by greenhouse gas NNS are causing widespread damage in Alaska . DT lawsuit VBD DT NN has experienced dangerously high temperatures , changed rain and snow patterns , rising seas , storm surge flooding , thawed permafrost , coastal erosion , violent storms and increased wildfires . Our NNS 's Trust is a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting natural systems for present and future generations . DT group in 2011 unsuccessfully sued DT NN in 2011 , claiming DT NN failed to adopt measures to protect young NNS from NN NN . DT judge in DT case concluded IN courts lack scientific , JJ and technological resources WDT agencies can use to determine NN policy and PRP was best left in their hands . Alaska has no NN sales or income tax and historically has relied on DT petroleum industry , which extracts crude oil and sends most of PRP to West Coast Refineries , for much of its revenue . Welle VBD NN policy promoting fossil fuels , expressed in a NN statute , should be declared unconstitutional because PRP harms young Alaskans by trading short - term financial gains for long - term NN problems . DT lead client in DT case , Esau Sinnok , has had his constitutional right to NN and happiness denied by NN policy and lack of action on NN NN , Welle VBD . "" His home village of Shishmaref is literally wiped off DT map because of NN NN , "" Welle VBD before DT hearing . "" PRP 's endangering his culture , DT very existence of his community , DT NN and safety of him and his community members . "" Justice Peter Maassen asked Welle if DT NN policy was balanced by other policies in NN law , such as protection for natural resources and DT environment . "" How can PRP conclude IN NN agencies are following DT NN policy blindly without consideration of these other policies ? "" Maassen asked . Welle VBD IN while statutes provide authority to protect DT environment , NN agencies have been directed to systemically promote fossil fuels . Justice Susan Carney called Welle 's attention to a newspaper opinion piece by former Gov. Bill Walker in which he acknowledged severe JJ effects of NN NN . "" Is n't DT a sign IN NN policy has balanced those concerns ? "" she asked . Welle replied IN DT court when assessing NN policies , and their effects on fundamental constitutional rights , can assess DT process , look at decisions and decide if balance struck is DT most narrowly tailored choice . This story has been corrected to say IN 16 Alaska youths in 2017 sued DT NN ."

In a JJ NN , an international group of researchers analyzed fossil records to track how DT NN ’s vegetation changed as NNP climbed out of DT last NN age thousands of NNS ago . Then , DT NNS used their data to predict how vegetation in DT future — and everything dependent on PRP — will RB VB . [ 6 Unexpected Effects of NNP NNP ] DT NN is headed into uncharted territory , with "" no analog conditions "" in terms of NN , VBD NN co-author Jonathan Overpeck , DT dean of DT School for Environment and Sustainability at DT University of Michigan . "" PRP makes PRP a lot harder for PRP to be sure what 's VBG to happen next . "" DT fossil records show IN DT NN is very sensitive to temperature changes , which suggests IN if fossil fuel NNS continue unabated , accelerated NN MD lead to dramatic transformations in vegetation and ecosystems around DT globe , DT team wrote today ( Aug. 30 ) in DT journal NNP . Subsequently , DT NN MD lead to changes in DT amount of carbon WDT plants can store , DT available NN supply and DT JJ biodiversity WDT PRP depend on not only for a healthy , functioning ecosystem , but RB for medicine , food and building materials , Overpeck told Live NNP . From DT peak of DT last NN age , 21,000 NNS ago , to DT early Holocene epoch — DT current geological age — DT NN warmed by around 4 to 7 degrees Celsius ( 7 to 13 degrees Fahrenheit ) . If greenhouse gases are n't substantially reduced , DT magnitude of NN WDT occurred over DT course of 11,000 NNS following DT end of DT NN age will happen over a much shorter period : 100 to 150 NNS . To decipher how plant life changed in DT past , DT researchers analyzed ancient pollen and plant fossils from nearly 600 sites on every continent except Antarctica . DT investigators divided DT changes PRP observed into two categories : compositional changes , or changes in plant species in DT area , and large structural changes , IN a tundra becoming a forest or a deciduous forest becoming an evergreen forest . DT various changes were classified as "" large , "" "" moderate "" or "" low . "" Then , focusing on DT sites with moderate or large changes , DT NNS further classified DT sites , this NN addressing DT role NN NN MD have played in DT shifts . PRP used DT same scale for DT role of NN ( low , moderate or large ) . In other words , DT researchers sought to determine whether DT large changes were due to NN NN or DT result of , for example , human activity or large animals . DT researchers found IN DT NN period after DT last NN age played a large role in vegetation changes around DT NN . Areas WDT had DT greatest temperature changes RB tended to be those with DT greatest vegetation changes , DT NN showed . Indeed , DT NNS found IN NN temperatures largely changed DT composition of DT vegetation in 71 percent of DT sites around DT NN and DT structure of DT vegetation in 67 percent of DT sites ; rising temperatures moderately changed DT composition in another 27 percent of DT sites and DT structure in 28 percent of DT sites . DT changes in plant life were most evident in mid to high latitudes in DT Northern Hemisphere , as well as in southern South America , tropical and temperate southern Africa , DT Indo - Pacific region , Australia , NNP Zealand and other NNS in Oceania . EX were RB some sites WDT showed very little compositional or structural NN in vegetation , according to DT paper . But nearly all sites with low compositional NN RB experienced low temperature changes . This shows IN our NN is highly sensitive to temperature changes , Overpeck VBD . Even if PRP end up curbing fossil fuel NNS and meeting DT targets of DT Paris Agreement , some NN is still inevitable , but PRP MD affect less than half DT NN , he VBD . In contrast , if PRP do n't meet DT Paris targets , "" then PRP 'll have much wider NN around DT NN . "" And DT NN will be much bigger and more difficult to predict . Peter Verburg , a professor of environmental geography at DT University of Amsterdam who was not part of DT research , VBD IN PRP 's difficult to extrapolate DT NN 's findings to DT present day . DT NN was "" based on paleo [ lithic ] conditions , and DT present - day vegetation is incomparable [ to DT vegetation in those conditions ] as human activities have changed land cover in some way in about 80 percent of DT terrestrial surface , "" Verburg told Live NNP in an email . "" Nevertheless , what PRP learn is IN ecosystems are extremely sensitive to changes in NN , "" he VBD . Indeed , DT JJ NN is "" another confirmation IN NN NN will hugely affect DT NNP system and DT ecosystems PRP depend on , "" Verburg VBD . In other words , PRP is yet "" another call for immediate action . "" Overpeck VBD IN DT results of this NN likely underestimate DT NN WDT will happen in DT future if PRP do n't curb NNS . "" EX are JJ reasons why these forests are VBG to have a rougher NN [ adapting to NN NN ] in DT future than PRP had in DT past , "" Overpeck VBD , but perhaps DT major reason is IN DT NN frame is sped up so significantly . DT makes PRP a lot harder for DT ecosystem to adjust . And PRP 're already seeing some changes in plant life today , Overpeck VBD . DT NN of DT NN is creating dryer ecosystems in certain parts of DT NN , IN DT western U.S. , Australia and Eurasia . "" So what PRP 're seeing in DT western [ U.S. ] are whole regions of increased tree death because of NN and drying , "" he VBD . "" PRP are RB seeing a big uptick in insect and NN in forests because these trees are being weakened by DT NN , "" he added ."

DT film followed DT early efforts of a handful of marine biologists who are fighting coral bleaching . PRP grow tiny bits of coral in underwater nurseries and once PRP ’re big enough move them back to DT reef , hoping to restore PRP . Their pace is slow , possibly too slow to keep up with bleaching due to NN NN . NN waters swipe entire reefs in a matter of weeks . DT biologists need months to nurture enough corals to restore a couple of square meters . Reef restoration seems IN an impossible task , but PRP are relentless . PRP must be done to give corals a chance , so PRP are doing PRP . PRP ’s DT same principle guiding young NN activists , atmospheric NNS and NN essayists . As author Rebecca Solnit wrote in 2016 : “ PRP do n’t VB what is VBG to happen , or how , or when , and IN very uncertainty is DT space of hope . ” PRP might RB VB : • Why DT NN is running out of sand In DT dark movie theatre , I felt a JJ bond with DT NNS carrying baby corals and DT filmmakers chasing after them . PRP are , indeed , losing this battle . PRP understand IN , I believe , but in a tropical gulf thousands of miles away from where diplomats and politicians decide our carbon policies and international accords , a group of stubborn biologists and documentarists were refusing to give up . PRP were earning their own hope , CD coral at a NN . I VBP of these dogged coral reef NNS whenever I ’m asked , “ What gives PRP hope ? ” in DT context of NN NN . PRP ’s a question full of nuance . Weighing PRP up , PRP have to consider DT slew of recent record - breaking heatwaves , but RB DT indomitable force of schoolchildren protesting for their futures . PRP acknowledges our dire situation , yet suggests EX might be a way forward . As NN NN awareness goes mainstream – along with DT feelings of anxiousness , pain and grief WDT come with PRP – this question has quickly become code for : “ Where can I find hope ? ”"

From England to Jamaica to DT NNP NNPS , PRP are hearing from artists and activists around DT NN about what PRP can do locally , globally , and everything in between . If EX ’s CD environmental - advocacy organization WDT needs no introduction , PRP ’s Greenpeace . DT NGO has been around for much longer than “ NN NN ” has been a commonplace phrase , lobbying heads of NNS and congresses around DT NN , and protesting for environmental causes on DT open seas , since 1971 . Its actions have received DT scorn of DT fossil - fuel industry , DT nuclear industry , DT whaling industry , JJ other industries , and those industries ’ NN allies . ( DT French NN even admitted IN its external intelligence agency , DT General Directorate for External Security , used explosives to sink DT Greenpeace vessel Rainbow Warrior in DT Port of Aukland in 1985 . ) Annie Leonard is DT executive director of Greenpeace USA ( DT organization has 55 offices worldwide ) . NN NN is a major focus of her advocacy . “ What am I personally doing about NN NN ? A lot of things , I ’ll tell PRP . On an individual level , and RB on a broader society - wide level , because DT ’s where PRP really see DT impacts , ” says Leonard . “ CD of DT things I ’m doing is really investing in community , ” says Leonard . She explains by fostering a strong sense of community with your immediate neighbors , PRP can better fight NN NN . PRP share things to reduce their carbon footprints , for example , by borrowing ingredients from neighbors when baking a cake , instead of driving to DT store for DT CD egg needed . Having a strong community “ RB helps build support and meaning and DT resilience and security WDT PRP ’re VBG to need to VB through DT NN crisis together , just IN PRP ’re seeing strong communities right now helping NNS VB through DT NNP crisis . ” Leonard RB argues PRP ’s important to focus on solutions , not just problems , to maintain a positive and achievable outlook on NN NN . She explains , “ NNS tell PRP , ‘ Oh , DT ’s idealistic , PRP ’re asking for unicorns . ’ If PRP ’ve seen solutions in action , PRP VBP DT is not true . So PRP helps to make our commitment unshakeable . ” On a personal level , Leonard likes to grow her own vegetables , ride a bicycle , and rarely use disposable plastics , but maintains IN “ those are n’t VBG to scale at DT level PRP need to drive broad , broad NN . … Those are a great place to start , but a terrible place to stop . ” So where do PRP stop ? “ DT single most important thing WDT PRP all have to do is stop burning fossil - fuels , ” including oil , coal , and gas , which Leonard points to as DT leading culprit for NN NN . She RB advocates for diverting JJ subsidies away from these industries , and to renewable NN ( while taking care of communities and workers with a “ just transition ” ) . When PRP comes to fossil fuels : “ No JJ permits , no JJ ports , no JJ pipelines . ” Leonard says DT most important thing for individuals is to take action : “ Find an organization or campaign WDT feels IN a good fit for PRP . EX ’s so JJ to choose from . And contact them and ask how PRP can help . If PRP VBP to join Greenpeace , PRP ’d love to have PRP involved . ”"

Marvin Herndon is an American interdisciplinary scientist , who earned his BA degree in physics in 1970 from DT University of California , San Diego and his Ph.D. degree in nuclear chemistry in 1974 from Texas A&M University . For three NNS , J. Marvin Herndon was a post - doctoral assistant to Hans Suess and Harold C. Urey in geochemistry and cosmochemistry at DT University of California , San Diego . He is DT NNP of Transdyne Corporation in San Diego , California . He has been profiled in Current Biography , and dubbed a “ maverick geophysicist ” by DT Washington Post . He suggested IN DT composition of DT inner core of NNP is nickel silicide . DT conventional view is IN PRP is an iron–nickel alloy . More recently , he has suggested "" georeactor "" planetocentric nuclear fission reactors as NN sources for DT gas giant outer planets as DT NN source and production mechanism for DT geomagnetic field and stellar ignition by nuclear fission .

An Open Letter to Members of AGU , EGU , and IPCC Alleging Promotion of Fake NNP at DT Expense of Human and Environmental NNP and Comments on AGU Draft Geoengineering Position Statement In september 2017 , Dr. J Marvin Herndon published a critical expose of DT AGU , EGU , and IPCC alleging DT promotion of falsified NN to promote certain globalist causes . This paper can be founin its entirety at this location : An Open Letter to Members of AGU , EGU , and IPCC Alleging Promotion of Fake NNP Evidence of Variable NN - heat Production , JJ Non-anthropogenic NN NN , and Geoengineered JJ NN and Polar Melting DT publication has been announced in PR Newswire . PRP can view DT paper RB or use DT link at DT bottom of this section : Quote From DT Announcement Either directly or indirectly , Dr. Herndon is exposing DT propaganda WDT is being spread by governments claiming IN jet trails are "" contrails "" . NNP Skywatch has been actively working to open DT NN 's eyes to this very harmful aerosol injection for NNS . In DT announcement , Dr. Herndon says : NN models evaluated by DT IPCC are based on DT assumptions WDT : ( 1 ) Heat derived from DT Sun is constant ; ( 2 ) Heat derived from within DT NNP is constant ; and , ( 3 ) Anthropogenic contributions to atmospheric NN stem mainly from heat retention by CO2 and other greenhouse gases . Geophysical evidence of variable earthquake activity and geological evidence of variable submarine volcanism presented here indicate IN heat added to DT oceans is variable . DT increasing occurrences of earthquakes of magnitudes ≥ 6 and ≥ 7 during 1973 - 2015 indicate volcanic activity is increasing and therefore NNP - heat , as well as volcanic CO2 additions , is increasing . Moreover , increased heat additions to DT ocean act to decrease seawater solubility of CO2 , ultimately releasing additional CO2 to DT atmosphere . Furthermore , increasing submarine volcanic activity implies increasing ocean acidification , but data are insufficient to make quantitative estimates . DT validity of IPCC evaluations and assessments depends critically upon due consideration being given to all processes WDT potentially affect NNP ’s heat balance . In addition to DT geological and geophysical processes discussed , DT scientific community , including IPCC NNS , has turned a blind eye to ongoing tropospheric geoengineering WDT in recent NNS has been occurring on a near - daily , near - JJ basis . Tropospheric aerosolized particulates , evidenced as coal fly ash , inhibit rainfall , heat DT atmosphere , and cause JJ NN . Evidence obtained from an accidental air - drop release indicates efforts to melt glacial NN and enhance JJ NN . By ignoring ongoing tropospheric geoengineering , IPCC assessments are compromised , as is DT moral authority of DT NNP Nations . Evidence of Coal Fly Ash Toxic Chemical Geoengineering on DT Troposphere : Consequences for NNP NNP In this video , Dr. J Marvin Herndon exposes DT evidence demonstrating IN toxic substances are being sprayed into DT atmosphere , and IN at least some of these substances match DT chemical footprint for toxic coal fly ash , which is known to contain heavy metals such as mercury , aluminum , lead , arsenic , cadmium , selenium , thallium , boron , antimony , barium , strontium , vanadium , beryllium , chromium , and cobalt . Paper : Obtaining Evidence of Coal Fly Ash Content in Weather Modification ( Geoengineering ) Through Analysis of Post - Aerosol - Spraying Rainwater and Solid Substances In January 2015 , Dr. Herndon wrote a letter to DT San Diego city council expressing his concern about chemtrails . This letter has been reprinted below . January 16 , 2015 To : Mayor Kevin L. Faulconer , and San Diego City Council Members From : J. Marvin Herndon , Ph.D . Subject : Pervasive Toxic Aerosol Spraying of San Diego Residents I am a scientist ( PhD in nuclear chemistry , Post - Doctoral in Geochemistry and Cosmochemistry ) and businessman , and have lived in Scripps Ranch for thirty seven NNS . Over DT past NN DT skies above San Diego have changed drastically in plain sight . PRP ’ve been robbed of DT beautiful blue skies PRP associate with our city . Almost every day jet airliners are spraying innumerable so - called “ chemtrails ” and PRP persist after release behind DT jets to gradually form clouds . Chemical clouds . Toxic clouds . PRP eventually diffuse and form a white haze in DT sky . Sometimes , DT artificial clouds are laid so thickly as to make DT otherwise blue San Diego sky fully overcast with toxic chemical aerosols . Sometimes , depending on chemical mix , DT transition from spray to white haze is rapid . Please see a few examples , attached , IN I photographed from my front yard . Chemicals sprayed into DT atmosphere do not remain suspended ; PRP fall to contaminate DT air PRP breathe , our rainwater , and our agricultural soil . This ongoing massive spraying taking place over San Diego represents a grave threat to me and my family , my neighbors , and all my fellow San Diegans . Rainwater collected after intensive aerosol spraying now reportedly contains elevated levels of aluminum , barium , and strontium and likely other toxins . Aluminum is implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer ’s , Parkinson ’s , and NN , whose rising incidence is causing alarm to JJ Americans . How JJ additional NNS will be doomed to suffer a lifetime of NN ? How JJ additional San Diegans will suffer premature brain degeneration or cancer ? What horrors lie in store for our NNS and grandchildren who unknowingly play outdoors , or DT pregnant women with their unborn offspring , or DT runners and other outdoor recreationists ? What about those of PRP who suffer asthma or who have compromised immune systems ? What about DT elderly ? What about your own family ? Are PRP San Diegans no longer free to breathe uncontaminated air ? Why are San Diego ’s Mayor and members of San Diego City Council silent about this imminent JJ NN threat ? Were PRP duped into believing IN toxic chemical clouds will keep NNP from VBG ? Clouds might reflect sunlight back into space but those same artificial clouds RB keep NNP from cooling by not letting NNP ’s heat escape during DT night . Clouds , artificial or natural , trap heat ! Why DT silence ? Are PRP afraid EX will be demonstrations or riots in DT streets if DT truth were told about DT ongoing activity WDT poisons DT air San Diegans are now breathing ? Deception by acquiescence and silence is fundamentally wrong , unless PRP are a willing participant in activities WDT will likely come to be characterized as crimes against humanity . As elected officials PRP have DT responsibility to advise and protect all San Diegans . Please speak DT truth and stop this spraying over our homes . DT following links provide information PRP MD find of benefit .

And while small amounts of DT green snow have been visible for NNS , PRP 's starting to spread across DT continent because of NN NN . According to a NN published Wednesday in DT journal Nature Communications , DT vibrant color is caused by microscopic algae blooming across DT surface of DT snow . Using satellite data and fieldwork observations , a team of researchers at DT University of Cambridge and DT British Antarctic Survey have created DT first large - scale map of DT green algae and predicted DT future spread of DT bizarre snow . Green snow appears along DT Antarctic coast , growing in "" warmer "" areas , where DT average temperatures reach just above freezing in DT summer . Although DT individual algae are microscopic , when PRP grow at scale , DT green snow can even be seen from space . For DT NN , DT team combined on - DT - ground research from two summers in DT Antarctic Peninsula with images from DT European Space Agency 's Sentinel 2 satellite taken between 2017 and 2019 . In total , DT team identified over 1,600 separate algal blooms on DT snow surface . DT team found IN DT distribution of green snow algae is strongly influenced by marine birds and mammals , because their excrement works extremely well as fertilizer . Over 60 % of blooms were found near penguin colonies , and others were found near birds ' nesting sites . "" This is a significant advance in our understanding of land - based life on Antarctica , and how PRP might VB in DT coming NNS as DT NN warms , "" lead author Dr. Matt Davey of DT University of Cambridge VBD in a press release . If bird populations are strongly affected by NN NN , as PRP likely will be , DT algae MD lose key sources of nutrients . But DT results of DT NN indicate IN green snow will massively spread as JJ temperatures rise . DT 's because in order to flourish , DT organisms need an available supply of NN . Temperatures on DT peninsula where DT green snow is found have risen dramatically in recent decades , increasing DT amount of NN available . As DT NN warms and more of Antarctica 's snow melts , DT algae will spread , DT NNS VBD . And while some algae will be lost to areas WDT lose snow altogether , much more will be gained . "" As Antarctica warms , PRP predict DT overall mass of snow algae will increase , as DT spread to higher ground will significantly outweigh DT loss of small island patches of algae , "" VBD co-lead author Dr. Andrew Gray , of DT University of Cambridge and DT University of Edinburgh . PRP 's unclear how DT spreading algae will affect DT NN . PRP plays a key role in cycling nutrients and pulling carbon dioxide from DT atmosphere through photosynthesis , Davey VBD , but RB darkens snow , and absorbs more heat from DT sun . DT amount of algae found by DT team creates a carbon sink WDT absorbs about 500 tons of carbon each NN , DT equivalent of about 875,000 average car journeys in DT U.K. , researchers VBD . DT amount of algae found is actually a conservative estimate , because DT satellite was only capable of picking up green algae , missing its red and orange counterparts . "" DT snow is multi-colored in places , with a palette of reds , oranges and greens — PRP 's quite an amazing sight , "" Davey VBD ."

But DT urgency around DT issue reached JJ heights in 2018 when DT NNP Nations ' Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) stated IN rapid , "" far - reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society "" MD be needed in order to drop carbon dioxide levels by 2030 and prevent catastrophic JJ NN . NNS have indeed proposed drastic measures — just not in DT way WDT PRP might VB . In DT same IPCC report , DT U.N. suggests IN adding 2.5 billion acres ( 1 billion hectares ) of forest to DT NN MD limit JJ NN to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ( 1.5 degrees Celsius ) by 2050 . In other words : Responding to NN NN will require planting JJ trees . A lot of them . And now , DT U.N. might just have DT data to back up their proposal . In a recent NN , unveiled July 5 , 2019 in DT journal NNP , a group of researchers associated with DT Crowther Lab in Switzerland found IN JJ tree restoration to DT tune of 223 million acres ( 900 million hectares ) of canopy cover — an area WDT 's approximately DT size of DT U.S. — is "" our most effective NN NN solution to date . "" These trees MD store 205 billion tons ( 186 metric tons ) of carbon , or roughly two thirds of DT carbon WDT has been emitted "" as a result of human activity since DT Industrial Revolution , "" according to a press release . Although some NN reports have VBN this much forest restoration is DT equivalent of roughly 1 trillion trees , this statistic is actually linked to an estimate from an older 2015 NN . Jean - François Bastin , DT Crowther Lab 's NN lead author , breaks down their 2019 analysis by email . "" DT idea was to estimate what tree cover MD be expected when PRP removed DT ' human factor , ' i.e. what specific types of forest MD naturally occur in DT absence of other development , and where , "" he says . Bastin and his team used a form of artificial intelligence known as "" machine learning "" to build "" a model to link tree cover with NN / soil / topography , based on 78,000 observations of tree cover in protected areas . "" DT researchers then projected DT data further to estimate DT "" total potential tree cover of DT NN , "" Bastin explains . Afterward , DT team excluded land currently being used for urban settlements , croplands and existing forests , which yielded DT total amount of land available for restoration . DT NN includes a map showing how much tree coverage different parts of DT globe can support ; DT top three areas include Russia , Canada and DT U.S . In JJ ways , DT NN 's timing MD n't be more perfect , as PRP aligns with current JJ efforts around ecological restoration . CD example is DT Trillion Trees Vision , which seeks to restore 1 trillion trees by 2050 . Another is DT Bonn Challenge , which is a partnership between DT NN of Germany and DT U.N. 's International Union for Conservation of Nature WDT aims to restore 371 million acres ( 150 million hectares ) of deforested land by 2020 . PRP might be thinking , well , DT sounds pretty easy . Let 's all roll up our sleeves and save DT NN by planting CD tree at a NN — right ? But some experts say DT situation is actually a little more complicated than DT rosy picture . Especially if most nations do n't chip in to help . "" Implementation of forest restoration on DT scale discussed in this paper is not as straightforward as PRP might seem , "" says Jim Hallett , chair of DT board of directors for DT Society for Ecological Restoration . "" By 2018 , EX were commitments of over 420 million acres ( 170 million hectares ) by 58 nations , which exceeds DT Bonn Challenge goal . Current estimates indicate IN around 29 percent of DT committed lands are now under restoration , but most of this work has been done by a few NNS . "" Hallett cites major challenges to implementing restoration on such a JJ scale , "" including financing , governance , land tenure and ownership , [ and ] capacity to do DT work . "" Hallett concludes , "" EX is ample evidence IN , in some contexts , if DT benefits of restoration are not equally shared , DT project will fail . So incentive programs have to be carefully developed . "" Although Hallett agrees IN forest restoration is important to addressing NN NN , restoration alone will likely not be enough . PRP takes NN , after all , to implement such big restoration projects and RB for these trees to store carbon . And Hallett stresses IN "" DT possibility of future restoration should not be used as an excuse for degrading intact lands . "" Other NNS question not only DT practicality of DT NN 's claims , but RB DT NN 's very methodology . "" JJ of DT allegedly available restoration areas are clearly unsuitable for more trees than PRP currently support . If PRP look closely at DT map , a large proportion of these areas are in regions where soils are permanently frozen , "" says Eike Luedeling , a NN NN researcher and professor of horticultural sciences at DT University of Bonn . Luedeling continues , "" DT methodology implicitly ( probably not on purpose ) implies IN carbon stock is proportional to canopy cover , i.e. ecosystems without trees contain no carbon . This is clearly false and strongly inflates DT JJ estimate [ of restoration ] . "" Jan Börner , Luedeling 's colleague and a professor for economics of sustainable land use at DT University of Bonn , is similarly skeptical . Börner says IN some areas being proposed for restoration under DT current NN are already in use for other purposes . Börner considers DT NN to be an "" interesting academic exercise ... but as a [ NN NN ] mitigation strategy proposal ( and PRP is being advertised as such ! ) , PRP sends a misleading signal to DT international NN policy debate . "" But do n't fret just yet . Both Bastin and Hallett emphasize IN DT U.N. has declared 2021 to 2030 DT "" Decade on Ecosystem Restoration , "" which MD spur nations to act quickly — and some NNS are already tackling DT initiative head on . And , according to Hallett , forest restoration boasts far more perks than just impacting NN NN , including maintaining — or even increasing — biodiversity and preserving DT ecosystem WDT PRP humans rely upon for our food and NN . But even DT NN 's authors acknowledge IN PRP 's VBG to take a lot of goodwill to make this grand vision a reality . "" What PRP need is universal action : international agencies , NGOs , governments , all citizens — anyone can be involved , "" says Bastian . "" Local communities and small organizations MD be especially effective . While PRP do not have DT same reach as national agencies , PRP have DT benefit of knowing what works best in their own backyards . "" This story is part of Covering NNP Now , a JJ collaboration of more than 250 NN outlets to strengthen coverage of DT NN story ."

ISBN_NNP ._.","Scenario in which human civilization experiences catastrophic events due to NN NN A NN apocalypse ( RB called a NN dystopia and a NN - induced collapse , among other names ) is a hypothetical scenario involving DT JJ collapse of human civilization and potential human extinction as either a direct or indirect result of anthropogenic NN NN and ecological breakdown . Under a JJ catastrophe of this scale , some or all of DT NNP MD be rendered uninhabitable as a result of extreme temperatures , severe weather events , an inability to grow crops , and an altered composition of DT NNP 's atmosphere . [ 1 ] Although EX is consensus on DT attribution of recent NN NN to human activity , [ 2 ] and concern about future tipping points and feedback loops , EX is no consensus on DT likelihood of NN - induced collapse .[ citation needed ] Rhetoric and belief centered on apocalypticism has deep roots in religious contexts , and similar rhetorical approaches undergird secular apocalyptic interpretations of NN . [ 3 ] Historical interpretations fall into two visions of apocalypse : DT tragic and DT comic . Tragic apocalypticism frames a clearly divided good and evil , with preordained events . In contrast , comic framing emphasizes flawed human agency , and PRP tends to be characterized by an open - ended , episodic , and ongoing timeline . [ 4 ] Some of DT most significant books in environmentalism make use of either DT tragic or comic apocalyptic framing : Carson 's Silent Spring ( 1962 ) , Ehrlich 's DT Population Bomb ( 1972 ) , and Al Gore 's NNP in DT Balance ( 1992 ) . [ 5 ] EX is no single agreed term used to describe an environmental and ecological collapse as either a direct or indirect result of anthropogenic NN NN , however such an event has been explored in both fiction and non-fiction for JJ NNS . Jules Verne 's 1889 novel DT Purchase of DT North Pole imagines NN NN due to a deliberate tilting of NNP 's axis . Since NNP War II , EX has been continual discussion of environmental destruction due to nuclear war . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] EX is a Western NN tradition of describing a NN apocalypse with images and descriptions of DT Four Horsemen of DT Apocalypse and other features of DT apocalypse of DT Christian faith . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] JJ NN reduces DT capacity of DT oceans to absorb oxygen . Biomarkers and geologic evidence suggests IN oxygen - deprived oceans resulting from high carbon dioxide concentrations MD have contributed to DT five previous mass extinction events in NNP 's history . Geoscientists have found IN anaerobic microbes MD have thrived in these conditions and produced vast amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas . Hydrogen sulfide is toxic , and its lethality increases with temperature . At a critical threshold , this toxic gas MD have been released into DT atmosphere , causing plant and animal extinctions both in DT ocean and on land . Models suggest IN this MD RB have damaged DT ozone layer , exposing life on NNP to harmful levels of UV radiation . Deformities found in fossil spores in Greenland provides evidence IN this MD have occurred during DT Permian extinction event . At DT end of DT Paleocene and Triassic eras , mass extinctions occurred at carbon dioxide concentrations of around 1,000 ppm . If these concentrations were reached again in DT future , either as a result of anthropogenic or naturally occurring greenhouse gas NNS , PRP is possible IN such an event MD be repeated . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Rising temperatures increase DT risk of an epidemic or pandemic . As DT NN changes , distributors of infectious diseases such as mosquitoes and ticks spread to JJ areas and transmit illnesses to regions which MD not have experienced them otherwise . Epidemics are RB made more likely after severe weather events , such as heavy rainfall or flooding . Food scarcity MD lead some communities to a more meat - based diet , which raises DT risk of outbreaks of diseases such as ebola . Melting permafrost RB threatens to release diseases WDT have been dormant for JJ NNS , as was DT case in August 2016 when a thawed reindeer carcass WDT was almost a century old infected several individuals in Siberia with anthrax . [ 15 ] JJ plants have a maximum temperature at which PRP can grow , and NN NN MD mean IN JJ pests are introduced to areas where PRP was too cold for them to survive before . Extreme weather events and more frequent droughts will RB affect crop production as DT NNP approaches and surpasses 2 °C ( 3.6 °F ) above pre-industrial levels . [ 16 ] A JJ decline in food availability MD lead to severe impacts on JJ NN . If DT NNP 's temperature increases to 2 °C above pre-industrial levels by 2050 , some models predict IN JJ food availability MD be 3.2 percent lower than if no NN NN occurred , resulting in an additional 529,000 deaths worldwide . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] DT combination of heat and humidity can impair DT human body 's ability to cool itself , leading to hyperthermia , a potentially life - threatening condition . A 2017 review considered research over past decades and predicted IN under DT high - end RCP 8.5 scenario given in DT 2014 IPCC Fifth Assessment Report ( which predicts a 3.2°C - 5.4 °C ( 5.76-9.72 °F ) increase in JJ average temperatures by DT end of DT century compared to pre-industrial levels ) , by 2100 , around 73.9 % of DT human population MD live in environments of lethal heat illness for routine human life , compared with around 30.6 % in 2000 . [ CD ] [ failed verification ] As regions become too hot to inhabit or grow crops , as NN becomes more scarce , as NN levels rise and as extreme weather events grow more frequent and more severe , PRP is likely IN more NNS will be displaced from their homes , which MD result in social instability and conflict when these NNS move to JJ areas . [ 1 ] According to DT 2019 NNP Report on Internal Displacement by DT Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre , 61 % of all JJ internal displacement in 2018 was caused by natural disasters , totalling 17.2 million NNS . [ 20 ] Some predict IN as DT number of migrants from poorer nations increases , wealthier nations will impose higher restrictions on immigration and governments will become increasingly authoritarian and populist . Some areas , such as Europe , are more vulnerable to DT stresses of increased migration as a result of their geographical location as well as diplomatic relations with bordering nations . [ 21 ] DT NNP is currently undergoing its sixth mass extinction event as a result of human activity . During DT Permian–Triassic extinction event 250 million NNS ago , DT NNP was approximately 6 °C higher than DT pre-industrial baseline . At this NN , 95 % of living species were wiped out and NN life suffocated due to a lack of oxygen in DT ocean . [ 1 ] During DT previous mass extinction around 66 million NNS ago , an asteroid or comet is predicted to have collided with DT NNP , drastically altering DT NN 's NN and wiping out DT dinosaurs as well as around 75 % of all plant and animal species on DT NN . [ 22 ] NN NN increases DT frequency and intensity of extreme weather events including droughts , storms and flooding . Although PRP is not possible to determine whether or not a specific natural disaster occurred because of NN NN , PRP is possible to VB how much more likely a natural disaster was as a result of NN NN . [ 23 ] As temperatures increase , glaciers and NN sheets melt and DT ocean expands which causes a rise in NN levels . NN levels have risen by about 23 cm since 1880 and are currently rising at around 3.2 mm each NN . [ 24 ] PRP is difficult to predict amounts of NN - level rise over DT next century , although DT NN sheets are melting earlier than predicted which makes a high - end scenario of 2 metres of NN - level rise by 2100 increasingly plausible . [ 25 ] If DT entire Greenland NN sheet were to melt , DT NN 's oceans MD rise by more than 6 metres . [ 26 ] In DT past , at times when DT NNP has been 6 °C above DT pre-industrial baseline , NN levels were 20 metres higher than today . [ 1] If all DT NN on land and at DT poles melted , NN levels MD rise by more than 65 metres . [ 26 ] Rising NN levels result in forced migration and threaten services IN DT Internet , since much of DT Internet 's key infrastructure is built near coastlines and is not built to be permanently submerged in NN . [ 27 ] Abrupt NN changes have occurred in DT past , most clearly recorded in NN records from glacial NN on Greenland . EX have been several explanations put forward for these changes , but DT prevailing paradigm is IN these changes were a result of changes in ocean currents , specifically DT northward transport of heat by DT Atlantic meridional overturning circulation ( AMOC ) . CD example of this is DT Younger Dryas , in which a rapid decline in temperature , recorded in Greenland as a drop of 4 to 10 °C ( 7.2 to 18 °F ) over just a few decades , is thought to have been caused by DT melting of DT Laurentide NNP Sheet providing extra freshwater to DT North Atlantic and interrupting DT AMOC . [ 28 ] PRP is believed IN recent NN NN has caused a 15 - 20 % slowing of DT Gulf Stream , a current which transports warm NN from DT Gulf of Mexico towards north - west Europe , due to a melting of DT Greenland NNP Sheet resulting in large amounts of freshwater pouring into DT North Atlantic . [ 29 ] Although PRP is likely to continue to slow , PRP is unproven whether DT Gulf Stream MD come to a complete halt this century , if ever . However if PRP does , this MD have profound impacts upon large parts of DT NNP 's NN . In DT UK , for example , temperatures MD drop by an average of 3.4 °C ( 6.1 °F ) and more so in Scotland . Rainfall during DT growing season MD RB drop by 123 mm . This MD reduce DT UK's arable land from 32 percent to just 7 percent and PRP is uncertain if EX MD be enough NN to offset this through irrigation , resulting in food shortages . [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Research has shown IN aside from worsening income inequality and DT strain of an increased population exceeding DT carrying capacity of an environment , another important factor which MD lead to JJ collapse is ecological strain . NN NN increases DT strain on DT NN 's ecology , especially in terms of resource depletion . [ 32 ] NN NN has contributed to DT collapse of civilisations in DT past . A 200 - NN drought caused cities of DT Indus Valley Civilisation to be abandoned ; DT Khmer Empire collapsed as a result of successive droughts and monsoon floods which led to political and social unrest ; and a period of cooling called DT Little NNP Age made PRP more difficult for Vikings to farm in Greenland , which was CD of DT reasons IN PRP were forced to abandon their settlements . [ 26 ] More recently , a severe drought in DT late 2000s which is likely to have been intensified by anthropogenic NN NN contributed to failing agricultural production in Syria , leading to high unemployment , large amounts of internal displacement , heightened ethnic tensions and increased violence . Poor governance and neoliberal JJ policies RB contributed to DT resulting civil war and societal collapse in 2011 . [ 32 ] Although DT entire NN is affected by NN NN , DT worst impacts will be felt by DT NN 's poorest NNS , and these NNS are both more likely to face DT effects of societal collapse and more likely to face such effects sooner . This is CD of DT moral issues described within DT NN justice movement of NN NN activism . [ 32 ] As societal collapse becomes more likely , PRP is possible IN denial and anti-intellectualism will increase as well , or IN NNS will assign blame for DT crisis on communities other than their own . As localised violence increases , societal collapse RB becomes more likely . [ 32 ] DT risk of JJ conflict , especially in more vulnerable regions , rises with JJ NN . Studies have shown IN extreme weather events can damage economies , lower food production and raise inequality , which can increase risks of violence when combined with other factors . CD NN found IN NN NN has influenced between 3 % and 20 % of armed conflict in DT last century , IN an increase of 2 °C above pre-industrial levels more than doubles DT current risk of conflict , increasing PRP to 13 % , and IN an increase of 4 °C multiplies DT risk by five , up to a 26 % risk . [ 33 ] A report by DT NNP Peace Index found IN 971 million NNS lived in areas with either a high or very high NN NN exposure and IN 400 million of those NNS lived in NNS with low levels of peacefulness . PRP warned IN NN NN can increase DT likelihood of violent conflict by impacting upon resource availability , job security , and by causing forced migration . [ 34 ] [ 35 ] NNS struggle to reach a consensus on DT likelihood of war as a result of NN NN as future NN NN is likely to be very different from what humanity has experienced previously and DT ability of societies to adapt is unclear . [ 33 ] [ 36 ] Large - scale changes to DT NNP system such as tipping points and possible abrupt NN NN are usually not included in NN models and impact assessments . [ 37 ] This means IN JJ scientific reports , including DT IPCC Assessment Reports , have often underestimated DT impacts of NN NN effects . [ 38 ] NN NNS MD RB downplay potentially disastrous scenarios in favor of more restrained predictions WDT are less likely to be rejected as alarmist or fatalist . [ 38 ] Discussions of ' tail - end ' risks of temperatures rising beyond 3 °C ( 5.4 °F ) are RB often neglected in research more generally . [ 39 ] Current levels of JJ NN are often calculated in terms of DT JJ average increase in DT NNP 's temperature compared with levels prior to DT Industrial Revolution . In 2016 , DT NNP is likely to have reached 1.1 °C ( 1.98 °F ) above pre-industrial levels . [ 40 ] DT rate of JJ NN is influenced by DT amount of greenhouse gases released into DT atmosphere , which has so far led to a linear increase in JJ NN . However JJ NN is non-linear , and is subject to acceleration when certain tipping points are crossed in DT NNP 's NN system , or as atmospheric pollution disappears from DT atmosphere . These MD RB lead to abrupt NN NN . As of December 2019 , current JJ NN policies MD take DT NN to between 2.3 °C and 4.1 °C ( 4.14 -7.38 °F ) above pre-industrial levels by 2100 , while current pledges and targets MD take DT NN to between 2.3 °C and 3.5 °C ( 4.14-6.3 °F ) . [ 41 ] If all of DT fossil fuels on NNP were burned , lower - end estimates calculate IN 5 trillion tonnes of carbon NNS MD be released into DT atmosphere , resulting in a possible 10 °C of NN relative to 1986 - 2005 by DT NN 2300 . [ 42 ] [ 43 ] PRP is more likely IN DT NNP will cross tipping points and / or trigger abrupt NN NN as PRP approaches and surpasses 2 °C above pre-industrial levels . [ 37 ] Some of these tipping points MD lead to accelerated JJ NN and runaway NN NN . In DT event IN NN is limited to 2 °C by 2100 , these carbon cycle feedbacks MD still cause an additional 0.24-0.66 °C ( 0.432-1.188 °F ) of NN by DT NN . These tipping points MD be triggered much earlier , and MD continue to warm DT NN for hundreds or even thousands of NNS . [ 44 ] During DT 1950s and 60s , NNS determined IN DT amount of solar radiation reaching DT NNP had dropped . This was labelled DT JJ dimming effect and has since been proven to have a strong relationship to atmospheric pollution , DT particles of which directly absorb NN from DT sun before reflecting PRP back into space . This has JJ impacts including DT cooling of DT NNP and oceans leading to lower rainfall and more droughts . These pollutants RB lead to DT formation of smog and acid rain and cause various respiratory diseases . JJ dimming MD RB cause heat waves and runaway fires , while DT decrease of sunlight negatively impacts plant growth , endangering animal populations . [ 45 ] As carbon NNS are reduced and DT amount of pollution in DT atmosphere disappears , DT most widely credited studies indicate IN EX will be an increase of about 0.5 °C in JJ average temperature , however some studies have indicated IN up to 1.1 °C is possible . [ 46 ] [ 45 ] Some solutions to this dilemma MD be to use natural geoengineering solutions such as mass rewilding and biochar alongside a reduction of carbon NNS . Other potential solutions MD be much more dangerous and unpredictable , such as artificially injecting additional sulfur dioxide into DT atmosphere . [ 47 ] This MD lead to disproportionately negative impacts on certain regions over others , causing droughts , flooding or desertification . [ 48 ] A paper published in DT journal PNAS in August 2018 entitled "" Trajectories of DT NNP System in DT Anthropocene "" described a threshold which , if crossed , MD trigger multiple tipping points and self - reinforcing feedback loops WDT MD prevent stabilization of DT NN , causing much greater NN and NN - level rises and leading to severe disruption to ecosystems , society , and economies . PRP described this as DT "" Hothouse NNP "" scenario and proposed a threshold of around 2 °C above pre-industrial levels , arguing IN decisions taken over DT next decade MD influence DT NN of DT NN for tens to hundreds of thousands of NNS and potentially even lead to conditions which are inhospitable to current human societies . DT report RB VBZ IN EX is a possibility of a cascade of tipping points being triggered even if DT goal outlined in DT Paris Agreement to limit NN to 1.5- 2.0 °C ( 2.7-3.6 °F ) is achieved . [ 44 ] Even in mid-range scenarios of around 3 °C above pre-industrial levels , extreme weather events , large - scale loss of agricultural land and freshwater sources , and collapsing ecosystems MD lead to widespread suffering and instability and over a billion NNS who currently live in major coastal cities MD need to be relocated due to NN - level rise . CD report published by DT NNP Challenges Foundation wrote IN DT potential destruction of high - end scenarios are beyond their capacity to model , but IN EX is a high likelihood of human civilization coming to an end . DT report VBZ IN PRP are currently in a position where PRP can reduce DT risk of civilization collapse due to NN NN , and possibly avoid PRP . [ 39 ] Although runaway NN NN MD be triggered at 2 °C or even lower , societal collapse in different regions MD not happen until later , although EX is no consensus as to when this MD happen . Some NNS and institutions such as DT NNP Bank have argued IN PRP is uncertain whether adaptation to a 4 °C NN is possible , and IN such an increase in temperature is incompatible with an organised JJ community . [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 49 ] Grist advised IN although some NNS describe an expectation of a horrible NNP Apocalypse , DT effects of NN NN MD be lessened or worsened depending upon when a coordinated response to lessen DT damage develops . [ 50 ] KQED reported IN DT scientific consensus is to take whatever action possible , wherever possible , even when EX are reports of a coming NNP Apocalypse . [ 51 ] NNS commenting in DT Atlantic VBD IN DT Representative Concentration Pathway was an important measurement to watch , and IN as of 2018 this measurement predicts a worst - case scenario for DT NN . [ 52 ] Stratospheric aerosol injection , a hypothetical process for blocking sunlight from DT NN , is proposed as a desperate technological response to reduce existential risk . [ 53 ] What if PRP stopped pretending ? An article written for DT NNP Yorker by Jonathan Franzen in September 2019 argued IN those under DT age of sixty at NN of publishing were likely to see DT radical destabilization of life on NN due to crop failures , fires , crashing economies , flooding , and hundreds of millions of NN refugees , while those under DT age of thirty were almost certain to see PRP . [ 54 ] DT article attracted huge controversy for arguing IN humanity must now accept IN a NN apocalypse is inevitable , and was heavily criticized for being defeatist , as well as for drawing false scientific conclusions IN such a scenario was inevitable , rather than possible . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] A report published in November 2007 by various authors including former director of DT CIA R. James Woolsey Jr. , former national security advisor to Al Gore Leon Fuerth , and former chief of staff for NNP Bill NNP John Podesta entitled "" DT Age of Consequences : DT Foreign Policy and National Security Implications of NNP NNP NNP "" describes both a "" severe "" and a "" catastrophic "" scenario in which JJ NN reaches 1.6 °C ( 2.88 °F ) above pre-industrial levels by 2040 and 5.6 °C ( 10.08 °F ) by 2100 respectively . [ 57 ] In DT "" severe "" scenario , nonlinear NN NN has devastating impacts on society including a possible pandemic ; societal instability due to large increases in migration and food and NN shortages ; threatened identities of JJ communities as a result of rising NN levels and coastal flooding ; likely conflict over resources and possible nuclear war . DT authors write IN in this scenario NN NN causes humanity to undergo a permanent shift in its relationship to nature . [ 57 ] In DT "" catastrophic "" scenario , DT authors write IN human society MD struggle to adapt , and note IN this scenario is so extreme IN its impacts are difficult to imagine . DT authors encourage readers to compare DT scenario to DT threat of terrorism , emphasising IN DT solution to both threats relies on a transformation of DT NN 's NN economy . [ 57 ] In NNP 2019 , Breakthrough - National Centre for NNP Restoration released a report which argued IN NN NN represents an existential threat to human civilisation in DT near to mid-term , calling for a wartime level of response to combat PRP . [ 58 ] DT report featured heavily in DT NN due to DT gravity of its message . [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] DT report described a "" 2050 scenario "" which DT authors define as a way of thinking at DT high - end of DT range of possibilities rather than a scientific projection . Within this scenario , policy - makers fail to act sufficiently and JJ NNS do not peak until 2030 . NN feedbacks are triggered which lead to JJ NN of 1.6°C above pre-industrial levels by 2030 , and 3 °C by 2050 , leading DT NNP into DT "" hothouse NNP "" scenario . NN levels increase by 2 - 3 metres by 2100 , with an eventual 25 metres of NN - level rise locked in . Some regions become unlivable due to DT intense heat and lack of adaptive capacity and around a billion NNS are displaced , while two billion NNS suffer from NN shortages . EX is not enough food to feed DT JJ population and JJ of DT NN 's most populous cities are abandoned due to NN level rise . [ 58 ] In an interview for DT Ecologist , DT Emeritus Director of DT Potsdam Institute for NNP Impact Research Prof . Hans Joachim Schellnhuber warned IN if PRP continue as PRP are now , then over DT next century PRP MD bring civilization to an end . He predicted IN humans MD survive somehow , but IN almost everything which had been built up over DT past two thousand NNS MD be destroyed . He rated chances of success in DT fight against NN NN as more than 5 % but definitely less than 50 % . [ 62 ] In his 2019 BBC documentary NNP NNP – DT Facts , Sir David Attenborough warns IN dramatic action needed to be taken against NN NN within DT next decade to avoid irreversible damage to DT natural NN and DT collapse of human societies . [ 63 ] In a 2019 Channel 4 interview with Jon Snow , Attenborough VBZ IN DT worst outcome of NN NN WDT MD be experienced within DT next seventy NNS MD be civil unrest and mass migration on a great scale . He predicts IN humans will continue to find enough food , but IN their diets will be forced to VB . [ 64 ] Professor Emeritus of NN strategy at DT BI Norwegian Business School Jørgen Randers predicts IN PRP will fail to meet DT pledges of DT Paris Agreement as in DT short - term PRP is cheaper to continue acting as usual . [ 65 ] As a lifelong environmentalist , Prince Charles has given speeches warning IN NN NN MD bring unimaginable horrors and IN PRP calls into question our future survival on DT NN . [ 66 ] Pope Francis has stated IN NN NN threatens DT future of DT human family and IN PRP must take action to protect future generations and DT NN 's poorest who will suffer DT most from humanity 's actions . He has RB stated IN our choice of NN has DT potential to destroy our civilization and IN this must be avoided . [ 67 ] In an interview , DT Secretary - General of DT NNP Nations António Guterres warned IN DT NN was losing DT fight against NN NN , and described lack of action on NN NN as "" suicide "" . [ 68 ] According to Professor Jem Bendell , Deep Adaptation is DT concept purporting IN humanity needs to prepare for fundamental disruption of its current civilisation paradigms , due to NN NN , with a likelihood of complete societal collapse . Unlike NN NN adaptation , which aims to adapt societies gradually to DT effects of NN NN , Deep Adaptation is premised on accepting abrupt transformation of DT environment as a consideration for making decisions today . [ 69 ] In 2019 , Jem Bendell started DT Deep Adaptation Forum . According to DT website , DT Deep Adaptation Forum is an "" international online space to connect NNS , in all spheres of life , to foster mutual support ; collaboration ; and professional development in DT process of facing societal collapse . "" [ 70 ] Bendell RB created a Deep Adaptation Facebook group for discussing these topics . Various academic publications describe how political discourse , DT NN , and scientific studies address DT idea of a potential NN apocalypse . [ 71 ] NNS in various cultures at various times have told stories about NN NN . [ 72 ] Among all cultures and times which tell these stories , patterns in DT stories which repeat include questioning whether humans caused DT NN , DT relationship between short - term local experiences and longer term JJ records , NNS of common cultures producing images of NN NN which align with others in their culture but not with those outside their culture , designating certain classes of institutions IN laboratories as being reliable sources of information , and DT modification of reliable reports to create a more desirable narrative of how DT information ought to lead to a particular community changing their behavior . [ 72 ] Discussion of NN NN is unusual for having attracted unusually diverse participation of communities which strongly present their own view . Those communities include citizens engaged in JJ participation , academic sectors , any non-academic professional sector asserting knowledge , participants in popular culture , advocates for Indigenous peoples , anyone negotiating DT powers of capitalism , those practicing a religion , and anyone responding to JJ opinion . [ 72 ] Sources of information about NN NN tell various categories of stories , including personal experiences , community experiences , scientific models , JJ forecasts , and prophecies of apocalypse . [ 72 ] Some researchers have speculated IN society cannot comprehend an accurate end of DT NN prediction , and instead , more governments MD be willing to respond productively to prevent catastrophe if reports framed DT matter as a smaller problem than PRP actually is . [ 73 ] Talking about potential disaster can have a broad impact upon society by making JJ NNS feel IN if DT situation were truly horrible , then EX must be good plans to prevent PRP so no further action is needed . [ 74 ] As NN apocalypse becomes more real , DT NN presents JJ imagined apocalypse scenarios in a way WDT conflates them all . [ 75 ] Political conversations about NN apocalypse tend to describe how preventing PRP in DT future MD bring zero value for today , therefore DT value of doing something today is zero . [ 76 ] DT lack of response to NN NN despite PRP being an existential risk MD be an indication IN human society lacks an ability to understand a threat of this magnitude without some radical NN in perspective . [ 77 ] Esquire described how since 1990 NN NNS have communicated urgent warnings while simultaneously experiencing DT NN converting their statements into sensational entertainment . [ 78 ] A 2013 report described how incorporating DT concept of preventing catastrophe into JJ policy seems unprecedented and challenging to accomplish . [ 79 ] NN fiction is a popular NN genre which frequently features stories of NN apocalypse . Examples include Ismael , a 1992 philosophical novel , [ 80 ] and Mad Max : Fury Road , a 2015 action film . [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Concern over a NN apocalypse has been DT subject of articles of satirical NN features . CD theme is popular revolt against power brokers . Another is DT desire of youth to have a liveable environment in adulthood . [ 84 ] [ 85 ] Another are fantasies about DT romance and adventure of NNS experiencing DT chaos of ecological and societal collapse . [ 86 ] [ 87 ] • None Stoknes , Per Espen ( September 2017 ) .

DT NNP NN has just pulled DT NN ’s second - largest emitter of greenhouse gases out of DT Paris NN accord . Ms Thunberg demands significantly more than a 50 per cent cut in JJ net NNS by 2030 . DT former is certainly irresponsible . But DT latter seems inconceivable . DT exasperation of radical NN activists is understandable . Despite decades of talk , NNS of greenhouse gases and JJ temperatures continue to rise . If DT trend does not alter soon , DT chances of avoiding an increase in JJ average temperatures of more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will be zero and those of avoiding a 2C increase will be tiny . As DT IMF notes in its latest Fiscal Monitor , meeting DT latter goal requires reducing NNS of greenhouse gases by a third below DT baseline , by 2030 . To keep below a 1.5C increase , NNS need to be half of DT baseline . DT longer DT delay in acting , DT larger DT required action becomes , until nothing can be done because PRP will be too late . PRP is already almost too late to avoid what experts view as destructive and irreversible changes in NN . For DT reason , dramatic policies are needed . Yet PRP are feasible , argues DT NNP Transitions Commission , if PRP are firmly implemented over DT next three decades . Unfortunately , DT outright opposition of NNS such as Mr NNP , and DT indifference of much of DT population , are not DT sole obstacles to success . Even some who favour action are a problem , because DT NN cause is for them part of a wider campaign against DT market . Thus , JJ supporters of DT Green NNP Deal view NN as a justification for DT planned economy . As British journalist Paul Mason argues : “ Labour wants to combat NN NN through three mechanisms : NN spending , NN lending and DT NN direction of private finance . ” This approach allows opponents to argue IN DT left is more concerned with destroying market economies than saving DT NN . DT mess created by trying to plan an economy into zero net NNS in a decade might bring all attempts at mitigation into disrepute . In any case , NN NN will not be solved by CD country . To succeed , policy must be effective , legitimate and JJ . To be effective , policy must combine planning , regulation , research and incentives . EX is strong justification for NN actions in research , spatial planning and finance . But EX is RB a need for incentives aimed at shifting behaviour . Command and control are rarely as effective all on their own . DT IMF report suggests $ 75 a tonne of carbon might be DT price in 2030 consistent with keeping DT temperature increase below 2C . Today , while EX are a host of pricing arrangements , DT prices themselves are mostly far too low and variable over NN and across NNS to be useful . Yet , in principle , a carbon tax , or an NNS trading system with a price floor , is DT most effective ( because most comprehensive ) way to influence NNS . Schemes WDT generate fiscal revenue ought RB to be attractive to politicians , because DT money can be used for other valuable purposes . Taxing a “ bad ” ( a form of pollution , in this case ) always offers an opportunity to improve taxation or raise valuable spending . An important point made by DT IMF report is IN such NNS as NNP and India MD benefit especially from a reduction in local environmental pollution , because of DT benefits of reduced use of coal . PRP is RB vital IN these NNS do see such benefits from use of carbon taxes , because PRP are VBG to have to play a big part in bringing about DT needed reductions in JJ NNS ( relative to DT baseline ) . PRP is in these NNS , too , IN a huge part of DT needed investment in JJ NN systems must be made . So incentives matter greatly . To make policy legitimate , PRP is essential to compensate losers . PRP is not true IN DT poor are always proportionately most adversely affected by higher NN prices . But protests by DT rest of DT population matter , too . Compensation for higher fuel prices needs to be visible . As important , a convincing vision of a better future must be offered . Otherwise , DT necessary changes in policy will never be accepted . Finally , policy has to be JJ , with all DT bigger economies involved . This creates huge problems of equity . Clearly PRP are never VBG to reach a perfect solution . But some solution will have to be found in generous assistance from high - income NNS to emerging and developing NNS , especially with DT introduction of JJ technologies . This RB raises an important question : what is to be done with free - riders and , above all , DT biggest free - rider of all , DT rogue NNP ? DT answer in principle is clear : PRP will have to be penalised quite heavily . If PRP accept , as PRP should , DT urgency of DT challenge , this follows quite naturally . What , then , is to be done ? DT answers include a programme of action over three decades , starting now ; pragmatic resort to all policy tools , including market - based incentives ; use of DT revenue raised from carbon pricing to compensate losers and make DT tax system and NN mitigation more efficient ; a stress on DT local environment benefits of eliminating DT use of fossil fuels ; and , above all , a commitment to NN as a shared JJ challenge . In an era of populism and nationalism , is EX any chance of all this ? Not obviously , alas . If so , PRP will indeed have failed . But DT young are surely right to expect better .

Family - owned Cairns - based company Passions of Paradise have provided a catamaran and fuel . Other businesses involved include Wavelength , Ocean Freedom , Sailaway and Quicksilver Cruises . PRP are working alongside a team from DT University of Technology Sydney led by Dr. David Suggett . DT initiative is called DT Coral Nurture Program . Similar projects in DT area were already in place , such as DT Crown - of - Thorns ( a coral destroying starfish ) eradication and DT Eye on Reef monitoring program . But what makes this latest project unique is IN PRP ’s DT first NN tour companies have worked together with researchers . DT technique being used to restore DT coral – using ‘ coral clips ’ , is RB a first . Lorna Howlett , project coordinator and PhD student , explains how PRP works : “ PRP involves finding fragments of opportunity – coral fragments WDT have naturally broken off , ” she VBD . “ And attaching them back on to DT reef using a coral clip . PRP can only use fragments of opportunity found at DT site , so Passions of Paradise has installed six frames at DT site which can be used as a nursery to grow more corals . ” Approximately 1000 pieces of coral have been planted on Hastings Reef so far . DT Great Barrier Reef is home to an incredibly diverse array of sea-life and was declared a NNP Heritage Area in 1981 . Situated off DT northeast coast of Australia , PRP stretches for around 2300 km . PRP is DT biggest coral reef system in DT NN , comprising around 2900 individual reefs and 900 islands . A 2014 report by DT Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority found IN NN NN and JJ heating is DT biggest threat to DT reef . Polluted land NN quality running into DT NN , coastal development , fishing , ocean acidification and coral bleaching are other major issues . According to a 2012 report , DT Great Barrier Reef has lost half PRP ’s coral since 1985 . In 2015 , DT Reef 2050 Plan came into place . This is a 35 - NN plan for DT long - term management of pollution and NN NN . Anthony McLennan is an experienced journalist who has written for some of South Africa ’s biggest publications . RB a photographer , soccer coach , dog- lover and surfer , enjoys spending NN outdoors in beautiful Cape Town .

As PRP is , 2020 will likely end up as CD of DT hottest NNS in history , with more devastating storms , droughts and floods to come , according to a groundbreaking NN recently released by Nature NNP NNP . “ Population confinement has led to drastic changes in NN use and CO2 NNS , ” DT NN ’s lead author , Professor Corinne Le Quéré of DT University of East Anglia VBD . “ These extreme decreases are likely to be temporary though , as PRP do not reflect structural changes in DT JJ , transport or NN systems . ” “ NNP - CD has been disruptive , costly , and tragic , but EX are some hopeful elements WDT PRP can pull out of this pivotal moment in human history , ” says Howard , an ER doctor in Yellowknife , Canada , who is RB board NN of DT Canadian Association of Physicians for DT Environment and TEDx speaker . Here are five positives to take away from DT pandemic as PRP continue to fight NNP - CD and DT even larger existential threat of NN NN : “ Now IN JJ have mastered Zoom , and have equipped their homes for virtual work , PRP can expect at least some degree of telecommuting to continue as PRP open up and NNS VBP back to school , saving NNS up to several hours a day in commuting NN , ” Howard tells NNPS . “ PRP VBP IN longer driving NN , particularly over a couple of hours per day , is associated with insufficient physical activity , less sleep and worse physical and mental NN , and so this gives PRP back our most precious resource : NN . NN to exercise , NN to cook healthy meals at home , NN to snuggle with our kids , NN to rest . ” “ When pressed , PRP prioritize NN and are capable of changing DT NN quickly , "" says Howard . "" Sometimes in NN - related work , NNS have gotten discouraged by entrenched habits and power structures . MD PRP ever have pictured , at Christmas , IN DT NN MD VB this much , this quickly ? "" “ Now PRP VBP IN , although our responses have n't been perfect , PRP can work together as a JJ community , and create significant NN - based NN on a quick NN - line , "" Howard adds . "" This helps PRP see IN a rapid , effective response to NN NN is possible . ” “ DT reduction in vehicle traffic has cleared DT skies in JJ cities around DT NN , allowing PRP to see how bright and fresh DT NN can feel when PRP reduce fossil fuel use , "" says Howard . "" With outdoor air pollution responsible for 4.2 million deaths a NN around DT globe , according to DT NNP NNP Organization , this shows PRP IN not only can DT NN look wonderful when PRP use less fossil fuels , but IN doing so can save lives immediately , and through decreased NN impacts of NN NN from wildfires , heat - related illness and more , [ PRP can ] continue to improve NN for generations to come . "" “ When PRP work together , PRP can save lives , and by building back better , PRP can save more , "" she says . "" I went to school for NNS to learn how to save lives in DT Emergency Room . By listening to NNS , NNS around DT globe have demonstrated how much PRP care about NN , and CD another , and have saved lives by staying home ! "" “ With DT Lancet - UNICEF - WHO Future Child Report having shown PRP IN NN NN is CD of DT major NN risks for today 's NNS , if PRP extend DT same care for CD another to a commitment to a healthy recovery , PRP have a generational opportunity to channel our JJ stimulus funds into DT acceleration of a transition to a clean NN economy .

In a recent video published by DT “ NNP Education Center ” at DT NNP ’s Hospital of Philadelphia ( CHOP ) where he works , Offit tries to make DT case IN antibody blood tests , which measure antibody levels as an indicator of immunity against NN , are n’t medically useful . If this is DT case , then everything WDT DT Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and Centers for NNP Control and Prevention ( CDC ) rely upon to create NN policy is RB not medically useful , or accurate . Using antibody blood tests to try to measure a protective immune response , in Offit ’s own words , is “ not as easily done as PRP MD VB . ” And yet , DT presence of antibodies in DT blood has long been what NN officials claim is , in fact , a valid indicator IN a person is immune to NN – so which is PRP ? DT answer is neither and both , depending upon what ’s trying to be accomplished . In Offit ’s case , DT goal is to keep as JJ parents as possible on DT NN train , which will ensure IN NN manufacturers VBP himself continue to rake in massive profits . At DT same NN , Offit ’s very argument is invalidated by his own admissions towards this end , as he clearly VBZ in DT video IN antibody titer does not necessarily correlate with immunity . Similarly , a lack of antibodies is not necessarily an indicator of a lack of immunity . Using a measles outbreak WDT occurred during DT late 1980s and early 1990s to try to make his point , Offit VBZ in DT video IN , when looking back on this particular outbreak , PRP was discovered IN “ EX were JJ NNS who had been vaccinated , but who did n’t have antibodies against measles who were still protected . ” In other words , antibody tests are n’t , in fact , a valid indicator of immunity , even though this is what DT NN uses as “ evidence ” WDT NNS somehow work . “ DT reason PRP were still protected is PRP had something called memory cells , ” Offit further explains . “ Memory immunological cells , IN B - and T - cells , which then , when PRP were exposed to DT NN , became activated , differentiated , made antibodies , which then protected them . So even though PRP did n’t have circulating antibodies in their bloodstream , PRP still have these memory cells in their immune system WDT MD then respond when PRP were exposed . So , if PRP looked at those NNS and saw PRP did n’t have antibodies , PRP MD have falsely concluded PRP were n’t protected when PRP were . ” For more NN about DT NN ’s NN fraud , be sure to check out Vaccines.news . Thank PRP , Paul Offit , for once again illustrating why parents should n’t vaccinate their NNS Offit goes on in DT video to admit IN sometimes PRP can have antibodies in your bloodstream “ and not be protected ” – again , his own words . As PRP turns out , PRP appears to be some combination of antibody levels , cell - mediated immunity , and mucosal immunity WDT provides true protection against NN , depending on DT NN , meaning NN NN as PRP ’s currently being propagated by JJ NN officials is wholly inaccurate and unreliable . PRP remains unclear whether or not Offit truly realizes what he ’s confessed to , here , seeing as how DT video in question is still available for viewing on DT CHOP website . Or perhaps Offit is too dense to even realize what he ’s now publicly admitted , which only goes to show how deluded these NN - pushers are when PRP comes to their methods of persuasion . Hilariously , Offit ’s conclusion in DT video is n’t IN DT entirety of NN NN needs to be reevaluated due to these inherent flaws . Instead , he says DT , because “ titers are difficult , ” and “ not a perfect indicator ” of immunity , IN “ DT best way of knowing IN PRP ’re protected is to VB DT NNS WDT are recommended at DT NN PRP are recommended . ” In other words , nothing DT NN lobby has been saying for decades makes an ounce of sense , and DT whole thing is obviously a fraud . But keep on getting your NNS , NNS , because DT ’s DT only way to keep yourself safe and healthy ! CD wonders : Who is actually buying this tripe anymore and subjecting their family to its illogical provisions ? “ Far from providing parents with a convincing argument for why PRP should strictly comply with DT CDC ’s childhood NN schedule , what Paul Offit and DT CHOP have provided PRP with in this video is a strong argument for why DT very process by which NNS obtain licensure by DT FDA is scientifically invalid , ” writes Jeremy R. Hammond , a contributing writer for NNP ’s NNP Defense ( CHD ) . “ Indeed , DT conclusion seems inescapable IN DT FDA ’s use of antibody titers as a surrogate measure of immunity for DT purposes of NN licensure amounts to scientific fraud . ” Be sure to read Hammond ’s full , in - depth analysis of Offit ’s video at NNP ’s NNP Defense ."

DT ship is expected to come out of DT NN east of Greenland in September after gathering a NN ’s worth of data on conditions in DT remote Central Arctic . DT Kapitan Dranitsyn left Tromso , Norway , on Jan. 29 with 43 tons of food , fuel and other supplies for DT Polarstern , as well as a replacement team of researchers and technicians for what is DT third two - month leg of DT expedition . DT resupply trip was expected to take about two weeks , but DT icebreaker ran into trouble from DT start , when a storm in DT Barents NNP forced PRP to anchor off Tromso for DT better part of a week . Once underway , DT ship encountered NN NN WDT had gotten much thicker as DT winter progressed — doubling to more than 5 feet , or 1.5 meters , in places . DT Kapitan Dranitsyn finally arrived at DT Polarstern on Feb. 28 . After several days unloading DT supplies and transferring personnel across about a half - mile of NN in dangerous conditions ( a wind chill of minus 72 degrees Fahrenheit , or about minus 58 Celsius ) , DT Kapitan Dranitsyn left for DT return trip to Tromso . But calculations showed IN PRP MD not have enough diesel fuel for DT journey .

Early this week , DT two ships were about 350 miles , or roughly 560 kilometers , apart .

Do PRP turn DT lights on in DT morning , or is DT light of daybreak sufficient for finding matching socks ? Do PRP feast on bacon and eggs for breakfast , or will a bowl of oatmeal suffice ? EX is a lot of talk these days about DT need to lead lower - carbon lifestyles . EX is RB a lot of finger - pointing VBG on and , some argue , virtue signaling . But who is truly walking DT NN walk ? DT carnivore who does n’t fly ? DT vegan who travels to see family abroad ? If nobody is without carbon sin , who gets to cast DT first lump of coal ? If all NN advocates were expected to live off DT grid , eating only what PRP MD grow themselves and wearing only DT clothes PRP ’d knitted from scratch , EX MD n’t be much of a NN movement . DT level of sacrifice is unacceptable to most . PRP do n’t need to ban cars ; PRP need to electrify them ( and PRP need DT electricity to come from clean NN ) . PRP do n’t need to ban burgers ; PRP need NN - friendly beef . To spur these changes , PRP need to put a price on carbon , to incentivize polluters to invest in these solutions . Though air travel accounts for only a paltry 2 % of JJ NNS , whether or not NN NNS should fly consumes far more than 2 % of my Twitter timeline . Unfortunately , sometimes doing NN means traveling great distances , and PRP do n’t always have DT NN or luxury to take slower low - carbon options . PRP have a job to do , after all . But even still , a single scientist , or even hundreds of NNS , choosing to never fly again is not VBG to VB DT system . Purchasing carbon offsets for flights is a viable means of decarbonizing your air travel , for now . However , DT true solution , pricing carbon , requires policy NN . EX is a long history of industry - funded “ deflection campaigns ” aimed to divert attention from big polluters and place DT burden on individuals . Individual action is important and something PRP should all champion . But appearing to force Americans to give up meat , or travel , or other things central to DT lifestyle PRP ’ve chosen to live is politically dangerous : PRP plays right into DT hands of NN - NN deniers whose strategy tends to be to portray NN champions as freedom - hating totalitarians . DT bigger issue is IN focusing on individual choices around air travel and beef consumption heightens DT risk of losing sight of DT gorilla in DT room : civilization ’s reliance on fossil fuels for NN and transport overall , which accounts for roughly two - thirds of JJ carbon NNS . PRP need systemic changes WDT will reduce everyone ’s carbon footprint , whether or not PRP care . DT good NN is PRP have tactics to bring environmentally friendly ( and non-lifestyle - disrupting ) options to fruition­ : pricing carbon NNS and creating incentives for renewable NN and reduced consumption . By putting a price on carbon , NNS can actually make money by reducing NNS , selling their services to corporations WDT are always looking for ways to cut costs . Never underestimate DT resourcefulness of Americans when EX ’s a dime to be made ! But a price on carbon needs to be designed such IN marginalized communities most at risk from NN impacts are n’t adversely impacted economically as well . This is why PRP really need political NN at every level , from local leaders to federal legislators all DT way up to DT NNP . PRP need NN not just at DT breakfast table , but at DT ballot box as well . This is CD article in a series on DT NN of DT NN ’s response to NN NN . Read DT rest of DT stories and sign up for CD .

I was imagining IN PRP MD be as fast as DT Velvet Revolution WDT began exactly 20 NNS earlier . So JJ NN skeptics were disillusioned by DT speed . Now , 14 months later , things are beginning to move at DT top places . Barack Obama has n’t mentioned any NN , NN , disruption , carbon , or fossil fuels in his key annual talk – even though he was talking for a whole hour . DT Guardian just brought PRP another dose of good NN : DT boss of DT NNP Nations will stop his personal involvement in DT battle to regulate DT NN NN . Instead , he will try to achieve “ immediate gains ” in DT field of clean NN and sustainable development . Even his U.N. colleagues have apparently understood IN EX ca n’t be any “ deal ” . Now , obviously , I have nothing whatsoever against clean or renewable NN sources . My only complaint is against huge subsidies of such things WDT used to be justified ideologically – by DT deluded propaganda about NN disruption . Stock up with Fresh Food WDT lasts with eFoodsDirect ( AD ) If this propaganda really goes away , as Obama and Ki-moon indicate by their shifted attitudes , EX is a hope IN common sense and rational costs - and - benefits analysis will return to DT NN industry and beyond . In DT 2011 NN of DT Union address , Obama RB mentioned oil and biofuels WDT MD replace PRP . DT ’s surprising because even Al Gore has admitted IN their support of biofuels was a big blunder . On DT other hand , I can imagine IN EX will exist biofuels WDT actually make JJ sense . What I find important is IN politicians will no longer promote nonsensical solutions by general slogans WDT are based on bad NN , fearmongering , and intimidation referring to insane planetary emergencies . PRP , DT NN skeptics , have been warning against such irrational attitudes and PRP have been proved right pretty much in all NNS . First - generation biofuels as well as carbon trading has been showed to be a disaster while solar and wind power turned out to be significant JJ problems in JJ NNS such as my homeland . Well , of course , I do n’t believe IN DT politicians will completely stop doing irrational things . But DT amount of this bad policymaking MD simply decrease as DT rats are gradually leaving DT rotten and sinking bandwagon . Let PRP hope IN JJ other politicians will follow in Obama ’s and Ki-moon ’s footsteps . As JJ more NNS regain their common sense and all plans to regulate carbon evaporate , almost everyone will see IN DT NNP is doing just fine and DT NN skeptics have saved trillions of dollars . Will PRP be rewarded or will PRP remain DT silent heroes who have just saved DT civilization without any greed ? ;-) This article was posted : Friday , January 28 , 2011 at 5:37 am"

Case in point : DT trending Twitter hashtag “ Autistics for Greta . ” “ She is my SHERO ! ” user @hmcooperauthor wrote in September . “ Such a fearless , articulate young woman . PRP might be considered ‘ odd , weird , quirky ….’ Or whatever adjectives WDT PRP prefer to insert but I ’m convinced folks on DT NNP Spectrum have superpowers WDT PRP all just do n’t … ” User @ ThruThe PrismArt agreed , writing , “ I ’m on DT spectrum .

This is what ASD is . Passion and unending dedication to a cause , ” user @AmberOckerbloom added . “ @GretaThunberg is a superhero to my daughter and all those on DT spectrum . ASD is why she is who she is . How can DT ever be something bad ? ! ” Regardless of why PRP ’re paying attention to her , Thunberg told NNPS she knows she has JJ eyes watching her every move — and hopes to make DT best of PRP . “ Right now , I have a lot of NNS listening to what I am saying , so I am using DT platform to try to achieve a NN , ” she VBD . DT disorder is characterized by having difficulty with social interactions , restricted interests , a desire for sameness , and distinctive strengths , IN “ remarkable ” focus and persistence , an aptitude for recognizing patterns , and attention to detail , according to NNP Speaks . Those strengths have served Thunberg well , as she explained on CBS This Morning IN her Asperger ’s actually helps her in seeing DT NN through a different lens . “ In some circumstances PRP can definitely be an advantage to have some kind of neurotypical diagnosis , to be neurodiverse , because DT makes PRP different , DT makes PRP VB differently , ” she VBD . “ And especially in such a big crisis IN this , when PRP need to VB outside DT box . PRP need to VB outside our current system , PRP need NNS who VBP outside DT box and who are n’t IN everyone else . ” “ I ’m not JJ about my diagnosis to ‘ hide ’ behind PRP , but because I VBP JJ ignorant NNS still see PRP as an ‘ illness , ’ or something negative , ” she wrote . “ I VBP she ’s a role model to everyone , ” Remi told NBC NNP . “ But I VBP for somebody who has Asperger ’s or is on DT NN spectrum , her ability to be honest and disclose PRP in such an empowering way is what ’s inspirational . Greta is disclosing PRP in a way WDT she ’s proud of . ” “ PRP means a lot WDT she ’s willingly embraced Asperger ’s syndrome and talks about PRP openly . PRP creates a lot of awareness and destroys some stigmas , ” he VBD . “ I VBP PRP MD have had a tremendous impact on what I viewed as possible not only for myself , but for cultivating relationships around me . ” “ I VBP PRP ’s very hopeful , all DT young NNS who are a part of DT NN NN movement , ” she previously told NNP . “ DT keeps me VBG , to see IN PRP actually has made a difference .

But PRP ’s not DT only crisis DT NN is facing , and PRP ought not , while confronting DT immediate menace , disregard DT other immense threat looming over PRP : JJ NN . Rather , somewhat counterintuitively , PRP should use DT current pandemic to learn some lessons and glean some insights about DT other perils PRP will soon be facing . PRP ’re not suggesting IN NN NN contributed to DT NN outbreak ; EX seems to be no direct link , although experts say a VBG NN MD accelerate pandemics of insect - borne diseases ( DT NN is spread person to person ) . But DT JJ response to this pandemic does show IN DT NN can come together to confront a shared threat . DT MD bode well for addressing NN NN — if PRP treat PRP as seriously . DT pandemic is putting a chokehold on JJ activity in hard - hit regions of DT NN — NNP , Europe and here in DT U.S. When factories and businesses are closed , workers and customers stay home ( here in California and in NNP York , by order of DT governors ) . With few NNS traveling long distances , airlines slash flights . Sure , NNS and businesses continue to use NN , but not at DT levels PRP did just a month ago . And DT reduction in NN use in turn reduces fossil fuel consumption and NNS of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into DT atmosphere . Little of this will be long - lasting . Once DT epidemic subsides , JJ activity will resume and so , presumably , will NNS . But DT crisis offers opportunities for NN , and PRP ought to be mindful of them as DT pandemic and DT JJ crisis play out . Businesses are learning how much of their workforce can do their jobs remotely , which offers guidance for how PRP might operate in DT future with a lighter carbon footprint . Consumers are undergoing a forced experiment in changed patterns of shopping and consumption . Congress and NNP NNP RB are negotiating a series of bailouts and other support packages to help NNS and businesses survive . PRP should take this opportunity to press for changes in how some of these industries operate . DT airline industry , for instance , should be asked to do more to reduce its carbon NNS , which have soared in recent NNS and will continue to rise as air travel itself is projected to increase . A September paper from DT International Council on Clean Transportation used industry data to conclude IN commercial air operations account for 2.4 % of JJ carbon NNS from burning fossil fuels , and IN industry NNS in 2018 were 32 % higher than five NNS before . CD available NNS - reducing alternative is DT use of so - called sustainable aviation fuels , including biofuels , but PRP are more expensive than conventional jet fuel . And airline companies can be pressured to adopt aggressive plans to replace older , higher - polluting planes . DT MD be in line with DT demand for increased fuel efficiency commitments WDT DT Obama administration attached to its bailout package for DT auto industry . Of course , extracting NN - friendly concessions will vary by DT industry seeking bailout help , so PRP wo n’t VB too prescriptive here . DT main imperative for DT NN is to keep NN policy in mind as PRP devises a plan to rescue DT economy . But wait , PRP VBP . This is DT NNP administration , which at best shrugs at DT NN and ignores JJ NN . True enough , but Congress RB is involved , and PRP can place NN considerations on DT table . Here ’s a good place to start : DT NN should not be bailing out DT oil and gas industry at a NN when PRP should be focusing on expanding production of renewable NN and DT infrastructure to store and deliver PRP . In recent days , early NN scoffers — including DT NN — have come around to DT reality IN this pandemic is a deadly threat and have finally begun taking strong steps to address PRP . Yet JJ NN is a larger and longer - lasting threat to humankind . PRP have about a decade , according to DT experts , to make significant reductions in carbon NNS to avoid DT worst ramifications of NN NN . DT NN already is seeing DT effects in longer and more severe droughts in some places , record flooding in others , stronger and more intense tropical storms and regional temperature rises WDT are making parts of DT word nearly uninhabitable . DT NN confirms all this , as PRP has confirmed DT spread and dangers from DT novel NN . So maybe accepting DT reality of NNP - CD will lead DT administration to recognize DT reality of NN NN and work with Congress to begin addressing PRP in meaningful ways ."

DT document , published this month on a NN website , VBD NN NN MD have a significant and growing influence on Russia ’s “ socio-economic development , living conditions and human NN , as well as on DT NN of JJ infrastructure ” . Russia MD need to adjust to an increase in droughts , heavy rainfall , flooding , forest fires and infectious diseases , and should start teaching NN NN in schools , PRP VBD . Given DT “ increasing vulnerability ” of DT population and economy to extreme weather and NN impacts , measures to adapt MD be of “ strategic importance ” , including “ making use of ” JJ JJ opportunities , PRP added . DT fossil fuel - rich nation MD reap advantages from higher temperatures and melting NN , including less use of NN for heating , increased access for shipping in DT Arctic and an expansion of agricultural production , PRP noted . But NN NN experts VBD DT JJ framework was too general and did not require authorities to take real steps in DT near term – even as DT effects of NN NN are becoming more apparent . Alexey Kokorin , head of DT NN and NN program at green group WWF - Russia , told DT Thomson Reuters Foundation adaptation to a VBG NN was “ so evidently a necessity ” . DT negative consequences of NN NN were “ already quite strong ” for Russia but PRP had yet to work out how “ to take advantage of DT positive ones ” , he added . Temperatures in Russia have risen 2.5 times faster than DT JJ average since DT mid-1970s , according to DT document . Recent NN - related disasters in Russia have included 2019 wildfires WDT raged across Siberia , destroying at least 3 million hectares ( 7.4 million acres ) of forest . Roman Vilfand , acting head of Russia ’s Hydrometeorology Center , noted this month IN temperatures across DT country were far above normal levels , including 20 C higher than average in Siberia , CD of DT NN ’s coldest places . Moscow ’s authorities were even forced to bring in artificial snow for NNP NNP celebrations during DT Russian capital ’s warmest December since 1886 . And in early January , NN melted on DT Yenisei River in Siberia ’s Krasnoyarsk region , flooding several villages . Russia ’s Ministry of NNP Development told DT Thomson Reuters Foundation DT plan , which PRP produced , MD lay DT foundations for a national strategy to adapt to NN NN , while raising JJ awareness of DT issue . “ PRP will RB emphasize IN DT Russian Federation is ready to make efforts and systematically deal with DT fight against NN NN , ” DT ministry VBD in a written comment . DT document outlines a framework for national adaptation , mainly through legislative amendments and drafting of plans for regions and JJ sectors over DT next three NNS . DT ministry plans to start developing and costing detailed measures only in late 2022 . “ Regions are not really required to do anything over DT next few NNS - PRP is a very unambitious document , ” VBD Georgy Safonov , associate professor at DT Higher School of Economics in Moscow . Until recently Russia had no coordinated policy on NN NN adaptation and most of its responses to weather disasters were “ reactive ” , he VBD by email . In a social NN post , Russian youth NN activists in DT Fridays for Future group welcomed DT JJ plan but VBD “ as always , DT Russian NN is in no hurry and is turning a blind eye to DT sky - rocketing average temperature on DT NN ” . While acknowledging IN DT NN is heating up and NN NN poses a serious threat to Russia , NNP Vladimir Putin expressed doubt over whether NN NN is man-made at his end - of - NN press conference . Russia ’s greenhouse gas NNS have declined significantly since 1990 , mainly due to plummeting industrial production after DT collapse of DT Soviet economy . In recent NNS EX has been a minor increase in NNS , but PRP are still about 30 % lower than 1990 levels . DT country ’s NNS reduction target for 2030 , set in 2015 , is to limit greenhouse gases to 70 - 75 % of 1990 levels , which analysts consider unambitious and insufficient to help meet JJ targets to curb NN . WWF - Russia ’s Kokorin emphasized DT need for a sharper focus on cutting greenhouse gas NNS . “ Adaptation has clear limits and PRP are not far from these limits , ” he VBD . DT JJ adaptation framework will form part of wider NN legislation , including a long - term low - carbon strategy , set to be adopted later this NN , after Russia formally joined DT Paris NN accord last September . Meanwhile , DT NN has publicly stated IN PRP hopes to capitalize on greater access to Arctic shipping routes and natural resources - including oil , gas and minerals - as Russia ’s frozen north heats up . DT amount of land available for growing crops is RB set to increase , DT adaptation plan VBD , while livestock breeding MD become more efficient and boreal forests grow faster . But WWF - Russia ’s Kokorin warned of “ pitfalls ” and a risk of negative feedback cycles . PRP include faster NN caused by melting permafrost which releases large amounts of methane , a potent greenhouse gas . Any boost to forest growth MD be outweighed by forest fires and unsustainable logging , Kokorin added . And damage to agriculture from hotter temperatures was likely to be larger than DT benefits , with soils poor in DT NN north and droughts hitting DT south , he VBD . “ Yes , ( NN NN ) is positive for DT Russian north , but PRP will be very small compared to DT south , where DT negative effects will be more significant , ” he VBD ."

Adversaries have locked horns and PRP is impossible to have a civilized debate . PRP are either for or against , right or wrong , good or evil . EX is no room for anything in between . EX is simply no NN to talk , DT end is nigh . Now is DT NN for action , not words . Alarm bells are ringing everywhere . EX is no doubt , DT NN is important : This is about melting glaciers , withering landscapes , rising NN levels and starving polar bears . What always gets left out , however , are DT steps already being taken to make sure less CO2 is released into DT atmosphere . DT things WDT make factories cleaner , lower automobile NNS or even cut them altogether by VBG electric . In most NNS , such measures are brushed off by critics as "" greenwashing . "" Here are a couple of randomly chosen examples of steps already being taken : 10 NNS ago , DT German steel manufacturer Salzgitter started something PRP called its EnergyEfficiency project . Since then , PRP has saved a million tons of CO2 , as well as consuming 3,300 Terajoule less NN each NN — enough to power some 55,000 households . Another example is Washington NNP Ferries , DT NN 's second - largest ferry operator . DT company is currently in DT process of converting its fleet — which had consumed some 75 million liters ( 20 million gallons ) of diesel fuel annually — to battery power . But why ? Because Governor Jay Inslee signed a law mandating PRP . But DT head of DT company has RB VBN DT NN is n't just about conforming to DT JJ law . He says PRP 's a good idea , adding IN PRP do n't have to be an environmental activist to appreciate DT fact IN PRP means quieter boats , less pollution and more financial savings . More and more companies are VBG green Just recently , during DT latest COP25 JJ NN conference in Madrid , some 180 companies RB committed themselves to ambitious environmental goals , pledging to cut NNS continuously with DT aim of being carbon neutral by 2050 at DT latest . And these are n't small , niche companies , but rather big JJ corporations IN DT consumer goods producer Beiersdorf ; DT NN 's largest beer producer , Ambev ; and DT International Airline Group , Europe 's third - largest airline holding company ( British Airways and Iberia ) . Such commitments have practically doubled DT number of companies now in DT "" Business Ambition for 1.5˚C : Our Only Future "" alliance since PRP was founded in September of last NN . Admittedly , other things are RB happening , things WDT bewilder activists and realists alike . CD need only look to DT disaster WDT is DT German NN transition . True , DT percentage of NN produced by renewables has gone up , but — according to DT Federal Audit Office – — some € 160 billion ( $ 179 billion ) has RB devoured in DT process . Despite such efforts , DT German solar industry is practically nonexistent and things do n't look much better for DT wind industry . In Germany , NNS prefer to argue about minimum distances between wind turbines and DT next closest village , while our French neighbors negotiate DT construction of six JJ nuclear power plants . Read more : Germany shuts down atomic plant as nuclear phase - out enters final stretch What NN activists really VBP Either way : Is PRP — as NN activists ceaselessly tell PRP — true IN nothing is really happening ? Or have DT topics of sustainability and environmental compatibility finally struck a note with companies ? And if DT latter , is PRP because PRP provide a good sales strategy ? And what MD be wrong with DT if PRP did ? Might PRP not RB make sense to look closer at just what NN activists VBP ? Take Luisa Neubauer , for instance , known here as DT German Greta Thunberg , despite being a few NNS older than DT Swedish teen ; or Carola Rackete , who is internationally known as DT refugee - saving captain of DT ship NNP Watch 3 , but MD prefer to be part of DT Extinction Rebellion movement . Both women have now written books : Rackete called hers "" Act : A Call to DT Last Generation , "" and Neubauer titled hers "" DT End of DT NNP Crisis . "" Both books VBP straight to DT heart of DT matter — PRP are full of ideas for bans and penalties . DT authors call for those who destroy nature to be tried for crimes against humanity . Yet , neither wastes words defending individual rights , arguing IN individuals cannot be trusted to decide whether PRP are for or against NN protection . In interviews given after her book was published , Carola Rackete went further still : "" Everything PRP do , or do n't do , props up DT current system . "" DT 's why civil disobedience is so "" extremely urgent . "" PRP quickly becomes clear IN what these women are after is something much bigger than NN protection : PRP are at war with DT existing JJ system , with free - market economies , and with capitalism . And anyone who is opposed to DT fight , or is of a different opinion , simply can not be right . Only those who are for radical NN protection are among DT good , and only PRP own DT truth . But anyone who so vehemently clamors for an environmental planned economy should take a quick look into DT recent past . PRP MD seem IN DT disastrous NN of DT environment in former East Germany MD be enough to illustrate just how ineffective planned systems are when PRP comes to sustainability and NN protection . So what now ? In such a heated environment — sorry for DT pun — PRP seems EX is no chance of having a rational debate . But PRP have to talk about how PRP are VBG to tackle this challenge , and PRP is becoming increasingly clear IN DT discussion has to take place between different generations — CD WDT has experienced life , and another WDT is impatient . But apocalyptic scenarios prophesying DT end of DT NN wo n't lead anywhere . At DT most , PRP will simply harden opposition among those of a different opinion . DT MD be a shame , because PRP need DT ideas WDT young NNS have to offer . PRP need their youthful nonchalance , their openness and their curiosity . DT young need to show PRP IN PRP can do things better than PRP — but PRP should RB let PRP come along on DT journey , at least for a while ."

JJ different methods6 and experiments have been used to better understand DT differences between 1.5 °C and 2 °C of JJ NN above pre-industrial levels including timeslice extraction from coupled NN model ensembles 7,8 , use of single coupled model ensembles3,9 , multi- model atmosphere - only ensembles2 and pattern scaling 10,11 . PRP is not explicitly stated in DT Paris Agreement text whether DT NN levels refer to equilibrium or transient levels of JJ NN ; however , PRP is generally inferred IN these targets refer to stabilized climate12 . Most of DT analyses WDT were designed to understand DT consequences of these JJ NN targets , especially those focused on atmospheric variables , used transient - model experiments ( analyses of NN - level rise13 and other oceanic variables often use longer coupled - model experiments ) . For example , timeslice extractions under high GHG NNS scenarios from DT fifth phase of DT Coupled Model Intercomparison Project experiment ( CMIP5 ) 1 sample a NN rapidly VBG through DT Paris Agreement limits . Specially designed experiments , such as DT Community NNP System Model ensemble3 , are run to emulate 1.5 °C and 2 °C warmer worlds with evolving radiative forcings for two centuries to generate climates WDT are , in a globally averaged sense for surface air temperature , in a quasi-equilibrium NN . DT atmosphere - only simulations WDT form DT 1.5 °C and 2 °C climates in DT half a degree additional NN , prognosis and projected impacts2 ( HAPPI ) experiment are forced by NN recently observed NN surface temperatures using transient CMIP5 simulations . These different experiments and methods each have differing degrees of transience and none of which are in full equilibrium . Although these experiments all have value , a robust comparison between transient and equilibrium climates has not been possible owing to fundamental differences in model design . Previous research comparing transient and equilibrium climates typically used single JJ NN models 14,15 or a small ensemble of models , such IN agreement and consistency between models MD be investigated 16 . As a result , some differences between transient and equilibrium climates MD be inherent to DT model , or models , WDT were used in these previous analyses . Furthermore , JJ transient simulations of a single model are needed to adequately sample across phases of internal variability to make a robust comparison . Here PRP demonstrate IN transient and quasi-equilibrium climates can be compared using extended medium - NNS simulations and short - term high - NNS simulations from DT CMIP5 multi-model ensemble1 . Our ‘ timeshift technique ’17 enabled PRP to analyse multiple models concurrently , such IN large samples of model NNS were generated for both DT transient and quasi-equilibrium NN NNS . PRP demonstrate IN , for projections of mean and extreme temperatures , DT use of transient or quasi-equilibrium NN NNS has a substantial effect on DT outcomes . PRP used DT extended mid-range GHG NNS simulations to 2300 ( ECP4.5 ) from DT CMIP5 ensemble1 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) to generate a quasi-equilibrium ensemble ( noting IN DT NN of DT twenty - third century is not in full equilibrium ) WDT can be directly compared to transient NN through DT equivalent model ’s level of JJ NN under a high - NNS scenario ( RCP 8.5 ) . DT model - simulated JJ mean NN was subtracted from DT distribution of JJ - average temperatures of each model to generate ensembles for DT comparison of transient and quasi-equilibrium NN NNS ( Fig. 1 ) ; regional average and extreme temperatures were subsequently investigated . DT robustness of this method — particularly DT efficacy of comparing transient and quasi-equilibrium climates derived from a selection of models across JJ NN levels — and associated sensitivity tests are discussed in DT Methods and DT Supplementary Information . Specifically , PRP demonstrate IN DT difference between transient and quasi-equilibrium NN patterns shows little dependence on DT level of JJ NN itself ( Supplementary Information ) , which differs by almost 2 °C across DT models analysed here ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . PRP use this result to enable a comparison of DT difference between transient and quasi-equilibrium climates with DT 0.5 °C increment of NN between DT Paris Agreement NN levels . From DT ensembles of transient and equivalent quasi-equilibrium climates , PRP can infer differences between these NN NNS . For most land areas of DT NN , DT average boreal summer ( June–August ( JJA ) ) and winter ( December–February ( DJF ) ) temperatures are substantially higher in DT transient NN relative to DT equivalent quasi-equilibrium NN with strong model agreement . This is especially true in boreal summer over continental NN zones in DT Northern Hemisphere ( Fig. 2a , b ) . By contrast , over DT Southern Ocean and DT North Atlantic , EX are large areas where a quasi-equilibrium NN is on average at least 0.5 °C warmer than DT equivalent transient NN . In DT quasi-equilibrium NN , DT passage of NN has resulted in heat redistribution such IN DT land regions are cooler and DT extratropical oceans are warmer 14,18 . This result aligns with previous research showing IN ocean NN lags behind NN over DT land surface19 . DT quantification of these differences is important , especially given DT recent focus on inferring differences in future warmer climates . As land regions are warmer in DT transient NN NN , most NNS in DT NN MD experience higher average local temperatures than in a quasi-equilibrium NN . In boreal summer , 91 % of DT NN ’s population20 ( 90 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 76–97 % ) MD experience warmer average temperatures in DT transient NN NN . JJ NNS in North America and Eurasia MD experience at least a 0.5 °C warmer local NN in a transient NN than in DT quasi-equilibrium equivalent NN . In boreal winter , 85 % of DT JJ population ( 90 % CI : 70 –92 % ) are in locations where DT transient NN is warmer than DT quasi-equilibrium NN . In total , more than 600 million NNS in boreal summer and more than 200 million in boreal winter live in locations where a rapidly VBG NN is at least 0.5 °C warmer than DT equivalent equilibrium NN . By contrast , fewer than 20 million NNS live in locations where an equilibrium NN is on average more than 0.5 °C warmer than DT transient equivalent for either boreal summer or winter . DT difference between transient and quasi-equilibrium NN NNS is substantial relative to DT difference between DT projected 1.5 °C and 2 °C warmer worlds 8,11 ( Fig. 3 ) . Over DT Southern Ocean and North Atlantic , where DT regional projected NN from 1.5 °C to 2 °C of JJ NN is lower than elsewhere , DT difference between transient and quasi-equilibrium climates exceeds DT difference in regional temperatures between DT Paris Agreement levels . Both of these regions play major roles in DT uptake and transport of carbon and heat21 , as PRP warm at much slower rates compared with other parts of DT NN . Overall , around 15 % of NNP ’s surface area has a bigger difference between DT transient and quasi-equilibrium climates than between DT Paris Agreement NN levels . This includes both slow - NN ocean areas , where DT quasi-equilibrium 1.5 °C NN is warmer than a transient 2 °C NN , and continental land regions , where DT transient 1.5 °C NN is warmer than a quasi-equilibrium 2 °C NN . For a typical location on NNP ’s surface , DT absolute difference between transient and quasi-equilibrium climates is around 40 % of DT absolute difference between DT Paris NN limits . DT difference between transient and equilibrium climates extends to temperature extremes . DT probability ratio of moderate heat extremes 22 , such as CD - in - ten hot seasons ( Fig. 4a , b ) , shows broad regions where a heat event is twice as likely in DT transient NN ( DT is , a CD - in - five NN event instead ) compared with a quasi-equilibrium NN NN . This is particularly true in boreal summer where , for almost all land regions of DT NN , DT likelihood of a hot season is significantly higher in a transient NN compared with DT equivalent quasi-equilibrium NN . Regions with at least a doubling in DT probability of hot summers in a transient NN compared with a quasi-equilibrium NN of equivalent JJ NN encompass major cities including NNP York City , Istanbul , Baghdad , Seoul and Tokyo . Although this is a JJ - scale analysis , PRP MD infer IN for these densely populated locations , DT heat - related impacts of human - induced NN NN MD be lessened in a stabilized NN compared with a rapidly VBG NN at DT same level of JJ NN . A similar pattern of results was found when examining cold extremes , with far fewer cold seasons ( below DT 10th percentile extracted from DT quasi- equilibrium NN ) in DT transient NN NN in Northern Hemisphere land areas ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ) . Overlaying estimates of gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita20 show IN poorer areas of DT NN tend to experience greater probability of hot seasons in a transient NN than a quasi-equilibrium equivalent ( in DJF DT correlation is − 0.39 , although in JJA PRP is negligible ) . EX is a large benefit of NN stabilization in terms of reduced frequency of hot extremes relative to a rapidly VBG NN at DT same JJ NN level , and this is particularly true for DT developing NN , in which DT likelihood of hot seasons is reduced NN - round . JJ analyses written for DT IPCC SR1.5 have focused on understanding changes in hot and cold extremes between DT Paris Agreement JJ NN limits 8,23 , 24 . DT results presented in this NN demonstrate IN DT difference in DT frequency of hot and cold extremes between a transient and quasi-equilibrium NN NN at a given level of JJ NN is RB large for JJ populated regions of DT NN . DT frequency of hot summers in a NN where JJ - average temperature rapidly passes through a JJ NN level relative to equilibrating at DT level is substantially greater in DT Middle East , much of Eurasia and northern Africa , and North America . Results from some studies of future extremes , such as ref. 23 , MD apply to transient 1.5 °C and 2 °C warmer worlds , but MD probably represent substantial overestimates for changes in DT frequency of heat extremes for equilibrium 1.5 °C and 2 °C climates relative to DT present . DT comparison of RCP 8.5 and ECP4.5 simulations from a multi- model ensemble enabled PRP to isolate DT effects of DT transient and quasi-equilibrium nature of DT different model experiments . This enabled PRP to address a fundamental question about DT nature of DT NNP ’s NN system : what differences in NN MD PRP expect between transient and equilibrium warmer worlds for a given level of JJ NN ? This is a vitally important question in DT context of international agreements such as DT Paris Agreement , for which analyses using transient and equilibrium NN model experiments MD yield different results and lead to DT formation of different conclusions and policy pathways . PRP is worth noting IN some of DT largest differences between transient and quasi-equilibrium NN NNS are identified for regions WDT are poorly observed and where model biases exist , such as DT Southern Ocean25 . As a result , projections for DT Southern Ocean should be treated with caution , although PRP generally align with our understanding of DT NN system19 . Further discussion of DT results for DT Southern Ocean is provided in DT Supplementary Information . DT differences between transient and equilibrium NN NNS have important implications in impact modelling . For example , some empirical impact models , such as damage functions 26 , are based on JJ - average NN , but in reality PRP MD expect different JJ costs to occur between transient and equilibrium warmer worlds for both DT globe as a whole26 and individual NNS 27 , especially developing NNS in DT tropics , due to DT different patterns of regional NN . Differences in methods used to simulate future climates and their impacts have DT potential to lead to decision - makers receiving inadequate information about DT nature of possible future climates for their region of interest . This MD result in DT development of ineffective policy , especially in building resilience for future extreme heat events , which is already more challenging in DT developing world28 . JJ of our results suggest IN DT differences between transient and quasi-equilibrium climates are substantial . A future 1.5 °C or 2 °C quasi-equilibrium warmer NN reached after an overshoot ( DT is , in NNS in which JJ NN has exceeded these limits but then fallen ) MD probably look very different to DT equivalent transient 1.5 °C or 2 °C NN WDT DT NN is likely to experience in DT coming decades 29,30 . Indeed , a transient warmer NN represents a poor predictor for an equivalent equilibrium NN in JJ populated land regions where DT difference in average seasonal temperatures is at least 0.5 °C and DT likelihood of hot extremes is at least twice as high in some places under DT transient NN . Studies of DT implications of future JJ NN must therefore be very clear in their framing of results with respect to DT transience of DT experiments used for their conclusions to be relevant for policy development . Current multi-model projection efforts , such as CMIP5 ( ref. 1 ) and DT subsequent CMIP6 ( ref. 4 ) projects , do not incorporate experiments WDT explicitly address DT needs of policy - makers following DT Paris Agreement . Multi - model experiments WDT can be used to examine NN NN at stabilized 1.5 °C and 2 °C warmer climates MD be invaluable in meeting DT needs of decision - makers given IN DT Paris Agreement is implicitly targeting stabilized JJ NN levels12 and IN PRP have demonstrated here IN DT rate of JJ NN has a large effect on DT NN pattern across DT globe . Although single - model experiments have been performed previously3 , these are not a substitute for multi- model projections WDT can more comprehensively examine DT impacts of DT Paris Agreement JJ NN levels . Our NN highlights DT notable differences in model - simulated transient and quasi-equilibrium NN NNS . PRP find IN these differences are significant and substantial across JJ regions of DT NN , such IN PRP must be considered in DT design of both model studies on DT implications of future JJ NN , and in DT design of future multi- model experiments following CMIP5 and CMIP6 . Studies must be clear in DT precise definition of temperature targets and DT framework given DT differing implications of a given level of JJ NN depending on DT transience of DT NN NN ."

In DT thirty NNS since , those projections of what MD happen in a VBG NN have proven to be remarkably prescient . “ PRP ’ve already observed some of DT things PRP expected in 1989 , ” VBD Susan Fischer Wilhelm , a research manager at DT California NNP Commission , DT agency WDT compiled DT report . DT assessment laid DT groundwork for what has arguably become DT country ’s most ambitious effort to address JJ NN . But to JJ who worked on DT report , looking back on PRP now only underscores how long PRP ’ve waited to act — and how much NN has been wasted . “ I felt a sense of pride of being able to participate in something IN this , but RB a sense of regret for PRP as a society , ” VBD Les Baxter , who worked on DT report as a policy analyst at DT CEC and is now vice NN of program strategy for DT Pew Charitable Trusts . “ PRP ’ve known what PRP need to do and PRP just keep refusing to do PRP . ” DT report might have remained lost to history if Gary Estes had n’t been VBG through boxes in his garage last NN and stumbled upon a copy . For decades , Estes has organized DT annual California Extreme Precipitation Symposium . And he decided to use this NN ’s meeting as an opportunity to look back at DT 185 - page report . “ I thought PRP MD be an appropriate thing to do 30 NNS later , ” VBD Estes , a citizen activist and self - described “ NN nut . ” DT symposium , held this week at UC Davis , brought together university and NN NNS to discuss report ’s findings . Its NN - specific projections were drawn from scientific studies and assessments by DT U.S. Environmental Protection Agency WDT were released in DT late 1980s , as well as from detailed analyses conducted by NN agencies . “ I was impressed with DT level of rigor WDT PRP were able to bring , ” VBD Wilhelm , who gave a presentation at DT symposium outlining what PRP knew then and what PRP VBP now . DT report explained IN doubling DT concentration of carbon dioxide in DT atmosphere MD raise temperatures in California by roughly 3 degrees Celsius — which will happen by mid-century if NNS continue to rise , according to DT most recent California NNP NNP Assessment . Then , as now , NN models showed no clear NN in DT NN ’s average annual precipitation . But DT authors noted IN 3 degrees of NN MD reduce DT area of mountain snow cover by half . And PRP MD increase DT frequency and severity of winter floods , as more NN fell as rain instead of snow . ( Both changes have already started to occur , Wilhelm VBD . ) In contrast , spring runoff MD drop by a third . ( PRP ’ve already fallen over DT last century , Wilhelm VBD . ) DT authors added IN , although EX was still debate among NNS at DT NN , NN NN MD RB bring more variable weather . DT report outlined DT ways in which changes in DT seasonal pattern of precipitation MD pose problems for DT NN ’s reservoirs , which MD have to release NN during DT rainy season to avoid overflowing . ( DT ’s exactly what happened in DT DT 2017 Oroville Dam crisis . ) In DT summer , NN shortages MD impact ecosystems , farmers and hydropower production , DT authors wrote . Heat and drought MD stress forests , which MD likely “ experience lower growth and higher susceptibility to fires , insects , and NN . ” ( This , too , has come to pass . ) DT report RB warned IN NN NN MD raise NN level , increase electricity demand , worsen air quality , increase heat - related deaths and be a drain on DT NN ’s economy . “ PRP strikes me IN PRP were right on , ” VBD Kari Smith , now a division manager at DT San Jose Clean NNP department who helped oversee DT report when she worked at DT CEC . “ I do n’t VB EX was anything WDT PRP VBD WDT is radically off - base . ” If anything , she VBD , DT report underestimated DT degree to which NN impacts are interrelated . For instance , in 1989 , few foresaw IN wildfire risk MD cause utilities to consider cutting power to thousands of residents , jeopardizing DT reliability of electricity . DT report came about after DT legislature asked DT CEC to assess “ DT effect of JJ NN trends on California ’s NN , economy , environment , agriculture , and NN . ” Soon after , DT CEC released DT NN ’s first inventory of greenhouse gas NNS in 1990 and a set of NN policy recommendations in 1991 . AB 4420 , DT 1988 bill WDT mandated DT reports , was introduced by Byron Sher , a Stanford law professor and NN politician best known for authoring California ’s clean air and safe drinking NN acts . JJ NN had just begun to seep into DT JJ consciousness . Alarmed by signs of environmental NN and DT results of early NN models , NNS were VBG JJ with their concerns about what JJ then called DT “ greenhouse effect . ” Sher immediately saw DT threat to California . “ DT heat is on , ” he told DT Sacramento Bee in 1989 . “ DT NN can either ignore what NN is telling PRP or PRP can respond to this challenge in a responsible way . ” Sher ’s bill was part of a flurry of bipartisan political activity on NN NN across DT country . In his 1988 presidential campaign , George H.W. Bush vowed to combat DT greenhouse effect with “ DT White House effect . ” In Congress , Democrats and Republicans introduced more than a dozen bills to curb atmospheric pollution . Several called for reducing greenhouse gas NNS to 20 % below 1988 levels by DT NN 2000 . ( Around DT same NN , DT NN agreed to phase out ozone - destroying substances under an agreement WDT NNP Reagan helped negotiate . ) By comparison , AB 4420 was relatively modest , VBD Kip Lipper , who was Sher ’s chief of staff and helped draft DT bill . But AB 4420 had DT distinction of actually passing . ( DT assembly voted 58 to 13 in favor of DT bill ; DT senate voted 38-0 . “ PRP ’s DT first law enacted anywhere in DT NNP NNPS WDT used DT term ‘ JJ NN , ’ ” VBD Lipper , who still serves as DT chief policy advisor for NN and environment to DT NN pro tem of DT NN senate . Lipper VBD DT report did n’t make a big splash . But PRP did provide a basis for everything WDT came later , including DT NN ’s renewable NN portfolio standard and its cap - and - trade program . “ PRP tried to seed DT ground , if PRP will , by saying , ‘ Let ’s just VB a report . Let ’s have this task force look at this , ” he VBD . PRP MD be 12 NNS before DT next piece of NN legislation passed . And AB 32 — which set DT NN ’s first NNS reduction target — did n’t become law until 2006 . DT reasons for DT slow response are familiar : DT daunting scope of NN NN , DT challenges of transitioning away from fossil fuels , and tenacious opposition by industry . But JJ say EX was RB uncertainty about DT reality of NN NN in DT 1980s . While DT report found IN JJ NN posed a significant risk to California , PRP RB acknowledged IN DT matter was n’t entirely settled . In fact , DT authors devoted six pages to “ Challenges to DT NNP NNP Concept . ” Baxter felt IN DT theory was solid , but IN EX was n’t enough evidence IN PRP was happening yet . “ I remember thinking to myself , ‘ Well , PRP ’ll VB enough in 20 or 25 NNS , ’ ” he VBD . Such reservations made PRP hard for politicians to push for action , even if PRP cared deeply about JJ NN , Smith VBD . “ PRP was difficult to lead with NN NN for a long NN because PRP was considered maybe a little radical . ” Instead , leaders looked for ways to VB at NN mitigation by focusing on other objectives , IN improving air quality and NN efficiency . DT was a start , but not enough to tackle DT problem , she VBD . Today , NNS have no doubts about NN NN and Californians see DT impacts all around them . “ PRP now have observed data — not projections , nothing speculative — to show NN - related trends WDT are already affecting DT NN in ways WDT were anticipated 30 NNS ago , ” Wilhelm VBD . Indeed , if DT report ’s authors erred in any way , PRP was IN PRP did n’t anticipate just how fast these changes MD occur . “ PRP thought IN PRP had at least 100 NNS before PRP became existential , ” Smith VBD . “ Now , 30 NNS later , PRP ’re recognizing IN PRP all happened a lot more quickly than PRP anticipated . ”"

To achieve this objective , JJ NNS should peak as soon as possible and carbon neutrality should be achieved by DT second half of DT century . DT EU supports these objectives : PRP aims to reduce its greenhouse gas NNS by 80 - 95 % by 2050 compared with 1990 levels , and its Member NNPS each set and pursue national emission reduction targets . In DT shorter term , DT EU has set a target to reduce greenhouse gas NNS levels by at least 40 % below 1990 levels by 2030 . Greenhouse gases are emitted through both natural processes and human activities . DT primary natural greenhouse gas in DT atmosphere is NN vapour . However , human activities release large amounts of other greenhouse gases , which increases their atmospheric concentration and enhances DT greenhouse effect , thus VBG DT NN . DT main sources of greenhouse gases from human activities are : • burning of fossil fuels ( coal , oil and gas ) in electricity generation , transport , industry and households ( CO ) ; • land use NN and deforestation ( CO ) ; • land filling of waste ( methane from decomposition ) ; and Several EU initiatives aim to cut greenhouse gas NNS . Having achieved its objectives under DT Kyoto Protocol for DT period from 2008 to 2012 , DT EU adopted a target to reduce greenhouse gas NNS further , to levels 20 % below those of 1990 by 2020 . To achieve this target , a cap was set for DT EU NNPS Trading System ( ETS ) . For NNS in sectors not covered by DT ETS , individual national targets were set under DT Effort Sharing Decision . At DT same NN , DT EU has adopted legislation to increase DT use of renewable NN , such as wind , solar , hydro and biomass , and to improve DT NN efficiency of a wide array of equipment and household appliances . DT EU RB aims to support DT development of carbon capture and storage technologies to trap and store CO emitted by power stations and other large installations . As part of a framework of NN and NN policies , DT EU has set a binding target to cut NNS in DT EU territory by 2030 to levels at least 40 % below those in 1990 . NNS from land use , land - use NN and forestry have RB been incorporated into DT EU ’s emission reduction efforts . DT European NNP Union , which aims to ensure IN Europe has secure , affordable and NN - friendly NN , reinforces this objective . By providing information on NN NN in Europe and its Member NNPS , DT EEA supports DT implementation of European legislation on NN NN mitigation , DT evaluation of EU policies and DT development of long - term mitigation strategies . DT EEA provides data , indicators , assessments and reports on greenhouse gas NNS trends , projections , and policies and measures in Europe . DT EEA works closely with EU institutions ( for example DT European Commission ) , experts from its European Topic Centre on NNP NNP Mitigation and NNP ( ETC / CME ) and its environment information and observation network ( Eionet ) . Key activities and products include DT annual compilation of DT official European Union greenhouse gas inventory and DT annual assessment of DT progress of EU and other European NNS towards their NN and NN targets .

In other words , rather than adopting policies and practices to slow DT rise in JJ temperatures , humanity is essentially continuing on DT same suicidal course PRP ’s been on for decades . And , of course , NNP administration policies seeking ever more fossil fuel production in DT U.S. are exactly opposite of what PRP need to do . DT NNS Gap Report is DT first U.N. effort to compare projected JJ NNS with DT stated goals of DT 2015 Paris agreement , in which NN governments acknowledged DT looming danger and pledged to take steps to limit NNS of greenhouse gases . DT agreement , which aimed to limit DT rise in JJ temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels , was shepherded by DT Obama administration ; NNP NNP ’s decision to withdraw from DT pact MD leave DT U.S. , despite its key role in forging DT agreement , as a JJ outlier , DT sole country not a party to PRP . DT JJ report extrapolates from NNS data from DT U.S. and seven other nations WDT account for 60 % of JJ fossil fuel production . PRP RB builds on an earlier report WDT projects IN even if nations meet their current commitments under DT Paris agreement temperatures MD still rise somewhere between 3 and 4 degrees Celsius . Even more troublesome : JJ carbon NNS “ have remained exactly at DT levels projected a decade ago , under DT business - as - usual scenarios used in NNS Gap Reports , ” wrote Inger Andersen , executive director of DT Environment Program . DT spotlights a key hurdle in making meaningful changes in how PRP create and consume NN . Too JJ nations pursue too JJ policies — from pushing increased fossil fuel production to subsidies for coal , oil and gas industries — WDT work against their promised reductions in NNS . EX is no easy way to fix this , but EX are some pretty clear steps WDT MD be taken , including dropping tax breaks and subsidies for DT fuels WDT are imperiling PRP , thus letting market prices more accurately reflect DT true cost ; changing DT market itself by using NN policies , including carbon taxes , to push a rapid JJ transition to renewable NN ; and helping developing nations whose demands for power are growing to build renewable NN infrastructures WDT do not rely on fossil fuels . And PRP must do this with a sense of urgency , and without deluding ourselves about DT fate WDT awaits PRP if PRP do not ."

And DT bona fide blizzard WDT has frozen much of DT Northeast just a few days after winter officially began definitely qualifies as major . But while piles of snow blocking your driveway hardly conjure images of a dangerously VBG NN , PRP does n't mean IN NN NN is a myth . DT NNP Meteorological Organization recently reported IN 2010 is almost certainly VBG to be CD of DT three warmest NNS on record , while 2001 to 2010 is already DT hottest decade in recorded history . Indeed , according to some NNS , all of these events MD actually be connected . CD theory is IN a warmer Arctic MD actually lead to colder and snowier winters in DT northern mid-latitudes . Even as NNS IN Britain  suffering through DT coldest December on record  deal with low temperatures and unusual snow , DT Arctic has kept on NN , with Greenland and Arctic Canada experiencing DT hottest NN on record . Temperatures in DT region have been 5.4 °F to 7.2 °F ( 3 °C to 4 °C ) above normal in 2010 . As a result , DT Arctic sea-ice cover has continued to shrink ; this September , DT minimum summer sea-ice extent was more than 770,000 sq. mi. ( 2 million sq km ) below DT long - term average , and DT third - smallest on record . Snow MD be piling up in midtown Manhattan , but DT Arctic is continuing its long - term meltdown . DT loss of Arctic NN NN helps accelerate DT NN of DT atmosphere in DT far north , thanks to what 's known as DT albedo effect . White NN reflects sunlight into space , cooling DT air , but when NN melts and is replaced with dark ocean NN , DT effect is reversed and more of DT sun 's heat is absorbed . As DT Arctic air warms , PRP raises DT altitude of discrete areas of high pressure , which can then alter wind patterns . This , in turn , can weaken DT jet stream , allowing more cold air to seep out of DT Arctic and into Europe and DT eastern U.S. As DT authors of DT National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's recent "" Arctic Report Card "" put PRP , "" EX is evidence IN DT effect of higher air temperatures in DT lower Arctic atmosphere in fall is contributing to changes in DT atmospheric circulation in both DT Arctic and northern mid-latitudes . Winter 2009 - 2010 showed a JJ connectivity between mid-latitude extreme cold and snowy weather events and changes in DT wind patterns of DT Arctic ; DT so - called Warm Arctic Cold Continents pattern . "" DT theory seems counterintuitive , but as Jeff Masters , a meteorologist who writes DT great Wunder Blog at Weather Underground , put PRP in a recent post , PRP makes sense : "" This pattern is kind of IN leaving DT refrigerator door ajar  DT refrigerator warms up , but all DT cold air spills out into DT house . "" DT NN overall is still VBG  and DT Arctic fastest of all  but DT cold air from DT far north can result in biting winter weather and major storms , for a while at least . DT 's not DT only theory . Judah Cohen , DT director of seasonal forecasting at DT environmental research firm AER , has written IN increasing seasonal snow cover in Siberia MD drive extreme winter weather . Even as DT NN has continued to warm and DT Arctic has melted , seasonal snow cover has increased in Siberia , especially north of high Asian mountain ranges IN DT Himalayas . ( As DT NN warms overall , DT atmosphere can hold more moisture , which can lead to more precipitation  falling as snow in places IN Siberia WDT remain relatively cold . ) All IN Siberian snow creates a dome of cold air near DT mountains , which bends DT passing jet stream . Instead of flowing west to east , DT jet stream moves in a more north to south fashion , carrying cold air south from DT Arctic in DT eastern U.S. and in Europe . Cohen 's theory is n't accepted by all NN and weather NNS , but DT National NNP Foundation has VBN IN in past NNS his model has predicted winter weather more accurately than traditional forecasts . Of course , PRP 's important to remember IN weather is n't DT same as NN  a single storm , or even a single cold winter , can tell PRP little about DT overall NN . Anomalies do happen , and sometimes PRP dump 20 inches ( 50 cm ) of snow on Central Park . DT systems WDT govern weather on this NN are incredibly complex , and our ability to understand why individual events occur  and to forecast them for DT future  is still imperfect . DT more than anything is what drives  and distorts  so much of DT stubborn debate over NN NN . Just because NN models predict IN DT NN will continue to heat up in DT future as PRP continue to pour greenhouse - gas NNS into DT atmosphere does n't mean IN NN will be a steady , even process . Far from PRP  and as parts of DT NN warm far faster than others , extreme events , including winter ones , MD become more common . JJ Yorkers cursing Al Gore as PRP dig out their cars should recall this past July  DT second hottest month on record in DT city . Unfortunately , DT unpredictability is VBG to make adapting to a warmer NN even tougher . As NN NN appears to trigger harsher winter events in parts of DT NN , DT 's not an effect WDT will last forever . As DT NN warms , even cold air from DT Arctic or Siberia MD not be enough to offset DT greenhouse effect , and major snowstorms IN DT NN DT Northeast just experienced MD be a thing of DT past . DT might make for less snow shoveling  but on DT whole , PRP wo n't be a very pleasant NN to live on . See photos of how JJ NN threatens penguins ."

Adapting to NN NN will be necessary regardless of how much PRP manage to cut our NNS , as historic NNS have already changed our NN and will continue to do so in decades to come . DT NNP NNP ( Scotland ) Act 2009 placed a duty on ministers to lay a programme for NN NN adaptation before DT Scottish Parliament as soon as reasonably practicable after DT UK NNP NNP Risk Assessment ( UKCCRA ) , DT latest of which includes a summary report for Scotland . DT Act RB requires an annual report on progress and for DT advisory body , DT Committee for NNP NNP Adaptation Sub Committee ( ASC ) , to prepare a report within two NNS , setting out its independent assessment of DT progress made on objectives , proposals and policies set out in DT programme . DT second Scottish NNP NNP Adaptation Programme ( SCCAP ) to help prepare for DT impact of NN NN was launched in September 2019 . PRP addresses DT risks set out in DT UK NNP NNP Risk Assessment ( UK CCRA ) 2017 , published under section 56 of DT UK NNP NNP Act 2008 . DT SCCAP ’s outcomes - based approach is derived from both DT UN Sustainable Development Goals and Scotland ’s National Performance Framework . DT programme has been aligned with DT UN Sustainable Development Goals to ensure PRP complements our international ambitions . Its launch coincided with a NNP Nations NNP Action summit in NNP York . DT first SCCAP was launched in NNP 2014 , with DT aim of increasing DT resilience of Scotland 's NNS , environment and economy to DT impacts of a changing NN . DT ASC 's first independent assessment of DT first SCCAP recognised DT SCCAP as a positive start in taking steps to prepare for NN NN . DT final assessment of DT first SCCAP was published in March 2019 and found IN EX had been notable progress since DT first assessment , but EX was still some continuing concern and gaps remaining in key evidence and data , which PRP expected to be considered in DT second SCCAP . PRP have published annual progress reports since 2015 . DT first annual progress report on DT second SCCAP was published in NNP 2020 and can be viewed below : DT annual progress reports on DT first SCCAP can be accessed as follows : PRP fund Adaptation Scotland to provide advice and support to help organisations , businesses and communities adapt to DT impacts of NN NN .

( Wow , dear , did PRP see James won again ? ) DT NN scientist Joseph Majkut quipped IN DT tone of this NN ’s announcement was less “ See , see PRP told PRP ” and more “ Well , duh . ” Schmidt , DT NASA scientist , nodded at this during DT briefing . “ DT fact is , DT NN is VBG , and every NN PRP add CD extra data point to this graph , which MD not seem IN a terribly important thing , but NNS seem interested , ” he VBD . “ DT main thing here is not DT ranking … but DT consistency of DT long - term trend PRP ’re seeing . ” Virtually every important NN record has been broken and re-broken over DT past few NNS : DT past five NNS are DT five warmest NNS on record , DT past six DT warmest six , DT past nine DT warmest nine . Since Donald NNP rode down his gilded escalator and announced he was running for NN , DT NN has experienced its hottest recorded version of each individual month , according to NOAA . So PRP ’s worth VBG back in history to see just how outlandish our current situation is . DT median American is a little more than 38 NNS old . DT NN before she was born was 1980 . PRP was , at DT NN , DT hottest NN ever measured . A July heat wave WDT NN killed 1,265 Americans and caused more than $ 20 billion in damage nationwide . DT larger significance of this milestone was not well understood at DT NN . In an op - ed DT summer , a weatherman in Westchester , NNP York , expressed so much regret about giving in and buying a car with an air conditioner WDT he wondered whether Americans of his demographic were “ less tolerant of extreme heat than our parents and grandparents . ” His parents ’ generation made do without air - conditioned cars , he figured , and his grandparents did n’t even have electric ceiling fans . Were PRP a tougher breed ? PRP were not , he learned : DT weather had gotten warmer . He was shocked . “ PRP came as a great surprise to discover IN during DT first three decades of this century EX were fewer heat waves ( 27 ) than during DT last three ( 49 ) , ” he wrote in DT NNP York Times . “ My hat is off to DT present generation … If PRP create our own cooler environment with air conditioners , well then , PRP deserve PRP . ” His editorial did not mention JJ NN or “ DT greenhouse effect , ” as PRP was then called . And DT hottest - NN record probably did seem IN a fluke : 1980 was DT first NN DT record had been broken in 35 NNS . In 1981 , DT median American was born , a happy and healthy statistical girl . DT NN inched even hotter , setting a JJ all - NN record a few hundredths of a degree Celsius warmer than 1980’s . Then , in 1983 , as she learned to string sentences together , DT record was smashed again . DT JJ hottest - NN record had now been broken three times in four NNS ."

Over DT past NN , millions of young NNS have flooded DT streets of cities around DT NN demanding political leaders take urgent steps to stop NN NN , inspired by 17 - NN - old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg . DT BBC Newsround conducted DT JJ survey to VB understand how DT young generation feels about DT impact NN NN MD have on their future .

Almost three in five , about 58 percent , of NNS are concerned about what NN changes means for their future . And approximately CD percent shared PRP are having nightmares about DT NN crisis . When questioned about DT action being taken by grown - ups to tackle DT problem , a large number of NNS VBD PRP feel frustrated about DT progress being made . Emma Citron , a consultant clinical child psychologist , VBD IN young NNS often find PRP difficult to come to terms with DT scale of DT problem of NN changes and what often seems IN a lack of response shown by governments and NN leaders . ' JJ figures IN David Attenborough and Greta Thunberg have helped young NNS to voice their worries and PRP have to make sure IN PRP as adults listen to them and ... help them become involved in positive NN , ' she VBD in a statement .

' DT American Psychological Association has VBN PRP was aware of reports of growing ' eco-anxiety ' in NNS , but research was needed to establish how common PRP was .

Email_NN :_: [_-LRB- email_NN protected_VBN ]_-RRB-","Despite DT Internet , connectivity , and linking technologies , distance has not shrunk DT Australian sense of self , an often provincial appraisal of DT NN seen in slow motion and stills . Whether PRP ’s DT “ flower revolution ” or Michel Foucault , trends and ideas are often delayed , and seem almost cutely anachronistic by DT NN PRP make landfall down under . Wedded to DT insatiable urge to reap , rent and remove from DT NN , and PRP have DT ultimate myopic : Australia , DT exceptional country , outside DT stream of history and , dare PRP be VBN , DT inconveniences of NN . With some 11,000 NNS warning IN NN NNP “ clearly and unequivocally faces a NN emergency ” , some sense of PRP was registered on DT Australian political scene , if only barely . DT “ NNP NNPS ’ Warning of a NN Emergency ” published in BioScience does not shy away from DT language of catastrophe and emergency . “ Despite 40 NNS of JJ NN negotiations … PRP have generally conducted business as usual and have largely failed to address this predicament . ” NN NN had not merely arrived but bulldozed itself into recognition , “ accelerating faster than JJ NNS expected . ” DT authors and signatories suggest IN , “ An immense increase of scale in endeavours to conserve our biosphere is needed to avoid untold suffering due to DT NN crisis . ” JJ debates on DT subject of NN NN had mostly focused on JJ surface temperature , a clearly inadequate approach WDT avoids “ DT breath of human activities and DT real dangers stemming from a VBG NN . ” Areas of urgent redress were RB suggested . NN efficiency and a reduction in DT use of fossil fuels are high on DT list . “ PRP need a carbon - free economy WDT explicitly addresses human dependence on DT biosphere and policies WDT guide JJ decisions accordingly . ” DT call for a NN of language is encouraged : rhetoric of GDP growth and affluence needs to be replaced by sustainability “ and improving human well - being by prioritizing basic needs and reducing inequality . ” Not exactly music for DT muscular fossil fuel lobby . Another song sheet WDT MD not have impressed DT fossil fuel industries was an event WDT barely disturbed DT press releases . This month , DT National Electricity Market in Australia received a contribution from wind , solar and hydro NN amounting to half of DT total NN production . Rooftop solar contributions came in at 23.7 percent , with wind ( 15.7 percent ) , large - scale solar ( 8.8 percent ) and hydro ( 1.9 percent ) bringing up DT rear . With DT release of DT report , Australia braced itself for DT incinerating fury of bush fires WDT have arrived earlier this season . DT NN of NNP South Wales is anticipating what DT Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons describes as “ DT most dangerous bushfire week this nation has ever seen ” . DT warnings were already pressing through DT policy pipeline in DT last decade . DT National Inquiry on Bushfire Mitigation and Management ’s 2004 report to DT Council of Australian NNP warned IN , “ Fires ’ frequency , intensity and size are expected to increase under NN NN as temperatures rise , rainfall variability increases , droughts become more severe and ecosystem dynamics alter , resulting in changed biomass fuel loads and types . ” DT authors of DT report VBP on to suggest IN “ projected hotter , drier and windier conditions associated with NN NN caused by greenhouse NN MD extend DT period of fuel drying and increase rates of fire spread . ” Earlier this NN , former NSW Fires Chief Greg Mullins and 22 other emergency honchos warned Prime Minister Morrison of DT dangers WDT MD face Australia this summer , suggesting IN DT NN meet to discuss some form of action against risks of conflagration . DT meeting has yet to take place , leaving such politicians as Adam Bandt , DT Greens MP for Melbourne , certain IN Morrison “ bears some responsibility and must apologise to DT communities impacted ” . Various Australian politicians , as then , were having none of PRP . Charged with DT task of keeping a plunderer ’s lifestyle in perpetuity , DT well - fed pigs in clover , DT following words of DT BioScience report sit uncomfortably with members of DT Morrison NN . “ DT NN crisis is closely linked to excessive consumption of DT wealthy lifestyle . DT most affluent NNS are mainly responsible for DT historical GHG NNS and generally have DT greatest per capita NNS . ” DT Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack preferred some tea and sympathy in responding to DT victims of DT fires , not policy and prognosis . “ PRP do n’t need DT ravings of some pure enlightened and woke capital city greenies at this NN when PRP are trying to save their homes . ” McCormack ’s primary target was DT Green party itself , which he accused of fiddling politically while Australia burned . “ DT ’s what Adam Bandt , and DT Greens , and Richard Di Natale , and all those other inner-city raving lunatics – and quite frankly , DT ’s how he was carrying on yesterday – DT ’s what PRP VBP , PRP ’re not VBG to VB down DT path . ” Other politicians have adopted a similar approach : DT now is what matters , and never mind previous failings and future disasters . NSW Premier Gladys Berejikilian provided DT stellar example . “ For any of PRP on DT ground , speaking to NNS traumatised , speaking to NNS fighting fires for weeks … VB exactly what DT priorities should be , and DT is saving life and property ” . NN NN , in other words , was something for another day , another slot in DT packed meeting schedule . Morrison reiterated DT position . He was “ focused on DT needs of DT NNS ” . He spoke of having “ firefighters out RB saving someone else ’s house while their own house is burning down , and when PRP are in DT sort of situation , DT is where attention must be . ” Mayors from DT areas most affected by DT recent conflagration have been crankily unimpressed by DT platitudes . NN NN literature , PRP surmise , is being assiduously avoided by DT NN . DT unfortunately named Carol Sparks , Mayor of Glen Innes , site of two deaths over DT weekend , suggested IN McCormack needed “ to read DT NN , and DT is what I am VBG by , is DT NN . ” Forget , suggested DT mayor , DT politics here . NN had imposed its cold , objective hand on DT matter . Mid Coast Mayor Claire Pontin was similarly riled , notably by suggestions IN fires were DT staple of Australian life and landscape . “ PRP ’ve not had situations IN DT . Fifty NNS ago , this MD never happen . ” EX are few incentives for humanity to adapt than through DT infliction of catastrophic conditions . Pandemics , NN wars and existential risk have done their bit in propelling NN . But luxury produces complacency ; well fed bellies induce sloth . Come DT writing of humanity ’s extensive biography of preying on DT NN , Australia and its political classes will have much to answer for .

Passing DT alarming milestones means "" PRP are in a NN of planetary emergency "" WDT MD see humanity wiped from DT NN . So much damage has been done in DT nine outlined areas IN DT effects of JJ NN MD accelerate and create a deadly domino effect , researchers wrote in DT journal Nature . Points of no return picked out by DT team include DT loss of DT Amazon rainforest and DT great NN sheets of Antarctica and Greenland – damage from which our NN MD never recover . "" A decade ago PRP identified a suite of potential tipping points in DT NNP system , "" VBD lead author Professor Tim Lenton , from DT University of Exeter . "" Now PRP see evidence IN over half of them have been activated . "" DT team , made up of top researchers from DT UK , Germany , Denmark and Australia , VBD urgent action was needed to reduce NNS before further milestones are passed . "" DT growing threat of rapid , irreversible changes means PRP is no longer responsible to wait and see , "" Professor Lenton VBD . "" DT situation is urgent and PRP need an emergency response . "" A tipping point is reached when certain impacts of JJ NN become unstoppable , such as heavy NN loss in Antarctica . Among DT nine tipping points outlined by NNS were thawing of permafrost in Russia , large - scale die - offs of coral and a slowdown of ocean currents in DT Atlantic . Droughts in DT Amazon rainforest and fires in DT far north of Canada and Russia were RB VBN to be key crossroads identified a decade ago WDT are now "" active "" . Due to DT way our NN 's ecosystem is connected , as each tipping point is reached , others not currently active are pushed closer to DT brink . "" PRP is not only human pressures on NNP WDT continue rising to unprecedented levels , "" VBD NN coauthor Professor Johan Rockström , of DT Potsdam Institute in Germany . "" As NN advances , PRP must admit IN PRP have underestimated DT risks of unleashing irreversible changes , where DT NN self - amplifies JJ NN . "" This cascade of changes sparked by JJ NN MD threaten DT existence of human civilisations , according to DT researchers . DT collapse of major NN sheets on Greenland and Antarctica alone MD drive NN levels up by 10 metres , turfing millions in coastal areas from their homes . Changes to Atlantic currents have already triggered more frequent and destructive hurricanes across DT western NN . In DT past , PRP was thought IN DT NN MD need to heat up by 5C for NNP 's tipping points to be reached . However , evidence shows PRP have already started to hit them between 1C and 2C . NNP has heated by around 1C since pre-industrial temperatures , a figure WDT is certain to rise in DT coming decades . "" Scientifically , this provides strong evidence for declaring a NN of planetary emergency , "" Professor Rockström added . "" PRP must unleash NN action WDT accelerates DT path towards a NN WDT can continue evolving on a stable NN . "" Nearly 200 NNS signed DT 2015 Paris Agreement , pledging to keep JJ NN below 2C . However , current national NNS pledges – even if PRP are met – MD lead to 3C of NN . Experts argued IN further international action was needed , as PRP MD slow DT impacts of NN NN , giving more NN for NNS to adapt . Professor Lenton added : "" PRP might already have crossed DT threshold for a cascade of inter-related tipping points . "" However , DT rate at which PRP progress , and therefore DT risk PRP pose , can be reduced by cutting our NNS . "" His team concluded in their paper : "" If damaging tipping cascades can occur and a JJ tipping cannot be ruled out , then this is an existential threat to civilisation . "" "" A saving grace is IN DT rate at which damage accumulates from tipping MD still be under our control to some extent . "" DT stability and resilience of our NN is in peril . International action – not just words – must reflect this . "" In other NN , shocking photos this week revealed how Swiss glaciers have nearly disappeared since DT 1800s . Seaside towns were recently urged by experts to "" move inland "" as NN NN meant a retreat was needed . And , this NN level "" doomsday "" simulator reveals whether your home MD be wiped out by rising oceans . Are PRP worried about NN NN ? Let PRP VB in DT comments ! PRP pay for your stories !

DT associated JJ NN and humidification , increases in DT severity and frequency of extreme NN events , extension of DT ranges of vector ‐borne diseases , and DT consequent social and JJ stresses and disruption will have major negative consequences on JJ aspects of NN care . NNS whose resilience to NN is already impaired MD suffer disproportionately from these environmental changes , which are of unprecedented reach and magnitude . EX has been little connection made so far between NN NN and epilepsy . PRP briefly review DT history of NN NN NN and DT subsequent response of DT JJ scientific community . PRP consider how NN NN effects might in general affect NN and NN . PRP consider some of DT underlying complex interactions WDT , for example , favor DT spread of vector ‐borne diseases and how NN models operate and MD help plan for JJ and local changes . PRP then speculate specifically on how these generic ideas MD apply specifically to epilepsy . PRP consider these impacts at levels from molecular to DT epidemiological . Data are sparse , and EX is undoubtedly a need for more information to enable better estimation of possible effects of NN NN on care in epilepsy . PRP RB consider how DT professional activities of those involved in epilepsy NN care might contribute to JJ carbon NNS , for example , through flying for conference attendance . Healthcare organizations across DT NN are already considering , and responding to , JJ of these issues . PRP argue for more research in this area , but RB for action today . Actions today are likely to generate cobenefits for NN care , including care in epilepsy , resulting from efforts to decarbonize , mitigate effects of NN NN WDT has already happened , and plan for adaptation to NN NN . NN NN , dominated by NN NN , is accepted by DT majority of informed authorities as a clear feature of DT Anthropocene era , and is becoming DT lived experience shared by JJ of PRP globally , as PRP comment with increasing frequency about DT unseasonal weather and DT environment transforming around PRP . DT effects of NN NN will be pervasive , with no sphere of human endeavor likely to be untouched . As DT 5th assessment report from DT Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) VBZ : “ Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further NN and long ‐lasting changes in all components of DT NN system , increasing DT likelihood of severe , pervasive and irreversible impacts for NNS and ecosystems . Limiting NN NN MD require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas NNS which , together with adaptation , can limit NN NN risks . ” 1 DT risks to human NN posed by NN NN have already received extensive attention . DT fourth edition , published in 2018 , of DT Lancet Countdown on NN and NN NN stated NN NN was “ DT biggest JJ NN threat of DT 21st century , ” warning IN failure to take action MD lead to disasters WDT “ disrupt core JJ NN infrastructure and overwhelm NN services . ” 2 A further Lancet commission report details DT interaction between significant healthcare challenges ( a “ syndemic ” ) , working as multipliers WDT exacerbate unitary JJ challenges , such as obesity , undernutrition , and NN NN . 3 Several authorities and organizations have launched programs around DT effects of NN NN . DT NNP NNP and NNP Alliance , formed in 2011 , “ works to tackle NN NN and to protect and promote JJ NN ” and provides useful links and resources ( http://climateandhealthalliance.org/). Several international groups , nations , and regions have their own healthcare initiatives focused on NN NN , such as DT NNP Society Consortium on NNP and NNP in DT NNP NNPS ( https://medsocietiesforclimatehealth.org/), DT UK NNP Alliance on NNP NNP ( http://www.ukhealthalliance.org/), Doctors for DT Environment Australia ( https://www.dea.org.au/), DT Regional Institute of NNP Medicine and Research ( Rajasthan , India ) ( http://www.rihmr.org/), DT European Environment and NNP Youth Coalition ( http://www.eehyc.org/), and DT UK NHS ( https://www.sduhealth.org.uk/policy-strategy/reporting/nhs-carbon-footprint.aspx), carbon NNS from which are estimated to account for between 4 % and 6 % of DT total UK carbon footprint . DT NNP NNP Organization has made clear DT NN benefits of mitigating NN NN far outweigh DT costs . 4 DT NNP healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente announced in 2018 IN PRP MD become carbon neutral by 2020.5 Funders are increasingly supporting research into DT NN effects of NN NN , typically with a focus on mitigation strategies . PRP seems unlikely IN any human NN area will escape DT pervasive anticipated and unforeseen consequences of NN NN . Noting IN DT epilepsies are strongly influenced by environmental factors , PRP wished to start to consider how NN NN might affect DT epilepsies , to raise awareness within DT epilepsy community of these issues , and to facilitate and promote efforts by NNS affected by epilepsy , families and carers , and epilepsy professionals , to begin to address what action PRP can take . Individuals MD already be taking steps in their own private lives , for example , by working out their own carbon footprint ( https://footprint.wwf.org.uk/#/ ‐ a very easy to use and enlightening tool ) and taking effective actions . 6 Patients , clinicians , and NNS across DT NN , as a community , MD have ideas and initiatives for shared observations and mitigation measures to reduce DT potential added burden of NN NN for those with epilepsy . PRP here consider DT history of NN NN , review DT current NN of NN and JJ efforts to tackle NN NN , describe how NN NN can affect human NN and NN , and then address DT particular impacts RB MD be on DT epilepsies , how NN care in DT epilepsies might contribute to NN NN , what can be done to mitigate DT effects , and how progress might be achieved . 2 NN NN : A BRIEF SURVEY OF DT HISTORY AND CURRENT STATUS NN NN NN has a much longer history than most NNS realize , dating back to DT 19th century when Joseph Fourier recognized IN DT NNP 's atmosphere kept DT NN warmer than MD be DT case in a vacuum . He effectively discovered DT greenhouse effect : DT passage of visible light waves through DT atmosphere to DT NN 's surface , their absorption , and re‐emission as infrared radiation , which can then be absorbed by certain types of gases in DT atmosphere , increasing surface temperatures . Eunice Newton Foote was DT first to suggest IN DT NN effect of DT sun MD be increased in DT presence of carbon dioxide ( CO : then called “ carbonic acid ” ) . Her work was presented by Professor Joseph Henry at DT American Association for DT Advancement of NNP meeting in August 1856 . John Tyndall then examined DT absorption of infrared radiation in different gases , discovering DT greenhouse gases ( GHG ) CO , methane , and NN vapor in 1859 . Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius was DT first to link human activity to JJ NN . In 1896 , he published “ On DT Influence of Carbonic Acid in DT Air upon DT Temperature of DT NNP , ” calculating IN a doubling of atmospheric CO ( now called DT “ NN sensitivity ” ) MD give a total NN of 5 ‐6 °C . In later work , he revised this downward to 4°C.7 This is not dissimilar to DT range reported by DT IPCC ’s 5th Assessment Report from DT latest generation of JJ NN models . Events then jump almost 100 NNS to DT modern era when DT first conference on NN NN , a joint NNP Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) / NNP Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) / International Council for NNP ( ICSU ) Conference on DT "" Assessment of DT Role of Carbon Dioxide and Other Greenhouse Gases in NNP Variations and Associated Impacts , "" in 1985 concluded IN GHG "" are expected "" to cause significant NN in DT next century . This led to DT establishment of DT Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) in 1988 , whose role is to “ assess DT scientific , technical and socio‐economic information relevant for DT understanding of DT risk of human‐induced NN NN , ” and DT NNP Nations Framework Convention on NNP NNP ( UNFCCC ) , an international environmental treaty adopted on NNP 9 , 1992 . DT IPCC has issued a series of Assessment Reports once every 5 ‐6 NNS — published in 1990 ( First Assessment Report : FAR ) , 1995 ( Second Assessment Report : SAR ) , 2001 ( Third Assessment Report : TAR ) , 2007 ( Fourth Assessment Report : AR4 ) , and 2013 / 2014 ( Fifth Assessment Report : AR5 ) — and supplemental and special topic reports WDT describe DT NN of scientific understanding at DT NN each report is prepared . Although EX have now been five Assessment Reports ( and DT 6th is under construction ) , DT range of potential NN with a doubling of atmospheric CO has not changed substantially from DT estimate made with quite simple NN models in DT FAR , or indeed by Arrhenius in 1896 , with both DT FAR and AR5 suggesting a range from 1.5 to 4.5°C . Alongside this , DT UNFCCC objective is to "" stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in DT atmosphere at a level WDT MD prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with DT NN system . "" DT framework sets nonbinding limits on GHG NNS for individual NNS , with no enforcement mechanisms . An annual Conference of DT Parties ( COP ) assesses progress in dealing with NN NN , and these have occurred since 1995 , with JJ producing specific international treaties ( “ agreements ” or “ protocols ” ) around GHG NNS . This history includes ( a ) DT Kyoto protocol — a legally binding agreement WDT industrialized NNS will reduce their NNS of GHGs , adopted in 1997 in Kyoto , Japan ; ( b ) DT Copenhagen Accord ( 2009 ) , which recognized NN NN as CD of DT greatest challenges of DT present day and suggested actions should be taken to keep temperature increases to below 2 °C ; however , DT document was not legally binding and does not contain any binding commitments for reducing CO NNS ; ( c ) DT Durban Platform ( 2011 ) , which included a decision to adopt a legally binding treaty on NN NN ; DT treaty terms were to be set out by 2015 and become effective in 2020 and for DT first NN , PRP included developing NNS and DT NNP NNPS ; and ( d ) DT Paris Agreement ( 2015 ) was a NN NN accord agreed by ~200 NNS in December 2015 WDT came into force on November 4 , 2016 , committing NN leaders to keeping JJ NN below 2 °C and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5°C . Carbon emission curbs are not legally binding , but DT framework of DT accord , including a mechanism for periodically increasing pledges , is binding . Since DT FAR , DT understanding of human influence on NN has improved through better NN observations and NN system modeling , with DT AR5 stating IN : ( a ) “ NN of DT NN system is unequivocal , and since DT 1950s , JJ of DT observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia "" 8 ; ( b ) "" Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide , methane , and nitrous oxide have increased to levels unprecedented in at least DT last 800 000 NNS "" 8 ; and ( c ) “ Human influence on DT NN system is clear … PRP is extremely likely ( 95% ‐100 % probability ) IN human influence was DT dominant cause of JJ NN between 1951 ‐2010 . ” 8 Special reports such as DT recent SR159 ( JJ NN of 1.5 °C ) examined DT difference in impacts between 1.5 and 2 °C NN , suggesting IN limiting NN to 1.5 °C “ is possible within DT laws of chemistry and physics but doing so MD require unprecedented changes ” with “ ‘ rapid and far ‐reaching ’ transitions in land , NN , industry , buildings , transport , and cities . ” A 1.5 °C limit MD require JJ net anthropogenic CO NNS to decline by about 45 % from 2010 levels by 2030 , reaching net zero around 2050 . To limiting JJ NN to below 2°C , CO NNS will need to decline by about 20 % by 2030 and reach net zero around 2075 . PRP are already living in a 1 °C warmer NN . DT SR159 NNS “ PRP are already seeing DT consequences of 1 °C of JJ NN through more extreme weather , rising NN levels and diminishing Arctic NN NN , among other changes … By 2100 , JJ NN level rise MD be 10 cm lower with JJ NN of 1.5 °C compared with 2 °C , ” ; and moreover , “ JJ NN is likely to reach 1.5 °C between 2030 and 2052 if PRP continues to increase at DT current rate ( high confidence ) . ” If PRP continue on our current emission trajectory , then PRP are likely to reach 2.6‐4.8 °C NN by 2100 , with recent modeling results suggesting IN DT higher NN sensitivities MD be more likely . In terms of personal emission targets , average personal NNS in 2010 were around 5 tons per person and to reach DT 2 °C target MD require reduction to around 1.5 tons by 2050.10 This is very ambitious and of is of course based on an equal sharing of NNS across DT JJ population . In reality , DT rich , Westernized nations use much more carbon per person than DT poorer nations . 10 EX is DT potential for major reduction in personal carbon footprints in DT Western NN typically by reducing DT major contributors of car travel , heating , electricity use , and flying . Existing variability in weather influences human NN . For example , during clear summer days EX is an increased occurrence of sunburn and Lyme NN , while during DT winter , EX is increased influence of influenza and falls . As NN NN will influence weather , particularly weather extremes , then impacts on human NN are likely . Hence , EX has been an interest in DT likely influence of NN NN on human NN for over 30 NNS , with a significant body of work now available on DT NN impacts of NN NN . 11 - 15 NN NN MD lead to multiple NN impacts acting through a variety of different pathways , as shown conceptually in Figure 1 . Pathways through which NN NN MD influence NN . NN NN will affect mean weather , such as rainfall amounts and temperature . In addition to changing average conditions , PRP MD RB increase variability and extremes ( eg , more intense rainfall events ) . DT latter is probably of most consequence for human NN . Although globally , interannual temperature has not increased in variability , 16 EX is evidence of regional changes in extremes , 17,18 as both DT mean NN and NN variability shift in response to anthropogenic forcings ( Figure 2 ) . These shifts in weather will be moderated by local environmental conditions and human adaptation , leading to changes in three broad categories of exposure WDT have DT potential to influence NN . DT first are direct effects such as DT influence of a heatwave upon mortality . CD DT second are indirect exposures such as changing weather altering DT growing season and distribution of plants , affecting pollen production , which in turn impacts on allergic disease20 ; other examples include changing weather patterns affecting mosquito breeding and life cycles , leading to changes in malaria and dengue fever ( see below ) . 21 Changes in temperature and humidity alter DT geography of vector ‐borne diseases , by shifting vector breeding sites22 and altering DT transmission windows of vector ‐borne diseases . 23 In JJ NNS , more data are needed to characterize DT relationships between vector , pathogen , and NN . 24,25 Third , NN NN MD act through JJ and social disruption , for example , leading to mental NN effects from extreme events such as flooding26 or influencing JJ crop yields leading to increased hunger . 27 Flooding , whether coastal , fluvial , or pluvial , carries direct risks of drowning28 as well as a range of NN risks in DT aftermath of DT event , including DT spread of NN ‐borne diseases , 29 and DT spread of microbial contaminants in buildings . 30 DT risk of exacerbating existing JJ conditions , through disrupted access to medicines and JJ facilities , is RB a concern . Schematic showing DT effect on extreme temperatures when ( A ) DT mean temperature increases , ( B ) DT variance increases , and ( C ) when both DT mean and variance increase for a normal distribution of temperature However , changing exposure to extreme weather does not automatically lead to NN impacts , and DT gray box in Figure 1 highlights DT important moderating influence WDT NN care and wider JJ NN capability can have in ameliorating potential impacts . Put simply , appropriate NN care and JJ NN input can reduce NN impacts . PRP is important to recognize IN these capabilities are dynamic over NN . Furthermore , PRP can respond ( ie , adapt ) to JJ situations . CD prominent example of such an adaptation occurred in response to DT 2003 European heatwave during which over 70 000 additional deaths were recorded . CD City dwellers are at particular risk of heat stress given DT urban heat island effect . 31 Modeling suggests IN in summer 2003 , when an estimated 735 NNS died of causes relating to extreme heat in central Paris , anthropogenic NN NN increased DT risk of heat ‐related mortality by approximately 70%,32 illustrating DT scale of DT issue . In response , JJ European NNS developed early warning systems for heatwaves and national advice and guidelines on adaptation to reduce potential NN impacts . 33 Adapting JJ NN capabilities will play an important role in responding to NN NN . DT arrows in Figure 1 indicate feedback mechanisms between societal infrastructure , JJ NN , and adaptation measures and NN NN . Measures to reduce NN impacts MD RB reduce GHG NNS . Examples include DT NN and environmental cobenefits of low carbon diets . 34,35 Much of our understanding of likely impacts from NN NN in DT coming decades comes from NN models . Atmosphere ‐Ocean General Circulation Models ( AOGCMs ) 36 use DT laws of physics to compute atmospheric , oceanic , and other environmental variables , and represent different processes and interactions in DT NN system , at a series of evenly spaced “ cells ” or unit areas around DT globe . Although important tools in our understanding , PRP are complex and require considerable computational resource to run . For this reason , DT cells used by NN ‐of ‐the‐art JJ NN models typically span a large area in order to reduce DT number of calculations required : in turn , DT outputs generated are coarse . While these outputs are useful for identifying JJ and regional trends , PRP need to adapt them for local use ( eg , to assess DT likely impacts of NN NN in a particular coastal city or tropical community ) . This is accomplished using “ downscaling ” methods , 37,38 which involve using either statistical approaches or a higher resolution model over a limited area to add greater detail . 39,40 Unlike short‐term weather forecasts , which are dependent on DT initial NN of DT atmosphere , longer ‐term projections from NN models are largely dependent on trajectories of JJ development and on how fluctuating concentrations of GHGs impact DT balance of sunlight absorbed by DT NNP and NN radiated back into space . Thus , these longer ‐term projections are subject to substantial uncertainty not related to DT NN system . In DT most recent model simulations , these trajectories are characterized by DT representative concentration pathways ( RCPs ) , 41 a comprehensive dataset of changes to DT NNP 's NN balance under different possible futures . However , even when models are run with DT same RCP , intermodel variability arises due to differences in how models represent processes , leading to different projected future NN NNS . For this reason , a multimodel ensemble is often used , in which uncertainty is considered to be represented by DT spread of model projections . DT various choices and inferences made at each stage of DT modeling process can therefore yield a substantial envelope of uncertainty in local impacts . Yet , despite these uncertainties , consistent findings with relevance for epilepsy emerge . For instance , models agree exceptionally well on estimates of heat stress metrics , which combine temperature and humidity . 42 Furthermore , each generation of models represents an advance in our understanding of NN processes and a refinement of modeled processes . For example , for a number of extreme temperature indices , DT spread among DT most recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models ( CMIP5 ; CMIP is a collaborative framework for supporting assessments of NN NN and fostering model development , in which international modeling groups perform simulations based on preagreed scientific objectives , generating a database of model outputs with common standards ) is less than DT spread among DT previous generation CMIP3 models , even though DT project now contains more models . 43 DT burden of JJ of these changes will be felt by those least equipped to adapt . Models project increases in temperature variability in Amazonia , Southern Africa , DT Sahel , India , and South ‐East Asia over DT coming decades . 44 In India , models RB indicate an intensification of heatwaves , with areas WDT do not currently experience heatwaves becoming severely affected this century . 45 Thus , models can help PRP understand where PRP can expect DT effects of NN NN to be most marked and what those effects might be , in turn helping PRP plan for DT likely challenges WDT will need to be addressed for NN care in general , and epilepsy in particular . As DT NN changes , PRP can expect EX to be particular implications for epilepsy . These impacts might manifest at DT level of altered risk of epilepsy per se , altered risk of seizures in established epilepsy , consequences for epilepsy treatments , and outcomes , with effects more likely to affect those not favored in DT first place by geography and economics . PRP can expect inequalities in epilepsy NN care to be further exacerbated . NN NN leads to spread of vectors for infections , which is already being reported , and more can be anticipated . NN ‐driven hyperthermia , fevers , food and NN stress , and starvation MD further compound other difficulties as well as being directly relevant themselves . Moreover , while humans are remarkably adaptable and have found niches in almost every terrestrial environment , NN NN will superimpose unprecedented rates and types of NN . A number of vector ‐borne infections can cause epilepsy or seizures in DT acute phase . Chikungunya NN infection is associated with seizures as part of a multisystem acute illness in 10 % of patients , 46 while EX are case reports of epilepsy as part of DT chronic sequelae of neonatal chikungunya encephalitis .47 Epilepsia partialis continua has been reported with dengue encephalitis.48 Vertical Zika NN infection can lead to epilepsy even in DT absence of microcephaly , 49 and DT epilepsy is typically drug‐resistant . 50 If NN NN leads to a spread of DT vector carrying DT infectious agent , then EX will be an accompanying risk of spread of infection ‐related epilepsy or acute seizures . Predictions are difficult , because DT impact of NN NN on vectors is multifactorial , and MD be further compounded by multiplier effects as well as actions taking to mitigate its effects . PRP is already DT case IN DT NN ‐sensitive diseases affect DT poorest populations DT most , with higher prevalence and greater mortality , for several reasons . 51 Outbreaks of vector ‐borne infections can easily overwhelm healthcare systems , for example , as shown by recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika viruses , and emergence of infections in naïve populations or those WDT have lost immunity can be even more dangerous . JJ factors related to NN NN can alter vector ranges , survival , biting behavior , pathogen infection capacity , and thus ultimately DT risk of NN in humans . Changes in rainfall patterns , drought‐rain cycles , and flood magnitude and frequency can all have effects , while human strategies to combat NN NN , such as reestablishment of wetlands and green spaces , can , perversely , promote vector spread . Accounting for these effects in model simulations is particularly challenging , but preliminary studies suggest , for example , IN NN NN will favor DT spread of dengue fever and other arthropod ‐borne infections given DT temperature sensitivity of JJ factors favoring DT spread of infection . 52 Environmental , especially urban , effects of NN NN might lead to DT spread of cysticercosis,53 neurological involvement from which is a major cause of epilepsy globally . A NN focusing on DT risk of spread of vector ‐borne NN in DT UK resulting from NN NN suggests IN a 1 °C rise in temperature MD permit Chikungunya NN transmission for 1‐3 months of DT NN across most of southeast England by 2071 ‐2100 , with changes in transmission ranges RB found for a range of other arthropods . 52 Malaria is caused by five species of Plasmodium transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes . In malaria‐endemic areas , up to 90 % of DT population MD have parasites detectable in their blood . Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are associated with seizures and epilepsy , 54 particularly seizures during acute infections , and development of epilepsy has been documented following severe falciparum malaria . In addition , EX is evidence IN asymptomatic malaria parasitemia can precipitate seizures in those with epilepsy . 55 EX are JJ models of DT effect of NN NN on DT transmission of malaria , with DT most significant and consistent effects predicted to occur in DT highlands in Africa and parts of South America and South ‐East Asia .56 In other regions , DT effect of NN NN on malaria transmission MD be minimal due to improved control measures and socioeconomic factors , although DT present decline in malaria transmission across DT NN depends on continued support for DT current control measures . However , significant uncertainties exist in these models , particularly in DT areas WDT experience malaria epidemics . Furthermore , most of these models examined DT effect of NN NN on mosquitoes WDT carry P falciparum , but PRP is DT Anopheles species WDT transmit P vivax ( particularly Anopheles atroparvus ) WDT are most likely to increase seizures and epilepsy in Europe . 57 For example , in CD model , a medium ‐high scenario of NN NN predicts IN DT southern half of Great Britain will be climatically suitable for P vivax malaria transmission by 2030 and by 2080 even southern Scotland will be climatically suitable for 2 months of DT NN . 58 Phenomena other than infections are RB worsening with NN NN . As conflicts arise , PRP can expect more head injuries as another cause of epilepsy . A NN from a highly polluted city in NNP suggests IN transient increases in air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide are associated with increased hospital visits for epilepsy , supporting findings from another NN from Chile WDT reported an increased risk of hospitalization for epilepsy with increases in air pollutants . 59 Another NN identified a tentative link between higher relative air humidity and an increased risk of admission for an epileptic seizure ( though higher ambient temperature was associated with a lower risk ) . 60 These are preliminary studies WDT suggest DT relationships , if correct , are complex with a need for more data . But , EX is certainly a prevailing view IN DT outlook strongly favors strategies to forestall NN NN rather than trying to deal with DT consequences on epilepsy and seizures of DT complicated environmental changes WDT will occur due to NN NN . Temperature can affect genes and proteins . Most genetic epilepsies are due to dysfunctional channels . As in much of epilepsy genetics , SCN1A is among DT best studied in this regard . Some mutations in SCN1A WDT can cause epilepsy lead to defective folding of DT encoded channel : Mutant channel insertion into a cell surface is temperature ‐sensitive , for example , with increased insertion and current density at 30 °C compared to 37°C.61 Mutations in SCN1A can cause DT rare , severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy Dravet syndrome . While DT effect of such dynamic changes in DT context of prolonged periods of higher ambient temperature in thermoregulating humans is difficult to predict , empirical and modeling data show direct effects of higher temperatures on sodium channel biophysical properties and neuronal dynamics . 62 Elevated ambient temperatures due to hot baths increase seizure frequency in Dravet syndrome . 63 Anecdotally , DT UK Dravet syndrome patient support group reported IN during DT sustained atypical high ambient temperatures of DT summer of 2018 , affected NNS experienced more seizures and greater lethargy , in keeping with survey data from DT Netherlands . 64 PRP previously reported DT death of a young patient with Dravet syndrome who had been seizure ‐free , but had been walking outside on DT hottest day in Melbourne ( Australia ) for NNS , with a peak of 46.5°C.65 EX are other temperature ‐sensitive epilepsies , though generally less well studied . An epilepsy ‐related mutation in SCN8A was associated with temperature ‐sensitive protein expression and function . 66 Other genetic epilepsies with fever ‐induced seizures include those due to certain mutations in DT genes GABRG2 , CHD2 , STX1B : Temperature elevation can affect brain thermal regulation and epileptiform discharges and induce seizures in models carrying certain mutations in GABRG2 67 or STX1B .68 Moreover , seizures in JJ epilepsies , of all types , are more frequent with psychological stress . NN NN is projected to increase population stress levels as PRP will affect mean NN , such as rainfall amounts and temperature , but RB weather variability and extremes , probably of most consequence for human NN . EX has been little research into DT effects of NN NN on treatments for epilepsy . Lorazepam , used in JJ parts of DT NN as an emergency treatment for seizures , is especially prone to degradation with higher mean kinetic temperature . 69 EX are few data on other antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs ) , and DT summary of product characteristics for several commonly used AEDs do not include specific temperature recommendations , while , for example , phenobarbital tablets should be stored below 25°C.70 Medication supply chains can be compromised even today : PRP is easy to see how disruption to infrastructure MD threaten AED ( and indeed any drug ) supply , as indeed happened after an exemplar ( but not NN NN ‐related ) disruption in a highly organized , well ‐developed economy in DT Great East Japan earthquake of 2011.71 In addition , biodiversity loss is a feature of NN NN : This MD compromise sources , such as plant , microbial , and fungal species , from which DT next antiepileptic drugs might emerge ( see Figure 3 ) . Example of a zebrafish behavioral assay showing anticonvulsant activity of a plant extract typically used for ethnomedicinal purposes to treat seizures in Cameroon . Zebrafish larvae were pretreated with DT ethanolic plant extract ( 25 µg / mL ) for 18 h before acute exposure to pentylenetetrazol ( 20 mmol / L ) . Pentylenetetrazol ‐induced convulsive ‐like behavior was measured 5 min after , using an automated video‐tracking device . Graph shows total distance traveled by larvae in millimeters per 5 ‐min interval during a 30 ‐min tracking session . Data were analyzed using specialized software to quantify total larval movements and subjected to two ‐way with repeated ‐measures ANOVA , followed by Bonferroni 's post hoc test ( n = 10 ‐ 12/ group ) . *** P <.001 , *P <.05 ( vs Veh + veh ) , ###P <.001 , # P <.05 ( vs Veh + PTZ ) . EXT , extract ; PTZ , pentylenetetrazol ; Veh , vehicle . Note : Total distance traveled by PTZ ‐treated larvae is lower at later NN intervals as larvae reach DT equivalent of status epilepticus at this stage and are less able to move due to loss of posture — therefore accounting for lack of statistical significance between extract ‐treated larvae Moreover , poverty is associated with reduced access to NN care , with DT majority of NNS in DT NN today with epilepsy having no access to any AEDs . Most NN NN projections anticipate IN poverty is likely to increase , with disproportionate effects for those already most vulnerable . Thus , PRP can anticipate IN DT negative influence of epilepsy on socioeconomic status and all ‐cause risk of premature mortality will grow with NN NN independent of any direct effect on epilepsy biology . 7 WHAT CAN THOSE INVOLVED IN EPILEPSY DO ? Measures to address NN NN MD include attempts to reduce carbon NNS , and actions for mitigation and adaptation . 1 For epilepsy professionals , EX MD be steps WDT be included in daily practice . Raising awareness of NN NN , its impact for NNS with epilepsy and our contributions to NN NN is a start — DT very purpose of this article . Concurrently , more research is required to investigate into NN NN and epilepsy , to better define DT risks and develop adaptations and mitigations . Reduction of carbon NNS ( “ decarbonizing ” ) MD begin with understanding DT sources of carbon NNS at DT individual level and monitoring of individual carbon contributions , for both professionals and NNS with epilepsy . Personal and SME carbon NNS calculators are available online ( examples include : https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx; https://footprint.wwf.org.uk/#/; https://www.carbontrust.com/resources/tools/carbon-footprint-calculator/). Among DT key contributors for most NNS as professionals will be travel , consumption of food and goods , NN equipment , hotels , and restaurants , but this is not an exhaustive list and PRP invite other suggestions . Travel is likely to be a major contributor for JJ professionals and patients . Flying to conferences and meetings is likely to be an important component of contributions to NNS at DT personal professional level . Flying in classes other than economy increases NNS significantly , for several reasons ( eg , see http://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/blog-carbon-footprint-world-bank-group-staff-air-travel). Various websites , including some for academic travel in particular , can help NNS calculate , reduce , or mitigate NNS ( eg , www.flyingless.org and https://thepointsguy.com/guide/a-guide-to-airline-carbonoffset-programs/). This is a difficult area , as clinical and scientific advances and stronger collaborations do emerge from face ‐to ‐face meetings , and teleconferencing still lacks both DT personal touch and infallible reliability . But perhaps not every meeting is essential,65 and to achieve DT carbon emission reductions necessary to stabilize DT NN will require PRP to modify some current practices and find JJ ways to achieve DT same outcomes . Targeted distribution of mitigation measures ( eg , carbon offsetting ) for conference attendance to those nations most at risk from NN NN MD suit some conference attendees . Higher levels of sustainability at conferences should be considered : hotel usage , maintenance of ambient temperatures in conference halls and hotels ( and personal offices at work ) , and food and drink provision at meetings are all areas to be considered . JJ organizations will consider these difficult changes to make for meetings WDT often represent sources of income , but as with JJ aspects of NN NN , EX is a bigger picture to consider . NN NNS themselves have considered and addressed DT issue of conference travel ( https://noflyclimatesci.org/), even with a model for a “ nearly carbon ‐neutral conference . ” 74 More flying does not necessarily equate with greater academic success .75 Car journeys represent another area in which professionals and patients might both contribute , and actions such as telehealth initiatives MD be possible in some settings and jurisdictions , though information technology infrastructure , privacy , and regulatory issues MD present difficulties . Professionals can form powerful lobby groups and bring these issues to DT attention of their organizations . PRP must not be nihilistic . Actions at governmental , institutional , and personal levels are required and possible . For example , DT UK NNP Alliance on NNP NNP ( http://www.ukhealthalliance.org/) advocates “ for responses to NN NN WDT protect and promote JJ NN . ” Online tools are available for further ideas and implementation of adaptation measures ( eg , https://www.ukcip.org.uk/). Adaptations will be necessary and will need to be shaped by outcomes from research ( ideally shared across diseases ) , such as improved awareness and management of changes in vector ranges or medicine manufacture and distribution practice . Nondomestic contributions to NN NN exceed those of DT residential sector . Companies and institutions around DT NN are beginning to take action : DT behavior of employees , including epilepsy professionals , MD be overlooked in this process , but can be central to DT initiation , promotion , and success of programs designed to address NN NN . Asking employees to switch their computers off at DT end of DT day , for example , does not mean NNS will do DT . Professionals can , however , choose to take DT lead . Evidence shows IN NNS can be motivated as much by “ cobenefits ” ( such as JJ and scientific advancement ; or fostering a more moral and caring community ) as PRP are by concern about NN NN , whether PRP are convinced about DT occurrence of NN NN or not .76 Adaptations might include , for example , increased vigilance and preemptive changes in behavior against local extreme heat events for NNS with epilepsy due to heat ‐sensitive mutation ‐driven genetic epilepsies , informed by local ( downscaled ) modeling of future NN trends , or improved short‐term weather forecasting . As precision medicine initiatives become more popular , PRP MD envisage inclusion of NN NN parameters in individualized epilepsy management schemes . PRP summarize some suggestions for actions in Table 2 . Actions to consider regarding epilepsy and NN NN Increase information available on impact on NN NN on epilepsy and vice versa Collect data from NNS with epilepsy , own clinical practice Establish contact with local and national patient and carer support organizations ; gather data systematically Establish links with local NN NNS , consider local and regional factors ( eg , urban vs rural ) Changing patterns of seizures and comorbidities reported by NNS with epilepsy ; use of social NN and big data methods Included temperature and humidity parameters in experimental models ; quantification of stress and consequences in clinical trials ; stability of medications Join local , national , international initiatives for individuals and professionals ; calculate own carbon NNS at personal and professional levels Develop practice approaches WDT are more sustainable Consider changes with cobenefits to raise chances of engagement and success Consider travel options ; use freely available tools ; explore and engage with local NN service sustainability efforts ; lobby institutions , healthcare organizations , journals and conference organizers Consider measures WDT facilitate sustainable behavior — for example , earlier setting up of conferences to enable planning of more sustainable travel options Provide information and advice — for example , when heatwaves are expected ; promote telehealth where possible Switch off devices when not needed ; promote sustainable practices — for example , enable colleagues to attend meetings remotely , record talks for dissemination Promote sustainability for DT next generation Facilitate remote supervision and mentoring ; reduce dependence of academic progress upon less sustainable practices Clinicians have always considered prevention to be better than cure . Minimizing DT progress of NN NN and mitigating NNS now will be cheaper than taking actions later when DT situation has already gotten worse , although EX is already a need for some adaptation due to NN from historical NNS . DT challenge is huge , but PRP is incumbent upon PRP to do what PRP can : This is intrinsic to our commitment and duty to patient care and can be seen as part of DT aim of achieving JJ equality of NN care in epilepsy . NNS have managed huge challenges before — DT reduction in drink driving rates , DT reduced production of aerosols , and changes in behavior after DT HIV epidemic . With NN NN , DT challenge is bigger , more JJ , and more urgent , but everything counts . Schools , towns , local councils , and nations have declared NNS of “ NN emergency ” ( eg , https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48126677), with a prominent role played by schoolchildren . Should and can a profession take action beyond virtue signaling ? And if so , what additional evidence do PRP need to do DT ? Or in fact can PRP not afford to wait ? PRP acknowledge DT links between epilepsy and NN NN PRP discuss are speculative , and more research is required . And , of course , anything PRP can do in our personal lives anyway can contribute to help counter CD of DT biggest challenges facing humanity and all life on this NN . PRP should perhaps finish with DT words of DT next generation , specifically Greta Thunberg ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta aged 16 , speaking to members of DT European Parliament and European Union officials in Strasbourg on April 16 , 2019 , after DT disastrous fire at Notre Dame cathedral : “ PRP is still not too late to act . PRP will take a far ‐reaching vision , PRP will take courage , PRP will take fierce , fierce determination to act now , to lay DT foundations where PRP MD not VB all DT details about how to shape DT ceiling . In other words , PRP will take cathedral thinking . I ask PRP to please wake up and make changes required possible . ”"

DT warning comes almost a NN after DT Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) concluded in a landmark report IN PRP only have until 2030 to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and prevent DT NN from reaching DT crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels . DT second IPCC report highlights DT vicious cycle of NN NN and land degradation . "" PRP humans affect more than 70 % of NN - free land , a quarter of this land is degraded . DT way PRP produce food and what PRP eat contributes to DT loss of natural ecosystems and declining biodiversity , "" VBD Valérie Masson - Delmotte , co-chair of DT IPCC . Deforestation and agriculture RB fuel JJ NN , by weakening land 's capacity to draw down carbon dioxide from DT atmosphere and emitting vast amounts of greenhouse gases . "" When land is degraded , PRP reduces DT soils ability to take up carbon and this exacerbates NN NN . In turn , NN NN exacerbates land degradation in JJ different ways . Today 500 million NNS live in areas WDT experience desertification , "" Masson - Delmotte VBD . But DT report does offer hope , EX are major opportunities to reverse DT damage , DT IPCC notes . Here are five key takeaways from DT IPCC report : Land DT size of South America has been degraded Human use takes up over 70 % of DT NN 's NN - free land surface , according to DT IPCC report . PRP degrade DT NN 's natural resources , with chemical fertilizers , deforestation and intensive farming . In DT process , humans have damaged two billion hectares of land , DT size of South America . As a result , this land is less fertile and captures smaller quantities of carbon NNS from DT atmosphere , according to Stephen Cornelius , DT NNP Wildlife Fund 's ( WWF ) chief advisor on NN NN . "" DT way PRP use land is driving DT NN crisis , "" he told CNN . "" Ecosystem conversion releases greenhouse gas NNS . Land use , including agriculture and deforestation , produces almost a quarter of DT NN 's greenhouse gas NNS . PRP need to stop wasting food and eat less meat DT IPCC report stresses IN food waste and meat consumption will need to be reduced if PRP VBP to slash JJ NNS . Both are big contributors to JJ NN -- with food waste producing between 8 - 10 % and livestock 14.5 % of JJ NNS , according to WWF . According to DT report , 25 - 30 % of all food produced is never eaten , while 821 million worldwide are undernourished . If food waste was a country , PRP MD be DT third largest emitter after DT NNP and NNP , according to DT Waste and Resources Action Programme ( WRAP ) , a non-profit working to reduce JJ waste . "" DT fact IN more than CD billion tonnes of food never gets consumed while CD in nine NNS VBP to bed hungry is a travesty , "" VBD Claire Kneller , head of food at WRAP . If DT NNP Nations goal of halving food waste by 2030 is to be met , NNS should start measuring waste and adopt their own reduction goal , according to Kneller . "" PRP will not tackle DT impact of NN NN if PRP do not fix our JJ food system , "" she VBD . PRP need to restore natural carbon sinks Forests and wetlands are important carbon sinks , but have been greatly diminished by human activities , DT IPCC warns , and their ability to capture carbon MD continue to decrease depending on human actions . Between 2007 - 2016 , land removed 29 % of total CO2 NNS from DT atmosphere . Peatlands -- a type of wetlands -- can hold carbon for centuries , but more intense droughts , floods and wildfires MD trigger DT release of carbon from DT soil . Sustainable soil management and agroforestry are key solutions WDT "" deliver carbon sequestration in soil or vegetation , "" DT report notes . Land restoration "" represents a fantastic opportunity to draw down carbon from DT atmosphere , "" Cornelius VBD . "" DT food system is both a leading cause and a casualty of NN NN , "" according to Joao Campari , who leads WWF 's JJ food practice . NN NN increases DT frequency and intensity of extreme weather events , such as droughts and floods , which destroy crops and critical farming infrastructure . PRP 's not just extreme weather WDT is threatening farming -- NN NN is RB changing what types of crops can grow in certain locations by making PRP too hot or too dry . Campari told CNN DT food system must "" urgently "" be reformed to avoid catastrophic JJ NN . Food production uses 34 % of land worldwide and contributes up to 75 % of deforestation , he VBD . To stave off DT worst effects of NN NN , humans need to stop converting land and destroying DT soil with fertilizers and by cutting down trees , VBD Campari , adding IN PRP already have enough farmland to feed DT JJ population . Bioenergy is not DT answer In its report last NN , DT IPCC warned IN keeping JJ temperatures at 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels MD require removing carbon dioxide from DT atmosphere , using techniques such as Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage ( BECCS ) . But in its latest report , DT IPCC VBD IN quickly rolling out this technology on a large scale "" MD greatly increase demand for land conversion . "" Ramping up bioenergy production through DT use of fertilizers and irrigation MD erode soil , increase NN scarcity and threaten food security , DT report notes . Claudia Ringler , deputy director at DT International Food Policy Research Institute ( IFPRI ) , told CNN IN biofuels are not a scalable solution . DT NN MD have to convert 7.2 million square kilometers , 45 % of DT NNP 's cropland , into bioenergy crops to keep JJ temperatures at 1.5 °C , according to DT most NN - intensive scenario outlined in DT 2018 IPCC report . "" PRP 's not possible , not at DT rate PRP are proposing , "" Ringler VBD , explaining IN DT conversion of this much land MD lead to a huge spike in JJ food prices and drive insecurity ."

But on Wednesday attention was focused across DT Atlantic , where in Monaco DT UN ’s Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP presented a special report on DT “ unprecedented ” impact NN temperature will have on DT NN ’s oceans . PRP ’s not good . DT report — compiled by over 100 authors from 36 NNS citing close to 7,000 accredited sources — paints a grim picture of DT effect NN oceans and DT cryosphere will have on humanity , especially if nothing is done to curb NNS . DT ocean has played a critical role in warding off DT effects of NN NN by absorbing close to 25 percent of CO2 NNS . DT report warns IN as DT temperature continues to rise and DT ocean traps more heat , PRP will become more acidic , less oxygenated , less productive , less hospitable to life , and more likely to give rise to tropical storms and hurricanes , which will occur with greater frequency and intensity . DT report notes IN with any additional degree of NN , intense NN events WDT used to occur once per century will in certain regions once per NN by DT middle of DT 21st century . Connected to DT fate of DT NN ’s oceans is DT fate of DT NN ’s frozen areas , or DT cryosphere , on which close to 1.5 billion NNS ’s lives directs depend . As parts of DT cryosphere melt ( glaciers , for instance ) , DT JJ NN level will continue to rise , dramatically altering life for those living in coast regions , if not making those regions uninhabitable . DT NN level is rising twice as fast as PRP did during DT 20th century , and IN DT rate is increasing , DT report notes , explaining IN DT Antarctic NN sheet will contribute more to NN level rise by 2100 than was previously expected . In DT next 80 NNS , DT NN level MD increased by up to 60 centimeters if greenhouse gas NNS are dramatically reduced , and 110 centimeters if PRP are not . PRP is n’t just glaciers and rising NN levels , either . As permafrost , snow , and NN melt , DT frequency of landslides , avalanches , rockfalls , floods , and wildfires will increase . NN availability MD RB be thrown into flux as glaciers retreat , impacting agriculture . “ DT NN ’s ocean and cryosphere have been ‘ taking DT heat ’ from NN NN for decades , and consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe , ” IPCC Vice Chair Ko Barett VBD in a statement . “ DT rapid changes to DT ocean and DT frozen parts of our NN are forcing NNS from coastal cities to remote Arctic communities to fundamentally alter their ways of life . ” In August , DT IPCC released a similarly dire report about DT impact DT NN crisis will have on DT JJ food supply . This extends well beyond traditional agriculture . DT report released Wednesday explains IN DT “ JJ catch potential ” for fish MD decrease as DT NN ocean becomes less hospitable to marine life , and IN communities WDT rely on seafood MD be in trouble . DT only answer is to cut CO2 NNS and work toward more sustainable solutions . “ Cutting greenhouse gas NNS will limit impacts on ocean ecosystems WDT provide PRP with food , support our NN and shape our cultures , ” IPCC Co-Chair Hans - Otto Pörtner , Co-Chair VBD in a statement . “ Reducing other pressures such as pollution will further help marine life deal with changes in their environment , while enabling a more resilient ocean . ” Despite DT realities detailed in DT report , PRP was structured around DT idea IN JJ of these consequences can be mitigated with “ timely , ambitious and coordinated action ” to reduce NNS and pursue sustainable development . Unfortunately for humanity , NNP and DT NNP NNPS , DT NN ’s two largest emitters of greenhouse gases , have largely ignored he NN crisis . Neither cared to contribute possible solutions at DT UN ’s NNP Summit this week ."

DT discovery made big NN and rattled DT NN . Aerosol sales dropped dramatically , and , despite pushback from DT chemical companies WDT made CFCs , Congress in 1977 added protecting DT ozone layer to DT Environmental Protection Agency ’s duties under DT Clean Air Act . Not long afterward , DT agency determined IN DT compounds , then widely used in refrigerators , air - conditioners and some industrial processes , posed an even graver threat to DT atmosphere than first thought . Soon after , pressure began to build for a phaseout of CFCs in DT NNP NNPS as well as for an international treaty to find alternatives . DT case for JJ action became ever more urgent in 1985 when a British team discovered a hole in DT ozone layer above Antarctica , followed by confirmation by NASA NNS of a connection between DT hole and CFCs . With DT rest of DT NN and even industry on board , DT result was DT 1987 Montreal Protocol , a landmark agreement banning chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone - depleting chemicals . End of story ? Not quite . As PRP happened , DT ozone - friendly replacements for DT CFCs , known as hydrofluorocarbons , turned out to be distinctly unfriendly to DT NN . So in 2016 , DT Montreal signatories reconvened in Kigali , Rwanda , and agreed to amend DT original protocol to phase out HFCs and find substitutes more friendly to DT atmosphere . DT bottom line is IN DT NN , confronted with two dire threats to DT NN ’s fragile atmosphere , found two planetary responses with positive outcomes . DT ozone layer is healing . DT ’s worth remembering as PRP struggle , often despairingly , to find common ground in DT battle against NN NN . Compared with DT manifold complexities of JJ NN , dealing with ozone depletion was , in fact , relatively simple . But DT key point is IN PRP happened , and PRP ’s worth asking why DT NN has not responded with similar resolve in dealing with DT main JJ NN gases IN carbon dioxide , about which PRP have known a lot for a long NN ."

In an interview with ABC NNP in Australia , Professor Wæver cautions IN what he sees as “ NN inaction ” might draw DT U.N. into considering other means to ensure its goals are met , even if DT leads to JJ armed conflict . Professor Wæver says more resistance to NN MD potentially threaten democracy although DT U.N. MD counter IN DT end justified DT means in much DT same way NNS IN Greece had their debt crisis solutions forced on them by European Union bureaucrats in Brussels and Strasbourg . “ DT NNP Nations Security Council MD , in principle , tomorrow decide IN NN NN is a threat to international peace and security , ” he says . “ And then PRP ’s within their competencies to decide ‘ and PRP are doing this , PRP are doing this , PRP are doing this , this is how PRP deal with PRP ’. ” He believes classifying NN NN as a security issue MD leave DT door open to more extreme policy responses . “ DT ’s what happens when something becomes a security issue , PRP gets DT urgency , DT intensity , DT priority , which is helpful sometimes , but PRP RB lets DT dark forces loose in DT sense IN PRP can justify problematic means , ” he says .

PRP took nearly a century of research and data to convince DT vast majority of DT scientific community IN human activity MD alter DT NN of our entire NN . In DT 1800s , experiments suggesting IN human - produced carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) and other gases MD collect in DT atmosphere and insulate NNP were met with more curiosity than concern . By DT late 1950s , CO2 readings MD offer some of DT first data to corroborate DT JJ NN theory . Eventually an abundance of data , along with NN modeling MD show not only IN JJ NN was real , but IN PRP RB presented a host of dire consequences . Dating back to DT ancient Greeks , JJ NNS had proposed IN humans MD VB temperatures and influence rainfall by chopping down trees , plowing fields or irrigating a desert . CD theory of NN effects , widely believed until DT Dust Bowl of DT 1930s , held IN “ rain follows DT plow , ” DT now - discredited idea IN tilling soil and other agricultural practices MD result in increased rainfall . Accurate or not , those perceived NN effects were merely local . DT idea IN humans MD somehow alter NN on a JJ scale MD seem far - fetched for centuries . In DT 1820s , French mathematician and physicist Joseph Fourier proposed IN NN reaching DT NN as sunlight must be balanced by NN returning to space since heated surfaces emit radiation . But some of DT NN , he reasoned , must be held within DT atmosphere and not return to space , keeping NNP warm . He proposed IN NNP ’s thin covering of air — its atmosphere — acts DT way a glass greenhouse MD . NN enters through DT glass walls , but is then trapped inside , much IN a warm greenhouse . Experts have since pointed out IN DT greenhouse analogy was an oversimplification , since outgoing infrared radiation is n’t exactly trapped by NNP ’s atmosphere but absorbed . DT more greenhouse gases EX are , DT more NN is kept within NNP ’s atmosphere . But DT so - called greenhouse effect analogy stuck and some 40 NNS later , Irish scientist John Tyndall MD start to explore exactly what kinds of gases were most likely to play a role in absorbing sunlight . Tyndall ’s laboratory tests in DT 1860s showed IN coal gas ( containing CO2 , methane and volatile hydrocarbons ) was especially effective at absorbing NN . He eventually demonstrated IN CO2 alone acted IN sponge in DT way PRP MD absorb multiple wavelengths of sunlight . By 1895 , Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius became curious about how decreasing levels of CO2 in DT atmosphere might cool NNP . In order to explain past NN ages , he wondered if a decrease in volcanic activity might lower JJ CO2 levels . His calculations showed IN if CO2 levels were halved , JJ temperatures MD decrease by about 5 degrees Celsius ( 9 degrees Fahrenheit ) . Next , Arrhenius wondered if DT reverse were true . Arrhenius returned to his calculations , this NN investigating what MD happen if CO2 levels were doubled . DT possibility seemed remote at DT NN , but his results suggested IN JJ temperatures MD increase by DT same amount — 5 degrees C or 9 degrees F . Decades later , modern NN modeling have confirmed IN Arrhenius ’ numbers were n’t far off DT mark . Back in DT 1890s , however , DT concept of VBG DT NN was remote and even welcomed . As Arrehenius wrote , “ By DT influence of DT increasing percentage of carbonic acid [ CO2 ] in DT atmosphere , PRP MD hope to enjoy ages with more equable and better climates , especially as regards DT colder regions of DT NN . ” By DT 1930s , at least CD scientist MD start to claim IN carbon NNS might already be having a NN effect . British engineer Guy Stewart Callendar noted IN DT NNP NNPS and North Atlantic region had warmed significantly on DT heels of DT Industrial Revolution . Callendar ’s calculations suggested IN a doubling of CO2 in NNP ’s atmosphere MD warm NNP by 2 degrees C ( 3.6 degrees F ) . He MD continue to argue into DT 1960s IN a greenhouse - effect NN of DT NN was underway . While Callendar ’s claims were largely met with skepticism , he managed to draw attention to DT possibility of JJ NN . DT attention played a part in garnering some of DT first NN - funded projects to more closely monitor NN and CO2 levels . Most famous among those research projects was a monitoring station established in 1958 by DT Scripps Institution of Oceanography on top of Hawaii ’s Mauna Loa Observatory . Scripps geochemist Charles Keeling was instrumental in outlining a way to record CO2 levels and in securing funding for DT observatory , which was positioned in DT center of DT Pacific Ocean . Data from DT observatory revealed what MD become known as DT “ Keeling Curve . ” DT upward , saw tooth - shaped curve showed a steady rise in CO2 levels , along with short , jagged up - and - down levels of DT gas produced by repeated wintering and greening of DT Northern Hemisphere . DT dawn of advanced computer modeling in DT 1960s began to predict possible outcomes of DT rise in CO2 levels made evident by DT Keeling Curve . Computer models consistently showed IN a doubling of CO2 MD produce a NN of 2 degrees C or 3.6 degrees F within DT next century . Still , DT models were preliminary and a century seemed a very long NN away . READ MORE : When NNP NNP Was Revealed by DT Keeling Curve In DT early 1970s , a different kind of NN worry took hold : JJ cooling . As more NNS became concerned about pollutants NNS were emitting into DT atmosphere , some NNS theorized DT pollution MD block sunlight and cool NNP . In fact , NNP did cool somewhat between 1940 - 1970 due to a postwar boom in aerosol pollutants which reflected sunlight away from DT NN . DT idea IN sunlight - blocking pollutants MD chill NNP caught on in DT NN , as in a 1974 NNP magazine article titled “ Another NNP Age ? ” But as DT brief cooling period ended and temperatures resumed their upward climb , warnings by a minority of NNS IN NNP was cooling were dropped . Part of DT reasoning was IN while smog MD remain suspended in DT air for weeks , CO2 MD persist in DT atmosphere for centuries . DT early 1980s MD mark a sharp increase in JJ temperatures . JJ experts point to 1988 as a critical turning point when watershed events placed JJ NN in DT spotlight . DT summer of 1988 was DT hottest on record ( although JJ since then have been hotter ) . 1988 RB saw widespread drought and wildfires within DT NNP NNPS . NNS sounding DT alarm about NN NN began to see NN and DT NN paying closer attention . NASA scientist James Hansen delivered testimony and presented models to congress in June of 1988 , saying he was “ 99 percent sure ” IN JJ NN was upon PRP . CD NN later , in 1989 , DT Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) was established under DT NNP Nations to provide a scientific view of NN NN and its political and JJ impacts . As JJ NN gained currency as a real phenomenon , researchers dug into possible ramifications of a VBG NN . Among DT predictions were warnings of severe heat waves , droughts and more powerful hurricanes fueled by rising NN surface temperatures . Other studies predicted IN as massive glaciers at DT poles melt , NN levels MD rise between 11 and 38 inches ( 28 to 98 centimeters ) by 2100 , enough to swamp JJ of DT cities along DT east coast of DT NNP NNPS . Kyoto Protocol : NNP NNPS In , Then Out NN leaders began discussions to try and stem DT outflow of greenhouse gas NNS to prevent DT most dire predicted outcomes . DT first JJ agreement to reduce greenhouse gases , DT Kyoto Protocol , was adopted in 1997 . DT protocol , which was signed by NNP Bill NNP , called for reducing DT emission of six greenhouse gases in 41 NNS plus DT European Union to 5.2 percent below 1990 levels during DT target period of 2008 to 2012 . In March 2001 , shortly after taking office , NNP George W. Bush announced DT NNP NNPS MD not implement DT Kyoto Protocol , saying DT protocol was “ fatally flawed in fundamental ways ” and citing concerns IN DT deal MD hurt DT U.S. economy . DT same NN , DT IPCC issued its third report on NN NN , saying IN JJ NN , unprecedented since DT end of DT last NN age , is “ very likely , ” with highly damaging future impacts . Five NNS later , in 2006 , former Vice NNP and presidential candidate Al Gore weighed in on DT dangers of JJ NN with DT debut of his film An Inconvenient Truth . Gore won DT 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for his work on behalf of NN NN . Politicization over NN NN , however , MD continue , with some skeptics arguing IN predictions presented by DT IPCC and publicized in NN IN Gore ’s film were overblown . Among those expressing skepticism over JJ NN was future U.S. NN Donald NNP . On November 6 , 2012 , NNP tweeted “ DT concept of JJ NN was created by and for DT Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive . ” Paris NNP Agreement : NNP NNPS In , Then Out DT NNP NNPS , under NNP Barack Obama , MD sign onto another milestone treaty on NN NN , DT Paris NNP Agreement , in 2015 . In DT agreement , 195 NNS pledged to set targets for their own greenhouse gas cuts and to report their progress . DT backbone of DT Paris NNP Agreement was a declaration to prevent a JJ temperature rise of 2 degrees C ( 3.6 degrees F ) . JJ experts considered 2 degrees C of NN to be a critical limit , which , if surpassed will lead to increasing risk of more deadly heat waves , droughts , storms and rising JJ NN levels . DT election of Donald NNP in 2016 led to DT NNP NNPS declaring PRP MD withdraw from DT Paris treaty . NNP NNP , citing DT “ onerous restrictions ” imposed by DT accord , stated IN he MD not “ in good conscience support a deal WDT punishes DT NNP NNPS . ” DT same NN , independent analyses by NASA and DT National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) found NNP ’s 2016 surface temperatures to be DT warmest since modern record keeping began in 1880 . And in October 2018 , DT U.N. 's Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP issued a report WDT concluded "" rapid , far - reaching "" actions are needed to cap JJ NN at 1.5 Celsius ( 2.7 Fahrenheit ) and avert DT most dire , irreversible consequences for DT NN . In August 2018 , Swedish teenager and NN activist Greta Thunberg began protesting in front of Swedish Parliament with a sign : “ School Strike for NNP . ” Her protest to raise awareness for JJ NN caught DT NN by storm and by November 2018 , over 17,000 students in 24 NNS were participating in NN strikes . By March 2019 , Thunberg was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize . She participated in DT NNP Nations NNP Summit in NNP York City in August of 2019 , famously taking a boat across DT Atlantic instead of flying to reduce her carbon footprint . DT UN NNP Action Summit reinforced d IN “ 1.5 ℃ is DT socially , economically , politically and scientifically safe limit to JJ NN by DT end of this century , ” and set a deadline for achieving net zero NNS to 2050 .

For too long PRP have collectively ignored DT fruits of scientific analysis , and catastrophic predictions can no longer be viewed with contempt and irony . ” DT pope ’s words Friday went beyond sounding a general alarm and scorning NN - NN skeptics . PRP RB urged specific political action , most notably regarding penalties for carbon usage such as a carbon tax . “ A carbon pricing policy is essential if humanity wants to use DT resources of creation wisely , ” he VBD . “ DT failure to manage carbon NNS has produced a huge debt WDT will now have to be repaid with interest from those who come after PRP . ” DT cost of carbon usage must be paid here and now by those who use PRP , and not deferred for future generations to cover , he proposed ."

Why , sometimes I ’ve believed as JJ as six impossible things before breakfast . ” – Lewis Carroll , Through DT Looking Glass [ 1 ] DT NN 2019 saw DT unfolding of a number of dramatic events . At DT beginning of DT NN , DT Venezuelan opposition orchestrated a coup , with dozens of NNS including a number of South American NNS recognizing opposition figure Juan Guaidó as NN . This attempt appears to have failed miserably as DT military and DT bulk of DT Venezuelan population appear to oppose an undemocratic regime NN . In March , DT NNP Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in DT Near East ( UNRWA ) MD release a report detailing DT deaths of Palestinians at DT hands of Israeli Defense Forces in DT wake of DT great March of Return protests at DT Gaza - Israel perimeter fence MD approach 200 , with 29,000 injured . In April , Wikileaks founder Julian Assange was forcefully removed from DT Ecuadorean Embassy in DT NNP Kingdom where he had sought sanctuary from a wrongful and unjust prosecution at DT hands of DT U.S . In June , U.S. - Iran tensions MD escalate with attacks on oil tankers in Gulf of Oman near DT Strait of Hormuz culminating in DT drone killing in early January of high ranking Iranian military figure Qasem Soleimani . Popular uprisings around DT globe were unquestionably a feature of DT NN . DT Gilets Jaunes ( Yellow Vests ) movement endured throughout DT entirety of DT NN with weekly demonstrations against DT Macron NN ’s neoliberal reforms . Likewise , DT uprisings in Hong Kong grabbed much of DT NN spotlight , And later in DT NN , DT NN MD see popular eruptions in Ecuador , Chile , and other Latin American centres , in Haiti , in Sudan and in Lebanon . On DT NN NN front , while Greta Thunberg and DT youth NN activists took centre stage in unprecedented numbers , infernos light up DT Amazon , California and Australia , NNS highlight DT threat to JJ food supply from NN NN , DT NN ’s oceans are being depleted of oxygen , DT melting of glacial and polar NN accelerates , and DT UN ’s NNP Meteorological Organization reports IN DT concentration of NN - heating greenhouse gases has hit another all - NN high with “ no sign of a slowdown , let alone a decline . ” And of course , DT impeachment drama in Washington continues to transfix JJ Americans while poverty has increased in 30 percent of U.S counties , and while a bi-partisan consensus on Capitol Hill approved last August military spending exceeding what was spent at DT height of DT Cold War , even adjusting for inflation . For independent NN outlets IN DT NNP Research NNP Hour , NN stories are curated according to how PRP impact DT broader population , not according to their service to DT corporate and NN interests WDT underwrite most press outlets . Through DT lens , DT show takes an overdue opportunity to evaluate some of DT more important stories and developments of DT past NN . Our first guest , Andy Lee Roth of Project Censored , discusses some of DT Top 25 most censored stories of 2018 - 2019 , and other themes from DT publication Censored 2020 . These include NN tank partnerships which turn Facebook into a tool of U.S. Foreign Policy ( 2 ) , high rates of unemployment among formerly incarcerated Americans ( 17 ) , and a more equitable model for providing meals for schoolchildren in DT U.S. ( 23 ) . In DT final half hour , PRP present a wide - ranging conversation on DT NN stories and trends of 2019 featuring independent NN icons Abby and Robbie Martin ( NNP Roots radio ) along with NNP Research NNP Hour co-hosts Michael Welch and Scott Price . Themes range from DT marginalization of dissident viewpoints and analysis under DT guise of controlling ‘ fake NN ’ to DT co-opting of ‘ Deep NNP ’ analysis and ‘ NN culture ’ into a kind of partisan cudgel , to DT growth of DT U.S. empire under NNP , to DT corporate and ecological elements missing from coverage of DT fires raging around DT NN . Andy Lee Roth , is DT Associate Director of Project Censored , a NN research program which fosters student development of NN literacy and critical thinking skills as applied to NN NN censorship in DT NNP NNPS . Abby Martin is an investigative journalist and co-producer of Telesur ’s DT Empire Files . She RB wrote and directed DT 2019 documentary film Gaza Fights for Freedom . She co-hosts DT NNP Roots Radio podcast along with her brother Robbie Martin . Robbie Martin is a writer , musician and film maker . He produced DT three part documentary film series A Very Heavy Agenda , about DT rise and persistent role of DT neocons within DT Washington establishment ."

PRP live and breed in some of DT NN ’s harshest conditions , nesting in DT windblown , rocky coves of DT Antarctic Peninsula , a strip of land comprising DT northernmost part of DT frigid continent . In NN PRP are precision hunters , darting after krill , DT tiny shrimp - IN crustaceans WDT are their sole food source , utilizing barbed tongues engineered for catching DT slipperiest of prey . On land , these 2 - 2.5 - foot - tall flightless birds are prodigious mountaineers , able to scale rocky escarpments in spite of their ungainly waddle . Their perfect adaptation to local conditions makes them DT ideal barometer for DT future of DT region . If anything changes in DT marine environment , DT NN of chinstrap penguins will be CD of DT most reliable indicators . PRP are DT canaries of DT Southern Ocean . And these endearing , black and white emissaries from Antarctic waters are starting to disappear . NNS conducting a chinstrap census along DT Antarctic Peninsula have discovered drastic declines in JJ colonies , with some seeing population reductions of up to 77 % since PRP were last surveyed , about 50 NNS ago . DT independent researchers , who hitched a ride on a Greenpeace expedition to DT region , found IN every single CD of DT 32 colonies surveyed on Elephant Island , a major chinstrap outpost , had declined . Overall , DT island ’s total chinstrap population had dropped by more than half , from 122,550 breeding pairs in 1971 to 52,786 in January 2020 . “ Such significant declines suggest IN DT Southern Ocean ’s ecosystem is fundamentally changed from 50 NNS ago , and IN DT impacts of this are rippling up DT food web to species IN chinstrap penguins , ” says Heather J. Lynch , associate professor of ecology & evolution at Stony Brook University in upstate NNP York , who designed DT NN . “ EX is something broken in DT Southern Ocean , ” adds ornithologist Noah Strycker , a member of DT penguin census team , and DT author of DT 2015 book . “ Our best guess on why DT MD be is NN NN , which PRP VBP is hitting DT Antarctic Peninsula region harder than …practically anywhere else in DT NN except DT Arctic . ” NN waters reduce DT NN NN and DT phytoplankton WDT krill depend upon for feeding and survival . Ocean acidification , a side effect of increasing JJ carbon NNS , RB impacts their ability to reproduce . For DT past five weeks Stony Brook NNS have joined forces with robotics and drone specialists from Boston ’s Northeastern University to survey relatively unstudied chinstrap penguin colonies along DT western coast of DT Antarctic Peninsula . Chinstraps prefer rocky , windblown sites for nesting , because PRP provide DT best conditions for keeping eggs safe and dry . Those conditions make research difficult : DT NNS endured freezing temperatures , wind , rain and snow to reach DT coastal rookeries by small inflatable motorboats , then scrambled among DT colonies counting penguins by hand . DT robotics team backed up DT survey with drone footage . When PRP return to DT lab , members of DT team will use DT findings to teach computers how to identify nests using artificial intelligence for help in future surveys . DT researchers surveyed 56 colonies in 37 days . So far , PRP ’ve only released numbers from DT Elephant Island sites , which were DT first to be surveyed . DT final report will be published in a few weeks . But those initial findings appear to be consistent across most colonies . “ From whatever limited data PRP have from DT 1980s , chinstrap populations appear to be down by over half , ” says biologist Steve Forrest , DT team lead on DT expedition . On Jan. 31 , 2020 , 26 days into DT expedition , Forrest motored around DT NNP ’s Head promontory on Snow Island to scout for potential survey sites . Some 30 NNS ago , researchers documented a colony RB , but Forrest had heard rumors from passing boats WDT PRP had disappeared . DT NN was too rough for a census WDT day , but PRP did n’t matter . Peering through a pair of binoculars , Forrest saw no evidence IN EX were any penguins left on DT island at all . “ I was hoping IN PRP might find DT colony after all , ” he says . “ But not finding CD is more along DT lines of what PRP expected . ” Some of DT older surveys in DT more difficult - to - reach areas are unreliable — conducted at a distance , by boat — so an exact assessment of how much has changed in DT last three decades is impossible . Still , Forrest says , he is confident IN chinstrap populations are declining , particularly in DT South Shetland Islands ( including Elephant Island ) off DT coast of DT Peninsula . “ I saw a lot of abandoned nesting places , so I am inclined to believe IN PRP is a real decline , but DT precise extent is uncertain . ” While DT numbers of chinstraps MD be on DT wane , DT researchers saw a marked increase in gentoo penguin populations . Gentoos , which have red - orange beaks and lack DT distinctive black band around DT throat WDT gives chinstraps their names , are much more flexible about what PRP eat and DT conditions under which PRP breed . This means IN PRP can more easily adapt to changes in their environment . Forrest calls them “ NN NN winners ” for their ability to thrive in conditions WDT threaten chinstraps — at least in DT short term . Strycker calls DT process by which DT upstarts take over chinstrap areas “ gentoofication . ” Strycker , a committed birder who chronicled his attempt to spot more than half DT NN ’s bird species in a single NN in a 2017 book called Birding Without Borders : An Obsession , a Quest , and DT Biggest NNP in DT NNP admits IN ultimately , PRP ’s not even about DT penguins . PRP ’s about krill . Krill are DT foundation of DT marine food system — DT fish WDT eat them are DT fodder for DT fish on which almost every ocean predator relies . DT fish WDT PRP humans eat RB primarily rely on krill as a food source . If krill populations are unhealthy , PRP means trouble down DT line for everyone else . But krill , in their krillions , are hard to VB . DT ’s where DT chinstraps come in . IN certain whale species , chinstraps are krill specialists , but PRP are relatively easier to track compared to whales , with their erratic migration patterns . Chinstrap penguins reliably return to DT same rookeries NN after NN to breed , so by assessing colony NN over NN , NNS can VB a better idea of how DT krill PRP depend on are doing . Which is “ why PRP should care about a bunch of penguins VBG missing from a remote island WDT no NN ’s ever heard of , ” says Strycker . “ Penguins give PRP an idea about what is VBG on in DT ocean around PRP . DT ocean processes WDT are changing in DT Antarctic are similar to DT processes WDT are changing everywhere else in DT NN . ” Humans MD not have evolved to catch krill DT way chinstraps do , but our fate is tied to DT tiny crustaceans all DT same ."

Glaciers and NN sheets from DT Himalayas to Antarctica are rapidly melting And DT fisheries WDT feed millions of NNS are shrinking . These are just some of DT impacts IN NNS of greenhouse gases have already triggered across DT NN 's oceans and frozen regions , according to a JJ landmark report from DT NNP Nations ' Intergovernmental Panel on NNP NNP ( IPCC ) . "" This report is unique because for DT first NN ever , DT IPCC has produced an in - depth report examining DT furthest corners of DT NNP -- from DT highest mountains in remote polar regions to DT deepest oceans , "" VBD Ko Barrett , vice chair of DT IPCC . "" PRP 've found IN even and especially in these places , human - caused NN NN is evident . "" PRP is just DT latest scientific evidence showing IN human - induced NN is rapidly taking DT NN down an uncharted path . DT NNS say EX MD be some impacts to DT JJ NN -- IN some amount of NN level rise -- WDT can no longer be stopped . But even though EX is uncertainty in DT report about what exactly DT future holds , DT authors are unambiguous on this : Despite DT damage WDT has been done , humanity still has a choice . Taking swift action to end DT JJ economy 's dependence on fossil fuels can ward off some of DT worst projected impacts , PRP say . Or , PRP continue down DT path PRP are on , into a NN far less hospitable than DT NN PRP live in . This JJ report paints a full and alarming picture of DT rapid thawing happening in frozen regions all across DT globe -- and how DT changes will dramatically alter human civilization in DT coming decades . DT findings show IN DT NN 's NN is accelerating melting in glaciers and NN sheets from Greenland to Antarctica , and IN NN levels will likely rise more than previously projected by DT end of this century . Because of DT growing contributions from Antarctic melting , DT authors say NN level rise is now likely to exceed three feet by 2100 if carbon NNS continue to increase . Perhaps most concerning is what MD be happening to DT Antarctic NN sheet , which has DT potential to raise NN levels much higher . DT NNS warn IN more NN is needed , but say changes observed in parts of Antarctica MD be DT first signs DT NN sheet has reached a point of no return . "" If this is true , then EX is a chance of a multi - meter NN level rise within DT next two to three centuries , "" VBD Regine Hock , a professor at DT University of Alaska Fairbanks and a coordinating lead author on chapter two of this IPCC report . "" DT is very substantial . "" Even if collapse of DT Antarctic NN sheet is not imminent , DT report says IN JJ of DT 680 million NNS around DT NN living in low - lying coastal areas will experience annual flooding events by 2050 WDT used to occur only once a century . But over DT last 40 NNS , DT report finds IN Arctic NN NN is very likely shrinking during all months of DT NN , which is driving further NN . DT decrease observed in September NN NN is particularly significant and likely unprecedented for at least 1000 NNS . In nearly all regions , DT NNS RB found IN snow cover is diminishing and glaciers are in retreat . Runoff from these sources provides drinking NN to millions and is used to grow much of DT food PRP eat . And permafrost , soil WDT stays frozen throughout DT NN and contains gigatons of potentially NN - NN carbon and methane , has RB undergone record NN . NNS say DT oceans WDT cover 71 percent of NNP 's surface have borne DT brunt of DT NN WDT humans have caused . But DT report warns PRP can no longer keep up . PRP is "" virtually certain "" IN DT NN 's oceans have warmed nonstop since 1970 and have absorbed 90 percent of DT NN 's excess heat , DT report says . Marine heatwaves WDT have killed off vast stretches of NNP 's coral reefs have very likely doubled in frequency and are projected to become more common and intense , DT report finds . As a result , shifts have occurred in DT geographic ranges of JJ species and maximum fish catches have decreased , DT NNS say . Some regions , IN DT Arctic , MD see fish populations increase . But across DT NN 's tropics , fish and other seafood are likely to become harder to find . For DT millions of NNS around DT NN WDT depend on DT ocean as a primary food source , DT findings are troubling . "" Taken together , these changes show IN DT NN 's ocean and cryosphere have been taking DT heat for NN NN for decades , "" VBD Barrett . "" DT consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe . "" DT report is clear IN EX are some future impacts to DT oceans and NN WDT can not be avoided . Instead , JJ vulnerable cities and communities -- especially along DT coasts and in DT Arctic -- will be forced to adapt to DT changes . Doing so will be difficult , especially for those in DT poorest NNS . And DT scale and pace of DT changes coming , DT report warns , will challenge governments ' abilities to develop and implement solutions . But DT NN is equally clear IN JJ of DT projected impacts can be avoided through ambitious and rapid reductions in carbon NNS . For instance , rates of NN level rise are projected to reach 15 millimeters per NN by 2100 under a high NNS scenario . But under a lower NNS scenario -- where humans draw down JJ greenhouse gases very soon -- NN levels are expected to rise much slower at 4 millimeters per NN . "" PRP drives home DT message IN policies WDT curb greenhouse gas NNS can have a strong effect on future NN level rise , "" VBD Andrea Dutton , an associate professor in DT Department of Geoscience at DT University of Wisconsin Madison . "" What PRP do today can decide which of those pathways PRP 're on . "" DT choices made now are critical to limit DT future impacts , and avoid DT escalating costs and risks WDT come with delayed action , DT report says ."

A damning report compiled by DT UN's NNP Meteorological Organisation ( WMO ) highlights 2019 's increasing heat , accelerating NN level rises , and extreme weather . Last NN was DT second hottest NN on record , with a JJ average temperature of almost 2 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels , DT WMO VBD . DT five NNS from 2015 - 2019 were DT five warmest NNS on record and 2010 - 2019 was DT hottest decade since records began in DT 19th century . UN Secretary - General Antonio Guterres VBD action was needed urgently , IN EX is no NN to lose ' if PRP are to avert NN catastrophe . ' DT report found IN each decade since DT 1980s has been hotter than any preceding decade stretching back to 1850 when records began . DT NN had input from national meteorological services , international experts , scientific institutions and UN agencies . DT trends found so far continue in 2020 , with DT report published in DT wake of DT hottest January on record and some parts of DT northern hemisphere , including Europe , experiencing an unusually warm winter . Antarctica has reported JJ temperature highs , accompanied by large - scale NN melt and a fracturing glacier which will have ' repercussions for NN level rise ' . Petteri Taalas , secretary - general of DT NNP Meteorological Organization VBD at a briefing on DT agency 's annual NN of DT NNP NNP 2019 report IN carbon dioxide has contributed two - thirds of JJ NN . He VBD PRP has a ' lifetime is of several hundreds of NNS - so PRP 's a problem WDT does n't VB away if PRP let these concentrations continue . ' This NN NNS are expected , under DT international Paris Agreement on NN NN , to increase their action to tackle greenhouse gas NNS to prevent DT worst impacts of JJ NN . In a foreword to DT report , Guterres VBD : ' PRP are currently way off track to meeting DT targets WDT DT Paris Agreement calls for . ' This report outlines DT latest NN and illustrates DT urgency for far - reaching NN action . ' Alongside temperature increases , rainfall changes had a major impact on several NNS and NN levels were rising at an increasing pace , exposing coastal areas and islands to a greater risk of flooding and submersion , he VBD . Greenhouse gas levels in DT atmosphere continued to rise in 2019 , and carbon NNS from JJ fossil fuels grew 0.6 per cent last NN . DT report found record high temperatures from Australia to India , Japan , and Europe RB impacted on NNS 's NN . EX were two major heatwaves in Europe , in June and July , with JJ national temperature records set in DT UK , where DT thermometer hit 38.7C . EX were RB record temperatures in Germany , DT Netherlands , Belgium , Luxembourg and France . ' PRP have RB broken records in carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide , ' three greenhouse gases WDT cause JJ NN , ' VBD Taalas . ' Given IN greenhouse gas levels continue to increase , DT NN will continue . ' He added PRP was a matter of NN before DT NN had a JJ record hot NN - with predictions PRP will come within five NNS . EX are RB implications for NN - with dengue fever spreading to DT point where half DT NN population is at risk of infection . NN hunger is on DT rise again , and an estimated 22 million NNS worldwide were forced to leave their homes by events such as floods and storms . Guterres , VBD : ' Greenhouse gas concentrations are at DT highest levels in 3 million NNS - when DT NNP 's temperature was as much as three degrees hotter and NN levels some 15 meters higher . ' Ocean heat is at a record level , with temperatures rising at DT equivalent of five Hiroshima bombs a second . ' Taalas VBD DT NN of DT oceans has led to unusual tropical storms , including CD in Mozambique in March 2019 WDT was DT strongest in DT Southern Hemisphere 'at least for DT past hundred NNS . ' He VBD EX is RB an estimate ' IN NN NN is DT most acid in 25 million NNS ... and DT 's VBG to have negative impacts on DT NN ecosystems . ' Taalas RB pointed to forest fires causing a lot of NNS , in DT Arctic and Australia where ' PRP were , again , record breaking . ' ' Smoke and pollutants from damaging fires in Australia circumnavigated DT globe , causing a spike in carbon dioxide NNS , ' he VBD . DT contiguous NNP , excluding Alaska , Hawaii and other islands , experienced DT highest 12 - month rainfall on record from July 2018 to June 2019 , and DT country lost an estimated $ 20 billion ( £ 15 billion ) from flooding last NN . Drought or low rainfall hit JJ parts of DT NN , including Australia , which RB saw its hottest NN and hottest December on record and an exceptionally long and severe season of wildfires . Some parts of DT Arctic RB burned - an extremely rare occurrence - and NN NN in DT region continued to decline . DT Greenland NN sheet saw 329 billion tonnes of NN loss in 2019 , well above DT average for recent NNS , and glaciers continue to melt . NN levels were at record highs in 2019 , and at least 84 per cent of DT oceans experienced at least CD marine heatwave . NN ocean temperatures , along with more acidic NN and lower oxygen levels , are having an impact on marine wildlife and habitats such as coral . JJ NNS say DT use of fossil fuels , which are CD of DT main sources of greenhouse gases , need to end by DT middle of DT century if average temperatures on NNP are to rise no more than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 . So far 70 NNS have announced PRP are committed to net - zero carbon NNS by 2050 , joined by cities , banks , businesses and others , but this still represents only CD - quarter of JJ NNS . ' DT largest emitters must commit or our efforts will be in vain , ' Guterres VBD . In DT coming months , DT UN will be ' very actively engaging ' Western Europe nations including DT NNP , Canada , NNP , India , Russia and Japan . This is ' in order to have as JJ as possible , ideally all of them , committed to carbon neutrality in 2050 , ' DT secretary - general VBD . Guterres pointed to ' good NN ' from DT European Union , which unveiled plans last week for its first - ever NN law WDT MD legally bind its executive arm to cutting greenhouse gas NNS by mid-century .

DT highly contagious phocine distemper NN — which is not believed to affect humans — attacks DT respiratory and nervous systems of some marine mammals . But EX was no indication PRP had infected animals WDT MD have taken PRP to different parts of DT NN . “ How did a NN WDT had previously been seen in DT Atlantic Ocean end up in DT Pacific Ocean ? ” VBD Tracey Goldstein , associate director of DT NNP NNP Institute at DT University of California , Davis , School of Veterinary Medicine . Goldstein and some of her colleagues examined 15 NNS of data WDT included measurements of Arctic NN NN and data from animals WDT had been tagged by DT National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other institutions to VB their migration patterns . Their conclusion : Melting Arctic NN NN brought on by DT NNP ’s NN NN created a way for DT NN to move into a JJ region and infect a JJ population of NN life . “ PRP was a perfect storm in 2002 , ” she VBD . “ PRP was DT lowest NN NN on record at DT NN , and at DT same NN , in August and September , EX was a really large outbreak . ” DT work of Goldstein and her colleagues , published Wednesday in DT journal Scientific Reports , RB used blood and nasal swab samples from seals , NN lions and otters from southeast Alaska to Russia to assess which populations had been infected with DT NN , and which specific strain PRP had been exposed to . DT researchers noticed a link between NN NN losses in DT Arctic and spikes in outbreaks of DT NN . In particular , DT NNS found IN drastic reductions in NN NN on DT Russian side of DT North Atlantic coincided with increases in exposure rates in both ocean basins . DT melted NN , Goldstein VBD , was likely opening up JJ waterways for infected animals to come into contact with other species . DT NN adds to growing research IN JJ NN is having some unexpected impacts on animal and human NN , such as increasing outbreaks of toxic algal blooms WDT can sicken marine animals and widening DT range of ticks WDT carry potentially devastating diseases . EX ’s no evidence to suggest IN phocine distemper NN can be transmitted to humans , but DT NN belongs to DT same family as DT measles . And IN DT measles , PRP ’s highly virulent . DT NN is likely being spread among DT animals when PRP gather to nest and breed , or when PRP feed in close proximity , according to DT NN ’s lead author Elizabeth VanWormer , who conducted DT research as a postdoctoral researcher at UC Davis but is now an assistant professor at DT University of Nebraska , Lincoln . Enabling transmission of DT distemper NN is not DT only way IN NN NN is impacting animal NN . Along DT west coast of DT NNP NNPS , NN ocean temperatures have intensified outbreaks of harmful algal blooms WDT can sicken marine mammals , VBD Shawn Johnson , DT director of veterinary NN at DT Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito , California , who was not involved with DT JJ research . “ PRP ’re seeing more and more of these toxic blooms affecting our animals , ” Johnson VBD . “ This is not unique . PRP ’s just another important piece of evidence showing IN NN NN is impacting DT marine mammals all up and down DT West Coast . ” DT NN ’s findings have implications not only for marine mammal populations but RB DT delicate balances WDT exist within ecosystems . “ When PRP see these changes happening in animals , PRP ca n’t ignore them , because DT impacts on NNS and DT NN are not far behind , ” VanWormer VBD . ” This shows how interconnected these things are — DT NN of NNS , animals and DT NN . ” DT research should RB act as a warning sign for DT potential impacts WDT NN NN can have on DT ability to fight diseases and prevent their spread , according to Johnson . “ DT NN is changing so rapidly , ” he VBD . “ Understanding how diseases and DT ecology of diseases are changing in wildlife and marine mammals will give PRP insight into DT future , and how PRP need to be prepared for a JJ paradigm of NN transmissions in animals and in humans . ”"

Dermatitis is a common condition WDT has JJ causes and occurs in JJ forms . PRP usually involves itchy , dry skin or a rash on swollen , reddened skin . Or PRP MD cause DT skin to blister , ooze , crust or flake off . Examples of this condition are atopic dermatitis ( eczema ) , dandruff and contact dermatitis . Dermatitis is n't contagious , but PRP can make PRP feel uncomfortable and self - conscious . Moisturizing regularly helps control DT symptoms . Treatment MD RB include medicated ointments , creams and shampoos . Each type of dermatitis MD look a little different and tends to occur on different parts of your body . Signs and symptoms of different types of dermatitis include : • Atopic dermatitis ( eczema ) . Usually beginning in infancy , this red , itchy rash usually occurs where DT skin flexes — inside DT elbows , behind DT knees and in front of DT neck . DT rash MD leak fluid when scratched and crust over . NNS with atopic dermatitis MD experience improvement and then seasonal flare - ups . • Contact dermatitis . This red , itchy stinging rash occurs where your skin has come into contact with substances WDT irritate DT skin or cause an allergic reaction . PRP MD develop blisters . • Seborrheic dermatitis . This condition causes scaly patches , red skin and stubborn dandruff . PRP usually affects oily areas of DT body , such as DT face , upper chest and back . Seborrheic dermatitis can be a long - term condition with periods of improvement and then seasonal flare - ups . In infants , this condition is called cradle cap . • Follicular eczema . With this type , DT affected skin thickens and develops bumps in hair follicles . This condition is common in African Americans and in NNS with dark - brown skin . When to see a doctor See your doctor if : • PRP 're so uncomfortable IN PRP are losing sleep or are distracted from your daily routines • PRP suspect your skin is infected • PRP 've tried self - care steps but your signs and symptoms persist Causes of DT most common types of dermatitis include : • Atopic dermatitis ( eczema ) . This type is likely related to dry skin , a gene variation , an immune system dysfunction , a skin infection , exposure to food , airborne , or contact allergens , or a combination of these . • Contact dermatitis . This type results from contact with something WDT irritates your skin or causes an allergic reaction . Irritants or allergens include poison ivy , perfumes , jewelry containing nickel , cleaning products , and DT preservatives in JJ creams and lotions . • Seborrheic dermatitis . This type is caused by a yeast ( fungus ) WDT is in DT oil secretion on DT skin . • Age . Dermatitis can occur at any age , but atopic dermatitis ( eczema ) usually begins in infancy . • Allergies and asthma . NNS who have a personal or family history of eczema , allergies , hay fever or asthma are more likely to develop atopic dermatitis . • Occupation . Jobs WDT put PRP in contact with certain metals , solvents or cleaning supplies increase your risk of contact dermatitis . Being a NN care worker is linked to hand eczema . • NN conditions . NN conditions WDT put PRP at increased risk of seborrheic dermatitis include congestive heart failure , Parkinson 's NN and HIV / AIDS . Scratching DT itchy rash associated with dermatitis can cause open sores , which MD become infected . These skin infections can spread and MD very rarely become life - threatening . Wear protective clothing if PRP are doing a task WDT involves irritants or caustic chemicals . Avoid dry skin by adopting these habits when bathing : • Take shorter baths and showers . Limit your baths and showers to 5 to 10 minutes . Use warm , rather than hot , NN . Bath oil RB MD be helpful . • Use a gentle , nonsoap cleanser . Choose unscented nonsoap cleansers . Some soaps can dry your skin . • Dry yourself gently . After bathing , gently pat your skin dry with a soft towel . • Moisturize your skin . While your skin is still damp , seal in moisture with an oil , cream or lotion . Try different products to find CD WDT works for PRP . Ideally , DT best NN for PRP will be safe , effective , affordable and unscented . Two small studies showed IN applying a protective moisturizer to DT skin of infants at high risk of atopic dermatitis reduced DT incidence of DT condition by up to 50 percent ."

But CD of DT main points PRP make — linking control of women ’s reproduction to environmental goals — is problematic . Focusing on what women in poor nations with DT highest birth rates can do to curb NN NN distracts from holding wealthy NNS and corporations accountable for their disproportionate harm to DT NN and imperils DT right to reproductive autonomy . DT paper , “ NNP NNPS ’ Warning of a NNP Emergency , ” was published in early November on DT 40th anniversary of DT first NN NN conference . PRP rightfully warns of “ untold suffering ” without “ major transformations in DT ways our JJ society functions . ” Reducing population growth is CD of six steps DT authors say MD slow carbon dioxide NNS . PRP RB argue IN to decrease DT birthrate , family planning services and primary and secondary education need to be more available and accessible . DT group ’s website goes a big step further . PRP says families must be encouraged to have fewer NNS and sounds DT overpopulation alarm . A startling graph shows a dramatic NN population spike beginning in DT 19th century . DT accompanying text refers to NNS giving birth as “ adding more carbon emitters to DT NN . ” This presents a troubling and unfair picture and promotes DT scapegoating of women . Access to family planning and education are essential to gender equity and must be fiercely promoted in their own right . But arguing IN PRP are an instrument against NN NN implies IN DT most disenfranchised have an outsize role to play in DT fight because of higher birth rates , when in reality PRP contribute very little to greenhouse gas NNS . High - and upper - middle - income NNS have higher per-capita NNS and account for 86 % of JJ carbon NNS , despite having DT lowest fertility rates . And even though some observers argue JJ development will lead to higher per-capita carbon NNS from poor NNS in DT future , DT JJ scientific and policy communities ’ response should be laser - focused on bold systemic changes , such as restraining DT use of fossil fuels , rather than persuading NNS to have fewer NNS . Emphasizing population reduction as a response to JJ NN is RB problematic because PRP MD provide a perverse incentive for family planning services to lose sight of NNS ’s right to make their own decisions about contraception and childbearing . DT NNS ’ warning rightly says IN family planning programs should be voluntary and ethical , but those concepts can start to blur when women ’s choices are put in competition with DT future of DT NN . Historically , population growth alarmism coupled with eugenic ideas about who is worthy of reproducing has led to a painful JJ legacy of coercion and abuse — including , most prominently , NNS of forced sterilization in India and NNP ’s CD - child policy . Such blatant examples have been less common in DT NNS since DT landmark 1994 International Conference on Population and Development marked a shift away from population control toward protecting reproductive NN and rights . However , those ideas have n’t died . Just four NNS ago , Stanford University biologist Paul Ehrlich , who wrote DT 1968 book “ DT Population Bomb , ” VBD he MD endorse “ various forms of coercion ” to keep NNS from having more NNS . An inherent and unresolvable tension remains between viewing family planning as a tool to mitigate NN NN and valuing an individual ’s right to choose to have a child . Framing family planning as a means to an end — especially when DT “ end ” is as urgent and important as slowing NN NN — MD lead anxious policymakers and healthcare providers focused on reducing population to push contraceptive methods WDT are considered more effective , without regard for a woman ’s needs and preferences . PRP MD RB lead them to be less likely to make sure women are able to have provider - controlled methods — such as intrauterine devices or contraceptive implants — removed on demand . Curbing NN NN and making high - quality , rights - based contraception and abortion services accessible to those who VBP them are both urgent issues WDT deserve attention and resources . However , DT misplaced emphasis on poor women ’s reproduction risks sacrificing human rights to chip away at NN NN , a massive problem WDT needs transformational solutions . And PRP RB distracts from DT fact IN poor communities are DT least likely to have DT resources to mitigate DT devastating impact of NN NN on their lives and livelihoods , and thus have DT most to lose . Even if women in poor NNS stopped having NNS tomorrow , without massive decarbonization of DT economy neither DT NN nor their lives will be any better off now or in DT future . As NN - NN NNS continue to push DT NN toward urgent action , PRP should avoid family planning as a solution . Instead , PRP can follow DT lead of DT NN justice movement and promote a human - rights - based approach WDT holds governments and businesses accountable for reducing reliance on fossil fuels — and for mitigating DT disproportionate burden borne by DT most poor and disenfranchised . A bold vision for tackling DT NN emergency requires nothing less .

In DT latest of a series of reports , DT NNP Accountability Office says IN costs of disaster assistance to taxpayers since 2005 have swelled to nearly $ 500 billion — and PRP keep getting higher . “ DT federal budget , however , does not generally account for disaster assistance provided by Congress or DT long - term impacts of NN NN on existing federal infrastructure and programs , ” GAO found in DT 16 - page report , which was presented as testimony to Congress by Alfredo Gómez , director of DT office ’s natural resources and environment team . Moreover , DT NN “ does not have certain information needed by policymakers to help understand DT budgetary impacts of such exposure , ” GAO found . DT findings follow a dramatic escalation in federal spending on disaster assistance since 2005 . Much of DT money — upward of $ 450 billion — has been appropriated under supplemental spending packages following disasters rather than through DT normal budgetary process . In 2018 , Congress approved $ 91 billion in disaster spending to help communities recover from hurricanes , floods , wildfire and drought . DT outflow of disaster dollars has continued into 2019 ; Congress has passed bills authorizing an additional $ 19.1 billion , according to federal figures . DT growing frequency and intensity of disasters is being felt in every region of DT country and across a broad cross-section of DT economy , from NN and real estate to farming and fisheries . DT report includes 21 examples of NN NN ’s JJ impacts , most of which will place additional strain on federal resources . PRP include infrastructure damage in coastal zones from NN - level rise and storm surges , increased heat - related mortality in DT Southeast and Midwest , changes in NN supply and demand in DT West , and decreased agricultural yields in DT southern Plains and Southwest . GAO RB identified two types of potential benefits from NN NN : fewer deaths from cold weather in DT Upper Midwest and improved agricultural yields in DT northern Great Plains and parts of DT Northwest , mainly associated with longer growing seasons . Financial exposure to NN disasters will be felt hardest in three pots of NN spending : disaster response , flood and crop insurance , and operation and management of federally owned property and JJ lands . Investigators noted IN DT National Flood Insurance Program , for example , owes DT U.S. Treasury $ 21 billion associated with massive payouts to flood victims dating back to 2005 . Similarly , DT Congressional Budget Office estimated in NNP 2019 IN federal crop insurance MD cost DT NN an average of about $ 8 billion annually from 2019 through 2029 due to worsening floods , droughts and other NN stressors . Federal properties , IN Tyndall Air Force Base on DT Florida Panhandle , are RB facing increased financial exposure from hurricanes and other extreme weather events , GAO VBD . Hurricane Michael virtually destroyed Tyndall in 2018 , and its reconstruction is estimated to cost more than $ 4 billion ( Climatewire , July 3 ) . Rob Moore , a senior policy analyst and expert on NN adaptation and resilience at DT Natural Resources Defense Council , VBD GAO ’s findings are consistent with previous warnings from financial experts IN DT costs of NN disasters are far exceeding DT NN ’s ability to pay . Federal agencies “ are still treating these disasters as random events . PRP just throw a bunch of money at them after DT fact and assume PRP wo n’t happen again . DT problem is PRP ’re having these types of disasters every NN now , ” Moore VBD . Spending hundreds of billions of dollars in disaster - specific supplemental relief cannot continue , he added . “ PRP need to both start accounting for DT growing need to respond to disasters within DT regular appropriations process , ” Moore VBD . “ More importantly , PRP need to start making investments WDT reduce our exposure and vulnerability to these types of damages . ” Reprinted from Climatewire with permission from E&E NNP .

Brazilian NNS measured a temperature of 20.75 degrees Celsius ( approximately 69.35 degrees Fahrenheit ) on Seymour Island Feb. 9 , CD of DT researchers told AFP Thursday . DT record was broken three days after DT Antarctic continent recorded its highest temperature to date at a balmy 18.3 degrees Celsius ( approximately 64.9 degrees Fahrenheit ) . DT measure was taken at Argentina ’s Esperanza station on DT Antarctic peninsula WDT extends north towards South America . DT Brazilian reading was taken on CD of DT islands WDT extends off DT peninsula , according to BBC NNP . PRP breaks DT previous record for DT entire Antarctic region , defined by DT NNP Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) as all DT land and NN south of 60 degrees . DT previous record for DT region of 19.8 degrees Celsius ( approximately 67.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) was recorded in 1982 on Signy Island . Schaefer was careful to point out IN DT temperature reading was not part of a larger NN and so MD not be used as evidence of a NN trend . However , Antarctica as a whole has warmed by almost three degrees Celsius over DT past 50 NNS , according to WMO data reported by BBC NNP . During DT NN , about 87 percent of DT glaciers on its western coast have retreated . DT region RB just recorded its warmest January on record . Schaefer works as part of Brazil ’s Terrantar project WDT studies 23 sites in Antarctica . Temperatures on DT peninsula , DT South Shetland Islands and DT James Ross archipelago cooled during DT first decade of DT 21st century , and then began to rise quickly , he told DT Guardian . DT peninsula and its surrounding islands have been DT areas of Antarctica most impacted by DT NN crisis so far , which means PRP might indicate how DT rest of DT region will react . If all of DT NN in Antarctica were to melt , PRP MD cause 50 to 60 meters ( approximately 164 to 197 feet ) of NN level rise . This MD take centuries , however . In DT nearer term , NNS predict 30 to 110 centimeters ( approximately 12 to 43 inches ) of NN level rise by 2100 , depending on how successfully greenhouse gas NNS are reduced and how DT NN reacts ."

NN activists MD view crude oil ’s decline as a positive development , with more industries moving away from fossil fuels and into carbon - neutral NN sources . However , PRP ’s unlikely IN paradigm shift has reached critical mass , given healthy demand as a result of DT multiyear JJ expansion . In addition , dwindling crude oil resources around DT NN in coming NNS is likely to generate a premium for DT commodity , with remaining users forced to pay up due to lower supply . Fortunately , DT evolution of crude oil prices has been moving at a snail ’s pace , telling market players EX ’s plenty of NN to take action if exposed to DT industry through NN stocks or DT futures markets . However , as PRP learned in 2008 , contract volatility can escalate rapidly in response to system shocks IN DT NN ’s JJ collapse , so PRP makes sense to keep a watch on price action at all times . DT contract soared from DT mid-teens into DT lower 40s in just 4 months in 1990 , driven higher by DT first Iraqi invasion . PRP settled back to NN a few months later , reentering a multiyear trading range WDT broke to DT upside once again in 2004 when NN economies were getting back on DT feet after DT burst Internet bubble . DT uptrend went parabolic in 2006 , driven by heavy speculation as a result of NNP ’s multi-trillion dollar industrial expansion . A vertical plunge followed 2008 ’s all - NN high at 147.47 , dropping DT contract into a test at breakout support in DT first quarter of 2009 . PRP made steady progress into 2011 , finally reversing a few points under DT .786 Fibonacci selloff retracement level . DT marked DT highest high in DT last 9 NNS , ahead of a broad trading range WDT broke to DT downside in 2014 . DT selloff printed DT first lower monthly high for DT contract in more than two decades . DT decline found support at DT 2009 low at DT start of 2016 , giving way to a healthy uptick WDT stalled after NNP NNP fired DT first shot of DT trade war in 2018 . PRP printed DT second lower high in 7 NNS at DT NN , turning south at DT .50 retracement of DT 2 - NN slide . This downturn found support in DT low 40s at DT end of DT NN but DT contract failed to make headway in 2019 and MD be headed into a critical test at DT 2016 low . DT WTI crude oil contract MD have entered DT next phase of a massive descending triangle pattern WDT forecasts much lower prices in coming decades .

Avaaz examined 5,537 videos retrieved by DT search terms “ NN NN , ” JJ NN ” and “ NN manipulation , ” and then DT videos most likely to be suggested next by YouTube ’s “ up next ” sidebar . For each of those search terms respectively , 8 % , 16 % and 21 % of DT top 100 related videos included by YouTube in DT “ up - next ” feature contained information WDT goes against DT scientific consensus on NN NN – such as denying NN NN is taking place , or claiming IN human activity is not a cause of NN NN . Avaaz claims this promotion process means YouTube is helping to spread NN denialism . “ PRP ’ve found IN PRP ’s very likely IN at least CD in five users who search for a term IN JJ NN or NN NN MD be sent down this type of misinformation rabbit hole , ” says Fadi Quran , a campaigns director at Avaaz , and CD of DT report ’s authors . “ NNS are working so hard to educate NNS about DT existential threat PRP face and YouTube is allowing bad actors among PRP DT last word on this issue for JJ NNS . ” Smaller scale studies have previously suggested IN a majority of NN - related videos on YouTube oppose DT scientific consensus on NN NN . DT “ up next ” feature dictates what users watch for 70 % of DT NN PRP spend on YouTube . DT exact make - up of DT YouTube algorithm WDT drives recommendations , designed to keep users on DT platform for as long as possible , is a closely guarded secret . Experts say DT algorithm appears to have learned IN radical or outrageous content is more likely to engage viewers . When PRP comes to NN NN , Avaaz says , DT leads to DT promotion of controversial videos with titles such as “ JJ NN is a hoax ” and “ ACTUAL SCIENTIST : NNP NN is a Scam ! ” DT algorithm is RB personalized to each user , meaning IN after PRP watch CD video containing NN misinformation , PRP is more likely to recommend another for PRP . In January 2019 , responding to criticism over DT platform ’s tendency to drive NNS towards more radical political and social viewpoints , YouTube announced IN in DT U.S. PRP MD begin reducing recommendations of “ borderline ” content WDT pushed DT limits of Community Guidelines on areas IN hate speech , as well as “ content WDT MD misinform users in harmful ways — such as videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness , claiming DT NN is flat , or making blatantly false claims about historic events IN 9/11 ” . In December , YouTube VBD IN policy had been successful , driving down DT average NN spent by U.S. users watching recommended “ borderline ” content or harmful misinformation by 70 % . But Quran says PRP remains unclear if DT policy is effectively applied to NN denialist content . “ PRP say all scientifically inaccurate information WDT causes harm is included under DT policy — which should indicate IN NN denial is part of PRP , ” he says . “ However [ YouTube ’s parent company ] is not transparent and our research so far indicates IN NN denial videos are still being actively recommended . Either their downgrading tools are not working as PRP should , or PRP have decided to exclude NN denial from DT system . ” A YouTube spokesperson tells NN , “ PRP ca n’t speak to Avaaz ’s methodology or results , and our recommendations systems are not designed to filter or demote videos or channels based on specific perspectives . ” PRP add IN YouTube ’s systems “ prioritize authoritative voices for millions of NN and information queries , and surface information panels on topics prone to misinformation — including NN NN — to provide users with context alongside their content ” and IN DT systems appear to have done so “ in DT majority of NNS in this report ” . Ads for major brands appeared alongside DT videos containing NN misinformation seen by Avaaz . DT campaign group claims IN by promoting NN denial videos to drive more viewing NN , and by placing ads alongside these videos , YouTube is profiting from DT spread of misinformation . DT YouTube spokesperson says PRP have “ strict ad policies WDT govern where ads are allowed to appear and PRP give advertisers tools to opt out of content WDT does n’t align with their brand . ” Pressure from advertisers , some of whom Avaaz informed about their findings , MD potentially push YouTube to take more action on NN denial content . An advertising boycott in 2017 , when brands sought to prevent their ads appearing alongside extremist content , cost Google millions of dollars in revenue , and helped drive YouTube to strengthen efforts to limit how often its platform surfaced extremist content . ( As well as reducing DT promotion of borderline content , in June , DT platform began removing thousands of videos displaying white supremacism and other hateful ideologies . ) Stephan Lewandowsky , chair of DT cognitive psychology department at DT University of Bristol , who studies NN misinformation , says DT question is n’t whether YouTube MD deal with NN denialism on its platform , but whether RB DT company ’s leadership have DT political will to do so when EX is not yet “ political consensus ” in all NNS around NN NN . “ With DT radical Islamist and DT white supremacist material [ WDT YouTube has been successful in policing ] , PRP recognized DT was something PRP definitely MD n’t VB away with [ hosting ] , ” he says . “ With NN denial , even though PRP is a scientifically totally absurd position , EX are plenty of politicians in DT U.S. and Australia , for example , who are immersed in this stuff . ” Misinformation around NN NN and its impacts are still commonplace in some prominent mainstream NN . On Jan. 14 , James Murdoch , son of Australian NN mogul Rupert Murdoch , criticized DT “ ongoing denial ” of DT NN crisis displayed by his father ’s NN outlets , particularly in coverage of Australia ’s current bushfire crisis . For Lewandowsky , DT promotion of NN denialism , both in DT NN and to YouTube users searching for content about NN NN , creates a major stumbling block to political momentum on cutting greenhouse gas NNS . “ For JJ NNS who are not trained NNS , ” he says , “ DT moment PRP ’re exposed to what appears to be a scientific debate — but is n’t actually , because DT NN was settled a long NN ago — PRP feel PRP can say “ Oh , well , DT NNS do n’t agree on this — PRP do n’t have to do anything . ” Sign up for CD .

The_DT above_JJ article_NN is_VBZ from_IN Wattsupwiththat.com_NNP ._. Visit_VB Wattsupwiththat.com_ADD for_IN more_JJR great_JJ articles_NNS ._.","DT real NN debate is not between “ believers ” and “ deniers ” . And not between Republicans and Democrats . DT real debate is certainly not over whether JJ NN , spurred by increasing greenhouse gases , is a serious problem WDT must be addressed . Both sides of DT real NN debate agree on DT . DT real rebate is between two groups : 1 . A confident , non-political group WDT believes technology , informed investments , rational decision making , and DT use of DT best scientific information will lead to a solution of DT JJ NN issue . An optimistic group WDT sees JJ NN as a technical problem with technical solutions . I will refer to these folks as DT ACT group ( Apolitical / Confident / Technical ) 2 . A group , mainly on DT political left , WDT is highly partisan , anxious and often despairing , self - righteous , big on blame and social justice , and willing to attack those WDT disagree with them . PRP often distort DT truth when PRP serves their interests . PRP RB see social NN as necessary for dealing with JJ NN , requiring DT very reorganization of society . I call these folks DT ASP group ( Anxious , Social - Justice , Partisan ) . EX is no better way to see DT profound difference between these two groups than to watch a video of DT testimony of young activists at DT recent House Hearing on NNP NNP , which included Greta Thunberg , Jamie Margolin , Vic Barrett , and Benji Backer . Jamie Margolin of Seattle talked about an apocalyptic future , with “ corporations making billions ” while PRP destroy DT future of her generation . Of feeling fear and despair . Of a NN where DT natural environment is undergoing collapse , where only a few NNS are left before PRP pass DT point of no return , and where only a massive political shift can fix things , including DT Green NNP Deal . Watch her testimony to see what I mean . Compare Ms. Margolin ’s testimony to DT of University of Washington senior Benji Backer . Mr. Backer , leader of DT American Conservation Coalition , a conservative / moderate group of young NNS supporting action to protect DT environment , approaches DT problem in a radically different way . Instead of despair , EX is optimism , recommending more scientific and technical research , a bipartisan attack on DT problem , a rejection of an apocalyptic future , DT building of JJ NN industries with potential benefits for DT American economy , and a dedication to follow DT NN and not political expediency . His testimony is here . Both Ms. Margolin and Mr. Backer care deeply about DT environment and VBP effective measures to deal with JJ NN . Both their approaches and attitudes MD not be more different . PRP see DT difference between DT optimistic ACT group and DT despairing ASP folks here in Seattle . On CD hand , EX is DT Clean Tech Alliance , which brings together technology companies , university researchers , and DT business community to develop and apply DT technologies WDT will produce DT carbon - free future PRP look for . Headed by Tom Ranken , DT Alliance does a lot , including a highly informative breakfast series where PRP can learn about fusion power , JJ battery technologies , DT future of solid waste recycling , and much more . Non-political , optimistic , and exciting . These are clearly members of DT ACT group . In contrast , EX is Seattle ’s 350.org group . PRP are into NN strikes , staging protests ( IN their recent blockade of a branch of Seattle Chase Bank ) , trying to muzzle NN NNS PRP do n’t VB , advocating political solutions to greenhouse NN ( Green NNP Deal ) , pushing divestment of NN companies , and even a Pledge of Resistance to stop NN exports by whatever means necessary . Their “ NN ” page has all kinds of extreme ( and unfounded ) claims regarding JJ NN impacts , IN a NN level rise of 10 feet in as little as 50 NNS . ASP group all DT way . I should note IN DT Seattle 350.org group and their “ allies ” oppose DT Tacoma Liquid Natural Gas ( LNG ) Facility WDT will help replace DT extraordinarily dirty “ bunker fuel ” used in ships traversing Puget Sound . LNG will RB reduce carbon NNS . NNS and regulators at DT Puget Sound Clean Air Agency support DT LNG facility . But facts and protection of DT NN of Puget Sound residents are not priorities for highly politicized groups IN 350.org . A good example of DT differences between DT ACT and ASP folks is found in Washington NNP ’s recent carbon initiatives . Initiative 732 was backed by Carbon Washington , a non-political group whose bi-partisan proposal MD have increased DT price of carbon fuels but was revenue neutral , giving all DT funds collected back to DT citizens of DT NNP . Carefully designed and impactful . DT work of DT ACT group all DT way . But DT ASP folks were unhappy . EX was no money for their NN justice and political initiatives , so PRP opposed PRP , and were joined by Governor Inslee and DT environmental left . Unforgivable , nasty attacks were made on Carbon Washington leadership by DT ASP folks . 732 lost . DT ASP collective decided PRP was their turn , so PRP created a Frankenstein carbon initiative ( 1631 ) , with a lowered ( less effective ) carbon fee , but CD in which NN justice groups and political allies on DT left MD have control , and were hardwired for much of DT funds . DT main advertising line of DT 1631 ads : catastrophe was around DT corner and DT big oil companies were to blame . 1631 was an election day disaster , losing by 13 points , and DT ASP folks have probably killed any hope for an effective carbon tax / fee in our NN . What about DT NN ? Which side are PRP on ? ASP or ACT or neither ? Much of DT “ mainstream ” NN parrots DT message of DT ASP side . DT Seattle Times is a great case in point , with headlines of massive heat related deaths ( 750 die per event ! ) and catastrophic wildfire seasons WDT have no basis in good NN . But EX are plenty of others , such as DT LA Times and DT NY Times . EX are some major NN outlets WDT are more balanced ( such as DT Wall Street Journal ) . A major issue for DT NN is DT hollowing out of NN reporting , with most NN stories being handled by general reporters with neither DT NN , background , or inclination to VB beyond parroting DT press releases of activist groups or evaluating DT claims of speculative research papers . PRP has gotten so bad IN a recent headline story in DT Seattle Times kept on talking about DT WRONG GAS ( carbon monoxide instead of carbon dioxide ) . A Religious Movement In JJ ways , DT ASP group appears to be a religious movement , not unlike DT JJ millennialist movements of DT past . As other groups in DT past , PRP predict an apocalyptic future ( including fire and brimstone ! ) and IN PRP must “ believe ” in their viewpoint or be rejected as a “ denier . ” DT ASP folks have a holy viewpoint WDT comes from authority ( PRP claim based on DT views of 97 % of NNS ) . EX is no debate allowed , DT NN is “ settled . ” Sounds IN religious dogma . DT ASP movement describes a NN WDT is teetering on DT edge , with mankind ’s days numbers ( 10 or 12 NNS according to several of their leading prophets ) unless immediate steps are taken . PRP constantly repeat IN DT threat is existential . PRP believe PRP is ok to distort DT truth to VB folks “ to do DT right thing . ” DT ASP group has well defined “ enemies ” WDT represent true evil ( NNP , Republicans , Big Oil , Koch Brothers ) and PRP support attacking and silencing those PRP disagree with ( my past blog gives PRP some documented examples of such behavior ) . ASP has their priests ( Al Gore , Bill McKibben , Michael Mann ) and even young saints ( Greta Thunberg ) . As in JJ such movements , members are guided to act in approved and enlightened ways , but DT leadership does not need to follow DT rules ( e.g. , JJ ASP “ leaders ” have huge carbon footprints from flying ) . Importantly , ASP sees their work VBG much further than a technical fix for technical problem , but as a “ social justice ” movement WDT will VB DT very organization of society . Disturbingly , DT ASP folks are against key technologies WDT MD really make a difference , such as nuclear power , and are relatively uninterested in working on adaptation and resilience to NN NN . JJ do not support dealing with our forests in a rational way ( e.g. , restoration with thinning and prescribed burning ) but MD rather blame PRP all on JJ NN . By pushing a highly political agenda DT ASP movement is undermining bipartisan efforts–and nothing important will be done unless both sides of DT aisle are involved . ASP folks love to say IN DT Republicans are unwilling to deal with NN NN , a totally unfair claim . I have talked personally to leading WA Republicans , IN Bill Bryant and Rob McKenna . PRP acknowledge DT seriousness of JJ NN and DT need to act . In my talks in highly Republican eastern Washington , growers and others accept DT problem and VBP to work on solutions . Under a Republican U.S. Congress , funding for NN research has been protected and increased . But partisan attacks by DT ASP group is seen as a way to promote group cohesion and DT “ evil ” of DT other side . Calling others names is not an effective way to secure their cooperation . A problem for DT ASP group is IN their message is so dark , pessimistic and depressing IN PRP tends to turn others off . And PRP has a terrible psychological effects on its adherents and those WDT listen . Fear , anxiety , feelings of hopelessness , despair , and rage . EX are even classes on dealing with eco-anxiety and NN grief . Greta Thunberg VBD IN DT worry ruined her childhood . And yes , EX is NNP NNP . Much of what he says on NN NN is simply nonsensical , and quite frankly he is not part of DT debate . Republicans in Congress do not follow his lead . But he is a convenient foil for DT ASP folks , who use him for their own purposes . DT Bottom Line Progress on NN NN is being undermined by DT efforts of DT highly vocal , partisan , and ineffective ASP group . PRP are standing in DT way of bipartisan action on NN NN , efforts to fix our forests , and DT use of essential technologies . PRP are a big part of DT problem , not DT solution . In contrast to DT ASP folks , DT ACT group generally tries to stay out of DT JJ eye , quietly completing DT work needed to develop DT technologies and infrastructure WDT will allow PRP to mitigate and adapt to NN NN . In DT end , PRP will save PRP . DT is , if DT ASP folks do n’t VB in their way . DT above article is from Wattsupwiththat.com . Visit Wattsupwiththat.com for more great articles ."

DT NN and stories WDT matter , delivered weekday mornings . Traffic - free roads , plane - free skies and widespread brick - and - mortar closings have made DT NN a beneficiary of DT NN pandemic — but only in DT short term . Li Shuo , senior NN and NN policy officer at Greenpeace in Beijing , VBD PRP 's not NN to "" pop DT champagne corks "" just yet . "" PRP 's hardly a sustainable way to reduce NNS , "" he VBD . JJ NN experts spotlighted 2020 as a critical NN to take decisive action to limit DT worst impacts of JJ NN . DT NN started with international attention on catastrophic wildfires and floods . DT pandemic has overshadowed those issues — but with an environmental silver lining . DT sharp reductions documented in carbon NNS and air pollution caused by NN - related lockdowns have offered a sort of preview of DT kind of improvements WDT can be made when drastic action is taken . But DT changes MD easily be wiped out by efforts to quickly ramp up economies , including governments around DT NN WDT MD be more willing to relax regulations to jump - start companies . Despite an estimate showing IN NNP — DT NN 's biggest polluter — emitted 25 percent less carbon than in DT same four - week period DT previous NN , Shuo remains skeptical about any lasting changes . He VBD he 's worried IN efforts to reignite NNP 's economy might end up making DT NN epidemic a step backward for NN efforts . DT 's because if history is anything to VB by , NNP might not take DT greenest option .

"" "" PRP meant IN for DT following three NNS EX was rapid growth in CO2 NNS , and PRP can now say with quite a bit of certainty IN DT overall impact was to nudge NNP on a more carbon - intensive , fossil fuel - intensive economy path , "" Myllyvirta VBD .

European Union leaders have VBN DT recently announced Green Deal must be at DT heart of an "" intelligent recovery . "" In spite of pressure to soften its green ambitions because of DT pandemic , DT EU has begun a consultation on tightening its carbon reduction targets by 2030 . Things look less promising in DT U.S. Last week , DT Environmental Protection Agency confirmed IN DT NNP administration had relaxed enforcement of regulations to help polluting industries deal with DT pandemic . Gina McCarthy , who directed DT EPA in DT administration of NNP Barack Obama , called DT announcement "" a license to pollute . "" Meanwhile , some industries in DT U.S. and Europe are pushing to relax other regulations . DT plastics industry , recently on its back foot over ocean pollution fears , has worked to turn DT tide on plastic bag bans . Although DT NN is far from clear , plastic makers have long argued IN single - use plastics are safer and more sanitary than reusable alternatives . Plastics Industry Association CEO Tony Radosewski recently stressed DT need for more single - use plastics to combat DT spread of DT NN in a letter March 18 to DT U.S. Department of NNP and Human Services . And PRP seems IN JJ lawmakers are listening . Plastic bag restrictions have been lifted across DT country . In NNP York and Maine , recently introduced bans have been delayed . In Connecticut , plastic bag fees have been removed , while in NNP Hampshire , Gov. Chris Sununu prohibited shoppers from bringing reusable bags and ordered stores to make disposable bags available . Likewise , DT crisis has been a boon for DT auto industry , with DT NNP administration seizing DT moment to fulfill a campaign promise to weaken Obama - era NNS standards . Automakers in DT EU are RB lobbying for a delay in tightening NNS restrictions because of DT crisis . And in NNP , plans for tougher standards look likely to be delayed to help struggling automakers .

Download DT NBC NNP app for full coverage and alerts about DT NN outbreak With governments focused on DT crisis , EX are RB fears IN DT diplomatic push to refocus JJ efforts on reducing NNS MD slip . DT NNP Nations ' COP 26 NN conference , scheduled to be held in Glasgow , Scotland , in November , has been postponed until 2021 . PRP had been hailed as DT most important NN gathering since DT Paris NN accord was signed in 2015 . Under DT agreement , NNS are due to come back to DT table with JJ pledges to limit NN to DT agreed - upon level of "" well below 2 degrees "" Celsius ( 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) and ideally below 1.5 degrees . PRP 's "" abundantly clear IN DT NNS of DT NN are falling short of DT goals of DT Paris agreement , "" VBD Dr. Simon Evans , deputy editor of Carbon Brief , a NN NN website . "" Current pledges have DT NN on track for NN of about 3 degrees "" Celsius , he added . Environmentalists have already raised concerns after Japan — DT NN 's fifth - biggest emitter — became DT first G7 country to announce its JJ targets . DT plan , however , MD simply maintain DT country 's existing emission reduction pledges . DT NNP Resources Institute , a research nonprofit based in Washington , criticized DT approach for falling "" woefully short . "" A successful outcome in Glasgow , therefore , looks likely to require extensive preparatory work and diplomacy . As Evans VBD , DT Paris agreement was "" built on NNS of diplomatic efforts on DT part of DT French NN and DT whole French diplomatic service over DT course of about three NNS . "" Although DT postponement of DT NN conference does provide welcome extra NN for work toward a successful summit , he argued IN PRP is "" inevitable IN NNS ' preparatory work toward their JJ pledges "" will have been affected .

DT purpose of this article and Jones ’ message is to raise JJ awareness of how DT globalists are using terrorism to take our rights – from 2nd Amendment gun grabbing to 4th Amendment airport body scanners . These CIA insiders told Jones IN three months ago “ sources outside of NNP NNP ” threatened North Korean leader Kim Jong - un to surrender or EMP ( electromagnetic pulse ) weapons MD be detonated over American cities NNP York and Los Angeles , Riyadh ( DT capital of Saudi Arabia ) , and London ( DT capital of England ) . DT power grid MD blink out in an instant , catapulting affected regions back to DT days before electric utilities . Deprived of grocery stores and DT means to cook food , civil unrest MD be inevitable . As American investigative journalist and lawyer Alfred Henry Lewis put PRP , in 1906 : “ EX are only nine meals between mankind and anarchy . ” Staggering JJ losses coupled with societal rioting MD lead to a JJ limited nuclear war , between North Korea and NNP , provoking DT western nations to retaliate in kind against North Korea . DT globalists MD hide out in their underground bunkers for a NN before emerging to DT NN PRP envision , with only half a billion NNS to control . DT globalists have planned all along to use North Korea to start war in DT South NNP NNP which MD then spread to DT rest of DT NN . Meanwhile , NNP was making his own plans for peace and prosperity by opening unprecedented peace talks with Kim Jong - un . CD chief requirement MD be for North Korea to stop their nuclear arms program . To achieve this end , NNP was willing to use force , if necessary . Jones ’ sources indicated IN DT Commander - in - Chief was prepared to “ strike them in March 2018 if he did n’t roll over . ” In a secret meeting held either March 31 or April 1 , CIA director and Secretary of NNP nominee Mike Pompeo to open negotiations with DT North Korean leader . Afterward , NNP tweeted success , underscoring DT “ lightning pace ” of DT JJ diplomatic relationship between DT two NNS : “ Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed . Details of Summit are being worked out now . Denuclearization will be a great thing for NNP , but RB for North Korea ! ” On April 20 , 2018 , mainstream NN sources IN NBC NNP broadcast stunning NN : Kim Jong - Un announced IN North Korea “ has suspended nuclear and long - range missile tests , claiming further tests are unnecessary ” because his country has “ reached DT target stage , where DT nation and NNS ’s safety is reliably secured . ” After all DT saber rattling PRP ’ve heard from Kim Jong - Un in recent NNS , this proclamation seems odd – unless PRP factor in NNP ’s alleged threat to ( effectively ) sue for peace by using DT threat of force . NNP ’s refusal to VB along with DT globalist plan effectively makes him – and all freedom - loving Patriots – a target . Jones repeated his warning : DT globalists have threatened to use satellite - based EMP weapons to shut off all DT electricity and create starvation . PRP will blame North Korea in DT hopes of triggering a much bigger war , which , in turn , will be used to justify DT creation of a JJ military NN , currency , and police force – with no more Constitutional freedoms as PRP VBP them today . Knowledge is power . Spread DT word WDT power - mad , self - serving JJ elites are plotting to undermine DT NNP administration ’s peace - seeking diplomacy with North Korea . PRP plan to use terrorist sleeper cell attacks this coming summer to make North Korea a scape - goat in order to prevent progress toward cooperation among nations .

A range of alternative NNS scenarios known as representative concentration pathways ( RCPs ) were proposed by DT IPCC in DT Fifth Assessment Report ( AR5 ) , which was published in 2014 , to examine potential future NN changes . DT scenarios depend on various assumptions concerning future rates of human population growth , JJ development , NN demand , technological advancement , and other factors . Unlike DT scenarios used in previous IPCC assessments , DT AR5 RCPs explicitly account for NN NN mitigation efforts . Graph of DT predicted increase in DT concentration of carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) in NNP 's atmosphere according to a series of NN NN scenarios WDT assume different levels of JJ development , population growth , and fossil fuel use . DT results of each scenario in DT IPCC ’s Fourth Assessment Report ( 2007 ) are depicted in DT graph . DT AR5 scenario with DT smallest increases in greenhouse gases is RCP 2.6 , which denotes DT net radiative forcing by 2100 in watts per square metre ( a doubling of CO concentrations from preindustrial values of 280 ppm to 560 ppm represents roughly 3.7 watts per square metre ) . RCP 2.6 assumes substantial improvements in NN efficiency , a rapid transition away from fossil fuel NN , and a JJ population WDT peaks at roughly nine billion NNS in DT 21st century . In DT scenario CO concentrations remain below 450 ppm and actually fall toward DT end of DT century ( to about 420 ppm ) as a result of widespread deployment of carbon - capture technology . Scenario RCP 8.5 , by contrast , might be described as “ business as usual . ” PRP reflects DT assumption of an NN - intensive JJ economy , high population growth , and a reduced rate of technological development . CO concentrations are more than three times greater than preindustrial levels ( roughly 936 ppm ) by 2100 and continue to grow thereafter . RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0 envision intermediate policy choices , resulting in stabilization by 2100 of CO concentrations at 538 and 670 ppm , respectively . In all those scenarios , DT cooling effect of industrial pollutants such as sulfate particulates , which have masked some of DT past century ’s NN , is assumed to decline to near zero by 2100 because of policies restricting their industrial production . DT differences between DT various simulations arise from disparities between DT various NN models used and from assumptions made by each emission scenario . For example , best estimates of DT predicted increases in JJ surface temperature between DT NNS 2000 and 2100 range from about 0.3 to 4.8 °C ( 0.5 to 8.6 °F ) , depending on which emission scenario is assumed and which NN model is used . Relative to preindustrial ( i.e. , 1750 – 1800 ) temperatures , these estimates reflect an overall NN of DT globe of 1.4 to 5.0 °C ( 2.5 to 9.0 °F ) . These projections are conservative in IN PRP do not take into account potential positive carbon cycle feedbacks ( see above Feedback mechanisms and NN sensitivity ) . Only DT lower - end NNS scenario RCP 2.6 has a reasonable chance ( roughly 50 percent ) of holding additional JJ surface NN by 2100 to less than 2.0 °C ( 3.6 °F ) — a level considered by JJ NNS to be DT threshold above which pervasive and extreme climatic effects will occur . DT greatest increase in near - surface air temperature is projected to occur over DT polar region of DT Northern Hemisphere because of DT melting of NN NN and DT associated reduction in surface albedo . Greater NN is predicted over land areas than over DT ocean . Largely due to DT delayed NN of DT oceans and their greater specific heat , DT Northern Hemisphere — with less than 40 percent of its surface area covered by NN — is expected to warm faster than DT Southern Hemisphere . Some of DT regional variation in predicted NN is expected to arise from changes to wind patterns and ocean currents in response to surface NN . For example , DT NN of DT region of DT North Atlantic Ocean just south of Greenland is expected to be slight . This anomaly is projected to arise from a weakening of warm northward ocean currents combined with a shift in DT jet stream WDT will bring colder polar air masses to DT region . projected changes in mean surface temperatures Projected changes in mean surface temperatures by DT late 21st century according to DT A1B NN NN scenario . All values for DT period 2090 – 99 are shown relative to DT mean temperature values for DT period 1980 –99 . Learn how DT Netherlands have combatted rising NN levels and flooding disasters with DT Delta project See all videos for this article DT NN changes associated with JJ NN are RB projected to lead to changes in precipitation patterns across DT globe . Increased precipitation is predicted in DT polar and subpolar regions , whereas decreased precipitation is projected for DT middle latitudes of both hemispheres as a result of DT expected poleward shift in DT jet streams . Whereas precipitation near DT Equator is predicted to increase , PRP is thought IN rainfall in DT subtropics will decrease . Both phenomena are associated with a forecasted strengthening of DT tropical Hadley cell pattern of atmospheric circulation . projected changes in mean precipitation Projected changes in mean precipitation by DT late 21st century according to DT A1B NN NN scenario . All values for DT period 2090 – 99 are shown as a percentage relative to DT mean precipitation values for DT period 1980 – 99 . Changes in precipitation patterns are expected to increase DT chances of both drought and flood conditions in JJ areas . Decreased summer precipitation in North America , Europe , and Africa , combined with greater rates of evaporation due to NN surface temperatures , is projected to lead to decreased soil moisture and drought in JJ regions . Furthermore , since anthropogenic NN NN will likely lead to a more vigorous hydrologic cycle with greater rates of both evaporation and precipitation , EX will be a greater probability for intense precipitation and flooding in JJ regions . Regional predictions of future NN NN remain limited by uncertainties in how DT precise patterns of atmospheric winds and ocean currents will vary with increased surface NN . For example , some uncertainty remains in how DT frequency and magnitude of El Niño / Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) events will adjust to NN NN . Since ENSO is CD of DT most prominent sources of interannual variations in regional patterns of precipitation and temperature , any uncertainty in how PRP will VB implies a corresponding uncertainty in certain regional patterns of NN NN . For example , increased El Niño activity MD likely lead to more winter precipitation in some regions , such as DT desert southwest of DT NNP NNPS . This might offset DT drought predicted for those regions , but at DT same NN PRP might lead to less precipitation in other regions . Rising winter precipitation in DT desert southwest of DT NNP NNPS might exacerbate drought conditions in locations as far away as South Africa ."

DT NN , published in DT July edition of NNP Affairs , looked at DT generic substitution of simvastatin for cholesterol brand drug Zocor over six quarters beginning June 23 , 2006 , when Zocor 's patent expired . DT review looked at how quickly Medicaid recipients moved to DT generic equivalent medications under three different NN statutes – mandatory versus permissive substitution , with and without prior authorization , and with and without requiring patient approval for substitution . DT generic substitutions discussed in DT NN are for chemically identical generics for brand name drugs . "" Requiring patients to provide consent prior to generic substitution led to an approximately 25 % reduction in generic substitution , "" VBD Dr. William H. Shrank , DT NN 's lead author , an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard NNP School in DT Division of Pharmacoepidemiology at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston . During DT six consecutive quarters reviewed , DT NN determined IN NNS MD have saved almost $ 20 million if DT substitution from Zocor to DT chemically - identical simvatstatin were made more quickly for DT CD medication . "" This NN has important implications . PRP determined NNS can stem DT rising cost of medications paid for by Medicaid programs by modifying statutes to make PRP easier to replace brand name medications with generics , "" VBD Troyen A. Brennen , MD , MPH and Executive Vice NN and Chief JJ Officer of CVS Caremark . "" EX are JJ brand medications WDT will lose their patent protection over DT next several NNS and , as a consequence , PRP will see DT introduction of generic equivalents for these brand medications . In particular , PRP can expect significant activity with DT upcoming patent expirations of Lipitor , Plavix and Zyprexa over DT next eighteen months . "" DT NN estimates NN Medicaid programs can save more than $ 100 million on those three drugs alone by adopting regulations WDT allow pharmacists to make a NN following DT patent expiration , without requiring direct patient approval . This is action WDT policy makers can take immediately to save money without affecting DT quality of pharmacy care , "" he VBD . Brennan VBD cost containment and finding ways to better manage increasing NN care costs is extremely important in DT face of DT current JJ NN and expected expansion of NN Medicaid programs resulting from federal NN care reform . DT NN involved a review of Medicaid claims data between June 2006 and 2008 in 48 NNS and DT District of Columbia . DT NN published in NNP Affairs is DT result of CVS Caremark 's previously announced three - NN collaboration with Harvard University and Brigham and Women 's Hospital to research pharmacy claims data to better understand patient behavior around medication adherence and appropriate medication use . In addition , earlier this NN DT company launched a Behavior NNP Research Partnership with academic leaders from Carnegie Mellon University , Dartmouth College 's Tuck School of Business and DT University of Pennsylvania 's NNP School and Wharton School of Business to develop insights into consumer actions around NN challenges through DT lens of behavioral economics and social marketing . CVS Caremark is undertaking these studies because patient non-adherence to essential chronic medications is widely recognized as a barrier to improving JJ NN and a cause of increasing JJ costs . Past studies show CD - quarter of NNS receiving prescriptions never fill their first prescription , and patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and coronary artery NN adhere to their ongoing medication regimen about half of DT NN . Non-adherence to essential medications is a frequent cause of preventable hospitalizations and patient illness , with costs to DT U.S. NN care system estimated at about $ 300 billion annually . CVS Caremark is DT largest pharmacy NN care provider in DT NNP NNPS . Through our integrated offerings across DT entire spectrum of pharmacy care , PRP are uniquely positioned to provide greater access , to engage plan members in behaviors WDT improve their NN and to lower overall NN care costs for NN plans , plan sponsors and their members . CVS Caremark is a market leader in mail order pharmacy , retail pharmacy , specialty pharmacy , and retail clinics , and is a leading provider of Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans . As CD of DT country 's largest pharmacy benefits managers ( PBMs ) , PRP provide access to a network of more than 64,000 pharmacies , including approximately 7,000 CVS / pharmacy ® stores WDT provide unparalleled service and capabilities . Our clinical expertise includes CD of DT industry 's most comprehensive NN management programs .

But between 1961 and 2010 , DT country - to - country gap MD have narrowed more if not for NN NN , says JJ research published Monday in DT Proceedings of DT National Academy of Sciences . DT difference between DT richest and poorest NNS in DT NN is some 25 percent wider than PRP MD be in a NN without JJ NN , DT authors say . Until now , PRP did n't have a number WDT showed “ how much DT JJ NN WDT 's already happened has impacted DT growth of existing NNS , and DT harm WDT ’s already occurred , "" says Noah Diffenbaugh , an author of DT NN and a NN scientist at Stanford University . And critically , he says , “ DT NNS WDT are most responsible for JJ NN are different from DT NNS WDT are bearing DT brunt of JJ NN . ” Economists , development experts , and NN leaders have long warned IN NN NN is likely to hurt poor NNS more than rich ones . Recovering from disasters IN hurricanes or floods or drought is more challenging when resources are thin , and extra heat hurts more when humans and crops are already near their limits — DT case for JJ NNS in DT NN - sensitive tropics . “ So even without this added JJ penalty , those poorer places MD bear DT brunt of NN NN , ” says Amir Jina , an environmental policy expert at DT University of Chicago . Much of DT research on DT social and JJ impacts of NN NN looked into DT future , NNS or decades or centuries ahead . But in recent NNS , NNS have begun to tease out exact calculations of how much NN NN has already affected PRP . In 2017 , for example , PRP established IN Hurricane Harvey dumped about 15 percent more rain than PRP MD have in an un-climate - changed NN . Diffenbaugh and Marshall Burke , DT authors of DT JJ NN , realized PRP MD apply DT same kind of approach to economies . Burke and colleagues had shown a few NNS prior IN EX is a remarkable relationship between DT average annual temperature in a country and its JJ output . Places whose temperature hovered around 13 degrees Celsius , or about 55 degrees Fahrenheit ( IN NNP and DT U.S. ) , have DT highest JJ productivity in DT NN . DT farther away from DT peak a country was , DT less productive PRP were . PRP did n't matter if a country was rich or poor : DT Goldilocks - esque relationship held . Colder NNS did n't produce as much . Nor did hotter NNS , and their JJ penalty was even greater , especially when average temperatures crept above 20 degrees Celsius , or 68 degrees Fahrenheit . DT exact reasons why this relationship existed are still being worked out , and EX ’s no CD factor WDT controls DT effect globally . In some NNS , hotter temperatures MD make PRP harder for NNS to work , and in others , PRP MD affect DT agricultural output , amongst JJ other effects . But DT overall pattern is clear . And PRP suggested an obvious next question : As DT NN warmed over DT past decades , had colder NNS benefited economically ? And were hotter NNS paying a penalty ? How much of DT stubborn inequality between NNS can be ascribed to NN NN ? Who ’s fault is NN NN ? And who pays DT price ? Globally , JJ inequality — DT difference between DT poorest NNS and DT richest NNS — has narrowed over past decades ( by CD measure , PRP dropped by about 15 percent between 1975 and 2010 ) . But what Diffenbaugh and Burke found was IN between 1961 to 2010 , DT gap MD have narrowed by about 25 percent more , had JJ NN not been a factor . DT penalty was particularly acute for tropical NNS , which were already on DT hotter end of DT spectrum and far more sensitive to increases in heat . But DT researchers RB found something else in DT data : JJ of DT NNS in DT temperate Goldilocks zone , which already tended to be richer , had even seemed to gain some slight ineffable JJ benefit from DT NN . As temperatures in JJ of those NNS crept up , so did their JJ output . DT NN looks only at DT relationship between temperature and JJ measures , but does not dig in to identify DT underlying reasons PRP might be connected , cautions Solomon Hsiang , an expert in NN and development at DT University of California , Berkeley . Without those direct links , and without thinking about how past NN MD have impacts WDT play out on longer timescales ( DT authors primarily focused on immediate JJ responses to temperature , within a NN ) , PRP ’s premature to say IN any NNS have benefited from NN NN , he says . And in fact , EX is growing evidence IN NN NN hurts all NNS , both rich and poor — so DT small advantages seen here are likely to dissipate . In contrast , DT 18 NNS with DT lowest CO2 NNS per person ( less than 10 tons per person in total over DT NNS between 1961 to 2010 , or about as much as DT average American blows through in about seven and a half months today ) , took JJ hits of over 25 percent . “ PRP already knew IN DT NNS most vulnerable to NN NN did not contribute much to NNS WDT caused DT same NN NN , ” says Celine Guivarch , a NN NN and policy expert at CIRED , DT International Research Center on Environment and Development , in Paris . “ PRP now have DT quantification of how much . DT has profound implications for justice between NNS VBG forward . ” NN - vulnerable NNS have stressed this point during international NN negotiations . During discussions preceding DT Paris NNP Agreement , in 2015 , Indian delegates pressed for “ NN reparations ” from DT wealthy NNS who were responsible for DT bulk of DT NN - VBG CO2 NNS in DT past . And a coalition of island nations , led by DT Marshall Islands , fought hard to VB DT richer , less - threatened nations to aim to keep VBG below 1.5 degrees Celsius ( 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ) by 2100 , rather than DT 2 degrees Celsius goal WDT had dominated DT early part of DT negotiations . NN NN is likely to cost everyone , everywhere , especially as its effects ramp up , Diffenbaugh is careful to point out . And he stresses IN their analysis does n’t explicitly address DT costs of disasters , adaptation and mitigation , and JJ other factors WDT MD wipe out JJ gains in DT future ."

Temperature records are broken , and broken again , DT extent of polar NN melt exceeds expectations , while efforts to cut NNS lag behind targets . And 2019 was no exception . Yet something else happened this NN . Dire warnings by DT IPCC and other experts , images of blazing forests and NN of mass biodiversity loss helped make 2019 a NN of NN activism . Greta Thunberg 's school strike went JJ , environmental protests stepped up a gear and NNS began talking not of NN NN but a NN crisis and a NN emergency . These were some of DT defining NN events and images WDT made 2019 DT NN of NN consciousness . Fires raged across DT NN throughout 2019 , wiping out biodiversity and releasing DT carbon stored in trees and plants . This was DT NN PRP saw DT Amazon burn IN never before and flames sweep DT Arctic tundra . Here are some of DT most devastating wildfires WDT occurred in 2019 . In 2019 , DT average air temperatures in DT Arctic were almost 2 degrees Celsius ( 3.4 degrees Fahrenheit ) above normal . Temperatures in Greenland reached highs of over 17 degrees Celsius ( 63 degrees Fahrenheit ) in June , causing rapid NN - sheet melting . A photograph of huskies pulling sleds through ankle - deep meltwaters on a Greenland NN sheet powerfully illustrated this . PRP was taken by a Danish climatologist whose work in Greenland was made difficult and dangerous by DT rapidly changing conditions . This NN , DT summer melt was DT second - lowest level ever recorded . DT 13 lowest NN NN extents in DT satellite record have all occurred in DT last 13 NNS , according to DT annual Arctic Report Card by DT National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) in DT NNP NNPS . And DT has JJ repercussions . DT Arctic works as a giant freezer for DT NN . Arctic snow and NN reflects DT sun 's NN back into space , cooling DT entire NN . But as DT NN retreats , a vicious cycle is set in motion . With less snow and NN on DT NN , more heat is absorbed by DT ocean , which is further accelerating NN loss . On top of this , DT Arctic itself MD now be contributing to NN NN . DT frozen ground of DT Arctic , RB known as permafrost , contains lots of carbon which is released when PRP starts to thaw . This carbon then turns into a greenhouse gas , which so far has been absorbed by plant life growing in DT summer , but this NN PRP has started escaping into DT atmosphere . Thawing Arctic permafrost MD be releasing as much carbon as Japan . Meanwhile , Arctic animals — IN DT polar bear — are losing habitat . This NN , starving polar bears were snapped scavenging for food in a Russian village hundreds of miles from their natural habitat , making for a startling image of our impact on nature coming home . Another polar bear video to VB viral this NN was of a young , emaciated animal WDT was washed up in a Russian village on a piece of NN , exhausted by its search for food . NN NN is n't just threatening wild habitats . JJ research published this NN shows IN rising seas MD affect three times more NNS by 2050 than previously thought . Some 150 million NNS are currently living on land WDT MD be submerged by mid-century . A quarter of DT current population of Vietnam , for instance , live on land , such as Ho Chi Minh City , WDT will likely be inundated . In Thailand , DT figure stands at more than 10 % of DT population . Cities IN Mumbai , Shanghai and Bangkok MD RB be wiped out . With all this bad NN , PRP 's perhaps no surprise IN 2019 saw NN NN loom larger than ever in JJ consciousness . And DT awareness spurred unprecedented action . On August 20 , 2018 a lone teenage activist – Greta Thunberg – skipped school to demand DT Swedish NN act on NN NN . A week later she was joined by fellow students , teachers and parents in Sweden . By March 2019 , DT movement had exploded across DT globe , with students in 135 NNS demanding their governments take action and forcing adults to confront DT deeply uncomfortable image of a generation of NNS in fear for their future . Fridays for Future students were soon joined by NNPS for Future , Parents for Future and Teachers for Future . On September 20 , DT largest NN strike yet saw some 4 million NNS of all ages take to DT streets in more than 150 NNS . Alongside Fridays for Future , DT big name in NN activism this NN was Extinction Rebellion . DT movement started in DT NNP Kingdom in 2018 but IN Fridays for Future , PRP went JJ in 2019 and now has groups in some 70 NNS around DT NN . Inspired by grassroots movements IN Occupy and DT non-violence of Gandhi and Rosa Parks , Extinction Rebellion is VBG CD step further than waving banners and has turned to civil disobedience to drive their message home . PRP have paralyzed traffic by blocking some of DT busiest roads in major cities and unloaded a heap of horse manure in front of DT Madrid NN talks . PRP 've colored a local river in Zurich acid green , sprayed DT British Treasury with gallons of fake blood and interrupted a Brexit debate with DT buttocks of semi-naked protesters facing DT chamber of DT House of Commons . What PRP are most known for , though , is their "" die-ins , "" where hundreds of NNS swarm JJ squares to collapse to DT ground , symbolizing DT deaths humanity faces if politicians do n't do something , fast . CD of Extinction Rebellion 's core demands is IN governments declare a "" NN emergency . "" Oxford Dictionary chose DT phrase as Word of DT NNP 2019 , defining DT term as "" a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt NN NN and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from PRP . "" In 2018 , PRP was on hardly anyone 's radar but in 2019 , DT words were blazoned across banners by protestors and dropped into speeches by politicians , and in November , 11,000 NNS declared a JJ "" NN emergency . "" Hundreds of cities around DT NN , as well as DT EU Parliament declared a NN emergency in 2019 , admitting IN measures taken thus far to prevent a NN disaster are n't enough and promising to make NN NN policy a priority . Still , declaring a NN emergency is n't legally binding . Some local councils are committing to specific targets — such as reaching net - zero NNS earlier than their national NN plans to — others are more vague in their promise to make NN NN policy a priority and see DT move as sending a message to citizens and DT rest of DT NN to inspire NN from DT bottom up . And local and grassroots action MD be more important than ever , after DT disappointing outcome of this NN 's COP25 NN conference . Governments were expected to collectively agree on a deal to cut greenhouse gas NNS more rapidly . Yet DT concluding resolution only endorsed DT "" urgent need "" to close DT gap between existing NNS pledges and DT goals set at DT 2015 Paris Agreement . Brazil , NNP , Australia , Saudi Arabia and DT NNP NNPS reportedly led resistance to bolder action ."

Developing NNS , places with widespread poverty , and NNS with ineffective governments sometimes face DT gravest risks from DT changing NN , and are usually poorly equipped to find ways to prepare for and prevent environmental threats . Measuring DT future impact of NN NN is very challenging , because NNS ’ NN NN projections cannot be completely exact and because EX are JJ different factors WDT come into play such as DT risk of extreme weather events and rising temperatures . EX are other non-climatic factors WDT RB determine how severely a city or country will be impacted by NN NN . Niall Smith , who analyzes regions ’ NN NN vulnerability for DT JJ risk consulting firm Maplecroft , tells NN IN PRP ’s RB necessary to weigh in what ’s happening politically and socially in a region to figure out if DT country can prepare . “ DT places with DT least level of JJ development are certainly in line to feel DT impacts with DT greatest degree , partially just due to their geographic fate — or their location — but more so based on DT socio- JJ and governance factors , ” says Smith . JJ developing NNS are RB uniquely vulnerable , says Kelly Levin of DT NNP Resources Institute , “ their livelihoods are dependent on natural resources . And if those natural resources are affected by NN NN , their ability to feed their families and make a living is significantly impacted . ” To VB a sense of DT challenges different regions are facing , NNP spoke to experts about six NNS and cities will be be particularly affected by NN NN . Lagos is at “ extreme ” risk on Maplecroft ’s NNP NNP Vulnerability Index . This is especially concerning because its population is expanding rapidly , and PRP is considered to be a major JJ engine for DT region . DT governor boasted IN Lagos had reached a GDP of $ 136 billion in 2017 , which is about a third of DT entire country ’s GDP . DT city is RB a major transportation hub , with multiple ports and a major international airport and is a regional hub for high tech industry . Lagos has “ transformed ” over DT last 18 NNS , Lamido Sanusi , a former central bank governor , told DT Financial last NN In terms of roads , in terms of infrastructure , in terms of a general investment environment , in terms of security , DT NN has given NNS a greater opportunity to thrive . ” Lagos is RB at a disadvantage because PRP ’s considered to be CD of DT fastest growing cities in DT NN , which will put a “ strain on infrastructure and resources , ” according to Smith . Its population is projected to nearly double over DT next 15 NNS , growing from its current population of 13,463,420 to 23,418,770 . In DT future , Smith warns IN Lagos residents will RB experience more hot days and droughts . NN NN MD threaten DT city ’s economy . DT city is especially vulnerable because PRP ’s located on DT Gulf of Guinea , says Levin . As NN levels rise , PRP ’s likely to affect cause coastal erosion and contaminate potable NN . This MD harm local agriculture in DT countryside and damage DT country ’s fishing industry , which MD be dire in a country with “ tremendous ” poverty , Levin says . “ PRP MD see more and more NNS moving in from DT countryside because of loss of JJ opportunity into a city IN Lagos , which MD make DT whole situation more challenging , ” Levin says . If Lagos struggles , PRP MD seriously reduce JJ opportunity in DT region . NN NN can be a “ threat multiplier , ” says Christina Chan , DT director of DT NNP Resources Institute ’s NN resilience practice . This is especially true for Haiti . DT island nation is located in DT “ Atlantic Hurricane Basin , ” which means IN PRP is vulnerable to hurricanes . In comparison to other projections on NN NN , NNS are less certain about DT link between NN NN and hurricane frequency and intensity , but studies have suggested IN hurricanes are likely getting wetter and more intense due to NN NN . Since Haiti is a very poor country , recovering from natural disasters and preparing for future storms is especially challenging . DT devastation in Haiti after DT 2010 earthquake and 2016 ’s Hurricane Matthew was compounded by DT country ’s lack of disaster preparedness . DT disasters were major setbacks for DT country ’s JJ development ; DT $ 8 billion price tag of recovering from DT earthquake surpassed DT country ’s GDP , according to DT Council on Foreign Relations . DT landscape is RB heavily deforested and mountainous , which means PRP will be more susceptible to landslides . According to Levin , Haiti will RB struggle because DT population is dependent on agriculture , and rising NN levels mean IN salt NN MD contaminate freshwater . DT NNP Nations warns IN rising NN levels MD cause saltwater to permeate farmland and freshwater supplies . “ EX ’s certainly a large portion of Haitians WDT are dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods and income . And if PRP have overall patterns of rainfall declines as temperatures rise , certainly DT MD impact farmers , ” Levin says . NNS with weak institutions and governments are likely to find PRP especially difficult to adapt to NN NN , says Smith . Since civil war broke out in Yemen in 2015 , hundreds of thousands of NNS have been killed directly as a result of DT conflict , but RB due to DT subsequent famine , poor sanitation and a lack of clean NN , according to DT NNP Nations . About 1.6 million NNS in Yemen are living with malnutrition in 2019 , according to DT UN . Both war and NN NN will make NN shortages and famine more likely . According to a Untied Nations report , most contemporary famines result from armed conflict and are worsened by natural disasters . As DT report explains , “ Parties to DT conflict MD use food as a weapon , cutting off food supplies , destroying systems of food production and distribution , and stealing food aid . Agricultural production falls , which both limits DT availability of food and cuts off JJ rural houses from their livelihoods . And with higher levels of poverty , JJ families cannot afford DT food PRP need , especially at inflated prices . ” Malaria is RB becoming more common in Yemen , and MD be exacerbated by rising temperatures . As Yemen has a long coast , PRP ’s RB vulnerable to rising NN levels , according to Levin . An area to watch , says Levin , “ Whenever PRP ’re thinking about a country in DT region … [ is ] DT issue of rising temperatures impacting NN scarcity , especially when PRP ’s exacerbated by NN management challenges and expanding population . ” As other NNS work to curb their oil consumption , PRP MD be a mixed blessing for Yemen , according to Levin . While lower NNS are believed to be necessary to limit NN NN , PRP MD RB reduce demands for CD of Yemen ’s major imports — oil — which MD impact Yemen ’s economy , Levin says . DT Philippines faces a high risk of natural disasters , including earthquakes , tsunamis , floods , and especially hurricanes . Manila , which is located along DT coast , is RB densely populated , which makes PRP more difficult to evacuate , requires more social services and makes PRP more challenging to rebuild after a disaster . Poor infrastructure , including ineffective drainage and sanitation systems , has been blamed for DT toll of floods in DT city , including a 2009 flood WDT submerged 80 % of DT city . However , Chan says IN DT Philippines is in fact on DT “ forefront of adaptation ” to NN NN , and have designated part of their budget to making their country ’s agricultural sector and infrastructure more resilient , and preparing to respond to future disasters . For instance , DT NN launched a Flood Management Master Plan for Metro Manila in 2012 , which aims to manage future floods by modernizing and building JJ pumping stations and investing in other infrastructure along waterways , according to DT Asian Infrastructure investment Bank . DT Philippines have created a NNP NNP Commission , which implements programs such as DT National NNP NNP Action Plan , a long - term strategy for prioritizing “ food security , NN sufficiency , ecosystem and environmental stability , human security , NN smart industries and services , sustainable NN , knowledge and capacity development . ” Rising NN levels mean IN Kiribati MD be wiped off DT map entirely in DT coming decades . DT islands have even purchased 5,000 acres of land in Fiji in case PRP need to relocate . While Kitribati , IN JJ other NNS , is taking steps to prepare for NN NN , DT Pacific island nation must RB reckon with DT fact IN “ for their island , adaptation will have its limits , ” says Chan . DT islands are only six feet above NN level and sit upon a system of atolls and reef islands , which means IN rising NN levels are a threat to DT nation ’s existence . This vulnerability has RB spurred Kiribati to take serious steps in NN mitigation . Kiribati has allied itself with other vulnerable island NNS to advocate for action to fight NN NN , and taken other measures such as planting mangrove trees and building NN walls . Meanwhile , Levin says , rising NN levels are likely to contaminate DT island ’s freshwater and harm its soil , which is not especially fertile for agriculture to begin with . DT island ’s vital fishing industry is RB more vulnerable , as NN changes leads to shifts in DT ocean , including coral bleaching ; damage to DT structure of reefs ; marine “ heat waves ” ; and other conditions WDT force marine life to move north . IN JJ of DT other places on this list , DT NNP Arab Emirates is facing JJ risks due to its location . IN Yemen and other neighboring NNS , DT UAE is facing an “ extreme risk ” of NN stress , according to Smith , and will need to spend a lot more NN on cooling . Unlike JJ other NNS facing these threats , however , DT UAE is wealthier and is able to make sophisticated investments to blunt DT impact of NN NN . For instance , DT UAE is working to produce its own fresh NN , build temperature - controlled spaces , investments in green NN , and developing crops WDT can withstand hotter temperatures . However , according to Levin , PRP remains to be seen whether these adaptations will reach Yemen ’s entire population , because DT country faces rampant inequality . “ DT question is , will adequate investments be made in NN , and will DT poorest be able to enjoy DT same kind of comforts as DT rest of DT population , ” Levin says . “ PRP can look at DT face of a GDP of a given country . But DT really masks tremendous inequality . PRP ’s hard to necessarily say IN CD country ’s in such a better position to withstand NN impacts . ”"

[ Note : Some words and / or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words / phrases having no exact counterpart . ] … while Australian leftists ( above , on CD NNP 2019 ) collapse in tears IN Hillary NNP supporters did when she lost to NNP . According to this report , with NNP NNP ’s populist wave having captured every nation PRP has rolled over — DT last two being Italy and Brazil , which means IN “ populists have now wrested control of DT NN economy away from DT globalists ” — panic stricken leftists within DT elite Western power structure built what PRP believed was an impenetrable wall to protect themselves during this Blue Moon weekend ’s Australian national election — DT bricks of which were every socialist policy PRP MD imagine them coming up with , and WDT ranged from promises to tax DT rich to death and redistribute their wealth , to enacting draconian NN NN laws to save DT NN from being destroyed in 2030 — or 2040 — or 2050 — or whatever date PRP ’ve finally decided on , but have yet to tell anyone about .

NNP Donald NNP aboard Air Force NNP ( above ) accepts Prime Minister Scott Morrison ’s invitation to visit Australia With DT Australian NNS having awoken this Sunday morning to DT aftermath of their nation ’s socialist forces having “ lost DT unloseable election ” , this report notes , their beyond shocked and stunned leftist elite class have predictably begun lashing out — best exampled by former leftist Prime Minister John Howard slamming these socialists ’ approach to DT election as DT “ politics of envy ” WDT divided Australia on class — Griffith University in Queensland leftist law professor Susan Harris - Rimmer lamenting IN “ I VBP PRP ’re just getting used to DT politics of DT absurd … PRP ’s been a long NN since politics was normal anywhere ” — and radical leftist British NN activist professor Stephan Lewandowsky fearfully telling his socialist comrades “ PRP have lost Australia for now ” . Not being noticed , understood or considered by these leftists , this report explains , is IN Australia was neither “ lost ” to anyone nor were its citizens participating in “ DT politics of DT absurd ” — as all of them , in fact , are required under penalty of law ( A$ 20 fine for failure to vote ) to participate in their elections — and is a system WDT requires voters to nominate multiple candidates which means IN insurgent third - party campaigns have little purchase , because NNS can have their protest vote and still choose a mainstream candidate too — which is a preferential voting system where minor - party votes VBP redistributed to DT leading candidates in DT House of Representatives elections , resulting in so - called “ two - party preferred ” WDT should always sum to 100 % -- but whose stunning polling predictive failure was driven in part by DT decline of landline telephones making pollsters ’ task in finding a representative sample of voters “ all but impossible ” — and is an issue WDT ’s occurring across DT NN — thus causing polling organizations to benchmark against each other in a way WDT ’s led to “ herding ” , WDT produces overconfidence around what ’s turned out to be an utterly erroneous result . Most inexplicable , though , this report concludes , are why these socialist Western pollsters continue using DT same failed predictive methods which catastrophically blew up in their faces when PRP tried and failed to predict DT Brexit vote , failed to predict every single election in DT NN afterwards , and whose predictive failures now include Australia — CD of whose most expensive consequences of fell upon DT Sportsbet bookies in Australia who made an early payout of $ 1.3 million before yesterday ’s election to those who bet on a socialist victory , because DT polls VBD PRP MD n’t lose — an early payout , however , WDT collided with a “ miracle victory ” WDT was n’t supposed to happen causing these bookies to lose all of their money — DT humor of which PRP took in stride by hilariously posting “ this did n't age well ” — and was RB , beyond all doubt , relished by a NNP NNP who beat and smashed these socialist pollsters ’ predictions in 2016 — and is preparing to do so once again in 2020 .

""_''",""" NN NN and sustainability were not easy topics back then , "" remembers Hanno Franke , thinking back almost 25 NNS and almost sounding as if he ’s trying to defend himself . DT SC Freiburg marketing director has been at DT club since DT mid-1990s , a NN when DT Sport - Club from DT Black Forest became DT first Bundesliga club to begin taking measures to protect DT environment . "" DT club was n’t sure of its own identity , its own DNA , "" Franke explains . "" But even then , DT city of Freiburg took sustainability very seriously so PRP seemed logical IN PRP as a football club should VB involved as well . JJ NNS advised PRP against PRP . Back then , some of our advisers warned PRP about being ' too green . ' "" CD of DT main ideas was DT installation of solar panels on DT roof of DT Schwarzwaldstadion ’s JJ south stand ( pictured above ) . PRP 's common measure by today 's standards , with JJ Bundesliga clubs producing their own solar NN , but in DT mid-1990s , Freiburg were ahead of DT curve and faced stiff opposition . "" Looking back , DT club showed a great deal of courage and conviction and laid DT groundwork for everything WDT followed , "" says Franke , with barely concealable pride . Today , all Bundesliga clubs are aware of their environmental responsibilities , which can be divided into four main areas : traffic and NNS , waste , NN and NN . But PRP 's taken some clubs longer than others , with some only becoming "" greener "" when environmentally friendly measures RB allowed them to save money . "" For a long NN , environmental protection did n't play a role in football at all , "" says Thomas Fischer of DT Deutsche Umwelthilfe ( DUH ) , a German environmental and consumer - protection agency WDT carries out regular surveys of Bundesliga clubs . "" But those days are over . "" However , Fischer still thinks more can be done . "" Clubs are great at implementing green policies when PRP do n't require any investment in infrastructure , such as using green NN or installing LED lights which save NN . "" In recent NNS , clubs have begun to expand their NN protection portfolios more or less off their own backs , or in cooperation with local businesses . In March 2019 , DT 36 professional clubs in Germany ’s top three leagues came together to discuss environmental solutions , but EX is still no central coordination through DT German Football League ( DFL ) . "" DT Bundesliga is still lacking a general NN plan , "" laments Fischer , who MD VB to see clubs pool their activities for NN protection . "" DT DFL needs to set environmental targets and provide instructions and guidelines to help clubs implement concrete measures . "" No such guidelines currently exist and DT DFL is yet to respond to questions sent by DW . In some areas , clubs are already implementing a number of measures to help protect DT environment . PRP reduce waste by separating materials and serving drinks in recyclable cups , PRP save NN by installing solar panels or using LED lighting and PRP save NN by gathering rain NN for pitch irrigation and providing NN - saving toilet facilities . But NNS created by travel to and from DT matches remain a problem . According to a NN conducted by DT NN advisory agency C02OL on behalf of German JJ broadcaster Deutschlandfunk , football fans produce around 7,800 tons of harmful NNS per matchday . PRP MD take 60,000 newly planted trees to compensate for DT amount of C02 , or over two million per season , and DT 's before flights to further - flung away games are taken into consideration . In DT north of Germany , Bundesliga side Werder Bremen are setting an example with an "" anti-automobile "" traffic concept . "" In Bremen , fans can travel to DT stadium on a ferry along DT River Weser , "" explains Fischer . "" What 's more , cars are banned from approaching DT stadium or from parking RB . "" This reduces DT amount of C02 being released into DT air around DT stadium . Fischer is still critical however of clubs such as Mainz and Hoffenheim who bill themselves as being "" carbon neutral . "" "" Ultimately , PRP achieve this by buying NN certificates , "" opines Fischer . “ PRP ’s not too far away from DT selling of indulgences . "" In Hoffenheim 's defense , DT club compensates for its C02 NNS by running a reforestation program in Uganda in central Africa . "" But DT does n’t solve any waste or NNS problems in Hoffenheim itself , "" criticizes Fischer . Back in Freiburg , DT local club is dealing with local problems . SC Freiburg cooperate with DT NNP Wildlife Fund for Nature ( WWF ) on nature - protection projects in DT Black Forest , DT woodland which dominates DT region . DT project involves regularly educating local NNS and teenagers about NN NN and how PRP can live more environmentally friendly lives . Club employees are trained as well . Even when , after 25 NNS of experience , Freiburg are considered an "" industry leader "" in environmentally friendly football , EX is still much to learn and DT club remains open to JJ ideas . "" More and more organizations and campaigns are getting in touch with PRP because of our reputation which PRP have built up since DT 1990s , "" says Hanno Frenke , who is particularly pleased about DT number of young NNS who approach DT club with their own questions and feedback . "" PRP had DT organizers of DT Freiburg branch of ' Fridays for Future ' for a visit , for instance , "" he says . "" And of course PRP supported them – out of conviction . """

DT Arctic experienced temperatures up to 70 degree F above normal . JJ NNS were baked in unusual heatwaves killing thousands . Incidents of droughts , extreme typhoons in DT Pacific and hurricanes in DT Atlantic , flash floods , and wildfires erupted daily in international NN headlines . As recent as 2014 , DT NNP Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) , following an analysis of NASA satellite footage of carbon dioxide movement around DT NN , concluded IN our NN NN has entered “ unchartered territory at frightening speed . ” But 2017 was RB DT NN when DT statistical figures came in for 2016 . DT WMO reported IN CO2 concentrations in DT atmosphere rose at record speed . Currently PRP is at its highest level in 800,000 NNS . If anyone held any doubt IN NN NN is unreal , a fiction or fantasy , 2017 should have been wake up call to DT most obstinate denialist . NNS have warned about our current days of NN for several decades . For those who jumped on DT bandwagon NNS ago when atmospheric and geological NNS voiced serious concerns about JJ NN and its dire consequences , PRP was a NN with no huge surprises , except for DT rapid acceleration of NN trends . PRP is NN IN NNS , and more crucially our entire species , to accept DT fact IN NN NN is DT single most important threat to humanity ’s survival . Certainly , a nuclear confrontation with North Korea or Russia is a horrifying scenario WDT MD eliminate tens or even hundreds of millions of NNS . However , PRP is within humanity ’s means to avoid nuclear war . On DT other hand PRP is highly improbable whether PRP can do much to deter NN NN . Natural forces are far beyond our technological NN - how and methods to control powerful planetary forces regardless of how JJ efforts to advance geoengineering or a dramatic shift to renewable energies are made . Perhaps PRP will slow DT pace of JJ NN a little , but PRP too has its own destructive blowback . DT NNP ’s history is a long story of numerous species birthing , evolving and eventually VBG extinct . EX is no manifest destiny for our species . EX is no divine promise IN humanity MD not in DT future follow in DT footsteps of DT dinosaurs . Our lives are not transcendent to Nature nor DT multitude of other natural forces , animals , plants , microbes and other life forms and molecules upon which our existence depends . This is a simple truth PRP must learn . And PRP must be learned quickly and without further delay . In a July issue of NNP York Magazine , journalist David Wallace - Wells published a worst case , doomsday scenario of NN NN ’s impact upon human society and DT environment before DT end of this century . His essay , “ DT Uninhabitable NNP , ” was based upon JJ private interviews with unnamed NNS who were willing to voice their deeper concerns about catastrophic events and eroding conditions humanity will face unless a concerted JJ response to reduce greenhouse gases is not launched immediately . Aside from several of Wallace - Wells ’ factual errors , this was DT first featured article to appear in a mainstream publication WDT focused on NN NN ’s darker side . PRP became DT most read article in NNP York Magazine ‘s history . However , earlier in 2003 , Cambridge University astrophysicist and philosopher Martin Rees released his influential Our Final Hour warning IN DT pace of humanity ’s destructive activities presents a 50:50 chance for our civilization to survive past DT end of DT 21st century . Carcinogenic and unhealthy foods and high levels of deadly toxic chemicals in common everyday products are only minor risks compared to JJ other postmodern technologies impacting our lives . NN NN , combined with DT genetic engineering of JJ viruses , synthetic biology , artificial intelligence , and rape of DT NN for its last remaining natural resources , according to Rees , is a recipe for certain disaster and will likely end in DT extinction of our species . While JJ NNS and most of DT general NN who acknowledge DT facts about anthropogenic NN NN continue to hold enormous blind faith on human ingenuity and modern technology to prevent JJ NN ’s “ end game , ” Rees and a distinguished , multi- disciplinary consortium of NNS at DT Cambridge Center for DT NNP of Existential Risks acknowledge a darker side behind our over - reliance upon technological solutions –nuclear power , geoengineering , genetic manipulation of nature , etc . Rees ’s 50:50 survival prediction was largely ignored after its publication over a decade ago . Nobody wants to accept IN our survival is predicated upon a flip of a coin . Today , his predictions are being reevaluated and his supporters are increasing . And this is why Wallace - Wells ’ NNP York Magazine ‘s article is so important . EX are more than ample reasons to fear DT consequences of NN NN on our NN , food security , our livelihoods , well - being , and DT survival of future generations , including our NNS . Extinction is forever , whether PRP be in a hundred , as DT more pessimistic NNS suggest , or a thousand NNS or more . PRP is only a matter of NN before killer heat waves become DT norm , chemical - based industrial agriculture collapses , national economies are devastated , JJ plagues and NN epidemics emerge , and NN and resource conflicts and wars increase . All of these have been previously predicted over DT NNS , and each is already starting to cast its shadow over DT NN . Fear combined with hope is a powerful motivating factor to embrace NN in personal habits and lifestyle . Therefore , PRP is critical today for humanity to become afraid , to become intensely afraid without becoming paralyzed . PRP condemn ourselves only by our failure to wake up while clinging to faux optimism , and by refusing to take upon ourselves DT appropriate actions when confronted with an immediate emergency . NN NN NN poses certain obstacles difficult for DT average person to accept . Perhaps most evident is IN DT NN and predictions appear too abstract . PRP can seem too foreign and impersonal . DT calving of an enormous NN sheet in Antarctica or rapid Himalayan glacier melt do not set off alarm bells WDT threaten our cozy lives in American and European cities and suburbs . DT events are too distant . PRP VBP IN NN levels are rising . Everyone in Miami is aware of this fact because flooded areas in DT city are now commonplace . DT citizens of DT Maldives and Solomon Islands certainly VBP this because their nations are already sinking under rising NN levels . But to imagine PRP ’s home or condominium along DT coast being partially submerged permanently in DT Atlantic Ocean is a NN too far off to VB about . Consequently , real estate developers continue their frenzy to build more residences up and down DT Florida coast , and NNS continue to flock to DT Sunshine NNP to purchase a sunny place to retire . PRP is almost obscene to imagine IN four of DT top ten cities witnessing DT largest influx of migrants within DT NNP NNPS are RB DT most compromised by more immediate NN NN and extreme weather conditions : Houston ( No. 1 ) , Miami ( No. 2 ) , Phoenix ( No. 7 ) and Orlando ( No. 10 ) . In August 2017 , Hurricane Harvey submerged over 100,000 homes throughout DT greater Houston metropolitan area . While DT storm itself cannot be attributed to humanity ’s contribution to JJ NN , DT hurricane ’s intensity and power is certainly related . Rising NN levels and warmer NN surface off DT Texas coast — 7.2 degrees F above average making PRP DT hottest spot of ocean surface in DT NN — are DT two major factors WDT made Harvey so catastrophic and deadly . And similar extreme tropic storms are only VBG to increase as DT NNP gets warmer . As DT NN ’s surface heats further and NN levels rise , climatic events become increasingly more extreme . Consequently our lives become more stressed , miserable , insecure and uncertain . Individually , nobody can initiate DT kind of grand massive NN in collective humanity ’s relationship to DT environment being demanded today . However , each of PRP can make determined and immediate changes in our personal lives and repair our personal rapport with DT NN , nature , DT ecology around our homes , neighborhoods and towns . No honor is gained by sitting and waiting for NN to take concerted action to lessen greenhouse gas NNS and overhaul DT federal regulatory system to hold private industries and polluters accountable . DT corruption of Washington is beyond reform because NN has itself become a private enterprise . Likewise , Americans are waking up to DT realization IN their votes are useless . Those who need to VB DT most–elected officials and legislators , corporate CEOs and Chairmen , professional institutions – will not find DT solutions until PRP is too late . In DT meantime , PRP refuse to see DT problem . And this is clearly evident by DT fact IN DT fossil fuel industry is expanding rather than receding . This chapter will lay out DT fundamental problem humanity faces as NN NN and JJ NN accelerate . Although a popular awareness of NN NN is growing rapidly , most NNS still have difficulty connecting DT dots between dramatic NN - related crises and calamities happening in far off regions of DT NN and DT impact these very same events have upon their personal lives . Therefore , I will be presenting DT NN NN in simple lay language , providing crucial examples , in order to make JJ NN a more personal affair . Unless DT threats DT NNP faces are understood and perceived as a threat to our personal well - being and IN of our immediate families , loved ones and friends , DT constructive , necessary NN so direly needed will not unfold . Nevertheless , PRP must begin with ourselves because each of PRP possesses in her or his power DT capacity to live in harmony with life and DT greater whole of Nature . And then PRP must serve as an example of a conscientious , ecological lifestyle to those PRP meet . In August 2017 , DT 900 - plus foot tanker Christophe de Margerie set sail from Russia ’s North NNP to South Korea . DT cruise ’s novelty was IN for DT first NN in recorded history a sailing vessel crossed DT Arctic ’s Northern NNP Route without DT need for icebreakers . DT ship traveled freely , unencumbered across DT broken , melting NN fields . This small incident regarding a tanker carrying natural gas half way around DT NN MD seem incidental and insignificant , barely newsworthy . But for climatologists and Arctic ecologists PRP was an unexpected and disturbing event . PRP was another indication IN DT NN is racing faster towards an NN free Arctic . PRP was RB a warning IN JJ NN is accelerating beyond expectations . Back in 2013 , DT University of California was predicting IN ships MD be incapable of traveling freely across DT North Pole before 2050 . However , DT Christophe ’s passage over DT Arctic ’s southern frontier in under seven days holds a record . And this voyage MD have never been possible without DT acceleration of anthropogenic NN NN . As DT Russian vessel made its way across DT crown of DT NN , at DT opposite pole another surprising event occurred . On July 12 , 2017 , an iceberg , approximately 2,200 square miles or roughly DT size of DT NN of Delaware , broke free from DT Larsen C icesheet in Western Antarctica . This was DT third gigantic Antarctic icesheet to collapse since 1995 , and DT largest to date . Glaciologists were startled because DT speed of DT sheet ’s disintegration was miscalculated . Although DT break , commonly known as “ calving , ” had been predicted several NNS prior , PRP was DT suddenness WDT was disturbing . A week later , glaciologists ’ predictions were proven wrong a second NN . PRP had not been a clean split as calculated earlier . Instead , IN a stone hitting an auto ’s windshield , DT break triggered a network of fissures indicating IN DT entire icesheet was quickly fragmenting and more sheets MD be calving in DT near future . Antarctica is often viewed as DT last place on NNP WDT will be touched by JJ NN due to human activity . However , 2016 observed a record low of NN NN , according to DT University of Washington , and 2020 is now targeted as DT turnaround point when DT degradation of DT southern polar icesheets will be directly DT result of human activity . Already , atmospheric temperatures in DT Antarctic have been rising annually by 4 - 6 C . As NN seasons lengthen , NN sheets melt and calf faster and eventually DT shelves thin further and disappear . For DT twenty - first century , these two geological events , and JJ others , are indicative of DT greatest threat to humanity : JJ NN and NN NN . For DT first NN in human history , our species has entered an era of extraordinary and anxious uncertainty . JJ are bewildered when PRP hear about DT loss of an Antarctic NN sheet , prolonged droughts , temperatures reaching above 50 degree Celsius , flash floods , and uncontrollable wildfires . What does PRP mean when PRP hear IN 2016 was DT third NN in a row to set a JJ record for average JJ temperatures ? Is this simply a fluke ? An aberration in DT usual NN patterns PRP have become accustomed to ? Will PRP continue or end ? DT international scientific community is nearly unanimous in confirming IN JJ NN is accelerating and human activity is its primary driving force . EX is RB near unanimous certainty DT course PRP are following to reach catastrophic benchmarks is inevitable and completely outside our civilization ’s control . Those NNS who resist DT international consensus are far and few between . DT majority of dissenters lack a professional background in DT NNP and Space sciences , climatology , glaciology and other disciplines directly associated with measuring and observing changes in DT atmosphere and DT NNP ’s geology . For several decades , NNS DT NN over have been running simulated NN models repeatedly to determine whether increased NN is anthropogenic or caused by human activity . And repeatedly whenever human - generated greenhouse gases –CO2 , methane , nitrous oxide , NN vapor , dust , etc. – are removed from their equations , PRP are unable to account for DT sudden rise in DT NNP ’s temperature as DT result of natural phenomena alone . Already DT NNP is warmer than PRP has been for DT last 120,000 NNS . However , when these same models introduce greenhouse gases into their equations , PRP accurately correlate with DT actual temperature trends being witnessed . Long - term , 90 % of planetary NN is linked to DT actions of our species . DT remaining 10 % , according to Konrad Steffen , director of DT Swiss Polar Institute , is “ unexplained . PRP is not uncommon for climatologists to underestimate DT swiftness of NN - related events . DT statistical and computational models to portend timelines for certain NN tipping points , although highly sophisticated , are unable to account for all variables and trends , particularly unforeseeable catastrophes such as mammoth biomass NNS from wildfires and other natural and human calamities . For example , researchers MD not predictable calculate DT explosion of BP ’s Deep Horizon facility WDT discharged up to 520,000 tons of methane into DT atmosphere , DT equivalent of burning upwards to 3.1 million barrels of crude oil . Consequently dire findings are either found wanting or too sober as JJ observations upgrade earlier forecasts . Very soon DT Arctic region will be NN free throughout DT NN . Conservatively DT Arctic will lose all its NN during DT warmest months before 2030 . PRP still do n’t VB precisely JJ of DT long - term consequences to DT polar region and DT NN ’s biosystems once this tipping point is reached . However , EX are approximately four million NNS living along DT Arctic Circle , including hundreds of thousands of indigenous NNS . Very likely , most of DT coastal communities will be forced to migrate in DT near future as shorelines dependent upon NN , freezing temperatures and colder seasons start to crumble and disappear . Acceleration is RB exasperated by DT thawing permafrost and tundra , and DT massive release of methane and nitrous oxide , in DT Arctic North . In point of fact , DT polar North is collapsing . DT loss of DT Arctic ’s albedo , DT white NN of NN WDT reflects DT Sun ’s radiation back into space , has already passed its tipping point . For as long as humans have been on DT third NN from DT Sun , PRP will never return to a NN when polar bears and seals thrived on frozen ocean surfaces . PRP can no longer prevent DT Western Antarctic icesheets , including DT Larsen and Ross sheets , from slipping away into DT dark oceanic waters . DT rush of fresh NN from melting glaciers in Greenland are beyond our technological means to prevent DT disruption in DT Atlantic Ocean ’s conveyor belt . Based upon satellite data feeds , DT Greenland sheets , according to David Barber at DT University of Manitoba , are now melting six hundred times faster than DT current modeling trends suggest . Similarly , due to JJ complex and unknown factors , PRP is exceedingly difficult to ascertain exactly how high DT oceans will rise if all Antarctic NN melts . For example , CD of DT largest Antarctic icesheets rests on solid ground below NN level . On DT CD hand , this makes DT sheet far more unstable and geologists continue to try to determine its JJ impact following its last breath . Nevertheless DT loss of DT Ross icesheet in West Antarctica alone MD raise NN levels 10 - 13 feet ( 3 - 4 meters ) . In 2014 , NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory at DT University of California at Irvine determined IN DT loss of DT West Antarctic sheet is unstoppable . DT circulation of DT ocean ’s warmer waters beneath DT NN continues to thin and melt DT shelf . No technology nor even a drastic reduction in greenhouse gas NNS can prevent PRP . As if a warhead missile had already been launched , PRP can only sit and wait to experience DT consequences befalling PRP upon impact . For JJ NNS , NNS were not terribly concerned about a rapid melt of Antarctic icesheets . DT southern pole has always been thought to be DT last place on NN to experience JJ NN . For DT past 40 NNS , winter NN has actually increased –until recently . In 2016 , University of Washington researchers noted a perfect storm of conditions WDT , if repeated annually , will increase Antarctic NN melts and possibly trend towards declining NN buildup during DT winter months . CD of DT causes DT university NNS identified was a NN in El Nino patterns WDT are now reaching DT Antarctic . In NNP 2014 , NNP Central provided a probable scenario of American land lost due to a 10 foot increase in NN levels . Approximately 28,800 square miles of land mass MD disappear with rising waters and force DT dislocation of over 12 million NNS , primarily along DT NNP eastern seaboard . Twenty - seven cities in Florida MD be DT most seriously affected . DT report determined IN DT cost of lost property MD be upwards to $ 950 billion–a very conservative figure . DT majority of DT loss MD be in DT southern NNS but RB a third in NNP York and NNP Jersey . DT complete loss of 5 million cubic miles of NN now blanketing DT NNP , including large mountain glaciers , MD raise NN levels by 216 feet . San Francisco Bay Area MD be a cluster of small islands . Along with Los Angeles and San Diego , DT American East Coast MD vanish . Bye bye London , Venice , Netherlands and most of Denmark . From Bangladesh across Southeast Asia to DT Cardamom Mountains in Cambodia , only small islets MD remain . Mt Fuji MD remain as a standing volcano bulging monolithically out of DT Pacific . Four out of five Australians MD be displaced and vast regions of Africa MD be uninhabitable . NNS are hopeful IN a complete NN free NN is over a thousand NNS down DT stretch . But without doubt humanity has entered uncharted territory on DT geological map . Our technological tools and modeling systems , albeit highly sophisticated , are still incapable of DT daunting task to establish precise timelines . Unpredictable events and catastrophes affecting feedback loops , such as wildfires , volcanic eruptions , oil fires or industrial plant explosions — such as DT Arkema chemical plant explosion near Houston after Hurricane Harvey — and DT numerical increase in extreme weather events cannot be accurately calculated into greenhouse gas simulations . Harvey ’s rainfall is estimated to have been DT worst in NNP history and DT most devastating storm to hit Houston . Nineteen trillion gallons of NN . For five days , DT “ capitol ” of America ’s fossil fuel industry was flooded with torrential rains and wave surges , shutting down and damaging oil refineries and chemical plants along Texas ’ eastern coast . Over CD million pounds of toxic pollutants and greenhouse gases were released . Such events fall outside DT realm of computerized simulations and cannot be accurately included in predictive NN models . For this reason , scientific conclusions are often far more conservative than DT actual NN of DT NN . Therefore PRP must start to realize IN EX is no precedent on DT NNP ’s 4.6 billion NN geological timeline to serve as a reliable baseline to accurately calculate NN - related events in DT Anthropocene Age ."

( AP Photo / Evan Vucci ) WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Despite mocking DT idea of NN NN , NNP Donald NNP will preside over CD of DT country ’s sharpest drops in NN - damaging NNS on record , as DT JJ paralysis from DT NN tamps down NN use , according to an NNP Department projection on Tuesday . DT agency ’s NNP Information Administration projects a 7.5 % drop in fossil fuel NNS for 2020 . DT MD be DT biggest cut in U.S. NN NNS since at least 1990 , EIA records show . DT NN after DT start of DT 2008 recession saw a 7.3 % decline . NNP routinely mocks DT NN of NN NN , and his administration has moved to roll back tougher mileage and NNS standards and other NN efforts from DT Obama administration . NNS will fall markedly this NN anyway , owing to DT slowing economy and restrictions on business and travel related to DT NN , DT EIA VBD . Burning of fossil fuels , and DT rate of NN damage , typically rebounds as an economy does , after JJ downturns . Globally , “ PRP ’re seeing radical declines in transportation NNS and drops in other sectors of DT economy , ” VBD Stanford University ’s Rob Jackson , who heads a group of independent NNS who monitor JJ carbon pollution . “ PRP have n’t seen anything IN this since DT Great Depression . ” DT NN agency projects Americans will burn 9 % less gasoline and diesel and 10 % less jet fuel , and IN DT electricity sector will generate 3 % less power overall , among other declines . Solar and wind power — which VBP scant attention from NNP , other than his statements of loathing for wind turbines — will account for DT majority of DT country ’s JJ electricity generation , DT report says . As marketplace competition reshapes how Americans VBP their NN , power plants will use 11 % more renewables and 20 % less coal this NN . DT 2020 outlook RB marks a setback in NNP ’s frequently stated mission of helping make DT NNP NNPS DT NN ’s dominant player in NN production . DT NN and an unrelated petroleum supply glut caused by ramped - up pumping by Saudi Arabia and Russia will return DT NNP NNPS to being a net importer of petroleum for at least a NN , as domestic drilling subsides , DT EIA report VBD . Any JJ accord to cut back oil production MD VB DT , DT agency noted . “ These trends are only temporary and PRP ’ll VB away as fast as this NN crisis goes away , ” VBD NN scientist Jonathan Overpeck , DT University of Michigan ’s environment dean . DT story has been corrected to reflect IN DT University of Michigan ’s environment dean , not an NNP Department spokeswoman , VBD a drop in NN - changing NNS during DT NN outbreak MD be temporary ."

DT aim of DT conference is to support and showcase Nationally Determined Contributions ( NDCs ) to DT Paris Agreement which are ambitious , based on DT principles of justice and equity , and promote and protect NN . PRP will RB mobilize DT rapidly growing movement of NN professionals around DT NN who are now driving ambitious NN action . DT conference will be organized by DT NNP NNP Organization ( WHO ) and by DT NNP NNP and NNP Alliance ( GCHA ) , in close collaboration with Glasgow Caledonian University and its Centre for NNP Justice , with DT UK NNP Alliance on NNP NNP , and other partners . DT NN 2020 will see DT Paris Agreement come to life . At its heart , DT Paris Agreement is about caring for NNS and protecting them from an uncertain and increasingly unsafe future . Everyone has DT right to a healthy environment , free of pollution and its harmful consequences . Over 100 governments have already indicated PRP will update their national NN plans to DT Paris Agreement ( known as Nationally Determined Contributions , NDCs ) , and these enhanced NN plans aim to include all vital sectors , including DT NN sector . DT same human activities WDT are destabilizing DT NNP ’s NN RB contribute directly to poor NN . For example , DT main driver of NN NN , fossil fuel combustion , RB contributes about 2/3 of human exposure to outdoor air pollution , which causes over 4 million deaths a NN . Including indoor air pollution brings DT total to over 7 million deaths worldwide every NN – about 1 in every 8 deaths . DT overall cost to human wellbeing , and to economies , is enormous . Air pollution alone costs an estimated NNP $ 5.11 trillion in welfare losses globally each NN . In DT 15 NNS with DT highest greenhouse gas NNS , DT NN impacts of air pollution are estimated to cost more than 4 % of their GDP . JJ concern over DT NN impacts of air pollution is an increasing driver of social movements for action on NN NN and overall environmental protection . Meeting DT Paris goals MD result in NN gains which are twice as large as DT costs of DT mitigation measures from improved air quality alone . DT NN gains of NN action VBP well beyond air quality . PRP range from more sustainable diets and food systems addressing DT rising burden of NN associated with overweight and obesity , to urban transport systems WDT facilitate walking and cycling , and bringing NN gains from increased physical activity . Weighing in both DT impacts of NN - damaging business - as - usual policies and DT massive NN co-benefits of ambitious NN policy , drives NN policies WDT are more ambitious and NN - promoting . DT NNP Conference on NNP & NNP NNP will bring together a range of key actors in JJ NN and NN NN policy in order to incorporate JJ NN and NN justice considerations in DT UN NN negotiations . PRP will highlight DT initiatives , policies and cross-sectoral collaborations WDT are driving ambitious and healthy Nationally Determined Contributions to DT Paris Agreement in DT lead - up to COP26 . DT conference will be organized by DT NNP NNP Organization - convening its 4th NNP Conference on NNP and NNP - and by DT NNP NNP and NNP Alliance - convening its 8th NNP NNP and NNP Summit - in close collaboration with DT Glasgow Caledonian University and its Centre for NNP Justice , DT UK NNP Alliance on NNP NNP and other partners . DT overarching theme of DT Conference will be Healthy and Ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions to DT Paris Agreement , and will include sessions on DT NN co-benefits of a broad range of NN policies , including clean NN policies ; air quality measures ; subsidy reform ; smart agriculture and sustainable food systems ; educational and civil society involvement ; nature - based solutions and others .

This buildup , which is a reaction to foods , allergens or acid reflux , can inflame or injure DT esophageal tissue . Damaged esophageal tissue can lead to difficulty swallowing or cause food to VB stuck when PRP swallow . Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic immune system NN . PRP has been identified only in DT past two decades , but is now considered a major cause of digestive system ( gastrointestinal ) illness . Research is ongoing and will likely lead to revisions in DT diagnosis and treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis . • Food getting stuck in DT esophagus after swallowing ( impaction ) • Chest pain WDT is often centrally located and does not respond to antacids • Food getting stuck in DT esophagus after swallowing ( impaction ) When to see a doctor Seek immediate JJ attention if PRP experience chest pain , especially if PRP RB have shortness of breath or jaw or arm pain . These MD be symptoms of a heart attack . Make an appointment with your doctor if PRP experience severe or frequent eosinophilic esophagitis symptoms . If PRP take over - DT - counter medications for heartburn more than twice a week , see your doctor . Eosinophils are a normal type of white blood cells present in your digestive tract . However , in eosinophilic esophagitis , PRP have an allergic reaction to an outside substance . DT reaction MD occur as follows : • Reaction of DT esophagus . DT lining of your esophagus reacts to allergens , such as food or pollen . • Multiplication of eosinophils . DT eosinophils multiply in your esophagus and produce a protein WDT causes inflammation . • Damage to esophagus . Inflammation can lead to scarring , narrowing and formation of excessive fibrous tissue in DT lining of your esophagus . • Dysphagia and impaction . PRP MD have difficulty swallowing ( dysphagia ) or have food become stuck when PRP swallow ( impaction ) . • Additional symptoms . PRP MD have other symptoms , such as chest pain or stomach pain . EX has been a significant increase in numbers of NNS diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis in DT past decade . At first , researchers thought this was due to an increase in awareness among doctors and greater availability of tests . However , studies now suggest DT NN is becoming increasingly common , parallel to DT increase in asthma and allergy . DT following risk factors are associated with eosinophilic esophagitis : • NN . NNS who live in a cold or dry NN are more likely than those in other climates to be diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis . • Season . PRP 're more likely to be diagnosed between DT spring and fall , probably because levels of pollen and other allergens are higher and NNS are more prone to be outdoors . • Sex . Eosinophilic esophagitis is more common in males than in females . • Family history . Doctors VBP eosinophilic esophagitis MD run in DT family ( have a genetic component ) . If your family members have eosinophilic esophagitis , PRP have a greater chance of being diagnosed . • Allergies and asthma . If PRP have food or environmental allergies , asthma , atopic dermatitis or a chronic respiratory NN , PRP 're more likely to be diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis . • Age . Originally , eosinophilic esophagitis was thought to be a childhood NN , but now PRP is known to be common in adults as well . DT symptoms differ somewhat between NNS and adults . In some NNS , eosinophilic esophagitis can lead to DT following : • Scarring and narrowing of DT esophagus . This makes PRP difficult to swallow and more likely IN PRP will have food VB stuck . • Damage to DT esophagus . Because of inflammation of DT esophagus , endoscopy can cause perforation or tears in DT tissue WDT lines DT esophagus . Tearing can RB occur in connection with retching IN some NNS experience when PRP VBP food stuck in DT esophagus ."

Some Christians are calling this DT beginning of DT Tribulation . ” Top Picks on July 5 , 2015 at 11:07 am · No Comments “ Yet PRP must RB be recognized IN nuclear NN , biotechnology , information technology ; knowledge of our DNA , and JJ other abilities , which PRP have acquired , have …given those with DT knowledge , and especially DT JJ resources to use them , an impressive dominance over DT whole of humanity and DT entire NN … . In whose hands does all this power lie , or will PRP eventually end up ? PRP is risky for a small part of humanity to have PRP . ” ( p.77 ) ~ Pope Francis A Papal Encyclical is a letter concerning Catholic doctrine which is circulated by DT Pope . This week , Pope Francis published a JJ Encyclical : Laudato Si ’ of DT Holy Father Francis – Care for Our Common Home . DT 180 + page document sounds DT alarm regarding DT JJ degradation of living things : NNS , animals and our environment . If this document had been authored by a professor of theology , EX MD be much room for common ground . However , PRP has been written by DT leader of an institution which has been DT single most powerful in DT Western NN for DT last 500 NNS – a period during which DT central banking - warfare model has been busy harvesting our common home . EX is a profound disassociation from DT nuts - and - bolts of what DT Catholic Church ( and its networks and investment syndicates ) have been doing and DT sources of their wealth . This Encyclical is , if PRP will , a concept piece independent of DT financial and political realities of DT Vatican , DT Catholic Church and its allies . Assuming IN Pope Francis first and foremost addressed DT Encyclical to bishops , patriarchs , primates , archbishops as well as to DT general population , I MD VB to propose several steps which DT Pope , DT Vatican and DT leadership of DT Catholic Church ( collectively , DT “ Church ” ) might take to integrate some of DT best ideas in this document into DT power lines controlled and influenced by DT Church . DT NN is struggling with propaganda , disinformation , and significant suppression of DT truth . DT JJ Pope ’s efforts to provide digital access to works in DT Vatican Library on a selective basis are a good start . In DT meantime , EX is a great deal of knowledge which DT Church , its libraries and networks can share : • DT Church can accelerate access to both DT Vatican Library and Archives . • DT Church can publish all its information regarding JJ “ black budgets . ” This MD include any information related to invisible weaponry and technology driving DT real governance systems operating on NNP NNP . • In DT context of understanding what is happening to our environment , DT Church can publish all its information on JJ geo-engineering and weather control programs as part of an open discussion to ensure IN DT JJ population and scientific community has accurate data on what is happening to our NN . • DT Church can provide open access to its financial information and persuade its affiliates , endowments and churches to do DT same , including detailed disclosure on a place - based basis . • DT Church can encourage JJ governments to publish their budgets and credit information on a place - based basis . Place - based financial disclosure will permit DT alignment of financial ecosystems with environmental ecosystems – a critical step to ensuring a healthy environment . This will create incentive systems which reward DT NN and well - being of all living things . • DT Church can disclose all information on its direct and indirect involvement in any illegal activities , including vote rigging , narcotics trafficking , and money laundering . • DT Church can use its shareholdings and ownership positions in NN companies to insist on integrity in JJ information . • DT Church can use its shareholdings in pharmaceutical and food companies to insist on integrity and independence of scientific research . • DT Church can provide a safe haven for NNS , journalists and other professionals who are targeted for upholding high standards of integrity in NN and information . Slavery contributes significantly to DT degradation of NNS throughout our NN . • DT Church can withdraw from supporting governments , corporations or any other organizations WDT support any form of slavery . • DT Church can destroy DT “ control files ” of prominent businessmen and politicians created through DT use of its networks . • DT Church can complete restoration efforts related to its pedophilia activities and publish complete figures on how much DT Church has spent on all restoration efforts . • DT Church can use its shareholdings and ownership positions in NN and corporate securities to insist on a withdrawal of corporate and NN support for mind control , torture and slavery and DT compromise of individual privacy and sovereignty . DT primary source of environmental damage does not result from market economics – quite DT opposite . PRP results from DT lethal combination of organized crime operating powerful and invisible weaponry coupled with invasive digital systems and sophisticated financial tools on scale . In short , those with DT ability to kill , to destroy and to steal with impunity combine such force with fiat currencies , unsustainable debt , resource extraction , financial fraud , war and genocide in order to centralize wealth and power in a manner which shrinks total wealth . Lawlessness on a JJ scale must be dealt with before PRP destroys our NN . • DT Church can divest its holdings in governments and corporations which engage in these practices . PRP should encourage its affiliates and members to do DT same . • DT Church can RB disassociate from foundations and not - for - profits WDT engage in these practices or WDT launder profits for those who do . • DT Church can make clear IN DT ten commandments apply not just to what PRP do , but to whom and what PRP finance . • DT Church can stop any and all participation by itself and its networks in narcotics trafficking and disgorge DT profits of DT same to DT NNS harmed . No less than DT Economist has rightly pointed out IN PRP are chocking on debt , in part because PRP provide enormous tax subsidies which encourage debt ( see DT Great Distortion ) . Debt throws NNS out of alignment with CD another and with DT environment around them . Ditto fiat currency which is used in a manner to debase JJ populations and economies . PRP must shift to an equity - based financial system which facilitates DT free flow of equity unencumbered by DT intervention and control of organized crime . An equity - based system – which includes DT financing of small businesses , small farms and local economies with equity – will permit PRP to evolve a financial system in which PRP can generate wealth from healing our environment and reducing consumption . • DT Church can encourage these changes by shifting DT significant funds PRP manages as well as those managed by its networks . • DT Church can encourage governments to reduce laws and regulations WDT prevent DT local circulation of equity or WDT prevent DT creation and success of local currency systems . A JJ culture is CD which respects DT sovereignty of every individual . PRP respect human rights . PRP respect property rights . PRP respect privacy . PRP respect DT right of each human being to make up their own mind . • DT Church can withdraw its investments from all governments and corporations ( including NN ) which compromise NNS ’s privacy or which manipulate them via mind control techniques , entrainment technology , subliminal programming or electronics . • DT Church can actively encourage its priests and networks to bring transparency to mind control techniques or any efforts to mislead NNS globally . • DT Church can offer sanctuary to NNS , NN personnel or journalists who bring transparency to these efforts . Before PRP dismiss capitalism , PRP should try PRP . Organized crime is not capitalism . PRP is DT application of force to control and to VB PRP ’s way . Market economics can solve JJ of DT problems before PRP – but PRP have to unleash markets to work rather than prevent them from operating and then blaming DT subsequent “ mess ” on them . • DT Church can call for all monies stolen by illegal means in DT last two decades to be returned , including trillions which have disappeared from DT NNP NN or which have been accrued as a result of financial frauds prior to DT bailouts . • DT Church can refrain from blaming our current situation on DT NNS who have been harmed by these thefts or from insisting IN DT subsequent JJ damage is a result of DT victims ’ poor values or “ consumerism . ” • DT Church can withdraw its investment from financial institutions , governments and corporations WDT : • Provide unlawful or unethical support to cartels and monopolies . • Engage in DT purposeful suppression of technologies which MD ease DT harm PRP are doing to DT environment . DT Church and its affiliates and members manage trillions in real estate and financial assets . As CD of DT most significant capitalist organizations / investment networks on our NN , PRP can institute policies to ensure IN PRP does not invest in companies or governments which behave in DT manner described in DT latest Encyclical and IN its real estate is not used to support such activities . During Vatican II , DT Church forced DT sale of significant real estate holdings which were serving communities . DT proceeds from these sales were reinvested in corporate securities . DT Church can ensure IN DT Orders for whom these funds are managed have access to full transparency about these investments and are permitted to institute policies which ensure IN these investments are managed in accordance with DT goals of this Encyclical . Published JJ military expenditures were $ 1.7 trillion in 2013 . Add secret black budget expenditures and DT total was likely much more . These funds – combined with savings from destructive behavior such as gambling , narcotics and alcohol – MD be shifted into investment in healing our environment , our education systems , our NN care systems and revitalizing JJ infrastructure . • DT Church can bring transparency to all worldwide resources which are related to killing . PRP can invite its members to pray IN these resources be shifted to investments which increase productivity rather than enable a small group of NNS to own and control DT NN . Both DT Church and our NN are dynamic living systems . Moving to a healthy JJ culture and aligning our financial ecosystems with our environmental ecosystems is a journey . • DT Church can encourage its entire network to adopt these goals in their lives so IN achieving them is a partnership of DT JJ for DT benefit of all . • DT Church can publish an annual report on its efforts to take responsibility and to achieve these goals internally in its own operations , asset managements and investments and to invite feedback from all of its constituents to help PRP do so . EX is often a risk IN any important policy will be misunderstood or misused by those who are centralizing control and power . DT G - 7 nations have experienced a financial coup d’etat . A great deal of money and assets have been shifted out of sovereign governments into private hands – either illegally or under DT guise of trillions in bailouts and quantitative easing – while liabilities have been shifted back into governments . Now IN these transfers are complete , PRP MD be convenient to blame DT victims and to abrogate their pensions and other savings plans and promises . PRP MD be unfortunate if this Encyclical were used to justify DT value of doing so in DT name of “ reducing consumerism ” or to politically outmaneuver DT victims by accusing them of being “ selfish . ” Economies function on trust and such trust must come from honoring our agreements . As Pope Francis understands , PRP is easy to blame DT victim and to take from DT powerless . Utah Phillips once VBD , “ DT NNP is not dying , PRP is being killed . And DT NNS doing DT killing have names and addresses . ” PRP commend DT Pope for calling out for a cessation of DT debasement of all living things . Let PRP hope IN his latest Encyclical starts ringing doorbells – beginning with DT opportunity to do so in DT Church and in DT Church ’s asset and investment portfolios ."

"" Structural racism is deeply embedded in all areas of society , and JJ education is no exception , "" according to DT NN in DT August issue of Academic Medicine . To examine DT effect of racism in JJ school , researchers surveyed students at 49 unidentified U.S. JJ schools in their first semester and again in their final semester . "" This NN provides evidence IN racism manifested at multiple levels in JJ schools was associated with graduating students ' decisions to provide care in high - need communities , "" DT article concludes . "" Strategies to identify and eliminate structural racism , and its manifestations in JJ school are needed . "" DT publication is DT latest of more than 30 articles to present findings from DT NNP Student Cognitive Habits and Growth Evaluation NNP ( CHANGES ) , DT first longitudinal survey NN of DT effects of JJ education on students ' biases and attitudes over NN . DT national NN is being conducted by Oregon NNP & NNP University in collaboration with Mayo Clinic 's Research Group on Equity and Inclusion in NNP Care , Yale University and DT University of Minnesota . To limit DT scope , DT NN focused on attitudes toward African Americans , although CHANGES explored attitudes about other groups , as well , explains first author Sean Phelan , Ph.D. , a Mayo Clinic NN sciences researcher . "" I hope DT NN will spark NN , "" Dr. Phelan says . "" I MD VB to see more conversation about diversity and inclusion in curriculum and DT need to make changes in JJ training to minimize racism and bias . "" DT multidisciplinary team hypothesized IN three factors might reflect bias in JJ education , and DT results indicate IN all three predicted whether students changed their minds on wanting to work in an underserved area or in a primarily minority community : • School curricula and policies can create an unintended , structural type of racism if PRP lack or do n't require content on cultural awareness , racial disparities and bias , or provide experience with service learning . "" PRP suggest IN , within JJ education , DT types of courses WDT JJ schools require and DT information WDT PRP prioritize for training JJ physicians can critically shape students ' interest in practicing in underserved areas , "" Dr. Phelan says . • School culture and NN , including behaviors exhibited by faculty and attending physicians , represent a hidden curriculum on acceptable or normal ways to interact . • Individual student attitudes and behaviors tended to VB over four NNS of JJ school . Students ' negative racial attitudes at matriculation were associated with decreased intention to practice with underserved or minority populations at graduation , while students who had more interactions with black students , faculty and allied NN staff , and considered those interactions favorable , were more likely to choose to practice in a black community . DT team found IN racism at DT structural or cultural level MD reinforce a belief in social hierarchy and dissuade students from a career focused on caring for those perceived to be lower in DT hierarchy . However , among students who initially intended to work with minority populations , those who witnessed examples of discrimination in JJ school were more likely to stay committed to DT path . • Service learning experiences and a curriculum focused on improving minority NN were associated with increased intention to practice in underserved communities . • A curriculum focused on minority NN and disparities , students ' perceived skill at developing relationships with minority patients , a higher proportion of minority students at DT school , and awareness of interracial tension in DT JJ school environment were associated with increased intention to care for minority patients . "" PRP 've been following this cohort for a long NN to understand how their experiences in JJ education influence DT predictors of potentially biased care , "" says Michelle van Ryn , Ph.D. , DT principal investigator . Dr. Van Ryn is DT distinguished professor at Oregon NNP & NNP University 's School of Nursing and former director of Mayo Clinic 's Research Program on Equity and Inclusion in NNP Care . "" These findings suggest IN JJ education leaders can take action to affect students ' decisions to work with underserved populations . "" CHANGES began nearly 10 NNS ago . Additional surveys were conducted in DT second and fourth NNS of residency . DT final survey will be administered five NNS after JJ school . To avoid influencing responses , DT team delayed publication of findings until after students graduated from JJ school .

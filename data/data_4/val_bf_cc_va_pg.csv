0,903,"Ignition experiments at NIF are being performed at a variety of target scales. Smaller targets require less energy and can be fielded more frequently. Successful small target designs can be scaled up to take advantage of the full NIF laser energy and power. In this talk, we will consider a rigorous framework for scaling from smaller to larger targets. The framework uses both simulation and experimental results to build a statistical prediction of target performance as scale is increased. Our emphasis is on quantifying uncertainty in scaling predictions with the goal of identifying the dominant contributors to that uncertainty. We take as a particular example the Big Foot platform that produces a round, 0.8 scale implosion with the potential to scale to full NIF size (1.0 scale).

1,921,"Imagine a hulking, growling, 8-foot-tall woodland creature so elusive that professional trackers can’t find it, scientists can only speculate about it and believers can’t prove -- definitively -- that it exists.

Hiding deep in the forest may be your modus operandi, Bigfoot, but Hollywood and Madison Avenue are pushing you -- however reluctantly -- into the spotlight. A slew of documentary, TV and film projects including Animal Planet’s current hit “Finding Bigfoot,” and a Sasquatch film trilogy from “Blair Witch Project” director Eduardo Sanchez are poised to get past the old grainy images of yesterday and give the hairy 800-pound biped a high-def close-up.

“There’s been a real upswing in scholarly interest along with this huge undercurrent of popularity among the general public,” said Jeffrey Meldrum, the Idaho State anatomy and anthropology professor and primates expert who wrote “Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science” as a companion to a Discovery Channel special of the same name. “There’s something about the human psyche that really connects with this icon.”

Campfire stories, eyewitness reports and grainy videos have kept the legend alive for decades in the U.S. and worldwide. (The mythology goes back much further if you take cave drawings into account.) And Bigfoot has been a pop culture fixture since the 1950s, popping up in movies, commercials and as a guest on ‘70s TV hits like “The Six Million Dollar Man” and “The Bionic Woman.”

Each time there’s a new development -- such as evidence of a yeti allegedly uncovered in Russia last fall or a Bigfoot body purportedly discovered in Georgia, both of which turned out to be fake -- there’s a spike in online searches, blog posts, news reports and, inevitably, Bigfoot-centric entertainment.

“Blair Witch’s” Sanchez is working on a Bigfoot-based horror movie, the first of a planned trilogy, and a group of Bigfoot enthusiasts is putting together a documentary called “Sasquatch: The Quest.” Meldrum, along with launching an online scholarly journal, is producing an Internet TV project and considering an expanded version of “Legend Meets Science.”

“We all want to believe that there are still monsters lurking in the secret corners of the planet, and that’s the allure of Bigfoot,” said Marjorie Kaplan, president of Animal Planet, home to the hit series “Finding Bigfoot. “It’s fun to be reminded that we don’t know everything.”

“Finding Bigfoot” follows four eccentric field researchers who travel to towns where there have been sightings, gather stories from the locals and set out on their own expeditions. The colorful characters have coined “squatch” as a term of endearment and say things like “It’s really squatchy out here,” to describe remote areas they think are harboring Bigfoots.

The series, which attracted 1.6 million viewers for its second season premiere, will launch its third season this summer. “If anybody’s going to find him, it’s going to be us,” Kaplan declared, adding with a laugh, “hopefully after 100 episodes.”

In coming months, cable TV will be overrun with Sasquatch programming. Syfy thriller “Bigfoot” promises a “big and nasty, teeth and claws” star nestled in a kitschy popcorn flick, according to Thomas Vitale, the network’s executive vice president of programming. Airing this summer, the Saturday night movie pits former child stars Barry Williams and Danny Bonaduce against each other in a search for the larger-than-life biped at a rural music festival. It fits strategically with the network’s tradition of over-the-top original action movies like “Sharktopus” and “Piranhaconda.”

“Bigfoot is a classic trope of the creature feature,” Vitale said. “It’s a story that spans a lot of cultures ... and it’s ripe for reinvention.”

TV has been doing exactly that by using Bigfoot in purely fictional, and sometimes goofy, ways in series such as Disney Channel’s “Phineas and Ferb” and Nickelodeon’s “iCarly,” not to mention frequent reruns of the ‘80s family comedy film “Harry and the Hendersons.”

In “iBelieve in Bigfoot,” the “iCarly” kids head into the woods looking for the creature in what executive producer Dan Schneider said is one of the series’ most popular episodes to date. The youngsters never actually see Bigfoot, but they hear a menacing growl as they see their RV drive away, leaving them stranded.

“The implication is that Bigfoot’s real, and he’s also a car thief,” Schneider said.

It’s a kid-relevant subject because “every generation discovers the Bigfoot legend, sort of like discovering the Beatles,” said Dan Povenmire, one of the creators of the animated “Phineas and Ferb.” He and partner Jeff “Swampy” Marsh wrote an episode called “Get That Bigfoot Outta My Face,” that sprang from their own childhood memories of hearing scary stories and seeing the famous 1967 Patterson footage of a purported Bigfoot in Northern California.

Even commercials have fun using Bigfoot as a punch line: A current ad for Stride Whitemint gum stars Olympic medalist Shaun White and a yeti who socks a guy in the gut so he’ll spit out his long-lasting chewing gum and replace it with another.

At the more serious end of the spectrum are interview-based docu-style shows such as History’s “Bigfoot: The Definitive Guide,” National Geographic’s “Is It Real?” and Syfy’s “Destination Truth.” Travel Channel’s “Legends of the Ozarks” and “Bigfootville” will poke around in isolated areas for Bigfoot evidence in episodes airing in late March.

Cliff Barackman, an elementary school teacher and cast member on “Finding Bigfoot,” said a TV series dedicated to Sasquatch hunting was “long overdue.”

“When there are multiple shows about cakes and ghosts, why not a show about Bigfoot?” Barackman said. “Our show reinforces the fact that we’re looking for a species, not an individual, and that we’re trying to help people understand what a Bigfoot might actually be.”",mainstream,M0d48c,big.foot
2,534,"Having defeated Arsenal 5-1 in Munich in the first leg of their round-of-16 tie, Bayern have already gone a long way towards securing a spot in the Champions League quarterfinals. As long as they don't concede four unanswered goals, they will be on their way to the next round.

However, Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti is well aware of the fact that it is possible to blow large first-leg leads in the Champions League. In the 2003-04 season, when he was coach of AC Milan, his team took a 4-1 lead over Deportivo La Coruna in the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal - played at home. The Spanish club turned the tie on its head in the second leg in A Coruna, beating Milan 4-0 to advance to the semifinals.

""We are not going on a company outing, this is the Champions League. The door is open, but we must go through it seriously and respectfully,"" Bayern Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told reporters at Munich airport on Monday before the team boarded a charter jet to London.

Jerome Boateng is the only player who will have to miss Bayern's trip to London due to injury as he continues to recover from a shoulder problem. Philipp Lahm will have to sit out too after picking up his third yellow card in the Champions League this season.

Rafinha, who started in Bayern's 3-0 victory over Schalke in their German Cup quarterfinal last week, is expected to step into Lahm's position in defense while Manuel Neuer is to wear the captain's armband.

The Gunners certainly have an uphill road to climb as they seek to turn the tables on Bayern, who have qualified for the Champions League semifinals in each of the last five seasons. Assuming that they fail in their comeback attempt on Tuesday, it will be the seventh straight season in which Arsenal has been eliminated in the round of 16.

Arsene Wenger, who is in his 21st season as Arsenal's manager, has once again come under fire after delivering similar results in recent years. He received a lot of criticism after leaving Alexis Sanchez - who with 17 goals is the team's leading scorer in the Premier League - out of the team in their 3-1 loss to Liverpool on Saturday.

Sanchez, who scored Arsenal's only goal from the penalty spot in the first leg, could be one of the key players for the North London side in their comeback attempt. However, Wenger will not have Mesut Özil at his disposal, after the manager told Monday's press conference that the German internatonal will be forced to sit this one out due to an illness.",mainstream,M0b1c3,big.foot

By SERGE BIELANKO | December 3rd, 2012 at 4:23 pm

 People who don’t believe in Santa Claus are starting to piss me off.

 I mean, what gives, you guys?

 Do you seriously refuse to believe that there is even a remote possibility that a robust, ageless, elfin-man with super magical powers and the ability to travel at the speed of light to deliver happiness to the children of the world exists?

 I don’t get the whole ‘skeptical’ thing here.

 What exactly is so hard to fathom about deer that fly anyway?

 And what?

 You think elves are something someone just happened to make up?

 God, you’re jaded.

 But fine.

 To each his own.

 In my mind though, no matter how bad you have messed up in this life you’ve been living the last 20 or 50 or 70 years or whatever, you haven’t ever screwed things up nearly as bad as you did on that day long ago when you finally sighed into the afternoon wind and whispered to yourself those terribly tragic four words: “There is no Santa.”

 Why do we do that to ourselves?

 Why do we reach an age like 10 or 12 and all of the sudden question maybe the greatest tale we have ever been told? Is it some sort of twisted rite of passage? Are we supposed to feel cooler or, sakes alive, BE cooler once we’ve ‘followed the sheep’ and declared Santa Claus to be extinct?

 It’s a mystery to me.

 Just when we could use a friend like old Saint Nick to help guide us through The Age of Zits and The Prama™ (Prom Drama) Years, we turn around and thank him for his long dedication to our boundless joy by informing him that he is nothing but a bunch of bull.

 Anyhow, I have to try and stem the tide here this year; I’ve got to do my part to try and bring at least a few of you back into the righteous fold of Kringleism (that unfettered belief in magical things).

 See, as one of the few remaining adult believers (and also as former Vice-President of the Unofficial Santa Claus Fan Club, Southeastern Pennsylvania Chapter #828 from 2002-2003), I should think that I’ve been privy to a wee bit more of the truth about who Santa really is than most of you. Plus, as a father to two (count ‘em TWO!) die-hard SantaHeads, I feel like it’s my duty to try and save the last of the lovable legends before it’s all too late.

 So listen up, people of Earth! Read the truth here today and then decided for yourselves!

 You wanted the proof and I’ve got it.

 Santa Claus is real: always was, always will be.



Most of us agree that department stores and the like all hire ‘Elves’ to play the role of Santa in the month leading up to Christmas. But recent revelations in Santa Believer Circles highlight this special photo from the Sears store in Duluth, MN 1964. In it, Mary and Bobby Richards stare into the eyes of what is largely believed to be the REAL Santa Claus in one of his very rare store appearances captured on film! Why do we think this? Because Bobby, now a respected brat salesman in Sheboygan, WI swears it.

Few details are clear about Santa Claus’s youth. However, in 1993, at a yard sale in suburban Reykjavik, Iceland, a woman bought a shoebox full of pictures that contained this stunning find. In it, what appears to be a very young Santa Claus darts through a room with swiftness. Experts all agree that the distinct scoobyish hat he is wearing is found only in distinct pockets of the North Pole , giving further proof that the boy in the picture really is a very young Santa Claus!",conspiracy,C02840,big.foot

Sure, there's a bit of gloom among economic pundits, the politicians are bickering and dickering like good 'uns, and the Middle East is going to hell in a handbasket. But, as Chris Tarrant so irritatingly says, we don't want to give you that.

No, we wordmongers want you to be happy, and we have ways of making you smile. So forget boring old news, and see what fun we've brought you.

The Daily Telegraph has a splendid joke on its front page about an academic at Birmingham University who has carried out a five-year study of the ""cultural meanings"" of snowmen. Dr Tricia Cusack, who must surely be the most sought-after guest at smart parties in the West Midlands this season, wants us to build snow-women instead.

""We need to be alert to which particular images have got currency,"" she explains. ""Why is it always male, and why is it so popular at Christmas? At least the snowman has lost his pipe as society is less geared towards promoting smoking.""

Talking of snowballs - sorry about that but the Telegraph didn't oblige and we have our standards to keep down - the Guardian this morning tells us that Californian scientists have worked out why penguins waddle. It's because they have such short legs and such big feet, that's why. And you thought Californians were dumb?

Not to be outdone, the mirth-merchants of the Times have come up with another animal yarn based on academia. This time scientists in Washington state (could there be something lurking in the water supply on the West coast of America?) have identified a dent in the ground as a possible 'footprint' of the long-sought North American ape known to kids everywhere as Bigfoot. The print is not actually of a foot, but rather of the left forearm, hip, thigh and heel of a large primate. More of a bumprint, really.

Now we've got down to the botty jokes, we mustn't overlook the front page of the Sun, almost entirely devoted this morning to what Guy Ritchie will be wearing under his kilt when he marries Madonna in Scotland tomorrow. Nothing, that's what. And, er, that's it, except to mention that in its noble effort to stretch the story to a couple of hundred words, the Sun includes possibly the oldest joke in Christendom: Q: Is anything worn under the kilt? A: No, everything is in good working order. Ho ho ho.

Back to the animals: the Mirror, after pages of boring real news about brawling popstars and bawling politicians, gets down to the real biz with a picture of a young elephant painting pictures. You really don't need to know why, but you deserve to know that the headline is Botticelephant.

And there's more, much more to come, judging by the latest offerings on the Press Association wire. There's the likely tale, for instance, of the couples converging on Scotland in search of idyllic wedding locations, just like that whatsername.

And the Daily Mail is going to quiver with rage about the latest outbreak of political correctness in the forces: ""The armed forces could be falling foul of health and safety rules because their military bands play too loudly and their rifles are too noisy, it emerged today. The Ministry of Defence has set up a high-level working group to look at the problem after receiving a warning that it could be in breach of regulations on noise levels in the workplace.""

7,591,"Good news, kids! Far more companies are hiring seasonal staff this year than last, with new research from CareerBuilder showing that 41 percent of employers plan to hire summer workers, up from 29 percent in 2016. So, it shouldn’t be too difficult to find a job and help pay down that looming college debt or give back to your folks. But wait — that’s not quite how things work anymore. The summer job, once an obligation, is now merely an option among a few possible routes.

""The summer job is disappearing, and has been over the last 30 years,” said Marc Prosser, co-founder and publisher of FitSmallBusiness.com. An analysis from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that as of July 2016, the teen labor force participation rate was 43.2 percent, down nearly 30 percentage points from its peak of 71.8 percent in July 1978.

There are a number of factors contributing to this decline, but most prominent among them is the increasing popularity of internships.

“Many more students are seeking out internships or research opportunities over the summer now, as opposed to when I first started counseling students [nearly 20 years ago],"" said Dr. Kat Cohen, CEO and founder of IvyWise, an admissions counseling services company. “Everything is more competitive these days, so getting hands-on work experience or hands-on research experience, and making contacts at companies that students might want to work at post-graduation can be a smart move.”

It’s becoming more common for college students to balance unpaid internships with a paying side gig for a company like Uber or Instacart.

“While big cities typically provide more internship opportunities, many on-demand jobs are now available on college campuses as well as big cities,” said Brandon Yahn, founder of Student Loans Guy. “This allows students to take research jobs on campus as internships while still making money.”

“We see a surge in dog walker applications from college students and even school teachers who find themselves with an abundance of time for the summer months,” said Dave Comiskey, co-founder of Barkly Pets. “The job provides time outside, rewarding time spent with adorable pets, and offers more freedom and flexibility than other summer jobs may.”

And the pay is impressive: an average of $18 per half-hour walk.

But more than good pay, it appears young people want good hours. Or, more specifically: the ability to choose them on a whim.

Related: Seven Ways Millennials Are Changing the Workplace for the Better

""Flexibility in shifts and schedules is super attractive to this [younger] workforce,"" said Peter Harrison, CEO of the job search engine website Snagajob. “Whole Foods is losing money to Instacart — which pays less and provides fewer benefits and security — all because the workers prize that flexibility.”

Some employers feel that teenagers are turning their nose up at their recruiting efforts, opting instead for something easier, even if it pays less.

Jared Beckstead, marketing coordinator for Bailey's Moving and Storage, says that his company is desperate for workers during the summer — the business’ busiest time of year — and is keen on hiring teens and college kids. Unfortunately, it’s “almost impossible to find students willing to do the work,” Beckstead told NBC News.

“I would argue that the need for summer help at many businesses is alive and well; the disappearing act has been the work ethic of today’s youth,” Beckstead said, adding that teenage job candidates typically are ""willing to work for less money and fewer hours just because the job is easier.""

Snagajob’s Harrison says he hears this sentiment loud and clear from a variety of companies.

“All of our companies who do seasonal hires, especially in places like Martha's Vineyard, are having a fantastically hard time filling jobs,” Harrison said.

Many teens have the luxury of chasing the dream internship, even if it doesn’t pay — or of hustling with an on-demand gig that gives them freedom. Others may choose to forego work altogether because, as Snagajob’s Harrison points out, “there is a growing acceptance of insane student debt as part of the college process — a restaurant job can only chip away at the edges of it.”

But what about the families who need paychecks coming in from all eligible members? Or the parents of teens living at home who simply want their kid to take whatever job she can get if only to learn the importance of good work ethic?

""​Most parents realize that by coddling their kids and not exposing them to responsibility, both financial and otherwise, they are doing their kids a disservice,"" said Allison Farber Cheston, career expert and job search coach. ""Employers have no patience for young employees who focus most on what the organization can do for them. I spend a lot of time with millennials explaining the importance of humility and hard work.​""

It’s crucial to note that while the summer job isn’t what it used to be, it absolutely still exists and can be just as valuable as an internship down the road.

Related: Five Millennial Jobs that Parents Will Never Understand

""There are a couple of fields where teens can get paid from the start and will acquire good carryover skills for real jobs,” said Cheston. “Those are sales and customer service: Both of those functions will take them out of their comfort zone and teach them how money is made or how to deal with difficult people — excellent skills for real life and work.”

Another classic summer job that can teach valuable skills? Camp counseling. Some programs now combine pay and college credits.

""A college-aged person can work on accounting and payroll at a camp while earning college credits and getting paid,” said Susie Lupert, executive director of the American Camp Association of NY and NJ, adding that it may not be too late to find such a job in your area. “There are always a few last-minute dropouts or staff members who weren’t the right fit, so hires do occur at this time of year for a few positions.”

Not only can more traditional jobs impress hiring managers or admissions counselors in the future, some are affiliated with scholarship programs.

The Chick Evans Scholarship, for instance, has provided full college scholarships to over 11,000 high schoolers who’ve worked as golf caddies in the U.S and Canada.

""Currently, 935 Evans Scholars are enrolled at 20 universities, and more than 10,400 young men and women have graduated as Evans Scholars,” said John Kaczkowski, president and CEO of the Western Golf Association and Evans Scholars Foundation. “This year, 270 students from across the country and Canada were awarded the Evans Scholarship [which comprises] a full, four-year housing and tuition scholarship for teens.”

One of the requirements to qualify the scholarship? “Outstanding character.” And we all know what best builds that. Why, hard work, of course.",mainstream,M0cf59,big.foot

9,941,"Toenail fungus is pretty gross, and so it seems to follow that Jublia's Big J toenail boxing character is a bit unsavory, too.

When the purple-hat wearing big toe debuted during the 2015 Super Bowl, an AOL story claimed that ""Jublia quite literally put its grossest foot forward during its Super Bowl ad, in which a cartoon foot hit the field to tackle its bitter enemy, toenail fungus. It was certainly a far cry from the mix of racy and emotional ads we all expected, and the fungus among us got people talking--and gagging--on Twitter.""

That consumer disdain showed in the ratings, with the ad ranking as the second-worst in the game, according to USA Today's Ad Meter, garnering only a 3.22 rating on its 1-10 scale.

The Valeant ($VRX) drug was approved last June; it was acquired by Valeant through its purchase of Dow Pharmaceutical Sciences in 2008. Big J made its debut in the first ""Fight it, Don't Hide it"" TV spot for the drug last fall. The $4.5 million one-spot Super Bowl ad then kicked off the ongoing 2015 campaign.

In the series of ads, Big J changes hats depending on the occasion, donning boxing headgear for the first fight, a helmet for Super Bowl football, a visor for tennis--which aired around the U.S. Open, featuring commentator ex-pro John McEnroe--and a top hat for post-Emmy TV commercials that also featured actor Mario Lopez.

Valeant declined to answer queries for this article, but EVP Ari Kellen spoke at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference before last year's Super Bowl, saying the drug is off to a great start with 150 reps directly working the brand, along with the DTC campaign. The marketing money will continue to flow ""as long as the growth trajectory continues and the economic returns justify it,"" Kellen said at the conference.

Of course, turning off chip-and-dip eaters during the big game doesn't mean the Big J character hasn't done its job. Sales, as Kellen noted, have been brisk; Valeant quarterly reports show Jublia pulled in $270 million in revenue in the first three quarters of 2015. -- Beth Snyder Bulik

10,43,"If you thought going to Facebook Jail for posting “hate speech” was bad – and it is – here’s a tip: do not move to China. The government there has been controlling what users can see and do online for years. For those who value human rights, the situation is getting worse at an accelerating pace.

With the help from certain high-tech giants, the country promises to lead the world in becoming the first actual Orwellian surveillance state.

In May 2010, the Communist Chinese government issued its first white paper regarding what it called “a crystallization of human wisdom” – the internet.

The white paper acknowledges the usefulness and importance of advancing this digital science and technology. It “energetically advocates and actively supports the development and application of the Internet across the country.”

The white paper guarantees that citizens will enjoy a free press and freedom of speech on the internet:

“The Chinese government encourages and supports the development of Internet news communication undertakings, provides the public with a full range of news, and at the same time guarantees the citizens’ freedom of speech on the Internet as well as the public’s right to know, to participate, to be heard and to oversee in accordance with the law.”

This is where the white paper reveals the “gotcha” clause: the Chinese policy uses “the law” to control online communications. Now we know that this law is targeting the very things the white paper promised would be given: unhindered access to World Wide Web news and social media internet sites for both residents and foreign users:

“The Chinese government will stick to the basic principle of administering the Internet in accordance with the law, try to follow the nature and law of development of the Internet in the light of the national conditions, and promote the scientific development of the Internet with effective administration so as to contribute to the development of the Internet worldwide.”

In 2011, China began requiring internet companies to sign a “Public Pledge of Self-Regulation and Professional Ethics for China Internet Industry” which purported to regulate the “patriotic observance of law, equitableness, trustworthiness and honesty.”

Signers accused of violating the state-mandated pledge to uphold the nation’s laws would be subject to review by the Internet Society of China. If found guilty, such a company could have it “membership” (read: authorization to do business) revoked.

Since Xi Jinping became China’s Communist Party leader in November of 2012, media censorship has flourished. In February 2016, the Chinese president toured the top three state-run media outlets. His message: you must swear absolute loyalty to the Party and follow the Party line in “thought, politics, and action.”

Xi was completely candid about what the online service companies were in business to do – serve the state by dishing out distorted information:

“The media run by the party and the government are the propaganda fronts and must have the party as their family name.”

Xi told tech workers that “All the work by the party’s media must reflect the party’s will, safeguard the party’s authority, and safeguard the party’s unity.”

Freedom House published in its findings on “Freedom on the Net 2016” that internet freedom “around the world declined in 2016 for the sixth consecutive year” with China leading the way for the second year in a row. President Xi’s “information security” policy was proving effective in providing both surveillance and censorship.

Another effect observed was an increase in self-policing while surfing the net:

“Dozens of prosecutions related to online expression have increased self-censorship, as have legal restrictions introduced in 2015.”

Since 2011, the Chinese state-operated telecom company Tencent has been subsidizing and regulating the nation’s largest social media site, called WeChat. With over a thousand million users – that’s one billion as reckoned in American English – WeChat is a primary source for news and views, just like its American social media counterparts Twitter and Facebook.

Critics of WeChat say it promotes “the spread of sensationalist falsehoods.”

In June 2018, a new WeChat in-app feature lets users validate news items by consulting – guess who? – WeChat employees (or volunteers) who perform the fact-checking.

One very clever ploy over at WeChat is a “Top Ten Rumors” category. The government systematically debunks leading consumer education topics such as health and safety, product recalls, and scams as fake news. Here are two examples of state-driven information control:
• An article told people to stop using microwave ovens because microwaved food gives people cancer (false).
• Chinese currency can be scanned in the app QQ to see if they are counterfeit (also false).

WeChat even has a Google-like “WeChat rumor debunking assistant” which 300,000 people consult daily.

This is all well and good but observers point out that Chinese online censors have the power to delete any and all unsavory, anti-state, and illegal articles before anyone else can view them. This form of censorship pre-empts any fact-checking since there are no facts to check.

Weibo is an online service that has been called the Chinese Twitter. The micro-blogging platform enables the government to anticipate and counteract planned protests through monitoring all communications (just like the NSA in the United States).

Between Weibo snooping and WeChat censorship, a new generation of Chinese citizens is growing up ignorant of significant historical events that have been scrubbed from the official narrative. Any private or group chat conversation that mentions Tiananmen Square, Tibet or the Falun Gong (a forbidden religious group) is banned. The user is not notified that their message was never sent.

An uneasy feeling is growing as we in the west have watched China roll out its social credit score system, spy eyeglasses, and flocks – that is, fleets – of flying surveillance doves.

China is racing ahead in the technology game, all for the sake of Communism and totalitarian statism. There is evidence they hacked Hillary Clinton’s emails. And they added a spy chip to thousands of computers that were purchased by top U.S. companies.

Now, U.S. tech giant Google is going ahead with its contract to develop a customized, censored version of the search engine to help China perfect its internet chokehold. Google employees with a conscience and a clue are quitting rather than support the Communist regime.

Things are bad in China and we predict they will only get worse. Even more disturbing is the thought that other countries are also quietly following China’s lead.

Will China create the blueprint for New World Order domination through state-directed propaganda, censorship, and surveillance? And what, if anything, can the rest of us do about it?",conspiracy,C00a83,big.foot; cancer; new.world.order
11,885,"Polish Government Confirms Discovery Of Nazi “Gold Train”, Warns It May Be Booby-Trapped

Last weekend we reported that in the past month two men, a Pole and German, claimed to have discovered the legendary Nazi “gold train” – a 150 meter long German train alleged to be full of gold, gems and weapons, which disappeared just before the end of World War II – in the proximity of the Polish town of Walbrzych, close to where the Nazi are said to have loaded up the train with valuables for its final voyage in the town of Wroclaw, just as the Soviet forces approached in 1945.

As we detailed, the train is said to have been entombed in the vast tunnel labyrinth located close to Ksiaz castle, which served as Nazi headquarters during World War II…

… and specifically, was said to be located at the foot of the Sowa mountain, in the woods three miles outside the town of Walbrych.

The “gold train” is said to be located under this hill

While many were skeptical that the mystical Nazi treasure train had been finally discovered after many years of searching, an official update last Friday by the Polish government suggested that that may indeed be the case. As the Mail reported on Friday, a representative of the Polish culture ministry, Poland’s National Heritage and Conservation Officer Piotr Zuchowski, said that the man who helped hide the train had revealed its location shortly before he died, and that proof of the train has been observed on radar.

Zuchowski added that “Information about where this train is and what its contents are were revealed on the deathbed of a person who had knowledge of the secret of this train.’ He added that Polish authorities had now seen evidence of the train’s existence in a picture taken using a ground-penetrating radar. He said the image – albeit blurred – showed the shape of a train platform and cannons.

Mr Zuchowski said the find was ‘unprecedented’, adding: ‘We do not know what is inside the train. ‘Probably military equipment but also possibly jewellery, works of art and archive documents.

‘Armored trains from this period were used to carry extremely valuable items and this is an armored train, it is a big clue.’ He said authorities were now ’99 percent sure the train exists’ and whatever is on it will be returned to the rightful owners, if they can be found. ‘We will be 100 per cent sure only when we find the train,’ Mr Zuchowski added.

The train found in the mountains is an ‘armored train’ which looks similar to the one pictured

Mr Zuchowski told reporters that the train was about 100 metres long but added: ‘It is not possible to disclose the exact location of where the train can be found. Still, he noted cryptically that “The local government in Walbrzych knows where it is.”

He explained it is hidden along a 4km stretch of track on the Wroclaw-Walbrzych line.

Mr Zuchowski said the person who claimed he helped load the gold train in 1945 said in a ‘deathbed statement’ the train is secured with explosives. The official declined to comment further about the man who said this but speculation is now rife that it was a former SS guard or a local Pole who stumbled upon the train before hiding it.

Deputy Mayor of Walbrzych, Zygmunt Nowaczyk told the press: ‘The city is full of mysterious stories because of its history. ‘Now it is formal information – we have found something.’

Key excerpts from the press conference by the Polish official can be seen on the Euronews clip below:

The confirmation of the discovery unleashed a surge of treasury hunters, and forced the Polish government to warn the population to stop looking because it could be booby-trapped and dangerous. Zuchowski said “foragers” have become active since two people claimed to have discovered the train last week and urged eager fortune-hunters to stop searching, saying they risk injury or death.

Zuchowski adds that “there may be hazardous substances dating from the Second World War in the hidden train, which I’m convinced exists. I am appealing to people to stop any such searches until the end of official procedures leading to the securing of the find. There’s a huge probability that the train is booby-trapped.’

If anything, tthese warnings are sure to unleash an even more aggressive wave of seekers now that the train’s existience has been confirmed, and the government is actually warning seekers to be careful in their search.

But perhaps what is more interesting is just what the discovery, which would be straight out of an Indiana Jones sequel, will contain, and whether someone already got to the precious cargo over the past 7 decades. The answer should be made public shortly.

12,1248,"Anyone seeking ultimate proof of the existence of Bigfoot should head south. In Texas, it is legal to shoot and kill this legendary giant ape, known in other parts of the world as Sasquatch or Yeti, which has never been discovered.

According to an official with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission, Bigfoot isn't listed as an endangered species, so you're free to kill as many as you want.

""If the Commission does not specifically list an indigenous, nongame species, then the species is considered nonprotected nongame wildlife,"" David Sinclair, direction of the law enforcement division at Texas Parks and Wildlife, wrote in an email response to a curious Bigfoot believer. ""A nonprotected nongame animal may be hunted on private property with landowner consent by any means, at any time and there is no bag limit or possession limit.""

John Lloyd Sharf of Salem, Ore., contacted Texas Parks and Wildlife to inquire whether Bigfoot was protected in Texas. As one of the 29 percent of Americans who believe Bigfoot inhabits the country's remote woodland areas and is just really difficult to find, Sharf was apparently motivated by the concern that the as-yet-undiscovered creature could face extermination in the state.

""So, it is the case all individuals of an unknown species … could be exterminated without criminal or civil repercussions — essentially causing extinction ?"" Sharf said he replied to Sinclair. At Cryptomundo, a popular ""cryptozoology"" discussion forum and blog, Bigfoot believers are forming a plan of action to deal with what they see as the potentially disastrous outcome of this loophole in the Texas hunting laws, which would allow Bigfoot to be hunted to extinction before a living specimen could be studied. [ Hunter Captures UFO in Nevada ]

""I would advocate a small group of trained hunters, under close supervision and observing all necessary safety precautions shooting a SINGLE individual to provide a type specimen,"" wrote a user who goes by the name AreWeThereYeti. ""Then, once the existence of Sasquatch was proven, immediate steps could be taken to attach an endangered/protected status to both the species and its habitat.""

13,712,"Brian McBride was the sort of kid who lived life in perpetual motion. So the moment he put foot to soccer ball at age 8, he knew he’d met his match in sports. He slept with his soccer ball; he dribbled up and down the stairs in his home in Arlington Heights, Ill., driving his mother nuts. “I played soccer like a madman,” he says.

Although he may have his indoor-dribbling problem under control, McBride, 29, still has that same passion. A striker for professional soccer’s Columbus Crew, he’s often called the Michael Jordan of the U.S. game for his gravity-defying airborne maneuvers. His talents go on worldwide display June 5, when the U.S. team takes on Portugal in its first game of the World Cup, the monthlong international soccer orgy, in South Korea and Japan.

This is not the first time around on the world pitch for the 6’1″ McBride. He scored America’s only goal in the ’98 competition in France. “It was just an awesome feeling,” says McBride. (As in France, the U.S. is expected to be KO’d early in Korea.) And McBride remains a bright spot. “We don’t have another player with his capabilities,” says ESPN lead soccer analyst Ty Keough. “He’s taken what God gave him and made the most out of it.”

Yet he’s had to overcome his share of challenges. In September of 2000, while McBride was spending the off-season with an English soccer franchise, he noticed a sudden, dramatic swelling in his armpit after a game. It turned out to be thoracic outlet syndrome, a rare disorder in which compression of the blood vessels causes dangerous blood clots. Though the condition was not life-threatening, it put his career in jeopardy. Doctors performed surgery to dissipate the clot, and after two months he was back on the field. In August 2001 he developed another painful clot in his right arm. This time surgeons removed a rib to relieve pressure on McBride’s veins. “I have never seen anyone quite so sick,” Maddie McBride Bisulca, 56, recalls of her son, who has since recovered so completely that doctors say the disorder will not recur. “He was so courageous and strong.”

But he was not quite ready to quit the sport he adored. His brother Matt remembers visiting him in a Denver hospital and trying to cheer him up. “If you never play another day,” Matt told him, “everything will still be fine.” The attempt at comfort was met with heart-wrenching silence. “You could see it come over his face,” says Matt. “He was just very sad.”

McBride is the rambunctious second of three children Maddie had with husband Matthew, an advertising sales representative (whom she divorced when Brian was 4). “If I didn’t keep the doors padlocked, then he always would find a way to run outside,” says Maddie, who raised the kids on her own, often holding down three jobs. “He just never liked to be still.”

He was also a natural on the field. After stellar high school and college careers—he was a two-time All-American at Saint Louis University—he landed a professional gig in Wolfsburg, Germany, where he was disappointed to find that many of his fellow players treated the sport he loved as a mere occupation. “You weren’t supposed to be happy,” he says. “You were supposed to be doing your job.”

He was thrilled to return to the U.S., where in 1996 the Crew picked him as the first player in the fledgling Major League Soccer’s inaugural draft. Turns out his bout with illness was also an opportunity of sorts. Recuperating from his first surgery back in Arlington Heights, he ran into Dina Barnett, a childhood acquaintance who was going through a divorce. “He was the most caring and loving person I’d ever met,” she recalls of their first meeting. Last February they married, making McBride stepfather to Dina’s daughter Ashley, nearly 2.

Fully recovered, McBride relishes being a dad, but with the heavy travel schedule of his pro team as well as the U.S. national team, he gets only limited time with the family. Still, he is getting back a little bit of what he dished out as a kid. “Ashley’s so active—she’s always running around,” he says. “But if she wants to learn soccer, I’ll help.”",mainstream,M132b8,big.foot
14,123,"In the 12th century, foot binding had become much more widespread, and by the early Qing Dynasty (in the mid-17th century), every girl who wished to marry had her feet bound. The only people who didn't bind their feet were the very poor, ethnic Hakka people, and women who worked in fishing because they had needed to have normal feet in order to balance themselves on boats.

At what age did girls get their feet bound? What did the practice entail?



 Girls would have their feet bound between the ages of four and six; any younger, the girls couldn't endure the pain, and by the time they were older than six their feet had already grown too large. Four to six was the ideal age because you could reason with the girls and help them deal with the pain. Foot binding would occur in a ritualistic ceremony accompanied by other traditions intending to ward of bad luck.

The procedure entailed bending the girls' toes underneath the sole, using very long ribbons to wrap their feet all the way to the ankle. Basically, the idea was to keep breaking the foot whenever it grew too large, a process that usually took between two and three years. Then the feet would be bound for the rest of the girl's life.

The girls, naturally, developed a peculiar way of walking—almost as if they had hooves. And in order to facilitate moving around, women with bound feet developed strong muscles in their hips, thighs, and buttocks, so much so that these characteristics were considered physically attractive to the Chinese men of the era.

When did foot binding go out of favor?

In the 19th century, toward the end of the Qing Dynasty, Western countries effectively colonized China and many Western people began to move to the country. This coincided with the height of foot binding, when the practice was most prevalent. So many Western women, especially the wives of Christian missionaries, became strong advocates against the practice, producing pamphlets and even opening shelters in support of afflicted women. Around the same time, Chinese intellectuals who had studied abroad in Europe and in North America returned to China and stated their support for abolishment. So by the time Pearl Buck was writing in 1923, after the Qing Dynasty had fallen, the practice had become unfashionable.

This change in fashion suddenly had a perverse side effect: a lot of girls who had had their feet bound in order to become marriageable suddenly found themselves abandoned by their husbands because foot binding was no longer fashionable. Worse, in bigger cities some people would catch women with bound feet and cut off their bindings, a humiliation because these women would never, ever show their bare feet to anyone—not even their husbands. For them, the process that began with a lot of pain and tears likewise ended with pain and tears.",mainstream,M13335,big.foot
15,462,"Police in South Carolina are warning cryptozoology enthusiasts who think they've spotted Bigfoot, not to take potshots at the creature.

The Greenville Police Department, in Greenville, South Carolina, posted the tongue-in-cheek warning on its Facebook page on Tuesday morning.

It came the day after a report surfaced about an alleged Bigfoot close encounter in neighboring North Carolina.

The police Facebook post was equal parts poking fun and straight up 'don't shoot!' safety advice for its community.

In the post, police exhorted: 'If you see Bigfoot, please do not shoot at him/her, as you'll most likely be wounding a fun-loving and well-intentioned person, sweating in a gorilla costume.'

The post also stated, tongue-firmly-in-cheek that after having reviewed shaky video of an apparent Bigfoot sighting from 2015, 'we can say with some confidence that proof of Bigfoot still eludes us.'

The police linked to the video, which showed a Yorkie trying to scare off a two-footed, rapidly moving entity in daylight.

The Greenville police's Bigfoot warning went up the day after the Charlotte Observer revealed that a member of a Bigfoot-watching group claimed to have had an encounter with a 'large bipedal animal covered in hair,' on Friday night at about 11pm, in a wooded area in North Carolina's McDowell County.

John Bruner, of Bigfoot 911, reported that at the time of the apparent sighting, he and six others were in the woods, spreading out glow sticks in hopes of attracting Bigfoot's attention.

According to the Charlotte Observer, Bruner wrote in a Facebook post that, 'I turned on my headlamp and saw a large bi-pedal animal covered in hair.' He described the creature as having had a smooth, solid black face and shaggy hair.

Bruner noted that he chased the creature and had a 'stare-down' with it, before it disappeared deeper into the woods.

Bigfoot sighting reports in the Carolinas are common, with multiple reports circulating around Bigfoot enthusiasts Facebook groups and drawing enough attention from professional Bigfoot hunters to warrant filming episodes of TV series in the area.

Laws regarding the shooting of Bigfoot and other similar cryptids vary by state.

Mental Floss reported, for example, that killing Bigfoot is expressly outlawed in Skamania County, Washington, but it's technically legal to hunt and kill one in Texas because the cryptid is not on the state's recognized official species list.",mainstream,M0d7cd,big.foot

17,737,"Bigfoot and Mineworm sound like cartoon characters. They are, in fact, the names of two mechanical giants designed to make people safer from the estimated 60 million land mines scattered around the world. Working in tandem, the pair destroy mines in ways that are faster and safer � and more ecofriendly and cost-effective � than any system to date.""By the end of this year,"" says inventor Bob French, ""we will have the first two machines in Bosnia-Herzegovina."" There, with the continued assistance of the British government's Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (dera), Bigfoot and Mineworm will help to destroy some of the estimated 1 million mines left over from the 1992-95 war. Mines continue to kill up to 10 people there each month.The idea for Bigfoot and Mineworm began in early 1997, when Leicestershire-based French watched a television report of the Princess of Wales' trip to central Angola. As Diana inspected a minefield, wearing a flak jacket and face shield, French's eye was drawn to those working nearby. ""People were poking sticks in the ground,"" he recalls, using the same mine-clearance methods he saw during his Royal Air Force service decades earlier, in Borneo and Sarawak.""Mines are unsophisticated weapons and they need an unsophisticated method of dealing with them,"" says French, who has a broad industrial background in electronics. After research and consultation with mine clearers, he concluded that two remote-controlled and camera-equipped machines were needed. The first, Bigfoot, has piston-driven armored feet that stamp every square centimeter of ground that the machine passes over, detonating any mines. Bigfoot has no need of minefield maps, and its system of shock absorption, blast deflection and energy dissipation prevents damage from antipersonnel devices. If larger, antitank mines damage one of the feet, a replacement can be installed in the field.Trailing in Bigfoot's wake, Mineworm excavates up to 55 cm of soil. It removes and crushes all unexploded ordnance, including faulty mines, sorts out ferrous metal for further inspection and � unlike its heavier military predecessors � returns noncompacted soil to the ground, allowing crop planting and growth. Having passed initial tests in the U.K., the 5-ton prototypes of French's Land Mine Disposal System (LMDS) are being fined-tuned to make them smaller so they can be more easily transported and maneuvered on country roads and bridges. After a three-month field trial in Bosnia � in which teams of mine clearers using dogs will follow the machines to verify that nothing is missed � they are expected to remain at work there. ""It's pretty certain that the prototype does what Bob says it will,"" says Colin Lowe, project manager for dera's Countermine Warfare Research Team, which oversaw two weeks of trials on sandy hills, clay soil and mud in England. ""No one machine is going to clear the world of mines,"" says Lowe, but French's system takes a ""golf-bag approach,"" using different tools for different tasks on different terrains. Pat Banks, an independent land mines consultant working in Bosnia � where fewer than 60 sq km were cleared last year � considers the machines ""absolutely essential."" Depending on terrain, they can clear up to 500 sq m in an hour; a human team could cover perhaps 200 sq m in a day.Initial development funds for French's prototypes came from a business friend, Rupert King. Today, the LMDS is supported by Redbus Investments, set up in 1998 by entrepreneur Cliff Stanford. ""This British solution to a global tragedy is testament to the wealth of innovation that exists in this country,"" Stanford says. ""We now need governments and aid agencies to come on board and get Bigfoot and Mineworm in the field."" Given the speed at which the LMDS can clear mines, French argues, international donors such as the European Union, the U.S. and Canada ""would get more for their aid dollars."" The cost of the two machines � plus attachments, spare parts, training and field support � would be about $750,000 in the first year, he says, but then would drop to about $300,000.While Bigfoot and Mineworm are being prepared for Bosnia, French is making his own plans. He wants to play football with local children in a field that his machines have made safe. Even farther down that unmined road, he says, he'd like to go out of business � in a world that no longer has any land mines.",mainstream,M0d42c,big.foot
18,532,"It was hailed as ""definitive evidence"" that Bigfoot existed. The discovery of ""something large, hairy and frozen in ice"" in woods in America by a heroic police officer made international headlines and attracted interest from a team who have been earnestly searching for the legendary ape-like beast for years.

They purchased the remains for an undisclosed fee and set about the delicate process of thawing the body. So it is hard to imagine just how disappointing it must have been to discover, not Sasquatch, but a rubber gorilla suit.

Steve Kulls, of Squatchdetective.com and host of Squatchdetective Radio, revealed the bad news: Matt Whitton, a police officer on leave after being shot while on duty, and Rick Dyer, a former Georgia corrections officer, had achieved fame on a global scale with a hoax of breathtaking transparency.

As they held a much publicised press conference in California on 15 August about their alleged discovery in the wooded hills of Georgia, near a remote region where sightings of the creature are often reported, Whitton had insisted: ""Everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words.""

The pair, who were offering weekend Bigfoot tracking expeditions for about £250, described the creature as a 7ft 7in, male, weighing over 560lb (255kg), with huge human-like feet and reddish hair.

Hundreds of thousands watched videos of the remains posted on YouTube. People started to believe.

Mr Kulls said: ""A police officer of seven years, on medical leave, labelled as a hero for being wounded in the line of duty, got up in front of the world and told the world of how he and Mr Dyer uncovered this creature,"" he said.

""On August 16, the freezer containing the alleged corpse arrived with the Searching For Bigfoot Team.

""The ice was being thawed slowly without aid, to prevent any decomposition of the alleged corpse. We estimated that the freezer and its contents weighed over 1,500lbs and it would take several days or longer to thaw completely.

""The following day we were up early to discover that some hair was now exposed. I extracted some from the alleged corpse, examined it and had some concerns.""

The team decided to burn a sample which they said ""melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair"".

""We began an expedited melting process. Within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head... I was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm, but unusually hollow in one small section. This was yet another ominous sign,"" Mr Kulls said.

""Within the next hour of thaw, a break appeared up near the feet area. As the team and I began examining this area near the feet, I observed the foot which looked unnatural, reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot.

""Later that day, we were informed that Mr Whitton and Mr Dyer had admitted it was a costume.""

Phone calls to Whitton and Dyer went unreturned yesterday, but a voicemail recording for their Bigfoot Tip Line, which also proclaims they are searching for leprechauns and the Loch Ness monster, has been updated with the information about a new search for ""big cats and dinosaurs"".

""If you see any of those, give us a call,"" it says.",mainstream,M0d1dc,big.foot
19,723,"Marion, North Carolina (CNN) A huge crowd of people had gathered on the lawn of the McDowell County Courthouse Saturday when an ape-like creature in a T-shirt bounded through the cheering onlookers and joined Marion Mayor Steve Little on stage.

""This morning I have this special proclamation,"" Little said, holding up a document with his signature and a gold seal at the bottom. He read aloud.

""I do hereby proclaim today, Saturday, September 8, 2018, that Bigfoot is the official animal of the city of Marion, North Carolina,"" Little said, as the costumed Bigfoot clapped enthusiastically.

Thus began the inaugural Western North Carolina Bigfoot Festival in this town near the Blue Ridge Mountains about 40 miles east of Asheville.

Mayor Steve Little presented Bigfoot with a declaration naming him Marion's official animal for the day.

Converging on Marion were thousands of believers and skeptics alike, united in their celebration of a cryptozoological mystery that has fascinated people for decades.

""Bigfoot is real,"" said festival organizer John Bruner, ""and we want to bring awareness to that and bring more people to the table to get this mystery solved.""

Bruner is part of something called the Bigfoot 911 research team, which investigates purported Bigfoot sightings and evidence. He has lived in Marion all his life and said he decided to stage the festival after the town's business association approached him with the idea.

""And, at the same time,"" he added, ""we want to have fun and fellowship with our fellow citizens and our visitors.""

If you ignored the Bigfoot T-shirts, the Bigfoot artwork and the occasional costumed Bigfoot, the festival seemed like any a small Southern city might hold at the tail end of summer.

The day started with a 5K before three blocks of downtown Marion's Main Street were closed to vehicles for the day. Vendors from North Carolina and beyond sold everything from knit hats to jewelry. There was barbecue, Chick-fil-A, funnel cakes, shaved ice and plenty of beer for parents who sought refuge in the shade as their kids frolicked in bouncy houses.

The legendary Bigfoot -- or Sasquatch, if you prefer -- is most commonly associated with the Pacific Northwest. But sightings have been reported all over North America -- including in Marion, said Little, who has lived in the town for decades.

Folks around this town of 7,500 report one or two sightings a year, he said.

""For years there were people who would talk about, 'Oh, I saw a great big old footprint out in the woods — it's bigger than a coyote, and it wasn't a bear.'""

'Do you believe it?'

Bruner's fellow Bigfoot researchers set up a tent with evidence they'd spent years gathering. All day people waited in line to examine photographs, video footage, audio recordings and casts of purported Bigfoot feet and hands.

Researcher Lee Woods, who has spent a decade chasing Bigfoot, displayed two casts. The first was a massive foot, 14 inches long and 7 inches wide. The other was less identifiable. It looked sort of like a clump of plaster and pine straw, with what appeared to be an extra toe.

""It's either 6 toes, which is a deformity, or it's a hand, and that's the knuckles,"" said Woods, pointing.

""He's knuckle-dragging,"" he explained. ""They walk upright, but they will drop on all fours and knuckle-drag like a gorilla, and then stand up and take off.""

At a nearby table, researcher Tim Dills displayed a series of photos he captured on trail cameras set up in the woods. One appeared to be a picture of brush, but Dills pointed to what he said was a face in the foliage.

Two men studied the photos before walking away.

""Well, do you believe it?"" one asked.

""Not yet,"" his companion replied.

Sitting on a curb nearby was Colby Wollack, who said he definitely considers himself a believer. ""There's too much land out there, and there's so much evidence,"" he said.

His wife, Monica Fortenberry, couldn't help but crack a smile. She was skeptical.

""There's just no way that there is something of this size out in the woods anywhere,"" she said. ""It's either a bear, or it's not.""

Between them was Monica's brother, Montgomery. He doesn't quite believe in Bigfoot — the evidence didn't convince him — but said he considers himself an ""enthusiast.""

""I think it's a great hobby and I think people should keep doing it whether they believe in it or not,"" he said. ""I like the idea of it, even if it's never proven. I think it's still a good story.""

In the afternoon, throngs of festivalgoers regrouped on the courthouse lawn for what organizers dubbed a ""town hall.""

But instead of discussing municipal issues, one Bigfoot believer after another stood up to share stories of their encounters.

One person mentioned seeing an aging Bigfoot whose fur was graying. Another shared an account of seeing a female Bigfoot and her baby dash into the woods at around 30 mph. Multiple people mentioned ""yellow eyes"" and a foul odor akin to the scent of a dead animal.

Still others described hearing a roar.

""It wasn't a growl and it wasn't a scream,"" one person said. ""More like a guttural, gibberish thing.""

""You're looking at something that don't exist,"" said a man from Virginia.

A few folks who shared their stories said it took years for them to screw up the courage to tell anyone about their Bigfoot sightings for fear of appearing ""crazy.""

""But I know what I heard,"" a woman told the crowd. ""I know what I smelled, and I know how it made me feel.""

The lawn was a judgment-free zone. Many people in the crowd wore T-shirts professing their faith in Sasquatch's existence.

""Gone Squatchin,"" some shirts said (Yes, that's a verb, as in: to ""squatch,"" the act of looking for Bigfoot). Some declared Bigfoot the Hide and Seek World Champion, while others flipped the tables, saying, ""Bigfoot saw me but nobody believes him.""

Still others bore a simple directive: ""Believe.""

But when one man stood up to share his story and asked how many believers were in the crowd, only about half raised their hands.

Many of the researchers said they are used to doubters, and it doesn't necessarily bother them.

""I totally respect their opinions,"" Bruner said. ""I respect the fact that they don't believe, and I just want them to respect the fact that I do.""

Other researchers said they encourage skeptics to go out into the woods and search for evidence themselves, because they'll never find it on a computer.

One Bigfoot researcher, Daniel Hurst, said he appreciates skeptics because they force him to be diligent in his work.

""They're a very positive thing for us, actually,"" he said, raising his voice to combat the sound of a generator fired up nearby. ""For those of us who are in the business for legitimacy, (skeptics) keep us honest.""

One group of non-believers said they were just at the festival to have a good time and to enjoy the company of people who were passionate about something. That was something they could appreciate, they said.

As recordings of purported Bigfoot calls bellowed from the evidence tent, Micah Loving explained he's a fan of the mystery of Bigfoot and understands why the researchers are excited. But mainly, he said, squatchin' is something fun to do with your friends.

""You drink beers and you have fun and you might hear something and you might scream out into the woods and get a reaction maybe from some other creature — most likely not a Bigfoot — but it's tons of fun and it's just the whole hunt,"" he said.

Loving and his friends had just been to the evidence tents and said they weren't persuaded by anything they saw.

They chuckled as a member of their group, Andrea York, addressed a Bigfoot call that was reverberating in the background.

""You can say no other animal makes that sound,"" York said, echoing an assertion from one of the researchers. ""But I'm pretty sure I had a He-Man action figure that made that sound.""

There may be a broad divide between Bigfoot skeptics and believers. But on this day you couldn't tell.

Festivalgoers were all smiles at the Bigfoot calling contest, where laughter and applause greeted the brave people who yawped into a microphone, doing their best to mimic a Bigfoot cry. One contestant actually got down on one knee and proposed to his girlfriend as the crowd broke out in raucous cheers.

People danced on the lawn and in the street as a DJ blasted Bruno Mars' ""Treasure"" and Kid Rock's ""All Summer Long."" They took pictures of each other grinning in front of a ""Bigfoot Crossing"" sign at the intersection of South Main and West Court Street.

Despite the heat, a teenage boy dressed in a Sasquatch costume posed for pictures with a little girl. When she burst into tears he took off his mask to comfort her, smiling through the sweat.

""In a world where there's so much bad stuff that's happening, we need some good stuff, too,"" Bruner told CNN.

The entire day felt like an echo of something Mayor Little told festivalgoers that morning at the opening ceremony: It doesn't matter what your gender is, or what your race is, or what your politics are.

""To Bigfoot,"" he said, ""you all taste the same.""",mainstream,M08608,big.foot
20,63,"Since its release in early 2014, the big-budget movie “Noah” has caused controversy for not being biblically accurate. While that is certainly the case, the movie does more than take liberties with the Bible: “Noah” pushes messages that have nothing to do with the Bible. These messages are actually political and come directly from the world elite. The primary message? Humanity needs to be cleansed … again.

Throughout his movie-making career, Darren Aronofsky has created quite a few controversial movies with a powerful underlying message (see my article on the movie Black Swan here). None of his work can be considered “idiotic” and, despite what critics say, Noah is not an idiotic movie either. Sure, it contains giant stone monsters, primitive bazookas and Noah killing a bunch of poor souls, but the movie is smart enough to effectively communicate several of its core messages, twisting one of the oldest tales in the world to push an agenda that is very 2014.

While many viewers were upset about the many liberties taken in this retelling of Noah’s Ark – a tale that exists in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim literature – the messages added to the story should be even more upsetting. Noah re-formats this ancient tale to describe the basic premise of a new religion, one that has been pushed on the masses for years. Based on the elite’s long-term Agenda of drastically depopulating the Earth, this new religion is about radical environmentalism, the devaluation (and even hatred) of human life, and the re-alignment of morality towards a new axis.

Through its odd narrative, the movie turns the tale of Noah’s Ark into an absurd and disturbing adventure that leads viewers wondering: Why is God so evil? And why is Noah such a jerk? When Noah’s wife asks him if “the Creator” (that’s the name for God in the movie) will help them survive, Noah’s answer is almost comedic, as if he was describing a super-villain:



While the Bible explains that the Great Flood was caused by a mysterious race of Giants corrupting and “infecting” humanity, the movie does not go that route. Instead, it repeatedly tells us that humans are evil and deserve to die.

Before getting into the actual story, I need to point out a detail that is seemingly trivial, but that tells loads about the movie’s true goal: Why is everybody dressed as if they got their clothes from the world’s first Zara store?

These made-for-a-2014-audience outfits basically tell us that Noah is not about the Bible – it is about today. It is a message to humanity right now, directly from the elite.

While the premise of Noah is based on the Biblical story from the book of Genesis, the creators invented characters, subplots, symbols, images, and messages to completely reshape the tale, giving it a twisted, disturbing and wholly “unspiritual” meaning. Even if one watches the movie fully expecting a “creative retelling” of Noah’s Ark, it is difficult to not be disturbed by the bloody, violent, near-psychopathic tangent taken by the main character. I mean, Noah actually kills a bunch of people in the movie! How can that remotely make sense in the divine context of the story? Well, it actually does make sense … when we understand that the movie is meant to sell a new religion dictated by the world elite composed of values it wants the masses to adopt. One of these values is that human life is cancer on Earth that needs to be eradicated. In other words, they want humans to sincerely believe they are evil to justify depopulation. Of course, as the movie tells us, most humans do die … EXCEPT those of the chosen bloodline. And that is what the elite wants us to think. We must all die to save the Earth … except them.

Noah is strikingly similar to another movie analyzed on Vigilant Citizen: 2012. As I noted in this article, 2012 is a disaster movie that is essentially about the rich and powerful people (the elite) surviving a gigantic flood while everyone else dies. The movie was full of references to the tale of Noah’s Ark and even shows helicopters transporting various animals to giant ships. The movie posters of Noah and 2012 are also strikingly similar.

Noah is, therefore, a reconstitution of a biblical story tailor-made to fit the Agenda continually being pushed by the elite … and as usual, the Agenda is rather upsetting. It promotes the idea of massively depopulating the Earth and sells it as an ecological mission. Extreme environmentalism is the new religion being sold to the masses through fear.

This religion is not only promoted in works of fiction, it is found in real life monuments. The Georgia Guidestones is a gigantic collection of stones (dubbed America’s Stonehenge) on which are laid out ten NEW commandments.

In the article I wrote about the Guidestones, I explain that it was built by members of occult secret societies. The last commandment of the stones sums up the main message of the movie Noah:

In Noah, it is explained that humanity needs to be extinct because it is disrespectful to nature. That is not what is said in the Bible, but that is the message this movie (and the elite) wants you to absorb.

Right from the first scenes of the movie, Noah (dressed in his little Zara outfit) talks to his kids about hardcore environmental concepts that were probably the last thing on people’s minds in these very ancient times. When Noah’s son sees a pretty flower and tries to pick it, Noah jumps in to stop the senseless destruction.

That little scene announces Noah’s rather extreme brand of environmentalism. A little later, Noah sees “men” (a pejorative term in the movie) hunting an animal in order to eat it. Noah runs to the rescue of the animal and stabs one of the men in the leg. He then calls his act of violence “justice”. Yes, Noah is apparently an extreme vegan who stabs people who eat meat.

When Noah’s son asks him why these evil men believe that eating meat gives them strength, he replies:

This, of course, is not found in the Bible. It is part of the movie’s message that basically says “Animals > Humans”. Throughout the movie, Noah refers to animals as “the innocent” while humans are perceived as scum who deserve to die. Noah, however, seems to forget that many animals are carnivorous beasts who spend most of their time hunting and devouring other animals. Some might say: That is what God intended.

At one point Noah tells his children:

Throughout the movie, Noah, the “hero of the movie” displays absolute hatred for humanity and avoids it at all costs. Every time he sees “men” or man-created structures, he automatically becomes worried.

Twisting the Biblical Bit About the Giants

To further its anti-humanity message, the movie significantly twists and contorts Biblical passages about a mysterious race called the Giants found in the book of Genesis. In the Bible, the Giants are offsprings of a group of 200 “Sons of God” who descended to Earth to mix with humans. They are said to have taught humans advanced skills such as metallurgy, metal working, cosmetics, sorcery, astrology, astronomy, and meteorology. Because the Giants disobeyed God, they were also called the Fallen Angels. (Interesting note: Lucifer is also referred to as a Fallen Angel and is said to have brought forbidden knowledge to men).

In the book of Genesis, it is said that the Giants (also called the Nephilim) were a hybrid race of sons of God and human females.

The Nephilim are described in the Bible (and other apocryphal texts) as a race of giants who lived among humans. They ultimately became a destructive presence and were said to have consumed “all acquisitions of men”. In order to rid these beings from Earth (along with the humans who mixed with them) God caused the Great Flood.

The Bible, therefore, describes the Giants as the main cause of humanity’s corruption. The movie, however, portrays the exact opposite. In Noah, the Giants are described as gentle teachers who came to aid humans, but ultimately became victims of humanity’s cruelty. Later, Giants actually help Noah build the Ark! In short, the movie inverted important parts of the Bible to say that humanity is solely responsible for its demise because it had evolved into a state that was beyond repair. The movie also makes it clear that its anti-humanity message is still applicable today.

In one significant part of the movie, Noah tells his family the “first story he ever heard”. It begins with the first line of the Bible “In the beginning, there was light” but then devolves into a grim speech about the evils of humanity.

The movie, therefore, pushes the viewers to conclude that humanity is, once again, beyond hope. Massive depopulation is therefore not a horrible catastrophe but a necessary “cleansing process”. Noah himself says:

This line is not from the Bible. It comes from the minds of psychopaths who want to depopulate the Earth and describing it as a “cleansing process”. Depopulation is good. Death equals cleansing.

In the end, Noah realizes that not all humanity needs to die after the flood: His family survives. And there lies another important message of the movie: Depopulation does not apply to all humanity. It only applies to those who are not part of the “chosen” bloodline. This is the kind of the message the occult elite wants us to assimilate because they believe THEY are the chosen bloodline.

It’s All About the Bloodline

Spoiler alert: Noah and his family survive the Great Flood. But no one else does. Right from the beginning of the movie, we are told that the survival of humanity must go through a specific bloodline. Viewers immediately learn that Noah descends from Seth while the bad guys descend from Cain – a fact that is apparently VERY important.

Of course, none of this is mentioned in the Bible. It is one of the many fabrications added to flesh out the story and to give it a specific angle: God favors a specific bloodline.

Later in the movie, Noah’s father, Methuselah, is depicted as a reclusive but supernatural being who magically guides Noah through the Creator’s plan. While Methuselah was never mentioned in the Bible as having a role in the construction of the Ark, this addition strengthens the idea of the bloodline.

There are other strange “non-Biblical” additions to the movie that ultimately makes us think that Noah is not a “man of God”, but a jerk who only wants to see his bloodline survive. For instance: Noah actually kills a bunch of people.

In another gut-wrenching (and completely invented) scene, Noah purposely allows his son’s girlfriend to be trampled to death by hundreds of people.

How can a man, that is supposedly chosen by the Creator, allow the death of an innocent girl? Why was this added to the movie? Because it is continuously communicating a message: Whether she was good or not is irrelevant. The girl was not part of the bloodline. Therefore, she must die. It is not about being a good person. It is about who you descend from.

After the flood, Noah turns into a disturbed, depressive, psychopath. When he learns that his daughter-in-law is pregnant, he is convinced that he must kill the little girl to make sure that humanity does not reproduce.

Noah, however, realizes something incredible: He does not feel like stabbing his own granddaughter in the face. Although he first believes that he had let down the Creator by not killing the girl, he ultimately learns that he did the right thing by “showing mercy”. But what about the countless humans he killed? Wasn’t there any mercy for them? No. Because they were not part of the bloodline. The Creator allowed Noah to murder people when they were not “chosen”. Incidentally, that is what the occult elite believes.

The movie depicts Noah’s “divine” quest as a cruel and violent process carried out by a man who is steadily turning into a psychopath. While stranded on the Ark, his own family begins to resent him as he obsesses over the fact that everybody needs to die. While he is merely following the Creator’s orders, he appears to be animated by a deep-seeded hate of humanity, which leaves viewers with an “unholy” feeling. There is, however, a character that counterbalances Noah’s “do it my way or else” doctrine: Tubal-Cain.

Tubal-Cain is the “leader of humans”, and, therefore, Noah’s mortal enemy. While Tubal-Cain is the “bad guy”, he is ironically the character who says the most thoughtful and sensible lines, which causes viewers to somewhat identify with him. Contrarily to Noah, he is not ashamed to be human and is proud of humanity’s accomplishments. Furthermore, he feels somewhat forsaken by the Creator who left his kind to roam a desolate land. He seeks to emancipate himself from the Creator’s rule through his own means. In this sense, he is a representative of a Gnostic point of view that perceives the Creator a demiurge – a lower god who imprisoned mankind in a material world. This is why God is called “the Creator” in the movie. It refers to the Gnostic concept of demiurge, the near-malevolent creator of the material world.

Tubal-Cain is briefly mentioned in the Bible as a “forger of all instruments of bronze and iron” and an “instructor of every artificer in brass and iron”. However, he is never mentioned in the story of the Great Flood and has no link with Noah. So why did the makers of the movie choose this obscure Biblical character to become Noah’s arch-nemesis? Because, while Tubal-Cain is an obscure figure in the Bible, he is an extremely important figure in the most widespread Gnostic Mystery School on Earth: Freemasonry.

Not unlike Hiram Abiff (a leading figure in Masonic lore and ritual), Tubal-Cain is an obscure Biblical figure who takes a great importance in esoteric teachings. As a proficient maker of weapons, he represents humanity’s potential to build its own power – without the Creator. Various Masonic sources describe the esoteric significance of Tubal-Cain.

In Manly P. Hall’s “The Lost Keys of Freemasonry”, Tubal-Cain is described as the “forefather” of Freemasons.

Mystery Schools love Biblical characters who did not rely on God to gain knowledge and power. Tubal-Cain is a prime example. In Noah, Tubal-Cain attempts to communicate with the Creator – not as a servant, like Noah, but as an equal.

Although Tubal-Cain realizes that humanity is about to be wiped away, he finds an unexpected person to carry on his legacy: Noah’s own son, Ham.

Throughout Noah’s quest, Ham feels ignored, rejected and infantilized. He feels that he cannot become a man without being with a woman – a right that is denied by his father. Tired of being punished and humiliated, Ham leaves the Ark and mixes with the “nasty” humans. There, he finds a “good girl” he wants to marry. However, Noah leaves her to die and drags Ham back to the Ark by force.

When Ham meets Tubal-Cain, he finds the kind of father figure he has been looking for. Instead of a life of blind servitude, Tubal-Cain offered Ham the means to be a “real” man. During the flood, Tubal-Cain found a way to sneak inside the Ark and, while hidden with the animals, he “initiated” Ham to his philosophy.

While these words were said by the “bad guy”, he was nearly quoting actual Biblical verses. This only adds to the movie’s general confusion and mixed messages.

Tubal-Cain then ultimately urges Ham to kill his father:

Ham does not kill his father … he kills Tubal-Cain. However, this fateful act does not seem to bother Tubal-Cain. To the contrary, he knows that, by killing him, Ham has successfully completed his initiation. While dying, Tubal-Cain tells Ham:

After surviving the flood, Ham does not reintegrate with Noah’s family. He leaves them behind and makes his own path.

We don’t know if Ham managed to reproduce (probably not). However, we do know that, in the Bible, the story that immediately follows Noah’s Ark is the story of the Tower of Babel – a gigantic tower built by humans to “fight God”. It appears that the Great Flood did not “cleanse” anything and that Tubal-Cain’s lineage survived the Flood after all.

In the Bible, the story of Noah’s Ark is told in a few simple verses and is filled with enigmatic bits that are never explained (i.e. who were the Giants exactly?). The movie Noah fills in the answers to some of these questions in its own way by augmenting the Biblical tale with fabricated stories and characters, ultimately giving this ancient story a very modern twist. The same way Russell Crowe’s snazzy outfits were tailor-made for a 2014 audience, the messages in Noah were also tailor-made for a 2014 audience.

The movie basically presents two philosophical views: One that is meant for the ignorant masses and one that is meant for “those in the know”. The ignorant masses are told to follow a radical brand of environmentalism that leads to self-hatred: Because humanity is the evil force behind war, suffering and the destruction of nature, it needs to be “cleansed”. This message fits with the occult elite’s depopulation Agenda and is embodied by Noah. At the other end of the spectrum, Tubal-Cain represents humans seeking godhood, acquiring the physical and mental tools to reach the same status as the Creator. This is the Gnostic philosophy adopted by the occult elite. While embodied by the “bad guy”, it is nevertheless presented as an alternative to the absurdity of the Creator who created humanity to then destroy it.

In short, Noah is far from an “idiotic” movie (as some reviewers have stated). It manages to sell a New Age religion based on self-hatred while giving a nod to the occult elite, those who fancy themselves to be descendants of Tubal-Cain. But the occult elite does not believe in radical environmentalism OR care about human life. They are the ones behind all our major wars and their greed is the main cause of nature’s destruction. Through movie’s like Noah, they are trying to put the burden of their own wrongdoings on the unsuspecting masses who usually do as they are told. They want us to welcome the idea of a “great cleansing”.

In the Bible, after the Great Flood, God himself states :

So, whether you believe in the Bible or not, know that if there is another major “cleansing” on Earth, it will not come from “the Creator”. It will come from those who have brainwashed you for years, convincing you to believe you are a cancer on Earth.",conspiracy,C01b84,big.foot
21,331,"Inspired by Caroliens experience with the mini-108; I decided to make one myself.I marked it out on a piece of plywood in a very simple way; Just made an 18 of the appropriate size on a sheet of paper like this:Then cut a square meter of plywood; set the paper template on it and poked through each of the 18 points in turn using a bradawl before moving the paper on to its next position until all seven 18s were marked with little holes on the plywood:I then stuck a tiny TB to each point using contact adhesive and it was done.As I was positioning the final few mini-TBs; a fresh blustery wind started blowing and Sylphs began to appear in numbers.At dusk; three small lenticular clouds appeared in the sky right above the 108 but it was already too dark to take a photograph.Today the Sylphs arrived again in numbers and we even had a visit from a black helicopter around midday.As night falls once more; the sky is filled with unseasonal rainclouds..The individual TBs are no bigger than a bottle-top and yet the sum total appears to be profoundly positive.Dan.

Good job, Carolien--I'm blown away by the quality of the work! My patterns are kind of crude by comparison.Our business was under radionics assault a month ago, characterized by sharply, suddenly dwindled orders. On the day when I set up a 108 the orders started coming in as before and stayed steady until a week ago, when I delivered that 108 to Dooney and Steve. Then the orders dwindled again, for Carol and I. I'm waiting for some feedback from Dooney and Stevo, since they are also under constant radionics assault. The other business person, besides Carolien, who is particularly targetted that way is Andy Schwarm of ctbusters.com . I'm not happy that we're being perpetually smacked by the CIA and NSA this way but I'm glad nobody else among our associates evidently is.I'm making another pattern, now, and will make some trick, conical orgonite bits for each of the 108 points. I'll use TBs sort of like Andy's, this time, and will add nice crystals and spiral coils inside. Cones and pyramids have almost equal energy dynamics, evidently, and I bet the cone shape will really blast out. I don't mind the lull in business, much, because I hadn't been able to get ahead with production, so my personal life was suffering. I'm definitely NOT a workaholic.It's still early to make any claims for this device, which was invented by Cesco, based perhaps on Kelly's earlier field experiments.Promoting it is a little bit dicey because Cesco hasn't mentioned whether he favors others profitting from this intellectual property. Also, when he was last here, a year and a half ago, he was uncertain whether an identical orgonite piece should go in the center of each of the seven hexagram 'cells,' which would make the number, 115 rather than 108.Just because Carol and I long ago gave away the plans for orgonite cloudbbusters, the Succor Punch, Powerwand, the Big Secret, Holy Handgrenades and Towerbusters doesn't mean that it's appropriate for other inventors to give away their creations, of course. I'm sure not giving away the formulas for the 'secret ingredients' of our own commercial offerings, after allbecause we want to keep a competitive edge and there is always more than one way to accomplish anything.That said, I'd be very pleased if it's appropriate for Carolien to market these beautiful templates and perhaps the orgonite that goes on them. Since the orgonite is interactive I think it would be productive to boost it with gems, coils, etc., in an intelligent way.The only way to get a good idea of the device's parameters is to get a whole lot of them in the hands of people who are in a position to give substantive feedback. That's how we test our own mods before we decide to market them.~Don

In last weeks chat, Don mentioned that he had made a small 108 (a little over a square meter) to stop radionics on his biz and was making some more to help out Stevo, Dooney and others. Radionics are often used to put a dome over our businesses, to make them invisible for customers. Frequently we boost each others biz to clear these etheric fogs.I couldn't wait to make my own 108 and started the next day making a template on paper, using the picture Cesco once posted on EW (enlarged 6 times for the square meter endresult):See picture on whale.to page: http://www.whale.to/b/108_h.html However, taping the twentyfour pages together into one print, turned out rather messy. Despite my tongue in cheek effort, the circle became all crooked. Using my compasses to draw the 108 on another sheet, left me with a buzzing headache of all the measurements. I sure lost my touch with maths!So in the end, I gave myself a break and ordered a weatherproof outdoor poster of the 108 template on pvc sheet. This Dutch company makes a 110x110cm sheet for about 108 euroA perfect size for using half size tb's with 5cm diameter. It is quite easy (and cheaper) to have one made by a company in your own country - just look for vinyl outdoor poster/banner sellers on the Internet, there are lots! Many outdoor poster sellers have a download option for your own picture on a banner. All you have to do is:1) download the 108 picture on http://www.whale.to/b/108_h.html 2) enlarge it 6 times on your own computer (to match the approximate square meter)3) and order a banner at the size to fit the enlarged templateHere is my finished 108 - well, almost finished, I had to make one more small tb...It is too soon to tell wether it is really working against the radionics on my biz. It hasn't been up for a day yet. But for what it's worth: my computer screen stopped flickering for the first time in a year (I had grown accustomed to that flickering! Thought it was due to old age. Hopefully it doesn't start tomorrow again, hehe). Physically, I felt my feet charka burning healthy unlike I have experienced in over a year too. So far, so good. I will report more in time.It would be my pleasure to order a template for EW members. Since we all are radionics targets, our observations might be worthwhile. Please PM me for that.Carolien

 Of course there is a strong and somewhat founded suspicion that certain geometries or shapes have particular energy signatures. After all, ancient traditions have put great emphasis on the study of sacred geometry. But we don't just want to jump onto the new age bandwagon and get prematurely very excited. We leave that to the wannabe Gurus, ok? 

 The final kick to overcome my natural inertia and get busy with this experiment came from the feedback that some of the first experimentors gave: 

 The energy of this setup is appartently very strong and could give extended protection against all kinds of etheric interference. 

 

 Since we are constantly aware of such interference being directed at us, it was a no brainer to get us started.

 And after sticking them on and putting the board upright, just standing in front of it, I must say: Wow! 

 

 

 Wow, I have never felt anything like it! 

 

 In a way it felt like being hit by direct sunlight, but much more pleasant and energising. (and sunlight is already pleasant, I think) But this light does not stay on the surface of your skin, it goes right through, embracing all molecules of your body. The whole space feels lit up and energized. 

 Also there is a sensation of a very high frequency sound, but it's not in the ear. 

 We have hung it on the wall of our kitchen which serves as our dinng room as well. Whenever I walk past it, I feel compelled to stand in front of it and spead the arms in order to soak up that energy. 

 

 The night after it was finished, I went into the EW chat and asked the psychics if they could pick up some interference on our business, because I had a week with very low orders and it felt like one of the usual radionics blockades we so frequently have to put up with. The feedback I got from Axel that evening was, that the energy of the new 108 is so strong, it has already blasted away all interference. 

 

 Finished and klaar then as we say in South Africa? 

 

 A day later I went to visit our highly psychic friend Valda and on just telling her about it, she could tune into the energy and confirmed that it's extremely powerful. 

 I'm still ""under the influence"", but I suggest you follow the discussion on EW and in the etheric science forum.

We are pretty familiar with what 108 TBs do on their own, as we always have a few 100 on our premises.Friederike lovingly waterclolouring the designOf course there is a strong and somewhat founded suspicion that certain geometries or shapes have particular energy signatures. After all, ancient traditions have put great emphasis on the study of sacred geometry. But we don't just want to jump onto the new age bandwagon and get prematurely very excited. We leave that to the wannabe Gurus, ok?The final kick to overcome my natural inertia and get busy with this experiment came from the feedback that some of the first experimentors gave:The energy of this setup is appartently very strong and could give extended protection against all kinds of etheric interference.Since we are constantly aware of such interference being directed at us, it was a no brainer to get us started.Georg sticking them onAnd after sticking them on and putting the board upright, just standing in front of it, I must say: Wow!Wow, I have never felt anything like it!In a way it felt like being hit by direct sunlight, but much more pleasant and energising. (and sunlight is already pleasant, I think) But this light does not stay on the surface of your skin, it goes right through, embracing all molecules of your body. The whole space feels lit up and energized.Also there is a sensation of a very high frequency sound, but it's not in the ear.We have hung it on the wall of our kitchen which serves as our dinng room as well. Whenever I walk past it, I feel compelled to stand in front of it and spead the arms in order to soak up that energy.The night after it was finished, I went into the EW chat and asked the psychics if they could pick up some interference on our business, because I had a week with very low orders and it felt like one of the usual radionics blockades we so frequently have to put up with. The feedback I got from Axel that evening was, that the energy of the new 108 is so strong, it has already blasted away all interference.Finished and klaar then as we say in South Africa?A day later I went to visit our highly psychic friend Valda and on just telling her about it, she could tune into the energy and confirmed that it's extremely powerful.I'm still ""under the influence"", but I suggest you follow the discussion on EW and in the etheric science forum.____________

My previous post in this thread reads like an unbridled endorsement of the 108. 

 I would like to report that my opinion has been modified somewhat in the light of more recent experience with the device. 

 

 Following my initial glowing impressions of its effects (mostly on the sky); I began to notice a number of more negative changes in the area. 

 

 The sky became hazy and cloudless and the wind dropped; rather in the way it does during a concerted chemtrail attack (but there were no chemtrails) and the Sylphs completely disappeared. 

 

 We each began to exhibit classic symptoms of the effects of DOR (headaches, poor sleep patterns, listlessness and lack of inspiration) all highly unusual given the quantity of orgonite in the area. 

 

 It was almost as though the three CBs in my garden had all stopped working in unison. 

 

 After a few days; my suspicions fell on the wonderful 108 that everyone (myself included) was raving about. 

 

 Id assembled it with meticulous precision from small pieces of simple orgonite so there could be nothing wrong with the stone-combinations or coils as there were none (also the drawing was both correct and accurately drafted). 

 

 The easy way to find out was to simply take it away from its then horizontal position (where the energy vortex was presumably effecting the sky) and stand it upright against the workshop wall. 

 

 Almost immediately the gentle breeze returned and the sky slowly cleared and it seemed that the CBs were beginning to work normally again. 

 

 The subjective negative effects on each of us continued though and Id find myself staring into space when there were things to be done; apparently lost for an idea. 

 

 Finally I dismantled the 108 and put the component pieces away. 

 All the negative effects evaporated and the area returned to normal (and has remained this way ever since). 

 

 As I say; I do not know where to attribute the source of this negativity; given the wholesale endorsement of the 108 by a range of experienced orgonite experimenters, some of whom have posted in this thread. 

 

 The only other 108 I ever made was constructed from lawn-busters (orgonite spikes that are trodden into soft ground). 

 Each spike of orgonite contained a Cesco coil and a quartz chip and I set them in the soil (EP-style) with a hammer. 

 

 On that occasion; I remember a fresh blustery breeze starting as I had nearly completed the arrangement and initial good effects on the atmosphere. 

 

 For some reason I became disaffected with that initial 108 and eventually dug it out of the ground and threw the pieces in the Bali Strait on a trip to Java. 

 

 I didnt suspect the integrity of the 108 matrix at that time and just assumed that there must have been a conflict between so many coils set in close proximity to each other. 

 

 I do not pretend to understand these negative effects of the 108 and I realize that this is not the first time that my findings have been completely at odds with the general consensus on this forum. 

 

 I hope that others do not experience anything similar and that the 108 continues to get rave reviews. 

 

 I would however be dishonest if I allowed my earlier impressions of the device to stand uncorrected. 

 

 Dan. 

 

 

 

 





 

 Kelly has reminded me that this is not his invention, by the way. I think I was giving the impression that it is. This is Cesco's tentative presentation and Kelly has gone on to experiment with a 114 arrangement. 

 

 So far, we've had nothing but good experiences with ours, as have Dooney and STevo and one or two others. 

 

 We looked closely at your problem in Dooney's chatroom, yesterday, and focused mainly on the unhappy entity that Kelly found on/under your property. Stevo evidently got into a dialog with this one and all the psychics had the impression that the entity is an elemental who is extremely displeased with the world order's manipulation and sabotage of Bali's energy field, also not able or willing to distinguish that from your own engineering. 

 

 Francie, early on, clearly saw a witch doctor looking closely at you these days and that one is probably associated with the elemental & anxious about the technology you're using. 

 

 Bali is the only island in that enormous archipelago, as far as I know, whose inhabitants have mostly held to the older ways and didn't embrace Islam when Arab merchants and scholars went there so many centuries ago. I think it was only the Turks and perhaps Moghuls who forced conversion to Islam, which was very much against Muhammad's teachings. 

 

 The style of Hinduism in Bali seems to me like the more ancient animism that we see in Tibetan Buddhism and Shintoism, which may be to say that the 'older ways' involve close cooperation with elementals. A nice confirmation of that may be the way that the Shinto priests whom Tetsuzi-san met were eager to accept his orgonite gifts for their shrine/vortex; they immediately understood the energy and its uses. 

 

 Stevo evidently worked out a deal with your elemental room mate to let you reassemble the 108 and keep it going for three months, if you're willing. He promised not to interfere during that time while he evaluates it. 

 

 We had an awful lot of fun in that chat session, by the way. Francie's past exposure to Jesuits at college in Georgetown produced some Jesuit predators in a murder ritual, which we also dealt with in the session. I had a notion to 'offer' these child-murderers to that elemental on your property as a gift and Stevo said he accepted. We expressed our love to the elemental who the psychics said was very surprised to find Westerners who honored him/her/it. 

 

 We operate on the assumption that elementals are neither good nor bad but are certainly essential to all the workings of our planet. This is unspeakably weird to mainstream folks but when one is willing to loose the shackles of conventionality it's a whole lot of fun and also empowering to interact with elementals, most of whom love orgonite, after all. 

 

 Your situation reminded me of the big elementals Carol and I encountered on Andros Island in the Bahamas, where we went to gift the blue holes. The Bahamians on that island have gotten pretty far from their African roots and are quite churchified, so they seem to hate and fear the elementals there. Carol immediately got the impression that they hated people on account of it but as soon as we started tossing orgonite out into the very dense bush for them, then into the blue holes over the next few days. I heard them as galloping horses, which didn't surprise me even though you can't penetrate more than a few inches into that jungle without a bulldozer and they were obviously very happy that some people finally acknowledged them. I think the orgonite also toned down the churchy people's paranoia about these nature guardians, too. 

 

 Your case is absolutely unique, Dan, but I encourage you to avoid making assumptions about the devices and will rather consider the more hidden dynamics. We want to help you resolve this. I think that if the problem were rather with the technology then we'd have heard reports like this from other stable and reputable people but you're the only one so there's obviously something else going on. 

 

 Kelly did a great job identifying the source of your previous trouble and it might be useful for you to get acquainted with some traditional magicians on Bali if the opportunity arises. If the old ways on Bali were not valid I doubt the people could have kept those traditions into modern times and I like to honor people who do that. There are a few other cultures around the world who have achieved this. The Black Caribs (Garifuna) of Central America are one and I found them quite endearing. There are lots of them in Africa and rural Asia where Big Religion clergy haven't bludgeoned people into superstition and paranoia about natural forces. 

 

 A witch doctor in the mountains of North Thailand sent an emissary to get instructions for making orgonite from Eddie-san when he was vacationing there a few years ago. They didnt' know each other and as far as I know Eddie hasn't gotten any followup. 

 

 I had the opportunity to receive a lot of similar stories/teachings from Dorothy the Witch, who was one of a 3,000 year family line of witches from Wales and perhaps a longer line of medicine people from the Seneca tribe. She has travelled to over 40 countries in a synchronous way and was sought out by members of ancient, benevolent secret orders in most of those. We could learn a lot about synchronicity from folks like these if we're fortunate enough to know them. 

 

 A group of kindly witches gave protection to Carol and her associates when they arrived in rural Kenya 8 years ago and I believe if it weren't for that, the malevolent 'night runners' would have harmed one or more of them, then. 

 

 This is the hidden world which orgonite suits us to behold and appreciate if we'll open ourselves to it. Some of us need to abandon certain prejudices in order to venture there, of course.

 Research implies a sort of commitment. Carol and I have been experimenting with orgonite for over ten years and we've personally never seen evidence that orgonite can produce harmful effects in any configuration. The only orgonite that makes balanced people even mildly uncomfortable are the intentionally disharmonious products made and sold by a few disreputable orgonite vendors and they achieve that by skillfully combining elements that are not harmonious with each other. One is very unlikely to 'achieve' those effects accidently or stupidly. I suppose there will always be people who lack discernment on a level that makes them susceptible to the hypnotic effects of charismatic scoundrels like those but 'caveat emptor.' 

 

 Maybe an aspect of commitment is to decide to trust that our orgonite devices are not going to do any harm, so when we get psyched out and are tempted to destroy or dismantle an orgonite device we can perhaps consider that those thoughts are implanted rather than our own. The corporate psychiatrists in Freud's frightful Tavistock tradition work pretty hard to stampede people who are in a position to make the world better, after all. 

 

 Powering through doubt and uncertainty with some commitment can often produce real gems of new insights, too. It's always better if we discover these on our own, through our own observations and efforts, than to get them second hand. 

 

 One of the psychics noted that the corporate freaks seem desperate to find a way to overcome the positive effects of the 108, so we ought to expect a little strangeness in our vicinity. As far as we can tell, the harder they try the harder they're falling and it seems to us that this network is turning yet another corner with this new approach: sacred geometry configurations of simple orgonite. I never could have predicted this because, before, the only folks shouting about sacred geometry were high-profile, charismatic scoundrels 

 

 I guess the obvious 'next step' when seeing manifestations of the corporate predators' displeasure in our vicinity is to see whether it dissipates on its own and how quickly. My hunch is that the more they can throw at any orgonite device, the quicker it will dissipate. 

 

 Dan, I also haven't heard anyone else report bad effects from chemtrail spraying in many years, except from the chemtrails that are sprayed below the clouds and that's quite rare by now. When the atmosphere has a lot of water in it, the chemtrails seed longer-lasting clouds and this certainly creates a psychological effect in some folks. When I see a long-lasting chemtrail-seeded cloud I actually applaud the corporate predators' tecchies because it's hard for them to achieve that here, as it probably also is where you live. I think they're constantly experimenting with new , ematerials and they bring it to bear most aggressively in places like Bali, where they've lost the most ground to orgonite. 

 

 I saw one such long-lived cloud across our sky, last week, that partly dropped below the spew altitude but when I saw it a few minutes later, the cloud had flattened and was already dissipating. I like to remind folks who email me about their fear of chemtrails that there's usually one plane spewing the evil stuff in with the other planes that are just seeding transient clouds and the evil (bioweapon?) chemtrails are the ones that disappear almost instantaneously, I believe. Just about everyone, by now, lives in range of at least one cloudbuster so the evil spew is disappearing fast everywhere, now. The Chicken Little disinfo sites are the source of most of the residual chemtrail terror, of course, and the vast majority of people who see chemtrails, now, didn't notice them when they were still sickening and killing people, many years ago. They looked and behaved quite differently, then. I should probably post about that, again. Sometimes repitition is necessary. 

 

 Also, when there's a lot of water in the atmosphere, making seeded clouds possible, the atmospheric pressure is sometimes low and that's also associated with relative depression and ennui. I hope this helps! 

 

 Manfred and associates are demonstrating on ethericresearch.com how patient and observant we each need to be to explore any of these phenomena in a thorough and intelligent way. This is in sharp contrast to the way so many of us were blindly jumping to imitate and promote untested claims and tools when a charismatic personality was the source. I think we've come a long way and it makes me very proud of everyone here.

 CArolien mentioned, in the chat, that dark clouds gathered in the sky near her, recently, and she also wondered if this was an effect of the 108. After all, Holland probably has the densest concentration of orgonite cloudbusters of any country, also perhaps the highest percentage of gifted death towers and weather weapons.Research implies a sort of commitment.

 I didnt want to post about it prematurely, because going public with observations often has its own dynamics, while temporarily disassembling the 108 was intended to pace myself in the process of understanding its possible interactions. 

 

 Also, including the 108 in the reduction of possible outside influences  to check if all this was interference or perhaps some personal process  was a reluctant thing for me to do, for I was so curious about its possible effects in dissolving negative thoughtforms, as reported by Carol. 

 

 Then Francie emailed an observation that swept me in doubt about the corruption resistance of a 108 and made me decide to temporarily remove it. I better post part of her email here as a quote, to not loose words in translation. 

 

 I can already see some occult geometry being put over your location.... I looked and saw this geometry again last night. As I approached the geometry it flashed and I saw bloody bulls' horns and spring/early summer fields. I think that was the energy of this spell being made. I know biodynamic farmers still use the energy of the horns in their fields. What I saw over you would be a corruption of this very old abundance/growth/fulfillment power ritual. 

 

 In previous observations, Francie and Bob had seen my sleep deprivations derive from astral projections during sleep. Part of me had been flying in the 108 vortex and somehow been captured, by the spell and my own lack of grounding (thus the fear of going to sleep). Things felt a 100% better and back to normal after Francie had removed this geometric overlay. But that left me in doubt whether this could happen again, as you perhaps can understand. 

 

 Anyhow, all this kick-started a serious commitment to exploring my own habits of thought and disciplining myself into more positive think. As I said in the bugs post, it reminded me of experiencing George Orwells room 101 (1984), where people are tortured with their own fears until they give up their concept of reality. 

 

 After disassembling the 108, the only outside influence left was my detox program. I need to add this and risk more controversy  for this detox had a profound effect on my tendency to think in negative circles. It convinced me that parasites have a role in maintaining negative thoughtforms, for which we blame our character. 

 

 My 108 is up again. I feel strong enough to take more occult spells to test if they really can corrupt a 108s energy or see if I can manage myself now. As for the interaction, both Francie and Dooney saw my 108 more grounded now. Maybe its all part of a personal process, who knows? This etheric world leaves me flabbergasted all the time. But thoughtforms seem to be very real! Now I am curious how much happiness I can take 

 

 

 

 

 Dan, I have to back you up to some extend  that is, Ive also disassembled my 108 for a few weeks. Mainly because, at some point, there was too much going on (as posted here and here ) for me to discern what caused what. Especially the thought-manifestation occurrences confused me. Believe me, the amount of bugs manifesting was not funny and I felt like a wicked witch for the way my negative thoughts became instant reality to people around me. So, besides disassembling the 108 I also disconnected every SP and other possible thought-enhancing equipment in the house  to gradually build things up again, one by one, and see what would happen.I didnt want to post about it prematurely, because going public with observations often has its own dynamics, while temporarily disassembling the 108 was intended to pace myself in the process of understanding its possible interactions.Also, including the 108 in the reduction of possible outside influences  to check if all this was interference or perhaps some personal process  was a reluctant thing for me to do, for I was so curious about its possible effects in dissolving negative thoughtforms, as reported by Carol.Then Francie emailed an observation that swept me in doubt about the corruption resistance of a 108 and made me decide to temporarily remove it.

 In august my girlfriend and I spent our holidays in Sweden. We did some gifting there but we also spent some days with fishing, campfire ect.. One evening we came back from the lake with our canoe because there were dark clouds on the sky. We left the canoe down by the lake and went a small way up to our cottage. Only a few steps before we reached the cottage there was a small wooden electricity pylon(maybe 7m high). When we were walking directly near that pylon I looked up and in that moment I saw a lightning flash on the top of the pylon immediately followed by an enormous clap of thunder. Everything was turned into blue light. Anna saw everything in pink light. We had big luck to be still alive, I think ... and it had been the only lightning in the environment of our house on that evening. When the lighting stroke we had a big Orgonite ( 5 kg) in our canoe (that we used as an anchor) about 100 m down by the lake and a HHG in the cottage . We both wore the harmonic protector. (we wear the HP's day and night since the day we had got them). When I read your article , Manfred, I remembered that occurence and I thought that possibly the lightning had been an attack... ....

 My posting does not referr to the 108 but when when i read your posting, Manfred, I immediatly remembered a situation that happenend a few weeks ago so I want to share it .In august my girlfriend and I spent our holidays in Sweden.

We left the canoe down by the lake and went a small way up to our cottage. Only a few steps before we reached the cottage there was a small wooden electricity pylon(maybe 7m high). When we were walking directly near that pylon I looked up and in that moment I saw a lightning flash on the top of the pylon immediately followed by an enormous clap of thunder. Everything was turned into blue light. Anna saw everything in pink light. We had big luck to be still alive, I think ... and it had been the only lightning in the environment of our house on that evening. When the lighting stroke we had a big Orgonite ( 5 kg) in our canoe (that we used as an anchor) about 100 m down by the lake and a HHG in the cottage . We both wore the harmonic protector. (we wear the HP's day and night since the day we had got them). When I read your article , Manfred, I remembered that occurence and I thought that possibly the lightning had been an attack.......Moritz",conspiracy,C023fe,big.foot
22,1041,"Three unmistakable signs that WAR is coming to America: Pompeo orders all American citizens to “immediately” return to the USA

By now, you know that I was more than a month ahead of virtually all media — independent and mainstream — in warning about the coming coronavirus pandemic. When I first released projections of 10,000 deaths in America by May 10th, nearly everyone thought the idea was insane (probably including you). As it turns out, we are likely to have over 100,000 deaths by May 10th, according to what the White House is now saying.

This is worth mentioning because today we have a new warning about where things are headed. There have been three unmistakable signs that war is coming to the United States very soon. Those signs have all emerged in the past week, all with a sense of urgency that goes far beyond any concern about a pandemic:

Sign #1) President Trump activating one million military reservists with medical skills to treat battlefield injuries. Details of this order are found in the EO text at WhiteHouse.gov.

Sign #2) The Pentagon ordering high-level staffers into deep underground bunkers in Colorado. This was announced by NORAD and NORTHCOM in a Facebook town hall meeting. Obviously, you don’t order military staffers into a 2,000-foot deep bunker just because of a virus.

Sign #3) Secretary of State Pompeo just ordered all Americans living overseas to return to the US “immediately.” The cover story for this is that the coronavirus is collapsing international flights. But that alone would not justify all Americans returning from living overseas, since many Americans would just hunker down where they’re living. But Pompeo wants all Americans to return immediately, which is the kind of thing you do before a war breaks out (with China, most likely). Via The UK Independent:

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged Americans abroad who still wish to return to the United States to do so “immediately,” saying commercial and government-chartered flights could soon cease amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Donald Trump’s top diplomat urged any Americans abroad who want to get back to US soil to contact the American embassy in the country where they currently are to begin making plans “immediately” to get a flight back to the States.

That’s because Pompeo doesn’t want to end up negotiating for the release of American prisoners being held by the communist Chinese regime, obviously. Any American reading this who is still in China or Hong Kong should strongly consider bugging out. By the way, we were also told weeks ago from another source that China has already begun executing anti-communist leaders in Hong Kong, which now seems to be preparation for the global war that’s about to happen next.

These three events are unmistakable signs that high-level officials within the Pentagon and US State Department anticipate actions of war in the very near future. China is the most likely adversary, especially given that China probably released the Wuhan coronavirus in the first place, knowing that America would have a much more difficult time locking down cities compared to China itself, which we now believe may have lost millions of citizens despite its best efforts to contain the virus.

Notably, the Wuhan coronavirus, released by China, has managed to cripple the US Navy by infecting sailors on aircraft carriers and other vessels. This is not an accident. It’s part of the “softening up” phase to weaken America in advance of the attack.

Expect an attack on America when the nation reaches “peak pandemic” health chaos and economic disruptions

The ideal time for a foreign enemy to attack the United States would be when our nation is in the throes of economic collapse and a pandemic medical emergency. According to estimates announced by the White House today, coronavirus-related deaths will peak in the USA on April 12th, but lockdowns will continue through the end of April, causing financial reverberations to echo across the nation for many months yet to come.

The White House currently expects up to 240,000 Americans to die from the coronavirus over the next several months. (Our own estimates top out at just 90,000 fatalities, by the way.)

Due to the coronavirus crunch, joblessness, homelessness and rising social unrest will sow chaos across the landscape of America for the remainder of the year (and well into 2021), and that doesn’t even count whatever political chaos might be added to the mix surrounding the coming November elections. Plus, there are food shortages that are starting to become very real, while a massive wave of price inflation for consumer goods will appear soon thanks to the trillions of dollars in bailout money that Trump and the Fed just threw at the economy.

With one-third of the US Congress now run by communist China — and most of the left-wing media making excuses for China and trying to shift the coronavirus blame to Trump — it’s clear that China’s longstanding desire to infiltrate and destroy the United States of America has reached a tipping point. They will likely pull the trigger soon, which could mean economic warfare (selling all US debt and announcing a new gold-backed world reserve currency), kinetic warfare (an actual land invasion of Chinese troops hitting the beaches in California), nuclear warfare (or an EMP weapon detonated above North America), or even new waves of biological warfare (SARS-cov-3, SARS-cov-4, etc.). And don’t forget cyber warfare, a favorite of the tech-savvy communist regime.

We don’t know exactly what’s coming, but we know the leadership in America believes something big is about to happen. Otherwise, none of the actions listed above would have been taken.

Ramp up your preparedness to a whole new level, if you can

Prepare for all the following, just in case one or more happen:
• A blackout of all internet and phone communications
• Foreign troops invading the US, including through the Mexico border
• Attempted assassination of President Trump, or a possible “civil war” inside the Pentagon
• The possibility of mass arrests of deep state traitors who are Chinese collaborators, such as Sen. Feinstein, Gov. Newsom, etc.

We cannot be certain that any of these will happen, and we hope none of them do. But there are giant red flashing warning signs just screaming out that something big is about to go down. The only two scenarios that make sense are a WAR with a foreign enemy or possibly the initiation of a domestic civil war (or perhaps both).

If you thought encountering a purchase limit on toilet paper was the worst problem you might encounter this year, think again. JR Nyquist explains why China is just itching to destroy the United States and has long been planning to use a biological weapon to soften up America in advance of the military attack wave:

23,1211,"Sprite Argentina (owned by The Coca-Cola Company) recently released on its social media platforms an ad titled Orgullo (translated to Pride) which depicts several scenarios involving parents and their gender dysphoric children dressing up as the opposite sex. Set to the emotional song You’ll Never Walk Alone, the ad depicts the premature sexualization of children as a wholesome family activity.

Here are some of the key scenes:

The fact that we see this woman tightly strapping on this undergarment as emotional music plays in the background is odd. One of the many reasons this is odd: Binding breasts leads to important health risks.

Binding for extended periods of time can lead to rashes or yeast infections under the breasts, back or chest pain, shortness of breath, overheating, or fractured ribs. Unsafe binding may lead to permanent deformation of the breasts, scarring, and lung constriction and long-term binding may adversely affect the outcome of a future mastectomy. In one study, 97.2% of those surveyed had some sort of health problem caused by binding.

 – Wikipedia, “Binding”

In another scene, there is more body-tightening going on.

In the 20th century, corsets were deemed dangerous and “instruments of female torture”.

This ad is not merely about “pride” or “diversity”, it is about pushing an agenda. It is about involving minors in it and shaming parents who do not actively get involved in it.

An Agenda is Being Pushed

The gender-blurring agenda has been identified on this site several years ago and it keeps getting stronger. We know that there’s an “agenda” (which means “an underlying often ideological plan or program”) going on because:
• It is over-represented in mass media
• It is pushed by powerful actors
• It targets minors (and their parents) intentionally.

Here are some recent examples:

If you believe that global corporations such as Coca-Cola create social ads because “they care”, you are dead wrong. They don’t. They are pushing an agenda that was precisely calculated and thought-out by powerful think tanks to shape and mold a new generation. What they are actually looking for is confusion, anxiety, insecurity and a general feeling of disconnection towards everything that is real. And they are succeeding.

US Suicide Pilot Joe Stack Named First “Gray Champion” Of 21st Century

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

In a move sure to bring both shock and fear to the ruling classes of , especially their government officials, the American Patriot Community has named suicide pilot Joe Stack as their “first Gray Champion of the 21st Century”.

According to the American Patriot website GrayChampion.Com, by Joe Stack’s piloting his plane into the Echelon Federal Building this past week he “has fired the first shot in the New American Revolution.”

“Gray Champion’s are also those rarest of Americans, arising to stand among their fellow citizens to “do their duty” on an average of once or twice every generation….a time that has come, once again, as the future of the United States hangs in the balance.

The true determination of who can be called a Gray Champion rests with history as these rarest of Americans were during their times, and by the actions they performed, were always labeled as terrorists, rebels, murderers and traitors and held up for scorn by the elite classes, government officials and media barons who were the targets of these Gray Champions in the first place.”

In our previous report about the actions of Joe Stack (and actually when we had first heard of the American moniker “Gray Champion”) to strike back against a government he believed no longer served the true interests of its citizens, we quoted from his “manifesto” delivered to the World upon his death, and wherein he said:

“I can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be white washed and ignored that the American zombies wake up and revolt; it will take nothing less. I would only hope that by striking a nerve that stimulates the inevitable double standard, knee-jerk government reaction that results in more stupid draconian restrictions people wake up and begin to see the pompous political thugs and their mindless minions for what they are.

Sadly, though I spent my entire life trying to believe it wasn’t so, but violence not only is the answer, it is the only answer. The cruel joke is that the really big chunks of shit at the top have known this all along and have been laughing, at and using this awareness against, fools like me all along.”

To the fears of Joe Stack and his fellow American citizens of their living in a country whose government no longer serves them, but in chilling fact sees them all as enemies and has begun targeting them for destruction, the evidence is becoming overwhelming, and as we can read:

As reported by the ABC Television News Service in their February 3rd article titled “License to Kill? Intelligence Chief Says U.S. Can Take Out American Terrorists” they report:

“The director of national intelligence affirmed rather bluntly today that the U.S. intelligence community has authority to target American citizens for assassination if they present a direct terrorist threat to the United States.

“We take direct actions against terrorists in the intelligence community; if … we think that direct action will involve killing an American, we get specific permission to do that,” Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair told the House Intelligence Committee.”

Based upon US Intelligence Director Blair’s testimony to Congress, and should the American government had discovered Joe Stack’s plan to attack the Echelon Federal Building in Texas, they had the right to assassinate him instead of arresting him and bringing him to trial, and which flies in the face of every standard the United States was built upon, not to mention its being against their own laws and Constitution.

And it gets worse…

In a just released report (February 19th) titled “Bush Lawyer Said President Could Order Civilians to Be 'Massacred'” by the American news magazine Newsweek it is said:

“The chief author of the Bush administration's ""torture memo” told Justice Department investigators that the president's war-making authority was so broad that he had the constitutional power to order a village to be ""massacred”, according to a report by released Friday night by the Office of Professional Responsibility.”

To those Americans believing that their government would never result to the wholesale massacring of them they are warned to think twice, especially when viewed in the light of a just released article by the US Newswire Service titled “1,000 Architects & Engineers Call for New 9/11 Investigation” and which, in part, says:

“Richard Gage, AIA, architect and founder of the non-profit Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth, Inc. (AE911Truth), will announce a decisive milestone today at a press conference in San Francisco, as more than 1,000 worldwide architects and engineers now support the call for a new investigation into the destruction of the Twin Towers and Building 7 at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. After careful examination of the official explanation, along with the forensic data omitted from official reports, these professionals have concluded that a new independent investigation into these mysterious collapses is needed.

Gage and his group base their conclusions on forensic evidence. Gage states, ""The official FEMA and NIST reports provide insufficient, contradictory, and fraudulent accounts of the circumstances of the towers' destruction. We are therefore calling for a grand jury investigation of NIST officials. Gage points out the destruction of the third high-rise, World Trade Center 7, a 47-story skyscraper which was not hit by an aircraft, yet came down in pure free-fall acceleration for more than 100 feet, a significant fact that NIST has been forced to admit, due to research conducted by AE911Truth petition signers. Other disturbing facts emerging from the forensic evidence include:

Complete destruction of both Twin Towers in just 10 to 14 seconds at near free-fall acceleration

Over 100 first-responder reports of explosions and flashes at onset of destruction

1200-foot-dia. debris field: no ""pancaked"" floors seen in the debris pile

Several tons of molten metal found in debris.

Evidence of advanced explosive nano-thermitic composite material found in the WTC dust by an international team of scientists”

Even worse for these Americans are those still believing that President Obama is going to protect them, but which all the evidence clearly shows he is not going to do, in fact, since taking office he has not only continued all of the former President Bush’s policies, he is now actively involved in protecting from prosecution the Bush Administration “architects” of the new Fascist state being created in the United States along with continuing the cover-up of the events surrounding 9/11, and as we can read:

As reported by the Associated Press News Service in their article titled “DOJ review finds no misconduct by memo authors”, Obama overruled his own Department of Justice lawyers who wanted the Bush Administration authors of the so called “torture memos” prosecuted and has allowed them to go unpunished, and as we can read:

“An initial review by the Justice Department's internal affairs unit found that former[Bush] government lawyers Jay Bybee and John Yoo had committed professional misconduct, a conclusion that could have cost them their law licenses. But, underscoring just how controversial and legally thorny the memos have become, the Justice Department's top career lawyer [and close Obama friend] reviewed the matter and disagreed.”

Scarier still about Obama are new reports coming from the US questioning weather he is even in control, and as we can read as reported by the Salon.Com News Service in their report titled “Who's in control in the White House?”, and which, in part, says:

“Recall that one year ago, Obama instructed the DEA to follow his campaign pledge and respect local statutes legalizing medicinal marijuana. When the DEA kept raiding pot dispensaries in states that had passed such laws, Attorney General Eric Holder reiterated the cease and desist decree, stating that ""What (Obama) said during the campaign is now American policy.""

As even more raids nonetheless continued, the Justice Department then issued an explicit memo ordering federal agents to refrain from prosecuting those who are in ""compliance with existing state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana.""

And yet the DEA has recently intensified its crackdown. Here in Colorado -- where voters enshrined medical marijuana's legality in our state constitution -- the feds not only raided two dispensaries, but did so in a way that deliberately humiliated their superiors.

In January, the DEA stormed a company that performs cannabis quality tests. The firm’s alleged infraction? Following protocol and formally applying for a federal equipment license. DEA rogues responded to the request not with thanks or -- heaven forbid -- approval, but instead with the gestapo.

This was topped last week when DEA agents arrested a medical marijuana grower who dared discuss his business with a local news outlet. Sensing a P.R. opportunity, DEA agent Jeffrey Sweetin used the spectacle to insist that he will not listen to stand-down directives from his bosses.”

Now most interesting about all of these events now occurring in the United States, including Joe Stack now being said to be one of the “Gray Champions” of his generation, is that they have been predicted to occur, and as we can read as reported by the Wall Street Journal News Service in their December 29, 2008 article titled “As if Things Weren't Bad Enough, Russian Professor Predicts End of U.S.”, and which says:

“For a decade, Russian academic Igor Panarin has been predicting the U.S. will fall apart in 2010. For most of that time, he admits, few took his argument -- that an economic and moral collapse will trigger a civil war and the eventual breakup of the U.S. -- very seriously. Now he's found an eager audience: Russian state media.

In recent weeks, he's been interviewed as much as twice a day about his predictions. ""It's a record,"" says Prof. Panarin. ""But I think the attention is going to grow even stronger.""

Prof. Panarin, 50 years old, is not a fringe figure. A former KGB analyst, he is dean of the Russian Foreign Ministry's academy for future diplomats. He is invited to Kremlin receptions, lectures students, publishes books, and appears in the media as an expert on U.S.-Russia relations.

But it's his bleak forecast for the U.S. that is music to the ears of the Kremlin, which in recent years has blamed Washington for everything from instability in the Middle East to the global financial crisis. Mr. Panarin's views also fit neatly with the Kremlin's narrative that Russia is returning to its rightful place on the world stage after the weakness of the 1990s, when many feared that the country would go economically and politically bankrupt and break into separate territories.

A polite and cheerful man with a buzz cut, Mr. Panarin insists he does not dislike Americans. But he warns that the outlook for them is dire.

""There's a 55-45% chance right now that disintegration will occur,"" he says. ""One could rejoice in that process,"" he adds, poker-faced. ""But if we're talking reasonably, it's not the best scenario -- for Russia."" Though Russia would become more powerful on the global stage, he says, its economy would suffer because it currently depends heavily on the dollar and on trade with the U.S.

Mr. Panarin posits, in brief, that mass immigration, economic decline, and moral degradation will trigger a civil war next fall and the collapse of the dollar. Around the end of June 2010, or early July, he says, the U.S. will break into six pieces -- with Alaska reverting to Russian control.”

In these most darkest of times, and as the fate of America now hangs in the balance, one can only hope that her people will awaken, and in their awakening arise together, as the one people that they are, so that when the history of these times are written, and though many of them will become their own “Gray Champions”, a new and better Nation may be born again.

25,367,"Strange things are afoot in the animal kingdom. In Sweden, a 16-inch “Ratzilla” burrowed into a family’s home and terrorized them for weeks. In Canada, a two-legged dog jogged down the beach as if it were a human. Our sense of what is possible is expanding every day – could the cryptids, those legendary monsters of folklore, have more grounding in scientific fact than previously assumed?

Probably not. But it’s April Fools’ Day, and that means we can have just as much fun fooling ourselves as we do other people. After all, the world is a more interesting place with these creatures in it.

Join us below as we explore the most intriguing cryptid sightings of 2014 – if they’re real, might they be hiding in your backyard?

The legend of the Chupacabra – a bloodsucking monster that preys on livestock – continues to haunt the Southwest, most recently in March, when a Texas family claimed to have shot and killed a real Chupacabra. With its terrifying teeth and unholy grimace, the animal’s corpse certainly fits the Chupcabra’s description, but local authorities, their hearts dead to the magic of the West, say the creature was likely a local predator infected by Sarcoptic mange.

Bigfoot enthusiasts received a disappointing blow to their efforts on March 28, when self-proclaimed “best Bigfoot tracker in the world” Rick Dyer admitted that his two-year publicity campaign to convince the world he’d killed the beast was a lie. This was the second time Dyer admitted to lying about killing the legendary monster, which raises the question of why anyone trusted him in the first place.

Still, Bigfoot claims are like the Hydra: Knock one down and another three grow in its place. 2014 has already seen Bigfoot sightings in Detroit, Vermont and Maine.

As you may guess from its delightfully folksy moniker, the Yowie is the Australian analogue to Bigfoot, a gigantic hominid rumored to hide in the Australian bush. Given Australia’s remarkable biodiversity and relatively low population density, the Yowie might be slightly easier to believe in than its American relative, particularly among the numerous travelers who have recently reported seeing it in the New South Wales outback.

Conspiracy theorist David Icke has popularized the theory that several world leaders are actually reptilians in disguise, but less cynical cryptid fans have reported seeing lizard people wandering the wilderness in their natural skin, far from the corridors of power. Typical is this account from February, in which a trio of bikers reported encountering a six-foot-tall reptile with clawed hands and snake eyes while traveling through the Arizona desert.

“When you read these stories online or watch them on TV, you think, ‘Man, these people are crazy, or on meds or something,'” CryptoZoologyNews.com quoted one of the bikers as saying. “This story has made me a believer.”

What’s Portugese for “spooky-scary?” The Brazilian Internet blew up in February after security footage of what appeared to be a terrifying wolf figure, complete with tales of frightened locals and security lockdowns, went viral.

The rumors were finally stopped by the Internet equivalent of a silver bullet: A few skeptical sleuths, who noticed that the video dated back to at least 2007. Officials in the town reportedly terrorized by the werewolf said they had no knowledge of any such creature – of course, that’s what they would say.

If a body of water is large enough and deep enough, eventually people are going to start worrying there are monsters in it. The most recent rumblings come from Russia, where a team of scientists has been studying Siberia’s Lake Labynkyr, hoping to find evidence of a mysterious sea creature that fascinated the media in 2013. (Initial reports that those divers found a large jawbone at the bottom of the lake have not been confirmed.)

The “air” inside both bubbles has the stench of Political corruption and fallout from Self Serving actions by an elected official and supposed “public servant.” (Cough, cough… wow, the air is bad in there.)

Not only is Pelosi the “Calendar Girl” (please leave the clothes on) of Liberalism, she is exactly what is wrong with The Political Establishment and why so many ‘left leaning’ voters joined the Republicans and elected Donald Trump as President.

But she also happens to be one of the body’s wealthiest members: In Washington, she lives in a multimillion-dollar Georgetown condo; she owns a 16-acre vineyard in Napa Valley and a 3,700 square-foot house in San Francisco’s tony Pacific Heights..”

“.. financial-disclosure statements, [..] place her in the top one-tenth of the 1 percent of Americans, [that] may surprise some in light of the concern she’s expressed about income equality and the distribution of wealth.

“We’re talking about addressing the disparity in our country of income, where the wealthy people continue to get wealthier,” Pelosi said in 2010 at a United Steelworkers’ event. “That disparity is not just about wages alone,” she added. “That disparity is about ownership and equity. It’s all about fairness in our country.”

At this point we are not going to continue pointing out the hypocrisy Pelosi practices in her personal and business affairs as it is available on line to even the most casual researcher. (Have barf-bag at the ready.)

Short and sweet… Nancy calls out Trump about an alleged Russian Connection without talking about hers.

Nancy says Trump is not competent to be President? Really Nancy? (More Hypocrisy)

27,756,"The sea cows were first described by the German naturalist Georg Steller in the 18th century. Steller was part of an expedition organized led by the Danish explorer Vitus Bering. Financed by the Imperial Russian government, its mission was to chart the waters between Siberia and North America, and find a workable route between the two if possible.

The expedition set sail from Kamchatka in June of 1741. A few weeks later, they had reached Alaska. Bering allowed Steller a single day to search for new species. In that brief time, his only visit to the North American continent, Steller managed to name several species of bird, including Steller’s Jay, ubiquitous in the hills behind my Berkeley apartment. By the beginning of winter, the two ships that made up the expedition had become separated, two landing parties had vanished, and so many sailors on Bering’s flagship had scurvy that they could barely man the sails.

In November, the St. Peter ran aground on an uninhabited island. Many of members of the expedition thought that it was attached to the Siberian mainland and that they would eventually be able to walk to safety, but they were soon proven wrong. A short time after reaching land, the ship broke apart in a storm, and the captain died of scurvy. Steller, who knew how to combat the Vitamin C–deficiency by foraging for herbs, was one of the few crew members still in good health.

Steller quickly realized that the landmass they were on was an island, and one that likely had never been visited by human beings before. Everywhere he went, he was followed by foxes, which showed no fear but eagerly stole any implements or food they could grab in their jaws. One day, walking along the beach searching for firewood, he saw a huge, black shape moving slowly about in the shallows like an overturned boat. Every few minutes a snout would surface for a moment and draw breath with a noise like a horse’s snort. This was the sea cow, seen by the human eyes for the first time in thousands of years. Steller was shocked to realize that this creature was a type of manatee, thousands of miles from its nearest relatives in the tropics. He describes the sea cows as gentle giants, whose only real defense against being harpooned was their incredibly thick hides. He also notes that they seem to have been unusually loyal to one another, which proved to be more of a liability than an asset when the Russians began hunting them for food. They had, in his words, “an uncommon love for one another, which even extended so far that, when one of them was hooked, all the others were intent upon saving him.” When the Russians harpooned one of the sea cows, others would come to its defense, making a circle around their wounded comrade.

The discovery of Morgan’s sphinx moth, which had a tongue just long enough (and no longer), proved Darwin right — some two decades after his death.

It’s one of the great demonstrations of evolution by natural selection. But what naturalists really want is to catch natural selection in the act, as it’s doing the selecting. That’s much harder, and a bit of luck is needed.

Opportunity knocked at the door of biologist Colin Donihue at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a year ago, just after he and his colleagues had returned from Pine Cay and Water Cay, two small islands in the Turks and Caicos archipelago to the north of the Caribbean, where they had been studying the lives and times of its resident anole lizards (Anolis scriptus).

On 8 September last year, Hurricane Irma struck the islands, battering them with sustained winds of up to 265 kilometres per hour. Irma was the first category-5 hurricane on record to strike the region, but more was to come: two weeks later, Hurricane Maria swept across the islands with winds of up to 200 kilometres per hour. Dozens of people in the region died. Reconstruction and rebuilding efforts continue.

Read the paper: Hurricane-induced selection on the morphology of an island lizard

Three weeks after the winds had died down, the researchers were back on Pine Cay and Water Cay to assess the damage, and to see how (or even if) their lizards had survived. Their study, published this week in Nature, is the first to use an immediate before-and-after comparison to assess the impacts of hurricanes on evolutionary selection (C. M. Donihue et al. Nature http://doi.org/csgp; 2018).

Serendipity can go only so far. The researchers hadn’t marked the lizards, so they couldn’t identify and track the fate of individuals. But they found clear trends of natural selection in action. In general, anoles found after the storms had bigger toepads, longer forelimbs and shorter hindlimbs than did lizards collected before the storm.

What have these traits to do with hurricanes? The lizards live in bushes and other low-growing vegetation. Toepads allow them purchase on the branches as they move, and it’s a fair bet that limb proportions also play a part in helping a lizard to keep in contact with a branch, resisting moves by predators, other lizards — or, as it turned out, hurricanes — to knock them off.

The researchers took their idea further with a simple laboratory experiment, in which they allowed lizards to get settled on a perch and then blew them off using a commercial leaf blower, recording the speed at which the lizards were dislodged. (The lizards flew into comfy padding, and were not injured in the experiments.)

This experiment supported the researchers’ hypothesis. In particular, it showed that when lizards are subjected to a stiff breeze, they hang on tightly with their forelimbs and let their hindlimbs hang loose. Longer hindlimbs, then, offer more purchase to the winds, explaining why lizards found after the storms tended to have shorter hindlimbs, but longer forelimbs.

These bigger toepads, shorter hindlimbs and longer forelimbs did not evolve as a direct response to the hurricanes, but they show how such evolution occurs. Natural selection interfered with the way in which these traits were spread across the population. Specifically, those lizards unable to hang on when the storms blew up — those with smaller toepads, longer hindlimbs and shorter forelimbs — were (presumably) blown away and perished. Those lizards better able to hang on tightly would have survived to weather another day. In technical terms, the mean values of the crucial traits measured before the storms had shifted. These changes are phenotypic — merely observable characteristics. They say nothing about the genetic assimilation of such changes, which will presumably happen when the surviving lizards breed and new lizards are recruited to the population. Such changes are unlikely to be the last, given the expected increases in extreme weather that the future will bring.",mainstream,M0ad5c,big.foot
29,351,"Why on earth would the US government conspire to cover up any kind of archaeological findings? Of what possible threat could honest, scientific discovery pose to national security or the common good?

Yet, this is exactly what happened when American diggers found skeletal remains of oversize humans: giants.

Disclose.tv reported earlier this year on a story that was ridiculed and debunked as soon as it was made public some decades ago: that the Smithsonian Institution destroyed thousands of giant human skeletons.

The World News Daily Report was the first publication to claim that the US cover-up of giant human remains began in the early 1900s. (It is entirely possible that earlier cases will be found, in the future.)

This leading scientific organization responded to allegations of their deceitful actions by filing a lawsuit to protect their sterling reputation. The Event Chronicle fills in the details:

“A US Supreme Court ruling has forced the Smithsonian institution to release classified papers dating from the early 1900’s that proves the organization was involved in a major historical cover-up of evidence showing giants human remains in the tens of thousands had been uncovered all across America and were ordered to be destroyed by high-level administrators to protect the mainstream chronology of human evolution at the time.

“The allegations stemming from the American Institution of Alternative Archeology (AIAA) that the Smithsonian Institution had destroyed thousands of giant human remains during the early 1900’s was not taken lightly by the Smithsonian who responded by suing the organization for defamation and trying to damage the reputation of the 168-year old institution.

“…Smithsonian whistle blowers admitted to the existence of documents that allegedly proved the destruction of tens of thousands of human skeletons reaching between 6 feet and 12 feet in height, a reality mainstream archeology can not admit to for different reasons, claims AIAA spokesman, James Churward.”

Honestly, covering up the existence of giants on earth, in order to preserve a theory that explains how humans came to inhabit North America, makes very little sense: who stands to gain, and who stands to lose?

Could it be that the US leadership decided that the citizenry would freak out from the news of giants who lived in the distant past?

The Bible (Genesis 6:4) states very matter-of-factly: “There were giants in the Earth in those days” – as if contemporary readers knew this to be true, undoubtedly from the passage of oral tradition. Great warriors like Goliath (bested by David and his sling) were described, and the locations of giants’ kingdoms were disclosed.

Many other civilizations around the world have “myths” about giants, as listed in this fascinating article by an unnamed author. American immigrants brought their cultural heritages with them.

But a folk tale is a far cry from scientific rigor. So why the modern cover-up of actual physical evidence that supports those “children’s stories?”

One mundane explanation would be that influential (as in, wealthy), mainstream archaeologists wanted to maintain their scientific supremacy, and persuaded the federal government to help perpetuate the lie that giants never existed anywhere in the world, much less in the continental US. After all, schools taught that the earliest American inhabitants trekked over a Bering Strait land bridge – over the north pole, nearly – into modern-day Alaska a mere 15,000 years ago. Perhaps the scientific community “needed to be right?”

Fortunately for Us the People, with the age of the internet and instant, global communication the Truth is becoming harder and harder to hide.

In this century, the oldest human fossils – not gigantic, by the way – have been found in northern Africa (Jebel Irhoud, Morocco). These remains date to around 315,000 years old, as The Atlantic Daily, Nature, and other scientific publications have reported!

Archaeological discoveries keep pushing the date of human (homo sapiens sapiens, that is) origin further and further back in time.

These dates happen to jive with ancient source texts that discuss human origin, notably the Sumerian clay tablets translated by Zecharia Sitchin. This Azerbaijani-born American researcher and author upset the anthropological world with his revelation that humans had been bred by an off-world race called the Annunaki – “alien overlords” (in this case, the term actually does fit) – to serve them, especially to mine gold in the hot African sun.

Just as the Bible later described, the Annunaki – or “fallen angels” – bred with human women and birthed…a race of giants called the Nephilim. The giants had big appetites, and devoured all the crops and livestock before turning to humans as their next food source. At this point, the Annunaki admitted that the Nephilim had gotten out of hand, and flooded the earth as a global Mulligan (“do-over”) – kind of like shaking an Etch-a-Sketch upside down in order to “clean the slate.”

Now, this is where the conspiracy about giants gets interesting. Sitchin’s work continues to be refuted by “experts,” even as more archaeological evidence of beings with elongated skulls, giants and ancient African gold mines inhabited by early humans continues to pile up.

Is the New World Order actually threatened by a citizenry that is fully aware of our alien-hybridized human origin?

If people, collectively, understood that we were created to serve ETs (termed “gods” in ancient texts), how would that change our society and others around the world?

Ignoring the Illuminati agenda, alternative news sources continue to report similar “gigantic” findings from around the world. To cite just a couple: “Nephilim Bones and Giant Human Skeletons in Greece” and “Skeletons of 5,000-year-old Chinese ‘giants’ discovered by archaeologists.”

Regardless of the “why” behind yet another government discovery/lie/cover-up, it is clear that, in those days, yeah – there really were giants.",conspiracy,C03510,big.foot; illuminati

31,478,"The start of the northern meteorological winter on December 1 will bring with it short days of darkness, blistering cold and frigid blizzards. For many people, this is the dreariest time of the year. But for a small niche of water-happy athletes, winter is a time to play, as ferocious storms send rippling rings of energy outward through the ocean. By the time they reach distant shores, these swells have matured into clean, polished waves that barrel in with a cold and ceaseless military rhythm; they touch bottom, slow, build and, finally, collapse in spectacular curls and thundering white water. These are the things of dreams for surfers, many of whom travel the planet, pursuing giant breakers. And surfers aren’t the only ones with their eyes on the water—for surfing has become a popular spectator sport. At many famed breaks, bluffs on the shore provide fans with thrilling views of the action. The waves alone are awesome—so powerful they may seem to shake the earth. But when a tiny human figure on a board as flimsy as a matchstick appears on the face of that incoming giant, zigzagging forward as the wave curls overhead and threatens to crush him, spines tingle, hands come together in prayer, and jaws drop. Whether you like the water or not, big-wave surfing is one of the most thrilling shows on the planet.

The birth of big-wave surfing was an incremental process that began in the 1930s and ’40s in Hawaii, especially along the north-facing shores of the islands. Here, 15-foot waves were once considered giants, and anything much bigger just eye candy. But wave at a time, surfers stoked up their courage and ambition. They surfed on bigger days, used lighter and lighter boards that allowed swifter paddling and hunted for breaks that consistently produced monsters. One by one, big-wave spots were cataloged, named and ranked, and wave at a time, records were set. In November 1957, big-wave pioneer Greg Noll rode an estimated 25-footer in Waimea Bay, Oahu. In 1969, Noll surfed what was probably a 30-plus-footer, but no verified photos exist of the wave, and thus no means of determining its height. Fast-forwarding a few decades, Mike Parsons caught a 66-foot breaker in 2001 at Cortes Bank, 115 miles off San Diego, where a seamount rises to within three feet of the surface. In 2008, Parsons was back at the same place and caught a 77-footer. But Garrett McNamara outdid Parsons and set the current record in November 2011, when he rode a 78-foot wave off the coast of Portugal, at the town of Nazare.

But these later records may not have been possible without the assistance of jet skis, which have become a common and controversial element in the pursuit of giant waves. The vehicles first began appearing in the surf during big-wave events in the early 1990s, and for all their noise and stench, their appeal was undeniable: Jet skis made it possible to access waves 40 feet and bigger, and whose scale had previously been too grand for most unassisted surfers to reach by paddling. Though tow-in surfing has given a boost to the record books, it has also heightened the danger of surfing, and many surfers have died in big waves they might never have attempted without jet-ski assistance. Not surprisingly, many surfers have rejected tow-in surfing as an affront to the purity of their relationship with waves—and they still manage to catch monsters. In March 2011, Shane Dorian rode a 57-foot breaker at the famed Jaws break in Maui, unassisted by a belching two-stroke engine. But many big-wave riders fully endorse tow-in surfing as a natural evolution of the sport. Surfing supertstar Laird Hamilton has even blown off purists who continue to paddle after big waves without jet skis as “moving backward.” Anyway, in a sport that relies heavily on satellite imagery, Internet swell forecasts and red-eye flights to Honolulu, are we really complaining about a little high-tech assistance?

For those wishing merely to watch big waves and the competitors that gather to ride them, all that is needed is a picnic blanket and binoculars—and perhaps some help from this swell forecast website. Following are some superb sites to watch surfers catch the biggest breakers in the world this winter.

Waimea Bay, North Shore of Oahu. Big-wave surfing was born here, largely fueled by the fearless vision of Greg Noll in the 1950s. The definition of “big” for extreme surfers has grown since the early days, yet Waimea still holds its own. Fifty-foot waves can occur here—events that chase all but the best wave riders from the water. When conditions allow, elite surfers participate in the recurring Quicksilver Eddie Aikau Invitational. Spectators teem on the shore during big-swell periods, and while surfers may fight for their ride, you may have to fight for your view. Get there early.

Jaws, North Shore of Maui. Also known as Peahi, Jaws produces some of the most feared and attractive waves on earth. The break—where 50-footers and bigger appear almost every year—is almost strictly a tow-in site, but rebel paddle-by-hand surfers do business here, too. Twenty-one pros have been invited to convene at Jaws this winter for a paddle-in competition sometime between December 7 and March 15. Spectators are afforded a great view of the action on a high nearby bluff. But go early, as hundreds will be in line for the best viewing points. Also, bring binoculars, as the breakers crash almost a mile offshore.

Mavericks, Half Moon Bay, California. Mavericks gained its reputation in the 1980s and ’90s, during the revival of big-wave surfing, which lost some popularity in the 1970s. Named for a German Shepherd named Maverick who took a surgy swim here in 1961, the site (which gained an “s” but never an official apostrophe) generates some of the biggest surfable waves in the world. Today, surfing competitions, like the Mavericks Big Wave Contest and the Mavericks Invitational, are held each year. The waves of Mavericks crash on a vicious reef, making them predictable (sandy bottoms will shift and change the wave form) but nonetheless hazardous. One of the best surfers of his time, Mark Foo died here in 1994 when his ankle leash is believed to have snagged on the bottom. Later, the waves claimed the life of Hawaiian surfing star Sion Milosky. A high bluff above the beach offers a view of the action. As at Jaws, bring binoculars.

Ghost Trees, Monterey Peninsula, California. This break hits peak form under the same swell conditions that get things roaring at Mavericks, just a three-hour drive north. Ghost Trees is a relatively new attraction for big-wave riders. Veteran surfer Don Curry says he first saw it surfed in 1974. Decades would pass before it became famous, and before it killed pro surfer (and a pioneer of nearby Mavericks) Peter Davi in 2007. For surfing spectators, there are few places quite like Ghost Trees. The waves, which can hit 50 feet and more, break just a football field’s length from shore.

Mullaghmore Head, Ireland. Far from the classic Pacific shores of big-wave legend and history, Mullaghmore Head comes alive during winter storms in the North Atlantic. The location produces waves big enough that surfing here has become primarily a jet ski-assisted game. In fact, the event period for the Billabong Tow-In Session at Mullaghmore began on November 1 and will run through February 2013. Just how big is Mullaghmore Head? On March 8, 2012, the waves here reached 50 feet, as determined by satellite measurements. A grassy headland provides an elevated platform from which to see the show. Bundle up if you go, and expect cold, blustery conditions.

Teahupoo, Tahiti. This coveted break blooms with big swells from the Southern Ocean—usually during the southern winter. Teahupoo is famed for its classic tube breakers.

Shipsterns Bluff, Tasmania. Watch for this point’s giants to break from June through September.

Punta de Lobos, Chile. Channeling the energy of the Southern Ocean into huge but glassy curlers, Punta de Lobos breaks at its best in March and April.

Todos Santos Island, Baja California, Mexico. Todos Santos Island features several well-known breaks, but “Killers” is the biggest and baddest. The surf usually peaks in the northern winter.

There is another sort of wave that thrills tourists and spectators: the tidal bore. These moon-induced phenomena occur with regularity at particular locations around the world. The most spectacular to see include the tidal bores of Hangzhou Bay, China, and Araguari, Brazil—each of which has become a popular surfing event.",mainstream,M0c897,big.foot
32,1319,"What is a man like Joe doing with Bigfoot? Joe is a mexicano who knew some of the same Spanish folktales that Juan B. Rael had collected many years earlier in the area around Antonito, Colorado. I found Joe in his store of “collectables” on Main Street. His store was a little community center where people from town dropped in to talk about the news of the day. Joe is a lot like his father, Anastacio, whose boot‐making shop had also become a little community center. Joe remembers sheepherders complaining to his father that the police had stolen their money. The sheepherders came to town to collect their pay and go on a bender. They deposited most of their money with the cops who pocketed it for themselves and denied having received it. Anastacio wasn't afraid of confronting the cops. Joe's dad was a valorista , or brave man of his word who defended the weak against the strong.

Joe told me the folktales he had learned from his parents and then nudged me in a different direction. He took me to his backyard shed, pulled out a dusty box of manuscripts he had written in long hand and asked me to read them. Joe liked to read western novels by Louis L'amour and emulated that author's style. One of the manuscripts was a story about Bigfoot. I knew about his interest in the creature because he had shown us a video he and his son had taken of large footprints with an unusually long gait in the snow south of town. Joe did not see the creature that made them, and so he sought out others who had. Several had caught fleeting glimpses of something crossing Highway 285 in the cut just across the New Mexico border. A woodcutter said he found the cave where Bigfoot lives. A rancher said he came face to face with the creature in the Hansen Creek area in the San Juan Wilderness west of town. That same rancher added that many Bigfoot live in the llano between two dormant volcanoes, Mt. San Antonio south of town and Ute Mountain to the east.

At first I didn't understand why a man like Joe, who spent his life fighting for his raza would care so much about proving the existence of Bigfoot. Didn't the creature come from mass media, and weren't most enthusiasts white working class men on the wrong side of the Civil Rights struggle? Joe has stood up for the underdog his entire life. He worked as a business agent for the union presenting grievances to the Miner brothers who managed the Perlite plant south of town. Joe said: “They had my raza down in the lower paying jobs sweeping and doing the cleaning and all the hard labor. Bud Miner hated to see me coming. He told me: ‘I'm tired of you Mexicans coming over here and trying to tell us what to do.’”

There is a lot of chicanery connected with this North American wildman, and so I shied away from the subject at first. Every time we returned to Antonito, Joe told me he had found another person who had seen footprints or caught a fleeting glimpse of the creature. An Anglo showed some photographs of footprints he had taken with his cell phone camera. We held two Bigfoot parties in our Antonito home with people whose testimonies Joe considered believable. We followed them up with interviews in their homes. Joe will talk to anyone who has seen Bigfoot. It doesn't matter to him if they are Anglos or mexicanos. He knows from watching television that Bigfoot researchers are mainly Anglos.

Joe cobbled together what he learned from the witnesses to write his story, which he says is “pure fiction.” The central protagonist, Marc Gomez, is Joe's idea of a mexicano everyman who has lost touch with his ancestors. Marc is 39, just divorced from his wife, retired after 20 years in the army, and is living in Los Angeles. He loves to read western paperback novels about New Mexico and is ready for a change. He packs up his Air Stream trailer, hitches it to his Bronco, and heads toward the Land of Enchantment. Marc, like Joe himself, sets out on a quest to find Bigfoot after he dreamt of giant faceless creatures running after him on a forsaken prairie. He heads up Highway 285 and overhears, on his CB radio, a conversation between truckers one of whom says: “Some animal came out of the bar pit. I'm sure I hit it with my back wheels. Looked like a bear or something big.” Marc follows leads to an old mexicano sheepherder who lives in Velarde, New Mexico, who ran into the creature on the llano near Ute Mountain. The sheepherder has a daughter, Cristina, and she becomes Marc's lover and companion, and together they enter Bigfoot's world in the volcanic caverns under the llano. Marc and Cristina discover the creature's world is like that of humans above the llano. The strong prey on the weak in both places. Marc and Cristina show they are both valoristas by defending the weaker Bigfoot from the stronger ones who attempt to enslave them.

Each witness we interviewed had a particular take on the creature. They said he is peaceful, adapted, intelligent looking, strong, massive but graceful, and proud. Some say he is a loner, and others say he lives in families. Those with greater knowledge of the environment speak with more authority. The mexicanos I know tell and write stories about Bigfoot to claim their rightful place on a llano they share with others.",mainstream,M1306a,big.foot
0,903,"A carbon tax is paid by businesses and industries that produce carbon dioxide through their operations. The tax is designed to reduce the output of greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide, a colorless and odorless incombustible gas, into the atmosphere. The tax is imposed with the goal of environmental protection.

A tax designed to mitigate or remove the negative externalities of carbon emission, a carbon tax is a type of Pigovian tax. Carbon is found in every kind of hydrocarbon fuel (including coal, petroleum, and natural gas) and is released as the harmful toxin carbon dioxide (CO ) when this kind of fuel is burned. CO is the compound primarily responsible for the ""greenhouse"" effect of trapping heat within the Earth's atmosphere, and is, therefore, one of the primary causes of global warming.

A carbon tax is also referred to as a form of carbon pricing on greenhouse gas emissions where a fixed price is set by the government for carbon emissions in certain sectors. The price is passed through from businesses to consumers. By increasing the cost of greenhouse emissions, governments hope to curb consumption, reduce the demand for fossil fuels, and push more companies toward creating environmentally-friendly substitutes. A carbon tax is a way for a state to exert some control over carbon emissions without resorting to the levers of a command economy, by which the state could control the means of production and manually halt carbon emissions.

Any carbon found in manufactured products like plastics that is not burned is not taxed. The same applies to any CO that is permanently isolated from production and is not released into the atmosphere. But the tax is paid during the upstream process, or when the fuel or gas is extracted from the Earth. Producers can then pass on the tax to the market by as much as they can. This, in turn, gives consumers a chance to reduce their own carbon footprints.

Carbon taxes have been implemented in a number of countries around the world. They take several different forms, but most amount to a straightforward rate of taxation per ton of hydrocarbon fuel used. The first country to implement a carbon tax was Finland, in 1990. That levy currently stands at $24.39 dollars per ton of carbon. The Finns were quickly followed by other Nordic countries — Sweden and Norway both implemented their own carbon taxes in 1991. Starting at a rate of $51 per ton of CO used in gasoline (the tax would later decrease considerably), the Norwegian tax is among the most stringent in the world.

Most forms of carbon taxation have been deployed successfully, but Australia's failed attempt from 2012-2014 stands in stark contrast. The minority Green party was able to broker the carbon tax during a period of political stagnation in 2011, but the tax never garnered the support of either of the main parties in Australia, the left-leaning Labor Party (which reluctantly agreed to the tax to form a government with the Greens) and the center-right Liberals, whose leader Tony Abbott spearheaded the 2014 repeal. Like most economic initiatives to combat climate change, carbon taxes remain highly controversial.",mainstream,M07e79,climate.change

The seven candidates all said they would be willing to relocate entire cities or individuals within cities who are threatened with climate-related disasters, in California due to fires or to floods in the Midwest.

The question hit home for debate viewers in this state, given the deadly wildfires of recent years, including the Camp fire that decimated the town of Paradise and killed 86 people in 2018.

Agreeing with the relocation idea, New York entrepreneur Andrew Yang said that “part of the plan is literally called move people to higher ground.”

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said her interest in helping people dealing with “unprecedented flooding” was personal. “It’s not flyover country to me. I live there,” she said.

The relocation discussion expanded to one about the need for the entire country to take the lead in addressing the issue and whether the next president would support alternative energy plans to wean the nation off fossil fuels, ones that include nuclear power.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren repeated her opposition to nuclear power but said the nation has to aggressively explore other clean-energy sources.

Yang said that as president, he’d put all options on the table, including nuclear energy use, to reduce the nation’s reliance on oil as a way to clean the air.

California billionaire Tom Steyer said he supports increasing the use of nuclear energy but also investing in wind, solar and battery power. He said addressing climate change would represent “the greatest opportunity to rebuild this country.”

3,538,"PRINCE HARRY met a Russian billionaire linked to his and Meghan's £11million Canada hideaway at a celebrity Google climate change retreat, it is reported.

The Duke of Sussex is said to have enjoyed a 'substantive chat' with businessman Yuri Milner at the three-day Google Camp gathering in Sicily last summer.

Mr Milner hosted a superyacht cocktail party for A-listers, who included Leonardo Di Caprio, Tom Cruise, Orlando Bloom and Harry Styles, The Daily Mail reports.

It was reported at the time that Prince Harry gave a barefoot speech at the Google climate retreat but celebs were criticised for using gas-guzzling private jets and superyachts to get there.

Harry and Meghan are thought to have planned their bombshell retreat from frontline royal life at the stunning Mille Fleurs home on Vancouver Island.

But the royal couple have been at the heart of a secrecy row over who lent them the luxury mansion.

Harry and Meghan refused to say if they paid for their six-week stay or confirm who the property belongs to.

Moscow-born Mr Milner also rented Mille Fleurs five years ago, but denies he now owns the stunning pad.

But neighbours claim the holiday home is owned by a Russian billionaire.

Mr Milner's pal Canadian music producer David Foster also has a home on Vancouver Island.

The Sun previously revealed Harry and Meghan asked neighbours to sign non-disclosure agreements before moving in for Christmas with baby Archie.

The Mille Fleurs home near Victoria, British Columbia, would have cost more than £100,000 to rent.

The idyllic bolthole has stunning views and boasts eight bedrooms and two private beaches.

One local, who did not wish to be named, told The Sun: “I was very surprised to hear they were staying there because it’s always been a mystery about who actually owns it.

""It doesn’t seem the sort of place a royal couple would go.”

The mystery over the property’s ownership is likely to raise concerns over the couple’s acquaintances as they seek “financial independence”.

An estate agent who helped sell it in 2014 said the new owner included a non-disclosure agreement as part of the deal.

He said the buyer was neither Canadian nor American.

The complex purchasing method can help people hide their involvement.

4,192,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change asked scientists to come up with a figure of how temperature trends have risen over the last 10,000 years for the next annual report; however this task has proven quite difficult.

Zhengyu Liu, professor of atmospheric and ocean sciences at the University of Wisconsin, explains:

“Data from observation suggests that the Earth is cooling while the physical data suggests the complete opposite.”

Liu has been working with professors from many other academias to understand the obvious cooling of the planet:

The issue has been termed the Holocene Temperature Conundrum (HTC) which is explained:

“A recent temperature reconstruction of global annual temperature shows Early Holocene warmth followed by a cooling trend through the Middle to Late Holocene [Marcott SA, et al., 2013, Science 339(6124):1198–1201]. “This global cooling is puzzling because it is opposite from the expected and simulated global warming trend due to the retreating ice sheets and rising atmospheric greenhouse gases. “Our critical reexamination of this contradiction between the reconstructed cooling and the simulated warming points to potentially significant biases in both the seasonality of the proxy reconstruction and the climate sensitivity of current climate models.”

“Over the last 10,000 years, Liu says, we know atmospheric carbon dioxide rose by 20 parts per million before the 20th century, and the massive ice sheet of the Last Glacial Maximum has been retreating. “These physical changes suggest that, globally, the annual mean global temperature should have continued to warm, even as regions of the world experienced cooling, such as during the Little Ice Age in Europe between the 16th and 19th centuries.”

The myth perpetuated by alarmist scientists is that there is a 97% consensus that man-made climate change is real and that the Earth is heating up.

However, John Cook, climate scientist for the UQ Global Change Institute (GCI), released data from the University of Queensland (UQ) that shows “that the number of papers rejecting the consensus on [anthropogenic global warming] is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.”

Alastair McEwan, acting pro-vice-chancellor of UQ defended the college’s claim that there is a scientific consensus, independently of Cook’s findings:

To discredit Cook, a study was released in 2013 by climatologists that claimed Cook “misrepresented the views of most consensus scientists.”

This shows that the consensus that humans are the sole cause of climate change is actually only 0.3%. David Legates, geology professor for the University of Delaware commented:",conspiracy,C007bc,climate.change
5,893,"Tonsillitis (pronounced: tahn-suh-LYE-tus) is an infection of the tonsils caused by viruses or some types of bacteria.

Tonsils are lumps of tissue on both sides of the back of the throat that help the immune system protect the body from infections. But sometimes infections are too much for the tonsils to handle, and these fighters of infection become infected themselves.

Infected tonsils get swollen and red, and have a yellow or white coating. A person with tonsillitis may have a sore throat, fever, swollen glands in the neck, and trouble swallowing.

What Are the Signs & Symptoms of Tonsillitis?

Inflamed tonsils look red and swollen, and may be covered with a yellow or whitish coating or spots. Someone with tonsillitis may have:
• a sore throat, which can be mild to severe
• white spots or pus on the tonsils

If you have symptoms of tonsillitis, call your doctor.

Tonsillitis is usually caused by a

Bacteria also can cause it, most commonly group A streptococcus (strep throat). Rarely, tonsillitis can be caused by something other than an infection.

Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and examine your throat and neck. Your doctor may use a soft cotton swab to gently collect a sample from your tonsils and the back of your throat for testing.

It's important for your doctor to know if

are causing the infection. If you have strep throat, you'll need treatment withto kill the bacteria. This will help you feel better and prevent other problems that can come from untreated strep throat.

If your doctor prescribes antibiotics, be sure to follow the directions carefully. Finish taking all the medicine even if your symptoms go away and you feel better, or the infection could come back.

If a strep test comes back negative, it's probably a virus causing the tonsillitis and antibiotics won't help. Just like with a cold (also caused by a virus), you'll have to take it easy for several days and let the virus run its course.

Rarely, if someone gets tonsillitis a lot, the doctor or an otolaryngologist (pronounced: oh-toe-lar-un-GA-luh-jist, a doctor who specializes in ear, nose, and throat problems) may recommend a tonsillectomy (pronounced: tahn-suh-LEK-tuh-mee). This is a surgery to remove the tonsils. Tonsillectomy used to be a common procedure, but now experts recommend watching and waiting because large tonsils often shrink on their own over time.

How Can I Feel Better?

Get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids. You can take acetaminophen or ibuprofen to relieve any pain or discomfort. (Don't take aspirin or other products that contain aspirin, though, because these may put you at risk of developing Reye syndrome, an illness that can have serious complications.)

Avoid smoking or anything that will irritate your throat. It's best to drink lots of liquids. You may prefer softer foods, like applesauce, flavored gelatin, or ice cream. If you don't feel like eating, try drinking liquids that contain calories, such as fruit juices, milkshakes, and soups and broths.

If you're on antibiotics, it's usually OK to return to school 24 hours after you start taking them if your fever is gone and you feel better. If you're still feeling weak, tired, or achy, it may be best to stay home for another day or two.

Tonsillitis is contagious. This means you can get it from someone else who has it. Sneezing and coughing can pass the tonsillitis-causing virus or bacteria from one person to the next.

To protect yourself from catching tonsillitis or to prevent passing it to somebody else:
• Wash your hands well and often.
• If someone in your household or a friend has tonsillitis, don't use that person's cups, glasses, silverware, toothbrush, or other utensils. And if you have tonsillitis, keep your stuff separate and don't share it with anyone.
• Don't kiss anyone until you're completely over the tonsillitis.
• Get a new toothbrush after you feel better and are no longer contagious.

When Should I Call the Doctor?

Call your doctor right away if your condition gets worse; for example, if you have a hard time breathing or swallowing. Also talk to your doctor if your fever comes back or if you're not feeling better in a couple of days.",mainstream,M0d3c7,climate.change
6,427,"Can the Weather Affect My Child's Asthma?

Yes. Weather conditions can bring on asthma symptoms. Some kids' asthma symptoms get worse at certain times of the year. For others, a severe storm or sudden weather change can trigger a flare-up.

Cold, dry air is a common asthma trigger and can cause bad flare-ups. That's especially true for people who play winter sports and have exercise-induced asthma.

Hot, humid air also can be a problem. In some places, heat and sunlight combine with pollutants to create ground-level ozone. This kind of ozone can be a strong asthma trigger.

Wet weather and windy weather can cause problems too. Wet weather encourages mold growth, and wind can blow mold and pollen through the air.

If you think weather plays a role in your child's asthma, keep a diary of asthma symptoms and possible triggers and discuss them with your doctor. If pollen, mold, or other allergens make asthma symptoms worse, ask about allergy testing.

How Can We Avoid Weather Triggers?

Once you know what kind of weather triggers asthma symptoms, try these tips to protect your child:
• Watch the forecast for pollen and mold counts plus other conditions (extreme cold or heat) that might affect your child's asthma.
• Make sure your child wears a scarf over the mouth and nose when outside in very cold weather.
• Keep windows closed at night to keep pollen and molds out. If it's hot, use air conditioning, which cleans, cools, and dries the air.
• Keep your child indoors early in the morning (before 10 a.m.) when pollen is at its highest.
• Your child shouldn't mow the lawn or rake leaves, and should be kept away from freshly cut grass and leaf piles.
• Dry clothes in the dryer (hanging clothes or sheets to dry can allow mold or pollen to collect on them).
• Make sure your child always has quick-relief medicine (also called rescue or fast-acting medicine) on hand.

7,591,"Coronavirus won't be the last outbreak. Climate change, waning habitat will drive disease

Researchers aren't clear yet about how the novel coronavirus began infecting people, but say it seems to have originated in bats, making it the latest in a string of emerging human disease that spread from animals.

Disease and wildlife experts say they expect to see a rise in diseases transmitted among animals, plants and humans, and in particular, more frequent outbreaks in humans of diseases that come from animals. Such ""zoonotic"" diseases already make up the majority of new infections in humans.

But animals aren't to blame for the increase in new outbreaks, according to Arizona State University virologist Arvind Varsani. Humans are.

Varsani researches the emergence of diseases around the globe and he said two major factors likely to impact the dynamics of virus spread are climate change and changes in land use due to urbanization or agriculture.

Both factors put animals under strain, forcing them to compete for resources in shrinking habitats and making them opportune hosts for zoonotic diseases, which more easily infect stressed animals. Shrinking suitable habitat amid urbanization and the rapid expansion of agriculture also cluster animals closer together with humans and domestic animals. That allows the viruses to jump from one host to the next.

“You stress these animals and that means you’re creating an environment for viruses to succeed, where in most cases the viruses would’ve been put to check,"" he said. ""And with that, everyone is in very, very close proximity to each other, so what you’ve got is one event — and you only need one event to take off — and the next thing you know, it's spilling over.”

And sometimes, the viruses spill over into humans.

According to a 2016 report from the United Nations Environment Programme, around 60 percent of all infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic, as well as 75 percent of all emerging infectious diseases. Researchers also detected an increase in the rate of new, emerging infectious diseases, according to the report.

In the case of the novel coronavirus, the source is believed to be a market in Wuhan, China, that sold both dead and live animals. Arizona Game and Fish wildlife veterinarian Anne Justice-Allen said that veterinarians and disease experts strongly recommend against having markets like these, which can be densely packed, difficult to keep clean, and pose a higher risk of viruses jumping from animals into humans.

She said the current COVID-19 outbreak is an example of how human actions to mix together animals that weren't normally together can cause diseases to jump into new hosts.

""The more we increase the interaction between people and animals, especially wildlife and especially livestock as well, or animals that are raised for food, the more likely we are to see that kind of situation crop up,"" she said.

The COVID-19 outbreak is an example of the risk zoonotic diseases pose. Other well-known examples of zoonotic diseases that impact humans are West Nile Virus, HIV, Ebola, Zika, bird flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, Rift Valley fever, and sudden acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. On average, one new infectious disease emerges in humans every four months, according to the UNEP report, but not all are this severe.

“While it is very uncommon for diseases in animals to suddenly jump and become so transmissible between people as this one did, the more we do that sort of thing, mixing animals together ... then the more likely that disease is going to be able to jump into people and become transmissible between people,"" Justice-Allen said.

With climate change effects such as drought, increasing temperatures and wildfires, Justice-Allen said animals will be forced to move to new areas. That would lead to the same type of crowding and mixing seen in live animal markets and possibly expose animals to new diseases.

FIGHTING CORONAVIRUS: Using robots to speed up testing, ASU hopes to open drive-thru coronavirus testing

Warming global temperatures are increasing the habitat ranges of some insects that transmit diseases from one organism to another, such as mosquitoes or ticks. Warming is also lengthening the season in which these insects can survive in some areas, leading to a boom in their population. In certain areas, these insects, also known as disease vectors, are now able to survive year-round where they weren't able to before.

The increased range and abundance of vectors could lead to more widespread cases of mosquito- and tick-borne diseases such as malaria, West Nile Virus, dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika, and Lyme disease, according to Heidi Brown, an ASU researcher who studies vector-borne diseases.

Brown is one of the researchers who works with the Arizona Department of Health Services on a Building Resilience Against Climate Effects plan, which investigates the impacts of climate change on human health, projects future scenarios and suggests solutions to mitigate those effects. Arizona is one of 16 state grant recipients creating a BRACE plan as part of the CDC's Climate-Ready States and Cities Initiative.

""We have to be prepared for the known, which is increases in the stuff that we're already seeing, but we also have to be prepared for the unknown, which is novel introductions,"" she said.

In Arizona, known diseases such as West Nile Virus are likely to become a bigger concern, and may spread into new areas of the state outside of Maricopa County, Brown said.

""Flagstaff doesn't typically think about or worry too much about West Nile Virus, and we don't usually have a lot of cases up there, but there's evidence that suggests that we might need to start making sure that we're watching for it,"" she said.

Arizona is also worried about other mosquito-born diseases like chikungunya and dengue fever, which aren't currently part of Arizona's ecosystem but could become permanently established in the future.

Factors like drought can also cause vectors to cluster around water sources alongside of animals, leading to further mixing and further possibilities for new diseases spread in vectors.

Another bridge between humans and animal diseases is domestic animals, according to Bernard Bett, a scientist at International Livestock Research Institute.

Around the world, Bett said agriculture is increasingly encroaching on wild lands, bringing humans and domestic animals closer to wild ones and disturbing the natural ecosystem. But domestic animals have been bred in such a way that they lack the genetic diversity needed for disease resilience and can then pass the infection on to humans.

One example is the bird flu, which moved from wild birds into domestic poultry before being passed to humans.

Demand for milk and meat ""driven mainly by fast-growing populations of urban consumers in developing countries,"" is projected to double by 2050, according to the UNEP report, meaning that the problem is likely to get worse as agricultural demand expands.

Urbanization also can encroach on wild lands, Varsani said, and that means humans are coming into increased contact with animals — creating another potential avenue for disease transmission.

Increased zoonotic disease spread could also have devastating effects on animals, especially those already at risk from other climate change effects.

“We have a number of endangered species here in Arizona which are kind of on the edge when it comes to being able to respond to new stressors,"" Justice-Allen said.

One is the Mount Graham red squirrel, whose habitat was severely damaged by a wildfire in 2017. While the population seems to be recovering, Justice-Allen said, ""another stressor might tip them over the edge.""

Other populations on the brink include the California condor, the black-footed ferret, and Arizona's indigenous snakes and amphibians such as frogs. Some are already being challenged by disease.

Black-footed ferrets feed on prairie dogs, but the plague, spread by fleas, can wipe out entire colonies of prairie dogs, decimating the ferrets' food supply. This disease isn't native to North America, currently has a small incident rate in humans and is curable in most cases. But cases of plague could surge in coming years due to climate change, according to Justice-Allen.

""The dynamics of plague outbreaks is changing, or will change,"" she said. ""This spring is setting us up for a pretty significant plague outbreak.""

Arizona's frogs and other amphibians are battling a fungal disease called chytridiomycosis, which was first seen in Africa and interferes with the ability of their skin to absorb moisture.

These diseases, along with mosquito- and tick-borne diseases, are just a few known diseases that Arizona experts are monitoring. But there's always the possibility for unknowns — for new diseases to show up unexpectedly — especially in tight living conditions.

In more clustered spaces, Varsani said there's a greater chance for an animal to become infected with two different diseases at the same time, opening the possibility for the birth of chimeras, or mash-ups, of two different, related viruses.

If two viruses are infecting the same cell, when those viruses replicate, they can combine into a new hybrid virus that could jump into new animals that were previously unaffected.

""You mix components and what you’re then doing is you’re allowing for these viral genomes to evolve very rapidly and adapt to a new host,"" he said.

Varsani also works to find and study unknown viruses in remote areas, such as the polar regions. He has traveled to Antarctica nearly every year since he first visited about seven years ago, and said viruses he studies there may have been around for a while, but were only discovered recently.

One example is a circovirus that has only recently been noticed in penguins and that causes lethal feather loss.

Viruses in the polar regions are just as abundant as they are in other parts of the world, he said, and since the polar regions are expected to see some of the most dramatic changes due to climate change, these regions and their viruses are crucial to understand for the future.

As seen with the COVID-19 outbreak, vaccines for new diseases take time to develop, as do tests to screen for them.

Arizona and other states have come up with plans to deal with increased outbreaks and have vector-control measures in place, but Brown acknowledged that it can be hard to prepare for new emerging diseases.

""It's a long process to be able to come up with tests and identify new pathogens, especially when they're not the ones you're used to looking for.”

The Arizona Game and Fish Department monitors for new disease emergences by surveilling animal populations and investigating animal deaths to ensure that the cause of death wasn't an unknown disease, according to Justice-Allen.

Bett said health care officials can take other measures to ensure that there is a structured, strong health system in place with contingency plans for disease outbreaks and centers where patients can be isolated or receive supportive treatment.

“I wonder to what extent the U.S. anticipated this spread. If you have good anticipation, that’s a good first line of defense,"" Bett said.

Even with further study of climate effects on disease, there can be unpredicted challenges in trying to anticipate and address new diseases, said Ben Beard, the deputy director of the CDC’s Division of Vector-Borne Diseases in Fort Collins, Colorado.

""While long term trends in climate change can be modeled, specific weather events or disasters such as hurricanes, floods, or fires are very difficult to predict and may have a big impact on disease outbreaks,"" he wrote in an email to The Republic.

To prepare and respond to future outbreaks, he said, a strong public health framework that prioritizes public health surveillance, state and local preparedness, and long-term research would be necessary.

In addition to being more conscious of how people affect the environment and existing ecosystems, Varsani said identifying and understanding the viruses present in the world currently can help society better prepare to control them. This is no small feat, considering that viruses are among the most abundant entities on the planet.

""Viruses are understudied,"" he said. “We have no idea what the next entity will be, nobody expected this outbreak to take place and it's now consumed most of the world in a very short period.”

8,948,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released its 2019 Arctic Report Card on Tuesday, and folks, the results aren’t great.

The report details a rapidly changing Arctic environment featuring melting ice, a greener landscape, and, alarmingly, greenhouse-gas emissions on par with some large nations. The Arctic could be releasing upwards of 600 million tons of net carbon per year, the report finds, potentially putting the region alongside Mexico, Canada, and South Korea as one of the world’s largest contributors to atmospheric CO2. Though the carbon emitted from such industrialized nations is the result of burning fossil fuels, the hundreds of millions of metric tons pumping out of the Arctic is the result of thawing permafrost.

Permafrost being permafrost, it takes more than the seasons changing for it to actually melt it. The increasingly rapid thawing of frozen Arctic earth is the result of climate change, and the NOAA’s report card reveals that temperatures are continuing to rise in the world’s nether-regions, which aren’t as icy as they used to be. In August, for instance, the average sea surface temperatures in several highlighted Arctic bodies of water were 1-7 degrees Celsius warmer than the average from 1982-2010. Just as frightening: the average land surface temperature north of 60 degrees N was the second-warmest since 1900.

It’s not just permafrost that rising temperatures are affecting. The report also found:
• None The Greenland Ice Sheet is losing 267 billion metric tons of ice per year.
• None Two of the five lowest months for North American Arctic snow cover in the 53 years records have been kept occurred this summer.
• None Sea ice extent this summer was tied for the second-lowest since satellite imagery recorded coverage in 1979. Sea ice extent in the winter was also second-lowest, narrowly falling short of the lowest-ever total, which occurred in…2018.

These changes are threatening indigenous Arctic communities and Arctic wildlife directly, as well as the rest of the world, on a profound scale. The deteriorating Greenland Ice Sheet is causing the global sea level to rise 0.7 millimeters per year, and Arctic carbon emissions are helping cook the planet at a rate that will soon be irreversible unless dramatic steps are taken.

The need for urgent action was stressed Wednesday by teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who spoke to delegates at a United Nations climate summit in Madrid. “Our leaders are not behaving as though we were in an emergency,” said Thunberg, who the same day was named Time magazine’s Person of Year. “If there’s a child standing in the middle of the road and cars are coming at full speed, you don’t look away because it is too uncomfortable. You immediately run out and rescue that child. And without that sense of urgency, how can we, the people, understand that we are facing a real crisis.”

Some governing bodies are at least trying. The European Commission on Wednesday revealed plans for a European Green Deal that would reimagine the continent’s economy in accordance with the climate crisis.

Meanwhile, the president of the world’s second-largest carbon emitter is dismantling efforts to fight the problem and struggling to even feign concern. “Climate change is very important to me,” President Trump managed last week in London despite his penchant for slashing environmental regulations. “I’ve done many environmental impact statements over my life and I believe very strongly in very, very crystal clear, clean water and clean air. That’s a big part of climate change.”

9,941,"he historical record of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, claimed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the justification for greenhouse gas reduction, is a fraud. Research by a Freiburg, Germany professor, Ernst-Georg Beck of the Merian-Schule, shows that the IPCC construed and concocted the pre-1957 CO2 record from measurements on recently drilled ice cores, ignoring more than 0,000 direct measurements by chemical methods from 1857 to 1957.1 

 

 The IPCC’s hoked-up record attempts to prove that CO2 concentrations have been steadily increasing with the progress of human industrial civilization. Beck’s work confirms a wealth of previous investigations which demonstrate that the IPCC cherry-picked its data in an attempt to prove that we must stop industrial development and return to the horse-andbuggy age, or face oppressive heat and melting of the polar ice caps. It shows that the Kyoto Treaty on reduction of greenhouse gases was based on a scientific fraud which violates the laws of the universe, denying the well-established determination of climate by cyclical variations in the Earth-Sun orbital relationship and in the Sun’s heat output.

10,43,"The Covid-19 lockdown has cut climate change emissions - for now. But some governments want to go further by harnessing their economic recovery plans to boost low-carbon industries. Their slogan is ""Build Back Better"", but can they succeed?

I've just had a light bulb moment. The feisty little wren chirping loudly in the matted ivy outside my back door is telling us something important about global climate change.

That's because, intertwined with the melodious notes of a robin, I can actually hear its song clearly.

Normally, both birds are muffled by the insistent rumble of traffic, but the din has been all but extinguished in the peace of lockdown.

The drop in traffic is a major contributor to the fall in planet-warming CO2 emissions we've witnessed globally.

Before the Covid-19 crisis, we accepted the dominance of traffic noise as an inevitable consequence of city living.

Now, we have sampled an alternative urban ambience.

Governments currently face a stark choice: bail out polluting businesses, using that as leverage to impose environmentally-minded reforms, or let them return to their carbon-intensive activities as an economic quick fix.

But many members of the public have little desire to return to the state of affairs before lockdown.

In a poll, a fifth of members of the motoring group the AA, said they would work more from home in future.

This has implications for the UK government's £28bn road-building programme which assumes that traffic will rise by 1% per year - a conjecture that now looks unlikely.

The stay-at-home trend will be offset somewhat by nervous public transport users shunning trains for fear of infection, and by long-distance commuters who might decide that if they only need to visit the office three days a week, they'll buy a home even further away.

The AA, which for years was seen as the voice of motorists, has asked the government to think again about its £28bn road expansion. Its president, Edmund King, has suggested the money would be better spent on improving broadband

Another likely winner from the crisis is the movement fighting to turn city streets over to pedestrians and cyclists.

This has already happened in places like Paris, which is rolling out 650km of ""corona cycle-ways"", and Milan, which has a programme to prioritise pedestrians and cyclists.

The determination to seize the moment for environmental change stretches further than the transport sector.

The UK is one of several nations looking to reboot its environmental strategy by calling in favours from private industry. After all, it was government which bailed out employers when the crunch came in March. The catchphrase is ""Build Back Better"".

But it would seem to face a direct challenge in the shape of China and the US. The economies of both these superpowers have been savaged by the effects of coronavirus.

They are desperate to get back to pre-virus levels of output, so their leaders may think the surest means of doing so is through tried and trusted climate warming fossil fuels.

For those seeking a greener way out of the Covid-19 slump, renewable energy will help, along with electric vehicle charging points and broadband.

Frans Timmermans, vice president of the European Commission, is on the same track. He is leading work on a Green Deal to make the EU's economy sustainable and says that not a single Euro should be spent propping up old, dirty industries.

All Covid-19 recovery investment should go towards commerce that either helps reduce carbon emissions or promotes digital business, he insists.

But some MEPs from parties on the right warn that the pandemic will have ""far-reaching"" economic and social consequences.

They insist the EU must scale back its pre-crisis climate ambitions.

That's led some governments, like Germany and the UK, to offer hand-outs to polluting industries without imposing green conditions.

In the UK, the issue is causing contortions among politicians torn between saving existing jobs and conserving the planet.

MPs from the Liberal Democrats - thought of as one of the ""greenest"" UK parties - have joined other parliamentarians in demanding a conditional rescue for the airline industry.

They say that if ministers don't step in, tens of thousands of jobs will be lost.

But the firms should promise to off-set their emissions by, for example, planting trees.

Off-setting is hugely contentious. Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, argues: ""Any government bailout should focus on workers, not the industry itself.

""It should be conditional on the industry agreeing to shrink until - if ever - low-carbon technology is available - which isn't now.""

That begs a question: which industries should qualify for support? Should cash go exclusively to self-evidently green sectors like solar power - or to dirty firms trying to clean up?

Take the fossil fuel firms that pay our pension dividends by drilling for the stuff that's over-heating the world.

The UK's oil and gas industry warns that 30,000 jobs could be lost because of the pandemic and the current low oil price.

But why would governments support a commodity that's fuelling the climate crisis, which is judged by the UN to be deeper than the Covid-19 crisis?

Perhaps it's not that simple. Lord Stern, the former Treasury chief who's now a climate expert, told me each firm should be judged on its trajectory, not on its current state.

""The oil and gas industries are producing stuff you want to run down very quickly,"" he said. ""But you do see some companies - like BP and Shell - which are declaring they are moving in a direction where they want to be going zero carbon.

""So, you can't be indiscriminate or dogmatic. You have to look where the industry is going.""

At least UK environmentalists are dealing with firms that agree on the need to tackle climate change.

In the US, some fossil fuel firms have been determined to pursue government bail-outs without strings binding them to a less polluting future.

The Democratic Party has a long-standing proposal for a ""Green New Deal"" to promote clean technology. But President Donald Trump has minimised the importance of climate change. He has promised to help struggling fossil fuel firms, although his efforts have not taken root in a major way.

Then there's China. In 2015, its leaders were persuaded by President Barack Obama to make major climate change commitments as part of the Paris climate agreement.

Since then, China has suffered job losses and fuel shortages. Beijing has resorted to a quick fix for the economy by building coal-fired power plants.

The green think tank Global Energy Monitor says the number of plants China approved in the first three weeks of March 2020 - equivalent to 7,960 megawatts (MW) - was more than the number agreed in the whole of 2019 (6,310 MW).
• A SIMPLE GUIDE: How do I protect myself?
• AVOIDING CONTACT: The rules on self-isolation and exercise
• TESTING: Can I get tested for coronavirus?

That doesn't take into account China's estimated $1 trillion investment in its ""Belt and Road"" initiative to build huge, carbon-intensive infrastructure projects across developing countries.

Unless China and President Trump change their spots (or the Democratic candidate wins the US election), Europe's Build Back Better campaign won't be enough to protect the increasingly fragile climate, even if it does engineer a green recovery.

And we have a lesson from history. Nick Robins from the London School of Economics (LSE) estimates that in the global financial crisis of 2008 just 16% of global stimulus plans were green - mainly because China invested massively in fossil fuel projects.

He tells me: ""If we have any hope of combating climate change, we must make absolutely sure we do it better this time.""

11,885,"Ben Franklin once intoned that ""Beer is living proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy."" If Ben were alive today, he, and perhaps God himself, would be crying in his suds at the news coming out of the University of California, Irvine (UCI). It seems that if human-induced global warming continues on its current trajectory, the world's beer supply will dry up.

You read that right: If human-induced global warming continues on its current trajectory, the world's beer supply will dry up. Forget the other aspects of global warming: devastating and more frequent hurricanes; hotter-than-normal summers; longer droughts; wildfires; rising sea levels. We could run out of beer, people!

Researchers, in a study published Oct. 15, 2018, in the journal Nature Plants, ran the numbers and concluded that excessive and prolonged heat waves and droughts will ravage the world's barley supply. As any imbiber of beer will tell you, barley is the main ingredient in any good pint. As these fields of taste and wonder disappear, the laws of supply and demand will muscle in. Beer prices will surge, which means only the well-heeled will be able to afford a frosty mug of brew. No trickle-down economics here. The hoi polis — you, me and our friends — will be left high and dry. Ireland could see a 193 percent price increase, depending on the severity of conditions.

""The world is facing many life-threatening impacts of climate change, so people having to spend a bit more to drink beer may seem trivial by comparison,"" co-author Steven Davis, UCI associate professor of Earth system science said in a statement. ""But there is definitely a cross-cultural appeal to beer, and not having a cool pint at the end of an increasingly common hot day just adds insult to injury.""

Davis and his colleagues looked at how much fossil fuels humans are currently burning, and what they will burn in the future. They also looked at the levels of carbon dioxide emissions — the main greenhouse gas. If their models are accurate, the regions of the world where barley grows, especially the prairies of Canada, the northern Great Plains of the United States, and parts of Europe, Asia and Australia, will get hotter and drier, causing crop yields to decline 3 to 17 percent. Even modest warming will lead to more drought and heat in these areas, the scientists say.

As a result, beer prices will go up in beer-loving countries, including Belgium, Canada, Denmark and Poland. If you love spending time chugging in Ireland, you will need an extra $20 to buy a six-pack. Moreover, people in poorer countries will see beer consumption go down. Argentina, the researchers said, will see a 32 percent decrease in beer drinking. As for the United States, you'll see less keggers and beer pong, not to mention the occasional funnel.

""Our results show that in the most severe climate events, the supply of beer could decline by about 16 percent in years when droughts and heat waves strike,"" Davis said. ""That's comparable to all beer consumption in the U.S. Future climate and pricing conditions could put beer out of reach for hundreds of millions of people around the world.""

12,1248,"The global average atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2018 was 407.4 parts per million (ppm for short), with a range of uncertainty of plus or minus 0.1 ppm. Carbon dioxide levels today are higher than at any point in at least the past 800,000 years.

In fact, the last time the atmospheric CO amounts were this high was more than 3 million years ago, when temperature was 2°–3°C (3.6°–5.4°F) higher than during the pre-industrial era, and sea level was 15–25 meters (50–80 feet) higher than today.

Carbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people are burning for energy. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain carbon that plants pulled out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis over the span of many millions of years; we are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years.

Squeeze or stretch the graph in either direction by holding the Shift key while you click and drag. The bright red line (source data) shows monthly average carbon dioxide at NOAA's Mauna Loa Observatory on Hawai'i in parts per million (ppm): the number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air. Over the course of the year, values are higher in Northern Hemisphere winter and lower in summer. The dark red line shows the annual trend, calculated as a 12-month rolling average.

According to the State of the Climate in 2018 report from NOAA and the American Meteorological Society, global atmospheric carbon dioxide was 407.4 ± 0.1 ppm in 2018, a new record high. That is an increase of 2.5 ± 0.1 ppm from 2017, similar to the increase of 2.2 ± 0.1 ppm between 2016 and 2017.

In the 1960s, the global growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide was roughly 0.6 ± 0.1 ppm per year. Over the past decade, however, the growth rate has been closer to 2.3 ppm per year. The annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is about 100 times faster than previous natural increases, such as those that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.

Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Warmed by sunlight, Earth’s land and ocean surfaces continuously radiate thermal infrared energy (heat). Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of our atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb that heat and release it gradually over time, like bricks in a fireplace after the fire goes out. Without this natural greenhouse effect, Earth’s average annual temperature would be below freezing instead of close to 60°F. But increases in greenhouse gases have tipped the Earth's energy budget out of balance, trapping additional heat and raising Earth's average temperature.

Carbon dioxide is the most important of Earth’s long-lived greenhouse gases. It absorbs less heat per molecule than the greenhouse gases methane or nitrous oxide, but it’s more abundant and it stays in the atmosphere much longer. And while carbon dioxide is less abundant and less powerful than water vapor on a molecule per molecule basis, it absorbs wavelengths of thermal energy that water vapor does not, which means it adds to the greenhouse effect in a unique way. Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide are responsible for about two-thirds of the total energy imbalance that is causing Earth's temperature to rise.

Another reason carbon dioxide is important in the Earth system is that it dissolves into the ocean like the fizz in a can of soda. It reacts with water molecules, producing carbonic acid and lowering the ocean's pH. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the pH of the ocean's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10. This drop in pH is called ocean acidification.

A drop of 0.1 may not seem like a lot, but the pH scale is logarithmic; a 1-unit drop in pH means a tenfold increase in acidity. A change of 0.1 means a roughly 30% increase in acidity. Increasing acidity interferes with the ability of marine life to extract calcium from the water to build their shells and skeletons.

Natural increases in carbon dioxide concentrations have periodically warmed Earth’s temperature during ice age cycles over the past million years or more. The warm episodes (interglacials) began with a small increase in sunlight due to a tiny wobble in Earth’s axis of rotation or in the path of its orbit around the Sun.

That little bit of extra sunlight caused a little bit of warming. As the oceans warmed, they outgassed carbon dioxide—like a can of soda going flat in the heat of a summer day. The extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere amplified the initial warming.

Based on air bubbles trapped in mile-thick ice cores (and other paleoclimate evidence), we know that during the ice age cycles of the past million years or so, carbon dioxide never exceeded 300 ppm. Before the Industrial Revolution started in the mid-1700s, the global average amount of carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm.

By the time continuous observations began at Mauna Loa Volcanic Observatory in 1958, global atmospheric carbon dioxide was already 315 ppm. On May 9, 2013, the daily average carbon dioxide measured at Mauna Loa surpassed 400 ppm for the first time on record. Less than two years later, in 2015, the global amount went over 400 ppm for the first time. If global energy demand continues to grow and to be met mostly with fossil fuels, atmospheric carbon dioxide is projected to exceed 900 ppm by the end of this century.

13,712,"Melbourne, 25 June 2012: Australian infectious disease therapy and vaccine development company BioDiem Ltd (ASX: BDM) announced today the signing of a licensing agreement with Australian National University (ANU). This agreement is for an exclusive global license to commercialise a novel vaccine technology from the John

 Curtin School of Medical Research at ANU. Dengue Fever is the lead indication, but the technology may also facilitate the design of vaccines against a number of other infectious diseases including Murray River encephalitis and Japanese encephalitis. The increasing incidence of mosquito-borne disease is a major health concern worldwide as climate change expands the range of the carrier mosquitoes, exposing larger human populations.

The agreement includes provision for BioDiem to sublicense the technology. Industry standard royalties apply, but apart from a small contribution towards patent registration costs there is no up-front outlay for BioDiem. The agreement follows the signing of a term sheet announced to the ASX on 6 June 2012. Dengue Fever is a disease caused by a mosquito-borne virus that affects between 50 and 100 million people a year, and according to the World Health Organization the incidence is increasing significantly. Although only a

 small percentage of cases are fatal, non-fatal cases can be extremely debilitating. Dengue Fever currently has no existing vaccine, and control methods currently include attempts to address mosquito populations with varying effectiveness.

The technology is complementary to the BioDiem portfolio as well as the company's strategic focus on vaccines and therapies for infectious diseases and related cancers.

""We are delighted to announce the completion of this licensing agreement, which sees BioDiem's commercial expertise in the area of vaccines fittingly partnered with the exciting research developed by ANU. Our focus on infectious diseases is an excellent fit for this new technology which has strong potential as an asset for outlicensing"" said BioDiem CEO Julie Phillips. BioDiem's current strategy for the ANU technology includes leveraging the company's global partnering network to deliver an outlicensing partner for development of the technology, providing an opportunity to secure a royalties stream without significant development costs on the part of BioDiem.

BioDiem is an ASX-listed company based in Melbourne with an international focus on discovering, developing and commercialising world-class research and technology targeting cancers and infectious diseases. BioDiem's core technologies include the Live Attenuated Influenza Virus (LAIV), the SAVINE platform and the BDM-I

 antimicrobial compound. The LAIV influenza vaccine is an intranasal vaccine to prevent infection from seasonal and pandemic influenza. The LAIV influenza vaccine can be produced using both egg-based and cell-based manufacturing methods. The cell-based LAIV vaccine has completed a Phase II clinical trial in Europe. The egg-based LAIV vaccine

 technology is licensed to the World Health Organization as part of the Global Pandemic Influenza Action Plan to Increase Vaccine Supply. The LAIV influenza vaccine is marketed as Nasovac™ in India by the Serum Institute of India, and has been licensed to China-based Changchun BCHT Biotechnology Co. The LAIV vaccine was in-licensed from the

 Institute of Experimental Medicine in St Petersburg, Russia where it has been used for over a decade in many millions of people - children, adults and the elderly. The LAIV is administered by nasal spray and induces a rapid immune response in the mucosal lining of the nose and pharynx. The LAIV is also being developed as a viral vector for making novel non-influenza vaccines for different diseases including cancers. Viruses have the ability to generate proteins prolifically and can be programmed to produce

 disease-specific proteins. As part of a vaccine, disease-specific proteins can help generate a beneficial immune response. SAVINE (patented Scrambled Antigen Vaccine) is a platform technology for the design of antigens for incorporation into vaccines targeting an immune response to a range of different diseases. SAVINE antigens are encoded as synthetic genes which, together with a delivery technology such as BioDiem's LAIV-based vaccine vector technology, can be used to develop novel vaccines. BDM-I is a synthetic compound targeted at the treatment of serious human infections. BDM-I is in the preclinical stage with outlicensing as the intended outcome. BDM-I is active against a range of pathogenic micro-organisms including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi and protozoa. Key patents have been filed around BDM-I's antimicrobial activity, including for activity against Plasmodium falciparum, responsible for causing the most commonly severe form of malaria, and Trichomonas vaginalis, the protozoan responsible for causing a common sexually transmitted disease named trichomoniasis. BioDiem is also developing BDM-E, a tetra peptide synthetic compound, as a treatment for ophthalmic disorders. The US Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) has granted Orphan Drug designation to BDM-E for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa, a serious degenerative disease of the retina.

14,123,"In addition to the already existing pressure on our freshwater resources, climate change may further decrease water availability. In this study, projections of future water resources, due to climate change, land use change and changes in water consumption have been assessed using JRC’s LISFLOOD water resources model. The results presented are based on 11 climate models which project current and future climate under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5 emission scenario. RCP4.5 may be viewed as a moderate-emissions-mitigation-policy scenario and RCP8.5 as a high-end emissions scenario. A 30-year window around the year that global warming reaches 1.5oC, 2oC and 3oC above preindustrial temperature has been analysed and compared to the 1981-2010 control climate window (baseline). The 1.5°C and 2°C warming scenarios are explicitly considered in the Paris Agreement, while a 3°C global warming is a scenario that could be expected by the end of the 21st century if adequate mitigation strategies are not taken. First, we performed future projections without socio-economic developments to show the effect of climate change only. Next, an integrated assessment is performed including future changes in land use, water demand and population. This allows us to disentangle the effects of climate and socio-economic changes. In general, the climate projections reveal a typically North-South pattern across Europe for water availability. Overall, Southern European countries are projected to face decreasing water availability, particularly Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Italy and Turkey. Central and Northern European countries show an increasing annual water availability.",mainstream,M07c04,climate.change

16,1022,"From warmer temperatures to more extreme weather, melting glaciers and rising sea levels, humanity is fundamentally changing the planet by pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, US government scientists said on 3 November in their latest assessment of climate science.

The average global temperature has increased by 1 °C since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the 600-page report says — adding that the last 115 years comprise “the warmest period in the history of modern civilization”. The analysis warns that temperatures could increase another 4°C by the end of the century, with dramatic consequences for humans and natural ecosystems.

The findings are at odds with the policies of US President Donald Trump, who has questioned well-established tenets of climate science and vowed to protect and promote the US fossil-fuel industry. Trump's stances led many scientists to worry that his administration would try to block or tamper with the climate-change assessment, but several scientists who helped to write the document reported no problems.

“We weren’t interfered with, and we ended up producing something that I think is of tremendous value,” says David Fahey, an atmospheric scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colorado, and a coordinating lead author of the analysis.

The climate-science report is the first volume of the fourth National Climate Assessment, a legally mandated analysis of the causes and impacts of global warming that is due in 2018. The other two parts of the forthcoming assessment were released today in draft form, for public comment. One analysis focuses on how climate change is affecting life in the United States, from crop yields to property damage from extreme weather. The other summarizes the latest findings on the global carbon cycle. Both of those documents will undergo a formal review by the US National Academy of Sciences.

“The science speaks for itself,” says Don Wuebbles, a a climate scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and co-chair of the climate-science report. “It’s hard to counteract the basic observations and the truth of the science with any kind of political playing around.”

The trio of documents paints a dramatic picture of how global warming is affecting people and communities across the United States. Tidal flooding is accelerating in more than 25 coastal cities along the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Large forest fires have become more frequent in the western part of the country, while warmer spring temperatures and shrinking mountain snowpack are combining to reduce the amount of water available to the region's cities and farms. As a result, the draft climate-impacts report warns, “chronic, long-duration hydrological drought is increasingly possible before the end of the century”.

The report comes just days before the latest United Nations climate talks kick off in Bonn, Germany. It will also be the first major summit since Trump vowed to pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris climate pact.

Few observers expect US government's latest set of climate-change analyses to affect how the Trump administation approaches energy and environmental issues. In August, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration disbanded an advisory committee that was intended to help the nation prepare for a warmer climate, by translating the findings of the coming climate assessment into guidance for cities, states and industry.

Nor is it clear whether senior Trump administration officials will accept the reports' core scientific conclusions. As recently as March, US Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt said he did not believe that carbon dioxide is major driver of global warming.

Nonetheless, many scientists and environmentalists lauded the new reports for bolstering the case for more-aggressive action against climate change.

“The full assessment, when it gets published, is going to show that there are palpable impacts that are going to hit every part of the country,” says Andrew Light, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute, an environmental think-tank in Washington DC. “It’s the responsibility of leaders to take note of that and act accordingly.”",mainstream,M122c9,climate.change

18,532,"John Quincy Adams was the sixth president of the United States. He was also the eldest son of President John Adams, the second U.S. president.

John Quincy Adams was the eldest son of President John Adams and the sixth president of the United States. In his pre-presidential years, Adams was one of America's greatest diplomats (formulating, among other things, what became the Monroe Doctrine); in his post-presidential years, he conducted a consistent and often dramatic fight against the expansion of slavery. Though full of promise, his presidential years were difficult. He died in 1848 in Washington, D.C.

Though he was one of few Americans to be so prepared to serve as president of the United States, John Quincy Adams's best years of service came before and after his time in the White House. Born on July 11, 1767, in Braintree, Massachusetts, John Quincy was the son of John Adams, a prodigy of the American Revolution who would become the second U.S. president just before his John Quincy's 30th birthday, and his wife, future first lady Abigail Adams. As a child, Adams witnessed firsthand the birth of the nation. From the family farm, he and his mother watched the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775. At age 10, he traveled to France with his father, who was securing aid during the Revolution. By age 14, Adams was receiving ""on-the-job"" training in the diplomatic corps and going to school. In 1781, he accompanied diplomat Francis Dana to Russia, serving as his secretary and translator. In 1783, he traveled to Paris to serve as secretary to his father, negotiating the Treaty of Paris. During this time, Adams attended schools in Europe and became fluent in French, Dutch and German. Returning home in 1785, he entered Harvard College and graduated in 1787.

In 1790, Adams became a practicing attorney in Boston. As tensions mounted between Britain and France, he supported President George Washington's neutrality policy of 1793. President Washington appreciated young Adams's support so much that he appointed him U.S. minister to Holland. When his father was elected president in 1797, he appointed his son U.S. minister to Prussia. On the way to his post, Adams traveled to England to wed Louisa Catherine Johnson, the daughter of Joshua Johnson, the first U.S. consul to Great Britain. After his father lost his bid for a second term in 1800, he recalled his son from Prussia. In 1802, Adams was elected to the Massachusetts legislature, and one year later, he was elected the U.S. Senate. Like his father, Adams was considered a member of the Federalist Party, but in truth, he was never a strict party man. During his time in the Senate, he supported the Louisiana Purchase and President Thomas Jefferson's Embargo Act—actions that made him very unpopular with other Federalists. In June 1808, Adams broke with the Federalists, resigned from his Senate seat and became a Democratic-Republican. Adams returned to the diplomatic corps in 1809, when President James Madison appointed him the first officially recognized minister to Russia (Francis Dana was never officially accepted as a U.S. ambassador by the Russian government). In 1814, Adams was recalled from Russia to serve as chief negotiator for the U.S. government during the Treaty of Ghent, settling the War of 1812. The following year, Adams served as minister to England, a position his father had held 30 years earlier. In a post he was most suited for, Adams served as secretary of state in President James Monroe's administration from 1817 to 1825. During this time, he negotiated the Adams-Onis Treaty, acquiring Florida for the United States. He also helped negotiate the Treaty of 1818, settling the long-standing border dispute between Britain and the United States over the Oregon Country, and initiating improved relations between Great Britain and its former colonies.

By age 50, Adams had amassed a very impressive record of public service, but perhaps his most notable and enduring achievement was the Monroe Doctrine. After the Napoleonic wars had ended, several Latin American colonies of Spain rose up and declared independence. A defining moment for the United States, Adams crafted the Monroe Doctrine, which stated the United States would resist any European country's efforts to thwart independence movements in Latin America; the doctrine, first introduced in 1823, served to justify U.S. intervention in Latin America throughout the late 19th and most of the 20th centuries.

By 1824, Adams was well-positioned to be the next president of the United States. However, the political climate had changed the way presidents were elected at the time; only the Democratic-Republican Party was viable and five candidates emerged, each representing different sections of the country. Running against Adams were Southerners John C. Calhoun and William Crawford, and Westerners Henry Clay and Andrew Jackson. In addition, by the 1824 election, 18 of 24 states had moved to choose electors to the Electoral College by popular vote instead of to state legislatures. In the Electoral College vote, no one candidate had a clear majority and, subsequently, the election was sent to the House of Representatives. Clay threw his support to Adams, who was elected on the first ballot. Adams's victory shocked Jackson, who had won the popular vote and fully expected to be president. When Adams later appointed Clay secretary of state, Jackson Democrats cried ""corrupt bargain,"" and were enraged at the seemingly quid pro quo arrangement.

Adams entered the presidency with several debilitating political liabilities. He possessed the temperament of his father: Aloof, stubborn and ferociously independent in his convictions. As president, Adams failed to develop the political relationships needed—even among members of his own party—to effect significant change. It didn't help that his political opponents were set on making him a one-term president. In his first year in office, Adams proposed several far-sighted programs that he felt would promote science, as well as encourage a spirit of enterprise and invention in the United States; these goals included building a network of highways and canals to link the different sections of the country, setting aside public lands for conservation, surveying the entire U.S. coast and building astronomical observatories. Adams also saw the need for practical solutions to universal problems, thusly calling for the establishment of a uniform system of weights and measures and improving the patent system. While these may have been admirable goals for an aspiring nation, they were considered overambitious and unrealistic for the United States in the 1820s. Adams's proposals were met with scorn and derision by political opponents; critics charged that the president's policies would enlarge the powers and influence of the federal government at the expense of the state and local governments, and some accused Adams of promoting programs to enhance the elite and neglect the common people. In the midterm election of 1826, Jacksonian opponents won majorities in both Houses of Congress. As a result, many of Adams's initiatives either failed to pass legislation or were woefully underfunded. The election of 1828 was an especially bitter and personal affair. As was the tradition, neither candidate personally campaigned, but supporters conducted ruthless attacks on the opposing candidates. The campaign reached a low point when the press accused Jackson's wife, Rachel, of bigamy. Adams lost the election by a decisive margin, and he left Washington without attending Jackson's inauguration.

Adams did not retire from public life after leaving the presidential office. In 1830, he ran for and won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, once again distinguishing himself as a statesman of the first order. In 1836, Adams focused his long-standing anti-slavery sentiment on defeating a gag-rule instituted by Southerners to stifle debate. In 1841, he argued in front of the Supreme Court on behalf of escaped African slaves in the famous Amistad case, and won the release of the captives. On February 21, 1848, in his last contribution to his country, Adams was on the floor of the House of Representatives, arguing to honor U.S. Army officers who had served in the Mexican-American War (he opposed the war, but felt that the U.S. government was obligated to honor its veterans). During the event, Adams suddenly collapsed, suffering from a massive cerebral hemorrhage. He was taken to the Speaker's Room in the Capitol Building, where he died two days later, on February 23, 1848.",mainstream,M0cd8b,climate.change

More than 100 bushfires are raging in Australia as the continent swelters under record heat, a double whammy of extremes that has amplified scrutiny of what experts say is stark inaction from the government on climate change.

Blazes across New South Wales and Queensland have scorched almost 7 million acres, and Australia experienced its hottest day on record Wednesday, when the average temperature across the country hit 105 degrees.

The nation's woes are unfolding as Australia faces criticism for what have been described as its inadequate climate policies, including the role of federal officials in thwarting negotiations at a recent U.N. summit on climate change.

Richie Merzian, director of the climate and energy program at the Australia Institute, a Canberra-based think tank that conducts public policy research, called the 2019 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change a letdown. The summit ended Sunday in a stalemate, with countries largely delaying major decisions on plans to cut carbon emissions until next year's conference.

""It was terribly disappointing,"" Merzian said. ""Australia is literally on fire right now, and it's clearly linked to climate change in terms of its severity and duration. But instead of going there to rally the world behind the need for greater climate action, Australia was lobbying to do as little as possible.""

Seasonal bushfires occur naturally in Australia, but hotter and drier conditions due to climate change have increased the frequency of fires and their severity, said Andy Pitman, a climate modeler at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.

""There is an uncontroversial link whereby higher carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere from climate change increase bushfire risk,"" Pitman said. ""All other things being equal, a fire that occurs now will be worse than a fire that occurred 20 to 30 years ago.""

Trees play an integral role in the planet's carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide as they grow. But research has shown that when vegetation dries out — as during hot and dry summer months — the increased amount of carbon dioxide acts as extra fuel for wildfires.

Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, release greenhouse gases that trap heat and raise surface temperatures. A 2018 State of the Climate report from the Australian government's Bureau of Meteorology found that the country has warmed by just over 1 degree Celsius since 1910, ""leading to an increase in the frequency of extreme heat events.""

Those heat waves, combined with dry conditions, are dangerous ingredients for bushfires, Pitman said, with circumstances appearing to be particularly severe at the moment.

""This is unprecedented,"" Pitman said. ""I don't think we've ever seen bushfires at this scale before.""

Bushfires are also problematic because they release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Australia's fires are estimated to have emitted 250 million tons of carbon dioxide already — nearly half of the nation's total yearly average emissions — according to NASA data provided to The Guardian.

Those events have renewed focus on Australia's prime minister, Scott Morrison, who has refused to answer questions about climate change and their link to the fires. His conservative administration has also faced backlash for its policies and rhetoric surrounding global warming.

In November, Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said climate change concerns were stoked by ""raving inner-city lefties,"" adding that there had been fires in Australia ""since time began.""

Pitman said that while there had been some progress made on the state level, the federal government had shown a lack of political will.

""They almost see it as a negotiating or debating point, and it's not,"" Pitman said. ""This is an existential risk to communities and major regions of the planet, and if governments don't act, then the situation will simply deteriorate.""

Imran Ahmad, a climate scientist at Australian National University, said the Morrison administration's stance was symptomatic of Australia's complex history of climate change policy.

""There is an ideological drive against climate change by certain vested interests,"" he said.

Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal and its third-largest exporter of fossil fuels, after Russia and Saudi Arabia. Merzian, who worked as a climate negotiator for the government for almost a decade, said those economic ties have shaped the country's climate policies for decades — and invite international criticism.

""You can't be the largest exporter of coal, which is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions when consumed, and not take any responsibility for that,"" Merzian said.

In 2012, Australia's Labor Government introduced a carbon tax that helped the country reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 1.4 percent by the end of its second year. But the policy was unpopular, and in 2014, the newly elected government repealed the tax.

""Any new tax is unpopular, but unfortunately, by the time it was dismantled, we could see that it was working,"" Merzian said. ""It was reducing emissions, but it just didn't have enough momentum to survive quite a strong negative campaign.""

As one of the countries that ratified the 2015 Paris Agreement, a global pact aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, Australia will join 187 other countries in pledging to meet its reduction goals next year. Pitman said Australia has much at stake, with fragile ecosystems, such as the Great Barrier Reef, under severe threat from warming oceans and the country's bushfires. Still, he added, it's difficult to be optimistic about the country's direction.

""The Great Barrier Reef is a multibillion-dollar asset to Australia, and it's being sacrificed at the altar of carbon dioxide emissions,"" he said. ""It's really important to understand that decisions that need to be made on carbon emission are politically painful, and there is no one more skilled at avoiding difficult political decisions than politicians.""",mainstream,M0a42a,climate.change
20,63,"Climate Change - what are we doing?

The council adopted a Climate Change Strategy in April 2014, which was refreshed in 2017 to bring it up to speed with other local and national developments in the climate change agenda. It included the adoption of national targets around carbon emission reductions and the use of renewable energy. The following three pledges underpin the work the council has been doing on climate change:
• To lead by example in reducing its carbon emissions year on year.
• To help residents, community groups and businesses to reduce their emissions and manage climate risks.
• To work with partners to help raise awareness and support initiatives to reduce and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

We are now developing a draft Climate Change and Air Quality Strategy that we plan to publish for consultation later in 2020. This will outline the steps that we’ll be taking to tackle the issue and reduce our impact on the environment.

The drive to become a carbon neutral borough by 2030 starts now and we have started work to set out the steps we as a council can take and how we can work together as a borough.

In December 2019, we held a climate change summit to bring together ideas with partners. View a copy of the presentation and the Outcomes Report.

Already we have:
• Installed solar panels on the roof of several of our council buildings.
• Improved the energy performance of the council’s Deanes and Parklands buildings
• Set up a group of Environment Champions to promote sustainable practices among staff.
• Installed a fresh air cooling system at the Civic Offices, as well as being environmentally-friendly, the initiative will generate a saving of £9,500 per year.
• Reduced the distances our bin trucks travel by rebalancing the rounds, with a monthly carbon saving of 3.8% per month.

With partners, we have:
• Adopted a transport strategy with a focus on encouraging more sustainable transport including cycling and walking.
• Given out loans and grants to improve insulation and install renewable energy sources.
• Supported residents to apply for government funding for energy efficient boilers.

We are working on our next steps looking at greener ways of delivering council services. Here are just a few of the projects we are working on:
• With advice from the Energy Savings Trust we are exploring greater use of electric vehicles.
• Updating our Local Plan to ensure tougher standards associated with climate change and emissions.
• Reviewing the energy efficiency of our accommodation and our staff and councillors’ travel.
• Delivering 3,500 homes at Manydown using the Garden Towns’ principle.",mainstream,M0a2ee,climate.change
21,331,"Does wearing tight pants or underwear like tighty-whities affect sperm count?

 – Carson*

Although some studies have shown a decrease in sperm count from wearing tight-fitting underwear, others have not.

The testicles may seem like they just get in the way sometimes. But the main reason ""the boys"" are on the outside of the body is because the body's internal temperature of 98.6°F is too hot for sperm production. So by ""hanging out,"" the scrotum keeps sperm a few degrees cooler.

Too much heat can lower sperm count (but not enough to act as a form of birth control). So tight clothing and underwear that keep testicles closer to body heat might, in theory, affect sperm count. But many experts think there isn't enough of a temperature change to make any significant difference.

22,1041,"Edward Snowden, the hacker who gained access to every secret corner of the Internet during his tenure at the NSA, has come forward with details of a classified project to alter the world’s climate. The shocking truth, as he says, is that chemtrails are part of a benevolent program aimed at countering global warming. By cooperating in secret with jet fuel manufacturers, government agents have carefully kept the massive chemtrail efforts completely under wraps.

“I am only revealing this program because there is no oversight in the scientific community, no public discussion, and little concern for the side-effects which are well known only to a few privileged people interested in continuing the decades-long chemtrail program in secret.”

According to Snowden, chemtrails are the only thing keeping the US from global warming incineration, but at what price?

Because climate change is a threat to U.S. agriculture, it has been labeled a national security issue. With the influence and cooperation of Monsanto, a secret Geo-engineering lab dubbed Muad’Dib has been operating since the late 1960s, and the chemtrail program is often referred to by insiders as its “crown jewel.” Muad’Dib has aimed to protect North America’s climate at all costs – even if that means accelerating desertification in Sub-Saharan Africa or spreading trace amounts of carcinogens over lightly populated areas. Other side effects, which scientists at the secret Muad’Dib Geoengineering Lab have predicted, include droughts in the Amazon and powerful windstorms along the East Coast.

Snowden shared decisive documents with The Internet Chronicle, but out of concern for national security, only his testimonial can be published. These documents contain references to scientists who would surely be targeted by foreign counterintelligence, and their knowledge is vital to short-term survival of the United States.

Snowden said, “If this program were to stop, the scientists behind it strongly believe that within just one year the North American climate would spiral out of control, and crop failures would lead to a series of devastating famines that would quickly depopulate urban centers.”

Because the program has been carried out on such a massive scale, skeptics might find Snowden’s story unbelievable. However, Snowden explained that the chemtrail program has been incredibly easy to hide, especially with the cooperation of jet fuel companies, a crucial part of the military-industrial complex. Snowden said, “The chemicals which are released by passenger airplanes have been covertly introduced as ‘additives,’ supposedly to improve efficiency. Only as the plane reaches cruising velocity does the heat and atmospheric pressure cause a chemical reaction that synthesizes the top secret carbon-trapping molecule. This process is imperfect, and many of the by-products are incredibly dangerous even in trace quantities. The most dangerous thing is that although chemtrails are keeping the climate of the U.S. reasonably stable, citizens are bombarded every day with an invisible rain of carbon-laden molecules, and the effect on health is totally unknown.”",conspiracy,C01b2d,chemtrails; climate.change

Malcolm Roberts believes the United Nations is attempting to create an unelected global government

The BBC has asked Mr Roberts for an interview and submitted questions to him by email, but has not received a reply.

One Nation leader Pauline Hanson will wield considerable power in Australia’s Senate

But in recent interviews with the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC), Mr Roberts stood by his previous positions.

He called for an investigation into Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) over its handling of climate change science.

When asked if he still believed the UN was trying to impose a worldwide government through climate change policy, Mr Roberts answered: “Definitely”.

In 2011, Mr Roberts wrote a letter to then Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard demanding to be exempted from the country’s carbon tax.

The letter, addressed to “The Woman, Julia-Eileen:Gillard”, contained a 28-point affidavit that sought to establish Mr Roberts’ exemption from the need to obey the Australian government.

He referred to himself as “Malcolm-Ieuan: Roberts., the living soul”, and identified himself as the “beneficiary, administrator” for a corporate entity called MALCOLM IEUAN ROBERTS.

 A screen grab of the letter Mr Roberts sent to Ms Gillard, expressing a view that Australia may be a US corporation

However, in a radio interview with the ABC, Mr Roberts denied that he was affiliated with the movement.

Mr Roberts also wrote a report in 2013 entitled CSRIOh!: Climate of Deception, Or First Step to Freedom? that detailed his rejection of man-made global warming.

“The UN IPCC’s unfounded core claim about human CO2 is part of UN Agenda 21 campaign for global governance,” the report said.

In a 135-page appendix to the report, Mr Roberts wrote in detail about his belief that an international cabal of bankers is exercising enormous influence on world affairs.

The report says the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England are privately controlled corporations, and that their owners are seeking to introduce carbon trading into the world economy as a way to generate money and extend their control.

It also lists Holocaust denier and conspiracy theorist Eustace Mullins as a primary reference.

Mr Roberts has been criticised in the past by prominent Australian climate sceptic Andrew Bolt, who said his theories on banking families “smacks too much of the Jewish world conspiracy theorising I’ve always loathed”.

26,774,"People often confuse the concepts of global warming and climate change, and it doesn’t help that media companies often substitute one for the other in TV, newspaper, and social media reporting. This is somewhat understandable since the two concepts overlap a great deal. In fact, there is a causal relationship between the two. However, there are some subtle and some not-so-subtle differences between global warming and climate change.

The phrase global warming is used by scientists to mean a long-term increase in Earth’s average air temperature. It can refer specifically to such warming that is due to the influence of rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Earth’s surface gets most of its heat from the energy associated with the Sun’s rays, which strike the planet’s surface during the day. At night most of this energy is radiated back into space. Greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides, and chlorofluorocarbons [CFCs]) absorb infrared radiation (net heat energy) emitted from Earth’s surface and radiate it back to the surface, thus contributing to the greenhouse effect. Though the recent rise in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is arguably the main factor affecting global warming, other factors are involved (such as variations in Earth’s orbit, the angle of the planet’s axis, and variations in the Sun’s energy output). Nevertheless, as higher concentrations of greenhouse gases allow Earth’s atmosphere to hold on to greater amounts of heat that would normally escape into space at night, Earth’s average temperature rises.

Climate change is a bit different. Before we look into what climate change is, it may be helpful to think a bit about climate with respect to weather. Weather, which is often confused with climate, is the set of conditions in the atmosphere in one location for a limited period of time, such as throughout the day, at night, or at any particular point during the day. Climate, on the other hand, is the average condition of the atmosphere in a given location over a long period of time, such as 30 years or more. Thus, climate change is a longer-term change in the average condition of the atmosphere.

Human beings most certainly contribute to climate change by adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, but this is only part of the equation. Earth’s climate can change over time not only because of changes in the atmosphere but also because of interactions between the atmosphere and various geologic, chemical, biological, and geographic factors. For example, regional climates (as well as Earth’s global climate) can change in response to a sustained period of heavy volcanic activity. Much of that activity is related in turn to the movement of Earth’s tectonic plates, which drives the continents across the surface of the planet. Over hundreds of thousands to millions of years, the continents collide with other continents or break apart, changing the paths of ocean currents and local winds. This affects the transport of heat from the tropics to the poles. Earth’s global climate has also changed in response to drastic changes in atmospheric chemistry—notably the rise in oxygen concentrations billions of years ago when plants, algae, and other forms of life capable of photosynthesis began to spread across the planet.

As the world continues to come to grips with how human activities influence Earth’s climate, the tangible effects of climate change that is caused by global warming—such as melting glaciers and ice caps, rising sea levels, and changes in seasonal temperature and rainfall patterns—are becoming the focus. With such disruptions becoming more and more apparent, many scientists are discussing them increasingly in terms of real long-term climatic changes rather than simply remarking about Earth’s average temperature. Consequently, climate change can also refer to the cause-and-effect relationship between global warming and climate change. That is, it can refer to a change in the average condition of the atmosphere brought on by global warming.",mainstream,M0950f,climate.change; global.warming

With his environmental documentary “2040,” writer-director Damon Gameau set out to create a letter from the future, a self-described “exercise in fact-based dreaming,” for his 4-year-old daughter Velvet. His goal: present Velvet and her generation a positive path for battling climate change utilizing only solutions that are presently available.

Gameau initiated this vision of the future by asking 100 children from around the world what they would like 2040 to look like. He was startled by how aware the kids (ages 6-11) are of the challenges the world is facing and weaves their voices into the film as an unjaded chorus of boundless potential (“Clean water!” “End deforestation!” “Rocket boots!” “National hot dog day!”).

Turning to experts in various fields, Gameau learns about solar-powered microgrids, localized economies, electric self-driving cars, urban food farms, regenerative agriculture, marine permaculture, resource awareness and increased educational opportunities for girls (perhaps the most surprising element presented). Every solution is then dramatized as to how it might affect the world of a 20-something Velvet.

The effect is inspiring and empowering. Fanciful animation, graphics and special effects, abetted by Gameau’s down under whimsy, make the film as entertaining as it is educational. Powered by unbridled optimism, Gameau defies skeptics by doing his homework and bringing receipts.

2.79 inches of rain came down in just one hour in Washington D.C.

Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has attempted to blame Republicans for the historic flash flooding that occurred in the nation’s capital Monday. 



2.79 inches of rain came down in just one hour in Washington D.C., which beat the 1945 record of 2.05 inches in the same period, The Washington Post reported.

But AOC seemingly blamed Republicans and their support for the fossil fuel industry for the reason behind the flooding.

“Unprecedented flooding is quickly becoming a new normal,” she tweeted.

“Despite that, Republicans are tripling down on fossil fuels w/no plan to transition off them, or make the critical infra investments we need to prep for the climate crisis.”

“Climate change intensifies flooding, wildfires, & extreme weather. It’s more than 1 day or 1 storm; it’s all of them.""

""Places are flooding where they haven’t before; there are 90-degree days in Alaska in June.""

""The GOP will mock & sow confusion until it’s their home swept away,” she added.

But Ocasio-Cortez failed to explain how fossil fuels and Monday morning’s historic flooding were related.

30,261,"How To Discuss “Climate Change” With A ‘Woke’ Teenager

After our daughter of fifteen years of age was moved to tears by the speech of Greta Thunberg at the UN the other day, she became angry with our generation “who had been doing nothing for thirty years.”

So, we decided to help her prevent what the girl on TV announced of “massive eradication and the disappearance of entire ecosystems.”

We are now committed to give our daughter a future again, by doing our part to help cool the planet four degrees.

From now on she will go to school on a bicycle, because driving her by car costs fuel, and fuel puts emissions into the atmosphere. Of course it will be winter soon and then she will want to go by bus, but cycling through the freezing builds resilience.

Of course, she is now asking for an electric bicycle, but we have shown her the devastation caused to the areas of the planet as a result of mining for the extraction of Lithium and other minerals used to make batteries for electric bicycles, so she will be pedaling, or walking.

Which will not harm her, or the planet. We used to cycle and walk to school too.

Since the girl on TV demanded “we need to get rid of our dependency on fossil fuels” and our daughter agreed with her, we have disconnected the heat vent in her room. The temperature is now dropping to twelve degrees in the evening, and will drop below freezing in the winter, we have promised to buy her an extra sweater, hat, tights, gloves and a blanket.

For the same reason we have decided that from now on she only takes a cold shower. She will wash her clothes by hand, with a wooden washboard, because the washing machine is simply a power consumer and since the dryer uses natural gas, she will hang her clothes on the clothes line to dry, just like my parents and grandparents used to do.

Speaking of clothes, the ones that she currently has are all synthetic, so made from petroleum. Therefore on Monday, we will bring all her designer clothing to the secondhand shop.

We have found an eco store where the only clothing they sell is made from undyed and unbleached linen and jute. Also can’t have clothes made on wool, because the emissions from farting sheep are supposedly causing bad weather.

It shouldn’t matter that it looks good on her, or that she is going to be laughed at, dressing in colorless, bland clothes and without a wireless bra, but that is the price she has to pay for the benefit of The Climate.

Cotton is out of the question, as it comes from distant lands and pesticides are used for it. Very bad for the environment.

 We just saw on her Instagram that she’s pretty angry with us. This was not our intention.

From now on, at 7 p.m. we will turn off the WiFi and we will only switch it on again the next day after dinner for two hours. In this way we will save on electricity, so she is not bothered by electro-stress and will be totally isolated from the outside world. This way, she can concentrate solely on her homework. At eleven o’clock in the evening we will pull the breaker to shut the power off to her room, so she knows that dark is really dark. That will save a lot of CO2.

She will no longer be participating in winter sports to ski lodges and resorts, nor will she be going on anymore vacations with us, because our vacation destinations are practically inaccessible by bicycle.

Since our daughter fully agrees with the girl on TV that the CO2 emissions and footprints of her great-grandparents are to blame for ‘killing our planet’, what all this simply means, is that she also has to live like her great-grandparents and they never had a holiday, a car or even a bicycle.

We haven’t talked about the carbon footprint of food yet.

Zero CO2 footprint means no meat, no fish and no poultry, but also no meat substitutes that are based on soy (after all, that grows in farmers fields, that use machinery to harvest the beans, trucks to transport to the processing plants, where more energy is used, then trucked to the packaging/canning plants, and trucked once again to the stores) and also no imported food, because that has a negative ecological effect. And absolutely no chocolate from Africa, no coffee from South America and no tea from Asia.

Only homegrown potatoes, vegetables and fruit that have been grown in local cold soil, because greenhouses run on boilers, piped in CO2 and artificial light. Apparently, these things are also bad for The Climate. We will teach her how to grow her own food.

Bread is still possible, but butter, milk, cheese and yogurt, cottage cheese and cream come from cows and they emit CO2. No more margarine and no oils will be used for the frying pan, because that fat is palm oil from plantations in Borneo where rain forests first grew.

No ice cream in the summer. No soft drinks and no energy drinks, as the bubbles are CO2.

We will also ban all plastic, because it comes from chemical factories. Everything made of steel and aluminum must also be removed. Have you ever seen the amount of energy a blast furnace consumes or an aluminum smelter? All bad for the climate!

We will replace her memory foam pillow top mattress, with a jute bag filled with straw, with a horse hair pillow.

And finally, she will no longer be using makeup, soap, shampoo, cream, lotion, conditioner, toothpaste and medication. Facewashers will all be linen, that she can wash by hand, with her wooden washboard, just like her female ancestors did before climate change made her angry at us for destroying her future.

In this way we will help her to do her part to prevent mass extinction, water levels rising and the disappearance of entire ecosystems.

If she truly believes she wants to walk the talk of the girl on TV, she will gladly accept and happily embrace her new way of life.

Sghaier’s father once grew olive and fruit trees — varieties that mostly shriveled and died under her watch. “There hasn’t been enough rain in recent years,” says the 52-year-old farmer.

Her tiny farm in eastern Tunisia is a bellwether for the dramatic environmental changes already reshaping North Africa, which threaten to intensify with climate change.

Sandwiched between an encroaching Sahara and a warming Mediterranean Sea, the region has seen a sharp drop in rainfall over the past half century—a trend experts say will likely intensify in the coming decades. Indeed, over the course of this century parts of North Africa as well as the Middle East might become uninhabitable, according to the German research and policy organization, the Max Planck Institute.

“We’re seeing higher temperatures and increasing water stress,” says Essia Guezzi, climate and energy project officer for conservation group WWF North Africa, summing up some of the regional challenges. Meanwhile, rising sea levels threaten the region’s largely coastal populations, she and others note.

These and other issues will come into sharp focus during next month’s climate summit in Spain, a fellow member of the Mediterranean region that is considered a climate hotspot—more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than other parts of the world.



 While Morocco has earned praise as a climate-change leader, the North African region overall needs to do much more to counter an otherwise grim future, experts say. Also hampering efforts: some countries are buffeted by conflict and civil unrest, while fossil fuels continue to drive Algerian and Libyan economies.

In Tunisia, fresh groundwater reserves are shrinking rapidly. Roughly two-thirds of the land is threatened by desertification. The effects of climate change are likely to slow the country’s growth, hitting two major revenue drivers—tourism and agriculture—according to a 2018 report by the Netherlands Foreign Ministry.

While Tunisian authorities have outlined ambitious targets — including cutting emissions 41 percent by 2030 compared to 2010 levels—they have been slow to match words with action, critics say. Nor did the issue figure high on candidates’ priorities in recent legislative and presidential elections.

“It seems like the environment and the impact of climate change is the last concern of many Tunisian politicians,” says Hamadi Gharbi, WWF North Africa Climate and Energy project manager, who says the country also needs more climate financing and expertise.

In the village of Bir Salah, Sghaier is trying, at least locally, to turn the tide. She and other area farmers began planting hardy acacia trees to help reduce erosion, along with moringa, a fast-growing plant prized for its nutritional and medicinal properties.

The idea was to help fight climate change and earn a profit doing so. The reality has not been so easy.

“Everyone likes new products,” Sghaier says, showing a visitor her storeroom packed with moringa oils and powders, along with bags of moringa-based bsissa, a Tunisian breakfast drink, which a group of growers have made and packaged.

“The problem is selling them,” she says. “It’s hard to find a market.”

Across the Sahara, the African Union has spearheaded an ambitious ‘Great Green Wall’ initiative aimed to restore degraded land across a swathe of the Sahel, while also offering income-generating opportunities for communities living there.

“The goal is to replant trees, to return the Sahel to what it was about 60 years ago, when there was a lot more forest cover,” says anthropologist Gilles Boetsch, director of a French scientific team working with Senegalese researchers in the region.

There are plenty of setbacks he says. Many trees die and need to be replaced, while conflict in some Sahel countries makes areas inaccessible.

“It doesn’t work 100 percent, but it works,” Boetsch says, adding a similar regional initiative could also work north of the Sahara. “The first problem is water. The second is getting communities to accept the projects.”

In North Africa, some national projects to fight climate change are making a difference, and Tunisia will reportedly present a regional oases protection project at the Madrid climate conference.

Local farmers in northern Algeria are getting Mexican expertise to plant prickly pear, a cactus that offers a raft of nutritional and money-generating benefits and needs little rainfall. Algeria is also trying to revive a massive ‘Green Dam’ reforestation project that previously had disappointing results.

In Tunisia’s southeastern Gabes region, Dhafer Guezguez worked with the local government in European Union-financed projects that included restoring oases and reintroduce native date palm species. The plants are hardy and nutritious, he says, but not as sweet as popular commercial varieties. Attracting consumers will need serious marketing.

“They need to be showcased as a product that’s rare and good for you,” Guezguez says. “The same kind of effort we saw in Europe and the United States to get people to eat organic products.”

The oases preservation initiatives have helped to boost local economies and restore depleted soil, he says. Women dominate the workforce. The projects have continued even after EU financing ended. Participants are also making tourist handicrafts like palm leaf bags and hats, to earn extra revenue.

“I think this is how, little by little, we can save the oases,” Guezguez says. “When local communities realize it’s in their interest to do so.",mainstream,M0ce84,climate.change
32,1319,"Here we see swaddling clothes for the baby - and a shroud for the mother. Here we see a baby's cradle connected tragically with a woman's coffin. Here we hear a birth cry and a death gurgle at one and the same time.

The dying mother's last act was to name her child. ""And she named the child Ichabod."" And her last testimony was - as she thought upon the ark of God being taken by the Philistines - ""The glory is departed from Israel.

""It was goodbye to glory!""

Let us make some applications of that statement, even though we may appear as those who carve epitaphs on tombstones, or as those who write obituaries, or as those who wailingly and discordantly participate in funeral dirges. Though we may be asking you to look through old windows upon scenes which others have described, though we may travel some well-worn and familiar trails, though we may serve the same food in somewhat different platters, still we make bold to ask you to remember that 'tis true'.

A Nation May Lose Its Glory

The wife of Phinehas, passing through the swirling waters of the river of death, said: ""The glory is departed from Israel ""Thoughtfully scanning the pages of history, rubbing the dust of centuries off the tombs of some nations that underwent the frightful processes of self-burial, we can give the same testimonies concerning other nations. For 'tis true that, warmed by the sun which never loses its glory, a nation's sun may set in night. Under the stars - stars which never lose their splendor a nation's starry crown may lose its brightness, being displaced by a withered wreath of poison ivy or a circle of undesirable cactus, or by the brow becoming an eyeless, earless, tongueless, brainless skull.

Beneath the heavens which declare the glory of God, even as the firmament showeth His handiwork, a nation that circled the clouds as a strong-winged eagle, can flutter among the clouds as a broken- winged vulture or squawking parrot. Among the flowery continents of God a nation can become a place of foul odours that make the righteous stop their noses.

[Ancient Babylon] Great was the glory of Babylon of old; but Babylon became a vermin-infested, animal-prowling jungle - Babylon, ""the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency,"" became ""as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah."" Something of the tragic departure of its glory is told in these words:

""It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall he full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there. And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.""- Isaiah 13:20-22.

[Ancient Carthage] Great was the glory of Carthage centuries ago. But her commanders became as impotent as skeletons of cattle scattered on desert sands. Her swift feet became as a cripple's walk - her clenched fist as the fumbling fingers of a paralytic.

[Ancient Syria] Wondrous the glory of Syria at a time when Eleanor's troubadours at Antioch bewitched the Syrian air with ballads of the South - and lightened the horrors of the second crusade. But Syria's glory departed when the following was said. ""But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; They are revolted and gone.""- Jeremiah 5:23.

[Ancient Greece] Great was the glory of ancient Greece - especially from 450 B.C. to 350 B.C. - under Pericles. But Greece became a moulded crust in history's garbage heap. Greece had her Athens -- civilization's queen. Plato was hers. Socrates was hers. A vast multitude of seers was hers. Phidias, raising beautiful children unto Athens from the sterile womb of stone, marbled many places with sculptured wonders. The Muses tented in her gates and plumed the arts with eagle's wings. At many shrines the human brain bowed in reverence. But with all these persons, with all these things of beauty, Greece became a moulded crust in history's garbage can.

[Ancient Rome] Great the glory of the Rome of centuries far back and forever gone - especially from 50 B.C. to 60 A.D. - with her astute statesmen, with her close-meshed code of laws, with her sword-woven mantle, coin- embroidered, that fell on cities where merchants congregated and fattened on the spoils of trade, with her armies that feasted and fattened on blood.

Rome was mighty among the kingdoms - mighty wherever ships and swords and thrones and lust of gold and sovereignty constituted the boasted heritage of the age. But Rome and her glory became as a mouth full of pyorrheic gums holding rotten teeth, all loose and foul.

[Ancient Nineveh] Great the glory of the nation-like realm of Nineveh - with her winged lions symbolic of strength and speed. But Nineveh became as a vari-colored butterfly enmeshed and perishing in the net of a relentless spider.

[Ancient Egypt] Great the glory of old ancient Egypt - the land of the Pharaohs -the land of wealth and wonders. But it became a shabby sexton of splendid tombs - her torch of far-reaching splendor became a pot of smoke without one spark of remaining radiance.

[Ancient Spain] Great was the glory of ancient Spain - back there in the glorious years beyond recall. Wide and strong was the sway of her scepter. Her piratical ships harassed all the seas and filled her coffers with gold. But this nation, with climate and conquests and caches of coin, with thrones and crowns and scepters, with laughter and love and lure, with men and money and might, with fervor and force and fruit, became as a drowsy and lousy and frowsy beggar watching a broken clock.

[Ancient Jerusalem] And let us ask you to think of Jerusalem - ""beautiful for situation ""- as representative of the nation Israel. Triumphant were her temples. Her past ""shines glorious as doth the moon on midnight seas."" For favoured Jerusalem, kings kneeled down and prayed. For glorious Jerusalem, prophets, in tears and love, served. For beautiful Jerusalem, martyrs shriveled into flame. In Jerusalem's virgin face were eyes in which, deep-folded, lay prophecies of the Son of God.

But because within her sacred courts evil was girt with diadem, Jerusalem hardened her heart. Jerusalem bloodied her hands. Jerusalem deafened her ears. Jerusalem played the harlot. And Jesus described her then departing and afterward utterly departed glory in these words, ""Thy house is left unto thee desolate.""

Covered this blood-soaked earth with the wreck of once-glorious cities. Scarred the face of this war-blighted earth with the ruin of once-glorious nations. Marred the fair face of this world with the wreck of once-glorious civilizations - civilizations which have left behind them nothing but the smoke of the brilliant torch, nothing more than an empty name, nothing more than the shadow of a shadow.

What the Bible says about some nations and some cities - representatives in large measure of once- proud, once-strong, once-influential civilizations - is true of other nations and cities of the past and the present:

""For I have sworn by myself, saith the Lord, That Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes...

""Also Edom shall be a desolation. every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof...

""And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever; there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it. ""- Jeremiah 49:13,17,33.

""This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, That said in her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one That passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.""- Zephaniah 2:15.

In America we must remember that the glory of a nation is righteousness and faith in God - and going the way God points - and in such is our security against all foes, our immunity against the ravages of time.

""For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish, yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.""- Isaiah 60:12. This sober truth that only righteousness exalteth a nation -- that if ever America loses her faith in God she will have to come off her pedestal, that pallbearers that carried other nations to their graves will do work for us if we forsake God and refuse to go the way He points -- was put upon our hearts once by the editor of the Watchman-Examiner in these words:

""We should remember that one hundred years ago Germany was regarded as the most Christian nation in Europe. Germany's evangelicalism was once so pronounced that Martin Luther gave us the marvelous translation of the Scriptures and directed the world to the Bible. The Scriptures so influenced the Home, the School, and the Church of Germany that the national life saw a phenomenal progress. Germany was now making terrific strides in science, art, and culture. Then came a day when innate conceit got to work. Christianity was emasculated. Christ was rationalized to be nothing more than a good man. The Holy Scriptures were reduced to a crazy quilt. Religion came to be built on negatives. God was dwarfed and man was deified. 'Let the strong survive,' became the new religion. Germany was decivilized and Hitler had no trouble getting his followers to arm to the hilt to conquer the world.""

Let us ask the help of Almighty God in these days when men ""loose wild tongues that hold not God in awe,"" when there are evils that would lead our greatest graces to the grave and leave the world no copy. When the atheistic deformities of our times would coerce us into substituting for Christianity's vital bread a chunk of froth scattered by miasmatic winds - lest our country become a despised Ichabod among the nations of earth.

A Church May Lose Her Glory

""Thy glory hath departed ""Too bad and too sad when that is spoken of a church about which glorious things once were spoken. 'Tis tragic, 'tis true that of some churches such is the epitaphic description of their decay, their inverted torch, their oil-less lamps, their turning back in the day of battle - though armed and carrying bows. That is grief for angels. That is laughter for devils. That is gloating for Satan. That is groaning for Christ's followers.

A church can ""leave its first love ""The church at Ephesus did - and needed to ""repent and do the first works ""Revelation 2:4,5. A church can change from an army into an ecclesiastical nursery wherein the preacher is looked upon as a head nurse who has more to do with milk bottles for sickly saints than with mighty battles against seductive Satan. Then does its glory depart.

A church can change from a church of compassionate concern into a church of callisthenic conventionality utterly devoid of devotional vitality - censorious of spiritual and far-sighted leadership, worldly, wayward, and peevishly puny. Then can Ichabod be written over its portals, its pews, its pulpit.

A church can change from a cataract of activity into a scum-covered pond of stagnation.

Thus, forgetting that ""she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth,"" she hastens the departure of her glory.

A church can change from a church of aggressive conquest into a church possessive of a slothful timidity, a passive acquiescence in small attainments, a criminal spineless in the face of evils that arrogantly challenge, a careless in- difference to great stretches of the unattained.

Thus is Ichabod an appropriate adjective for its activities and aimlessness. A church can be a roller of marbles when it should be a remover of mountains. Thus does its spiritual muscle become flabby, its fingers fumbling, its feet halt - as the glory departs.

A church can put its headlight on the rear and think only of the glory that was. Then and thus does its light grow dim, its voice faltering, its spiritual ambitions anemic, its worship boresomely lacking in life, its glory one of the past. Pathetic the words that fell from the Master's lips. ""And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!

And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? There shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down"" Mark 13:1,2. They were great buildings. They were magnificent stones. But to his eyes they were nothing more than ruins, for the glory of the temple's worship and service had departed.

""But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart""- I Sam. 16:7.

Outwardly that beautiful and stately temple seemed destined to ""defy the tooth of time."" Inwardly it was hollow and empty and tottering to its fall. Write ""Ichabod"" upon it.

Is it possible for a church, when God calls it to ""launch out into the deep ""in the matter of soul-winning, to become ""a drifting sepulcher manned by a frozen crew?""

Well, when academic luster takes the place of spiritual passion, when refrigeration is valued above conflagration, such is the danger.

I once heard Dr. Perry Webb say: ""The atmosphere in some churches is so cold, you can skate down the aisles.""

Is it true that a church may be noted for the gorgeous architecture of its building, the lovely music of its choir, the stateliness of its ritual, the fine-functioning of all its organizations, the largeness of numbers as to its congregation, the influence in many circles of business and social and educational life - and yet be, in the eyes of Him who marks the sparrow's fall, as a corpse wrapped in an ornate shroud?

Of the church at Sardis, Jesus, risen and enthroned, said: ""And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write, These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.""- Revelation 3:1.

Somebody described another church like unto the church at Sardis in these words:

Outwardly splendid as of old -

Inwardly sparkless, void and cold - 

Her force and fire all spent and gone - 

Like the dead moon she still shines on.

R.T. Ketcham once said: 

""Attend church, but do not attend a church which prefers science to Scripture, reason for revelation, theories for truth, culture for conversion, benevolence for blood, goodness for grace, sociability for spirituality, play for praise, pep for prayer, profession for possession, progress for power, reformation for regeneration, good for God, speculation for salvation, jubilation for justification, feelings for faith, paralysis for peace, politics for precepts.""

To this I make additional comment saying that a church deserves to have Ichabod written from its lowest cellar step to the sky-touching point of its steeple which prefers the adulation of saints to ardent anxieties concerning lost sinners as well as abhorrence of that which is evil.

Glory yields up its scepter - when the fancies of literary notables have place along with the facts of the gospel, when there is the frivolity of the flesh instead of the fervor of the spiritual in serving the Lord - godliness in form only instead of glorying in the cross of Christ - a groping after eternal verities - and a guessing that only borders on godliness as to the certainties of God's promises instead of a guidance of others into paths of righteousness.

Glory ""packs its baggage for a one-way trip"" when in the church people are noted for faultfinding instead of being notable for forgiveness - when offense is quickly taken and there is overlordism instead of the offering of self for lowly service - when the making of money means more than the mastery of money.

How can the glory of the church be as a sunlit mountain whose position never changes when in the church there is playing at the job and little praying on the job - when peevishness and petulance predominate over praise - when there is quarrelsomeness instead of quietness - when there is frequent rumpus-raising and riotous revelry instead of restfulness, sinfulness instead of saintliness, selfishness instead of service, tattling instead of testimony, tampering with temptation instead of triumph over temptation.

""Thy glory hath departed ""will be written on earth and known in Heaven of the church where there is more yawning over watches than yearning over wanderers-where there is mere zest and not zealousness in good works. Let us so live and give, so love and serve, so watch and pray, that, if the individual's conduct were universalized, it would never be as a hand that writes of a church, ""Thy glory hath departed.""

The true glory of a church consists: ""in the purity of its members; in its spiritual progress; in the unity of its fellowship; in the spiritual children born into its household of faith; in its self-sacrificing spirit toward others; and in the prayer life of the whole group. When a church is in a healthy condition hypocrisy will be limited; progress in purity will be constant; strife and discord will disappear; sympathy for the lost will seek means for their rescue; recruits will outnumber the losses from backsliding, removal, and death; private devotion will be a pleasure, family religion a joy, and public worship a sought delight.""

Along with this let us remember that any church will undergo the frightful processes of dishonorable self- burial where there is a lax theology that advocates a mutilated Bible, a minimized sin, a deified man, a humanized Christ-substituting human opinions and speculations for the revealed pronouncements of God concerning the Bible, concerning the nature of men, concerning the terrors of sin, concerning the deity of Christ, concerning the meaning of Christ's death on the cross, concerning the plan of salvation, concerning Hell, concerning Heaven.

A Home May Lose Its Glory

Yet, glorious as the glory of a real home is, the glory can depart - sometimes does depart - assuredly will depart - if the things ""down under"" Christian ideals, sordidly below Christian standards for a home - get the upper hand and put their oppressive heels upon the virtues which would weave wedding garments instead of shrouds on the home loom.

Answer these questions: Are there not many homes that are polluted reservoirs from which muddy streams that carry deadly contamination flow? Are there not many homes that are grindstones on which the Devil sharpens his weapons of wickedness?

The glory of a home departs when parents walk on the edges of mental abysses - talking nonsense. The glory of a home will assuredly leave a home as a flower wilts under heavy frost - when parents, by neglect or omission in spiritual matters, send children out to sea in paper boats, as though seas did not drown, - when parents, in matters momentous as to issue in stainlessness of morals, permit children, in daring defiance of Christian conduct, to walk bare-footed on live coals, as though fire did not burn.

Today so many homes die in houses. Today many who know better, living for things that matter least, neglecting things that matter most, are content with houses in which there are no homes.

In pioneer days, wolves often attacked children. In remote mountain districts eagles did the same. Out West Indians attempted to destroy the home of settlers. On battlefields vultures have eaten the sons of women. Now vultures of evil literature attack our children. Now poisonous serpents are in every pathway they tread. Now the jackals of sex familiarity are fed by precept and example. Now the leaping leopards of lust; Now the vultures of infidelity in ministry and press; Now barnyard morality; Now demagogues who ravage the land; Now the buzzards of liquor traffic on every corner - permitted there by the United States Government; Now the theory of evolution in most schools - evolution, the antithesis of Christianity; Now modernism choosing the livery of Heaven to serve the Devil in; Now godless scholarship summoning the Bible to appear at the bar of human reason; Now all these infest our land.

All of which is to say that - no explorer amid the wilds of the North, no adventurer amid unexplored jungles, no doctor amid deadly contagions of disease - ever had to face as many dangers as our children of today face: their morals, their spiritual welfare, their mental wealth, their soul's salvation considered.

Parental delinquency makes glory depart from a home. Are we unfair to say that behind every delinquent child is a delinquent parent? Are we ceasing to tell the truth when we say that behind every broken youth is a broken home? Do we not speak words of truth when we say that behind every broken home is a neglect of God in that home?

When a fifteen-year-old unmarried girl, pregnant with child, stands before the court and states that she does not consider she has done wrong - no more than thousands of other young girls are doing - where are the mothers?

When a fourteen-year-old boy, apprehended for roaming the streets of a city at early morning hours, stands before the court with tears in his eyes and asks to be sent to the state school - because he knows he would be happier there than in his own home - where is the father?

When young girls smoke a pack of cigarettes a day and dress so skimpily they attract the attention of every goggle-eyed man and boy - do not their mothers the same?

When boys argue over the relative ""values"" and ""quick-stirring"" powers of advertised brands of liquor - do not their fathers drink booze and vote for legalizing it, forgetting that you can control a powder can in a fire as easily as you can control booze?

Is there not too much laxness on the part of parents toward spiritual values? Often children are allowed to stay out of Sunday School and to miss church services - to remain in almost complete ignorance of the spiritual values. Is it not perilous to children, this easy-come, easy-go attitude of parents? Is not the use of intoxicating beverages one of the greatest evils responsible for juvenile delinquency?

Are not children from homes where indiscriminate drinking is done sent out to ""play the game"" with two strikes against them? Do not thinking people believe that youth delinquency would be negligible if it were not for delinquent adults, especially delinquent parents? Can one pass judgment on these young people without indictment of ourselves for failure somewhere down the line?

Do not boys and girls get into trouble when too much leisure time is theirs?

Are not city governments extremely unwise to say they have no money for further improvement of playgrounds while they allot large sums of taxpayers' money for the cost of punishing the youth for committing crimes?

Is it not shortsightedness bordering on imbecility to pay so much for the cost of juvenile delinquency and so little for its prevention?

""Any law should be so framed to penalize the delinquent parent as well as the delinquent child . . . We must first give God his rightful place in the American home ... Until the cardinal principles of God are implanted in the hearts of the youth of our nation...until there is instilled in the hearts of the parents of these youth a God-like sense of responsibility in that home, we shall continue to experience wave upon wave of crime, mounting and growing steadily day by day, until it reaches a magnitude beyond the scope of the law-enforcement agencies and the American people to control.""

But if parents distinguish themselves by the profession of truth, the worship of God, the practice of virtue, they will be sure to draw others after them; whereas if they are irreligious and un-Christian, they are infested fountains that poison. Parents can no more dispense with personal piety without malicious influence on children than a tree can dispense with sap and bear fruit.

Adam and Eve sinned! And Cain became a murderer. Had they not sinned, Abel would have lived. If a rock is a quotation from the quarry, if a flower is a quotation from the garden, if a tree is a quotation from the forest, if a bird is a quotation from the flock, if every child is a quotation of his parents - what sort do the children make you?

Today the situation is desperate. Character is at a premium in the land. Criminality of all kinds is rampant. The daily prints are filled with record of deeds almost too revolting for public consumption.

An ever-rising wave of lawlessness is hurling its weight against the bulwarks of the nation. Much of this is because of godless homes-because too many fathers and mothers have abdicated.

How parents ought to rejoice for the opportunity of living close to God, of hearing the motion of angel's wings in the patter of little children, and of being Christlike in the home.

Glory in a home is made secure when Christian conduct is evident. Unless you serve God yourselves as parents you will plant vines on which will grow grapes of bitterness. ""What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge? ""Ezekiel 18:2

Nothing is so infectious as example: ""We can do more good by being good than in any other way ""(Kingsley). ""A father who whipped his son for swearing and swore while he whipped him, did more harm by his example than good by his correction ""(Fuller). ""Noble examples stir us up to noble actions""(Burke). ""Live with wolves and you will learn to howl.""

A drinking or drunken father is a poor preacher of sobriety to sons. A proud father is a miserable recommender of humility to sons. They will do as you do rather than as you say. Your example will counteract all the effect of your counsel - and all the convictions you would fix in the mind will fall like arrows from an impenetrable shield. You should therefore begin ""both to do and to teach.""

You should be able, in a humble measure, at least, to say to those under your care: ""Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ..."" ""Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? Thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? Thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?"" Romans 2:21-23

If parents suffered their children to go naked, to beg their bread, to lie unattended in sickness, to perish with hunger in a ditch, they would be shunned as monsters. But parents act a far more criminal and a far more infamous part by disregarding their spiritual and everlasting welfare.

Doubtless Herod, after killing the infants in Bethlehem, was viewed and shunned with horror. But he was far less cruel than some modern parents. He only destroyed the body.

""But it any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, be hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel. ""I Timothy 5:8.

Let us remember and teach others to remember - lest glory depart from our dwellings - that there is a difference in a house and a home: that a house is built by human hands but a home is built by human hearts, that a house is built of visible materials but a home is built of the invisible things of the Spirit; that a house may be destroyed, but fire and flood and earthquake and storm can not destroy a real home; that there is only one calamity can ruin a home, the death of love; that the real food of a home is not meat and bread but thoughtfulness and unselfishness.

The basis for Christianity in the home, the preventative of departed glory, is Jesus and the church.

Can there be a real Christian home without union with the church?

Can there be Christian homes without churchgoing as a habit as well as a duty and a privilege?

Jesus had the habit of churchgoing, for 'tis written: ""He was in the synagogue as was his custom on the Sabbath day.""

When I was a boy it was as natural to go to church on Sunday as it was to work on Monday or to play games on Saturday afternoon, but the present idea is that it is a terrible thing, a species of mental and physical punishment.

Dr. Macartney tells how when Grover Cleveland lay dying at Princeton, his mind reverted, not to any of the fierce political battles through which he had passed, nor to the presidential honors and burdens which he had borne, but to the old home in the Presbyterian manse, where his minister father at family worship prayed for the eternal salvation of his children.

The dying man asked that a copy of the hymnbook out of which they used to sing be procured, so that with its music and its memories he might face the eternal world. And then this great preacher says:

""All kinds of doctors are abroad today with all kinds of remedies for our national and social diseases. But a filled family pew in God's house on the Lord's day is the best thing that can ever happen to a family, a city, or a nation.""

An Individual May Lose the Glory

It is possible for an individual so to live that it can be said in earth and declared in Heaven: ""Thy glory has departed ""- as light departs from a lamp in which there is no oil, as fruitfulness departs from a tree wherein is no sap.

The old poet must have had some experience of this truth when he wrote:

I remember, I remember, 

But now 'tis little joy 

To know I'm farther off from Heaven 

Than when I was a boy.

What tragedy when ""Ichabod""- ""Thy glory hath departed ""- is written above and over a once- believing heart! What sorrow sufficient to make angels weep - when ""thy-glory-hath-departed ""is the autobiography of a life once faithful, once loyal, once devoted. What cause for grief when the life once a life of unselfish service becomes a life of stagnant selfishness - a life that centers in self. What tragedy for earth and man and God when the life once possessed of the fruit of the Spirit - ""love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, meekness, goodness, faith, self-control ""- is now a life in which is manifest the works of the flesh - ""adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envying, murders, drunkenness, reveling, and such like.""

Yet that you see, that you find, in the lives of some individuals who have gone from us - and in the lives of some who now live in our midst. So many who call themselves Christians have lost the old-time glow. With them the sacred fervor of other years is lacking.

Men and women there are who once believed in prayer and believed that we forfeit peace and bear needless pain because we do not carry everything to God in prayer; but now they are prayerless altogether or are weak in prayer and look upon it as a useless exercise.

People I know who, when they were young, believed the Bible to be the Word of God - infinite in scope, infallible in authority, regenerative in power, personal in application - who now say that it is a book of myths and allegories. Of them 'tis tragically true they have hewn themselves cisterns where no water is and have forsaken the fountain of living waters.

I know young people who have attended schools that once, in the days of our forefathers, were bulwarks for the most holy faith. Entering these schools they were believers in the miraculous and the supernatural, but now, deceived by the evil seducers who wooed and won them with strange and fantastic myths, they are adrift - without chart or compass.

From them the glory hath departed, even as it had departed from schools which serve the Devil in the livery of Heaven. Instead of believing the certainties of God's Word, they put their trust in the unscriptural surmises of men. Instead of feeding on God's Word, they have grown lean on the diet of quips given them by those who, calling themselves scholarly teachers, plant ""probabilities ""and ""perhapses"" and ""maybes"" or ""not-at-alls"" in the minds of youth.

Thus has glory departed from the teachers and from the taught. Thus has glory departed from the schools in which these teachers teach. The students so taught and the teachers who, like vandals, break into the house of their faith should realize that man's wisdom is to be laughed at.

How glory departs from an individual, or a multitude of individuals when they depart from the teaching of the supernaturalistic school, championed by orthodox Christians contending that Christ is the God-man - to line up with the materialistic school, championed by evolutionists.

Think of Judas - the incarnation of infamy today! Shakespeare called him ""the base Judean who sold a pearl richer than all his tribe."" Judas, given a great opportunity by Christ Himself, had part of ""the ministry and apostleship on which angels longed to serve."" Did not this position place its participant on a level with Moses and Elijah?

But the glory of this individual began to grow dim when he began to wonder about the course that Jesus chose in refusing the kingship and in antagonizing the rulers. The glory grew even dimmer when he began to worry about the future - and dimmer still when he began to pilfer the bag. And his glory departed completely when he went out into the night to bargain to betray Jesus for the price of a hog! Truly over it all you can write: ""Thy glory hath departed.""

And think of Lot - called just and righteous. ""And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked (for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day, with their unlawful deeds.) ""He was driven to Egypt when famine came, yet his soul in many ways became a famished soul. A businessman, an opportunist, maker of a bad choice that he thought was a good choice. He certainly added no brightness to manhood's torch by marrying a woman of Sodom - the wickedest city mentioned in man's literature, hopelessly corrupt. Lot escaped with only his family when God burned Sodom to the ground. Lot's last act was one of incest. From his daughters came the nations of Ammon and Moab.

And think of Saul - first king of Israel. His glory, which was as a burning bush of splendor, faded into lusterless cold ashes. Let us see what the Scriptures tell us: ""And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons. And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers. Then said Saul unto his Armour bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and abuse me. But his Armour bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it ""I Samuel 31:2-4.

Again and again, with tragic repetition, do the pages of history testify that individuals who once gave light as steady stars came to the time and place where their light was the flame of a fluttering candle. In our churches we see people who once served faithfully who proved their kinship with Demas - to the hurt of some and to the sorrow of many. In some homes we have those who once held as sacred the marital vow who have gone as wild as the winds which know no barriers in making these vows perjury. 'Tis true that many know not, or, if knowing, give no heed to the truth that to leave Jesus out of life is to say good-by to glory. Against all things and against all evils that bring people to the place and time where they say good-by to glory,

I would that all men would take an unwavering stand remembering God's promise:

""And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee."" Jeremiah 1:19

1,921,"Despite concerns by some parents that their children receive “too many vaccines too soon,” a new study finds that many shots, even on the same day, do not increase the risk of autism.

In the first six months of life, children receive as many as 19 vaccine doses of six different vaccines, and by the time they are 6 years old, a total of 25 doses from 10 vaccines.

MORE FROM MY HEALTH NEWS DAILY:
• Beyond Vaccines: 5 Things that Might Really Cause Autism
• 10 Medical Myths that Just Won't Go Away

In a 2011 survey, about a third of parents expressed concerns that their child received too many vaccines before age 2, and too many vaccines on a single day.

Previous studies have found no link between the number of vaccines a child receives and their risk of several neurological conditions (though these studies did not specifically consider autism).

The new study went a step further by looking at the link between a child's total exposure to antigens — the proteins in vaccines that stimulate the body's immune system — and his or her risk of autism.

The researchers looked at total antigen exposure rather than the total number of vaccines kids received because, at the root of parents' concerns is the idea that ""somehow they provide too much immunological stimulation, more so than a young child's immune system can handle,"" said study researcher Dr. Frank DeStefano, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (The sheer number of vaccines would not be as good a measure of immunological response because vaccines contain different numbers of antigens, and some protect against more than one disease, DeStefano said.)

DeStefano and colleagues analyzed information from about 250 children with autism and 750 children without autism, born between 1994 and 1999.

Children with autism were exposed to about same total number of antigens as children without autism at ages 3 months, 7 months and 2 years. There was also no difference between the two groups in terms of the total number of antigens they were exposed to on a single day.

""Parental concerns that their children are receiving too many vaccines in the first two years of life, or too many vaccines at a single doctor visit are not supported in terms of an increased risk of autism,"" the researchers write in the March 29 issue of the Journal of Pediatrics.

Kids are exposed to many viruses and other pathogens that stimulate their immune systems in the same way vaccines do, and it's been estimated that kids could theoretically receive thousands of vaccines at once, the researchers said.

Although children today receive more vaccines than children in the mid-90s, the vaccines used today contain fewer antigens. So while children in the mid-90s were exposed to between 3,000 and 15,250 antigens in the first two years of life, children today are exposed to about 315 antigens, the researchers said.

2,534,"On April 30, the nation reported just four cases, all of them travellers arriving from abroad, marking the first day with zero local infections in two and a half months. As case numbers have continued to fall, the government has cautiously relaxed its guidelines, while signaling a shift to ""everyday quarantine"" measures, such as wearing masks and temperature checks at schools.

People's attitudes have also relaxed, leading some officials to worry about complacency and a second wave of infections. The nightclub outbreak may heighten those fears, but the government has already responded aggressively, tracing and testing thousands of people in a matter of days.

Last mile is the toughest

Though testing companies were quick to respond to the demand, rolling out the kits presented difficulties. Through February, demand for tests was still outpacing supply, and there were only enough kits to distribute to a select number of hospitals.

Furthermore, hospitals struggled to administer the tests to potentially contagious patients safely and quickly—testing areas needed to be sanitised after each patient, long queues meant the virus could spread while people waited in line, and health workers were running low on protective gear. At Yangji Hospital, this also led to exhausted staff, says hospital director Sang Il Kim.

""Even when we did have kits, the waiting times were just too long for everybody to get tested, so they would have to go to other hospitals,"" adds Yoona Chung, a doctor in the hospital's surgery department.

According to Yangji's data, the hospital was conducting roughly 10 tests a day by late February—but many more were being turned away due to the wait. Other hospitals in Korea started experimenting with drive-through testing centres, where patients could get tested without leaving their cars. But Yangji Hospital is near a subway station in a crowded neighbourhood in southern Seoul; for many of its patients, cars aren't an option.

So, Kim devised the walk-in booths, which went into pilot operation on March 10. Within days, the number of tests administered in a day had tripled. By the end of the month, the hospital could handle more than 90 patients a day. Hospitals elsewhere in Korea and around the world quickly adopted their own variations on the concept. A hospital in Busan had a similar idea independently but others have had help from Kim.",mainstream,M08f39,cancer; coronavirus; covid.19; drug.companies; population.control; vaccine.covid
3,538,"The FBI disproved its main theory about how the anthrax spores were weaponized.

The investigation of the 2001 anthrax attacks ended as far as the public knew on July 29, 2008, with the death of Bruce Ivins, a senior biodefense researcher at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in Fort Detrick, Md. The cause of death was an overdose of the painkiller Tylenol. No autopsy was performed, and there was no suicide note.

Less than a week after his apparent suicide, the FBI declared Ivins to have been the sole perpetrator of the 2001 Anthrax attacks, and the person who mailed deadly anthrax spores to NBC, the New York Post, and Sens. Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy. These attacks killed five people, closed down a Senate office building, caused a national panic, and nearly paralyzed the postal system.

The FBI’s six-year investigation was the largest inquest in its history, involving 9,000 interviews, 6,000 subpoenas, and the examination of tens of thousands of photocopiers, typewriters, computers and mailboxes. Yet it failed to find a shred of evidence that identified the anthrax killer–or even a witness to the mailings. With the help of a task force of scientists, it found a flask of anthrax that closely matched–through its genetic markers–the anthrax used in the attack.

This flask had been in the custody of Ivins, who had published no fewer than 44 scientific papers over three decades as a microbiologist and who was working on developing vaccines against anthrax. As custodian, he provided samples of it to other scientists at Fort Detrick, the Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, and other facilities involved in anthrax research.

According to the FBI’s reckoning, over 100 scientists had been given access to it. Any of these scientists (or their co-workers) could have stolen a minute quantity of this anthrax and, by mixing it into a media of water and nutrients, used it to grow enough spores to launch the anthrax attacks.",conspiracy,C0086a,vaccine
4,192,"A shot in the dark? Some say flu vaccine hard to find

Some parts of the country are experiencing spot shortages of flu vaccine because of increased demand in a flu season that started earlier and is more severe than previous years.

In Las Vegas, Celeste Tom tried six times before she found a flu shot for her boyfriend.

""I'd been bugging him to get a flu shot, but he kept putting it off,"" said Tom, 55. The Smith's Food and Drug Center where she got her shot was out. Her partner called his doctor's office, but they were out, too. Next she tried a Walgreens and then a CVS pharmacy; no vaccine. She called another Smith's, but it would administer vaccine only to people over 65. On Monday, she found a Walgreens that had 10 doses left. ""I called back when he got off work at 1 p.m. to make sure they still had some, and he finally went in.""

""The bottom line is there's vaccine out there,"" said Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""There may be places where there are spot shortages, but there should be a little bit more coming, so people may have to check around for it.""

It took Pam Copley a full day. The Staten Island, N.Y., mom, 42, tried her pediatrician, but the office had no appointments until February. She and daughter Colleen, 15, got in line at a CVS, only to have the nurse come and and say she didn't have shots for anyone under 18. After ""a bunch of phone calls,"" Copley found vaccine at an urgent-care clinic. They had to wait there for five hours, but it was worth it, she said. ""There's lots of flu in the schools here right now.

U.S. flu vaccine manufacturers have increased the number of doses they expect to produce this year to 145 million from previous estimates of 137 million, Skinner said. About 128 million doses have been shipped, and the ""vast majority"" of those have been used, he said. ""We had 112 million people vaccinated by the end of November.""

The CDC is working with the National Influenza Vaccine Summit, a coalition that monitors the flu and vaccine supply, to tell doctors and other health care providers which distributors and vaccine manufacturers have vaccine available to order, Skinner said.

""Spot shortages are not due to any manufacturing issues,"" said Rita Chappelle, a spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration. It's more an effect of a mild flu season last year and a more severe one this year. ""Demand for the vaccine is high.""

Ordering flu vaccine can be a challenge, said Cameron Wolfe with the division of infectious diseases at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, N.C. It requires ""pharmacies, physicians' offices and clinics to pre-order their supply, and given the variability in the flu season, it is always an educated estimate of what you'll actually need.""

There are two main vaccine producers in the United States, Sanofi US in Bridgewater, Conn., and GlaxoSmithKline in Upper Merion, Pa. For the 2012-2013 flu season GlaxoSmithKline, also known as GSK, produced about 25 million doses of flu vaccine.

All those 25 million doses of flu vaccine are spoken for, and shipping will be finished by early to mid-February, GSK spokesman Robert Perry said.

That doesn't mean there's no more flu vaccine available to doctors. Much of GSK's production goes to medical suppliers that take orders from doctors' offices, Perry said. The company had the capacity to produce more flu shots, but 25 million doses was ""what customers told us they would need,"" Perry said. In the past two years about half of Americans get vaccinated.

It's tricky to estimate how much to produce because flu vaccine takes six to nine months to produce, so manufacturers have to plan production before all the orders are in. GSK began taking orders for this flu season in October 2011. It will finish taking orders for next year's flu season next month. Health care providers base their estimates on previous year's demand. A single dose costs $7.90 to $8.85 wholesale, and doctors are careful not to order too much.

It's still not too late to get vaccinated. Flu seasons are unpredictable in their length, and it's unclear whether cases are still building or beginning to wane, according to the CDC. ""Being vaccinated with the flu vaccine each year remains the best way to prevent the flu,"" Chappelle said.

6,427,"Jeff Bradstreet, who has been described as a “controversial autism researcher,” has now become the center of conspiracy rumors after reports of his apparent suicide. His death is said to have followed on the heels of a raid by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of his Bradstreet Wellness Center in Buford, Georgia (update 27JUN2015: the Georgia Drugs and Narcotics Agency is reported to have aided in the raid). A fisherman found Bradstreet’s body in a North Carolina river on Friday, June 19. Authorities in Rutherford County, North Carolina, state that he had a gunshot wound to the chest, “which appears to be self-inflicted,” according to the local newspaper, the Gwinnett Daily Post. The Post also reports that

That speculation has spread like a virus through the community of people who are mourning the loss of a man whom they viewed as a courageous crusader against mainstream medicine and who believe, as Bradstreet argued, that the mercury in vaccines causes autism (the evidence emphatically indicates otherwise). According to his website, Bradstreet, whose own son is autistic, embraced a number of unproven or untested interventions for autism, including using stem cells in an overseas study he chronicles, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which the FDA cracked down on in 2013. He was known for his use of chelation therapy.

As I’ve written about here before, those who are attracted to conspiracy theories to explain their world have a tendency to see conspiracy all around them. With the death of Bradstreet, this tendency is emerging in force. A related fundraiser with the title “Finding out the truth” references an “exhaustive investigation into the possibility of foul play.” At last look, the funds raised were in the low five figures. Some seem to think that the location of the wound suggests foul play, but about a fifth of suicides by gunshot involve a wound to the chest. A handgun also was found in the river where Bradstreet’s body was discovered.

Studies of people who are prone to subscribe to conspiracy theories indicate that readers drawn to conspiracy-related online news tend to be more focused on what filters into their narrow, conspiracy-oriented communities, reinforcing confirmation biases and adding fuel to the conspiratorial machine. In the US, “conspiracist beliefs,” which are widespread, correlate with being more likely to use alternative medicine and to shun mainstream medicine, even to the point of being less likely to have an annual physical. Researchers call the internet a “natural medium” for the diffusion of conspiracy theories, and the rapidity with which this one spread and took hold is no exception.",mainstream,M08c0c,vaccine.autism
7,591,"by Ashley AustrewPoliticians aren’t exactly known for being honest. President Nixon had the Watergate scandal. President Bill Clinton lied about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. And, in the first two years Donald Trump was president, the Washington Post reported he’s made over 8,000 “false or misleading claims” to the American public.

Still, it is rare to see a headline declaring any president or politician a liar. Why is that?

First of all, what does it mean to lie?

The noun and verb lie are both recorded in Old English by the 900s. To lie is “to speak falsely or utter truth knowingly, as with intent to deceive.” More generally, to lie is “to express what is false, convey a false impression.”

So, when a person lies, they aren’t just sharing false information, they’re doing it with the sinister intent of getting others to believe misleading information. If someone does this habitually, then we would call them a liar, “a person who tells lies.” This word is also attested to in the 900s.

Why don’t journalists use the word liar?

The main reason why many journalists avoid accusations of lying is because it is difficult to determine one key word in that definition above: intent.

If a lie is “a false statement that is made with deliberate intent to deceive,” then calling someone a liar means you know they are intentionally trying to mislead people. While many of us make that assumption about politicians, it’s different when you’re a member of the media tasked with reporting the news—not your own conclusions about it.

David Greenberg, a professor of history and media studies at Rutgers University and a contributing editor at Politico, wrote in 2017 that the media declaring the president a liar would cross a serious line. That’s not to say that it should never be done.

Prior to the Watergate scandal, as Greenberg observed, a National Press Club report found Nixon guilty of “an unprecedented, government-wide effort to control, restrict and conceal information” and “discredit the press.” Still, it wasn’t until the Watergate story broke and investigations proved Nixon’s intent that the media declared the president a liar. If the media wants to retain their credibility, Greenberg argued, they are right to hold back from declaring President Trump, or anyone else, a liar. “Though it may seem fainthearted to use words like ‘falsehood’ and ‘untruth,’ in the long run the press will have more influence if it avoids insinuating more than it can confidently assert to be true,” he wrote.

Should journalists use liar anyways?

On January 21, 2019, the Washington Post reported that, in the first two years of his presidency alone, Trump made 8,158 false claims about the economy, immigration, trade, foreign policy, and other matters.

In just one instance in March 2019, Trump wrongly identified Patrick Moore, a man with early involvement in Greenpeace, as a cofounder of the organization in a tweet about him calling climate change “fake news.” Greenpeace was quick to correct Trump on the fact that Moore was not a cofounder, but that didn’t change the fact that many people were exposed to the tweet and may have accepted the president’s words as true.

Since the 2016 US presidential election, people have grown increasingly frustrated with the media’s treatment of public figures who lie, with many concerned that we live in a post-truth society where facts have become irrelevant.

And, it’s not only Trump. That election brought us the Hillary Clinton email scandal, during which Clinton said she “never received nor sent any material that was marked classified” on her private email server as Secretary of State—a claim that Politifact characterized as false.

During the 2016 presidential election, Politifact also found that 84 percent of claims Ben Carson, now Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, made since 2007 were false, including his assertion that there are a “multitude” of unnecessary vaccines available to the public. Texas Senator Ted Cruz told lies about 66 percent of the time in that time frame, including that “the federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls.”

Blurring the lines between fact and fiction even more, Trump has popularized the term fake news—not to call out actual fake news but to discredit anyone or anything perceived as unflattering to him. That strategy has been incredibly effective, and he has succeeded in creating an environment in which the truth is difficult to discern.

Many argue that the media simply can’t tolerate this level of misinformation anymore. Even journalists are starting to call one another out.

In January, Esquire published an op-ed by journalist Dan Sinker called “In 2019, The Media Has to Do Better in Calling Out Trump’s Sh*t [edited].” Sinker noted that journalists don’t use words like lie and liar because they’re supposed to maintain a level of objectivity. Nonetheless, he added:Of course, being objective doesn’t mean letting liars lie. “Balance” isn’t setting two pundits up to argue over what everyone knows is a false statement. There’s no bias in saying something is patently untrue if it is, in fact, patently untrue. In fact, saying things aren’t true from jump is kinda the most important part of the job.Some major news organizations have indeed been using the word liar in content. In August 2018, The New Yorker ran the headline “It’s True: Trump Is Lying More & He’s Doing It On Purpose.” In October, CNN published “Donald Trump Lies And He’s Doing A Lot More of It Lately.” The Atlantic joined the call-out in November 2018 with a piece simply titled: “The President’s Lies.”

In the era of fake news, publications have to contend with the fact that any escalation on their part (i.e., calling someone a liar), also comes with an escalation in the intense scrutiny the media is already facing. The media has the unique ability to speak truth to power, and that includes calling out politicians and not allowing them to get away with lies.

There may be disagreement on where the liar line should be, but that doesn’t change the fact that we need to draw one—even if intent is tricky to determine.

8,948,"It's midday at a busy pediatrician's surgery in Karlsruhe, a mid-sized town in the southwest German state of Baden-Württemberg.

A mother carries her sleeping child into the waiting room, while a sick baby screams so loudly that the receptionist has difficulty making herself understood on the phone.

Over in a corner, an assistant is preparing a combined measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox vaccination for the next patient.

She carefully puts a needle and a syringe on a tray together some medical swabs, and then removes the vaccine from the fridge. It still needs to be drawn and diluted before being injected.

The World Health Organization recommends that all children have two doses of the vaccine to ensure immunity from measles.

""All of my children have been vaccinated against measles,"" says Dr Dieter Knöbl from behind his desk.

Dr Knöbl, one of three pediatricians who work here, has been treating children in this surgery for 20 years. Before that he spent 14 years on the pediatric ward of the Karlsruhe public hospital.

He says he's seen so ""many children suffering from measles and many from measles complications"" that he always advises parents to vaccinate.

The measles complications Dr Knöbl is talking about include middle ear infections, pneumonia and measles encephalitis. The latter is an inflammation of the brain, which can cause permanent brain damage and even death.

Another complication is the quite rare but fatal disease with the unwieldy name of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). With SSPE, the virus slowly attacks the central nervous system.

""It's as if the children have Alzheimer's even though they are young,"" Knöbl says.

""As the disease progresses the infected children physically and mentally deteriorate. They can't speak, they are paralyzed and at the end, they just lie there and gasp for air. It is a wretched death.""

During his time working at the hospital, Dr Knöbl experienced three children dying of SSPE and one of pneumonia.

Measles complications are more common than many people think.

Of the nearly three hundred people who caught measles in an outbreak in Berlin in 2013, more than a hundred ended up in hospital - that's a hospitalization rate of more than 30 percent.

On average, one in a thousand measles patients will develop encephalitis. In western countries, about one in three thousand people infected with measles will die (the figure is much higher in developing countries, where added factors, such as malnutrition, can result in measles fatality rates of up to 30 percent).

To make matters worse, measles is one of the most contagious diseases on the planet.

But many refuse to vaccinate

Despite the risks, there are many parents who refuse to have their children vaccinated.

Some doctor's surgeries in Germany refuse to take on children who haven't had all their jabs, saying it's the only way to protect their other patients.

""That isn't our philosophy,"" says Dr Knöbl.

He and his colleagues believe that by turning away unvaccinated children the parents may deliberately seek out doctors who share their opposition to vaccination.

By keeping the parents coming to his surgery, he hopes there is a chance the doctors can win them over.

""In our experience, the younger the child, the more worried the parents are about vaccinating,"" Dr Knöbl says. ""But if you accept their fears and give them a bit of time, most of them change their mind.""

In 1998, the British medical doctor Andrew Wakefield alleged the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine caused autism.

Although Wakefield's study has since been discredited and withdrawn - and Wakefield has been struck off as a British medical practitioner - rumors of the link continue to abound.

In addition, there are parents who are unwilling to risk their children getting encephalitis, which is a rare side-effect of the vaccine.

At around a chance of one-in-a-million, the risk is considerably less than the one-in-a-thousand chance of developing encephalitis from measles itself.

But add these fears to the general public distrust of doctors, medicines and pharmaceutical companies - which is more pronounced in the southern German states of Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria - together with those who simply forget to bring their child for a follow-up jab and you have a significant number of children who aren't immunized.

In Germany, the measles immunization rate is 92 percent - in Baden-Württemberg it's even lower at 89 percent. This might sound like a lot, but it is well below the 95 percent goal set by Germany and other European nations to eradicate the disease by 2015.

In 2013, the then German health minister Daniel Bahr raised the idea of mandatory vaccination as a way of increasing the measles vaccination rate.

But Dr Günter Pfaff, the chief epidemiologist at the Baden-Württemberg State Health Authority isn't convinced that such measures would work in Germany.

""We probably would have to use more energy to fight against opposition to mandatory vaccination than we could use to convince people that vaccination is good, and that it would be a benefit for their children,"" he says from his office in Stuttgart.

For Pfaff, defeating measles in Germany is about minutely analyzing the data.

He turns around a giant whiteboard covered with a map of the state. It shows the measles vaccination rate for every health district. Some are dark blue - that's good because it means the vaccination rate is more than 95 percent. Others are light blue - which isn't so good.

""You can see there are a few communities, where there is quite a stark contrast between [them and] neighboring communities, and there is hardly another way of explaining this than that the practice of provision of medical services varies from town to town,"" he says.

One approach the state health authority (Landesgesundheitsamt Baden-Württemberg) is looking into is directly approaching doctors in villages and towns with low vaccination rates. It is something Dr Pfaff has tried in a few cases.

""What we [want to do] is ask the doctors 'did you notice that in your town vaccinations are much lower than in the neighboring village? And how come? We would like to draw your attention to this and we would like to talk to you about it,'"" he says.

Another approach they have been using is publishing the measles vaccination rates for villages and districts in community newsletters along with comparisons to neighboring places.

This kind of specific, local information has been found to help more than public information campaigns on a national level or in mainstream, national media.

Whatever the approach, it is possible to eradicate measles.

9,941,"Measles, also called rubeola, is a viral infection that's one of the most contagious infectious diseases in the world. The disease is marked by symptoms that are similar to a common cold, as well as a characteristic red rash. Between 2000 and 2010, the global incidence of measles decreased by 66% and the mortality caused by the disease decreased 74%, according to a report published in the journal The Lancet. Less than two decades ago, measles was almost wiped out in the United States, thanks to vaccines.

But recently, the virus has had a resurgence. Globally, the number of cases has jumped 30% due to vaccine hesitancy. More than 760 cases of measles were reported in the U.S. between Jan. 1 and May 3, 2019, according to Dr. Deepa Mukundan, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at the University of Toledo Medical Center in Ohio. This is up from 372 cases over the entire year in 2018 and up from 120 cases over the entire year in 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

How contagious is it?

Measles is caused by Measles morbillivirus, a virus in the paramyxoviridae family. According to the CDC, the measles virus settles in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person. When a person infected with the virus coughs, sneezes or exhales, the virus becomes airborne and can spread to other people.

""The virus can remain in the air for significant periods of time,"" Mukundan told Live Science. ""One can get the measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been, even up to 2 hours after that person has left.""

Indeed, the virus is incredibly contagious — 90% of people who are not vaccinated against measles will become infected if they share space with someone who has the virus.

""Another reason that it is transmitted so effectively is because the hallmark of measles, the rash, only comes several days after someone is contagious,"" said Dr. Jennifer Lighter, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at New York University Langone Health. Therefore, infected individuals can spread the virus for several days before realizing they're ill. The contagious period lasts about four days before and four days after the rash appears.

A person with measles is likely to infect between 5 and 18 unvaccinated people, according to a 2019 review published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Most cases of measles cause some combination of cough, runny nose, red eyes, high fever and tiny white to bluish spots in the mouth, said Dr. Aileen M. Marty, a professor of infectious diseases at Florida International University's Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine in Miami. As the infection progresses, the characteristic red rash will develop. The rash typically looks like large, red, flat splotches on the skin.

To test for measles, a doctor will examine the patient for telltale symptoms, such as spots inside of the mouth and the skin rash. If the doctor has any doubt, they may order a blood test to confirm infection, according to the Mayo Clinic.

Almost all cases require treatment by a doctor. ""This is a disease where complications are common — complications such as ear infection (acute otitis media), diarrhea and dehydration, pneumonia, encephalitis and even death,"" Marty told Live Science. ""In the United States, one to three of every 1,000 infected persons will die from [measles] complications — which is better than in the Third World, where as many as two to 15 per 100 infected persons die from measles and its complications.""

Young children are much more susceptible to the virus. According to the Mayo Clinic, measles kills 100,000 people a year, most under the age of 5. Pregnant women and those with a compromised immune system are also at risk of severe complications.

There is no specific drug for treating measles. Instead, doctors treat the symptoms. ""This means we provide/advise hydration, antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen) for comfort and fever control, airway humidification in patients with respiratory tract involvement,"" Marty said. Though not licensed in the United States for the treatment of measles, some pediatricians have used Ribavirin, an antiviral medication, to treat severe pneumonia caused by measles, Marty added.

To protect those who have been exposed to the virus but have not been vaccinated, a doctor may order a post-exposure vaccination. If given within 72 hours of exposure, the vaccination may prevent the measles. Even if it doesn't prevent the disease, the vaccinated patient will only have a mild case of the measles, according to the Mayo Clinic. Another way to protect at-risk individuals is to inject them with immune serum globulin (antibodies or proteins derived from the blood of donors with measles immunity) within six days of exposure to the virus. Like a vaccination, this treatment can prevent measles or make the onset less severe.

For many people, recovering from the measles includes resting at home until the symptoms subside. It is important for patients to drink plenty of fluids to replace fluids lost during fevers. It may also be helpful to use a humidifier to relieve congestion and to block out bright lights that may bother sensitive eyes, according to the Mayo Clinic. Once the disease has run its course, the person will be immune to the virus.

However, the immune system may be significantly weakened for up to 2 years after recovering from the measles, according to Lighter. During this time, people can be more susceptible to secondary viral and bacterial infections, which may cause more complications than the original measles infection.

The best way to prevent measles is by vaccination. The CDC recommends 2 doses of the vaccine; the first for those between 12 and 15 months of age and the second for children between 4 and 6 years of age. The vaccine is 97% effective for those who receive both doses and about 93% effective for those receiving one.

Getting the proper vaccinations not only protects the individual receiving the vaccine, it also protects those who cannot be vaccinated: those allergic to components of the vaccine, those with a compromised immune system or those too young to receive the vaccine.

""Vaccines are one of the most effective tools we have to protect public health and prevent deaths around the world,"" said Dr. Scott Lillibridge, an infectious disease expert and professor at the Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Public Health.

About 94% of the U.S. population is vaccinated against measles, according to Mukundan, although there are pockets of people who delay or refuse vaccines. The groups of unvaccinated people make it difficult to control the spread of measles, she said.

""All measles outbreaks in the U.S. start either with a visiting international traveler infected with measles or from an unvaccinated U.S. resident returning from an international trip with a measles infection,"" Mukundan said. The infection is then spread to others in the community who are unvaccinated.

Most measles cases occur in locations with groups of unvaccinated individuals, according to the CDC. In 2000, the U.S. declared that measles was effectively eliminated in the country. But since then, the disease has been making a comeback, likely due to anti-vaxxers.

""The antivax movement is a small percentage of the population but they are loud and draw a lot of undue media attention,"" Lighter said. Anti-vaxxers are driven by emotion rather than the science behind the vaccines, she said.

Modern opposition to vaccines is largely fueled by religious beliefs and the unwarranted concern that vaccines are somehow linked to autism, among other reasons, according to the Measles & Rubella Initiative, a collaboration of the world's largest health organizations that aims to eliminate measles and rubella.

Before the measles vaccine approval in 1963, an estimated 3 to 4 million people in the U.S. contracted the measles per year, with 400 to 500 dying from complications, according to the CDC. Introduction of the vaccine led to a greater than 99% reduction in measles cases in the U.S. A wealth of research has confirmed that there is no relationship between vaccines and autism and has repeatedly validated the safety of the measles vaccine.

""Protect yourself and your loved ones by making sure that they are up to date on the measles vaccine,"" Mukundan said. ""Prevention, meaning vaccination, is always better than cure.""

10,43,"This schedule of recommended immunizations may vary depending upon where you live, your child's health, the type of vaccine, and the vaccines available.

Some of the vaccines may be given as part of a combination vaccine so that a child gets fewer shots. Talk with your doctor about which vaccines your kids need.
• HepB: Hepatitis B vaccine. Ideally, the first dose is given within 24 hours of birth, but kids not previously immunized can get it at any age. Some low birth weight infants will get it at 1 month or when they're discharged from the hospital.
• HepB: Second dose should be given 1 to 2 months after the first dose.
• Hib: This third dose may be needed, depending on the brand of vaccine used in previous Hib immunizations.
• RV: This third dose may be needed, depending on the brand of vaccine used in previous RV immunizations.
• Influenza (Flu): The flu vaccine is recommended every year for children 6 months and older:
• Kids younger than 9 who get the flu vaccine for the first time (or who have only had one dose before July 2019) will get it in 2 separate doses at least a month apart.
• Those younger than 9 who have had at least 2 doses of flu vaccine previously (in the same or different seasons) will only need 1 dose.
• Kids older than 9 need only 1 dose.
• The vaccine is given by injection with a needle (the flu shot) or by nasal spray. Both types of vaccine can be used this flu season (2019–2020) because they seem to work equally well. Your doctor will recommend which to use based on your child's age and general health. The nasal spray is only for healthy people ages 2–49. People with weak immune systems or some health conditions (such as asthma) and pregnant women should not get the nasal spray vaccine.
• HepA: Hepatitis A vaccine; given as 2 shots at least 6 months apart
• HPV: Human papillomavirus vaccine, given in 2 shots over a 6- to 12-month period. It can be given as early as age 9. For teens and young adults (ages 15–26 in girls and boys both), it is given in 3 shots over 6 months. It's recommended for both girls and boys to prevent genital warts and some types of cancer.
• Tdap: Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis booster. Also recommended during each pregnancy a woman has.
• Meningococcal conjugate vaccine: And a booster dose is recommended at age 16.
• Meningococcal B vaccine (MenB): The MenB vaccine may be given to kids and teens in 2 or 3 doses, depending on the brand. Unlike the meningococcal conjugate vaccine, which is recommended, the decision to get the MenB vaccine is made by the teens, their parents, and the doctor.
• HepA can be given as early as 6 months of age to babies who will travel to a place where hepatitis A is common (they will still need routine vaccination after their first birthday). It's also recommended for older kids who did not get it in the past.
• The MMR vaccine can be given to babies as young as 6 months old if they will be traveling internationally. These children should still get the recommended routine doses at 12–15 months and 4–6 years of age, but can get the second dose as early as 4 weeks after the first if they will still be traveling and at risk.
• The flu vaccine is especially important for kids who are at risk for health problems from the flu. High-risk groups include, but aren't limited to, kids younger than 5 years old and those with chronic medical conditions, such as asthma, heart problems, sickle cell disease, diabetes, or HIV.
• Pneumococcal vaccines can be given to older kids (age 2 and up) who have conditions that affect their immune systems, such as asplenia or HIV infection, or other conditions, like a cochlear implant, chronic heart disease, or chronic lung disease.
• The meningococcal vaccines can be given to kids as young as 8 weeks old (depending on the vaccine brand) who are at risk for a meningococcal infection, such as meningitis. This includes children with some immune disorders. Kids who live in (or will travel to) countries where meningitis is common, or where there is an outbreak, also should get the vaccine.

11,885,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are fronting a new campaign looking at mental health issues amid the coronavirus pandemic.

They have been interviewed on the BBC about the scheme - called Every Mind Matters.

Here is the transcript.

Q: How are you helping get the message out there with Every Mind Matters?

Duke of Cambridge: So Every Mind Matters obviously is in its second guise now coming out - we got a lot of feedback from the NHS and from others that people were accessing the online plan, so we felt very strongly that now more than ever this was a vital tool and a vital service that people could easily access at home to guide them and give them just some very basic tips to mind their mental health, to mind their mental wellbeing through this process. I think again staying connected, staying positive and being able to talk to friends and family is so crucial and having just some tips and some ideas as to how to tackle some of these strange feelings and difficult circumstances we’re finding ourselves in is really important, just to nudge us through these next few weeks.

Duke of Cambridge: What I’ve heard as well Tina is about the fact that in many of these cases obviously NHS workers, frontline workers are used to dealing sadly with very sad situations, death and things like that but I think the scale and the speed of what’s going on in hospitals, bearing in mind also the isolation, a lot of these patients are dying with no family members around them. I think for the NHS frontline workers that is very difficult, because they are there right next to the bedsides, looking after and caring for each and every patient in a critical condition and I think they take away that pain and that sometimes that fear and loneliness that these patients have to go through, they’re the ones who absorb that and take it home to their families and I think again, I’ve spoken about the attrition and the daily attrition rate of that happening to somebody is not normal and we’re not super human any of us, so to be able to manage those emotions and that feeling is going to take some time after all this is over as well.

Q: Do you think this will fundamentally change who we are and what we value?

Duchess of Cambridge: Yeah, absolutely, I think what we’re saying now is the NHS and the frontline workers are doing the most extraordinary job and that’s really come to the forefront in the last few weeks and I think it’s going to dramatically change how we all value and see our frontline workers and I think that is one of the main positives that you can take from this. They do an extraordinary job it does unrecognised daily and now I think all of us as a nation can really see how hard they work and how vital their work is.",mainstream,M0a379,vaccine
12,1248,"Days after it was revealed in an intercepted human intelligence report that Bill Gates offered $10 million bribe for a forced Coronavirus vaccination program in Nigeria, now an Italian politician has demanded the arrest of Bill Gates in the Italian parliament.

Sara Cunial, the Member of Parliament for Rome denounced Bill Gates as a “vaccine criminal” and urged the Italian President to hand him over to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. She also exposed Bill Gates’ agenda in India and Africa, along with the plans to chip the human race through the digital identification program ID2020.

As reported by GreatGameIndia earlier, in 2015 it were the Italians who exposed secret Chinese biological experiments with Coronavirus.

The video, which was broadcast in November, 2015, showed how Chinese scientists were doing biological experiments on a SARS connected virus believed to be Coronavirus, derived from bats and mice, asking whether it was worth the risk in order to be able to modify the virus for compatibility with human organisms.

In an extraordinary seven-minute speech met with wide applause, Sara Cunial, the Member of Parliament for Rome said that Italy had been subjected to a “Holy Inquisition of false science.”

She roundly criticized the unnecessary lockdown imposed on her fellow Italians in the service of a globalist agenda.

She urged fellow political leaders to desist in any plans to compel citizens to surrender themselves to compulsory COVID-19 vaccination at the hands of the corrupt elite – whom she identified as the Deep State.

Hobbes said that absolute power does not come from an imposition from above but by the choice of individuals who feel more protected renouncing to their own freedom and granting it to a third party.

With this, you are going on anesthetizing the minds with corrupted Mass Media with Amuchina (a brand of disinfectant promoted by Mass Media) and NLP, with words like “regime”, “to allow” and “to permit”, to the point of allowing you to regulate our emotional ties and feelings and certify our affects.

So, in this way, Phase 2 is nothing else than the persecution/continuation of Phase 1 – you just changed the name, as you did with the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). We have understood people, for sure, don’t die for the virus alone.

So people will be allowed to die and suffer, thanks to you and your laws, for misery and poverty. And, as in the “best” regimes, the blame will be dropped only on citizens. You take away our freedom and say that we looked for it. Divide et Impera (Divide and Rule).

It is our children who will lose more, who are ‘raped souls’, with the help of the so-called “guarantor of their rights” and of CISMAI (Italian Coordination of Services against Child Abuse).

In this way, the right to school will be granted only with a bracelet to get them used to probation, to get them used to slavery – involuntary treatment and to virtual lager. All this in exchange for a push-scooter and a tablet.

All to satisfy the appetites of a financial capitalism whose driving force is the conflict of interest, conflict well represented by the WHO, whose main financier is the well-known “philanthropist and savior of the world” Bill Gates.

We all know it, now. Bill Gates, already in 2018, predicted a pandemic, simulated in October 2019 at the “Event 201”, together with Davos (Switzerland). For decades, Gates has been working on Depopulation policy and dictatorial control plans on global politics, aiming to obtain the primacy on agriculture, technology and energy.

Gates said, I quote exactly from his speech:

“If we do a good job on vaccines, health and reproduction, we can reduce the world population by 10-15%. Only a genocide can save the world”.

With his vaccines, Gates managed to sterilize millions of women in Africa. Gates caused a polio epidemic that paralyzed 500,000 children in India and still today with DTP, Gates causes more deaths than the disease itself.

And he does the same with GMOs designed by Monsanto and “generously donated” to needy populations.

All this while he is already thinking about distributing the quantum tattoo for vaccination recognition and mRNA vaccines as tools for reprogramming our immune system. In addition, Gates also does business with several multinationals that own 5G facilities in the USA.

On this table there is the entire Deep State in Italian sauce: Sanofi, together with GlaxoSmithKline are friends of the Ranieri Guerra, Ricciardi, and of the well-known virologist that we pay 2000 Euro every 10 minutes for the presentations on Rai (Italian state TV. She’s probably talking about Burioni).

Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline sign agreements with medical societies to indoctrinate future doctors, making fun of their autonomy of judgment and their oath.

Hi-Tech multinationals, like the Roman Engineering which is friend of the noble Mantoan, or Bending Spoons, of Pisano, which are there for control and manage our personal health datas in agreement with the European Agenda ID2020 of electronic identification, which aims to use mass vaccination to obtain a digital platform of digital ID.

This is a continuation of the transfer of data started by Renzi to IBM. Renzi, in 2016, gave a plus 30% to Gates Global Fund.

On the Deep State table there are the people of Aspen, like the Saxon Colao, who with his 4-pages reports, paid 800 Euros/hour, with no scientific review, dictates its politics as a Bilderberg general as he is, staying away from the battlefield.

The list is long. Very long. In the list there is also Mediatronic, by Arcuri and many more.

The Italian contribution to the International Alliance Against Coronavirus will be of 140 million Euros, of which 120 million Euros will be given to GAVI Alliance, the non-profit by Gates Foundation.

They are just a part of the 7.4 billion Euro fund by the EU to find a vaccine against Coronavirus – vaccines which will be used as I said before.

No money, ofcourse for serotherapy, which has the collateral effect of being super cheap.

No money for prevention, a real prevention, which includes our lifestyles, our food and our relationship with the environment.

The real goal of all of this is total control. Absolute domination of human beings, transformed into guinea pigs and slaves, violating sovereignty and free will.

All this thanks to tricks/hoax disguised as political compromises.

While you rip up the Nuremberg Code with involuntary treatment, fines and deportation, facial recognition and intimidation, endorsed by dogmatic scientism – protected by our “Multi-President” of the Republic who is real cultural epidemic of this country.

We, with the people, will multiply the fires of resistance in a way that you won’t be able to repress all of us.

I ask you, President, to be the spokesperson and give an advice to our President Conte: Dear Mr. President Conte, next time you receive a phone call from the philanthropist Bill Gates forward it directly to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. If you won’t do this, tell us how we should define you, the “friend lawyer” who takes orders from a criminal.

13,712,"Humans may be to blame for rising mercury levels in a species of fish that's very popular as food, according to a news study published this week. Levels of a potentially poisonous form of the element have been creeping up in Pacific yellowfin tuna 3.8 percent every year since 1998, according to a report discussed an article by the Los Angeles Times.

Methyl Mercury levels in tuna and other large fish have been a public health concern for some time. Health authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration recommend that young children, as well as women who are either pregnant or nursing limit their intake of tuna, and avoid other large species entirely, including swordfish and tilefish.

The study adds to evidence suggesting that human activity—particularly the burning of coal—is causing a buildup of the element in the air and water that is subsequently making its way into the food chain, according to an article in the Los Angeles Times discussing the research. Some fishing industry groups have long maintained that mercury levels in tuna and large fish are stable and come from natural sources, such as deep ocean vents.

Yellowfin—sometimes called ahi tuna—is sold in steaks and eaten in sushi, and can be sometimes found in small amounts in canned light tuna. The fact that the fish are not top-level predators could indicate that a broader swath of ocean life may be accumulating mercury levels that would make them hazardous to human health, if eaten.

""What this number is saying is that the amount of mercury in fish is getting higher and higher all the time, and if it keeps going like that, at some point, most every kind of fish is going to be potentially hazardous,"" study coauthor Carl Lamborg told the Los Angeles Times. ""Where that point is, I don't know.""

President Clinton Unveils Millennium Initiative to Promote Delivery of Existing Vaccines 

in Developing Countries and Accelerate Development of New Vaccines In his State of the Union address, President Clinton will call for concerted international action to combat infectious diseases in developing countries. These diseases cause almost half of all deaths worldwide of people under age 45, killing over eight million children each year and orphaning millions more. The President committed the United States to addressing this terrible problem in his September speech to the United Nations General Assembly. Now the President is asking for foundations, pharmaceutical companies, international agencies, and other governments to join us in this task, and he is announcing these specific elements of his Millennium Initiative:
• A new financial commitment to purchase and deliver existing vaccines in poor countries. As Vice President Gore told the U. N. Security Council earlier this month, the Administration�s FY 2001 budget will include a proposed $50 million contribution to the vaccine purchase fund of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI).
• Increased investments in health in developing countries. The President is calling on the World Bank and other multilateral development banks to dedicate an additional $400 million to $900 million annually of their low-interest-rate loans to expand immunization, prevent and treat infectious diseases, and build effective delivery systems for other basic health services. These investments are as central to economic progress as investments in education and physical infrastructure, and they would build on the new focus on basic health services that we have supported as part of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt initiative. This proposed shift in existing resources does not require additional U.S. budget expenditures.
• A significant increase in basic research on diseases that affect developing nations. The Administration�s FY 2001 budget for the National Institutes of Health includes a sharp step-up in research critical to the development of vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS.
• A new tax credit for sales of vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS to accelerate the invention and production of these vaccines. Because developing countries often cannot afford to buy vaccines, the market provides little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines for diseases that disproportionately affect those countries. This tax credit would provide such an incentive, because every dollar paid by a qualifying organization to buy a qualifying vaccine would be matched by a dollar of tax credits � representing up to $1 billion of additional funding for future vaccine purchases. The President is calling on other governments to make similar purchase commitments, so that we can ensure a future market for these critically needed vaccines. Infectious Diseases Pose a Mounting Social and Economic Burden on Developing Countries � And a Threat to Our Health As Well.
• More than eight million children die each year of centuries-old diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, and respiratory and diarrheal diseases. Deaths from the modern scourge of AIDS are climbing rapidly. Altogether, as many children die of infectious diseases each year as the total number of combatants who perished in World War I.
• In an interconnected and highly mobile world, health crises in other countries are a threat to everyone. We have seen this with HIV/AIDS, with the resurfacing of tuberculosis, and with the outbreak last year of West Nile encephalitis in New York. According to the Global Health Council, during the past 50 years, at least five times as many Americans have died from communicable diseases that have come from the developing world than have died in military conflicts. Vaccines Are One of the Most Cost-Effective Ways to Improve the Well-Being and Productivity of the Poorest Countries � And Medicines and Other Basic Health Services Are a Necessary Complement.
• It costs about $17 to immunize a child, but millions of children die each year of diseases that could be prevented by existing vaccines. Indeed, children in developing nations are 10 times more likely to die of a vaccine-preventable disease than children in developed nations. And these tragedies occur in spite of the enormous efforts of UNICEF and others to vaccinate children, which save 3 million lives each year.
• Highly effective vaccines do not yet exist for malaria, TB and AIDS, which take over 5 million lives each year. But developed nations have the scientific and technological capacity to make new vaccines possible. For example, recent work on genetic sequencing, including the human genome, will open vast possibilities.
• Another health investment with very high returns is simple preventive and curative services. Providing this basic health care together with vaccines would save millions of lives each year. A $50 Million Contribution to GAVI to Buy Vaccines For Children � Which Will Save Lives Now and Create Confidence that a Market for New Vaccines Will Exist in the Future.
• GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, was formed as a collaborative effort of UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, private foundations, bilateral aid agencies (including the U.S. Agency for International Development), industry representatives, and developing countries. GAVI established the �Global Fund for Children�s Vaccines� with an initial grant of $750 million over 5 years from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The formal launch of GAVI, and the official announcement of the Gates gift, will occur shortly in Davos, Switzerland.
• A U.S. contribution will help to purchase vaccines for Hepatitis B, Haemophilus Influenzae B (Hib), and Yellow Fever, along with related safe delivery equipment such as auto-destruct syringes. To ensure that GAVI�s vaccine purchases complement, rather than replace, existing vaccination efforts, they will be conditional on a country achieving 50 percent coverage of the DTP (diptheria-tetanus-pertussis) vaccine, which is included along with measles and polio in the existing EPI (Expanded Program for Immunization).
• A U.S. contribution will hopefully catalyze significant contributions from other countries and foundations. It will also add crucial credibility to the international community�s commitment to provide a market for new vaccines when they are developed. We Must Shift Existing International Resources Toward Building Health Infrastructure in Poor Countries That Can Deliver Vaccines and Medicines and Provide Essential Basic Health Services.
• The World Bank and other multilateral development banks (MDBs, such as the African Development Fund) lend money on highly favorable terms to the world�s poorest countries. Today, roughly $1 billion to $1-1/2 billion of this so-called � concessional funding� is devoted to health care each year. The Administration proposes to increase that amount by $400 million to $900 million per year, with a focus on:
• prevention of diseases using basic measures such as information and condoms for AIDS, treated bed nets for malaria, and stronger systems for containing TB;
• treatment of diseases, including common respiratory and diarrheal infections; and
• The Administration is exploring ways to use the HIPC debt reform to support this part of the Millennium Initiative. One possibility is to make an increase in vaccination rates one of the performance targets monitored in the HIPC progress reports. This could be accompanied by debtor countries� agreements to include specific improvements in vaccine delivery systems as priority uses of debt relief proceeds. We also expect that all Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers that are prepared for HIPC candidates will discuss the adequacy of budget resources and suggested policy reforms devoted to basic health care.
• This re-direction of resources supports the Administration�s overall strategy for global development, which emphasizes poverty reduction and gives a central role to �global public goods� � like health or the environment � in which positive actions taken in one country benefit other countries as well. To meet this objective, these funds should not come from spending on other basic social programs, such as education and health care.
• This aspect of the Millennium Initiative does not require a new budgetary commitment by the United States (or other donor countries). However, the U.S. ability to influence the direction of MDB lending and the use of HIPC proceeds depends crucially on meeting our existing commitments to these aid programs. We will work with other G-8 finance and development ministries to refine this proposal.
• A conservative estimate suggests that if basic health care including immunization were made broadly available, up to 2 million children�s lives could be saved each year. Higher Funding for Basic Scientific Research Through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Elsewhere Will Hasten the Development of Vaccines for Malaria, TB, and AIDS.
• The Administration�s FY 2001 budget for NIH includes a significant increase in research critical to creating vaccines for these diseases. For malaria and TB, this increase will build on recent advances in the genetic sequencing of these diseases, which have set the stage for major breakthroughs in vaccine development.
• Funding for NIH malaria vaccine research will increase more than 10 percent over the FY 2000 level. Future research will range from pre-clinical studies aimed at improving our understanding of the malaria parasite, through the development of vaccine candidates, to clinical trials judging vaccine efficacy and safety. NIH will also expand its collaboration with scientists in malaria-endemic regions, especially in Africa, to strengthen those regions� capacity for conducting clinical trials of malaria vaccines in the future.
• NIH research on a tuberculosis vaccine will receive over 40 percent more funding than in FY 2000 and more than double the FY 1999 level. NIH will focus on studying the body�s defense mechanisms against TB, and developing and studying vaccine candidates. Through its Tuberculosis Research Unit, NIH supports an international multi-disciplinary team to translate advances in basic research into new tools for fighting TB.
• NIH funding for AIDS vaccine research will increase substantially in FY 2001 and will have more than doubled since FY 1997. These additional resources will allow NIH to accelerate basic research on developing vaccine candidates and to significantly expand testing of potential vaccine candidates in both developing and developed countries. The new Vaccine Research Center on the NIH campus, which will be occupied this summer, will receive a sizeable increase in funding for the development and pre-clinical testing of HIV vaccine candidates.
• The Administration is providing strong support for the path-breaking research on infectious diseases being conducted by U.S. military scientists, including the opening (in October 1999) of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research/Naval Medical Research Center. Working in close collaboration with scientists worldwide, military scientists have developed and tested successful vaccines against Japanese encephalitis and hepatitis A � and they are working to create vaccines and medicines to protect service people, travelers, and millions of others from malaria, HIV/AIDS, and other infectious diseases. A New Tax Credit Would Effectively Provide Up to $1 Billion for Future Vaccine Purchases, Speeding the Invention and Production of New Vaccines.
• Current tax law provides substantial incentives for pharmaceutical research and development, including the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit, the orphan drug tax credit, and an enhanced deduction for charitable contributions of certain products. Nonetheless, pharmaceutical companies may be reluctant to invest in developing vaccines for diseases that primarily afflict people in poor countries, because little or no paying market exists in those countries.
• Under the proposal, the seller of a qualified vaccine could claim a tax credit equal to 100 percent of the amount paid by a qualifying organization that received a �credit allocation� by the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID). The tax credit would match the qualified organizations� expenditures dollar-for-dollar, thereby doubling their purchasing power. A qualifying vaccine would be a new vaccine that received FDA approval for use against malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, or any infectious disease that causes over 1 million deaths annually worldwide.
• For 2002 through 2010, AID could designate up to $1 billion of vaccine sales as eligible for the credit. This tax credit would be limited to new vaccines developed to fight these terrible diseases. The credit would provide a specific and credible commitment to purchase future vaccines at reasonable prices. Together with similar commitments from foundations and other governments, it would provide a critical and powerful incentive to accelerate vaccine research and development.",mainstream,M0a608,vaccine
15,462,"The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is not linked to development of autism spectrum disorders, even among children considered to be at risk, a large new study finds.

Among nearly 100,000 children, receipt of the MMR vaccine did not increase the risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), regardless of whether kids were at higher risk because an older sibling already had the condition, researchers write in JAMA.

""Even for children who are high-risk, the vaccine does not play a role,"" said lead author Dr. Anjali Jain of healthcare consulting firm The Lewin Group in Falls Church, Virginia. ""We don’t know what does unfortunately, but it’s not the MMR vaccine.""

The results should be reassuring, she said.

Autism spectrum disorder is a range of symptoms that often includes difficulties with communication and social interaction, according to the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health. It's may also include restricted and repetitive behaviors.

The 1998 study that claimed to find a connection between the MMR vaccine and ASD was later debunked. The Lancet, the medical journal that originally published it, withdrew it. Studies continue to vouch for the safety of the vaccine.

Still, some people continue to believe that the vaccine is connected to ASD.

Parents of children with ASD may also believe there is a genetic component, and so they decline to vaccinate their other children, Jain and colleagues noted in their report in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

For the new study, the researchers used insurance claims data on 95,727 children followed from birth to at least age five between 2001 and 2012. They also had data on the children's older siblings.

Overall, about 2 percent of the children had an older sibling with ASD. Those children were more likely to go on to develop ASD themselves whether they were vaccinated or not, according to the report.

The vaccine didn't increase their risk, the researchers say.

For example, among high-risk five year olds, ASD developed in 23 of 269 who weren't vaccinated (8.6 percent), compared to 30 of 796 (3.8 percent) who received two doses of the MMR vaccine.

Among kids not at high risk of ASD, 7,735 were unvaccinated at age five and 56 (0.7 percent) were diagnosed with the condition. That compared to 244 of 45,568 children (0.5 percent) who received two MMR doses.

Furthermore, children with an older sibling with ASD were significantly less likely to have received the MMR vaccine in the first place.

By age five, about 92 percent of the children without ASD in the family had received at least one MMR dose. By comparison, only 86 percent of children with an older sibling with ASD had been vaccinated by that age.

""I think it’s important to show that the degree of undervaccination in the families with children with autism spectrum disorder was significant,"" Jain told Reuters Health.

Alongside the lack of association between the vaccine and ASD, the undervaccination rate deserves attention, she said.

Roughly a dozen studies have shown that age of ASD onset and its severity do not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, wrote Dr. Bryan King, program director of the Autism Center at Seattle Children's Hospital, in an editorial accompanying the new study.

The new study, King added, now shows that ""the risk of ASD recurrence in families does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children.""",mainstream,M09b4b,vaccine.autism
16,1022,"Last week, Jerome Adams, the Surgeon General of the United States, announced that the federal coronavirus taskforce has turned its back on the “predictive contagion” computer models pushed by international health “experts” — who advised the U.S. government to shut down nonessential services and force unemployed citizens to huddle at home in fear rather than suffer monumental losses from possible exposure to the virus.

During a live interview on Sirius XM radio, the nation’s top doctor said that data from the World Health Organization (WHO), U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Bill Gates (“King Vaccine”) would be shelved in favor of real data:

“What the American people need to know now is we actually have data and so we’re tracking that data.”

Alarmingly high WHO estimates of the number of people in this country considered at risk from getting and dying from the Wuhan coronavirus have proven to be grossly inaccurate. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have not succumbed to the novel strain of infection, as these self-styled experts insisted.

It has been confirmed that various coronavirus reporting agencies have artificially inflated the real number of diagnosed cases and deaths directly due to a COVID-19 infection. The reason behind this charade is to generate fear, make the masses compliant with New World Order directives, and topple the U.S. economy.

A growing number of independent international health experts are contradicting the alarmism being spread around the world in the face of a bad case of the flu. Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi, a microbiology specialist, professor at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany, and head of the Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, said:

“We are afraid that 1 million infections with the new virus will lead to 30 deaths per day over the next 100 days. But we do not realize that 20, 30, 40 or 100 patients positive for normal coronaviruses are already dying every day.” [emphasis added]

Dr. Bhakdi called the government’s COVID-19 response measures “grotesque, absurd and very dangerous,” and added that they are shortening the life expectancy of millions of people. The panic is a fraud, according to the much-cited research scientist:

“The horrifying impact on the world economy threatens the existence of countless people. The consequences on medical care are profound. Already services to patients in need are reduced, operations canceled, practices empty, hospital personnel dwindling. All this will impact profoundly on our whole society.

“All these measures are leading to self-destruction and collective suicide based on nothing but a spook.”

Dr. Joel Kettner, a professor of Community Health Sciences and Surgery at Manitoba University in Canada, former Chief Public Health Officer for Manitoba province, and Medical Director of the International Centre for Infectious Diseases, said:

“I have never seen anything like this, anything anywhere near like this. I’m not talking about the pandemic, because I’ve seen 30 of them, one every year. It is called influenza. And other respiratory illness viruses, we don’t always know what they are. But I’ve never seen this reaction, and I’m trying to understand why.”

Many observers agree with Dr. Kettner’s assessment of the message being broadcast by the globalist health nazis:

“I worry about the message to the public, about the fear of coming into contact with people, being in the same space as people, shaking their hands, having meetings with people. I worry about many, many consequences related to that.”

Adams told Alex Marlow, host of Breitbart News Daily, that the real numbers show that businesses are safe to re-open in May and June. The NWO health nazis want U.S. business owners to fail by keeping them idle for six months or more. They are trying to push a national vaccine ID card that would determine whether or not citizens can travel or renew their driver’s licenses.

The Surgeon General said that, based on actual test data rather than doomsday prophesies based on theoretical computer simulations, U.S. businesses “in some places” can expect to resume operations in May or June. Locations hardest hit by the contagion, however, will continue living with the current medical lockdown:

“Other places won’t; it will be piece by piece, bit by bit, but will be data-driven,” advised Adams.

Frustrated citizens around the U.S. are gathering at their statehouses to voice their opposition to the prolonged enforced idleness and ridiculously unfair new rules on what is nonessential, including tools and seeds, from petty bureaucrats enjoying expanded powers under the national emergency.",conspiracy,C00f7e,bill.gates; vaccine.covid
17,737,"The U.S. government alone spends $200 million a year on a hunt for a vaccine against AIDS. At the forefront of that search stands Dr. David Baltimore, chairman of the National Institute of Health's AIDS Vaccine Research Committee. Currently president of the California Institute of Technology as well, Baltimore won the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Betsey Arledge, producer of the NOVA film ""Surviving AIDS,"" interviewed a cautiously optimistic Baltimore on the current state of the search for a vaccine.



 

 NOVA: Can you give me a sense of the magnitude of the AIDS epidemic at this time?



 Baltimore: The AIDS epidemic in this country is a serious issue, but it's not a major public health disaster the way it is abroad. In the world today there are something like 34 million infected people, and more people are being infected every minute. On the scale of any public health issue in the world, this is one of the major ones. There are more people dying of AIDS than of almost any other infectious disease, with tuberculosis and malaria being in the same ballpark. It's a horrendous situation. (See AIDS in Perspective.)



 NOVA: Do you think we're getting a little complacent in this country?



 



 Baltimore: I'm impressed that AIDS remains a very noted disease in the United States. It's noted in the newspapers all the time—what's going on in the world and in the country. There is very complete coverage of how good the drugs are and where the vaccine program stands. I don't think we've allowed it to fall off the radar screen. And we do far more AIDS research than the whole rest of the world; in the vaccine area alone, we do probably 90 percent of the research.



 NOVA: Can you give me a sense of the amount of effort—not just money, but intellectual effort—that has gone into trying to find a vaccine over the past 10 or 15 years?



 



 Baltimore: When H.I.V. was first discovered, the first thing that the then-Secretary of what became the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said was, ""We will have a vaccine in short order."" She was wrong about that, but it shows that from the very first moment a vaccine was on people's minds. Indeed, there has been a significant effort to make a vaccine from the very first day. I think people thought it would be simple, because we'd made vaccines for so many different viruses.



 The polio vaccine is effective because, for the most part, our bodies naturally fight this virus. This is not the case with HIV. The thing that worried me at the time—and it has turned out to be the biggest worry—was that if it were possible to make a vaccine, why doesn't the body ordinarily fight off the virus? Most viruses we fight off very well, including polio and even smallpox. A certain fraction of people may be maimed or killed by those viruses, but the much larger fraction of people get over them. That's not true for H.I.V. We knew that from very early on.



 



 At first we thought it might be that many people would be killed by it, and then we began to realize that almost everybody who had the infection was potentially going to be killed by it. That's fundamentally different than other viruses. And that fundamental difference was a red flag. The initial impetus that we'd be able to do it, it's around the corner, was just all wrong.



 NOVA: So the search for a vaccine has been a real struggle?



 Baltimore: It's been an enormous struggle, because the obvious things didn't work, and people got very frustrated by that. The next question became: Where do you turn? What's not obvious? What can we do? That involved bringing a whole different level of people into the discussion. Not the ordinary people who make vaccines, but people whose scientific focus is in other areas of immunology, of infectious disease—basic scientists. So it's been a ramping up process to get more and more people involved and thinking about it.



 Perhaps the most important role of the committee I'm now heading is to galvanize the scientific community to find new routes in thinking about a vaccine, so that maybe we can find a vaccine through some very non-traditional approach.



 NOVA: An international team of scientists announced recently that they had traced the origin of the AIDS virus to a subspecies of chimpanzee in Africa. If this report is verified, how will it help in the search for a vaccine?



 Baltimore: In truth, it will not have much effect on the search for a vaccine. However, it tells us a lot about why HIV is so hard to counter. It is not a virus that is native to the human species, and therefore it is continually mutating in an effort to adapt. Most human viruses are well-controlled by the human immune system, because they have evolved with it, and the two opposing forces are in a steady-state. We cannot wait until we and HIV evolve to being comfortable with each other. We must devise a vaccine, effectively short-circuiting the usual process of adaptation.



 NOVA: Who are the so-called long-term non-progressors, and how do they fit into the search?



 Bob Massie is a long-term non-progressor. His immune system's ability to fight HIV is inspiring a new approach to fighting AIDS. Baltimore: There is a small group of H.I.V.-infected people—maybe five percent—who don't get any symptoms and whose virus is maintained at a very low level. If we could find out the secret behind that, maybe we could replicate it in a vaccine. So far we haven't found the secret, but there are good correlations. These people have a good cytotoxic T lymphocyte response, they have a good helper T cell response. [Cytotoxic T lymphocytes, otherwise known as CTLs or CD8 killer T-cells, are cells involved in immune defense that can kill other cells infected by viruses. So-called CD4 helper T cells are essential for triggering antibody production, activating CTLs, and initiating other immune responses.] So that says if we can make those a focus of activity, maybe we can design a vaccine around those principles. But there's no certainty that those are the key issues.



 



 There is a balance of three things: whether the virus that those people have is different than the virus other people have; whether their immune system is somehow responding to it differently than other people's immune systems are; and whether their genetics are different. Are they inherently able to fight the virus? Or is it something that's learned and that therefore we could teach other people to do?

18,532,"This week, the first patients in a clinical trial for a potential COVID-19 vaccine were given shots, marking a key step in the global race to find a cure. Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute in Seattle developed a COVID-19 vaccine in record time and started administering the shots on Monday.

The first person to receive a dose of the potential vaccine was 43-year-old Jennifer Haller, an operations manager at a small tech company, according to The Associated Press. ""We all feel so helpless. This is an amazing opportunity for me to do something,"" Haller said, adding that her two teenagers ""think it's cool"" that she's taking part in the study.

Ultimately, 45 volunteers, ages 18 to 55, will get two doses the vaccine over a span of about 6 weeks, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the NIH, is funding the trial. The vaccine is called mRNA-1273 and was developed by NIAID, and Moderna, Inc., a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company.

""Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,"" NIAID Director Anthony Fauci said. ""This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.""

Other potential COVID-19 vaccines are being developed around the world, including at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. On Monday's ""CBS Evening News,"" David Martin spoke to doctors there to learn more about the potential cures.

Dr. Kayvon Modjarrad, a director at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, is testing a potential vaccine that would block the virus from attaching to a person's lung. ""If it can't get into your lung cells, it can't cause the disease,"" Modjarrad said.

Still, the race for the coronavirus vaccine could take 12 to 18 months to run, Martin reports. So, Lieutenant Colonel Mara Kreishman-Deitrick is working on a drug that people who already have the disease can take.

""What we're aiming to develop here is an antiviral treatment that will kill the virus and actually cure them of the disease so they don't further spread it to the rest of the community,"" she told Martin.

Kreishman-Deitrick says an existing drug used against Ebola may work against the novel coronavirus as well. ""It's ready for a clinical trial in humans and once those clinical trials show that it's affected then it will be available for wider use in humans,"" she said. It hasn't yet been proved effective but could be used as an emergency treatment.

COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has killed at more than 90 people in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. Globally, the death toll is over 7,500, with the most aggressive outbreaks still spreading in Europe and Iran.

Dr. Caitlin Rivers, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said Tuesday in a live webcast about the coronavirus pandemic that ""in some respects we are just getting started in the United States.""",mainstream,M0b986,vaccine
19,723,"A new trial has begun in Victoria this week to evaluate a potential vaccine against COVID-19.

The vaccine is called NVX-CoV2373 and is from a US biotech company, Novavax.

The trial will be carried out across Melbourne and Brisbane, and is the first human trial of a vaccine specifically for COVID-19 to take place in Australia.

This vaccine is actually based on a vaccine that was already in development for influenza. But how might it work against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19?

Read more: Could BCG, a 100-year-old vaccine for tuberculosis, protect against coronavirus?

Vaccines trigger an immune response by introducing the cells of our immune system to a virus in a safe way, without any exposure to the pathogen itself.

All vaccines have to do two things. The first is make our immune cells bind to and “eat up” the vaccine. The second is to activate these immune cells so they’re prepared to fight the current and any subsequent threats from the virus in question.

We often add molecules called adjuvants to vaccines to deliver a danger signal to the immune system, activate immune cells and trigger a strong immune response.

Read more: Revealed: the protein 'spike' that lets the 2019-nCoV coronavirus pierce and invade human cells

The Novavax vaccine is what we call a “subunit” vaccine because, instead of delivering the whole virus, it delivers only part of it. The element of SARS-CoV-2 in this vaccine is the spike protein, which is found on the surface of the virus.

By targeting a particular protein, a subunit vaccine is a great way to focus the immune response.

However, protein by itself is not very good at binding to and activating the cells of our immune system. Proteins are generally soluble, which doesn’t appeal to immune cells. They like something they can chew on.

So instead of soluble protein, Novavax has assembled the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into very small particles, called nanoparticles. To immune cells, these nanoparticles look like little viruses, so immune cells can bind to these pre-packaged chunks of protein, rapidly engulfing them and becoming activated.

The Novavax vaccine also contains an adjuvant called Matrix-M. While the nanoparticles deliver a modest danger signal, Matrix-M can be added to deliver a much stronger danger signal and really wake up the immune system.

The Novavax vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is based on a vaccine the company was already developing for influenza, called NanoFlu.

The NanoFlu vaccine contains similar parts – nanoparticles with the Matrix-M adjuvant. But it uses a different protein in the nanoparticle (hemagglutinin, which is on the outside of the influenza virus).

In October last year, Novavax started testing NanoFlu in a phase III clinical trial, the last level of clinical testing before a vaccine can be licensed. This trial had 2,650 volunteers and researchers were comparing whether NanoFlu performed as well as Fluzone, a standard influenza vaccine.

Read more: Where are we at with developing a vaccine for coronavirus?

An important feature of this trial is participants were over the age of 65. Older people tend to have poorer responses to vaccines, because immune cells become more difficult to activate as we age.

This trial is ongoing, with volunteers to be followed until the end of the year. However, early results suggest NanoFlu can generate significantly higher levels of antibodies than Fluzone – even given the older people in the trial.

Antibodies are small proteins made by our immune cells which bind strongly to viruses and can stop them from infecting cells in the nose and lungs. So increased antibodies with NanoFlu should result in lower rates of infection with influenza.

These results were similar to those released after the phase I trial of NanoFlu, and suggest NanoFlu would be the superior vaccine for influenza.

So the big question is – will the same strategy work for SARS-CoV-2?

The new phase I/II trial will enrol around 131 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 59 to assess the vaccine’s safety and measure how it affects the body’s immune response.

Some volunteers will not receive the vaccine, as a placebo control. The rest will receive the vaccine, in a few different forms.

The trial will test two doses of protein nanoparticles – a low (5 microgram) or a high (25 microgram) dose. Both doses will be delivered with Matrix-M adjuvant but the higher dose will also be tested without Matrix-M.

All groups will receive two shots of the vaccine 21 days apart, except one group that will just get one shot.

This design enables researchers to ask four important questions:
• None can the vaccine induce an immune response?
• None if so, what dose of nanoparticle is best?
• None do you need adjuvant or are nanoparticles enough?
• None do you need two shots or is one enough?

Read more: Coronavirus anti-vaxxers aren’t a huge threat yet. How do we keep it that way?

While it’s not yet clear how the vaccine will perform for SARS-CoV-2, Novavax has reported it generated strong immune responses in animals.

And we know NanoFlu performed well and had a good safety profile for influenza. NanoFlu also seemed to work well in older adults, which would be essential for a vaccine for COVID-19.

We eagerly await the first set of results, expected in a couple of months – an impressive turnaround time for a clinical trial. If this initial study is successful, the phase II portion of the trial will begin, with more participants.

20,63,"James Jeffrey ""Jeff"" Bradstreet (July 6, 1954 – June 19, 2015), was an American doctor, alternative medicine practitioner, and a former preacher[2] who ran the International Child Development Resource Center in Melbourne, Florida,[3] a medical practice in Buford, Georgia[4] and in Arizona, where he practiced homeopathy.[5][6] He also founded the Good News Doctor Foundation, which aimed to combine Christian beliefs with his medical practice.[7]

Bradstreet obtained a Florida medical license in 1984. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of South Florida in 1976, where he also went to medical school beginning three years later. His postgraduate research focused on aerospace medicine, and he received his training in this field from Wilford Hall Medical Center. He was an adjunct professor of child development and neuroscience at the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine in Tempe, Arizona.[8]

Bradstreet published autism research, which he claimed indicated vaccines as a cause, in the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, which is not indexed by PubMed. This research claimed that autistic children had a higher body burden of mercury,[9] and that three autistic children had measles RNA in their cerebrospinal fluid.[10] The Institute of Medicine has rejected any relationship between vaccines and autism.[11]

Bradstreet treated an autistic child named Colten Snyder (one of the test cases in the autism omnibus trial) with chelation therapy on the premise of removing mercury from his body, in spite of the fact that hair, blood, and urine tests had failed to show he exhibited abnormal levels of mercury.[12] Over an eight-year period, Colten visited Bradstreet's office 160 times.[13] Stephen Barrett has stated, ""It appears to me that Bradstreet decides which of his nonstandard theories to apply and records diagnoses that embody them,"" and describes Bradstreet's mercury provoked tests as ""phony"".[12] Peter Hotez characterized Bradstreet's proposal to treat autism with chelation therapy as ""dangerous.""[6]

In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Bradstreet defended the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as an autism treatment, saying, ""Every kid with autism should have a trial of IVIG if money was not an option and IVIG was abundant.""[14] Bradstreet also published research regarding the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for autism,[15] some of which concluded it was ineffective,[16] as well as a paper arguing that autistic children have an increased vulnerability to oxidative stress.[17] Further treatments Bradstreet used on autistic children included the controversial protein GcMAF, with which he claimed to have treated 600 children.[18] In an article for an anti-vaccine magazine, Bradstreet endorsed stem cell therapy as an autism treatment.[19]

Bradstreet was found dead from a gunshot wound to the chest in the Broad River in Rutherford County, North Carolina in June 2015, after his Buford, Georgia medical office was raided by the FDA in connection with an investigation into GcMAF treatments.[4][20][21] At the time of his death, he lived in Braselton and ran his medical practice in Buford.[4] While the police ruled Bradstreet's death a suicide, several family members and anti-vaccine activists claimed he was murdered in connection with his criticism of vaccines.[22]

Bradstreet's son is autistic, which Bradstreet attributed to a vaccination his son received at age 15 months.[23]

21,331,"Measles cases have spread across the US this year, with the state of New York now facing its worst outbreak in decades.

Since last autumn, more than 150 cases have been recorded in Rockland County, a New York suburb home to a large ultra-Orthodox Jewish community where there has been some resistance to vaccinations.

The vast majority of US states allow families to opt out of getting vaccinated if they object on religious grounds and parents seem to take advantage of these rules.

Researchers have found that broad philosophical and religious exemptions to vaccine requirements are associated with higher rates of unvaccinated children.

But this year’s outbreaks are now raising public health questions about why states allow such exemptions. Here is how religious exemptions work:

What is a religious exemption to a vaccine, and which US states have them?

Religious exemptions allow parents to opt their children out of mandated vaccination policies if they object to the vaccine for religious reasons and if they follow the state’s opt-out process.

Almost every state, plus Washington DC, allows for a religious exemption beginning at least in kindergarten.

Four states do not: California, West Virginia, Mississippi and Arizona.

Each state has its own rules regarding vaccinations for children who attend public schools. In addition to the religious exemption, all 50 states, plus Washington DC, allow exceptions for medical reasons.

Examples include a child who has a condition like cancer or an immune disorder where a vaccine could be harmful to the child’s health.

And more than a dozen states offer philosophical exemptions, sometimes known as personal-belief exemptions, which do not require that a parent’s desire to opt out be specifically about their religious beliefs. Instead, they can include exemptions for conscience or moral ideology.

California, West Virginia and Mississippi, which do not allow religious exemptions, also do not allow philosophical objections.

How are religious exemptions connected to the recent US measles outbreak?

The measles outbreak in the New York suburb of Rockland County has largely been cantered in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, where there has been some recent resistance to vaccinations.

Vaccination rates tend to be low among the ultra-Orthodox, and the reasons vary, from fear of interference from outsiders to confusion over accurate religious and medical information.

The current flare-up in New York and New Jersey, both of which allow religious exemptions, can be traced back to the measles outbreaks in Israel last year.

Because ultra-Orthodox parents often send their children to their own religious schools, the outbreak was initially largely contained. But it has recently spread significantly.

Some Orthodox Jewish schools have been allowing unvaccinated children to attend school, against the New York Health Department’s mandate, during the measles outbreak.

How are vaccines a religious issue for some people?

Some people worry that vaccinating interrupts a divine plan for someone’s life, and they do not want to interfere in God’s will.

Others have concerns that some vaccines could violate religious dietary laws, unless they are designated kosher or halal.

Last year an influential Islamic group in Indonesia issued a controversial fatwa, which was later overturned, against the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine, citing its use of porcine gelatin.

And many of those who oppose abortion object to certain vaccines, like those designed to prevent chickenpox or hepatitis A.

Those vaccines are made by growing viruses in fetal embryo fibroblast cells, or cell lines that are grown in laboratories but are derived from two elective abortions in the 1960s.

A Catholic family in Kentucky, for example, has filed a lawsuit against the Northern Kentucky Health Department for banning unvaccinated students from school and athletics during a chickenpox outbreak at their son’s Catholic school.

Are the recent measles outbreaks causing some US states to reconsider exemptions?

To an extent, yes. Vaccine exemptions for children enrolled in kindergarten have slowly grown over the past decade, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), prompting some states to consider changes.

California got rid of its non-medical exemptions in 2015. A few states that allow religious exemptions have made them more difficult to get, requiring things like a signed affidavit from a religious leader instead of simply filling out an online form.

State lawmakers, often Republicans, around the country introduced more than 150 bills from 2011 through 2017 that would have made it easier to obtain exemptions from vaccine policies.

But according to a study in the American Journal of Public Health published in January, the 13 bills signed into law actually limited the ability to exempt.

Some professional organisations have also taken action. The American Association of Pediatrics has made the elimination of non-medical vaccination exemptions its top priority this year, even ranking it above family separations at the border.

Are religious leaders doing anything to address the issue?

Yes. Rabbis and doctors organised a public health campaign to stress the importance of vaccines. The Orthodox Union and the Rabbinal Council of America have strongly urged parents to vaccinate their children.

“It is well known that those facing even a potential life-or-death situation are instructed to set aside the Sabbath and other key tenets of halachic (Jewish law) observance until the emergency has passed,” they said in November.

Elsewhere, local health and community leaders have stressed open communication between health officials and religious leaders to bridge cultural divides.

In Colorado, Dr Joshua Williams, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, has recommended that the groups talk at specific times, such as when the academic year begins or at the start of influenza season, and not just during a health crisis.

He is also working with the state’s Council of Churches to hold sessions with parishioners to hear their concerns.

“Religious vaccinations exemptions impact public health,” Dr Williams said. “There is a need to dialogue with religious leaders around vaccine exemptions at local and national levels.”",mainstream,M09bbb,vaccine.autism
22,1041,"Prof Openshaw, an expert in experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said: ""We're actually considering a paper at Nervtag this week which is about targeting of different sub-populations with vaccines.

""I would say that sometimes it's possible to protect a vulnerable group by targeting another group. This, for example, is being done with influenza.""

Although they stand to benefit most because of their vulnerability, older people often derive the least benefit from vaccines because the drugs tend to prompt a weaker immune response.

Prof Openshaw said healthcare workers and people in other public-facing jobs could also be considered for vaccination first.

Also giving evidence, Professor Arne Akbar, the president of the British Society of Immunology, said: ""Vaccines don't work very well in older people. This has been shown with many other vaccines in the past.

""So we might have to have something as well as a vaccine to get optimum protection for older people.""

He suggested that, alongside a vaccine, older people could be offered an anti-inflammatory drug such as dexamethasone, which has recently shown strong results in those who are severely ill with coronavirus.

""Just a vaccine alone will help the younger people, and that will be good because then, if the younger people are not infected, they will not spread it to the older people – but it won't directly help the older group very much,"" Prof Akbar said.

His comments came as a new study of the potential Oxford vaccine in pigs found that two doses induced a better response than one.

This will include developing technology which automatically identifies and removes messages that incite violence….. The G7 will support the creation of an international industry-led forum to develop and share tools of this type, she said.

Of course by extremism they are referring to ISIS and the radicalisation of young muslim men, well at least that is what we are led to believe is their purpose for such measures.

Contact tracing 'will save lives' if the U.S. builds it

In lieu of federal leadership, the effort has been largely relegated to often underfunded health departments that are struggling to meet the unprecedented demand placed on them by the coronavirus pandemic. ″[Contact tracing] is a standard tool and it really works, but when it's not in place, or in the case of when you start trying to implement it after the virus is quite literally already spreading in your community, it's almost impossible to catch up,"" said Dr. Karen Smith, former director of the California Department of Public Health.

Google's U.S. ad revenue will drop for the first time ever, as the pandemic delivers blow to businesses

12:55 p.m. ET — Google's U.S. advertising revenue will see its first-ever decline this year, according to research firm eMarketer, which began modeling the business in 2008. The new report shows the extent to which even Google's robust digital ad business has likely suffered during the coronavirus pandemic, which has taken an especially hard toll on some of the platform's biggest advertisers in the travel industry. While advertising on YouTube is expected to grow, it won't make up for Google's expected 7.2% drop in net U.S. search ad revenue this year, according to eMarketer. The model also signals that Google's digital advertising rivals may be able to close in on the company's No. 1 spot in share of digital ad spend in the U.S. Both Facebook and Amazon are expected to continue growing their U.S. advertising revenue this year, though at slower rates than in previous years. Facebook and Amazon's ad businesses have less exposure to the travel industry than Google, which could help them weather the crisis. —Lauren Feiner

10:34 a.m. ET — With New York City moving its next phase of reopening, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb says the city and region are unlikely to see a major spike in new cases. Some states mostly in the South and West that reopened early — before they had driven spread down to a contained level and before they had the necessary testing and tracing infrastructure in place — have seen major resurgences in infection over the past couple of weeks. ""We'll see an increase in cases, but we're reopening against a much different backdrop,"" Gottlieb said on ""Squawk Box."" ""So I wouldn't expect to see the big increases that they're seeing in the Southeast and the South here when we reopen."" Gottlieb said that because so many people were initially infected in New York City and the tri-state region, a large portion of the population likely has some level of immunity against the virus already. That will help limit spread, Gottlieb added. —William Feuer Disclosure: Scott Gottlieb is a CNBC contributor and is a member of the boards of Pfizer, genetic-testing start-up Tempus and biotech company Illumina.

25,367,"Legendary gold and market expert Jim Sinclair says the virus that originated in China may have, oddly enough, done some good. Sinclair explains, “The effect of the coronavirus was literally to shut down business globally, therefore, shut off the demand for loans, which also shut off demand for short term money. So, what the public has not seen, is not considering and does not understand is we were stepping into the door of a major financial crisis magnitudes larger than what happened in 2008 and 2009. It’s a horrible thing that this virus occurred, but if it had not occurred, we would have been in a crisis much more serious than 2008 and 2009. . . . It was blowing sky high . . . . Shutting down demand is all we could do. It stopped the explosion of interest rates.”

Where do we go from here? Sinclair says, “We are going to make a recovery. It’s not going to be a ‘V’ by any means. The stock market could be a ‘V’ because the stock market has very little to do with reality. . . . As far as business is concerned, very serious damage has been done to the infrastructure to the business equation. Many employers are gone. Many corporations have significant readjustments to be able to build up again. The supply lines and logistics, where did everything come from? China. . . . This is a major worldwide adjustment, both economically and politically. . . . We had everything made in the cheapest place possible. . . . This is not a passing phenomenon. . . . The only thing that has been steady is gold. . . . The change that this brings about is a reconstruction of the basic business foundations. It’s a start over, it’s not just a slowdown. How many restaurants make money on 50% of the clients? You can’t. How many automobiles have built up on the lots? Enormous amounts. How many clothing stores shut down full of winter clothes and can’t make the shift to summer wear? You can go down the entire line. So, this recovery will be more like an ‘L’. We’ve come straight down, and we are going to go sideways now. . . . Many businesses are not going to open up again. . . .The idea of the coming inflation as a result of this is simple. Everything that you need will go up in price. Everything you don’t need is not going to hold value. You are better off with a freezer full of fine cuts of beef than you are with a brand new Tesla. The beef will go up in price, the Tesla will go down.”

On gold, Sinclair says the ultimate price is an easy-to-calculate math problem. How much gold does America have compared to how much debt it has? So, how high could gold ultimately go? Sinclair says, “It’s simple math. You take the amount of gold the U.S. says it has, and then you take the debt it has, and what price would you need for the debt to balance to zero? The price on the low end is $50,000 per ounce. The true price is $87,500 per ounce.”

Is a biblical debt jubilee coming to America? Sinclair says, “We already have jubilees. If you don’t pay your rent, you have a jubilee. If you don’t pay your student loan, you have a jubilee. If the payment of your auto insurance is postponed, you have a jubilee. We’ve got jubilee after jubilee after jubilee. Keep in mind, one man’s jubilee is another man’s disaster. It’s almost as if the Bible is correct in terms of economics. Also, keep in mind, the people who aren’t being paid are being hurt very badly.”

Sinclair thinks the recovery will take a decade or longer, and Sinclair says, “It will be just like the period between 1929 up to WWII (1941).”

26,774,"The measles outbreaks continue to spread, with New York City declaring a public health emergency and requiring people in four ZIP codes to have their children vaccinated or face penalties, including a fine of US$1,000 and or imprisonment.

Since September 2018, 285 measles cases have been reported in Brooklyn and Queens, mainly in neighborhoods where ultra-Orthodox Jews have chosen to not have their children vaccinated.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that from Jan. 1 to April 4, 2019, 465 individual cases of measles have been confirmed in 19 states. This is the second-highest number of cases since the CDC declared measles eliminated in 2000; in 2014, 667 cases occurred.

Cases have still been occurring each year, often brought into the United States from international travelers. Officials believe that to be the cause of the outbreak in Rockland County, New York, where 168 cases were reported as of April 8, 2019.

Rockland public health officials issued a ban that would keep unvaccinated children out of public places, but a judge overruled that on April 5. On April 9, county officials said they would appeal.

But there are limits to what health care providers, public health officials and legislators can do. It is crucial to consider both the power – and the limits – of potential solutions that will provide education, medical care and protection for the public while still upholding principles of informed consent, parental decision-making and sustaining public trust.

As a professor who researches and teaches health law, public health law and medical ethics, I think it’s worth clarifying what states can or cannot legally do when responding to cases of communicable disease.

The law recognizes the right of an individual to refuse medical interventions. Health law has a strong history of recognizing bodily integrity: Adults can choose whether to accept or reject a proposed medical intervention, even in instances where public health authorities conclude a vaccine would benefit both the individual and society. The Supreme Court has recognized parents’ ability to direct the care and control of their children, including consenting or forgoing medical treatment for their child except in very specific circumstances.

In the 1905 Jacobson v. Massachusetts case, the Supreme Court upheld a state law delegating power to local health officials mandating that adults receive one smallpox vaccine in the midst of an epidemic or pay a fine (about $130 today). Under the concept of police power, states have a duty to enact laws that promote the health, safety and welfare of its residents. Public health authorities may offer vaccines as a method of prevention, but medical professionals, public health authorities and even courts may not legally compel a person to submit to a vaccine.

The Jacobson decision also set forth limits on police power, yet subsequent cases addressing vaccine mandates discarded these requirements, extending multiple vaccine mandates to school attendance for disease not in circulation and in the absence of an epidemic.

Deferring to respected scientific consensus as a means to justify forced medical interventions in the name of individual benefit and the public good has historically resulted in some of the most egregious constitutional and human rights atrocities in the U.S. The mass forcible sterilization during the eugenics movement is but one example.

The history of science and medicine further demonstrates the fallibility of commonly accepted medical knowledge, such as when Bayer introduced heroin as a safe, non-addictive substitute for morphine, or physicians prescribed Bendectin and thalidomide to relieve nausea, only to find these medications resulted in babies born with severe birth defects.

The law is also quite clear that public health authorities and law enforcement may place restrictions on a person’s individual liberty – including religious liberty – in situations where a person’s actions pose a direct, immediate and compelling harm to others, such as using venomous snakes in religious worship or asserting a nonexistent “right” to use an illegal substance such as marijuana when operating a motor vehicle.

In public health law relating to communicable disease, this constitutes a very specific standard: A person must have a present disease, and this person’s actions must pose a direct threat to others.

For example, health officials may seek a quarantine order or civil commitment for a person with active tuberculosis who continues to frequent highly populated public spaces until the person is no longer contagious.

Even in such a case, health authorities can offer treatment and limit a person’s movement to prevent infecting others, but the law does not permit forcibly medicating a competent person against his will.

Accordingly, legal precedent does not support quarantining vast geographic areas of healthy persons who have not been exposed to the communicable illness, but would support tailored voluntary isolation and quarantine of persons who have been exposed to, or currently have, the illness.

What health officials can do to protect children

The CDC classifies vaccines as one of the top 10 public health achievements. The vast majority (about 98%) of parents across the U.S. as a whole comply with the state law mandated schedule of vaccines for their children.

Vaccines, like any other FDA-approved product such as a prescription drug or medical device, carry a set of risks and benefits. These calculations vary depending on the vaccine, its efficacy, safety, potential side effects, the severity of the illness the vaccine aims to protect against, and the individual to whom it is administered.

Vaccine science and practice similarly evolved with historical mistakes (the Cutter incident) and ongoing disputes about risks and benefits for individual vaccines like flu and anthrax.

To promote vaccination for children, health officials may offer educational campaigns and set up free clinics for parents to bring their children. State laws may also mandate vaccines as a condition for school attendance, or require excluding unvaccinated children during an active outbreak at their school.

However, if states offer a religious or nonmedical exemption, courts have been clear that health officials and school officials do not have discretion to require the child’s parent to identify with an organized religion or reject the sincerity of the parent’s beliefs because this violates the First Amendment.

Public health professionals worry that parents who forgo vaccination are placing their child and the community at risk. Some have advocated that the state should step in with coercive measures such as eliminating any nonmedical exemptions for all children or intervene by force, such as classifying parents’ decision as child neglect or seeking a court order to vaccinate the child.

In my opinion, these strategies rely on a distortion of legal precedent, dismiss longstanding authority of parents to make decisions for their children, and threaten to undermine an already fractured public trust.

Cases that uphold state intervention to protect a child by compelling medical treatment generally require that the child has an illness, the illness is severe and life-threatening, and the risks and benefits of intervening are assessed.

This requires medical professionals and health officials to maintain precision in distinguishing whether the parents are deciding to forgo recommended vaccines, or whether they are refusing medical care for a critically ill child. Indeed, a recent case in Chandler, Arizona, demonstrated how a climate of coercion and force may result in parental fear and refusal to constructively engage with state officials for even an ill child.

State public health officials have the duty to protect residents from illness and communicable disease, but these strategies must fall within appropriate legal parameters. Dismissing these legal boundaries or justifying unnecessary force not only undermines fundamental liberties, but in my view fuels parental and community distrust of health officials and sets back the ultimate goals of protecting the public.",mainstream,M0aa09,vaccine
27,756,"Pathogens are microbes that cause diseases . Vaccines allow a dead or altered form of the disease causing pathogen to be introduced into the body, which contain a specific antigen . This causes the immune system, specifically the white blood cells , to produce complementary antibodies , which target and attach to the antigen. When a white blood cell engulfs and digests a pathogen it is called phagocytosis.

During the primary infection the antibodies slowly increase, peak at around ten days and then gradually decrease. A second exposure to the same pathogen causes the white blood cells to respond quickly in order to produce lots of the relevant antibodies, which prevents infection.",mainstream,M07fd6,vaccine
28,887,"A teenager who made headlines for getting vaccinated despite his family's wishes has testified about his experience to US lawmakers.

Ethan Lindenberger, from Ohio, sought immunisations aged 18 after turning to the internet for advice.

Federal data suggests the proportion of US children under two not being immunised has quadrupled since 2001.

Doctors at the hearing blamed online misinformation and discredited science for scaring parents away from vaccines.

Mr Lindenberger, who is still a senior in high school, spoke on Tuesday at the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions alongside four doctors who are experts in the field.

He said much of his mother's opposition to routine vaccines came from fear they could cause side-effects like brain damage or autism.

In 1998, a study by a British doctor Andrew Wakefield incorrectly linked the MMR (Measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine to autism. His research has since been completely discredited and Mr Wakefield has been struck off - but the theory has endured within the global anti-vaccination community.
• 'Don't be taken in by social media vaccine myths'

All four doctors at Tuesday's hearing echoed that there was ""absolutely no evidence"" that exists which supports the link.

This is also affirmed in new Danish research released on Tuesday. The study examined 650,000 children over 10 years and categorically concludes that MMR does not increase the risk of autism or trigger it in those susceptible.

Mr Lindenbenger, doctors and members of Congress at the hearing all pointed out the internet fuels the spread of misinformation.

""My mother would turn to anti-vax groups online and social media rather than health officials and critical sources,"" the teenager told the hearing.

He also pointed out his mother's decision had come from concern, not malice.

""There's a lot of emotional appeals talking about families, children and appealing to a parent's love, and manipulating that to convince them vaccines are dangerous,"" he told the hearing about the nature of online posts.

""That's the issue I take. I have tried to convey to my parents I don't think they are stupid for believing that, but people are very convincing and that's very dangerous.""

Mr Lindenberger's story went viral in late 2018 when he asked online forum Reddit about the subject.

At one point during Tuesday's hearing, Republican Senator Johnny Isakson joked that he would ""love"" to be a guest at the Linderberger family home for Thanksgiving dinner.

""Would be a heck of a discussion everybody would have,"" he said about the family's public disagreement.

Health experts have long warned about the risk posed by parents who do not vaccinate.

They say the decision affects not only their families but everyone else because high vaccination rates are integral to keep communities protected.

This concept, which is known as herd immunity, offers protection for people like newborns and people with auto-immune diseases who are not able to be vaccinated.

The US has been battling a number of outbreaks of preventable diseases in recent years.

Senator Patty Murray, from Washington state, spoke at the hearing about a recent measles outbreak in her local Clark County where 70 cases have been confirmed.

Less than 80% of nursery-age children were immunised there in 2017 - well below the target rate of about 95% for herd immunity.

At Tuesday's hearing, doctors implored the federal government to increase funding for vaccine education. They also asked state lawmakers to increase limits on non-medical vaccination exemptions for parents.

California is one state that has already cracked down on exemptions, following an outbreak of measles linked to Disneyland in 2015.

Similar outbreaks are not isolated to the US - there have been increases recorded elsewhere around the world.

In 2018, Europe saw three times more measles case than the year before.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) have blamed growing vaccine hesitancy for the outbreaks.

29,351,"The best ways to convince people of the benefits of vaccinations may be to show them pictures of a child with measles or to have them read a description of the disease written by a mom whose child was infected, according to a new study.

These ways are more effective than showing people information summarizing recent research that shows there is no link between vaccines and an increased risk of autism in children, the researchers found.

The researchers found that directing people's attention to the risks posed by not getting vaccinated by showing them the pictures of sick children and having them read a mom's written account of her child's disease changed their attitudes, leading them to think more positively about vaccinations, study author Zachary Horne, a graduate student at the University of Illinois, said in a statement.

That was true for even ""the most skeptical participants in the study,"" Horne said.

There were 644 cases of measles in the United States in 2014, according to the study. That's triple the number seen in 2013. And back in 2000, researchers thought that this disease had been eliminated from the U.S., according to the study. [5 Dangerous Vaccine Myths]

""The re-emergence of measles has been linked to an increase in the number of parents refusing to vaccinate their children,"" the researchers wrote in their study. One reason that parents don't vaccinate their children is the mistaken belief that the vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella (the MMR vaccine) is linked with an increased risk of autism. Researchers have been looking for effective ways to convince people who hold this mistaken belief about the benefits of vaccinations.

In the new study, the researchers asked 315 people questions to examine their views on several potentially controversial subjects, including their attitudes toward vaccines and their willingness to vaccinate their kids.

Then, the people in the study were assigned to one of three groups. People in the first group looked at science-based materials that challenged the anti-vaccination point of view. People in the second group read a paragraph written by a mother describing her child's infection with measles, and also looked at pictures of children with measles, mumps or rubella. They also read three warnings about why it is important to vaccinate kids. People in the third group, which was a comparison group, were asked to read about a subject not related to vaccines.

Then, the researchers again evaluated the people's views on vaccination and their intentions to vaccinate their children in the future. The investigators found that the intervention that involved showing people the consequences of the diseases was the one that had the biggest effect on the people who were initially the most skeptical about vaccinations, Horne said.

In contrast, showing people the scientific evidence that there is no link between vaccines and autism did not change the people's views on vaccination, the researchers said. The reason this type of intervention doesn't work is likely that trying to convince someone that his or her beliefs are false is not the best argumentative strategy, Horne said.

The study shows that ""instead of going up against the belief about the link between vaccines and autism,"" researchers should aim to convince people that, independent of whether they believe in that link, they should also believe that there are serious consequences of not getting children vaccinated, Horne told Live Science.

""The insight [from the study] was to direct their attention towards those consequences, rather than trying to combat their false beliefs that there is some link where there is not,"" Horne said.

The new study was published today (Aug. 3) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

 birthday and a second dose when they are aged three years and four months old.

Measles is a viral infection which is spread from person to person. Symptoms of measles include:

Symptoms can last up to 10 days in children and longer in adults. The infection can cause serious complications.

Mumps is caused by a virus. Symptoms for most people are:
• painful swollen glands in the face and neck

Symptoms last up to 10 days. The condition can also cause complications.

Rubella is a mild viral disease, also known as German measles.
• None swollen glands behind the ear and the back of the neck

Some adults also have painful joints. The infection is very serious in pregnancy.

It is important to protect children against measles, mumps and rubella as these diseases can have serious complications.

In some cases, measles can cause death. In children aged under two years, one child in 8,000 will develop a fatal degenerative brain condition within eight years of getting measles.
• deafness - usually with partial or complete recovery

Rubella can cause inflammation of the brain and can affect blood clotting. In pregnant women, it can cause miscarriage or major health problems for their babies such as:

Experts from around the world, including the World Health Organization (WHO), agree that there is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.

Separate vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella are not recommended. Single vaccines put children at risk while they wait between each vaccine. It also means that children need repeat injections and are more at risk of adverse reactions at the injection site.

• Understanding the Basics: General Best Practice Guidelines on Immunization",mainstream,M0a2d8,vaccine
32,1319,"In response to outbreaks of measles in France and Italy, resulting from a growing trend for parents to refuse vaccinations for their children, authorities have announced plans to make childhood immunisation compulsory. Last week, a newspaper editorial demanded similar measures in Britain, insisting that parental refusal of immunisation “should not be tolerated”.

Though I have been actively involved over the past decade in promoting the MMR vaccine in face of claims of a link with autism, I hope British immunisation authorities will continue to resists calls for compulsion.

As the father of a child with autism who was also as a GP administering vaccinations to babies, I read with great interest Andrew Wakefield’s now notorious 1998 study in the The Lancet suggesting a link between MMR and autism. It was immediately obvious that though this paper presented no evidence for this link, it would cause undue alarm among parents of children with autism as well as among parents of children due for vaccinations.

In response I wrote the first of a series of articles, culminating in 2004 in a book MMR and Autism: What Parents Need To Know. This book sought to reassure parents that they had no grounds to fear that MMR had caused their children’s autism, and that it offered effective protection against serious diseases. It was a great relief when Wakefield’s work was finally exposed as fraudulent and he departed Britain to join a wacky fringe of conspiracy theorists and alternative health cranks in the United States.",mainstream,M0bec3,vaccine.autism
0,903,"Those watching President Trump’s rally in Tampa on Tuesday couldn’t help but be exposed to a fringe movement that discusses several loosely connected and vaguely defined — and baseless — conspiracy theories.

In one shot on Fox News, the president was partially obscured by a sign in the crowd reading “We Are Q.” In another shot during the president’s speech, a sign promoting the debunked Seth Rich conspiracy theory, with the hashtag #Qanon, came into focus in the center of the screen. Some attendees wore T-shirts with a blocky Q. Others held up signs with the letter.

They were all self-described “followers of Q,” an anonymous person or group of people who claim to be privy to government secrets. That supposedly classified information has been revealed on the 4chan and 8chan message boards and spread around mainstream internet platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Q has attracted people — the exact number is hard to know — eager to consume his “bread crumbs,” or new details in a sprawling web of conspiracy theories.

1,921,"After years of deflection and foot-dragging, the major tech companies are finally having to take steps toward policing their own content.

They have reached this point kicking and screaming, under great public pressure, after clinging for years to the fiction that they are just public utilities and that people can use their pipes for pretty much anything.

But now they have united, for a brief moment at least, against a major conspiracy theorist.

Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify have all taken action against Alex Jones.

They are deathly afraid of being accused of political bias, sometimes for good reason. Both Facebook and Twitter have both grappled with incidents of discrimination against conservatives, which may have made them gun-shy about banning (as opposed to shadow-banning) some folks.

But almost in unison, the tech giants teamed up against Jones, who runs Infowars.

Candidate Donald Trump appeared on Jones' online show in 2015, and yesterday Jones tweeted a video defense with the headline: ""EMERGENCY: President Trump Must Defend the First Amendment.""

Facebook said it has taken down some Jones pages ""for glorifying violence, which violates our graphic violence policy, and using dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants, which violates our hate speech policies.""

Apple said it removed the ""Alex Jones Show"" and other podcasts from iTunes and its podcast app. The company said it ""does not tolerate hate speech, and we have clear guidelines that creators and developers must follow to ensure we provide a safe environment for all of our users.""

Google’s YouTube dropped the ax on Jones' channel, telling The Washington Post that it terminates users who violate ""our policies against hate speech and harassment or our terms prohibiting circumvention of our enforcement measures.""

And Spotify banned Jones altogether after earlier removing some podcasts, telling the Post: ""We take reports of hate content seriously and review any podcast episode or song that is flagged by our community.""

I know Jones has a lot of fans—remember the controversy swirling around his interview with Megyn Kelly—but he's also a guy being sued by Sandy Hook parents for saying that the horrible massacre at that Connecticut school was a hoax.

Jones apologized last year, in careful language, for spreading the phony Pizzagate conspiracy theory, saying he'd been given inaccurate information.

That’s not ""conservative."" That's at odds with reality.

Jones texted the Post that being banned by the tech companies was ""a counter-strike against the global awakening.""

""We've seen a giant yellow journalism campaign with thousands and thousands of articles for weeks, for months misrepresenting what I've said and done to set the precedent to de-platform me before Big Tech and the Democratic Party as well as some Republican establishment types move against the First Amendment in this country as we know it,"" he said.

Separately, Jones called The New York Times a ""globalist intelligence agency"" and said that the ""evil, wicked sociopaths"" who work for major media outlets were teaming up to take down Infowars.

I confess I'd like to know how the four tech companies happened to take action on the same day. Perhaps they concluded there was safety in numbers. They seemed to have an ally in Drudge, whose banner headline was ""APPLE REGULATES HATE.""

But this is just a skirmish. Just recently, Mark Zuckerberg got himself into trouble by saying he saw no reason to ban pages by Holocaust deniers.

There is a fine line between banning hate and bullying on one hand and censoring controversial political opinions on the other. These battles will play out in a hyperpartisan political atmosphere. But for now, Apple, Facebook, Google and Spotify have all agreed there is one person who falls on the wrong side of that line.",mainstream,M15f1b,pizzagate

ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST: If you only knew what comes on right before the camera comes up. Hello, everyone. I'm Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juab Williams, Melissa Francis and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5:00 in New York City and this is ""The Five.""

Well, we have some breaking news on the Trump transition. Rudy Giuliani is out of consideration for an administration position. We're going to hear from the former mayor in a few minutes. But first, this news comes on a very busy day for president-elect Trump.

Mr. Trump starting off his morning with a face to face meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan at Trump Tower followed by a Get-Out-the-Vote event in Baton Rouge, and now Mr. Trump is headed to Grand Rapids, Michigan, for the next step on his thank you tour kicking off in about a couple hours from now. One common theme in the president-elect speeches, his plan to bring jobs back to America. He doubled down on his promise during a speech in Louisiana this afternoon. Take a listen.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT: It's time to get help for the American people. We're going to get them into the labor market and they're going to do a great job and they're going to make good money. We're going to rebuild our country with American hands by American workers.

My administration will follow two simple rules. Buy American and hire American. OK? We have so many companies right now -- I think probably if I would have said a couple of months ago we have so many companies negotiating to leave, I don't think they're negotiating so fast right now.

BOLLING: All right KG, He promised to make America great again by bringing jobs back to America and keeping American jobs in America. Seems to be keeping his promise.

KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST: Yes, I love it, and also a perfect location and venue to make this kind of speech to connect with the people, the forgotten men and women, the working class people that wanted someone to hear them and put them back to work and put money in their pockets and food on their table.

American cars made by American hands on the streets across this country. I think it's fantastic. This is why people joined his movement and carried him into the White House to try to get this done. And perfect timing as well, of course, with the lawsuits now being dropped for the recount here as well so, it's fantastic.

BOLLING: And also, there's an election tomorrow, that last senate seat is up for gaps tomorrow. Juan, early this morning, Andy Puzder was named or at least tapped to run the Labor Department. Guy has 75,000 people working for him. Seems to me a logical, wise choice to run labor.

JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST: So, no problem with the ladies in bikinis selling hamburgers? You have no problem with this?

BOLLING: So you're talking about the ""Carl's Jr."""" commercials --

WILLIAMS: Yes, I see a lot of feminist --

BOLLING: It's one of the restaurants --

WILLIAMS: Yes, they're not happy. So, but the real argument is that this is a guy who at a time of populist anger about income inequality is opposed to raising the minimum wage, also opposed to the idea that more Americans should be made eligible to receive overtime pay and wants to do away with that Obama era regulation.

BOLLING: Can I just check you on that one.

BOLLING: Andy Puzder supports president Trump. President-elect Trump's minimum wage raises that are ""rational and do not destroy jobs or the businesses supporting them.""

MELISSA FRANCIS, CO-HOST: Well, I think the difference is that he's a job creator not a job killer. And that he realizes that changing the federal minimum wage is putting a mandate on employers that doesn't necessarily make sense. I mean, saying that he isn't in favor of labor is like saying that a general doesn't love his troops.

I mean he's a guy that goes out there and expands business, builds it bigger. He understands what makes it tick. He is highly dependent on labor. I think he loves the guys that work for him and he's a great choice. He understands exactly how business works and how to expand it.

GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST: Are you talking about Andy Puzder? The guy that said that if he had his way he would automate his entire company because robots don't need health care, robots don't sue, robots don't do the slip and pay or whatever you call it?

GUTFELD: Slip and fall -- you're the lawyer. I tried it on you and it never works.

GURFELD: He employs 75,000 people, but on the whole, he would rather employ none. And by the way, I think it's a great choice. I think Puzder is a smart guy. I think he is smart on minimum wage. I think he's smart on overtime, but he's also smart on the realities of automation.

FRANCIS: He wants to automate. I mean who doesn't? He loves automation, grat.

GUTFELD: That's my point. So, you're kind of talking out of both sides here.

FRANCIS: You're going to have no employees at all. No, I'm not. You have to have automation in a business. He wants to keep the employees that he has.

GUTFELD: You're pulling away though. It's fast food.

FRANCIS: It's productive. Yes, you can't stop time. I mean --

BOLLING: Yes, that's my point, you can't. But what if you decided to punish time or punish progress?

BOLLING: But he is also the guy who is in favor of Donald Trump -- president-elect Trump's border policy as well.

BOLLING: Where there are a lot of illegal immigrants who are taking these fast food jobs that Americans could be taking. He promises to implement the agenda.

GUTFELD: I think that's a relatively new thing for Puzder. I think Puzder was definitely into cheap labor up until recently.

BOLLING: Well, I do not think he's for cheap labor. I mean, no.

GUTFELD: I think he was for open borders.

WILLIAMS: So, and let me say for all of our talk at this table -- and I'm worried about your job at the moment given your position here --

WILLIAMS: I think -- let's ask labor. Let's ask the people who run the AFL-CIO. They say this man fights workers. This man is hell on workers.

BOLLING: Juan, you call labor -- big picture labor -- the 11 million people who are in the unions? That's who you call labor? How about the other 130 million Americans who are working who aren't unionized who are against everything union?

WILLIAMS: Against everything (ph). I don't think that's true. I think what you're saying true, is there are fewer and fewer Americans who are in unions from the private sector --

BOLLING: It's 11 million. You know, that's 53 million workforce.

WILLIAMS: Because, look, wages have been going down. People are struggling at times for jobs --

WILLIAMS: No, but what I'm telling you is, big labor is not stupid. This is like the attack on Chuck Jones the other day by Trump.

BOLLING: Big labor is stupid. They are pricing themselves out of the market.

GUILFOYLE: Yes, they are.

GUILFOYLE: Because they're greedy and yes, when you are in a party pig like that.

GUTFELD: But you know what? The choice of Puzder is telling you what the future is. The future is automation. So all of this stuff about saving 1,000 jobs here and 1,000 there, it's not going to stop automation, well, that's artificial intelligence. It's not.

FRANCIS: No, but can I tell you what the difference is though? The automated factory is going to stay here because when it comes down to where they want to have their factory -- I mean, of course, CEO's would rather have it here. They can keep a closer eye on production.

They know that the workers that are there are more efficient, are better. They need lower cost regulation, lower taxes, cheaper energy because we are drill, drill, drill. And they'd rather have the factory here. Yes, the factory is going to have fewer workers but you need some workers to run alongside those robots.

FRANCIS: But it would be better than having the factories in China where they can't keep an eye on it where a bunch of products are so much --

GUTFELD: So you would say it's okay to apply tariffs to a company to keep them from going to China?

FRANCIS: No, I think that's he's opening salvo and then negotiation. I think he's saying we're going to throw this tariff on and I think that that's how you reset the negotiation. I don't believe it would ever come to that or he would actually do that. But if God knows like it's going to, don't tell anyone (inaudible) that he's not going to actually do that but I think he is.

BOLLING: And the Carrier deal, that was a threat, but I'm not sure that they stayed or these jobs -- the 800 stayed because of that. I think it was because it was a good deal to stay tax-wise. They got tax breaks. They got incentives. They got investment and if --

WILLIAMS: What did Sarah Palin call it? Crony capitalism.

BOLLING: And she was right.

WILLIAMS: What did George Will say? Socialism.

BOLLING: I would say George Will is completely off his game. I think George Will at that time was --

GUTFELD: Why? You can't say that. He's right. He's talking about the (inaudible) of free market principal.

BOLLING: The free market principals say if you lower taxes, more corporations will hire more people.

GUTFELD: Yes. But then you don't need coercion to go along with that. You're saying lower taxes as the carrot for the stick.

BOLLING: But he never -- he hasn't coerced anyone. He's not even president yet. He can't coerce anyone at all.

GUTFELD: So he never brought up 35 percent tariff?

BOLLING: He brought it up and he didn't coerce. What he did was secure --

GUTFELD: That's a threat. He did say it was a threat.

BOLLING: Right. He secured millions of dollars of tax incentives. That is what --

WILLIAMS: And Carrier secured millions of dollars of --

BOLLING: Hold on. All right, hold on guys

FRANCIS: It's their money, their money.

BOLLING: Who is the governor of Indiana?

WILLIAMS: Why wouldn't the next guy say give me some of that?

BOLLING: Of course they should and hopefully they get it.

WILLIAMS: This is not a system, an economic system --

BOLLING: Do this. This is a great idea.

WILLIAMS: Eric, this is what they call picking winners and losers.

FRANCIS: No, it's not.

FRANCIS: Why are you against companies keeping their own money? It's not taxpayer money. It's Carrier's money --

WILLIAMS: Oh, well, go for it. Well, then they don't need Indiana's money?

WILLIAMS: Why are they asking for Indiana's money?

FRANCIS: It's their money. They earn profits for giving less of it to the government.

GUILFOYLE: OK, business 101 during the break.

BOLLING: OK, let's do this. As we mentioned earlier, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has removed his name from consideration for a position in the Trump administration, even though he is no longer a contender for a cabinet position. The transition team says Giuliani may join the team at a later date. Giuliani spoke about it moments ago.

RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: My desire to be in the cabinet was great, but it wasn't that great. And he had a lot of terrific candidates and I thought I could play a better role being on the outside. That was the only one I had any real interest in.

BOLLING: So, we bring it around KG. Rudy said -- the former mayor says he pulled himself out of contention. What do you think?

GUILFOYLE: And he did that on the 29th. Removed himself from contention and wrote a letter that they did not want to accept at first because they still wanted to keep him in consideration. He always said that he would be there for this candidate, for president-elect Trump. He was.

He was a very important surrogate on his behalf and very loyal. I'm sure he's going to continue very strongly to be an adviser. Anyone would be lucky to have Rudy Giuliani in any capacity. There are a number of roles he could have fulfilled beautifully in the cabinet so, you know.

Obviously, I'd love to see him serving the country but he's got a very busy life, very active life and with his wife, Judith. So, he's got a lot of options. Let's see what happens.

BOLLING: What about deputy? No one wants to be the deputy?

GUTFELD: Yes, nobody wants to be the deputy. They all want to be the sheriff. Is that how it works? But anyway, he's a great guy. He's like our Churchill in a way. I mean, he was an inspiring person. I hate to say was but I feel like he's retiring and he's pulling back. But he can still be one lucky guy at outnumbered.

GUTFELD: He will be back here.

GUILFOYLE: Well, he just got an award in Colombia for reducing crime there just last night. I mean, you know, he's incredibly talented.

BOLLING: This is an important point. He does very -- his security company does very well internationally advising foreign countries on security.

FRANCIS: Maybe that would have been one of the challenges. I mean, that's one of the things that a lot of people talk about, is that in the process of a confirmation, that he has a lot of interests all around the world that could have been a challenge. He's America's mayor. We love him. What are you going to do?

GUILFOYLE: But he also was thoroughly vetted so, that process already was completed.

BOLLING: What do you make of all this?

GUILFOYLE: Well, I don't buy that he was fairly vetted. But I do buy this, that --

GUILFOYLE: He said it in the interview.

WILLIAMS: I know, well, I would say it, too. But I don't know if it's true. But I'm just saying, I think Rudy Giuliani could have been a great attorney general. I think in fact, he might have done better than Jeff Sessions, the senator from Alabama in terms of getting through.

But what strikes me is he was held on a string. If you remember, when we started these conversations, everybody assumed he was going to get the job. We don't know if he's qualified. Doesn't have a lot of foreign policy experience. But it was assumed he's going to get the job.

Then it starts to go Romney, Petraeus, Senator Corker and maybe he got tired of this game. I mean, he makes a lot of money now going overseas doing the things Kimberly was talking about, giving speeches.

BOLLING: All right. They want us to leave it right there. A programming note, tune in to Fox News Sunday for an exclusive interview with president- elect Donald Trump. Check your local listings.

But up next here, disturbing new details about this illegal immigrant on the run after -- on the run, I'm sorry, after allegedly killing two women in Kentucky. How Mr. Trump's tough immigration stance might fix problems like this when we come right back.

GUILFOYLE: Is this the exact problem Mr. Trump is trying to fix? This man you see on your screen, an illegal immigrant from Mexico is wanted for allegedly killing two people in a hit and run case in Kentucky. Guess what? He has been deported eight times. At his thank you tour stop in Iowa last night, president-elect Donald Trump reiterated his campaign pledge to build a border wall and crack down on illegal immigration.

TRUMP: On immigration, we will build the wall and we will put an end to illegal immigration and stop the drugs from pouring into our country. The drugs are pouring into our country, poisoning our youth and plenty of other people.

A Trump administration will stop the violence that is spilling across our border. And believe me, you've seen now, it is unbelievable how much there is.

GUILFOYLE: OK, so a strong messaging but this is consistent, Melissa, with during the campaign, what he talked about, cracking down on illegal immigration, cracking down on sanctuary cities that would have these people come in, revolving doors to come in to re-offend as criminal recidivist, much like this man did, and then deported eight times. What an insufficient broken system.

FRANCIS: Yes. No, I mean, this has become the issue. Of course, there are so many cities saying they're going to be sanctuary cities here in New York. Mayor de Blasio having a commercial in the back of taxis talking about how proud he is that he's refusing to cooperate with the feds.

I heard Greg say it before and it was so right, that the wall is like the red shiny bike under the Christmas tree, and God help him if the kids come down in the morning for Christmas and that bike isn't there. I mean, this is something that if he fails on this campaign promise, it's really tough.

At the same time, when people are so literal with the wall -- I mean he also said -- remember every time he said the big beautiful wall, he said with a giant beautiful door in the middle, like, do you really think there's going to be a giant door in the middle? I don't think it's quite as literal. Like a giant -- it's going to swing open --

FRANCIS: A giant brass knob on the big door and you open it up and you follow through?

GUTFELD: There's going to be a doggie door too for Jasper.

FRANCIS: I don't think it's quite as literal, but I agree with Greg that if it doesn't happen, yikes.

BOLLING: I think it's literal. I think he means what he says.

FRANCIS: With a big door? Is there a knocker?

BOLLING: No, no, no. I think he will build a wall. I mean, this is a brilliant idea. Not only to fulfill a campaign promise, but it also -- it's a massive infrastructure. You want to talk about trade and --

BOLLING: It's a massive infrastructure program that you could put a lot of people to work. And like he said, they're putting ways to make Mexico pay for it. Can we be a little (inaudible) down (inaudible). Here's an interesting opportunity for Andy Puzder to do something that Republicans haven't been able to do or aren't willing to do -- is to go after the companies who employ illegals as well.

BOLLING: Not only deport illegals when you catch them or put the wall up, but if a company like a fast food restaurant is employing illegal aliens, you penalize them. You make them pay for that. Now, this has not been a very conservative talking point, but I think Andy Puzder is the guy. If he is going do it, boy, this would be an opportunity to do it.

GUILFOYLE: Pretty exciting. OK, Juan, are you recovering from Bolling's comments yet?

WILLIAMS: Well, I just think -- I really appreciate that you shouldn't take him literally on the wall. There might be a door. I think he said in some areas there might be a fence. We'll get to it. I mean, I just think, look, this is a waste of money, waste of time. If you're looking for jobs, Eric, there's so much that we need in terms of infrastructure in the country.

I would hope that we can do other more meaningful projects. But what concerns me, Kimberly, the demonization of all illegal aliens because of the crimes committed by this one man. He has been deported several times. I think the case that Bill O'Reilly talks about all the time in San Francisco is even a better example because that guy just freshly got out of jail.

But you can't, it seems to me, connect crime and illegal immigrants in any significant way because, in fact, crime has gone down. Violent crime has gone down even when immigration -- illegal immigration is going up.

BOLLING: The incidence of violent crimes is higher among the illegal --

WILLIAMS: That's not true. That's absolutely not true.

BOLLING: According to the FBI in --

WILLIAMS: No, no. What the FBI says is you have more illegal immigrant -- I think its 37 percent illegal immigrants in jail.

WILLIAMS: But you know why they're in jail, Eric? Not violent crime. They're in for immigration violations.

BOLLING: They commit crimes at a higher rate than the population.

GUILFOYLE: No, no, no. They are not in there for immigration violations.

GUTFELD: You know what amazes me? Can you show the picture of the guy?

GUTFELD: What drives me crazy, if you take a look at this fellow, illegal alien deported eight times is well fed. He's just well fed. I mean, if this is how our country operates. He has been deported eight times. That's once every six weeks. He gets deported more times than I get a haircut.

For him it's like running a 5k if he actually exercised. So the problem here isn't just that he's an illegal alien. It's that there are no consequences for the incompetence or the supervisory incompetence. It may not be the officers.

And maybe that they're told not to stop this, and if they're told not to stop that, that has to be addressed. There has to be a punishment for the incompetence so that this doesn't happen.

BOLLING: They are told not to stop this. They are sanctuary city.

GUILFOYLE: It is. It's a hundred percent to -- I'm telling you. I lived there. I worked there. I rented (ph) there and I'm telling you that you'd go in as a prosecutor into court and you would be the bad guy.

The prosecutor of the White House is a bad guy because he would ask the person on the other side of the table there to please identify yourself by your true name. And they would give you about 16 different aliases, lie about everything. You'd have to run them through the print system. Find out they have a hold.

And then the public defender would just try to get them out and then specifically not turn them over to ICE so they can come back into my courtroom again with another DUI or another criminal offense. They are not in the criminal system for an immigration violation, trust me.

WILLIAMS: There's any and every community which you can find criminality. But let me just say, speaking for big business -- can you imagine me speaking for big business? Big business, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Mike Bloomberg -- so many of the big corporations from Disney to Marriott (ph) are all saying that if Donald Trump goes ahead with this deportation force, it will devastate the American economy.

GUTFEDLD: OK, but we're talking about the specific examples of criminality and whether the criminality is worse or better among illegal aliens. If you have that person deported, that crime is committed, you should start calling him the deportables.

GUILFYLE: And here we go.

GUILFOYLE: And just on a quick programming note here, we're unclear as to why that individual looks well fed. He also could have a thyroid issue.

GUTFELD: Oh, we'll treat that. We'll treat that coming up.

GUILFOYLE: Directly ahead, Hillary Clinton takes aim at fake news. It's her warning about spreading false information. Legitimate or just an excuse for losing the election? Details, next.

WILLIAMS: Welcome back. In her first speech since losing the election, Hillary Clinton is sounding the alarm about the dangers of so-called fake news. This comes after online conspiracy stories involving her campaign sparked some violence.

HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Fake news can have real world consequences. This isn't about politics or partisanship. Lives are at risk. Lives of ordinary people just trying to go about their days to do their jobs. It's imperative that leaders in both the private sector and the public sector step up to protect our democracy and innocent lives.

WILLIAMS: With recent incidents like the Pizzagate incident in Washington, D.C. and most recently in Brooklyn, New York, does Clinton have a point? Greg, I want to go to you on this because it's not only Hillary Clinton. I mean several people are increasingly talking about this danger, even the Pope is saying this is --

GUTFELD: All right, first of all, this is a real story. Forget Hillary. We don't need to hear from her on this because I don't trust anything she says. Fox News should be talking about this because this is about news and this is a serious, serious problem. The poison of Pizzagate is that it shifted the burden of proof on to the accused.

If somebody calls you a child molester, it's up to them to provide the proof. They can't call you -- then you're returning to the Salem witch trials where you take a witch and you throw in the water, and if she drowns, she's not a witch. That's the mentality we are dealing with on the internet.

We now have parents of Sandy Hook children getting phone calls and death threats from people because they believe that Sandy Hook is a false flag operation. There has -- we are returning to the McMartin preschool era where you just say somebody is a pedophile and you ruin their lives. There has to be consequences for any of these people. You get -- the FBI should investigating these people and they should be sued for slander and libel. Do whatever is possible.

These small businesses that are being abused by these weirdos, they need to be able to have some action, some action to get back at this. I don't think Hillary helps because she politicizes this.

WILLIAMS: She has a legitimate right to --

GUTFELD: Fox News should be talking about this, not Hillary.

WILLIAMS: I agree with you, but you know, you have people who tweet us stuff like, until this story is proven false, it's a story.

WILLIAMS: That's crazy. That's what you are saying. Melissa, let me come to you. I read a story the other day that indicated this is not just a problem because, you know, some guy takes a gun into a Ping Pong Pizza in D.C., but it's a problem because people who are just trying to know what's going on in the world get confused and they no longer know what's trustworthy. It distorts the entire world of news.

FRANCIS: I guess. But I mean, what's the remedy? How do you police something like this? I mean, I understand the extreme example. But it's like, with people putting out stories, you need some common sense.

I mean, I feel like, when somebody is sharing a story that's ludicrous, I don't just believe it based on that somebody forwarded it in their Twitter or they booked it in their Facebook. I think they're a moron. You know I mean? You watch it and you look at it, and you're like, this can't possibly be true. Why -- why would I believe it? I mean, I just...

GUTFELD: There's an entire group of people who are pushing a story, pushing a pernicious, toxic story that are hurting people. There should be some retribution.

WILLIAMS: So Eric, let me come to you on this point. In the story that I read, it said there are lots of people, particularly on the right -- and I've heard this from Greg -- who take delight in the idea that there's someone picking on the liberals, someone who's saying they're up to nasty stuff, and so what if it's a little not true? They're still punching back at the left.

BOLLING: This is a big, big problem. And I think the only solution is Greg is right, have the legitimate news services get out in front of it and talk about it. And I'll tell you what it does do. It drives people to FOX News, CNN, ABC, NBC and stop reading these things that randomly pop up.

The problem is, some of them look like us. Some of them...

BOLLING: ... are putting logos that look a lot like...

BOLLING: ... our logos. Of course. But again, free speech, I get it. But when you're infringing on copyright -- there's also another issue, too. When you're a public figure, I think you forego your rights of being -- of suing for libel and slander. So when you're hitting Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton has some sort of pedophilia thing going on with the pizza - - pizza place in D.C., she doesn't really -- she's not covered under the law. But the average citizen is.

BOLLING: The pizza guy is. He's not a public figure yet, and so he should be.

BOLLING: Who do you sue?

GUTFELD: You have to get the names of the -- they found -- they found one woman who was behind the Pizzagate story who published it on her website, finally.

BOLLING: Sue the Internet provider that hosts the story, not the person that posts it. Or both.

FRANCIS: I mean, I -- I agree with the sentiment of what you're saying.

GUTFELD: Like shouting ""fire"" in a theater. Right?

FRANCIS: It's -- but it's -- realistically, how do you deal with this? I mean, so then you go after the Internet provider. I mean, that's...

WILLIAMS: It's terrible. Let me -- let me...

FRANCIS: Then they've got to police everything that's going on all over the Internet?

WILLIAMS: I want to talk to...

WILLIAMS: I want to talk to Ms. Guilfoyle, the lawyer, if you'll allow me.

GUILFOYLE: Yes, the lawyer. Twenty seconds, the lawyer.

Please. Go to a real lawyer. Not a fake lawyer.

WILLIAMS: Will you give Ms. Guilfoyle the table?

WILLIAMS: We -- Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook is now asking Facebook users to help him find fake stories. Google says they're going to stop placing ads. But ""The Wall Street Journal"" reported just today, they said, ""You know what? Fake news is making tens of thousands of dollars because the big companies don't know that their ads are on these sites. The computers are automatically placing these ads. And so they're supporting fake news sites.

GUILFOYLE: Right. Well, obviously, they have to be a little bit more, you know, vigilant about researching and vetting the sites that they're involved with and make sure this doesn't happen. So it has to have a multifaceted approach. Right? You've got to do this thing. It's like Jeff [SIC] Zuckerberg is doing over there at Facebook.

GUILFOYLE: Mark Zuckerberg is doing over there to make sure that they're, in fact, checking it all out. Right? But at the same time, people also use some of their common sense to not be fooled by it.

And on a third note, Hillary Clinton is just trying to continue to make and find excuses for why she lost the election, even though she was a horrible candidate and herself being no stranger to creating fake news stories, like when she lied about Benghazi and said over the caskets of four Americans.

GUTFELD: Or the bullets in -- with getting hit by fire.

WILLIAMS: I won't go into that.

All right. When we come back, new questions about conflicts of interest for President-elect Trump. This time, for his ties to ""Celebrity Apprentice."" Oh, my goodness. Details coming up next.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A lot of times it falls on the project managers. But, you know, I did come up with the jingle, but I want to stay here. I want to win.

DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: OK. But you wrote the jingle?

FRANCIS: President-elect Donald Trump will not be firing anyone else from NBC's ""Celebrity Apprentice."" In fact, Mr. Trump is keeping his title as executive producer of the reality show after he takes office. The series is returning after a two-year hiatus, hosted by Arnold Schwarzenegger.

In the meantime, Kellyanne Conway is pushing back against the hypocrisy of critics who are slamming the move as a potential conflict of interest.

KELLYANNE CONWAY, TRUMP SENIOR ADVISOR: Were we so concerned about the hours and hours and hours spent on the golf course of the current president? I mean, presidents have a right to do things in their spare time or their leisure time. I mean, nobody objects to that.

Whether it's President Obama or Donald Trump, the idea that these men are going to be all work and nothing else all the time, it's just unrealistic, because it's never happened in our lifetime.

FRANCIS: Kimberly, what's the potential conflict of interest here? That he's going to suddenly start liking ""SNL,"" because they're on the same network?

GUILFOYLE: There you go. Conflict of interest. He's going to have to all of a sudden think Alec Baldwin is very, very funny.

I mean, yes, I think they're going to check this out legally to make sure that there isn't any impropriety. If there were, then he would have to not have the executive producer title. So so far, I think this is clean. Maybe perhaps it's somewhat unconventional. But it is not, my dear friend, illegal.

FRANCIS: See, I think this is a decoy. This is like the shiny ball that he, you know, holds up in front of the crowd to distract you. Because it doesn't make any sense to be talking about this necessarily. I mean, executive producer, it's like a candy that they give out now to actors when they're not really -- you know, I mean...

BOLLING: That's the point. I don't think many people understand what that means. That doesn't mean he's going to be on the phone going, ""Yes, I want to see this activity going on.""

BOLLING: No. You slap ""executive producer"" on almost everything. Watch a movie. At the end of a movie, when the credits start to roll...

BOLLING: Yes, there's 15. And, you know, most of them are the ones who donated to the film.

So I see nothing wrong with this. It's intellectual property. He developed the show.

GUILFOYLE: One or two.

BOLLING: It was created prior to ever announcing he wanted to run for president.

Barack Obama wrote a book before he was president. If that book was made into a movie, it would be the exact same thing. No one would ask him to take his name off...

WILLIAMS: What happened to the profits from the last book Obama did?

FRANCIS: We don't know he's getting paid for this, though. We don't know he's getting paid.

WILLIAMS: So here's the -- here's the...

WILLIAMS: Well, we do know that he's made millions already.

FRANCIS: Yes, but we don't know he's going to get paid this time.

WILLIAMS: Let me say the problem here -- I'm amazed that you guys don't see the problem of the potential for the chief executive of the United States taking a paycheck not from the American people.

FRANCIS: We don't know he's getting paid.

BOLLING: You don't know that.

WILLIAMS: Or taking credit, having an interest -- Kellyanne Conway says he's going to be spending time on this. I don't think that's legit.

And I think that when you look at the idea that, you know, he stands there and says, you know, ""I have spare time. I'll do this."" What if he says, you know, ""I don't know if I'm going to do an interview with NBC, because I want a better time slot for 'The Apprentice'""? That's a conflict of interest. Isn't it? By definition.

FRANCIS: Greg, aren't you the executive producer of this program?

GUTFELD: Little known fact, yes.

FRANCIS: I had no idea. What is your opinion on this?

GUTFELD: My opinion is, forget conflict of interest. Make it a conflict of interest. You know, if you win ""The Apprentice,"" you get -- your apprenticeship is in government. You get a job on the cabinet. If you lose, you go to Gitmo. And everybody who loses goes to Gitmo, because Gitmo is awesome.

BOLLING: Geraldo's right there. Just when you said that, Geraldo...

GUILFOYLE: Geraldo is going to Gitmo?

GUILFOYLE: Geraldo, thank you for the chocolates.

GUTFELD: ... Newt was on ""Cavuto"" earlier, and I like Newt, because he always says the honest thing. He just goes, ""It's weird."" Didn't he say, like, ""It's weird""? He was like, ""Why would he care? Why would he want it?"" He gets -- he asks everything.

GUILFOYLE: There's a reason behind it.

FRANCIS: I know. That's why I think it's a decoy.

BOLLING: He developed the show. It's near and dear to his heart.

GUILFOYLE: This is his other baby.

BOLLING: His kids were involved in developing the show.

BOLLING: It would be like...

GUILFOYLE: I think he thinks Arnold is going to do well.

BOLLING: ... would you want to take -- would you want to take your book away from you, your name and rights to the book, if you became president.

WILLIAMS: By the way, he's having a news conference next week, I think on next Thursday.

WILLIAMS: Trump is going to have a news conference, which he hasn't done - - hasn't had one since Hillary Clinton.

FRANCIS: He doesn't need to. He won.

WILLIAMS: He shouldn't talk to the American people and the press?

GUTFELD: It's an interesting problem to have. This is the first pop culture president.

GUTFELD: The first president that came directly from entertainment.

GUTFELD: This is a new problem.

GUILFOYLE: So truth in advertising and therefore...

FRANCIS: Greg will be the next one.

FRANCIS: All right. Don't go anywhere. ""Facebook Friday"" is up next.

GUTFELD: Yes. ""Facebook Friday,"" your questions answered. This is a great one. I'm going to start with you, Kimberly, go around.

GUTFELD: From Michelle K.: ""In memory of John Glenn, would any of you want to go to space and why?""

GUTFELD: Nope. Any -- any reason why?

GUILFOYLE: Because it would be really tough to catch all the salami upside down.

GUILFOYLE: Bad hair. I don't know. That kind of scares me a little bit, to be honest.

GUTFELD: Yes. What about you, Juan? I bet you'd go.

WILLIAMS: I'd love to go. You know, I'm curious about this tourism business...

WILLIAMS: ... because it seems a little extreme. But if you really are going to do something, that would be cool. Like, the other day Steven Hawkins said we're going to have to find a new planet in 1,000 years, because we're going to use this one up. Especially with Trump as president, doing away with the EPA.

GUTFELD: Way to work that in there.

WILLIAMS: So I would, yes. But the other reason is because I love movies. Right?

WILLIAMS: So I think Sigourney Weaver's probably up there with the aliens. Right? And Jodi Foster, didn't she do ""Contact""?

WILLIAMS: Yes, so I would like -- there's nice people in space.

GUTFELD: I don't think Jodi would be into you, though.

BOLLING: I don't think so either.

So apparently, Elon Musk says in 10 years, he'll have a space station...

BOLLING: ... up on the moon to go visit. I would like to. But you know what I would rather do?

BOLLING: I'd rather be Speed Racer. I would -- Spritle and Chim-Chim and racing Racer X in the Mach 5 when it would leap canyons.

GUTFELD: It would. It was pretty impressive.

BOLLING: I want to be Speed Racer.

WILLIAMS: I think we saw the child in you. That's wonderful.

FRANCIS: I am officially terrified. I would rather lay on the beach.

FRANCIS: Would you join me laying on the beach? We can do that together. Nice sand...

GUTFELD: But -- but that's the beauty. If you lay on the beach, technically you are in space. We are on a spaceship, Earth. We are throating in space.

GUTFELD: We are flying through space right now. Probably in a tiny spaceship, compared to a lot of other ones. The other issue is pooping.

GUTFELD: Not having that. I don't know how you do that in space. I mean, think about the problems.

GUTFELD: People have thought about it. How do you -- you know, things happen. It's floating over there. You know, all of a sudden it's up over there. You've got to chase it.

BOLLING: He's right. It's an issue.

GUILFOYLE: How did this happen?

GUTFELD: All right. Now we're going to go this way.

GUTFELD: From Robert G., when -- great question. ""When growing up,"" Melissa -- when you were growing up -- ""which celebrity posters or pictures did you have hanging on your wall?""

GUILFOYLE: Her own. Her own. ""Little House on the Prairie.""

GUTFELD: They didn't have posters of ""Little House on the Prairie."" Come on.

GUTFELD: Any of the Cassidys.

FRANCIS: OK, yes, any of the Cassidys.

GUTFELD: He still looks the same.

FRANCIS: I had all kinds of Billy Idol going on in my room. Every single poster. It was a little frightening for my parents. And these tiny little buttons that you put...

GUTFELD: Were you dancing with yourself?

FRANCIS: I'd put them on my teddy bear, which is, like, a kind of mixed up, scary thing.

BOLLING: ... which a lot of guys did. But my mom let me have it. But it had to be in the closet. It wasn't allowed to be on the walls. It was in the closet.

GUILFOYLE: And then you married Adrienne, much better looking.

BOLLING: Don't talk about coming in or out of the closet with that one. But I was a huge, huge Rolling Stones and Aerosmith fan. So anything Stones or Aerosmith went up on my walls.

BOLLING: Or The Who.

GUTFELD: What about you?

WILLIAMS: You know, I -- you know, my dad is involved with boxing. I love boxing, so it's odd characters like Alfredo Benitez, who was just a great boxer. But Ali. You know, I just like boxers.

GUILFOYLE: Yes, yes. One time I got this magazine. It was, like, ""Teen Beat"" or something.

GUILFOYLE: Yes, maybe that was it. And it had a free poster in there.

FRANCIS: Of course. And so I was like, OK. And I put it up. And then I put it up, and that was that. And it was nice. And then I eventually got to meet him. And then...

FRANCIS: Were you disappointed or happy?

GUILFOYLE: No, I was quite happy. And he sang to me. He has a beautiful voice.

GUTFELD: Wow. I used to have -- I used to have posters...

GUTFELD: ... of Lancelot Link, which was a money dressed as a detective. But I had posters underneath it. So that was the whole key. Is we always had posters that hid other posters so your parents never knew what you were really looking at.

GUILFOYLE: And what posters do you have, now?

FRANCIS: No, no. Don't ask that.

GUTFELD: I don't think you want to know.

All right. Start with you, Eric. From Cindy E., ""What did you want to be when you grew up?""

BOLLING: It's true. That's all I got for you.

GUTFELD: Quickly, Juan, what did you want to be when you grew up?

GUTFELD: A journalist? Wow, you were an exciting kid. Yes.

GUILFOYLE: Well, I wanted to be a prosecutor, and I did that. And then I decided, OK, I want to work in television. I did that. And now I decided I wanted do something else, and I'm going to do that.

FRANCIS: What was the other thing? Wait, can we come back to that?

GUTFELD: Well, we know. It's mayor of New York.

BOLLING: Is it? Or is it something else?

FRANCIS: What is it?

GUILFOYLE: Greg wants to write all of my mayoral speeches.

GUILFOYLE: No, but Bo Dietl's running for mayor.

GUTFELD: Oh, that -- is that -- really?

BOLLING: That's true. That is true.

GUTFELD: That's going to be -- that's going to be amazing.

WILLIAMS: And he told me he's running as a Democrat.

GUTFELD: That's the only thing you can do.

When you were a child, you already had a job.

FRANCIS: I was an actress, so I wanted to be everything. I was going to be a president and an actress and also a doctor. So I would, like, slip out to do an episode of ""Knots Landing"" and then, you know, go see some patients and then come back and protect the free world. I was going to just do it all at once.

GUTFELD: I would dress up as you often. You know, that still hasn't stopped.

FRANCIS: I do that now.

GUTFELD: One day I will be you. I will wear your skin, Kimberly. That's from ""Silence of the Lambs.""

BOLLING: You better be nice.

WILLIAMS: That's exactly what I thought.

GUILFOYLE: You're so Hannibal Lecter. You know that?

All right. ""One More Thing"" is up next.

BOLLING: All right. Time for ""One More Thing."" Juan is first -- Juan.

WILLIAMS: Today one of Hollywood's greats turned 100. The dimpled and macho, guess who? Kirk Douglas.

KIRK DOUGLAS, ACTOR: A free man dies, he loses the pleasure of life. A slave loses his pain. Death is the only freedom a slave knows. That's why he's not afraid of it. That's why we all win.

WILLIAMS: People remember Douglas as the star of ""Spartacus."" But he was also in other classics, like ""Lust for Life"" and ""Paths for Glory.""

He's been with his wife, Anne, now for over 60 years. And he's still making appearances with his son and fellow actor, of course, Michael Douglas.

Happy birthday to you, sir. You are a joy.

WILLIAMS: Also, I want to send a quick shout-out to one of our fans here at ""The Five,"" Dr. Jerry Den Herder. Dr. Den Herder had a stroke this week, but he's such a big fan of ""The Five,"" check this out, Gregory. The first thing he did in the hospital, he demanded that the nurse switch the TV to FOX News so he could watch ""The Five,"" Eric. ""The Five."" Best wishes for a speedy recovery to Dr. Den Herder.

GUILFOYLE: I know. OK, so, time for...

GUILFOYLE: I love it. I love it. So -- Greg, please.

So Madame Tussauds in London has unveiled a special version of the royals wax figures this week, featuring each member in a Christmas sweater. Greg, look at how cute. Four real-life Corgis joined the photo shoot. The queen is a big fan and is wearing a little Corgi sweater. How adorable is that?

GUILFOYLE: This is not your turn, Greg. The royals actually granted permission for it as part of U.K. charity, Save the Children. Do you care now, Greg?

GUILFOYLE: Christmas Jumpers, a campaign. It starts on December 16 and encourages people to throw on their festive knits that day and donate to the cause. You can wear one of your unicorn sweaters.

GUTFELD: All right, then.

BOLLING: All righty. So tonight, make sure you tune in. Big ""O'Reilly Factor."" Donald Trump is going to go to Lansing, Michigan, and talk to them on the thank-you tour. You've got to stay tuned, because part of that will probably go into that hour.

But then Rudy Giuliani is going to join me to talk about exactly what we're talking about earlier. First time on camera, actually, talking about the secretary of state pick. And we'll figure out...

GUILFOYLE: And where he'll be this weekend at the -- right? -- Army-Navy game with the president-elect.

BOLLING: At the -- at the football game, Army-Navy football game.

GUTFELD: I said it. I've got Ambassador Bolton. We're going to hopefully talk to him about what's going on in that mustache of his. Erin McPike. We've got Kat Timpf. And Tyrus, a new employee of FOX News.

BOLLING: Oh, is he? Made a contributor?

GUILFOYLE: Yes, and by the way...

BOLLING: Do you think I could take him?

3,538,"It was ten years ago today since the infamous Pizzagate incident marked the end of Arsenal's 49-game unbeaten run.

Cesc Fabregas allegedly threw a slice of pizza at Sir Alex Ferguson, landing on his face before sliding down his suit to the floor, in part of a full-time tunnel bust-up.

It all started when Ruud van Nistelrooy complained to Ferguson that Arsene Wenger had been giving him stick throughout the game - thus leading to a furious Fergie confronting the French boss.

But nobody could have predicted what happened next.

""All eyes turned and all mouths gawped to see this pizza slip off that famous puce face and roll down his nice black suit,"" is how Andy Cole described the debacle in his autobiography.

The ""Battle of the Buffet"" also reportedly had soup and sandwiches launched from team-to-team, as the Premier League's marquee fixture of the season descended into a school-like food fight.

But where are all the players from Pizzagate now? Here is where you can find them all...

The Northern Ireland stopper turned out 49 times for Manchester United in the Premier League, before departing Old Trafford in 2005 to become a textbook football journeyman, having spent time at - deep breath - West Ham, Rangers, Derby, Odense BK, OFI Crete and Olympiacos. He can currently be found between the sticks at Notts County.

G-Nev hung up his boots in 2011 having racked up 602 appearances for United and now whiles away his days either arguing with Jamie Carragher on Sky Sports or putting the cones out for Roy Hodgson.

The ex-England defender called time on his trophy-laden Old Trafford career this summer, with a number of offers apparently sent his way. After much deliberation, he joined Harry Redknapp at QPR but has struggled for form since arriving at Loftus Road.

After departing United in 2008, the Frenchman joined rivals Arsenal on a free transfer. A couple of years at the Emirates followed before spells in Germany and the MLS. Silvestre has recently agreed a deal with Chennaiyin FC in the new Indian Super League.

The defender left Manchester for Madrid in 2007 before joining Marseille and then Roma. Heinze's career ended where it began, in his native Argentina with Newell's Old Boys, when he hung up his boots this summer.

Last spotted terrorising Liverpool at Anfield. The Portuguese has taken his game to another level since leaving Old Trafford. At Real Madrid, Ronaldo has smashed almost every goal record in sight alongside his impressive trophy haul. His sumptuous goal against Liverpool took him within one of Raul's Champions League tally.

United's go-to guy on the big occasions swapped United for Everton in 2005, where he captained the Toffees before retiring in 2013. That summer he followed boss David Moyes to Old Trafford as the Scot's first-team coach but departed after the ill-fated reign. Neville is now regularly found challenging his brother's punditry skills on Match of the Day.

The Red Devils' most successful player ever remains a firm part of the club's furniture. Following Moyes' reign, Giggs took temporary charge for the remainder of the season. Louis van Gaal's arrival saw the Welshman appointed assistant boss and marked the end of his illustrious career. Just the 963 appearances.

Rooney celebrated his 19th birthday in style 10 years ago by scoring the second goal. Plenty more have followed, along with controversies, with the England man taking the United armband this summer. He needs 30 goals to become the club's all-time top goalscorer.

The other scorer on that wet Old Trafford afternoon, Van Nistelrooy hung up his boots in 2012. After leaving the club, the Dutchman enjoyed spells at Real Madrid, Hamburg and Malaga and is now the assistant boss to Gus Hiddink with the Holland national team.

After never really making the grade at United, Howard moved to Everton on loan in 2006. That deal was made permanent the following summer and the American has remained on Merseyside ever since. Still one of the top goalkeepers in the Premier League.

After over 200 apperances, Brown bid farewell to his boyhood club in 2011 to join Sunderland. His tenure at the Stadium of Light has been ruined by injuries but he played a key role in the club's survival push last season.

United were so desperate to land Miller, they sealed a pre-contract agreement in January 2004 before taking him to Old Trafford that summer. Just nine league appearances followed before spells at Sunderland, QPR and Hibs. The Irishman can now be found at Brisbane Roar in the Australian A-league.

The Frenchman never lived up to the £12.4million United coughed up for him in 2004 as injuries hindered his progress. It was a similar story at Everton for Saha, although he did break the record for the earliest goal in an FA Cup final. Short-term deals at Spurs and Lazio followed before retirement in 2013.

Like Saha, Smith's time with the Red Devils was also dogged by injury woes. The ex-England man never really recovered from a leg break in the FA Cup at Liverpool and joined Newcastle in 2007. Smith managed just over 80 appearances in five years in the north east before moving to MK Dons. He is now plying his trade with Notts County in League One.

Now 44, the former German international stayed with the Gunners until 2008, making 199 appearances during that time. The mad-cap keeper moved on to VFB Stuttgart until 2010, when he returned to the Emirates Stadium, coming out of retirement to help the club amid a goalkeeper's injury crisis. Now often seen on Sky Germany's Bundesliga and Champions League coverage.

Rated by Arsene Wenger as one of his best ever signings, the Cameroonian left Arsenal in 2006 to join Portsmouth in their boom-to-bust years. However, he spent much of his time at Fratton Park as second-choice and eventually left in 2009. His final playing days came in Spain at Cordoba in 2010, after which he retired.

The 73-cap England defender left the Gunners after the 2006 Champions League Final - in which he scored - before spending time with Portsmouth, Notts County, Arsenal again and Newcastle. Released by the club in May 2011, he announced his retirement a year later.

The Ivorian defender remained in north London until a £16million move to Manchester City in 2009, having made 326 appearances for the Gunners. 103 appearances for City followed - as well as a Premier League winners' medal - before he joined Liverpool on a free transfer in 2013. Aged 33, he's still at Anfield.

After almost swerving off the road after only being offered £55,000-a-week, Cole left Arsenal to join Chelsea in 2006. In eight years he won a third Premier League, a seventh FA Cup (a record) and got his hands on both the Champions League and Europa League before leaving on a free transfer in 2014 to join AS Roma in Italy.

Now 37, Ljungberg has taken his footballing talents on something of a global tour since leaving Arsenal in 2007. West Ham, Seattle Sounders, Chicago Fire, Celtic, Shimizu S-Pulse and now Mumbai City - who he joined in 2014, two years after retirement - have all been called home by the Swede.

The Invincibles' captain, Vieira left Arsenal for Juventus in 2005 and took in Inter Milan and Manchester City before retirement in 2011. Now 38, the Frenchman still works for City, working as the reserve-team manager, having previously been the club's Football Development Executive.

The languid midfielder had a wonderful left-foot and was a key member of the Gunners squad during their best years - although not always necessarily as a starter. Left Arsenal in 2005 to join Valencia, before returning to his homeland in 2009 with Corinthians, where he is now director of football.

Signed for £17million from Sevilla in January 2003, the Spanish international showed glimpses of his talent at Arsenal, but never produced his best often enough. Joined Real Madrid on loan in 2006, where he won the Spanish title, before joining Atletico permanently the following year. Now back with Sevilla, with whom he won the Europa League (for the third time in his career) last season.

After 423 games and 120 goals for the Gunners, the Dutchman retired in 2006. Gone but never forgotten, a statue of the iconic No.10 was unveiled outside the Emirates in 2014. Bergkamp is currently back at first love Ajax, working as assistant manager to Frank de Boer.

Arsenal's greatest-ever goalscorer, in two spells with the club Henry struck 228 goals in 376 matches, while he also became France's record-scorer with 51 in 123 games for Les Bleus. Joined Barcelona in 2007 and conquered Europe, he has spent the last four years in MLS with New York Red Bulls. Expected to retire in November.

After making 18 appearances for the Gunners, his career never really kicked on after that. He has only made 62 appearances since his career began in 1997 - and that spans across 11 clubs. After spending three years at Manchester City from 2009 to 2012 without taking to the pitch once, he is now at Leeds United... and has again not made an apperance.

He was a mainstay in the Arsenal Invincible line-up but was soon moved on from the club once the unbeaten run came to an end. After featuring for a short period for Villarreal, the Frenchman signed for newly-promoted Italian second division side Cartagena before calling it a day. Now 40, he has no involvement in the game.

Arguably one of Arsenal's best players during the Invincibles period, Pires scored of average one in every three games from the centre of midfield. He is currently playing the Indian Super League for FC Goa, where he was recently reportedly punched in the face by an opposing coach. It is his first club in three years, after departing Aston Villa in 2011.

Well, this career got off to a dramatic start, didn't it. Reportedly the one to throw the pizza at Ferguson, Fabregas enjoyed his name in more glittering lights later in his career. Transferred to Barcelona in 2011, he has recently returned to England for city rivals Chelsea, where he has notched up an incredible nine assists already this season.

The Dutchman made the controversial switch from Arsenal to Manchester United in 2012 and continued his fine goalscoring form. He now has 40 goals in 65 appearances for the Red Devils. Now at 31-years-old, he has been entrusted with leading the line for United and Louis van Gaal's new-look front-line.",mainstream,M1a13a,pizzagate
4,192,"The son of Donald Trump’s pick for national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has lost his job in the president-elect’s transition team after he spread a false conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton that led to shots being fired in pizza restaurant.

While working for his father, Michael Flynn Jr tweeted an erroneous theory that Clinton’s allies had been running a paedophile ring in the Comet Ping Pong pizza parlour in Washington.

Even after a man on Sunday fired a rifle in the restaurant, in an incident apparently sparked by the conspiracy theory, Flynn said on Twitter that the fake news would “remain a story” until proven false.

The incident has heightened concerns about the incoming administration’s fondness for fake news and raised further questions about the suitability of Flynn Sr, who has also shared bogus stories on social media.

Mike Pence, the vice-president-elect, initially denied that Flynn’s son was working for the troubled Trump transition team. But on Tuesday he admitted on CNN that Flynn Jr had been helping his father, but that was “no longer the case”.

The New York Times reported that Flynn Jr had planned to work for his father as part of the national security council team, and started the process of getting national security clearance.

Since the election the Twitter postings of Flynn Sr have been uncontroversial. But days before the vote he tweeted a “must read” link to a story falsely claiming that Clinton’s emails contained proof of money-laundering and child abuse.

Flynn also promoted conspiracy theorists throughout the campaign. He encouraged his followers to read a book by Mike Cernovich, whose website has suggested Clinton’s campaign chairman was part of a “sex cult with connections to human trafficking”. Flynn also tagged white nationalist Jared Wyand on social media.

Speaking to the the New York Times, Michael Hayden, the former CIA and National Security Agency director, said: “The national security adviser should have a moderating effect on the instincts of the president, and it remains to be seen if Mike can do that.”

Julianne Smith, a former deputy national security adviser to the vice-president, Joe Biden, said she was deeply troubled by Flynn’s tendency to promote fake news. She told the Associated Press his job would be to “ensure that the White House is focused at all times on all of the threats that the United States faces abroad”.

Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Flynn’s willingness to promote fake news “raises profound questions about his suitability for this important position”.

Tom Nichols, a professor at the US Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, where Flynn obtained a master’s degree in national security and strategic studies in 2001, said: “If the national security adviser is going to be the direct conduit between the president and the national security world, of course it’s a concern that that adviser is being taken in by conspiracy theories and fake news.”",mainstream,M16b69,pizzagate

Bullshit, James Ball tells me, can get you into the Oval Office.

The former Guardian journalist and now special correspondent at BuzzFeed is well versed in separating fact from fiction.As a young reporter fresh out of university he started as an intern at WikiLeaks, working on the verification and publication of confidential US documents in 2010, and then on the Snowden leaks in 2013 during his time at The Guardian.

That’s all to say he’s developed a sixth sense for what is, and isn’t, bullshit.

With this in mind, today Ball is publishing his debut book as a solo author on the fake news phenomenon which has engulfed the world of politics over the last year.

We sat down with Ball to find out how half-truths, untruths and outright fakery took over:

Fake news, post-truths and bullshit, is this a new phenomenon?

This definitely isn't new: newspapers have run questionable stories for as long as they've existed, and fake news has circulated the web for just as long.

But things have changed a bit – fake news got political last year, because that was the way to get huge audiences.

So it's some old trends that have suddenly really come to the fore.



So who's to blame for fake news?

Russia! More seriously – all of us.

Fake news is just the most visible bit of what is a whole ecosystem of half-truths, untruths and outright fakery, or in other words, of bullshit.

When we share a story without thinking about it or checking, we're part of that system. When a hyper-partisan news site (think Breitbart or The Canary) over-hypes and spins a kernel of truth into something much bigger, that's part of it.

When mainstream outlets run too-good-to-check stories, they're part of it. And when Facebook and others profit off this whole system, they're part of it too.

Are there examples of fake news causing real harm?

The Pizzagate conspiracy – an alt-right theory that pizza parlours were harbouring secret child abuse sites used by leading democrats – led to an armed man storming a DC pizza parlour.

So the consequences of this stuff can be very real.

Polling shows Republicans believe Obama wiretapped Trump (there's no evidence he did), while many Democrats believe US election machines themselves were hacked (there's no evidence of this either).

When we all believe different facts, we can't have a public conversation – we can only have a shouting match.

So what's the solution? Will we ever be free of fake news?

The upside of all of us being part of the problem is that we can all be part of the solution.

We need to find ways to make corrections reach as many people as the initial bad reports and hoaxes do. We've got to find new ways to cover politicians and campaigns which deploy bullshit to win. There's no one big fix, but there's lots of little things all of us can do.

The fightback can start whenever we like.

6,427,"I am republishing this post from July 27, 2010 in view of Pizzagate, which gives this post a new significance.

 When you read this post, just remember that a pedophile is defined as an adult with “sexual fondness for and activity” with children, i.e., minors below the age of consent. In other words, the definition doesn’t require that there be sexual abuse of a child; sexual attraction to children is definitive. That in turn means that the Pentagon employees busted for child porn are pedophiles.

 

 Remember the news back in April 2010 that, while the economy crashed, senior staffers at the federal government’s Securities and Exchange Commission were spending hours surfing pornographic websites on government-issued computers while they were being paid to police the financial system?

 Now comes news that employees and contractors of the Pentagon are buying and watching child porn on the taxpayers’ dime. Not only is porn-watching on government computers illegal, it is against the law for all Americans to purchase and view child pornography. Worse still, some of the Pentagon child porn creeps have high-level security clearances, which makes them national security hazards because their sexual perversion makes them vulnerable to blackmail.

 On July 23, 2010, Dana Hedgpeth of the Washington Post reports that “Federal investigators have identified about 20 Pentagon employees and contractors accused of buying and downloading online child pornography and in some cases used their government-issued computers to view the illegal material.”

 According to a 94-page report released by the Defense Department’s inspector general’s office, some of those involved possessed top-secret security clearances and worked for such divisions as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Security Agency (NSA) and the National Reconnaissance Office. Those agencies deal with some of the government’s most sensitive intelligence and defense work.

 The number of Pentagon employees investigated was not disclosed in the report, but a Pentagon spokeswoman said the probe involved about 20 people who had an “affiliation with the Defense Department” as full-time employees, former military members or contractors. Some of those people have been prosecuted, and some of their cases were dropped for lack of evidence. Other cases remain open.

 The cases are part of a wider probe, Operation Flicker, which was started by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement four years ago and which has identified more than 5,000 people who subscribed to online child pornography websites.

 The cases detailed in the new report include one involving an employee of Oracle Corp. who had a top-secret clearance and worked on a contract for the National Security Agency. The man subscribed to various child pornography websites and made 21 purchases. After authorities started investigating him, the report said, he attempted to tamper with computers at his office. He was put on administrative leave with pay. He later fled to Libya but was arrested and extradited to the United States.

 Another case involved a government employee at the National Defense University in Norfolk who made two purchases from a child pornography website. He pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography and was sentenced to five years in prison.

 It is illegal to access pornography with a government computer.

Five years later, the Boston Globe discovered the Pentagon still had not investigated as many as 1,700 of the cases involving employees suspected of child-porn.

7,591,"Picture adult engagement with information as a continuum. On one side sits intentional (or actively sought) information, and on the other lives seemingly incidental (or passively received) information (see Figure 1). In this section, we address the two ends of this continuum and then discuss the space in between.

Our continuum is based entirely on work in schools and with teachers; however, a reviewer of earlier drafts of this article pointed us to Ross's (1999) concept of finding without seeking, which led us to Williamson's (1998) article, which distinguished incidental information acquisition from purposeful information seeking. These older studies serve to remind us that the concepts employed here are not new, although the ubiquity, speed, and scale of information encountered in the age of the internet is.

Educators need to address these challenges, but where are they to begin? As part of the SHEG ( 2016 ) study, the researchers compared the way students approached judging credibility with the way professional fact‐checkers approached the same tasks (Wineburg & McGrew, 2016 ). This is an interesting and important line of research, partly because it compares various kinds of readers and reading purposes and partly because it grows from an authentic example of adult interaction with text. We also see value in exploring the relation between identity and information seeking (Kohnen, in press ) and wonder how schools might design learning environments where students not only learn fact‐checking skills but also learn to value facts.

The utility of the rules for internet searching that are currently and commonly taught is suspect given the range of topics likely addressed in the upper left quadrant of Figure 2 . When querying settled issues that are uncontroversial, the rules may make some sense. However, the issues that fall into the upper left quadrant are often those that are most controversial or otherwise unsettled. The more current the question is, the less likely one is to find peer‐reviewed research on it; library scientists have described this as the information cycle. Navigating the digital floodwaters is perhaps most treacherous when users are in unsettled territory, but if educators are to prepare students for authentic, intentional searching, isn't it their responsibility to help students gather information about unsettled topics?

The high‐stakes searches should be a high priority for schools, but the small amount of information‐seeking instruction currently occurring appears to be almost exclusively focused on preparing students for searches that fall into the upper right quadrant of Figure 2 . Clearly, students should be exposed to what it means to search like an expert and should learn to use specific websites that historians, scientists, literary critics, or mathematicians find highly credible. Yet, should this be the only kind of information‐seeking instruction that students receive? After all, the upper left quadrant of Figure 2 (“highly important/low preparation”) is a place where we will all find ourselves at one point or another in our lives. Questions related to citizenship, personal finance, health, and consumer decisions may all fall into this quadrant.

Again, based on surveys and conversations with adults of all ages, we conclude that most people engage in intentional information seeking of all kinds at one point or another. Examples from Angela's perspective are included in Figure 2 for illustrative purposes, and we have invited dozens of adults to think about their recent information‐seeking endeavors in these terms. We hope that this graphic will help start a conversation about what it means to prepare students to be successful in different kinds of searches. In all likelihood, educators will see the low‐stakes searches as a low priority for schools; perhaps teachers might model via a search‐aloud (Saul, Kohnen, Newman, & Pearce, 2012 ) how they engage in low‐stakes searches of different kinds, but otherwise these kinds of searches probably demand little curricular space.

However, the internet‐searching rules imposed by many teachers do little to prepare students for the daily information needs of adults, needs that are not primarily academic or even career in nature. In fact, the banned resources are the bedrock of many of the searches that adults engage in as parents, moviegoers, hobbyists, and so forth (for more on Wikipedia, see Alvermann, 2017 ). We propose thinking about these needs in terms of two variables: importance (Is the information need high or low stakes?) and preparation (How well has your education and/or experience prepared you to deal with the information you find?; see Figure 2 ).

Searches undertaken in schools appear to be designed to help students succeed in formal academic environments. If the goal of schools is to prepare students to succeed as academics in training, it might make sense to ban Wikipedia; after all, academics do not usually cite tertiary sources such as Wikipedia in their formal writing. Likewise, perhaps teachers privilege .gov and .edu domain names because they associate these domains with an editorial process, and some teachers may encourage students to go to the databases in an attempt to steer them toward peer‐reviewed resources.

It appears that most teachers recognize how difficult navigating the digital floodwaters is for students and believe that rules are needed as basic signposts or clues. Yet, these rules do not teach students to assess the credibility of online information as a nuanced or critical thinking activity. Instead, these inflexible rules mask differences between websites that may have a similar domain name or the same suffix; do not account for the various kinds of information that exist online (e.g., blogs, newspapers, magazines, commercial product sites, professional and amateur videos); and privilege academic searches over other kinds of information seeking, as we discuss next.

Since 2009, we have been collecting survey, focus group, and interview data on the ways that students are being taught to access information online. We have also talked informally with teachers as part of other projects that take us into schools. Our respondents came from urban, suburban, and rural upper elementary, middle, and high school classrooms (grades 4–12) in schools in the U.S. Midwest and Southeast. We also discussed internet searching with a group of college students at a highly selective university (see Kohnen & Saul, 2017 ). Based on several hundred responses, the following trends became apparent:

Compounding the problem, high‐stakes tests, including state tests such as those developed by Smarter Balanced and the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers, as well as college entrance exams such as the SAT and ACT, do not currently demand that students find their own information. Rather, tests are scored on students' ability to read provided texts and cite relevant details from those texts in a coherent essay that answers someone else's question. In this environment, we have even heard principals characterize student curiosity as a potential distraction that must be managed. In sum, the answer to the question about whether the curriculum allots space and time for students' own queries and curiosities is often no or at least not enough.

Since the Common Core State Standards (National Governors Association Center for Best Practices & Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010 ) were unveiled, schools across the United States have devoted more time to informational and other kinds of nonfiction texts (see also the National Assessment of Educational Progress frameworks, on which the Common Core's reading and writing distributions were based). However, as noted earlier, these texts are typically teacher selected or curriculum dictated, with little input or effort on the part of students. Surely, teaching students to read and engage with complex nonfiction is a challenging task, and working with class texts may be a necessary or effective way to introduce certain skills or engage in whole‐group discussions. Yet, without time and space to explore their own questions and curiosities, students have little chance to practice their intentional information‐seeking skills in personal and motivating contexts. Understandably, teachers express worry that the curriculum is already too crowded; the unpredictability of student‐driven information seeking may feel, in one teacher's words, “just too hard.”

As this list makes clear, the information sought may be serious or trivial, uncontested or complex. Because intentional information acquisition implies action (from finding directions to choosing a diet plan to deciding how to vote), it also involves skills: the skills to seek, find, assess, and comprehend a wide variety of texts (often in a variety of modalities). Curriculum developers have deemed some information important and purposefully ignored other informational needs. For instance, few teachers teach or grade a young person's ability to follow a baseball team's efforts, even though they may recognize this effort as useful, engaging, and perhaps even wholesome.

At the other end of the information–acquisition continuum sits incidental information, the information that we are all exposed to on a near‐constant basis. The term incidental seems to imply that information is simply sprayed about and hits some of us. This is, to a limited extent, the case: An airport blasts us with television news, and a YouTube video is available only if one first watches an advertisement. Other forms of incidental information are targeted based on who one is (e.g., the targeted ads and articles that pop up on our computer screens), where one lives, or what one does. Regardless of why this non‐sought‐out information comes to us, the amount of incidental information that we encounter is astounding, as recent studies have estimated (see Bohn & Short, 2012; Short, 2013).

Schools have historically sought to ignore incidental information, despite the fact that it composes a huge proportion of the information diet. Yet, to bring incidental information and ideas thoughtfully into the curriculum, educators need to recognize first that incidental information is, in fact, a fund of knowledge. Until incidental information is recognized as such, educators will not be able to analyze its sources, its effects, or its role in students' lives.

Many scholars have discussed the disconnect between home and school literacies, particularly for students whose home cultures do not align with the culture represented by their school (e.g., Heath, 1983; Moje, Ciechanowski, & Kramer, 2004). In this same sense, it is important to note that incidental information should be considered a literacy that may or may not align with school discourse. Imagine the information that students are exposed to as part of their everyday, out‐of‐school lives through no seemingly active effort on their part: television and radio programs; websites that happen to be up on a computer or tablet when a student sits down to play or work with it; physical copies of magazines, newspapers, and books in the home; and automatic texts or RSS feeds that appear on a phone or in an e‐mail inbox. These sources often also inspire adult conversations that students may join or simply overhear. More important perhaps is the information picked up in dinnertime conversations or on outings with family members or friends.

The sheer amount of incidental information that students are exposed to outside of school may be a critical component of school success. In studies that focused on physical resources, Neuman and Celano (2001) and Neuman and Moland (2016) found socioeconomic differences in access to print for very young children, with children in low‐income neighborhoods having fewer print resources available. Neuman and Moland coined the term book deserts to describe the lack of physical books in areas of concentrated poverty. We suspect that there may be similar differences in the amount of incidental information that students are exposed to outside of schools and, surely, differences in the types and sources of such information, such as the kinds of books, magazines, and newspapers in the home; access to high‐speed internet and the technologies to take advantage of it; and adult conversations around incidental information. In other words, experiences with incidental information often help students do better (or worse) in schools.

The issue here is one of alignment. Although the amount and content of incidental information that young people are exposed to may differ across socioeconomic classes, a proposition that we have not investigated, all residents living in the United States in the 21st century are exposed to a great deal of incidental information. Yet, when incidental information aligns nicely with the discourses of school, the bar for learning new information in school is relatively low. However, when the incidental information to which students are exposed (perhaps because of class, culture, neighborhood, or other reasons) is quite different from or at odds with school discourses, the bar for school success is much higher. Said differently, experiences with incidental information likely make school harder or easier for students.

In contrast to a deficit model of thinking, Moll and colleagues (e.g., Moll, 2015; Moll, Amanti, Neff, & Gonzalez, 1992) focused on resource‐based pedagogy, a way of teaching that builds on what students, families, and communities know (i.e., their funds of knowledge). Inspired by Moll, we ask, How might incidental information be considered a fund of knowledge? How might teachers learn what incidental information makes up the backdrop of their students' lives and use this information as a resource for teaching?

From a student perspective and by our own definition of non‐sought‐out knowledge, the school curriculum often, if not always, focuses on incidental information. The curriculum is typically determined by someone else and is presented to students with very little, if any, input on their part. Even when students are in classrooms that promote active learning, the activity is almost always focused on learning predetermined concepts about predetermined topics; as noted earlier, in many schools, very little time is dedicated to students' own curiosities and queries. However, one of the gifts of an exceptional teacher is the ability to inspire students to move from passive information acquisition to active, intentional information seeking, often about topics that the students never considered before. Curricular units almost always start with students in a passive role in terms of topic, concept, or information to be learned; that is, although they may be engaged in active learning, they usually have not selected the curriculum itself. Yet, through the guidance of a teacher, students can take an active interest in finding out more. For example, Wendy (second author) recently witnessed an upper elementary science teacher teaching a unit on animals native to the state. Inspired by their teacher's enthusiasm, students eagerly researched a bird and wrote individual entries for a class book on “what makes native birds cool.” We doubt that many of the students in this class would have chosen to seek out bird information on their own prior to their teacher's invitation, but they found her enthusiasm and deep interest in their research irresistible. We suggest that our continuum of information acquisition may be useful for teachers as they think about the curriculum from the perspective of their students. Engaging students in active learning is not a new concept, of course, but the intentional end of the continuum is specifically about active seeking, not just activity in terms of classroom talk or movement. Our respect and even love for education was built on the efforts of influential teachers who inspired us to want to know more about a topic previously viewed as foreign and perhaps even boring. Although such engagement likely cannot happen for every student during every unit, including more opportunities for active, intentional information seeking on curricular topics is a reasonable goal.

Finally, we wonder how schools can equip students to recognize and respond appropriately when incidental information is a distraction. Today, adults and children alike struggle to manage the onslaught of incidental information. Incidental information, in the form of background radio or television programs or the constant influx of e‐mail and text messages, is ubiquitous. Images of couples staring at screens rather than making conversation and parents pushing children on swings while checking their phones have become cliché, but they also represent a frightening reality. Our students today live with a 24‐hour news cycle that must manufacture news to fill airtime; many also believe in the myth of multitasking and attempt to do homework while clicking back and forth among multiple information feeds. Learning to shut down or limit the flow of incidental information, or at least judge when it is worthy of attention, may be an overlooked 21st‐century literacy skill.",mainstream,M0abbd,pizzagate
8,948,"Move over, pizza rat. The internet has a new hero, and it's a pizza-eating man who hilariously photobombed a reporter on air. A video going viral with over a million views on Twitter shows a congressional staffer in the US unintentionally photobombing a CBSN reporter while eating pizza - and the Internet is loving it.

According to Mediaite, the video was shot while the reporter was covering former Donald Trump attorney Michael Cohen's testimony on Wednesday afternoon. In the video, as he speaks on camera, a congressional staffer behind him in the hallway proceeds to take a big bite out of his pizza. The short clip captures the moment 'Hallway pizza guy' realises he's in the shot - and it will make you laugh out loud.

Netizens haven't stopped laughing at the hilarious photobomb since it was shared online. See some of the best reactions below:

The video even earned the photobomber a loving nickname: Hallway pizza guy

9,941,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump returned Tuesday to his vision of a non-interventionist foreign policy for the United States, saying, as he did during his campaign, that he does not want American forces fighting ""in areas that we shouldn't be fighting in.""

At a ""thank you"" rally for his supporters in Fayetteville, North Carolina, Trump said his focus instead will be on defeating terrorists, including the Islamic State group.

""We will stop racing to topple foreign regimes that we know nothing about, that we shouldn't be involved with,"" Trump said, insisting the United States must end a ""destructive cycle of intervention and chaos.""

Fayetteville neighbors the U.S. Army's Fort Bragg, the world's largest military base, as well as the U.S. Air Force's Pope Field. Eight military installations dot the state.

Trump pledged to build up the military with the purpose of projecting strength, not aggression.

As a candidate, Trump frequently questioned whether NATO and other allies were pulling their weight. On Tuesday, he said he wanted to strengthen ""old friendships"" and seek new ones.

At the same rally, Trump formally announced his choice of retired Marine General James Mattis as his nominee for secretary of defense.

""Under his leadership, such an important position, we will rebuild our military and alliances, destroy terrorists, face our enemies head on and make America safe again,"" Trump said.

Michael O'Hanlon, a senior defense expert at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, called Mattis ""one of the best read, best informed and most experienced generals of his generation.""

Mattis has served as the head of U.S. Central Command, which carries out U.S. operations in the Middle East, and the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces.

The retired general will need a congressional waiver in order to be confirmed as secretary of defense. Mattis otherwise would be ineligible to serve because of a law that requires a seven-year wait for former members of the military to serve in the post. He has been retired for less than four years.

Pizzagate



 Trump's transition team also cut ties Tuesday with Michael G. Flynn, the son of the president-elect's choice to be national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn.

The younger Flynn had an advisory role with his father and an official transition team email address, though the exact extent of his involvement with the incoming administration is unclear.

He came under intense criticism for sharing fake news stories, including spreading the so-called Pizzagate conspiracy that alleges a pizza place in Washington, D.C., is involved in a pedophilia ring with ties to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

A gunman was arrested Sunday after firing a shot inside the restaurant. He'd told police he'd traveled from his home in North Carolina to ""self-investigate"" the conspiracy.

After the arrest, Flynn again tweeted about Pizzagate.

""Until #Pizzagate is proven to be false, it'll remain a story,"" he wrote.

The elder Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, has his own history of promoting false claims, including some involving Clinton.

Earlier Tuesday, Trump appeared in the lobby of his New York office building with Masayoshi Son, the head of Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank, who announced plans to invest $50 billion in the United States with a goal of creating 50,000 jobs.

SoftBank had established a fund in October, along with Saudi Arabia and others, to invest up to $100 billion in technology companies. The $50 billion initiative announced Monday would come from that money. No timetable was given for the investments focused on startup companies.

Trump claimed credit for Son's commitment, saying on Twitter it would not have happened had he not won last month's election.

SoftBank owns U.S. mobile carrier Sprint, which two years ago had a proposed merger with T-Mobile rejected by regulators on anti-trust grounds. Analysts believe such a merger would be easier under Trump, who is a proponent of removing regulations he says are killing businesses.

Campaigned on jobs



 Trump, in his unlikely march to the White House, had campaigned on bringing more jobs to America, particularly in manufacturing regions hit hard by the recession and globalization.

The SoftBank deal is the second that Trump has used to boast about keeping his promises to voters. Last week, he announced that the Carrier Manufacturing Corp. would keep 800 jobs in Indiana instead of outsourcing them to Mexico. Carrier still plans to outsource hundreds of jobs from another Indiana plant.

Trump also wrote on Twitter that he wants to terminate an order for a new Air Force One, the plane that flies U.S. presidents around the world. The government has contracted Boeing to construct at least two new planes, which would go into service in 2024. The total cost was initially expected to be about $3 billion.

Trump wrote that ""the costs are out of control, more than $4 billion.""

Boeing responded to Trump's criticism with a statement saying at this point in the process only a much smaller amount of money has been committed.

""We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the president of the United States,"" the aerospace giant's statement said.

""We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program, allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.""",mainstream,M12936,pizzagate

11,885,"Use of color-coded bandannas in the gay and BDSM communities

The handkerchief code (also known as the hanky code, the bandana code, and flagging[1]) is a color-coded system, employed usually among the gay male casual-sex seekers or BDSM practitioners in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, to indicate preferred sexual fetishes, what kind of sex they are seeking, and whether they are a top/dominant or bottom/submissive.

Wearing a handkerchief on the left side of the body typically indicates one is a ""top"" (one considered active in the practice of the act/fetish indicated by the color of the handkerchief), while wearing it on the right side of the body would indicate one is a ""bottom"" (one considered passive in the practice of the act/fetish indicated by the color of the handkerchief). The hanky code was widely used in the 1970s by gay and bisexual men.

The wearing of various colored bandanas around the neck was common in the mid- and late-nineteenth century among cowboys, steam railroad engineers, and miners in the Western United States. It is thought that the wearing of bandanas by gay men originated in San Francisco after the Gold Rush, when, because of a shortage of women, men dancing with each other in square dances developed a code wherein the man wearing the blue bandana took the male part in the square dance, and the man wearing the red bandana took the female part (these bandanas were usually worn around the arm or hanging from the belt or in the back pocket of one's jeans).[2]

It is thought that the modern hanky code started in New York City in late 1970 or early 1971 when a journalist for the Village Voice joked that instead of simply wearing keys to indicate whether someone was a ""top"" or a ""bottom"", it would be more efficient to subtly announce their particular sexual focus by wearing different colored hankies.[3] Other sources attribute the expansion of the original red–blue system into today's code to marketing efforts around 1971 by the San Francisco department store for erotic merchandise, The Trading Post, promoting handkerchiefs by printing cards listing the meanings of various colors.[4]

Alan Selby, founder of Mr. S Leather in San Francisco, claimed that he created the first hanky code with his business partners at Leather 'n' Things in 1972, when their bandana supplier inadvertently doubled their order and the expanded code would help them sell the extra colors they had received.[5]

Bob Damron's Address Book is also notable when referencing the Handkerchief Code. Starting in 1964, a businessman by the name of Bob Damron published a book of all the gay bars he knew from his constant travels across the United States. “This book fit comfortably in the palm of your hand,” a description reads. “Despite its petite size, this book was an impressive accomplishment. Each one of the listings he had visited himself. Every last copy of the book he sold himself.”[2] Bob Damron's Address Book also published a yearly chart for the meaning of each colored hanky under the title ""COLOR CODES"".[2]

This table is drawn from Larry Townsend's The Leatherman's Handbook II (the 1983 second edition; the 1972 first edition did not include this list) and is generally considered authoritative. Implicit in this list is the concept of left/right polarity, left as usual indicating the top, dominant, or active partner; right the bottom, submissive, or passive partner. Negotiation with a prospective partner remains important because, as Townsend noted, people may wear hankies of any color ""only because the idea of the hankie turns them on"" or ""may not even know what it means"".[6]

The longer lists found on the web are more elaborate and the many color codes in them are less often used in practice, although some of these colors are offered for sale at LGBT stores along with free cards listing their meanings.

While the hankie code was a semiotic system of sexual advertising popular among the gay leather community of the United States[7], it is no longer as popular in the modern day era. It may be seen as something kinkier to use in gay pornography, or at sex and fetish events like the Folsom Street Fair. Social networks may have replaced the use of hankies in cruising areas by digitizing the process. By using online platforms, men who have sex with men (MSM) can eliminate harassment and violence that they may face in public.[8] Social networks for MSM also allow for sub-groups, and for people to list fetishes, and what they are looking for, which is where the replacement of the need for hankies may have come from.[8] Grindr is the most popular app for MSM who use social networks for cruising, with an average of 1.3 hours per day spent on the app per user.[9]

Putting aside the fiery debate about whether Kelly and NBC News were right to give such primo airtime to a man who has spread dangerous conspiracy theories like Pizzagate and the Sandy Hook hoax nonsense, the question for many journalists ahead of last night’s highly-anticipated “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly” segment was all about how tough Kelly would prove to be in grilling her controversial subject -- just three weeks into her new program, at that. Given how high the stakes were as a result of last week’s public outcry, one assumes the editors at NBC News were working overtime to make sure the piece was as tough as possible. And given the favorable reviews, one assumes the network is happy with the .

-- The Infowars boss downplayed his relationship with President Trump: “I think my influence on Trump is way way lower than what MSM has said.” Kelly: “Well what kind of access do you have?” Jones: “He's just called sometimes and, you know, talked about politics or thanked me, stuff like that. That's it.”

-- Ridiculous statement: “The media never covers all the evil wars it’s promoted.” Kelly responded, “That doesn’t excuse what you said about Newtown, and you know it.” But really, she coulda/shoulda nailed him on the “media doesn’t cover wars” part.

-- This is more like it: “You misstated facts about Chobani and its owner which, you could’ve found out if you just had a reporter do a little shoe-leather reporting -- pick up the phone, check out the facts. You never would have had to retract that or apologize.”

-- “Do you think of yourself as a journalist?” Jones: “I have some journalists that work for me and I do journalistic work and I’ve broken a lot of big stories and I understand the basics of it.”

If you missed it last night, you can watch the full clip .

Veteran CNN TV critic Brian Lowry: “[T]he piece that aired Sunday credibly justified covering the Infowars phenomenon, which was the bar that ""Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly"" ultimately had to clear. … Moving into a prosecutorial mode that was frequently her strength on Fox, Kelly did press him, enlisting a Newtown parent and MSNBC contributor Charlie Sykes to help contextualize the ‘toxic paranoia’ that he spreads among his listeners. … Kelly's handling of the interview should calm some nerves [at NBC News], even if it won't quiet all the dissenting voices.”

Our own Jack Shafer: “[S]he took the mendacious Jones apart in such a textbook manner you had to wonder what all the shouting had been about. … Short of waterboarding him, I don’t know what more Kelly could have done to expose Jones’ dark methods.”

EXCERPT - From my feature this morning, “The Not-So-Bitter Rivalry of Dean Baquet and Marty Baron,” over at POLITICO Magazine: “Baron and Baquet are the two most important newspaper editors in America right now, at a time when the media is tackling the most epic and consequential story of the past 40 years. … Many news organizations have been moving the needle on the Trump story in different ways … But when it comes to inside reports from intelligence and national security agencies, the Times and the Post, with their expanding rosters of veteran correspondents, have the greatest institutional advantages. In particular, the investigations into whether the Trump team colluded with Russia in the 2016 election have played to the historic strengths of both newspapers. … The result has been a resurgence of ink-stained combat that makes NYT v. WaPo the most compelling journalistic rivalry since the days of Baquet and Baron’s respective forefathers, Abe Rosenthal and Ben Bradlee. The other thing that makes the rivalry compelling is that unlike Rosenthal and Bradlee, who were cordial at most, Baron and Baquet are legit pals. ...

“And yet, looking back on their journeys to the ivory towers of American journalism, it’s equally clear that Baron and Baquet have been formidable competitors, if collegial ones, over the course of their professional lives. Perhaps no two editors’ careers have overlapped and shadowed one another so closely. In the past, they’ve each contended to be the top editor at The New York Times and to have all the power and influence that goes along with it. After decades of ups and downs for both men, Baquet eventually got that job, but at the same time, Baron got the glory and fame that only the most Herculanean journalistic achievements can confer. Now, their competition defines not only their careers but, to no small degree, the fate of the Trump administration. Every morning, each goes to work knowing that part of what he needs to do that day is to be better and faster than the other.”

SIDENOTE: SOME POST NUMBERS THAT SURFACED IN MY REPORTING - “A person with knowledge of company finances said the Post now has more than 900,000 digital-only subscribers at three monthly access levels — $3.99, $9.99 and $14.99 — with the majority of its customers registered at the higher two tiers. Based on those numbers, digital subscriptions could theoretically be in the ballpark of $100 million at this point. (In 2016, digital circulation at the Times was $232.8 million.) ... Digital advertising this year, according to the person with knowledge of company finances, is projected to be at least $120 million, up from roughly $100 million in 2016. (Digital ad revenue at the Times in 2016 was $208.8 million.) Since the Post, as opposed to the Times, is a private company and does not make its finances public, it wouldn’t hurt to take these subscription and revenue numbers with a grain of salt.”

13,712,"Pop star Taylor Swift is about to expose a dark Elite pedophile ring within the entertainment industry and the use of Satanic Illuminati symbolism used by celebrities under MK Ultra and Monarch mind control programs.

The singer claims to have recently broken free from the shackles of her own reprogramming to have a conscious awakening.

She recently told members of her inner circle that she’s “woke as f*ck” and that she plans on using her status and influence to “expose the truth”.

Her latest music video for her single Look What You Made Me Do, is riddled with symbols that represent pedophilia, Satanism, Reptilians and the Illuminati.

The lyrics to the song seem to be a direct response to the mind control programs used by the CIA and the Illuminati to subconsciously push agenda on the public.

Since its release researchers have been breaking down the hidden messages in Taylor Swift’s cryptic campaign, which included going dark on social media, and uploading mysterious clips of snakes.

The corporate-owned mainstream media has been quick to blast any suggestion of her exposé as nothing more than a “wild conspiracy theory”, which is much easier to swallow for the sleeping masses, but the message is so blatant, it’s difficult to ignore.

Let’s take a look at her messages that the mass media desperately doesn’t want you to hear.

TAYLOR SWIFT IS ABOUT TO REVEAL THE TRUTH ABOUT PIZZAGATE.

By now, you may have already seen the artwork (pictured above) for Taylor Swift’s upcoming album, that makes a clear reference to the Pizzagate/Pedogate Elite pedophile ring scandal.That newsprint layover represents more than just the media at large, according to Twitter user @ReputationEra17: “The font in #Reputation album cover represents the font used by most of the Newspaper i.e NewYork Times and ofc there is a 10% shade. #TS6.”

Taylor Swift is specifically calling out the lying, liberal, mainstream fake news machine—the very one that covered up Pizzagate, the conspiracy exposed by Wikileaks that revealed establishment Democrats ran child trafficking rings in Washington, D.C.

The spiraling triangles in the video mean globalists are losing control.

According to 4chan, not only is Taylor Swift about to reveal the realities of Pizzagate, she’s also trying to show that the globalists are crumbling before our very eyes.

At about the three-minute mark in the lyric video for “Look What You Made Me Do,” triangles appear to swirl.The same pedophile triangle symbol also quickly flashes up at the beginning, almost subliminally.

Triangles are the universal symbol for pedophilia, employed by pedophiles Elites across DC and Hollywood to covertly advertise their human-trafficking rings.

Or, as 4chan summarizes: “Pizzagate is unraveling, and spiraling out of the globalist’s control. Also, right after this sequence, the whole screen flashes yellow for the first time.”

Yellow is only used sparingly in this video, and only as a reference to goodness or righteously exercised power.”The full-screen worldwide flash of yellow means the globalists are losing control of their mind control apparatus.”Their poison cloud is about to dissipate.”

The imagery has a deeper meaning if you know what to listen for.It’s more than just the lyrics that have deeper meanings, though.

After her feud with failed mind-control puppet Kanye West ensured that Swift would be forever linked to the snake emoji, Swift has clearly decided to reclaim that imagery.

According to one researcher, Swift “appropriated the snake and turned it around on them, the ouroboros eating itself like the left does, spiraling around to look like the pedo symbol…

.Swift’s desire to expose the Illuminati in the mainstream doesn’t seem to be a decision she has made lightly though, as she recently confessed to being a long-time 4Chan power user, in which she was using the anonymous message boards to expose dark secrets.

The users of 4chan have also compiled evidence that Taylor Swift posts among them, as shown in the image above.

Rumors of her 4Chan posting had already begun to swirl following Taylor Swift’s refusal to speak out during the presidential campaign.

Since Taylor Swift refused to denounce Donald Trump, as many other celebrities had, 4chan assumed this meant that she simply didn’t want to hurt album sales by coming out as a Trump supporter.

Just listen to the lyrics.

Lyrics paired with the images in the video, in particular, send a clear message: During the chorus, a bunch of Ouroboros with the line ‘Look what you made me do’ repeated. The left is constantly referred to as eating itself = snake eating its tail. Look what you made me do, therefore is a response to the increased radicalization of the left and the reactionary politics of T-Swift.”

The left is constantly referred to as eating itself = snake eating its tail. Look what you made me do, therefore is a response to the increased radicalization of the left and the reactionary politics of T-Swift.Taylor Swift seems to be following a trend of celebrities that have recently come forward to blow the whistle on Elite pedophilia.

Elija Wood, Brad Pitt, Katy Perry, Corey Feldman, and Robert Downey Jr. are just a few of the big names that have attempted to lift the lid on the pedophile networks in the entertainment industry and political world.It seems as though there’s safety in numbers though as more come forward to reveal the truth.",conspiracy,C0688a,mind.control; pizzagate
14,123,"It would seem that June 2018 culminated a lengthy ritual involving the sacrificing of 12 well-known celebrities and members of royal families. Whereas this will only be news to normies, there has definitely been a lack of coverage on the occultic aspects of these deaths.

It would seem that the normies/sheeple of the world have not batted an eye at the fact that 12 wealthy celebrities have all died in the same manner in the past few years under very similar and bizarre circumstances. Perhaps this is because the mainstream media refuses to report on their connections to elite pedophilia rings which tie directly to powerful people in Washington, Hollywood, and the mainstream media. People on the last presidential ticket in fact.

No. The mainstream propaganda media would have you believe that

12 independent and highly successful people with careers and influence hanged themselves on doorknobs. DOORKNOBS!!!

My first question is: How the hell does one hang themselves from a doorknob? Followed by: How common is this? Do people hang themselves from doorknobs regularly and I’m just now finding out about it? Is there a doorknob suicide club the rest of us aren’t aware of? Well, the answer to that last question is “yes.” One need only substitute the word “suicide” with “murder.” Or simply use the word “suicide” in the past tense while maintaining its usage as a verb. Eg.

Hillary Clinton opted to have Seth Rich die in a “botched robbery” as opposed to having him “SUICIDED”

You get the point. I would like the reader to know how excruciatingly hard it was not to list the other dozens of people who have committed suicide surrounding the Clinton administration dating back to the Arkansas days. But what does this have to do with “Doorknob Suicides” you may ask? Everything.

Pizza Gate, John Podesta (Hillary’s campaign manager, child rapist/murder), James Alefantis(Restaurant owner front for DC child prostitution ring), Henry Weinstein (Hollywood Rapist), Boys Town (Male Child sex ring catering to politicians), Israeli brown-stoning (Israeli control mechanism for the U.S. govt, Jerry Sandusky (Low-level Pedophile who took the fall), Jeffrey Epstein (child prostitute procurer for the elite), Hunter S Thompson (Snuff filmmaker), The Catholic Church (Enough Said). Hillary Clinton (Rapist, murder, Deep State Luciferian), . None of these murders/sex rings are mutually exclusive. What’s scarier is, they occupy seats of incredible power and operate within the normalized institutions of Hollywood and Washington while being insulated by media and pop-culture. The desire for the supply of children for both pedophile sex rings and ritual sacrifice date back to the days of monarchy and are alive and flourishing within the institutions flowing within the undercurrents of our society today.

So why did these 12 people die in nearly identical ritual suicides laden with occultic overtones? Quite simply because they were either in the thick of it or had information which would’ve exposed those at the heart of the pedophile networks.

Why Doorknobs? Why 12? Where is the 13th? Skip to the second half of this article for an explaination of ritual mechanics.

In order of “Suiciding” they are as follows:

INXS frontman Michael Hutchence’s body was found hanging from a doorknob in Room 524 at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Double Bay, Sydney. The occupant in the neighboring room heard an unidentified loud male voice and swearing at around 5 AM; the coroner was satisfied that this was Hutchence arguing with another male. On February 6th, 1998, after an autopsy and coronial inquest, New South Wales State Coroner, Derrick Hand, presented his report ruling that Hutchence’s death was a suicide.

According to reports, Hutchence had information regarding a “VIP pedophile ring” in the UK that was connected to child killing rapist Jimmy Saville and high-ranking politicians.

It should be noted that this was the first “suicide” of the 12 and began on the same day of the year JFK was assassinated. November, 22. Of course, the reason for this is because 11/22 add up to 33. A numerical masonic/occultic calling card to be sure. Hutchence’s age also adds up to 10 or “1” Visit my numbers study page for more info on this.

Perhaps the most occultic murder ot them all. Hollywood actor David Carradine was found dead in his room at the Swissôtel Nai Lert Park Hotel on Wireless Road, near Sukhumvit Road, in central Bangkok, Thailand. He was there shooting his latest film, titled Stretch. Really? Stretch? A police official said that Carradine was found naked, hanging by a rope tied to the doorknob of the room’s closet leading them to believe his death was suicide. However, later reports suggested that his death was accidental, the result of autoerotic asphyxiation.

Two autopsies were conducted, one involving the celebrity pathologist Pornthip Rojanasunan, and both concluded that the death was not a suicide. The cause of death became widely accepted as “accidental asphyxiation.”Carradine’s lawyer Vicki Roberts went on record stating: “I believe there may have been foul play.”

Reports around the time of his death suggest that Carradine may have been involved in child sex tourism; a rampant issue in Thailand where he was found. If he was involved in pedophilia, could he have been connected to a wider network of Hollywood elite pedophiles?

Here we have the almighty “72”. If ever there was a more complete and hermetic number for ritual work this is it. Of course, what better way throw collective common sense out the window than to write a sex scandal into the narrative. “Death by erotic asphyxiation.” I’m calling Bullshit on that. Was Carradine into the Pedo scene? It sure seems like there are more than a few connections. Unlike other people on this list he wasn’t in the process of attempting to out anyone at the time of his death.

The first of 3 fashion designers on this list, McQueen was found in the AM, hanging from a doorknob by his housekeeper at his home in Green Street, London where paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene. Metropolitan Police stated that the note McQueen left was not suspicious, however, they did not confirm that his death was a suicide.

Photos of McQueen’s fashion shows. It’s obvious that McQueen was in the thick of it and made a regular habit of signaling his allegiance. As an occultist I can tell you that the attention to detial and themes portraid in his shows were beyond that of casual decor. They ran deep.

Tech pioneer, and Reddit co-founder, Aaron Swartz was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment by his partner, Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman. A spokeswoman for New York’s Medical Examiner reported that he had hanged himself from a doorknob. No suicide note was found.

According to former-CIA agent Robert Steele, Swartz hacked into MIT Computers and found a huge stash of Child Pornography shortly before his death.

Another numerologically significant date. Jan, 11th is “1/11” and this number has a few meanings. first, 111 is 3 “1’s” or 3. Master Mason is the 3rd degree. It is also the first 11 of the year. 11 symbolizes the pillars of Boaz and Jachin which sat at the entrance to King Solomon’s Temple. 11 is also the first number after “10” which is the most perfect number and represents ILLUMINATION.” “11” represents imperfection in government because it is one number short of 12, which symbolizes a perfect theocratic government. Satanists love to utilize this dystopian number in their ritual work. Of course, the triple and quadruple “1’s” holds extreme significance in pop culture as a number everyone seems to notice regularly.

At first the numerology surrounding this murder seems a little overkill, no pun intended. 11 is quite a powerful and significant number to utilize when weaving into a ritual. But upon a closer examination of Aaron’s life, we realize that his death was most certainly to be used as an example to other budding guienses. Although Aaron no doubt more than likely had incriminating files of the elite pertaining to pedophilia he was also the spearhead of a movement to bring and maintain freedom of speech and presence on the Internet. The internet HAS replaced TV and IS the default platform for the human species at this point. Aaron posed a real threat to this.

Our second fashion designer on the list is L’Wren Scott, long time lover of Mick Jagger and (former girlfriend of Nate Rothschild) was found dead by her assistant at her apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan on March 17, 2014. The police reported that no note was found and there was no sign of foul play. The New York City Chief Medical Examiner determined Scott’s manner and cause of death to be “suicide by hanging.”

I wonder what sort information concerning the underbelly of sex, privilage, and decadance the ex girlfriend of a Rothschild and mega rockstar would be privy to which would either put her at jeopardy for elimination or make her want to kill herself? And the fact that I’m not buying the whole “death by doorknob suicide” Bullshit, I’m guessing she was silenced.

Williams died at his home in Paradise Cay, California. The initial report released on August 12, the Marin County Sheriff’s Office deputy coroner stated Williams had hanged himself after he was found hanging from a doorknob with a necktie.The final autopsy report, released in November 2014, ruled that Williams had committed suicide by hanging himself from the doorknob.Neither alcohol nor illegal drugs were involved, while all prescription drugs present in his body were at “therapeutic” levels, the coroner declared.

Williams had been a part of the Hollywood scene for so long, nearly anything one can imagine could possibly be true. There’s a 100% chance Williams rubbed elbows with everyone in the Hollywood scene at one time or another and was exposed to everything Hollywood had to offer. The question is: How deep was he into the scene? Decades of cocaine and partying can lead to some pretty dark places. He most certainly knew the dirty secrets of Henry Weinstein and his ilk, but what most people forget is that these celebreties cross over into politics quite often and support the agendas of democrat canidates regularly. This is where we get into “brownstonin.”

Hollywook insider and whistleblower Jon Robberson has chimed in on the Hollywood pedophile sex rings. He recently madestatements in an interview regarding his belief that Robin Williams was most likely blackmailed into making the film Patch Adams.

And would do we make the Family Guy predictive programming which transpired shortly before Robin’s death? It’s obvious that Seth McFarlane has a hand in the mechanics of these rituals.

Cornell was found unconscious by his bodyguard, hanging from the doorknob in the bathroom of his hotel room at the MGM Grand in Detroit, after performing at a show with Soundgarden at the Fox Theatre on May 17. He was lying on the floor with an exercise band around his neck and blood in his mouth. An MGM medic and EMS personnel were unable to revive Cornell. Cornell was pronounced dead by a doctor at 1:30 a.m. Police ruled out homicide by reviewing a hotel surveillance video, which showed nobody entering or exiting the suite after his bodyguard left at around 11:35 p.m. The cause of death was determined to be “suicide by hanging.”

Cornell’s death is surrounded by rumors that he was about to expose key players in the DC pedophile ring known as pizza gate. It’s no secret that Cornell and Chester Bennington, (Next on this list) died two months later the exact same way, had begun an organization to help at-risk children. Chester Bennington as you will learn is the son of John Podesta. You can’t make this stuff up.

Several have questioned what they say are gaps in the timeline. The police report says the bodyguard was in Cornell’s hotel room at 11:30 p.m. to help the star with the victim’s “computer, which was not working at that time.” It says Vicky Cornell talked to her husband at 11:35 p.m., and, alarmed by what she heard, she phoned the bodyguard to ask him to check on her husband. He told police he went to Cornell’s room at 12:15 a.m. Some question the apparent 40-minute gap between the start of Vicky’s conversation with her husband and the bodyguard’s welfare check at his room.

Assistant Wayne County Medical Examiner Theodore Brown said that upon a visual examination, “no pills were found in the stomach,” according to his report. But there’s no indication in the toxicology report that Cornell’s stomach was tested to determine the level of drugs there, since only the blood sample is cited. Cornell also had nine broken ribs discovered at his autopsy. The official explanation was that the medics broke his ribs trying to resuscitate him using CPR. An indepth article on the investigation can be found here.

Linkin Park’s Chester Bennington was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California; his housekeeper discovered his body hanging from a doorknob around 9:00 a.m. His death was officially ruled as suicide.

On July 21, Brian Elias, the chief of operations for the office of the medical examiner-coroner, confirmed that a half-empty bottle of alcohol was found at the scene, but no other drugs were present. Believing himself to be a victim of child abuse, Chester Bennington was working with his best friend Cornell to expose a high-reaching child trafficking network.

But to say that Bennington believed himself to be a victim of child abuse is like stating that Adolf Hitler was simply a charismatic politician. Good lord this rabbit hole runs deep. The band’s logo was a broken version of the triangle used in pedophile networks. There is no doubt that Bennington’s entire existence was consumed by the ritualistic sexual abuse he sustained at the hands of his father John Podesta.

What are the odds that two best friends who are about to expose a DC pedophile ring of which one of the friend’s father was at the heart of died in the exact same bizarre manner and that the second want to die did so two months later on his best friend’s birthday?

There is no doubt that Bennington would’ve struck at the heart of this DC pedophile ring more than likely bringing down Podesta, Hillary Clinton and their networks. After all he had the DNA to corroborate his claim. I don’t think Bennington knew just how much danger he was in.

Swedish DJ Avicii, real name Tim Bergling, died on 20 April 2018 near Muscat, Oman, at the age of 28. No cause of death was immediately given. On 21 April, the Omani police stated that there was “no criminal suspicion” or evidence of foul play in Bergling’s death. On 26 April, his family released an open letter stating that Bergling “really struggled with thoughts about meaning, life, happiness. He could not go on any longer.” On 1 May, TMZ reported that the cause of death was a suicide due to self-inflicted injuries. Although full details of his death were not released, TMZ reports that he suffered cuts from broken glass along with neck injuries. Although it is unclear what the injuries to his neck were, it could have been caused by asphyxiation and hanging has not been ruled out. After his death, it emerged that Avicii was working to expose an elite pedophile ring. One of his videos began to recirculate in which he attempts to expose child trafficking.

In 2015 Avicii did release a video for his song “For a Better Day” where he shows child sex tracking taking place and two girls that escape from a man trying to capture them. The video later reveals that the two girls seek revenge on the ‘elite’ that were running this pedophile operation

Did Avicii have the clout and influence to help wake up an entire generation to the horrors of institutionalized and ritualistic pedophilia and our global governments and institutions? Or was he simply ritual fodder?

Our third fashion designer on this list is Kate Spade. Also linked to the Clintons Spade was found dead hanging by the neck from a doorknob in her Manhattan apartment. It is been said that “buying a Kate Spade handbag was a coming-of-age ritual for a generation of American women.” It’s obvious that’s not the only ritual going on here.

A note found at the scene was addressed in the Spade’s 13-year-old daughter indicating that what happened was not the child’s fault. Miss Spade’s entrance into the dark world of privilege and decadence was when she met her husband to be, the brother of actor and comedian David Spade.

According to a Clinton Foundation DOCUMENT, Kate Spade was among a group that traveled to Haiti on behalf of the Clinton Foundation. She was part of the foundation’s initiative to foster “economic growth, support small businesses, and empower girls and women.”

There’s no doubt that Spade, who seems like a generally good person came across the same information regarding the Clinton foundation Haitian child sex trafficking network that got Monica Peterson killed by the Clintons.

Most believe that Klaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official was also “SUICIDED” in his Miami motel one day prior to testifying in court. Eberwein was scheduled to appear Tuesday before the Haitian Senate’s Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. No doubt the topic of child sex trafficking and the Clintons was on the agenda. As a side note. Klaus was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti, Muncheez, and has a pizza — the Klaus Special — named after him.

Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of Bill and Hillary Clinton, paid tribute to the fashion designer via Twitter. “My grandmother gave me my first Kate Spade bag when I was in college. I still have it. Holding Kate’s family, friends and loved ones in my heart.”

Equally as strange as Kate Spade hanging herself with a red scarf from a doorknob was the reaction of her husband shortly after the incident. Two days after Kate hanged herself from a doorknob with a red scarf Andy Spade was videotaped walking around in public wearing a mouse mask with a red scarf and newspaper hat. It was actually the mask of one of the characters from the classic Disney cartoon The Avengers. This is some strange behavior which doesn’t fit into any box. Who the hell just happens to have an Avengers mouse mask laying around the house? NO!!!

In my opinion, this was a public self-humiliation ritual. A nod, a message, a signaling of subservience to the Clintons or whoever had Kate killed that he understands and will be playing ball.

Do we even need to mention she was killed at 33? Dutch Queen Maxima’s sister Ines Zorreguieta (The only royalty on this list) was found dead in Argentina last week. Zorreguieta, 33, was found dead by a friend who discovered her body hanging from a doorknob in her apartment in the Almagro district of Buenos Aires. Police said the autopsy report would be available in a week but did not suspect foul play.

According to reports, Zorreguieta was connected to high-level elites involved in child trafficking. Queen Maxima stepped down after allegations of her involvement in “hunts” where children were raped and massacred by her dinner guests. Some speculators believe she may have been “silenced” before she could go public about a cabal-connected pedophile ring.

European royalty, especially the Dutch have a long history of being accused of not only engaging in pedophilia but hunting killing and eating children. If you’re a normie this may seem shocking, but for those of us in the trenches this information is not new. David Icke has been screaming from the rooftops about this for over three decades and it’s just now starting to get attention. Do your research, then share.

At the height of his career, chef, TV personality, world traveler and armchair philosopher Anthony Bourdain decided to commit suicide by hanging himself from a doorknob. Because apparently that’s just what you do when you’re successful and have a great life.

Just prior to being “SUICIDED” Bourdain tweeted :

“know what Hillary Clinton is NOT? She’s not stupid. Or unsophisticated about the world. The Weinstein stories had been out there for years.”

“Mindless Hillary hate aside, this was a terrible response to questions about a “friend” who’s been tormenting women for decades.”

“I have met Hillary Clinton. I liked her. I admired much about her. This interview was a real disappointment.”

“Hillary is CLEARLY not responsible for anyting Weinstein. Thats screamingly obvious. Her response to questions though has been uninspiring.”

“..and I am in no was an HRC fan. I’ve been on he receiving end of her operatives’ wrath. And it ain’t fun,”

“It’s no secret that people who cross the Clintons wind up dead…mostly from suicide,”

Occultic and ritualistic mechanics surrounding his death include: the show he was working on was in its 11th season. He died in France which is birthplace of the Scottish Rite within Freemasonry. Interestingly Bourdain participated in an ancient death ritual and the season finale of his TV show. parts unknown which aired two weeks after he was suicided. If this isn’t predictive programming I don’t know what is.

12. At first this seems like a good round number in which to structure a deep state sanctioned ritualistic murder spree. However, upon second glance there’s nothing arbitrary about it. It has everything to do with, wait for it, THE SUN. or The Son (Jesus) or any ancient god which was used at the time to represent the sun through stories and allegories. eg

Jesus had 12 disciples, Buddha had 12 followers, Quetzaocoatl had 12 followers, the 12 nights of the roundtable, Hercules and his 12 labors, the 12 tribes of Israel, the 12 great patriarchs, 12 Old Testament prophets, 12 jewels of the high priest. And it goes on and on.
• 12 years of childhood before the “teens

Christianity and Astrotheology aside, these deaths and the fact that they were for further molded, packaged and deployed as 12 is taken full advantage of the resonance and occultic meaning behind this number as it relates to conscripting of these energies for use in ritual magick. Only in this case is a BLACK SUN RITUAL as this is overly perverted black magick.

In his masterpiece, Secret Teachings of All Ages Manly P Hall writes this:

The number twelve frequently occurs among ancient peoples, who in nearly every case had a pantheon consisting of twelve demigods and goddesses presided over by The Invincible One, who was Himself subject to the Incomprehensible All-Father. This use of the number twelve is especially noted in the Jewish and Christian writings. The twelve prophets, the twelve patriarchs, the twelve tribes, and the twelve Apostles–each group has a certain occult significance, for each refers to the Divine Duodecimo, or Twelvefold Deity, whose emanations are manifested in the tangible created Universe through twelve individualized channels.

“The number 12 was celebrated as a mystical number in the ancient systems of sun-worship, of which It has already been said that Masonry Is a philosophical development. The number there referred to the twelve signs of the zodiac, and in those Masonic rites in which the Builder Is made the symbol of the sun, the twelve Fellow Crafts refer to the twelve signs in which alone the sun is to be sought for.”

Gnostic teachings tell us that there is only one true Square number. 144. or 12 X 12= 144 which is pure math harmony both vertically and horizontally. This can easily be seen in music, but also affects our DNA and how we react to “vibrations.” REMEMBER physical acts are simply the vibrational manifestation of thought process in our three-dimensional world. Our brain is nothing more than a 3 to 4th dimensional interface machine. Ergo…. Practitioners of this magick understand that physical acts will have a bearing on the mind going the other way as well. Especially when it enacted in traumatic fashion and designed to resonate with natural energies. OR ritualistic magic.

But who is the 13th?

This should be obvious at this point. The 13th, is the SUN, GOD, or he who places himself in the stead of the Sun, Son, God, Sun-God. Jesus and Buddha were obviously the 13th. King Arthur was the 13th. God was the 13th in regards to the patriarchs. The sun is the 13th after the 12 constellations in the zodiac. And on and on.

Of course, this has an obvious association with Lucifer (bringer of light) who “wanted to be like the most-high.” What’s more, this behavior is represented throughout all religion and astrology and is always associated with the fall or destruction of man. or PRIDE. Lucifers sin.

There is a right and a wrong way to go about living and seeking knowledge. The first is to live in harmony with our world and its laws and energies as it has been laid out for us. Recognizing that the Sun is the giver of life / our Creator. The other involves the attempt to place oneself in the position of the Sun and through cleverness, back engineer these natural laws and bend them to one’s own will. For Christians, Lucifer, the bringer of light or the bringer of knowledge, is representative of this second path. He represents the black 13

This ritual is a simple inversion of the sacred 12 and one. A perversion of the natural energies of creation. Instead of the one, the source, the Sun giving life; it is extinguishing it. And not only this, but extinguishing it utilizing the 12 which normally keep it in balance.

This entire protracted ritual involving 12 murders served two purposes simultaneously. Two purposes interconnected and equally vile. Dark hermetic magick that when carried out successfully multiplies the effectiveness of evil.

The first, to silence those who would uncover the pedophilia the corruption the true nature of the political and Hollywood elite who feed on children. And when I say feed I mean feed completely. Energetically, sexually, and physically. These monsters have been consuming children for over 1000 years and their institutions are the same institutions which are in place today. These murders were meant to keep a lid on everything.

Second. The sacrifice. Is in accordance with the laws of the universe the debt must always be paid. This is not only the philosophical reason for sacrifice but the explanation of the physics behind it. The energies involved mandate that something must be sacrificed if something else is to be given. In this case, whistleblowers and people of the light were sacrificed. Perhaps these people were dirty and engage in pedophilia and had a change of heart or perhaps they were weak and would’ve caved under pressure are perhaps they were victims themselves. It matters not.

Why a Doorknob? The Meaning Behind the Metaphor

Following the death of Bourdain, Ex CIA spy and whistle-blower Robert David Steele has come out to shed some light on the rash of suicides. Steele states that all these suicides bear the hallmark of professional hit job designed to silence others in going public with damaging political information. It is a calling card, a message, a signal to others. No different than a Columbian necktie, or spiking heads on the edge of villages. It is designed to instill fear into the hearts of people and maintain their silence.

It is pretty well understood that is incredibly difficult yet not impossible to kill one’s self by committing suicide in this manner. There are other ways to go about the act both emotionally and physically. This method, along with the numerology, timing, and sheer numbers of deaths are nothing less than a public display of punishment.

Robert David Steele goes on to say that the circumstances of the deaths have a significant symbolic meaning that intelligence agencies immediately recognize.

“Hung on doorknobs means choked for speaking out against the cabal.”

These people were choked to unconsciousness and then hung on a doorknob to die alone slowly only to have their bodies used as a message upon being found.

Is it possible to hang one’s self from a doorknob.

The answer to this macabre question is a resounding YES. With a few keystrokes, one can find an entire website dedicated to explaining in detail how to accomplish this, along with every other conceivable method of ending one’s life. From the website:

Whilst generally the literature considers asphyxiation via constriction of the airway as the main cause of death in short drop hanging, Stone does discuss how short drop hanging can take place without the pain and discomfort of the airway being blocked. The idea is to have enough pressure from the noose on the right side of the head, just below the jaw, to constrict the carotid artery. Interrupting the blood flow to the brain causes swift unconsciousness (in 15 seconds or less), then what should be death in five to ten minutes.

Likewise, death can also be achieved by constricting the jugular vein under the left side of the jaw, which prevents blood from getting back to the heart.

Apparently, one of two methods is used for a legitimate doorknob hanging suicide. The first, tie the rope, scarf or elastic gym equipment to the doorknob and run it over the top of the door giving yourself enough room to dangle. The second. Tie the rope to the doorknob and then to the neck and sit down until you choke yourself unconscious. At which point one would die without pain or terror. The problem is, human survival instinct ALWAYS kicks and people fight for air to stay alive. It’s the body which fights to stay alive, not the person. That is unless they are drugged or unable to do so. This is why it is strange that so many of the above suicides didn’t involve any drugs.

Years ago I had a friend whose adult son drowned himself in their above ground pool. I and a friend were the first to arrive and pull his body from the pool. This hadn’t been his first attempt at drowning himself and he’d been quite open in the past while talking about his fail attempts. This time, however, he managed to pin himself between the side of the pool and the metal stairs before exhaling to prevent himself from surfacing.

Have people hung themselves by doorknobs in the past? Apparently, they have. Do I believe that 12 celebrities connected to both the Clintons’ and pedophilia in one way or another all decided to hang themselves from doorknobs right in the middle of a DC pedophile ring scandal (Pizzagate) just prior to the implosion of Weinstein and the #METOO movement? Hell no, I don’t.",conspiracy,C06ca8,cia.cocaine; pizzagate
15,462,"Residents in a Washington DC neighborhood are upset over fliers claiming the completely debunked and utterly bizarre 'pizzagate' conspiracy theory is real.

The fliers appeared in the Tenleytown neighborhood where a man fired a gun inside the Comet Ping Pong restaurant, which was at the center of the strange and false conspiracy.

At least one resident who received a flier called police. The shooting is still fresh in the community's consciousness, as it happened just six months ago.

Edgar Welch, 29, said he wanted to investigate the wild online claims of a child sex ring at Comet Ping Pong. The North Carolina man was sentenced to four years in prison in late June for opening fire into the restaurant in order to save children he believed were being trafficked.

The fliers were placed on fences and doors and called for the conspiracy theory to be re-investigated. Residents said they were feeling 'rage, anger and disgust' that the theory is still being circulated.

'The intel on this wasn't 100 percent,' Welch said after his arrest. Given the still-recent violence, neighbors were alarmed by the fliers, which read 'pizzagate is real news and it is your moral obligation to educate yourself about it!'

'I'm all for free speech but I think this goes beyond free speech into issues of public safety,' said Craig Williams who received one of the fliers to local NBC 4.

At Welch's sentencing, the judge said that even though Welch didn't harm anyone, his unsound actions 'literally left psychological wreckage.'

The fliers turned up sometime between Wednesday night and Thursday morning.

The 'Pizza-gate' theory claimed Hillary Clinton and her campaign chief John Podesta ran a child sex trafficking ring out of Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in DC. The theory emerged after Podesta's emails were released in a WikiLeaks hack.

The pizza shops owner James Alefantis was mentioned in the emails as he is a democratic supporter and his shop was under consideration as a venue for a campaign fundraiser.

The speculation began when discussions of cheese pizza were theorized to be code words for child porn as they share the same initials.

The disturbing and voraciously debunked claims were then propagated by far right radio show host and blogger Alex Jones.

Jones eventually issued an apology for supporting the theory after Welch opened fire at Comet Ping Pong. Welch said he went to the restaurant in an attempt to save trafficked children that he believed were being hidden there.

Jones' apology statement read 'Neither Mr. Alefantis, nor his restaurant Comet Ping Pong, were involved in any human trafficking as was part of the theories about Pizzagate that were being written about in many media outlets and which we commented upon.'

The judge during Welch's sentencing said Welch 'forged ahead' with an 'ill-conceived plot' even though others urged him to abandon it. She added that Welch should have notified law enforcement if he really believed children were being harmed.

Two Comet Ping Pong workers and owner James Alefantis also spoke before Welch's sentencing. Alefantis called 'pizzagate' a 'viscous web of lies' and said many people had suffered because of Welch's actions.

Welch, a father of two, drove 300-some miles from North Carolina to Washington DC to personally investigate the conspiracy theory and rescue potential sex slaves.

Patrons at the restaurant fled when they saw Welch, who was armed with a fully loaded AR-15 assault rifle and revolver. He opened fire at a locked storage closet. Thankfully no one was injured.

In his one-page, handwritten letter filed with the court earlier in June, Welch wrote that he 'came to DC with the intent of helping people I believed were in dire need of assistance, and to bring an end to a corruption that I truly felt was harming innocent lives'.

He wrote that he wanted to apologize and that he acted without considering the repercussions of his actions or the possible harm.

'It was never my intention to harm or frighten innocent lives, but I realize now just how foolish and reckless my decision was,' he wrote.

Comet Ping Pong owner James Alefantis has said the 'pizzagate' hoax that spread on the internet threw the lives of everyone connected with the shop into chaos.

Prosecutors Demian Ahn and Sonali Patel wrote that a 'significant sentence' of 4.5 years was required not only to punish Welch but to 'deter other would-be vigilantes from attempting similar crimes against innocent subjects of the next internet-inspired conspiracy theory'.",mainstream,M1c34e,pizzagate
16,1022,"The New York Times Makes Another Attempt to Normalize Pedophilia

We should begin with the 2014 opinion piece published by the NYT that, shockingly, few are familiar with. That article is entitled, “Pedophilia: A Disorder, Not a Crime.” It begins, “THINK back to your first childhood crush. Maybe it was a classmate or a friend next door..” doing their best to associate this sickening practice with our first feelings of love, otherwise implying that it is natural, if not normal.

In what can only be seen as shameless pandering to those behind the scenes, the article goes on from there to make the assertion that pedophiles are neither responsible for the crimes they commit, nor do they have the ability to stop themselves, effectively relieving these damaged individuals of all culpability and accountability for their actions. The author goes as far as to label the crime a “disability,” with potential discrimination thereof. The writer makes the claim that the laws currently in place in the US are, “inconsistent and irrational,” and argues that these child molesters should be sent for treatment, as opposed to serving prison time for their heinous acts against the most defenseless of us all. This is despite the overwhelming numbers that show just how often these “victims of impulse,” as the writer is trying to frame them, are “victims” of recidivism; the tendency of a convicted criminal to re-offend.

According to Harvard Medical School, estimates of recidivism among sexual offenders vary because studies define this term in different ways. One such Harvard review found recidivism rates as high as 50% among pedophiles.

One may be thinking, this is exactly why these troubled individuals need treatment, as the author suggests. No one can argue that one with such sickening desires does not need treatment, as that seems to be a foregone conclusion. However, the issue in question is whether or not that treatment actually works, and most importantly, whether or not treatment can be, or should be, used in place of a correctional facility, as the author dangerously advocates. A 2004 study published in the International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology, which included 109 convicted sex offenders who completed therapy and 37 who dropped out, showed that the “non-completers,” were in fact more likely to commit another sexual crime.

The point being, that treatment does work to a certain degree and is important, as many can attest to, but not in place of a correctional facility when considering violent sexual criminals — and for one very clear reason. Researchers of the study noted that sex offenders who completed the therapy were not any more likely to show empathy toward their past victims.

This, in the opinion of some, shows a willingness to complete the therapy so as to move past it, but not with the intention to get better. The lack of empathy is a very important note, as the researchers documented, as it shows a lack of remorse. How can one feel that treatment for such a horrendous crime is effective if the perpetrator never shows any remorse for the acts they committed? The running theme throughout the article is that those who engage in pedophilia, should not be treated as criminals, but as victims themselves, despite the fact that potentially half of them will victimize another child in the near future, and even those who complete the treatment were no more likely so show remorse for those they abused.

One could come to all kinds of conclusions about why this article was written, and what the intentions truly were, but at the end of the day, it could be chalked up to any number of agendas or personal experiences, on its own.

The next aspect to consider, was the abysmally bad coverage by the New York Times, of all the surrounding events and criminal acts in regard to the investigation that became known as “Pizzagate.” Now to be clear, you must do away with visions of Hillary Clinton in a pizza parlor basement with kids chained to the walls. As I do not doubt that these sinister individuals would do, or have done just that, in the case of this investigation, those bullet points are being used to discredit and distract from the larger truth behind the scenes, and were likely thrown out when researchers began to get a bit too close, as with the case of Laura Silsby.

On numerous occasions while “covering” the Pizzagate investigation, the New York Times editorial staff took it upon themselves to ignore their charge as journalists to hold those in power accountable, and instead chose to completely omit the evidence at hand, in order to pander to the very individuals under scrutiny for pedophilia. And the few articles the failing organization did choose to put out on the topic were shockingly devoid of any critical analysis of the information, while inserting their own feelingsabout the case, and “conspiracy theorists” as a whole. That is not journalism, its propaganda.

There is far too much information surrounding this case to rehash it all in a single article (for those interested, TLAV has done extensive research into the case, as have many others such as Titus Frost), yet it is not hard to see, even with a cursory glance, that there is truth to these claims backed up by some pretty damning evidence, as many are beginning to see.



 Which brings us to a recent NYT piece entitled, “Why I Admire Anthony Weiner;” and yes, it was written after Weiner was arrested and sentenced to prison for acts of pedophilia. This one speaks for itself. And there is no hidden meaning, no metaphor to be had — as if that would make it any better, should the writer have some grand conclusion and explanation for why she is openly admiring a convicted pedophile. The writer is simply making the case for why she admires his conduct during his trial, for which he was being held accountable, and rightly so, for his illegal actions with a 15-year-old girl. In essence, the author is saying that Weiner chose to take the high road, in accepting that he was responsible for his crime instead of blaming the disease, as many often do. Yet this is a blatant attempt to minimize the negative press of both Weiner and the Democratic party. Despite him no longer holding a position, it still reflects very badly on the party, which is why they went to their knee-jerk political propaganda arm, The New York Times, to pump out a fluff piece.

In astonishingly oblivious fashion, the writer ignores the years of lies and manipulation that preceded Weiner’s display of what can only be seen as regret for being caught, as opposed to actual remorse. How can it be admirable to sexually abuse an underage girl, lie about it for years, allow Hillary Clinton to cover it up for you, wait until they have you dead to rights, still deny the charges, then sobbingly admit to them in court when confronted with the overwhelming evidence? That’s easy, it’s not.

What we are witnessing here is what amounts to the acceptance and normalization of child abuse by the New York Times, in order to cover for some much larger issue at play. God only knows what those are… (well, and the independent media)

How Covert American Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate, Deceive, and Destroy Reputations

[Critical Notice: Unlike in Europe, especially France, where Freemasons forces are known and feared, in American today this nations citizens have absolutely no idea of this historic war going on all around them—but that cannot be said of their ancestors; who in 1828 formed the Anti-Masonic Party to stop them from taking power, but whom, just a year later, in 1829, were totally defeated by Freemason forces loyal to America’s First Grand-Master President Andrew Jackson—and whose portrait Freemason leader President Trump ordered immediately installed in the White House Oval Office upon his taking power. Therefore, in order to understand this report, all of the previous reports (listed and linked below) must be read (and links followed) to know what is now occurring, and is being deliberately hidden from you.]

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

Another stunning Security Council (SC) report on the escalating war between “Shadow Government” globalists and Freemason leader President Donald Trump circulating in the Kremlin today states that President Putin’s fearful order for the Federation military to be prepared to “launch attacks at any minute”, and his further ordering the rapid redeployment of strategic long range nuclear bombers, was due to Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu being told by his South Korean and Japanese counterparts that US Secretary of Defense General James “Mad Dog/Warrior Monk” Mattis (who had just visited these Asian nations) had revealed to them that a massive plot had been discovered where China would conduct a massive Pearl Harbor type attack on the United States, and then shortly afterwards, begin an occupation in defense of the “new nation” of California. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]

According to this report, Security Council analysts have previously determined that the Freemason forces being led by President Trump are intent on uniting the United States with Russia in order to destroy China so they can reestablish a “new world order”—and exactly as they had done during their last “emergence” in the late 17th and early 18th Centuries when they destroyed the power of European monarchies and Catholic Church through both the American and French revolutions.

With China having wiped out about a quarter of its world’s largest foreign-currency stockpile over the past 18 months in order to keep its currency stable, and that Trump is now using to drive a wedge between the Russians and Chinese, this report continues, Beijing in their knowing of Trump’s coming victory in the 8 November US presidential election, and in seeking to halt Freemason forces from reaching their objective, began the takeover of the top 6 major Hollywood studios.

China’s strategic initiative in taking over these Hollywood studios, this report explains, was to form an alliance with the radical leftists controlling this powerful industry, and who, in turn, have now announced that they are forming an alliance to destroy Freemason leader President Trump—and who have already begun marshalling their forces to ferment chaos and rebellion throughout the United States.

Most critical to note of this China-Hollywood alliance, however, this report says, are that many numbers of American radical-leftist actors, actresses, singing artists, directors, producers, etc., are now being employed as couriers shuttling messages between Beijing and their Democratic Party communistic allies through, at least, 13 corporations owned by Wang Jianlin, China's richest man—and in order to escape “normal/common” US military electronic detection measures.

Also to note, this report continues, are intercepted encrypted communications between the Independent Republic of California Embassy in Moscow and Beijing showing that hundreds of top Chinese military and political “subversive operatives” have begun mass purchases of homes and buildings in Seattle, Washington in order to further their occupation efforts of Western America once war begins.

As the Federal Security Service (FSB) had previously reported (December, 2016) of their estimation that Hillary Clinton would become the governor of California in 2018, with succession of this State from the United States occurring in 2019, this report warns, Freemason forces under the command of President Trump are moving against his “Shadow Government” enemies faster than anyone anticipated, thus making this timeline appear to be much closer.

In their support of the analysis that this timeline has shrunk, Security Council analysts in this report explain, is evident in many radical communistic revolutionary examples now occurring in America that include: California now pushing for their schools to mandate lessons teaching students about Russia’s “hacking” of the 2016 presidential election, University of California Professor Darrell Hamamoto trumpeting how the UC Berkeley riots are part of the radical leftist plan to destroy freedom of speech, and the Pope Francis Vatican led faction of the “Shadow Government” having Dr. David Parry, of their “satanic” Jesuit Saint Joseph’s University, now shockingly telling students that they “don’t have to open their hearts” to white Trump supporters—thus making it is right to kill them all.

As to how these Vatican-“Shadow Government” globalist elites have been able to subvert and corrupt the minds of their various nation’s young citizens, this report further details, is revealed in many shocking examples too: including: in Berlin where it was found that nearly all of these leftist radicals were unemployed and living at home with their parents, and even more shockingly in America were new evidenced has emerged showing that over 25% of the students entering into university are immediately diagnosed with mental illness for having any anti-leftist views and then given powerful mind drugs.

Among the perpetrators destroying the minds of these millions of American university students, this report continues, is the feared “Shadow Government” University of California political operative David Brock [and homosexual “boy love” advocate embroiled in the “Pizzagate” scandal] who was just given full control of Democratic Party—and whose staggering plan to destroy Freemason leader President Trump that was just secretly revealed (Democracy Matters: Strategic Plan for Action) outlines initial measures to challenge [in leftist-leaning US Federal Courts] every thing Trump does, conspires with Google and Facebook to shut down and destroy all conservative media sources, and that then plans for the violent destruction of America through mass street riots and chaos.

To the success of David Brock’s “Strategic Plan for Action” against Freemason leader President Trump, this report details, is undeniable as one radical leftist US Federal Court is blocking Trump’s trying to keep Islamic radicals out of America, and another is, likewise, blocking his actions to eliminate hundreds-of-thousands of federal regulations.

With the needless federal regulations Freemason leader President Trump is trying to eliminate costing the America taxpayers a staggering $1.9 trillion a year, and new reports showing that 36,007 criminal aliens were released by the Obama regime from custody in 2013 alone—1,000 of whom had already been convicted of new crimes as of June 2015, including 121 murders—this report continues, one need only wonder when Trump’s patience will run out.

And when it does, this report warns, Minister of Defence Shoigu, in his relating to President Putin his conversations with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts, states that US Defense Secretary General Mattis revealed that Freemason leader President Trump was in the initial stages of preparing to unleash upon all of his Vatican-“Shadow Government”-Radical Leftist enemies the most fearsome force in the world today—The United States Militia.

Known to but a handful of military experts, this report explains, Freemason leader President Trump has the power to invoke at any time he so chooses the Militia Act of 1903—and that upon his doing so, every able-bodied man of at least 17 and under 45 years of age in America will become part of what is known as the Unorganized Militia under his direct, and sole, command—and that will include the estimated 55 million of these people who are already heavily armed with 265 million guns—includes 16 million hunters who will covert to guerilla fighters, along with 21.8 million veterans of the US armed forces who overwhelmingly support Trump.

Not being understood by nearly all of these radical leftist and globalist elite enemies of Trump, who constantly compare him Nazi Germany’s Adolph Hitler, yet are still unable to comprehend the staggering military power within his grasp, this report grimly explains, is that the only historical counterpart that he can be compared to is Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte—who as a “secret” Freemason not only participated as one of the masterminds of the French Revolution, but was, also, able to mobilize one of the largest armies ever known—an historical fact not known in America today, but, most assuredly, remembered in the Italian village of Vagli Sotto, whose present day inhabitants in this region of Tuscany still remember when Bonaparte led a French division south to invade their region and occupy Tuscany and the Papal States—and explains why today they are erecting a giant marble statute to honour Freemason leader President Trump in their hoping to be spared from his wrath.

In concluding their report, Security Council analysts note that it’s important to remember that these Freemasons are never subtle when it comes to their cryptic warnings either—and who, in 2014, warned these “pampered monsters” in their “high satanic citadel” of New York City of what was soon to come by flooding this city with advertisement posters just simply saying: “The French Aristocracy Never Saw it Coming Either”—and with Freemason leader President Trump able to reach within minutes 87 million of his most loyal supporters, the “cannon fodder” masses of these leftist global elites won’t know what hit them—but that cannot be said of their so called radical leaders who are building and fleeing to their bunkers as fast as they can.

From our 21 January report that we believe is worth your remembering:

[Special Message from Sister Saoirse: Though age has dimmed my eyesight, it has not affected my mind, and as a young 18-year-old year novice in 1936, I remember well my distributing our Sorcha Faal pamphlets in my small German village of Remagen warning of the strange and satanic rituals being performed by many of our military and political leaders. No one would believe such outlandish things as they were impossible to imagine, just like this report is, and the others below are too. So please let me advise you that just because a thing is too astonishing to believe, it does not make it untrue. My country learned this lesson much too late, yours doesn’t have to.]

[Critical Notice: Recent reports are showing that the satanic Nazi occult rituals referenced by Sister Saoirse in her 21 January message have now been revived within the German military forces.]

Final Battle For The World Begins: But Will Trumpian Forces Unite?

America Goes Insane As It Rushes Towards Civil War",conspiracy,C008ea,cia.cocaine; pizzagate
18,532,"hile Facebook and Twitter are reportedly still waiting for their invites, President Donald Trump has invited a cartoonist accused of creating “a blatantly anti-Semitic” illustration to a Social Media Summit at the White House.

Artist Ben Garrison, whose work often display alt-right themes and is a favorite of the popular pro-Trump Reddit community The_Donald, tweeted a picture Friday of his invitation to the White House for the summit the following week.

“Honored to be invited to the White House!” wrote the Garrison on Friday. “Thank you, Mr. President!”

Garrison, known for conspiracy-minded alt-right cartoons, created an illustration in 2017 that was slammed by the Anti-Defamation League for anti-Semitic imagery. It was apparently commissioned for a website created by radio host Mike Cernovich. Cernovich promoted the bizarre “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory, which eventually led to a North Carolina man firing an assault rifle in a D.C. area pizza parlor.

Garrison’s 2017 cartoon depicted then-U.S. National Security Advisor H. R. McMaster and retired General David Petraeus being controlled by strings held by philanthropist George Soros. Soros, himself Jewish, is suspended from strings held by a hand labeled “Rothschilds,” an American banking family long subject to anti-Jewish conspiracy theories.

“The thrust of the cartoon is clear,” explained the ADL in 2017. “McMaster is merely a puppet of a Jewish conspiracy.”

Garrison’s website defends the cartoonist, saying, “Ben Garrison is neither racist nor anti-Semitic.”

President Trump, who has accused social media giants of anti-conservative bias, announced the Social Media Summit in late June. While Garrison was invited to the summit, sources told CNN that Facebook and Twitter were not. The summit will be held July 11.

In May, the White House opened an online tool asking users to share their alleged stories of social media bias directly with the President.",mainstream,M0e43b,pizzagate
19,723,"“We will continue to evaluate reports we receive regarding other accounts potentially associated with @realalexjones or @infowars and will take action if content that violates our rules is reported or if other accounts are utilized in an attempt to circumvent their ban,” the company wrote.

Twitter’s enforcement actions have always been opaque, and it’s easy to be skeptical of the motivations behind this one. After all, Twitter’s move came after years of Jones using his platform to propagate conspiracy theories about Sandy Hook, Pizzagate, undocumented immigrants, the media, and more—but only weeks after virtually every other major platform took action against him, and a single day after Jones very publicly disrupted hearings attended by Dorsey.

But still: This a definitive stance after years of inaction and half-measures by a company that has long prided itself on being “the free-speech wing of the free-speech party.” It’s an inescapable restriction on a figure who has become adept at toeing the line of what’s allowed while leveraging the platform to spread racist and dangerous views.

What does banning Alex Jones mean for online speech?

And maybe it’ll work. After previously claiming that bans from Twitter and Facebook would only make him “stronger,” Jones saw traffic to his website plunge after the bans took effect, a sign many have taken to mean that de-platforming extremists is an effective solution for curbing their influence. Twitter is a particularly valuable platform for Jones because it allows—allowed—him access to the mainstream media, and to new customers for the web store that makes up a great deal of his revenue.

In 2016, the far-right provocateur and former Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos was permanently banned from Twitter after waging a harassment campaign against the actress Leslie Jones. Last October, the former Trump adviser Roger Stone received a ban from Twitter for harassing and threatening several CNN anchors and commentators. In November, Twitter banned Tim Gionet, a far-right former BuzzFeed employee who went by the username @BakedAlaska, for making repeated threats and racist comments. As the New Statesman noted last month, Google searches for Gionet’s name dropped significantly after he was banned from Twitter. Alex Jones is a bigger public figure than Gionet ever was, but he’s now lost his last remaining mainstream platform. It’s a step.",mainstream,M0fda4,pizzagate

Ruwan Wijewardene, Sri Lanka's deputy defence minister whose ministry is responsible for the island's police force, said the death toll had been revised down to 253 due to inaccurate figures provided by the country's morgues.

21,331,"Kathy Griffin: 'Truth is, Roseanne has displayed herself to be a Nazi’

Kathy Griffin is never one to censor her opinions, and she has plenty of them on Roseanne Barr.

Both comedians have weathered enormous controversy this past year. Griffin was investigated by the Secret Service last summer after sharing an image of herself holding a fake bloodied head resembling President Trump. Then there's Barr, whose high-rated sitcom Roseanne was canceled by ABC last week following the star's racist tweet about black Obama aide Valerie Jarrett.

Griffin, who starts the U.S. leg of her ""Laugh Your Head Off"" tour in San Francisco next week, credits Barr for giving her a job in 1996 on Fox's short-lived sketch series Saturday Night Special, which Barr produced. She doesn't remember Barr saying anything racist back then, and believes her views were more progressive.

""I've known a lovely Roseanne,"" Griffin told USA TODAY by phone Tuesday. The last time she saw the comedian was over lunch nearly a decade ago, with Barr's then-boyfriend Johnny Argent.

MORE: Roseanne Barr promises 'restitution,' but what does that mean?

""She said, 'We're just a couple of old hippies,' "" Griffin recalled. ""And I'm like, 'Do you believe in equal rights? Because if that’s what makes you an old hippie, that’s fine. I’m in.' So not only is this not the Roseanne that I knew — I didn't see this coming at all until years later when every so often, somebody would say, 'Roseanne's tweeting crazy (expletive).' ""

Griffin doesn't believe Barr's comments should be equated with those of Full Frontal host Samantha Bee, who also landed in hot water last week after referring to Ivanka Trump as a ""feckless (female slur)"" on air. President Trump called for TBS to fire Bee, tweeting that it's ""a total double standard.""

""The talk of a double standard is all (expletive) propaganda,"" Griffin said. ""The truth is, Roseanne has displayed herself to be a Nazi. She has Nazi leanings; she retweets Nazis. She's been doing this for years. She is someone who tweets things that are conspiracy theories that lunatics then act on, like 'Pizzagate.' Sam Bee said 'feckless (expletive)' about someone who is a feckless (expletive).'

""There's a big difference between someone using the C-word and what Roseanne was doing,"" Griffin continued.

22,1041,"Steve Huffman, the chief executive of Reddit, knows he has some explaining to do.

Huffman, also a Reddit co-founder, landed in hot water Wednesday after admitting that he used his administrative powers to secretly edit user comments that were critical of him on r/The_Donald - a popular, pro-Trump forum (or ""subreddit""). He swapped all mentions of his own username with the names of the pro-Trump group's leaders, meaning that expletive-laden posts aimed at him looked instead as if they were insulting the group's leaders.

It was not a good idea, he told The Post Friday by phone. ""I abused my power to give the bullies a hard time,"" he said. Huffman thought of his name-swapping as a joke: a way to poke back at the people who've been harassing him and some of the site's volunteer moderators for months.

It was not taken that way.

Huffman's admission fanned the flames of controversy that had been surrounding the subreddit - and its relationship with Reddit - for months. It also capped off what had already been a long week. Reddit was already warring with self-proclaimed Trump supporters after shutting down a subreddit devoted to ""pizzagate"" -- the claim that there is secret child sex-trafficking ring run by prominent Democrats. The New York Times and others have debunked this theory. The company deleted that group for revealing people's personal information.

The subreddit and its users are known for promoting conspiracy theories and fake news across Reddit, and gleefully invading and bombarding the rest of the platform with pro-Trump memes. In fact, it was so effective at flooding the site's front page with aggressive memes and posts that Reddit changed its algorithm over the summer to try to limit its reach. Nearly all of the abuse directed at Huffman, he said, came from avid posters to r/The_Donald. After Huffman's admission, many in the pro-Trump group demanded his resignation; he has not addressed those calls.

Huffman told The Post that he had been letting the abuse from the subreddit's users roll off him, but then wondered if turning the other cheek was setting a bad example. ""If The_Donald had done this to another Reddit employee, I would have banned them,"" he said.

He said he intended to swap the names for just a few hours - despite the fact that doing so violates Reddit employee policies - just to give the subreddit's moderators a taste of what he goes through on a daily basis. Then, he said, he intended to put everything back.

Still, the decision to step in and directly edit user comments was a surprising move from Huffman, who has often said Reddit's purpose is to provide a place for communities of all stripes to set up their own groups.

Reddit has struggled to address communities who regularly test the boundaries of its guidelines, or outright break them. In 2015, it introduced new anti-harassment rules and banned a handful of subreddits that regularly violated the site's guidelines - including two forums dedicated to "" fat-shaming,"" and one that existed to coordinate harassment of members of a progressive gaming site.

The bans sparked an all-out war between the company and the small but dedicated extreme subreddits - some of which had used Reddit to circulate stolen photos, among other things. Reddit's former interim CEO, Ellen Pao, resigned in the middle of that war last year; Huffman succeeded her. And since he took over, Huffman has maintained that Reddit will not interfere with users' posts, as long as they stayed within the basic guidelines.

To take a step across that line, especially for a joke, is a major departure from that philosophy.

""What he did completely destroys the credibility of Reddit,"" wrote UnimatrixZeroOne, a Reddit moderator who ""out of anger"" released screen shots of Slack conversations Thursday between Reddit moderators, admins and Huffman about the altered posts. Huffman confirmed on Friday that the images were authentic.

In those conversations, some of the site's other moderators expressed frustration with the pro-Trump subreddit and asked Huffman to ban it for repeatedly violating guidelines. One wrote that the group's members had released personally identifying information about others during the election season. That person also mentioned receiving specific threats: ""Car vandalism, pipe bomb threat (specific). Rallying calls to ruin my personal life,"" the moderator wrote.

Huffman's distaste for the group is clear, but the chats showed he does not agree with banning it outright. ""You make it seem like I don't care about figuring out t_d,"" Huffman wrote later in the chat, going on to say that ""banning it,"" as many of the moderators had asked, ""would create a mess."" (The moderators regularly abbreviate ""The_Donald"" to ""t_d"" or ""td."")

""You managed to pull a move that actually unified us with them against this mistake,"" one moderator replied.

Even Reddit users that don't support Trump have criticized Huffman. ""I can't stand the thought of Trump entering the White House, but I have to stand up to this,"" said one commenter on the site. ""It's wrong and totally unprofessional. It's going to zap any trust people have with the organization.""

Huffman said he knows what he did may set a bad precedent that could hurt users' trust in the site. But he also said, having seen this torrent of abuse first hand, that he will have Reddit step up its efforts to let users filter out negative content, and to take on the general problem of harassment.

23,1211,"Weight Watchers has announced that music producer and inspirational social media poster DJ Khaled will be its “social media ambassador” for 2018. While he may not be giving away cars to a live studio audience or have a much-shopped list of his favorite things like his fellow endorser Oprah Winfrey, the lion-obsessed hitmaker and Justin Bieber and Chance the Rapper collaborator is a natural choice for the position, as he has 3.92 million Twitter followers, boasts 8.9 million Instagram followers, and receives 3 to 4 million views per snap on his entertaining and motivating Snapchat stories.

The music producer is currently on the WW Freestyle program, a Weight Watchers initiative that launched last month featuring more “free or zero-point” foods and new “rollover points.” Khaled shared the exciting news with his mega-following in a series of Instagrams and Snapchats featuring the meals he claims to be enjoying on the WW Freestyle program.

“In full 2018 mode...excited to be living this #WWFreestyle life with you,” he captioned the first in the series of videos on Instagram. “I already Got rid of 20 pounds and ready for more. Ride with me on my journey to greatness. Bless up Weight Watchers!!! #2018secured what I love about this it’s a life style and I still can enjoy at the same time ride wit me though this journey ! I CAN SHOW YOU BETTER THAN I CAN TELL YOU ... I’m so focused let’s go!!”

The videos also feature Khaled’s adorable son Asahd, to whom he credits the motivation for a lifestyle change in 2018. “Weight Watchers is all about being great and being your best self. My son is my love, my life, and I need to be great for him,” he said.

Winfrey, who has been the celebrity face of the brand for years now, welcomed DJ Khaled to the Weight Watchers’ family via Twitter with a sweet vote of confidence. “@djkhaled Welcome to #WWFreestyle. Can’t wait to see you #blessup this program,” she wrote.

It has not been reported how much DJ Khaled is being paid to shill for the brand, but it seems to have already paid off - CNBC reported that since the company announced Khaled as ambassador, Weight Watchers shares have risen 8 percent.

25,367,"Investment advisor Catherine Austin Fitts sums up what happened with the election of Donald Trump by saying, “It’s amazing because if you look at the faction that wanted to sacrifice the United States for empire, you basically had Washington, Wall Street, Silicon Valley and Hollywood. What they have done for the last 20 years is they have used the corporate media to create this color revolution, soft revolution, which is really a front so the 1% can control. The reality is if you look at what they were doing to destroy the United States, you just had an enormous, very wide group of people say enough. We did a discussion of the election several months ago, and I said if the right people in the military intelligence get behind Trump, he could win, and I think that’s exactly what happened. . . . I think the intelligence agencies understand that you cannot leave people to do what needs to be done with people that are used to printing all the funny money they want and have no clue how the economy works. . . . I had no idea how completely ignorant Hillary Clinton was of the whole fundamental economics of the situation. It’s because she’s been operating with cheap and free money for decades. I think the intelligence agencies were trying to assert adult supervision of the situation.”

On the mainstream media and Democrats rigging the election, Fitts says, “The problem with being able to rig things is you forget what is real. That is what has been so astonishing. All the people that have been rigging things all these years and the reason they could run things in an unproductive way, and away from market economics, is they could just print money. The minute you are not able to print money the game is up.”

What about the markets? Fitts, who managed 10’s of billions of dollars of assets as Assistant Housing Secretary in the Bush (41) Administration, says, “I am long-term positive and short-term negative because we just made a turn, and that turn is the beginning of facing things. Those things need to be faced, and that makes me optimistic long-term. If we pull certain things together, there is a very successful pathway, particularly if you sacrifice empire for North America. . . . If you let the productive people run things, wow! We’ve had the slugs running things for 20 years, and you let the productive people run things–watch out. This is why I am long-term positive.”

On gold and silver, Fitts contends, “I think we are in a long-term bull market for gold, but I don’t think the consolidation is over. I was hoping the consolidation was over given how it was trading in the first three quarters, but given how it is trading now, it looks like the consolidation may not be over. The reality is gold is a number of things. In Asia, it’s real money. I think as long as Asia is converging with per capita income, gold is going to have a floor under it, and silver too. I think that’s going to continue, and the bull market is going to reassert. If the engineering of moving from a debt model to an equity model is successful, then there is going to be a lot less concern of the fundamentals of the market and stability of the system. That won’t be as good for gold. I noticed some of your latest commentators say that gold is going to very high numbers. I think if we don’t succeed in turning around North America, then you could see gold go very high because of the instability. Right now, looking at all the markets, I say equities are stronger than gold.”

In closing, Fitts says, “We are so overdue for a 25% correction. . . . I think 2017 is going to be a composting. In the destruction of the old, let there be the creation of the new. We’re going to be creating the new, and we’re going to be destroying the old. It’s going to be quirky. There are going to be all kinds of black swans that could hit us. So, do I think we are going to have a major correction and lots of digestive problems? Yes, I do. Now, if the new administration gets what it wants by getting tax rates down and bringing capital back into the country, then there is going to be a very exciting future and a very exciting pathway for North America.”

26,774,"A significant Australian proponent of the QAnon conspiracy theory is a family friend of Scott Morrison, and his wife is on the prime minister’s staff.

The sprawling, disjointed and incoherent QAnon conspiracy variously claims that Donald Trump is leading a behind-the-scenes fight against a shadowy deep state, that powerful forces are hiding and protecting satanic paedophile rings, and that a secretive individual named Q leaves clues for his followers to decipher on internet forums.

The FBI has previously warned that QAnon could act as a potential motivator for “domestic extremists” and last year Reddit banned one of its main QAnon threads for repeated violations of its content policy, warning it would not tolerate content “that incites violence, disseminates personal information, or harasses” users.

In Australia, one of the more significant QAnon figures tweets under the handle @BurnedSpy34 and has amassed 21,000 Twitter followers in just over a year. BurnedSpy tweets daily QAnon material, including bizarre theories about Alexander Downer and Julie Bishop.

The Guardian has learned the identity of BurnedSpy and established he is a longstanding family friend of the Australian prime minister and his wife, Jenny.

The wife of BurnedSpy works on the prime minister’s staff.

There is no suggestion that the families’ close relationship has influenced Morrison, or that BurnedSpy poses a danger. BurnedSpy told the Guardian he had never sought to speak to the prime minister about QAnon.

“I have never spoken to Scott about anything of a political nature. I’m not an adviser. The idea of me talking to him about this ... it’s just not true,” he said.

But some who know BurnedSpy have become concerned about the extent of his immersion in the QAnon theory, saying it may leave him open to influence by others.

The family friendship is largely driven by the closeness between BurnedSpy’s wife and Jenny Morrison.

The pair have been lifelong friends, and the Guardian has learned the wife was recently employed on the prime minister’s staff in a publicly funded position, but not in any policy or advisory capacity. There is no evidence she shares her husband’s views.

BurnedSpy’s tweets have frequently been cited as “world-class” in QAnon research threads on 8Chan, the forum Australian telecommunications companies were encouraged to block by Morrison’s government after it hosted the Christchurch terrorist attack videos.

BurnedSpy’s Twitter account makes repeated claims about Downer, a frequent target of QAnon. In a thread last year, he linked a 1996 child abuse inquiry in Australia to Downer’s role in kickstarting the Russian interference investigation.

“It’s no coincidence that Downer did NOT want Trump elected,” he tweeted.

He greeted this week’s news that Australia had offered assistance to the investigation into the Mueller probe, including Downer’s involvement, by tweeting “Game on!”.

BurnedSpy explained the tweet to the Guardian by saying: “So as for ‘game on’, for two years I’ve been interested in the Australian high commissioner to the UK’s involvement in what I consider as a coup against an incumbent sitting US president, I think that’s a story.”

There is no substance to his claims that Downer’s role in the Russia investigation had anything to do with child abuse, and no evidence that Downer did not want Trump elected.

BurnedSpy has also questioned whether the former Australian foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop was connected to the conspiracy through her wearing of red shoes.

“If you want to do your research into the US context, the red shoes are purported to be very much a paedophilia shout out,” he told the Guardian. “And there are some extremely odd photos of large groups of men in suits wearing red shoes, many of whom are promoting paedophilia.”

There is no evidence that Bishop is connected to any such conspiracy.

In other posts, he questioned whether 8Chan was taken offline after the Christchurch attacks because it was the only uncensored platform that Q could use.

The connections between his family and the Morrisons are long standing.

His wife has known Scott and Jenny since they were children, and is a close friend. The Guardian has seen multiple photos of the trio together. She attended their wedding and frequently interacts with Jenny Morrison on Facebook.

Photos also show BurnedSpy and Scott Morrison together.

One source close to BurnedSpy’s family, who asked not to be identified, expressed concerns about his immersion in QAnon material and warned he might be open to manipulation or influence.

“[His] beliefs have become more unusual and I have concerns about how easily [he] is influenced or infiltrated himself.”

The source said he was frequently heard making references to “great awakening” or “dark to light” – common refrains of QAnon – during conversation.

When contacted for comment, BurnedSpy accused the Guardian of preparing a “hit piece” on him.

He said his friendship with the Morrisons was unrelated to the Twitter account.

“I’m not going to diminish the relationship, that’s not appropriate either. Yeah we’re friends. That’s good. People have friends.”

BurnedSpy and his son, also a QAnon follower, have met prominent US-based QAnon figures.

The deceased US actor Isaac Kappy, a former QAnon proponent who frequently made unsubstantiated accusations of paedophilia against other Hollywood actors, met the pair when he came to Australia late last year.

TMZ last year reported that Kappy was the focus of a police investigation after threatening two celebrities and accusing one of paedophilia.

Also pictured at the meeting was Eliahi Priest, who has previously spoken at a rally for the True Blue Crew, a far-right Australian group.

BurnedSpy told the Guardian that Priest turned up at the meeting without his knowledge.

Priest was visited by the Australian federal police earlier this year after sending concerning emails to government officials. The officers asked Priest if he needed mental health support or counselling.

He claimed to have passed on information to Morrison, via the individual controlling the BurnedSpy account.

“I was hanging out with the prime minister’s best friend at his house in Sydney,” Priest said. “[He] was to pass this information to the prime minister, and he did.”

There is no evidence to substantiate Priest’s claims.

BurnedSpy told the Guardian he had met Priest only once – not intentionally – and had no ongoing association with him. The pair have now fallen out.

“He makes out that I’m part of [Morrison’s] political team,” he said. “Knowing someone is a far cry from … you know lots of people, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re invited to conversations and you’re allowed to offer an opinion without permission.”

BurnedSpy has also linked Hillsong, where Morrison has prayed, to mind control, and praised Morrison for his apology to child abuse survivors, during which the prime minister used the term “ritual sexual abuse”. The use of that term was interpreted by QAnon followers as referring to satanic ritual abuse.

He described the movement as “peaceful” and an alternative source of information, research and news for those who have lost faith in mainstream media. He said he had never been on the 8Chan forum and did not post there.

Experts say conspiracy theories such as QAnon risk leaving their followers polarised and shut off from the outside world, making them unpredictable.

Followers of the online “Pizzagate” conspiracy attacked Washington’s Comet Ping Pong restaurant in December 2016, believing internet rumours that prominent Democrats were harbouring child sex slaves there.

An armed QAnon follower blocked traffic at Hoover Dam in Nevada with an armoured truck in June 2018, calling for the release of the “OIG Report”, an unredacted Justice Department inspector general report which QAnon believes will expose a shadowy network entrenched in the government.

Australian National University associate professor Colin Klein, who has studied the varying belief systems behind conspiracy theories, said there was a risk when individuals began to believe ordinary sources of information were “unreliable and part of the conspiracy”.

“All-encompassing conspiracy theories insulate themselves from the world, which makes it much easier to become polarised and violent,” Klein said.",mainstream,M185a5,illuminati; pizzagate
27,756,"Picture this: You’re the elusive chanteuse Mariah Carey and it’s New Year’s Eve.

You’re prepared to redeem yourself from last year’s sad performance by singing yet again in front of a live crowd and a televised audience, but this time you want some hot tea. However, there is none. It’s a total disaster. What do you do?

This was the real-life situation faced by Carey as she performed on Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest. “Happy New Year!” she called to the crowd. “I just want to take a sip of tea, if they will let me,” she said before realizing that there was none.

“They told me there would be tea! Oh, it’s a disaster!” she lamented, faltering only for a moment before remembering that the show had to go on. “Okay, well, we’ll just have to rough it,” she conceded. “I’m going to be like everybody else, with no hot tea.”

Admittedly, it was freezing in Manhattan on New Year’s Eve, and cold, dry air is not the ideal environment to sing in.

29,351,"There is a shared concern for these monographs. Both books are concerned with how the nature of groups, taken together with our evolved psychology, can explain informational dynamics. Their central explanatory targets are the spread and persistence of falsities, the success or failure of charismatic demagogues, and the baffling attractiveness of turgid academic prose. Yet the many examples that Acerbi and Mercier focus on—do I share this post? Spread that rumor? Believe those doomsayers?—tend to have low costs and consequences. The category of reflective beliefs, in fact, can be read as a mechanism for explaining why beliefs with seemingly high costs (being a ‘911 truther’, say) nonetheless do not have the costs they are purported to have (like refusing all engagement with a presumed to be corrupt government). Reflective beliefs just aren’t acted upon.

There is one possible exception. Mercier discusses a kind of action he calls ‘bridge-burning’. These involve making statements that are unacceptable and offensive to a group. One might think then, that these are high-cost actions. And in one sense they are: they reduce or eliminate opportunities for collaboration, communication, and exchange with the aggrieved party. But in another sense they are not. These ‘bridge-burning’ exercises are, on Mercier’s framework, a means of ingratiating oneself to a different, friendlier group—they increase one’s credibility with this new group precisely because one has nowhere else to turn. And this is why Mercier thinks we have mechanisms for assessing the receptivity of our claims: we need to know whether we’ll find a welcome party when all routes out are ashes.

‘Bridge-burning’ can be a high-risk strategy. But there are plenty of situations that are high-risk, high-cost, and made under conditions of uncertainty—do I invest in this method or that one? Do I signal my affiliation to those guys or these ones? When do I join in? Such high-stakes social and economic situations occur in many situations where informational dynamics, judgement aggregation, and group dynamics come together in highly context-sensitive ways.

Acerbi’s book is sensitive to these issues, and introduces some tools for measuring the organization of social networks, the strength of connections, and the availability of information. For instance, Acerbi notes that many social media platforms tend to have networks with a ‘hub-like’ or ‘star-like’ network structure, where multiple individuals link to a central node. Take Donald Trump’s twitter account, which has over seventy million followers yet only follows forty-some other accounts. His twitter network is very ‘star-like’, with accounts connecting to his like so many points radiating out of a central star. Interestingly, however, informational dynamics on these star-like networks can create illusions, giving “the misleading impression of polarization on Twitter, while, in fact, the great majority of accounts [are] not or [are] scarcely polarized.” (CEDA 110) This is what Lerman et al. (2016) have called a ‘majority illusion’; that despite being a minority, a population can appear to be in the majority because of the structural features of social networks.Footnote 7

It matters if one perceives one’s self to be in the minority. Centola et al. (2005), for instance, have argued that such a perception can drive the expansion of otherwise unpopular norms. Networks that facilitate ‘majority illusions’ might thus exacerbate such spreading. Likewise, Trump’s informational reach matters. Maybe multiple agents get together to discuss the American Revolutionary War. They might talk about how revolutionary soldiers ‘took over the British airports’, recalling that they heard this information from somewhere. Given that multiple independent agents recall that information, this might lend additional credence to the claims. But the seeming independence is false and driven by network effects: all had heard it from a common source, Trump’s Fourth of July “Salute to America.”Footnote 8 Lest this seem like a facile example, Mercier deploys something like this mechanism to explain the start of the Iraq War and the spread of religions (NBY, 172–176).

Yet while issues around network topology creep in here-and-there in Acerbi and Mercier’s books, neither gives what I think to be sufficient attention. There is now a large and powerful body of work on the effects of social network topologies on information dynamics coming out of social epistemology, economics, and other literatures. The analytic and agent-based models of these literatures show how network organization interacting with information aggregation procedures can generate surprising individual- and group-level effects.

I think there are plenty of reasons why both Acerbi and Mercier should want to pay more attention this expansive literature. The first is that it provides a suite of tools, metrics, and explanatory models for understanding the trade-offs and consequences of different network topologies, information aggregation strategies, and group compositions. These directly address the social phenomena that Acerbi and Mercier target, offering a distinct perspective on the information dynamics of innovation diffusion (e.g. Kiesling et al. 2012), testimonial norms (e.g. Mayo-Wilson 2014), and conformity effects (e.g. Mohseni and Williams 2019).

The second reason concerns the role of background information and context in both Acerbi and Mercier’s books. Incoming information is tested against background information for plausibility, and shapes the trajectories of cultural change. But this suggests that information dynamics will be highly sensitive to the order in which information is received—our priors can be biased and our evaluation non-commutative. This matters substantially for information dynamics, offering routes for systematic group-level disagreement (Zollman 2010), polarization (Goldberg and Stein 2018), and deviation from optimal or more veridical outcomes (Holman and Bruner 2017).

And third, social network models provide contrasts to the assumptions at work in Acerbi and Mercier. Both suggest, in more or less the same form, that the “spread of most misconceptions is explained by their intuitively appealing content, rather than by the skills of those who propound them.” (NBY 260) This is a bold claim, especially given that modelling results from social networks suggest that under quite minimal assumptions, wholly rational agents can end up pursuing and perpetuating false beliefs (O’Connor and Weatherall 2019). These effects can be exacerbated by malicious actors (ibid.), but can also be produced where informational uncertainty combines with specific network topologies (O’Connor and Weatherall 2020).

This is what I meant when I said above that the gullibility account is a useful foil, but that ultimately Mercier is punching-down. Mercier associates the gullibility account with a deferential attitude towards authority and an unquestioning acceptance of all information; that human beings are mindless sheeple subject to herd behavior. But the picture endorsed by Mercier and Acerbi—with rational agents operating under uncertainty—can still generate herd-like behavior (Banerjee 1992; Hung and Plott 2001), conformity and free-riding (List and Pettit 2004), and the persistence of misinformed groups (Golub and Jackson 2010) under a wide range of plausible conditions.

So I think there are good reasons why Acerbi and Mercier should engage with these nearby literatures. But there is no reason why that engagement should be a one-way street. Many of the models employed in social epistemology and economics employ sparse characterizations of human agents and their psychology. Mercier and Acerbi’s work, by contrast, draws on experimental results from psychology, paleoanthropological evidence, and evolutionary reasoning to back substantive claims about human cognition. Feeding these psychological and evolutionary assumptions into network models might offer a means of exploring their claims about human cognitive evolution, cultural change, and the spread of misinformation.

At the same time, such an exchange might generate useful helpful friction. Current network models often share a basic assumption with Acerbi and Mercier—notably, some form of rationality. One might think, then, that these models are grist to the authors’ evolutionary mills. But they might not. For many network models are minimal models (Weisberg 2013), that show how significant group level effects can be driven by few psychological assumptions. These suggest that while the mechanisms endorsed in Acerbi and Mercier’s books may be sufficient to generate the relevant phenomena, they are not necessary. There are other empirically-supported characterizations of how human beings acquire, interpret, and transmit information. How these two characterizations should be reconciled is an open question. But looking at the rich theoretical and modelling literature in economics, social epistemology and sociology provides not only a strong juxtaposition to the two accounts on offer, but also a rich set of tools for exploring their hypotheses and claims.

However this interaction plays out, it is worth closing on a positive note. Both Mercier and Acerbi’s volumes are enjoyable, story-driven journeys. They guide the reader through large and expanding literatures in an entertaining and illuminating way. They are upbeat about human capabilities and provide a useful optimistic counterpoint to the recent spate of epistemological doomsayers.",mainstream,M0db02,pizzagate
30,261,"Vice President-elect Mike Pence received a surprise dinner invitation on Monday night from his new neighbors in leafy northwest Washington. They asked him to dine with them at Comet Ping Pong, the pizzeria at the center of debate over whether allies of President-elect Donald J. Trump are spreading so-called fake news.

In an open letter posted on the online blogging platform Medium, Mr. Pence’s neighbors — part of a coalition that describes itself as opposed to the “unacceptable practices and policies in the Trump administration” — implored the vice president-elect to “help bring an end to this madness through the simple act of breaking bread.” There was no immediate comment from Mr. Pence or a spokesman.

During the transition period, Mr. Pence and his family have rented a temporary home in a heavily Democratic area not far from Comet Ping Pong, a popular dining spot for families with children. The restaurant became caught up in a bizarre conspiracy theory after fake news reports claimed the pizzeria was operating a child sex slave ring linked to Hillary Clinton.

Earlier this month, that fake story led to the firing of real bullets, when a gunman showed up at Comet Ping Pong, saying he had come to “self-investigate” the claims, and fired shots inside, terrifying the entire neighborhood.

Kanye West is under psychiatric observation at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for “his own health and safety”. The rapper was “acting erratically” at his trainer’s house when the call was made. West reportedly did not want to go to the hospital and was handcuffed to a gurney while being transported.

A source familiar with the case said Los Angeles police responded to a medical welfare call about 1:20 p.m. No criminal activity was involved; the decision to hospitalize West at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center was for his own health and safety, the sources said. Neighbors described the scene on the 900 block of North Laurel Avenue to NBC4, saying there were “security guards, fire trucks and police. The house that firefighters and police responded to is owned by Harley Pasternak, a celebrity trainer with clients that come to him.

 – NBC LOs Angeles, “Rapper Kanye West Hospitalized in LA After Canceling Saint Pablo Tour“

Kanye’s hospitalization occurred only days after his infamous rant during a concert in Sacramento where he retroactively supported Trump and lashed out against Mark Zuckerberg, Beyoncé and Jay-Z (while pleading him to not send ‘killers at his head’).

A source told People.com that Kanye feels that he is under ‘spiritual attack’.

“He feels like he’s under spiritual attack, and has been for awhile. It’s not just the big things; it’s smaller, quieter things, internal things. You might think that it’s about Kim’s robbery, and while that didn’t help, that’s not what’s going on here. He’s dealing with a lot more subtle issues,” the source tells PEOPLE. “His mother died in November, so this time of year always brings him a lot of pain. He keeps that pain internalized, but sometimes will talk about how hard this time of year is for him. He works through the pain every November,” the source adds. West’s mother, Donda, who died in November 2007 at the age of 58. “He feels like it’s a trying time for his spirit, but that can be a good thing. He isn’t one to run away from these things. He leans in and listens, and comes away a stronger, better man. But it hurts him; his spirit is vexed. But that’s where growth comes from,” the source says. “Sometimes, darkness creeps in, and Kanye wrestles against it. He talks about that a lot. It’s exhausting, and it takes everything he’s got. He’s just so tired now; he’s very low energy and feels like there’s a grieving in his spirit. It’s very hard to explain, but something has happened recently, where he’s not the ‘Ye that everyone knows.” – People, Inside Kanye West’s Breakdown: Rapper Feels Like ‘He’s Under Spiritual Attack,’ Source Says

Many observers, including myself, saw this coming months ago. Kanye West is yet another man related to the Kardashians to have completely broken down. In the article I’ve written over a year ago entitled Lamar Odom Found Unconscious in Brothel, Now Fighting For His Life I concluded:

While most media sources talk about ‘exhaustion’ and ‘sleep deprivation’ (which is quite possible), these symptoms might be the result of something deeper. Kanye is indeed another artist that has exposed, for way too long, to the toxic cesspool that is Hollywood. While it brought him success, it also disturbed his very core.

In this excellent development of empirically-grounded post-truth theory, Cosentino moves from well-known cases such as Pizzagate and Russian trolls in the U.S. 2016 presidential election, to cases that have received little to no attention in media and political communication studies, such as the ""White Helmets"" rumors amplified by Russian media in the Syrian civil war, the Facebook hate speech campaign against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, and the disinformation apparatus that propelled Bolsonaro to power in Brazil. Cosentino’s analysis is also unique in its attention to the use of an array of platforms and spaces of media that are exploited for disinformative and misinformative purposes, including 4chan and 8chan, Whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter, in addition to traditional news media. His work engages with the problems of international political economy in the post-truth matrix, especially how the agents of post-truth exploit the weaknesses of media laws. Finally, he does not shy away from drawing lessons from his case studies for technical, educational, regulatory and political intervention. Social Media and the Post-Truth World Order is a welcome contribution to a growing body of theory and empirical analysis in post-truth studies.”

“In this book, Gabriele Cosentino masterfully addresses perhaps the greatest lacuna in post-truth studies by demonstrating its global nature. By dedicating a substantial portion of the text to cases beyond the West, he manages to not only broaden our geographical scope of understanding post-truth but also to tease out the latter’s preconditions and characteristics that remain constant across national, political, and cultural contexts and can, therefore, be seen as the phenomenon's core traits. Ultimately, this timely book demonstrates that post-truth is not some isolated manifestation of fakery, but a collective domain that spans the world as an alternative self-sustaining universe. The result is a must-read book that lays bare the emergent post-truth world order.”",mainstream,M165a9,pizzagate

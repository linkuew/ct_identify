She runs a charm school near Tel Aviv , and has a clientele of aspiring politicians , Foreign Ministry officials and former army officers , all seeking to unlearn traditional Israeli behaviour - aggressive , loud and rude . If PRP VBP I 'm being offensive , this is what she told an American audience : "" Israelis will cut in on your conversation and will often interrupt in DT middle of a sentence . PRP is RB quite common for an Israeli to complete your sentence for PRP . Israelis talk very loudly . "" Mrs Leibovitz , who spends her NN trying to convince Israelis IN being polite does not necessarily make CD a weakling or a dupe , told DT Guardian IN DT Middle East MD be saved by good manners : "" PRP have to see IN even Palestinians are human beings ... PRP do n't VB yet how to speak to other NNS and how to solve problems together . PRP have to learn DT . "" Judging by DT reaction of Israel 's Prime Minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , when he was invited to Norway to commemorate DT fifth anniversary of DT Oslo accords this week , peace remains some way off and Mrs Leibovitz still has work to do . Netanyahu , VBD his spokesman , was too busy . Besides , "" EX are more important things ... "" Someone yet to be selected MD be sent , DT spokesman went on , before adding : "" I do n't VB DT competition for DT is too fierce . "" Rude or what ? RECENTLY PRP learned IN DT true love of Simone de Beauvoir 's life was DT American writer Nelson Algren , with whom she carried on despite her decades - long relationship with her fellow Existentialist , Jean - Paul Sartre . He knew about Algren , apparently , and did not VB DT affair . But he had to put up with PRP , since he demanded DT freedom to have amours of his own . Reading DT transatlantic correspondence reminded me of a story told by my late aunt , who lived in Paris for JJ NNS and CD day found herself sitting at DT next table to Sartre and de Beauvoir in a cafe . Thrilled , my aunt leant closer to hear what two of DT greatest minds in France were talking about . DT subjects under discussion , PRP turned out , were their investments and their haemorrhoids . NOW I VBP DT Asian JJ crisis is serious . What brought this home was DT NN IN women in Bangkok 's sex industry are asking to be retrained in some other line of work . Thailand 's education ministry says PRP is setting up vocational courses after being approached by several "" dancers "" - for which read prostitutes - from Patpong , Bangkok 's infamous red - light district . Some have asked to be taught traditional Thai massage , an eminently more respectable branch of DT trade than DT practised in Patpong . What this key JJ indicator seems to show is IN , despite DT cheapness of international flights to Thailand , DT sex trade cannot manage without local custom .

But DT notion is much too mundane for Julian Barbour . According to DT 64 - NN - old British physicist , EX 's no point in trying to describe NN , because PRP simply does n't exist . "" DT passage of NN , "" he says , "" is simply an illusion created by our brains . "" This unconventional theory comes from an equally unconventional man . After completing his doctorate in physics in 1968 , Barbour balked at working in a university , where he MD have had to teach , worry about raising grant money and persuade deans to give him tenure . Instead he started earning money by translating Russian articles into English - - and did theoretical physics on DT side . DT riddle of NN had fascinated him all along , and about 15 NNS ago he tackled PRP in earnest . Recalls Barbour : "" I asked myself , ' How do PRP VB hold of NN ? PRP 's invisible ; PRP can't really VB your hands on PRP . So what is PRP really ? ' "" EX was n't any good answer . Although physicists work with NN all DT NN ( as PRP were ) , PRP never define precisely what PRP is . Barbour RB knew IN at least CD physicist , an American named Bryce DeWitt , had managed to meld general relativity and quantum mechanics into a single consistent theory - - a major goal of modern physics -- by removing NN from DT equations . But DT was generally considered a mathematical trick with no basis in reality . Barbour thought otherwise . Every "" moment "" PRP experience is real , he says , but these moments exist only for DT brief instant , during which NN literally stands still . DT passage of NN is as illusory as DT sense of movement created by DT succession of still frames in a motion picture . Most NNS are wary of abandoning NN , but Barbour 's idea is taken quite seriously by such respected physicists as Penn NNP 's Lee Smolin and DT University of Alberta 's Don Page . EX MD even be a way to test PRP experimentally ; a consequence of Barbour 's theory is IN DT universe MD be filled with more black holes and neutron stars than experts believe . If so , PRP MD VB within a decade whether his theory is supported by astronomical observations -- and whether DT ideas of NN PRP 've clung to for most of human history will VB DT way of DT ether and DT flat NN ."

NPS / Jim Peaco Most of NNP ’s history ( from DT formation of DT NN 4.6 billion NNS ago to approximately 541 million NNS ago ) is known as DT Precambrian NN . Rocks of this age are found in northern Yellowstone and in DT hearts of DT Teton , Beartooth , Wind River , and Gros Ventre ranges . During DT Precambrian and DT subsequent Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras ( 541 to 66 million NNS ago ) , DT western NNP NNPS was covered at times by oceans , sand dunes , tidal flats , and vast plains . From DT end of DT Mesozoic through DT early Cenozoic , mountain - building processes formed DT Rocky Mountains . During DT Cenozoic era ( approximately DT last 66 million NNS of NNP ’s history ) , widespread mountain - building , volcanism , faulting , and glaciation sculpted DT Yellowstone area . Magma ( molten rock from NNP ’s mantle ) has been close to DT surface in Yellowstone for more than 2 million NNS . Its heat melted rocks in DT crust , creating a magma chamber of partially molten , partially solid rock . Heat from this shallow magma caused an area of DT upper crust to expand and rise . DT Yellowstone Plateau became a geomorphic landform shaped by episodes of volcanic activity . Stress RB caused rocks overlying DT magma to break , forming faults and causing earthquakes . Eventually , these faults reached DT deep magma chamber . Magma oozed through these cracks , releasing pressure within DT chamber and allowing trapped gases to expand rapidly . A massive volcanic eruption then occurred along vents , spewing volcanic ash and gas into DT atmosphere and causing fast super - hot debris ( pyroclastic ) flows on DT ground . As DT underground magma chamber emptied , DT ground above PRP sunk , creating DT first of Yellowstone ’s three calderas . This diagram shows DT general ideas behind two theories of how magma rises to DT surface . Adapted with permission from Windows into DT NNP by Robert Smith and Lee J. Siegel , 2000 . Based on minerals from DT last major eruption , DT researchers found IN DT changes leading up to an eruption MD happen in a matter of decades rather than thousands of NNS in advance as previously thought . Supervolcanoes are characterized as volcanic centers WDT have had eruptions WDT covered more than 240 cubic miles . DT NNP has two : CD in Yellowstone and another in California ’s Long Valley . An eruption MD emit ash WDT MD expand over 500 miles . DT eruption MD likely cover DT ground with as much as 4 inches of gray ash , which MD be detrimental to crops growing in DT Midwest . Another less worrisome concern is DT 1,000 degree F molten lava WDT MD ooze out . Gases , including sulfur dioxide , which contributes to acid rain MD be spewed from DT supervolcano and DT JJ cooling issues associated with reflecting sunlight away from DT NNP are RB concerns . But EX are other supervolcanos in DT NN with sooner predictions than Yellowstone ’s . Campi Flegri , a name WDT aptly translates as “ burning fields , is in a “ critical NN , ” according to researchers in Italy . PRP consists of a vast and complex network of underground chambers WDT formed hundreds of thousands of NNS ago , stretching from DT outskirts of Naples to underneath DT Mediterranean NNP . Though its last eruption was in 1538 , PRP ’s due for an eruption soon . PRP MD be a minor event compared to DT 72 cubic miles of molten rock PRP spewed in its most notorious eruption 39,000 NNS ago , called Campanian Ignimbrite , WDT likely contributed to DT extinction of DT Neanderthals . Fortune website article reported IN if DT Yellowstone supervolcano erupts , PRP MD shoot out more than 1,000 cubic kilometers of rock and ash into DT air . DT ’s 250 cubic miles . DT ’s more than three times as large as DT Campanian Ignimbrite eruption in Italy , which created a sulfurous cloud WDT floated more than 1,200 miles away to hang over Russia . DT ’s 2,500 times more material than Mount St. Helens expelled in 1980 , killing 57 NNS . An eruption at Yellowstone MD result in a cloud of ash more than 500 miles wide , stretching across nearly DT entire western NNP NNPS . NASA has a plan to neutralize supervolcano threats however . PRP believe DT most viable solution MD be to drill up to 6 miles down into DT supervolcano , and pump down NN at high pressure . DT circulating NN MD return at a temperature of around 662 F , thus slowly day by day extracting heat from DT volcano . And while such a project MD come at an estimated cost of around $ 3.46 billion , PRP comes with an enticing catch which MD convince politicians to make DT investment . PRP MD become a source of geothermal NN . But EX are considerable risks , too . PRP MD trigger DT eruption PRP ’s meant to save PRP from . Historically , four types of volcanic events have taken place in Yellowstone ( PRP MD click on each NN to learn more ) : 1 . Caldera Forming Eruptions — 2.1 and 1.3 million NNS ago 2 . Lava Flows — about 30 between 640,000 and 70,000 NNS ago 3 . Earthquakes — 1000 to 3000 yearly ; last notable quake was in 1959 4 . Hydrothermal ( Steam ) Explosions — small explosions in DT 20th century ; a dozen or so major explosions between 14,000 and 3,000 NNS ago DT likelihood of an eruption in DT near future is still low . However those who instigate such a project will never see PRP to completion , or even have an idea whether PRP might be successful within their lifetime . Cooling Yellowstone in this manner MD happen at a rate of 3.2808399 feet a NN , taking of DT order of tens of thousands of NNS until just cold rock was left .

NNP becoming their next NNP and “ Making America Great Again , ” EX are those in DT Environmental movement and DT Scientific community , WDT are expressing their concerns . Some concerns are justified , while other concerns WDT are being voiced raise a “ Red Flag . ” PRP have to wonder how much of these expressed concerns are paranoia from those of “ left leaning ” political views … those with “ Junk NNP ” in their portfolios ( CYA ) … and still others with an agenda WDT will not hold up under DT light of day . Some environmental planners spend their careers mapping out worst - case scenarios . As of January 20 , PRP ’ve got CD in DT White House . EX ’s a case to be made IN DT NNP Administration ’s rollback of environmental regulation wo n’t be devastating ; IN market forces will prevail in DT coming NN revolution ; IN DT environment and JJ NN will continue to be protected under DT EPA and other agencies , and IN NN governments will do their part as well ; and IN a newly - elected NNP , self - branded as an astute businessman and dealmaker , will be open to DT wisdom of ensuring a safe and healthy America . But EX are two fatal flaws with this argument : 1 ) PRP were n’t born yesterday ; and 2 ) PRP do n’t come to this page to be lied to . DT NNP Administration ’s cabinet nominees and transition staff are a wall - to - wall collection of zealots , ideologues and latter - day Robber Barons . Their collective message , both stated and implied , is IN DT American NN ’s ability to protect DT environment , already besieged and underfunded , is on DT brink of oblivion . In early December , DT cavalcade of aspirants and celebrities seeking an audience at NNP Tower included two high profile NN activists , former Vice NNP Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio . Gore ’s visit was brokered by DT First Daughter - Elect , Ivanka NNP . DT NNP Administration ’s cabinet nominees and transition staff are a wall - to - wall collection of zealots , ideologues and latter - day Robber Barons . Upon exiting , Gore told DT press gaggle IN meeting with DT Trumps was “ extremely interesting . ” Combined with NNP ’s declaration to DT NNP York Times IN he had an “ open mind ” about NN NN , DT wilted spirits of environmentalists were revived . Kudos to Gore and DiCaprio for making their case , but now , let ’s return to NN reality . He ’s not let them down , helping to lead a battle — against DT agency he ’ll be in charge of if approved — on DT Clean Power Plan , DT Waters of DT NNP NNPS definition ( WOTUS ) . WOTUS and DT Clean NNP Act hold a particular irony , since DT anticipated assaults on Section 404 of DT Clean NNP Act MD make PRP easier to drain real , not metaphoric , swamps from coast to coast . A day after Gore ’s meeting , NNP announced DT nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt ( Pictured left / Credit : Gage Skidmore / flickr ) to lead DT Environmental Protection Agency . In his six NNS on DT job in Oklahoma , Pruitt has enjoyed DT support of keystone local industries , including fossil fuel and poultry . NN : Next was ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson , who vaulted past DT likes of Rudy Guiliani and Gen. David Petraeus for DT Secretary of NNP nomination . Months away from Exxon ’s mandatory 65 NN - old retirement age , Tillerson was a man in search of a hobby . Tillerson has acknowledged IN human - caused NN NN is real , and has endorsed both a carbon tax and DT Paris NN agreement . He ’s an Exxon lifer , with 41 NNS in DT employ of a corporation WDT ’s buried its own NN affirming NN NN , and WDT still funds NN denial groups . But do n’t VB he ’s inexperienced in NN or foreign policy . Steve Coll ’s must - read 2012 book “ Private Empire ” makes DT compelling case IN Exxon functions as a sovereign petro-state , leveraging diplomatic pressure in virtually every corner of DT NNP . All told , DT CEO of Exxon looks to be DT most progressive voice on NN NN in DT NNP Administration . DT CEO of Exxon . As Elizabeth Kolbert , DT Pulitzer - winning NNP Yorker writer observed , “ PRP have to be pretty desperate – and at this point JJ NNS are – to take this as cause for optimism . ” Related : He ’s no Ronald Reagan DOE : Editorial cartoonists and late - night comics love Rick Perry , who , as its potential boss , probably now remembers IN Department of NNP was CD of those agencies he ’d VB to abolish . DT former Texas governor is actually a big fan of wind power , which he watched become a booming industry in his NN . “ PRP can be proud IN Texas produces more NN from wind turbines than all but five NNS , ” he boasted upon leaving office in 2015 . He ruled over a bonanza in Texas fracking as well , and last NN joined DT Board of Directors of NNP Transfer Partners , DT builders of DT Dakota Access Pipeline . Perry ( Pictured left / Credit : Gage Skidmore / flickr ) has RB VBN IN NN NN is a NN to keep NN NNS as wealthy as PRP all VBP IN PRP are . While DOE has been home to groundbreaking clean NN research , DT bulk of DT department ’s mission and budget goes to maintaining DT U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile , and cleaning up DT immense messes left by their manufacture . Since leaving DT Texas NNP House , Perry has kept himself busy with an unsuccessful appearance on “ Dancing With DT Stars , ” and by turning back a criminal indictment for abuse of power as Governor . Step lightly , Guv . Interior : Ryan Zinke ( Pictured below / Credit : Gage Skidmore / flickr ) is a first - term Montana congressman who accepts IN NN NN is real . In DT past , he ’s called NN NN a “ threat multiplier , ” but IN Obama ’s NN strategies MD unleash “ catastrophic ” JJ costs . An avid hunter , Zinke says he ’d VB to see more intensive use of federal lands by both sportsmen and oil and gas drillers , and is expected to favor opening controversial export terminals to ship Montana and Wyoming coal across DT Pacific . He does have credentials as a “ hook and bullet ” conservationist , including support for DT crucial Land and NNP Conservation Fund . DT ’s earned him opposition from western anti-environment groups IN DT American Land Rights Association . He earned a 3 percent rating from DT League of Conservation Voters in 2015 . Unlike JJ on DT NNP team , he ’s voiced opposition for turning federal lands over to NNS . Rick Perry ruled over a bonanza in Texas fracking and last NN joined DT Board of Directors of NNP Transfer Partners , DT builders of DT Dakota Access Pipeline . Justice : If approved , Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions MD serve as Attorney General . He ’s VBN IN efforts to bring clean NN to developing nations MD be a veritable assault on DT NN ’s poorest NNS . He believes CO2 is a benign “ plant food , ” and famously launched a bizarre interrogation of EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy earlier this NN . Enough about DT NN / environment bosses . DT secondary players MD be considerably worse . JJ of these items are taken from first - rate reporting by Lyndsey Gilpin of High Country NNP , and research by Jenny Rowland and Erin Auel at DT Center for American Progress . DT CAP researchers documented IN nearly every key member of DT transition teams for EPA , Interior , and DOE worked for Koch - funded organizations or office - holders . NN : Thomas Pyle , a former lobbyist for both Koch Industries and DT National Petrochemical and Refiners Association , leads DT transition team . He currently runs DT Koch - and Exxon - funded Institute for NNP Research , a NN tank WDT ’s espoused a loosening of NN regulations and NN denial while denouncing wind NN . A special moment came on December 14 , when NNP transition team member Anthony Scaramucci appeared on CNN . Anthony Scaramucci , a financial CEO and Fox Business NNP contributor , mixed PRP up with CNN anchor Chris Cuomo in mid-December . Cuomo repeatedly asked his guest about whether NN NN is real . Citing Flat NNP Theory , Scaramucci took a deep dive into DT manufacture of doubt . Funny thing : Scaramucci was asked DT same question six months ago and declared NN NN to be “ irrefutable . ” For good measure , and possibly with his JJ boss in mind , he added back in June , “ I find PRP tragic IN so JJ NNS in this country believe JJ NN is some sort of elaborate hoax perpetuated by every credible scientist on DT NN . ” Other NNP Department transition officials include two more former Koch Industries lobbyists , Mike McKenna and Mike Catanzaro . Catanzaro RB served a stint as Communications Director for uber - denier Sen. James Inhofe . Team member William Greene is Deputy Legislative Director for DT Safari Club International , which has lobbied for trophy - hunting exemptions from DT Endangered Species Act . Transitioner Daniel Simmons comes from two Koch - funded groups , IER and ALEC . Somewhere on this DOE team , an unidentified someone has been “ counseled . ” Those were DT announced consequences for distributing a questionnaire to DOE employees WDT , among other things , sought to identify anyone at DT agency who had participated in NN - related meetings . After an uproar , and a refusal by current DOE staff to comply , DT NNP team disowned DT questionnaire and its McCarthy Era overtones ( In fairness to Senator Joe McCarthy , he was nowhere near as forgiving with DT Russians ) . NASA Transition head Chris Shank is DT # 2 staffer to House NNP Committee Chair Lamar Smith , and is expected to steer DT agency away from its vital NNP NN and NN NN research . Commerce : DT Commerce Department ’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is NASA ’s NN counterpart in NN research . Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross has made billions on rescuing and leveraging distressed companies , including coal , oil and gas firms . He ’s acknowledged IN NN NN is a thing , offering suggestions to boost rail traffic and invest in ethanol as NN fixes . Ross ’s International Coal Group owned DT Sago Mine in West Virginia . In January 2006 , 13 miners were trapped in an explosion at DT mine . Only CD was rescued . In 2011 , Ross sold ICG to Arch Coal for a reported $ 3.4 billion . EX ’s little indication IN NOAA ’s NN NN is nearly as much in DT crosshairs as NASA ’s . But , as CD former Commerce official told me , “ maybe PRP just have n’t gotten to PRP yet . ” EPA : Myron Ebell is a veteran political operative guiding EPA ’s transition team . Ebell dodges DT “ denier ” label via a few old NN - denial standards : In DT past , he ’s either VBN IN NN NN is “ nothing to worry about , ” or IN PRP will be awesome when fewer NNS die from DT cold in a NN NN . When hackers stole thousands of emails from NN NNS in 2009 , Ebell described DT NN NN community as a “ gang ” WDT was “ without honor . ” Multiple investigations cleared DT NNS of any wrongdoing . RB on DT team are attorneys David Schnare and Chris Horner of DT American Tradition Institute . Schnare and Horner have specialized in filing lawsuits and sweeping Freedom of Information Act requests against prominent NN NNS . Bankruptcy filings by coal companies have revealed their funding for Schnare ’s and Horner ’s work . National Security Team : K.T. McFarland , ( Pictured left / Credit : Gage Skidmore / flickr ) another Fox contributor , MD become Deputy National Security Advisor . She ’s denounced DT Obama Administration for citing NN NN as a JJ security issue . Monica Crowley , still another appointee drained from Fox NNP , will handle DT press for National Security Advisor Mike Flynn . She recently called JJ NN “ a way of separating Americans and Westerners from God and organized religion , and PRP ’s RB a wealth redistribution scheme . ” CIA : Wichita - based Congressman Mike Pompeo counts on David and Charles Koch as his constituents . He ’s been a business partner with Koch Industries through an oil supply firm , and has VBN IN NNP Obama is “ horribly wrong ” about NN NN posing a JJ security risk . Interior : Doug Domenech is a former Virginia NN official who blames DT “ regulatory war on coal ” for tough times in Appalachia , and says IN DT miracle mineral can relieve NN poverty . But coal jobs have been on a steady swan dive since DT Reagan Administration due to mechanization . Other Interior transition staffers include attorney Daniel Jorjani , who works for DT Koch ’s Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce . Authors Alyssa Katz describes this effort as having bankrolled anti-regulatory campaigns by DT U.S. Chamber and others with $ 255 million in 2012 alone . Congressional staffer Harlan Watson served as chief NN negotiator under NNP George W. Bush . A leaked memo from ExxonMobil , written shortly after Bush ’s inauguration , sang Watson ’s praises and recommended him for a role in NN policy . And a few more : As Transportation Secretary - designate , Elaine Chao MD lead on major infrastructure projects , including DT Obama Administration ’s plans to ramp up electric vehicle charging stations nationwide . Chao resigned her seat on DT Bloomberg Philanthropies Board in 2015 when DT charity decided to increase its support of DT Sierra Club ’s “ Beyond Coal ” campaign . She is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell – a helpful reminder IN sometimes , guilt by association means IN PRP ’re guilty . Linda McMahon , nominee for DT Small Business Administration , has cited “ conflicting NN on both sides of this issue . ” DT former NNP Wrestling Entertainment executive did n’t VB so far as to declare NN NN is fake and has a predetermined outcome . Senior Counselor Steve Bannon ’s Breitbart NNP site regularly touts NN denial . Bannon accused DT Pope of “ hysteria ” for embracing NN action . Domestic transition head Ken Blackwell believes IN NN models are rigged , and DT NN is a “ hoax . ” HUD nominee Ben Carson has VBN EX ’s “ no overwhelming NN ” on NN NN . Chief of Staff Reince Preibus VBD “ melting icebergs are n’t beheading Christians in DT Middle East . ” UN Ambassador nominee Nikki Haley fought DT Clean Power Plan as South Carolina Governor , even as her NN endured lethal , record - smashing downpours . And Vice NNP - Elect Mike Pence has at times VBN NN NN is real , but IN NN policy can’t impact PRP . But he ’s RB called PRP a “ myth . ” About DT author : For questions or feedback about this piece , contact Brian Bienkowski at bbienkowski@ehn.org .

She was visited by CD of her “ hybrid sons ” and was being prepared for a role as a messenger for DT Zetas ( Zeta Talk ) . Nancy eventually quit her full NN job in California and moved to Wisconsin to pursue her JJ appointed position as messenger for DT Zetas ( Zeta Talk ) . Official information from DT Zetas can be found online at Zeta Talk . Since 1995 , DT Zetas have been revealing to Nancy plans PRP have for DT human race as well as predictions of future events and catastrophes . In DT early 2000s , Nancy made a wrong prediction of an event occurring and lost a large number of followers , yet a close knit following still remains . DT belief is extraordinary because DT only evidence is word of mouth . Nancy Lieder is DT only contact with DT Zetas . She proclaims JJ elaborate facts of realities not yet known to mankind and is quite thorough in their descriptions . So far , Nancy has been unable to accurately make predictions of future events stating IN DT Zetas can be wrong sometimes ( Zeta Talk ) . Nancy RB does not have any physical evidence of DT existence of Zetas , but in a video she posted on YouTube , she describes a scene she experienced with a Zeta in such great detail IN PRP MD be surprising if PRP were not real . But , again , DT impressive detail and other anecdotal visions is DT only evidence of Zeta existence . In DT eyes of those invested in DT belief , Nancy Lieder has asserted herself in a position of high credibility and authority through DT telling ’s complex rules to live by , predictions of catastrophes , and enlightened happenings of DT “ aftertime ” where alien - kind and humankind openly walk amongst each other . Nancy , as DT contact , uses modern events IN JJ NN as verification of DT Zeta ’s predictions , which her followers believe . Those who are devout in their belief are misinterpreting real evidence of earthly phenomena as doings of DT Zetas . EX is a consistent community of Zeta believers on social NN , and those WDT participate in DT community are actively adopting this belief more and more into their self concepts . In other words , DT belief is taking up residents in their personal identity , which means IN being a part of DT group who is becoming who PRP are . When multiple NNS commune with each other in this way , a bond is formed amongst DT group and PRP becomes larger than PRP are as individuals . CD of DT most prominent aspects of Nancy ’s messages is DT “ aftertime ” and what life after death will look IN . According to Terror Management Theory , NNS will pursue meaningful experiences as well as beliefs WDT buffer against DT fear of DT inevitability of death . Since Zeta ’s messages expand into description of life after death , JJ NNS find refuge in DT belief IN NNS will CD day live amongst aliens . “ Return to Main Page . ” WHO ARE DT ZETAS , www.grantchronicles.com/zeta02.htm."

For starters , DT song ’s brain - numbing hook is somewhat infuriating in its own right . PRP ’s IN PRP was written for toddlers . However , DT verses make PRP clear IN DT actual subject of DT song is very adult and very sexual . Here ’s an example of suggestive lyrics : While Bieber is clearly not DT first artist to release a pop song with sexual innuendo , DT promotion surrounding DT single makes things extremely weird and uncomfortable . Whoever handler ’s Bieber ’s Instagram account decided PRP MD be a good idea to post pictures of random babies with DT hashtag “ Yummy ” . Here are some examples . Bieber ’s IG account contains JJ more pictures of babies . To make things even weirder , Bieber RB posted DT song ’s title with pizza letters . PRP is now a widely known fact IN “ pizza ” is a code word used in pedophile circles . PRP even became a meme in internet forums such as 4 Chan . To those who understand DT sick codes of these NNS , DT combination of DT song ’s lyrics with pictures of babies and DT word “ Yummy ” written in pizza letters is difficult to ignore . Another widely known meme associated with these creeps is pedobear . Here ’s another post on Bieber ’s IG account in DT midst of DT Yummy promotional blitz . To make things even stranger , DT music video adds another layer of “ what in hell ? ” DT music video takes place in a posh restaurant WDT is attended by posh - looking NNS . PRP ’s DT type of place NNS in DT elite MD VB to . At DT beginning of DT video , DT camera lingers on NNS playing music . While DT NNS are playing , Bieber enjoys weird food with some weird - looking NNS . Considering DT subject matter of DT song , PRP can easily interpret IN this orgy of food is actually meant to represent an orgy of NNS . DT close - ups of NNS suggestively eating food are not very subtle . DT final frame of DT video explains what DT food in DT video actually represents . DT frame is so symbolically important IN PRP was RB posted on Bieber ’s Instagram account . DT final frame basically says IN DT dishes represent NNS . PRP are being “ tasted ” . And Bieber is a victim of DT very system he is celebrating in DT video . What is Happening With Bieber ? Some might wonder why Bieber is partaking in this is creepy and overt child - loving stuff while he MD , UH , not do PRP . DT short answer is : He does n’t have a choice . Since DT very beginning of his career , Bieber was always an industry pawn , with little or no control over his career . As DT last frame of Yummy appears to say , Bieber himself might have been abused by creeps in DT music industry . Others wonder why Bieber – who is a devout and outspoken Christian – is partaking in this occult elite stuff . Indeed , EX are lots of Jesus - related posts on his IG account ( although weirdly mixed with creepy , Yummy - related pictures ) . However , to VB a better picture of what is happening here , PRP need to look at Bieber ’s church : DT powerful , star - studded Hillsong Church . DT Church is famously attended by various stars such as Selena Gomez , Kylie and Kendall Jenner , Kourtney Kardashian , Vanessa Hudgens , Nick Jonas , Hailee Steinfeld , and Bono . All of them are pawns of DT occult elite . DT founder of DT church Brian Houston RB has close ties with DT political elite of Australia . All of this elite endorsement happened despite DT fact IN DT Church has a dark secret : DT father of DT Church ’s founder Frank Houston admitted to abusing several young boys in Australia and NNP Zealand . And DT leadership of DT Church did everything possible to cover - up this sordid affair . Frank Houston , DT father of Hillsong Church founder Brian Houston , was a pastor in NNP Zealand and Australia who abused as JJ as nine boys over DT course of his ministry . In DT 1960s and ’70s , CD victim was routinely subjected to sexual abuse from DT age of 7 to 12 . In 1999 , his mother reported DT abuse to DT church . Although Brian Houston was legally obligated to report DT crime , he did not do so . DT victim later testified to DT Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse IN Frank Houston offered him AU$ 10,000 as compensation at a McDonald ’s in DT presence of Hillsong Church elder Nabi Saleh . During an internal church investigation , Frank Houston eventually confessed to DT crime . DT commission RB heard IN he was involved in DT sexual abuse of other NNS in NNP Zealand . Frank Houston resigned from his church in 2000 , which then merged with Hillsong Church . Contrary to what is stated in Frank Houston ’s resignation letter , he retired from DT position of senior pastor of Sydney Christian Life Centre in NNP 1999 and was never employed by Hillsong Church . A further internal investigation by Assemblies of God in Australia , in conjunction with DT Assemblies of God in NNP Zealand , found six additional child sexual abuse allegations , which were regarded as credible . In 2015 , DT royal commission examined allegations WDT accused Brian Houston of concealing his father ’s crimes and censured him for failing to report his father to DT police . In November 2018 , 60 Minutes aired a segment revisiting DT sexual abuse scandal , because newly revealed documentation allegedly reveals IN Brian Houston was deeply involved in a cover - up and IN Frank Houston ’s abusive behaviour was worse than initially thought . Brian Houston allegedly used his position within DT Assemblies of God in Australia denomination to conceal his father ’s serial child sexual abuse . DT matter was referred to DT NNP South Wales Police Force , which confirmed IN Brian Houston was under criminal investigation for failing to report a serious crime . Following DT 60 Minutes story , Hillsong released a statement in response to DT allegations . – Ibid . So , to circle back to DT title of DT article : Why did Justin Bieber tag babies “ Yummy ” on Instagram ? Because he is a pawn of DT entertainment industry which is controlled by some very sick NNS . Since DT beginning of his career , Bieber has been caught up in a never - ending whirlwind of strange , humiliating events and has often displayed bizarre behavior . He ’s always been a “ whipping boy ” of DT industry and DT face of crappy pop music . With Yummy , DT pattern continues . His handlers purposely turned Yummy into some kind of “ child - lover ” anthem by associating PRP with overt imagery and creepy Instagram posts . In short , Bieber was used to push CD of DT elite ’s favorite agendas : DT normalization and DT celebration of child abuse . P.S.

NNP YORK ( CNN ) -- PRP all VBP to live in a NN WDT 's clean , healthy and prosperous . PRP all VBP to hand DT NN off to our NNS in slightly better shape than PRP received PRP . No NN , even DT supposedly evil oil executive , has any reason to VB anything different . But , for some reason , PRP find ourselves searching for villains . Surely PRP exist , but DT endless quest to create them sometimes overwhelms our better judgment , whether intentional or not . Congress has picked "" Big Oil "" as their enemy of DT week . These companies inexplicably put profits above NNS , ravaging DT environment and financially assaulting DT poor to put another couple of dollars on their balance sheet . DT 's DT storyline PRP 've all been taught . Yes , times are tough for JJ . Sure , oil companies make a lot of cash . But , for DT money , PRP VBP PRP to work , VB ambulances to DT hospital , keep our homes warm , and employ thousands of our friends and neighbors while financing their retirement , paying their NN care , and providing NN to millions . Because of capitalism , PRP have DT incentive to do DT . I 've yet to see what our NN does for PRP with their rather large chunk of each gallon of gas PRP buy , and I 've yet to see them offer to return PRP or suggest a gas - tax - windfall - tax - tax . DT other villain of DT moment is DT JJ NN "" denier . "" Anyone who disagrees , even in DT slightest , must be ridiculed . On "" 60 Minutes "" last weekend , Al Gore VBD : "" PRP 're almost IN DT ones who still believe IN DT moon landing was staged in a movie lot in Arizona and those who believe DT NNP is flat . DT demeans them a little bit , but PRP 's not RB far off . "" Approximately 6 percent of Americans believe in DT fake moon landing theory , although I 've always heard EX was a conspiratorial consensus IN PRP was staged in Nevada , not Arizona . I 'm VBG to guess quite a bit less than 6 percent believe in a flat NNP , but no NN seems to be asking DT question in polls anymore , so I can't be sure . So , who are those NNS Gore was demeaning "" a little bit "" by these comparisons ? EX 's a good chance PRP 's PRP . DT 's because DT vast majority of Americans believe something WDT categorizes them as a flat earther to environmentalists IN Gore . Despite DT NN 's CD - sided view ( DT Business and NNP Institute says dissenting voices about JJ NN are outnumbered on CBS NNP broadcasts by a 38 to 1 ratio ) , only 21 percent of Americans say "" DT release of greenhouse gasses is DT most important factor causing JJ NN "" according to a 2007 NNP York Times / CBS NNP poll . DT "" 60 Minutes "" piece was n't just filled with misrepresentations of opinion ; PRP had plenty of Gore - style hypocrisy . He was embroiled in controversy when PRP was revealed his mansion used 20 times more NN than DT average American . His explanation ? "" Since then "" his house has been retrofitted with solar panels . I 'm sure Eliot Spitzer has n't been renting JJ women since he was caught either . ( Although I 'm not betting my life on PRP . ) PRP then see footage of Gore 's parents ' farm WDT will , sometime in DT future , be run on wind power . Apparently , DT windmill store has been out of stock for DT past 20 NNS . Perhaps most comically , Gore is seen dragging an entire film crew on a jet to India to give a NN presentation to about 100 NNS . Gore claimed : "" PRP just do n't have any choice . I wish I knew a better way to do PRP . I constantly ask myself , ' How can I be more effective in getting this message across ? ' "" DT most effective thing PRP can VB of is flying halfway across DT NN to speak with 100 NNS ? Maybe PRP had other things to do while PRP were RB , but I 'd be surprised if EX was anything essential WDT MD n't be accomplished with a telephone and a computer . DT NNS in India will be able to see your fancy graphs on their screens , and PRP 'll cut demand for those evil overseas flights . DT entire "" 60 Minutes "" piece felt IN a commercial for Gore 's upcoming commercials . He 's spending $ 300 million in advertising to convince NNS of something he claims EX is already a consensus on . To put DT much money into perspective ; PRP 's more than Sen. Barack Obama , Sen. Hillary NNP , Sen. John Edwards , Sen. John McCain , former Gov. Mike Huckabee and Rep. Ron Paul raised in all of last NN combined . VB of PRP as VBG green by getting lots of green . Where is all DT money coming from ? Gore says he 's donating his profits from "" An Inconvenient Truth , "" and his Nobel Peace Prize cash award . Let 's be generous and say EX 's only $ 290 million left to explain . Apparently , a follow - up question to find DT origins of this nine - figure sum MD have involved six seconds WDT "" 60 Minutes "" was n't willing to commit . What is EX to learn from all of this ? Whether PRP 's politicians on both sides of DT aisle or our vaunted environmental superheroes , DT quest for power overwhelms even DT slightest instinct of self - examination . In DT end , DT timing of DT Gore interview airing MD n't have been better . PRP fell on DT same weekend as DT first "" NNP Hour , "" when DT NN supposedly came together to turn our attention to NN NN by shutting DT lights off for an hour . DT imagery of monuments IN DT Sears Tower in Chicago , Illinois , VBG dark was plastered over newscasts everywhere . But those pictures highlighted DT JJ NN movement and DT congressional attacks on NN companies in an entirely unintended way . Behind DT darkened Sears Tower was DT city of Chicago , with lights shining brightly as far as DT eye MD see . For CD hour DT Sears Tower knew what PRP was IN to be Al Gore : A larger than life symbol , blocking our view of reality . DT opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of DT writer ."

Canada passed bird - friendly lighting ( and construction ) laws in DT mid-1990s , and now numerous cities — including Toronto , Washington , D.C. , and NNP York — participate in lights - out campaigns during peak migration seasons . And in 2016 , DT American NNP Association responded to DT growing body of evidence suggesting IN intense LEDs are harmful to human NN by recommending IN communities VBP streetlights to “ minimize and control blue - rich environmental lighting . ” Entire cities are even re-doing their lights in an attempt to reclaim DT night and decrease NN waste . Flagstaff , Arizona , was DT first city to be designated a Dark Sky Community by DT International Dark - Sky Association , and Chicago is in DT process of retrofitting its fixtures . So far , hesitations about dimmer , sparser lighting causing an uptick in crime or decreased safety at night have not been supported by DT data ; in Chicago ’s West Garfield Park , more brightly lit alleys actually led to an increase in reported crime . And anecdotally , NNS are finding IN less glaring lighting makes PRP easier to see in unlit areas , because our eyes adapt more quickly to DT dark . For some cities , eliminating light pollution is RB a way to increase tourism revenue while strengthening humanity ’s connection to DT night sky . Consider DT town of Jasper , Alberta . Nestled in DT remote Canadian Rockies , Jasper is a haven for those who love DT mountains , wildlife , and DT outdoors . Just a few minutes drive outside town , stargazers can see a dazzling array of nighttime wonders , from oft - hidden stars and satellites to meteorites and DT aurora borealis . Since 2010 , DT city has hosted a Dark Sky Festival in DT fall WDT brings in thousands of NNS . But Jasper residents are n’t content to have DT nighttime wonders visible only just beyond their borders . DT town is now working with Lumican , a Canadian company WDT partners with DT International Dark - Sky Association , to re-do all its streetlights . Slated to start this summer , DT town ’s roughly 400 fixtures will be replaced with shielded Lumican LEDs set to color temperatures ranging between 1,700 and 2,200 Kelvin , which efficiently cast an amber glow while limiting more harmful blue wavelengths . “ What caught our attention at first was how horrible all these JJ LED street lights looked ; so glary , prison - UH , and overly bright , ” says Lumican ’s Lara Mitchell . When she realized IN such street lighting erases stars and damages ecosystems , DT company turned toward fighting light pollution . Throughout North America and Europe , dark sky parks are on DT rise , and festivals IN Jasper ’s are flourishing . NNS are beginning to reconnect with DT sparkling canvas WDT swirls overhead just as technologies are becoming available on scales WDT will help humanity reclaim more of this natural nighttime majesty — if PRP choose to use them . Christopher Kyba , DT scientist who studies light pollution on a JJ level , points to van Gogh ’s “ Cafe Terrace at Night ” as his image of an ideal nighttime scene . “ This is DT dream of what PRP VBP to have — nice , warm , uniform lighting . PRP can see lots of stars up above , DT facades are unlit , ” he says . “ PRP look a hundred - something NNS in DT past to see DT idealized lighting . ”"

PRP write thousands of words to each other proving IN every obscure clue adds up to a big picture WDT only PRP can see . Just a few clicks away , other Reddit users are sure IN a secretive group — DT Illuminati — is part of a sprawling and hidden NN to control DT real NN . PRP do exactly DT same thing . EX are some clear parallels between fan NN theories and political NN theories . PRP were once confined to DT far corners of American culture , but in recent NNS have flourished thanks in part to internet message boards and social NN , which offer anyone DT opportunity to publish , debunk , rebunk and remix their own imaginary concepts and share them with RB - minded theorists . DT theories , however , share more than just message boards . DT psychology of groups and DT internet ’s propensity to amplify outlandish content and reward DT NNS who create PRP has created DT kind of feedback loops in which bizarre theories — from both fantasy fans and DT politically paranoid — flourish . Russell Zimmerman , 41 , a writer , game developer and military historian , loves to theorize about “ Game of Thrones , ” particularly DT books on which PRP is based , George R.R. Martin ’s series , “ A Song of NNP and Fire . ” But some theories are even too much for him , such as CD WDT argues CD character ( Varys , DT spymaster ) is secretly a NN creature . “ To me , DT 's about DT level of ‘ out RB ’ crazy - talk as assuming EX 's a kiddie porn ring in DT basement of a pizza shop without a basement , ” he VBD , referring to DT “ pizzagate ” NN theory WDT remains popular on DT fringes of DT far right . “ Thrones ” is not DT only show with a strong internet following and crackpot theories . DT popular Adult Swim show “ Rick and Morty ” has various fan guesses at DT show ’s secrets . BBC ’s “ Doctor Who , ” which follows a NN - traveling human - looking alien exploring DT universe , has its own theories . And in DT early days of DT consumer internet , “ DT X - Files , ” a show WDT often touched on real - life NN theories , gave birth to some of DT first online fan theories . Meanwhile , any number of real - NN NN theories have taken hold among various political and social groups on DT internet . Joseph Uscinski , associate professor of political NN at DT University of Miami and author of “ NNP Theories and DT NNPS Who Believe Them , ” VBD diehard fans and NN theorists share a love of extrapolating from DT facts in their possession . “ NN theories are similar to fan fiction in IN PRP both allow NNS to make up whatever PRP VBP , ” he VBD . Uscinski VBD IN whether PRP ’s “ Game of Thrones , ” “ Star Wars ” or DT JFK assassination , NNS can take a plot or an event and “ VB to wherever PRP VBP with PRP . ” As an example , Uscinski cited Qanon , a remarkably popular genre of NN theories WDT generally center on a mysterious figure who claims IN NNP Donald NNP is working to uncover a powerful group of pedophiles . “ PRP have this anonymous poster , Q , who puts out nonsensical clues and NNS try to make sense of PRP and try to figure out what happens next , ” he VBD . “ PRP are enjoying this . PRP VBP piecing these things together . PRP ’s a fan thing for them . ” Brendon Boutin , 32 , who runs a popular “ Game of Thrones ” recap channel , “ Man of Recaps , ” VBD DT excitement generated by both kinds of theories drove their popularity . “ I VBP DT biggest similarity is DT feeling PRP VBP , DT rush of hunting for DT truth and discovering secret knowledge , ” Boutin VBD by email . “ I watched some 9/11 ‘ Truth ’ videos back in DT day , and those brought about DT same thrill as discovering Jon Snow 's parentage . ” “ Game of Thrones ” is far from DT only show to have a fervent fanbase WDT has created its own theories , but few have created a community as rich and active , both online and off . Laurel Steinberg , a NNP York - based relationship therapist , VBD DT behavior shown by NN theorists and superfans is “ absolutely analogous . ” “ NNS VBP to feel part of a group , part of a movement , part of a team , ” Steinberg VBD . “ PRP feels good to have something WDT gives them a identity . PRP feels good to have something to be excited about , and watch develop in real NN . ” But “ Thrones ” fandom is RB susceptible to DT same internet dynamics WDT have spurred ever - more outlandish NN theories , rewarding NNS who can draw DT most attention . “ PRP 're able to create community , and then become an expert . PRP ’ve ridden DT tailcoats of DT star and then PRP become a breakout star in DT community , ” Steinberg VBD . ” PRP become an influencer . ” Chloe Ketchum , 27 , who co-hosts a podcast about DT series , “ Girls Gone Canon , ” VBD IN while she enjoys DT feeling of community around “ Game of Thrones , ” she ’s RB seen DT lengths some fans will VB to attract a following . “ EX are creators WDT push shock value to VB views , ” Ketchum VBD . “ NNS will do anything for attention . ” While EX are similarities in DT psychology behind intense fandoms and political conspiracists , Uscinski stressed IN PRP result in divergent behaviors . He VBD fans will generally abandon theories WDT do n’t hold up , whereas NN theorists ignore evidence WDT proves them wrong . EX ’s RB DT real - NN consequences . NN theories around politics and current events have inspired some NNS to commit acts of violence , which has led to efforts by politicians and activist groups to force internet platforms to reign in DT spread of DT disinformation WDT can fuel DT theories . “ When DT show comes out , NNS will disregard their theories WDT did n’t turn out to be true , ” he VBD . “ But with flat earthers , when PRP do an experiment and PRP does n’t show them what PRP VBP , PRP still hold DT belief anyway . PRP ’re much more invested ”"

NNP supporters had long dismissed concerns about her NN as baseless , insisting IN she only suffered from allergies . But Sunday ’s incident — along with a video appearing to show NNP having difficulty standing on her own — will only amplify such questions just as DT race enters its final weeks . DT incident RB MD increase pressure on NNP , 68 , and Republican nominee Donald NNP , 70 , to release more information about their NN . NNP has disclosed less than some previous candidates . Donald NNP has released almost nothing . “ This is DT kind of thing WDT voters have a right to understand before PRP cast a vote , ” VBD Katie Packer , a GOP strategist who says she does not support either NNP or NNP . “ Both NNP and Hillary are elderly . PRP are obligated to release full JJ records and full tax returns to DT American NNS . And DT NN , party leaders and American NNS should settle for nothing less . ” DT pneumonia diagnosis comes as DT campaign enters its most grueling phase , weeks before DT first presidential debate and as voters start heading to DT polls in NNS with early voting . Her doctor , who made DT diagnosis Friday , has advised NNP to curtail her schedule . But DT Democratic candidate did not appear to skip any planned events over DT weekend , including a fundraiser in NNP York headlined by Barbra Streisand . After DT incident , NNP ’s campaign VBD late Sunday PRP was canceling a planned trip to California on Monday and Tuesday for fundraisers and a taping of “ DT Ellen DeGeneres Show . ” NNP ’s lung infection comes after a tough week for her campaign , with polls showing a tightening of DT race against NNP . Then over DT weekend , NNP was forced to partially walk back comments she made referring to half of NNP ’s supporters as “ deplorables . ” DT JJ scrutiny of her NN will add to these problems . “ Forty - eight hours ago , this was something for DT Flat NNP Society and DT birth certificate deniers , ” Dan Schnur , director of USC ’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics , VBD of DT speculation about NNP ’s NN . “ Now PRP ’s a topic of legitimate , mainstream political discussion . ” Although NNP ’s opponents will surely make an issue of her having pneumonia , her campaign ’s relatively quick release of DT diagnosis marked a significant step toward transparency for a candidate who has often shied away from disclosing information she considers private . But some critics complained IN NNP did not reveal DT potentially debilitating condition Friday when PRP was diagnosed . And after she fell ill Sunday morning , her campaign initially attributed PRP to “ overheating ” and waited nearly seven hours — as rumors and speculation about her NN swirled — until disclosing DT pneumonia . For NNP , perhaps DT most damaging part of DT day was DT CD - second video of her struggling to leave DT event in NNP York City . DT video , quickly circulated online and replayed on cable NN channels , shows her standing uneasily , her knees appearing to buckle and needing help to VB into her van . A spokesman VBD immediately afterward IN NNP left DT ceremony at DT site of DT NNP Trade Center about 9:30 a.m. because she felt unwell . Reporters who were traveling with NNP were not told about her condition or her whereabouts for 90 minutes after she left DT ceremony . “ Secretary NNP attended DT Sept. 11th commemoration ceremony for just an hour and 30 minutes this morning to pay her respects and greet some of DT families of DT fallen , ” spokesman Nick Merrill VBD in DT initial statement released by DT campaign . “ During DT ceremony , she felt overheated so departed to VB to her daughter ’s apartment , and is feeling much better . ” DT weather was in DT low 80s and humid . NNP spent about two hours at Chelsea NNP ’s apartment and emerged shortly before noon wearing sunglasses , greeting a young girl and waved at diners at a nearby restaurant . “ I ’m feeling great . PRP ’s a beautiful day in NNP York , ” NNP VBD before heading to her home in Chappaqua , N.Y . Her personal physician examined her at her house Sunday afternoon and VBD NNP was recovering . “ While at this morning ’s event , she became overheated and dehydrated . I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely , ” VBD Dr. Lisa R. Bardack in a statement . Bardack VBD NNP was put on antibiotics Friday . NNP ’s NN has long been DT speculation of NN theorists . In 2014 , a NNP magazine cover of NNP in her backyard leaning on a chair prompted speculation IN she was leaning on a walker . But innuendo about her NN grew markedly during DT presidential campaign as NNP and his surrogates , including former NNP York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani , routinely questioned her strength and stamina on DT campaign trail . NNP was uncharacteristically silent Sunday after NN of NNP ’s illness emerged . Republicans have RB pointed to coughing fits IN NNP has suffered while campaigning , and which she attributes to seasonal allergies . Her opponents have RB raised questions about DT effect of a concussion she sustained in 2012 . DT drumbeat got to DT point IN NNP poked fun at PRP on late - night television . During an August appearance on “ Jimmy Kimmel Live , ” she pretended to exert great effort as she opened a jar of pickles and asked DT host to check her pulse . NNP dismissed DT attacks as “ wacky ” and noted IN critics have claimed “ I MD be dead in six months , ” she VBD . “ So with every breath I take I feel IN I have a JJ lease on life . ” For DT latest on national and California politics , follow @LATSeema on Twitter .

JJ ancient cultures subscribed to DT idea but PRP was made famous again in modern times thanks to DT creation of a Flat NNP society by Samuel Shenton in 1956 . Mark Sargent , an avid member of DT club and author of several books on DT topic , revealed CD reason why he believes PRP is more than just a NN . Speaking during Netflix documentary “ Behind DT Curve ” , Mr Sargant claimed his theory was superior to everything NASA has told PRP for NNS . Taking DT production crew to a beach near his home , Mr Sargant pointed at DT city of Seattle across DT NN . He VBD in 2018 : “ Here ’s an example if PRP VBP to see PRP real quick . “ So UH DT buildings in DT distance – right out RB – DT is Seattle . “ PRP should not be able to see PRP . “ EX should be hundreds of feet of curvature between PRP and them . ” Mr Sargant went on to dismiss any scientific reasoning for DT revelation , before claiming DT Flat NNP theory answers all DT questions . He added : “ PRP can say PRP ’s refraction , or PRP ’s atmospheric effects , no – not in every weather condition , not in every light condition . “ This is why NN is having a problem combating what PRP are doing . “ Neil deGrasse Tyson says PRP ’s a growing anti-intellectual movement which borders on DT end of civilisation as PRP VBP PRP . “ But DT reason why PRP ’re winning versus NN , is NN just throws back maths . Neil deGrasse Tyson is an American astrophysicist author and leading NN figure . He has been a long NN supporter of NASA , claiming DT space agency deserves more funding and backing by DT general NN . In March 2012 , he testified before DT NNP NNPS Senate NNP Committee , stating : "" Right now , NASA 's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar . "" For twice DT – a penny on a dollar – PRP can transform DT country from a sullen , dispirited nation , weary of JJ struggle , to CD where PRP has reclaimed its 20th - century birthright to dream of tomorrow . "" Mr Tyson RB runs his own YouTube channel – StarTalk – where he has previously called out Flat Earthers . He VBD in March 2018 : “ PRP have videos from space of DT rotating spherical NNP – DT NNP is round ."

Mick Jagger MD excite DT NN in CD note , while Thomas Friedman needs 461 pages to say , “ Shit happens . ” Joan of Arc and Charles Manson had more in common . Thomas Friedman was once a man of great influence . His columns were must - reads for every senator and congressperson . He helped spread DT globalization gospel and push PRP into war in Iraq . But he ’s destined now to be more famous as a literary figure . No modern writer has been lampooned more . Hundreds if not thousands of man-hours have been spent teaching robots to produce automated Friedman - prose , in what collectively is a half - vicious , half - loving tribute to a man who raised bad writing to DT level of an art form . PRP will remember Friedman for interviewing 76 percent of DT NN ’s taxi drivers , for predicting “ DT next six months will be critical ” on 14 occasions over two and a half NNS ( birthing DT neologism , “ DT Friedman unit “ ) , and for his unmatched , God - given ability to write nonsensical metaphors , IN his classic “ rule of holes ” : “ When PRP ’re in CD , stop digging . When PRP ’re in three , bring a lot of shovels . ” Friedman ’s great anti-gift is his ability to use JJ words when only a few are necessary . He became famous as a newspaper columnist for taking simple CD - sentence observations IN , “ Wow , everyone has a cell phone these days , ” and blowing them out into furious 850 - word trash - fires of mismatched imagery and circular argument . DT double - axel version of this feat was to then rewrite DT same column over and over again , in DT same newspaper , only piling on more incongruous imagery and skewing rhetoric to further stoke DT CD thought into an even higher and angrier fire . For nearly two decades now , Friedman has been telling PRP IN something big is happening , technology is growing at a rate beyond DT ability of humans to adapt ( this is where DT part about noticing everyone has a cell phone comes in ) , and IN PRP have to stop doing things DT old way and take a brave step into DT future . He wrote this column so JJ times IN even four NNS ago – eight Friedman units – Hamilton Nolan wrote a piece in Gawker titled “ Thomas Friedman writes his only column again ” ( Friedman ’s “ only column ” has by now outlived hundreds of NN outlets , Gawker and my own NNP York Press among them ) . Nolan cited a piece in DT Times called “ DT Rise of Popularism , ” in which Friedman argued , again , IN technology was racing past humanity ’s ability to govern itself wisely . A very conservative guess is IN Friedman has written this column at least a hundred times . Maybe 200 . Maybe more . If PRP ’re rolling your eyes at this , check yourself . VB about what an awesome accomplishment WDT is . PRP takes an extraordinary discipline to turn CD sentence of thought into hundreds of thousands of words . PRP all repeat ourselves in DT punditry business . Most of PRP only have a few ideas . Friedman has fewer than most – PRP ’s really just CD , technology future derp ! – but he ’s attacked IN CD idea with such relentless evangelical NN WDT he is leaving behind as a monument to PRP DT literary equivalent of DT Giza pyramid complex . This decades - long gigantic art project is based upon a vast architecture of needless complication , a process he describes in this JJ book of his , Thank PRP for Being Late , as “ translating English into English . ” Build a sentence into a column ; build a column into JJ columns ; build JJ columns into a book ; build CD book into JJ books . Then start over ! Eleven NNS ago , when Friedman wrote his seminal explainer book , DT NNP is Flat – a book whose title metaphor was hilariously based on DT wrong premise IN NNS are more interconnected on a flat NN than on a round CD – he combined two giant sets of metaphors to describe DT same idea IN technology was outpacing our ability to govern ourselves . He VBD rapid changes in DT NN were being fueled by 10 “ flatteners ” ( things IN DT end of communism , Netscape , outsourcing , etc. ) which in turn were amplified by he VBD were four “ steroids ” : Digital , Mobile , Personal and Virtual . Those four steroids actually turned out to be six – changing or extending DT terms of his imagery midstream is a classic Friedmanism – and DT sixth “ steroid , ” JJ wireless devices , was actually a JJ group of steroids he called “ uber-steroids . ” This was confusing because DT tenth item in Friedman ’s list of “ flatteners ” was DT group of four steroids . So his last flattener was a JJ group of steroids and his last steroid was a JJ group of uber - steroids . Which meant PRP had uber - steroids amplifying steroids amplifying flatteners , with each list comprising items WDT belonged to other lists . He mashed all of DT together for 470 pages or so . Eleven NNS and countless columns later , DT JJ book Thank PRP for Being Late takes DT same structure and boldly complicates PRP . This book is built , again , around DT idea IN technological NN is advancing beyond our ability to adapt . DT culprits this NN are three great “ Accelerations ” : Moore ’s Law ( microchip processing power doubles every 18 to 24 months ) , DT market ( globalization ) and Mother Nature , which is his English - language term for DT English - language term , “ NN NN and biodiversity loss . ” These Three Accelerations in turn are transforming five key “ realms , ” which he lists as “ DT workplace , politics , geopolitics , ethics , and DT community . ” If PRP ’re wondering what ’s left over when PRP subtract , from DT subset of all things , “ DT workplace , politics , geopolitics , ethics , and DT community , ” PRP ’re on to something . Because PRP turns out IN DT book is about how something is happening to – everything ! “ In short , ” Friedman says , in DT opening chapter of Late , “ this book is CD giant column about DT NN today . ” Incidentally , whenever Friedman uses DT phrase , “ In short … ” he ’s about to take DT short form of an idea and make PRP longer , e.g . “ In short , DT only way for Mexico to thrive is with a strategy of reform retail WDT will enable PRP to beat NNP to DT top , not DT bottom , because NNP is not focused on beating Mexico as much as PRP is on beating America . ” To his credit , in Thank PRP for Being Late , Friedman debuts DT use of , “ To make a short story long , ” which is n’t exactly fixing DT problem . But PRP is funnier . So how giant is this JJ giant column ? Really giant . EX are n’t enough drugs in DT NN to VB anyone through Thank PRP for Being Late in CD sitting . Take DT chapter about Mother Nature , which opens with a story about a day in July , 2015 when DT heat index in southern Iran reached 163 degrees . DT NN item gives DT author an opening to introduce DT concept of a “ black elephant , ” an ominous ( if PRP VBP Friedman ) term apparently explained to him by environmentalist Adam Sweidan : “ [ PRP is ] a cross between a ‘ black swan ’ – a rare , low - probability , unanticipated event with enormous ramifications – and ‘ DT elephant in DT room ’ : a problem WDT is widely visible to everyone , yet IN no NN wants to address , even though PRP absolutely VBP IN CD day PRP will have vast , black - swan - JJ consequences . ” PRP MD VB he MD just say , “ DT NN NN problem is a cross between a black swan and DT elephant in DT room – or , as I VBP to call PRP , a Black Elephant . ” Instead he leads audiences through drawn - out explanations of two everyday terms . Moreover his unnecessary definition of “ DT elephant in DT room ” contains DT phrase “ black swan , ” making what was originally a relatively simple idea now a kind of circular movie - within - a - movie image WDT is more than a little hard to follow : “ A black elephant is a cross between a black swan event and DT elephant in DT room , which is an ignored but visibly obvious problem WDT will inevitably become a black swan event . ” PRP ’re still grappling with DT when PRP learn “ EX are a herd of environmental black elephants out RB . ” Friedman names at least four : JJ NN , deforestation , ocean acidification and mass biodiversity extinction . He quotes Sweidan as saying of these : “ When PRP hit , PRP ’ll claim PRP were black swans WDT no NN MD have predicted , but in fact PRP were black elephants , very visible right now . ” Friedman just got finished telling PRP IN a black elephant is half black swan , and half elephant in DT room WDT will inevitably become a black swan . But now IN half - swan , half swan - within - an - elephant is being contrasted with a black swan : in DT near future , things WDT are really black elephants will be misidentified as black swans . So DT ’s weird . While PRP ’re sorting DT out , Friedman tells PRP IN DT PRP IN a 163 - degree heat index in Iran is another black elephant , because “ PRP can see PRP sitting in a room , PRP can feel PRP , and PRP can read about PRP in DT newspaper . ” He adds : “ IN any black elephant , PRP RB VBP IN PRP is so far outside DT norm IN PRP has all DT characteristics of a black swan – IN PRP is DT harbinger of some very big , unpredictable changes in our NN system PRP MD be unable to control . ” DT next thing he says is IN PRP spend tons of money preparing for DT relatively unlikely event of nuclear war , but virtually nothing to prevent a very likely NN NN catastrophe . He MD have just led DT chapter with DT . But DT MD defeat DT purpose of translating English into English . PRP ’re still wondering what happened to DT elephant reading a newspaper about a black swan roasting in DT desert when Friedman moves on to DT next space - devouring exercise , telling PRP about DT four phrases PRP need to master to learn “ NN - speak . ” All four sound IN DT same idea and are immediately forgettable : “ Just a few NNS ago … but then something changed . ” “ Wow , I ’ve never seen DT before . ” “ Well , usually , but now I do n’t VB anymore . ” “ PRP have n’t seen anything IN DT since . ” Quick , name any of those phrases PRP just read . PRP can ’t ! But PRP “ have to master ” all of them to grasp DT rapidity of NN disturbances , which Friedman now describes as Mother Nature moving into DT “ second half of DT chessboard . ” This is a reference to a metaphor from an earlier chapter recalling DT ancient tale of DT mathematician who asked a king for a reward . DT master asked to have CD grain of rice put on CD corner of a chessboard , and then to have twice as JJ put on DT next square , and to keep VBG , on and on to DT end . DT punchline is IN after doubling down 64 times , PRP end up with 18 quintillion grains of rice or something – more than PRP ’d have guessed ! Which is a metaphor for how much faster than PRP VBP is DT pace of NN all around PRP , be PRP in technology , JJ displacement or , in this case , DT environment . Did PRP VB IN “ megatoothed sharks prowled DT oceans ” DT last NN DT CO2 concentration in DT NN ’s atmosphere was as high as PRP was in Hawaii on NNP 3rd , 2013 , an astonishing four hundred parts per million ? PRP probably did n’t , because things WDT prowl usually have feet – but anyway , back to DT elephants : “ And sometimes DT records being broken as Mother Nature enters DT second half of DT chessboard are so numerous and profound , NN agencies tracking them seem to run out of even NN - speak to describe DT black elephants PRP are seeing . ” This must be DT talent for “ boiling things down ” WDT Mr. Micklethwait talked about ! God bless this man . MD he never stop writing books . Let ’s grow this pie as big as PRP can . P.S. winners of DT extraordinary # friedmangraphs contest to be announced soon .

DT VBN , DT topic is certainly a fresh NN for Twitter beef . NNS have recognized DT curvature of DT NNP for more than 2,000 NNS . But rapper B.o.B. challenged DT view on Sunday when he began tweeting images and diagrams WDT he VBD were proof DT NNP is as flat as a 45 . Did PRP mention B.o.B. is promoting a JJ album ? Well he is . But he insists those things are definitely not related . So far , B.o.B. -- nee Bobby Ray Simmons -- has posted almost 50 images of DT supposedly flat NN , along with quotes from DT 2014 book “ DT Flat NNP NNP ” by Eric Dubay . Thousands of fans retweeted B.o.B. ’s claims IN “ I ’m VBG up against DT greatest liars in history ... PRP ’ve been tremendously deceived ” and “ I question DT international laws WDT prevent PRP from exploring Antartica and DT North Pole ... what ’s EX to hide ? ” Usually , when a prominent scientist steps forward to set DT record straight , DT ’s DT end of DT conversation . But not for B.o.B . He tweeted a song he ’d written , “ Flatline , ” in which he insists “ Neil Tyson need to loosen up his vest ” and ponders why NASA is part of DT Department of Defense . ( Actually , PRP ’s not . ) Then , in a move B.o.B. probably did n’t see coming , Tyson dropped a diss track back at him . DT rapper Tyson was referring to was his nephew , Steve Tyson , who goes by “ Tyson . ” He wrote and recorded DT song “ Flat to Fact . ” In an interview with DT Times , Tyson DT rapper VBD he came up with DT idea of writing a song in his famous uncle ’s defense after texting with him Tuesday morning “ I recorded PRP in my living room , ” Tyson VBD . “ I wrote PRP in a couple hours and just hit record and started recording PRP as a track . ” His uncle recorded himself reading some of his tweets to use in DT song . Not everyone was persuaded . JJ followers s eemed eager to jump on DT flat NNP bandwagon B.o.B. was all too eager to retweet them . Perhaps Laura Danly will be more convincing . DT curator of DT Griffith Observatory , kindly agreed to address a few of B.o.B. including why PRP ca n’t see DT curvature of DT NNP . “ DT NNP is just big , ” she VBD . “ PRP look out to DT horizon and PRP looks flat . But if PRP VBP into space PRP can see DT curvature . ” B.o.B. asserts IN PRP have no photos of a curved NNP WDT were n’t “ taken ” by NASA . DT ’s not true either : DT NNP , including NNP in 2014 and Japan just last NN . Other things WDT prove DT NNP is round : DT fact IN PRP can observe sunrises and sunsets . DT fact IN NNS in different hemispheres see different constellations . DT fact IN PRP can fly around PRP in a straight line . So for DT record , DT NNP : definitely round .

Over DT course of DT early modern period , DT ‘ space ’ of DT Netherlands opened up in several productive ways . Perhaps most famously , DT Dutch created DT JJ space of DT Republic : viable political space , demarcated from an older collection of provinces , which had been gathered most recently under DT auspices of DT king of Spain . DT Dutch RB expended tremendous effort reconstituting DT physical space of DT Low NNPS : land reclaimed from NN and increased urban centres , which allowed DT Republic to grow in population and gain in arable terrain . And DT Dutch enlarged their commercial and colonial space by dint of their numerous overseas expansions : a ‘ NNP ’ Netherland ( almost always referred to in singular form ) , which arose on DT eastern shores of what was already then called North America ; a modern ‘ Batavia ’ , which emerged in present‐day Indonesia ; and a host of Dutch forts and settlements WDT otherwise dotted DT coasts and islands of Asia , Africa and DT Americas . DT Dutch RB developed , just as famously , JJ pictorial devices to engage with space – DT painterly and printerly techniques explored in this issue – and , not unrelated , JJ techniques to map spaces : DT most robust cartographic ateliers of early modern Europe , which developed first in Antwerp and then in Amsterdam from DT late sixteenth century , coincident with DT rise of DT Dutch Republic and DT Golden Age of Dutch visual culture . Maps proliferated in DT early modern Netherlands . PRP offered a means both to delineate space and to narrate space – to explicate how space works and to assert where their makers ( and consumers ) fit within these spaces . Yet maps were RB important and ubiquitous material objects in DT Netherlands , which occupied myriad additional spaces and which played with DT JJ spatial and material concerns of their viewers . PRP engaged viewers and enticed them into their interpretive spaces . How do Dutch maps work , and what does this reveal about DT visual culture of DT early modern Netherlands ? These questions were famously tackled by Svetlana Alpers in DT Art of Describing mostly in regard to landscape painting . Yet in JJ ways , her influential essay on ‘ DT Mapping Impulse in Dutch Art ’ – DT NN ‐to source for non ‐Dutch specialists , particularly historians of NN who seek to affiliate their concerns with habits of natural ‐history representation with a broadly northern European tradition of painting – curiously avoided DT key to this intriguing interpretive palace : DT maps themselves and how PRP actually function . 1 While Alpers ’ oft‐cited chapter does open with Vermeer 's Allegory of Painting and DT impressive wall map by Claes Jansz . Visscher WDT amply fills its background , maps are otherwise relegated to DT side , treated sparingly and elliptically at best – at least DT form of artfully designed , lavishly embellished and meticulously printed maps WDT enjoyed such phenomenal popularity in DT Netherlands from DT late sixteenth through at least DT early eighteenth century . Maps do matter , and , as Alpers astutely points out , cartographic materials played a significant and instructive role in DT visual , social and indeed DT political culture of DT early modern Dutch Republic . PRP were ubiquitous in more ways than CD : as décor in houses and paintings ; as devices of learning and social standing ; as NN of cultural and political messaging . In a vital sense , however , these roles remain conspicuously absent in her analysis , inadequately problematized and not at all ‘ deconstructed ’ – to invoke DT language of DT JJ critical cartography WDT was being developed precisely when Alpers was formulating her insights into Dutch visual culture . 2 Maps as productive sources ( as opposed to theorized ‘ impulses ’ ) are only lightly glossed in Alpers ’ essay , their most superficial features brought to bear on a , by contrast , highly sophisticated argument about forms of ‘ mapped ’ landscapes ( as she terms PRP ) , best exemplified by DT flat panoramic paintings of Philips Koninck . This inverted theoretical focus distorts our perspective of Dutch ( and other ) maps and relegates to DT periphery an enormously dynamic visual source in DT early modern Netherlands . PRP RB irons out – unnecessarily – DT stimulating complexities of cartographic sources and DT promising possibilities of Alpers ’ implied query : what do maps offer to scholars of Dutch visual culture ? Rather than a ‘ flat working surface ’ , a Dutch map of this period was typically dense and jagged , presenting DT viewer with multiple angles of interpretive entry , as DT essays of this issue show for other NN and genres . Rather than offering a ‘ detached or perhaps even … culturally unbiased view ’ – can such a source ever be possible ? – these profusely layered artefacts furnish critical insight into and material evidence of DT visual culture WDT Alpers aims to address . 3 Early modern maps are delightfully thick objects and fundamentally material things . PRP illustrate modes of representation and craft , and PRP encourage various points of vision and interpretation . As PRP turns out , maps are anything but ‘ flat ’ . PRP richly demonstrate , in their own way , DT ‘ picturing impulse ’ of early modern Dutch culture . This brief intervention aims not so much to argue with Alpers as to consider a part of her argument WDT was left relatively under‐scrutinized : DT workings of Dutch maps . My goal is less to analyse how these maps work – EX is a vast and expanding literature WDT does just that4 – or even how PRP work in DT context of early modern Dutch painting , but rather to explore DT qualities of cartographic design WDT might speak to DT thematics of seeing and sensing pictures , so IN PRP might contribute , in this way , to DT broader understanding of Dutch visual culture WDT this issue sets out to explore . Maps are indubitably thick : PRP gesture relentlessly toward their materiality and to DT challenge their makers face in rendering into two dimensions what begins as three – DT same challenge confronted by Dutch painters , as several of DT essays gathered here so elegantly argue . Maps are theatrical : PRP stage JJ space in a profusely embellished form – PRP rarely offer mere , austere ‘ description ’ – and PRP dramatize for their viewers ways of processing both DT lands and waters of DT NN and DT things and events WDT occur within them . And – as this might imply – maps are narrational : PRP narrate spaces , frame histories and posit polemics – much IN Baroque theatre , to be sure , yet RB IN genres of painting of DT period , both in DT Netherlands and elsewhere . To demonstrate a few of these qualities , I turn , naturally , to a map : Nicolaes Visscher 's immensely popular Novissima et Accuratissima Totius Americae Descriptio ( first edition c . 1658 ; plate 1 ) , published more or less contemporaneously with Vermeer 's Allegory of Painting ( c . 1666–68 ) . Visscher 's printed map has an impressive history , VBG backward and forward , and touching as well DT key cartographic source of Alpers ’ inquiry . 5 Its original author was DT only son of Claes Jansz . Visscher , DT well ‐regarded cartographer who engraved DT wall map depicted in DT Vermeer Allegory . DT Visscher family RB had ties by marriage to DT illustrious Hondius firm , makers of DT Mercator atlases through DT first half of DT seventeenth century – PRP were thus kinsmen of mapping aristocracy – and their atelier in Amsterdam on DT Kalverstraat placed them in DT thick of all things cartographic . DT younger Visscher followed in his father 's professional footsteps and enjoyed considerable success , especially with his map of DT Americas . DT Americae went through several editions , RB in revised forms engraved by other ( sometimes competing ) ateliers ; PRP was appropriated for geography books , both as an insert and ( in a distilled form ) as a frontispiece ; and PRP was routinely copied and pirated outright , extending its successful run well into DT eighteenth century . 6 PRP became perhaps DT single most important early modern map of DT western hemisphere and certainly CD of DT most recognized images of DT NNP NNP . Its allegorical ( lower ) cartouche , moreover , became DT all ‐but standard representation of ‘ America ’ , an iconic image WDT crossed easily into other genres and NN . Nevertheless , despite its prestigious lineage and its titular promises of ‘ novelty ’ and ‘ accuracy ’ , DT map succeeded not so much for its exacting ‘ description ’ as for other , arguably pictorial reasons : for its highly embellished and appealing presentation of DT NNP NNP . DT actual cartographic content of DT map – DT particular delineations of DT lands and seas of DT western hemisphere – was scarcely JJ . PRP derived mostly from older materials , chiefly Joan Blaeu 's 1648 map of DT NN ; DT outlines of DT continents of these two maps are nearly identical . This habit of replication was not at all uncommon in early modern Dutch cartography ( as in other graphic arts ) , especially in DT sort of lavishly ornamented charts WDT became DT mainstay of Amsterdam ateliers . Nor can DT Visscher map make great claims for geographic meticulousness : a prominent ‘ California ’ floats off DT western coast of America , an island of DT mapmakers ’ imagination ; DT Great Lakes blend into CD truly great lake , which leaks its contents into DT Atlantic ; and DT long ‐sought Northwest Passage is offered optimistically as readily accessible , an open NN flowing freely into Asia . DT map 's promise of novelty and accuracy , in other words , is rhetoric – again , a fairly common ploy in early modern mapping ( as in late modern advertising ) . No Baconian empiricism here , but rather strategies WDT relate to DT techniques of rhetoric – pervasive across myriad Renaissance fields of enquiry – and to DT crafty practices of DT workshop . What likely sold DT map , more than its less ‐than ‐meticulous ‘ description ’ of DT continents , MD have been DT staging of DT Americae and DT ample ‘ adornments ’ WDT enriched Visscher 's product : DT four‐legged staffage WDT wander DT open , ultimately uncharted spaces of DT map ( what J. B. Harley famously called its ‘ silences ’ ) ; DT ethnographic vignettes WDT explicate DT NNP NNP 's indigenes ; and , not least , DT superb cartouches WDT fill DT upper and lower divisions of DT vast Pacific Ocean , at once distilling and framing DT continents in terms of space and narrative . 7 DT charming ‘ creatures in DT map ’ – these did not VB out of style in DT Renaissance – MD have appealed to a range of consumers . 8 Two handsome stag deer saunter across DT terrain of Eastern Canada ( Nova Francia on DT map ) ; PRP MD appear to await DT hunter 's arrow just as do DT tame deer of Ben Johnson 's poetic Penshurst or any other exemplary country house . A fox gambols across DT Great Plains ( a scene likewise redolent of DT Northern European countryside ) ; and beavers , coveted lately by Dutch merchants for their valuable pelts , pose obediently just inland of DT plainly demarcated empire of Nieu [ NNP ] Nederland .9 Further afield a pair of brown bears inhabit DT open , wild west ; meanwhile , a lone anteater has South America largely to himself . DT two‐legged staffage of tropical America – DT is , DT indigenous Americans – do no hunt any exotic fauna , but CD another . Their depiction in DT interior of Brazil , naked and engrossed in brutal warfare , offers a synoptic view of DT ‘ savage ’ Indian , here imagined as uncivilized if RB unobtrusive . As for DT pair of cartouches , CD occupying DT upper left and DT other DT lower left portion of Visscher 's print , these serve as DT dual anchors of DT map , DT dominant pictorial elements and DT keys to DT artefact 's interpretation ( plate 2 and plate 3 ) . PRP RB function to stage DT map 's motifs and – crucially – to elucidate its overall message . PRP is here IN both DT theatrical and narrative impulses of Dutch mapping come through most vividly and most pictorially . Both cartouches follow designs by Nicolaes Pietersz . Berchem , a highly regarded landscape painter , as PRP turns out ( and DT only son of Pieter Claesz , a master of still ‐life painting ) , who specialized in a form of idealized Italianate scenes popular in DT period ( a subgenre of Dutch landscape WDT lay conspicuously beyond Alpers ’ scrutiny as putatively un ‐Dutch ) . 10 DT pair of map vignettes work as an ensemble – DT device of DT parasol lures DT viewer 's eye from DT vignette below to DT balancing scene above – yet PRP is DT iconic figure of America herself , who gracefully gestures to DT map 's ‘ carved ’ title , WDT lies at DT heart of DT visual programme . Berchem at once allegorized and condensed DT essential qualities of DT cartographic space . He packed PRP all in : DT alluring personification of ‘ America ’ , decked out in a dainty feathered skirt and colourful feathered headdress ; DT pearls , barely visible around her neck , demonstrating DT region 's endemic richness ; DT classic bow and arrow , just to her right , alluding to her habit of hunting ( America RB bears a stylized club ) ; DT mounds of freshly mined gold ( or perhaps silver ) piling up at her feet , alongside stacks of ingots WDT indicate DT substantial mineral wealth of DT continent ; a pair of queerly coiled snakes , which reveal DT exotic naturalia of DT NNP NNP ; and DT central parasol , which shades America 's head from DT tropical sun.11 DT sum of DT parts tells DT story of DT whole : a massively rich , vaguely exotic , not ‐quite‐tamed NNP NNP . DT upper cartouche furnishes another allegory , which introduces a different angle on America , yet CD WDT is thematically complementary . A cluster of figures surrounds and supports a free‐floating , shield ‐like device , which bears a patron 's coat of arms and DT map 's dedication ( to Cornelius Witsen , a major supporter of overseas trade and exploration , on DT original NN , yet this varies with different printings ) . 12 DT predominant figure of this cluster , a European woman hovering in DT very upper‐left corner of DT map , represents Christian Faith : relatively plainly dressed , she points didactically with CD hand to a cross WDT she holds in her other hand and positions directly above DT other figures . She glances not to DT cross , however , but to a broad ‐shouldered , sharp‐taloned , demon ‐like figure below , who tumbles out of DT sky : an allegory of diabolism , ejected by DT Christian Church . An angel opposite and above gazes , mouth agape , at this falling devil and DT wondrous turn of events , while another heavenly figure , just to DT angel 's left , announces per clarion DT plunge of diabolism and DT spread of DT gospel . Finally , an Indian – DT figure situated closest to DT American landmass who wears DT same feathered headdress as DT principal ‘ American ’ figure of DT lower cartouche , in this way linking DT two vignettes – gazes in astonishment at DT allegory of Faith , whose good works have apparently converted him . DT cartouche recounts , in short , DT Church 's labours in DT NNP NNP : its presumed successes casting out false faiths and diabolisms , and evangelizing among DT American indigenes .13 To say IN these vignettes are staged is to identify both DT drama of Faith 's triumphs in DT NNP NNP and DT several marks of theatricality WDT hold DT ensemble together . DT parasol does this formally : not only does PRP lure DT eye upward , but PRP points directly to DT upper Indian ; were he to fall from DT sky , he might pierce himself on DT parasol 's tasselled spike . DT parasol functions , further , as a clever stage prop , a showy accoutrement WDT establishes DT ostentatious tropicality of America ( DT point of DT parasol abuts DT very words ‘ Tropicus Capricorni ’ ) . In fact , bona fide parasols commonly served as props in Baroque theatre ; and a particularly famous example of this , DT engraving of Anne Bracegirdle in her popular role as ‘ DT Indian Queen ’ , alludes subtly to DT Berchem allegory of America : feathers , pearls and parasol render DT renowned Restoration actress adequately ‘ exotic ’ . 14 Theatrical motions – of hands and other limbs – RB lend DT joint cartouches a dramatic , balletic cogency : arms akimbo on either side of DT title slab , hands gesturing instructively by DT allegorical figures both above and below , and DT scissoring feet of Christian Faith and her Indian protégé alike all serve to animate DT scene . DT swirling dress of Faith , swept up by DT heavenly winds , and her billowing and entirely theatrical shawl ( since this prop MD have been utterly extraneous in DT heavens ) suggest , yet again , tricks of DT stage – and , of course , of highly painterly composition . All of these devices heighten DT drama of DT map and thereby elucidate DT meaning of America . And all of these devices might RB prompt DT question : what is DT message of DT map and DT narrative arch WDT bridges Berchem 's upper and lower cartouches ? DT bond between Faith and America harks back to a proverbial wisdom WDT circulated in late medieval and early modern Europe about DT inverse relation of ‘ god ’ and ‘ gold ’ : wherever DT latter flowed abundantly , PRP was proposed , DT former was typically scarce ( and DT reverse ) . Such a conception of America and her endemic riches ‐cum ‐heathenism justified much of Habsburg Spain 's early colonial action in DT NNP NNP – DT conquest and simultaneous conversion of DT Indians . Yet PRP RB carried an implicit moral message , which gained traction among critics of DT Habsburg Conquista , especially in Northern Europe . And here PRP need to turn to a text , CD of JJ WDT MD have helped viewers read Visscher 's map . A late sixteenth ‐century poem , which captioned DT Dutch and German editions of an engraved allegory of America , commented poignantly on this contradictory relationship between DT European god and American gold ( words WDT punned even more in DT original : god and goud in Dutch ) : Here DT wondrous mineral wealth of America fosters her own decline ; she goes from benighted idolatry to miserable slavery . DT sixteenth ‐century allegory ( engraved by Adriaen Collaert after a design by Maarten de Vos ) expresses sympathy for DT doubly abused Indians . In DT Visscher map , however , with its relatively neutral ‐looking figure of Faith , not obviously Catholic nor Protestant , and with its pan‐colonial vision of DT Americas – NNP France , NNP Netherlands , and English ‐settled Virginia are all engraved into DT space , no less than DT nomenclature of Iberian colonial possessions in South America – DT message pertains to European colonialism and European exoticism writ large . DT map spells out DT evangelical and imperial rise of DT Old NNP in DT NNP . A map , however , even while PRP MD possess plentiful text and even while PRP might be read as and with DT help of text , is certainly not identical to text – PRP is textual and pictorial , not to mention cartographical . PRP is RB material , of course , and while EX MD have been textual and iconographic foundations for such maps as Visscher 's , EX were RB unmistakable evocations of craft and materiality . DT heritage of early modern Dutch cartography goes back not so much to Ptolemy , as Alpers argues , as to DT pioneering labours of Gerard Mercator and Abraham Ortelius , who drew on DT traditions of late ‐medieval mapping – highly pictorial and allegorical products , typically emanating from DT workshops of master illuminators – and on DT NN of craft . 16 Ortelius instinctively placed geography in DT context of art : famously in relationship to history ( ‘ Historiae oculus geographia ’ ) , yet RB in DT sphere of drama . 17 His Theatrum orbis terrarrum not only summons DT language of DT stage , but RB greets its audience on its engraved title page with a recognizable proscenium ( plate 4 ) . Mercator – whose posthumously published atlas RB adapted DT symbols of theatre on its title page – sprang more directly from DT milieu of craft . His main source of income in his early professional NNS came from DT fabrication of mathematical and navigational instruments – this placed him in DT vibrant , metal ‐working ateliers of northern Europe – and , for JJ of DT early cartographic projects with which PRP associate him ( his work with Gemma Frisius and Gaspar à Myrica , for example , on their terrestrial globe ) , he served as a highly skilled engraver of brass plates . He was RB an innovator in DT production of commercial globes ; and he was a remarkable italicist , who composed , designed and printed DT first instruction book of italic script published north of DT Alps . He mastered math and craft , art and ‘ NN ’ . More to DT point , DT actual , tangible maps of Mercator and Ortelius VBP out of their way in these early NNS to emphasize their affiliation with modes of craft and material arts . Both mapmakers ’ ateliers , in producing DT first generation of ‘ craft maps ’ – this is DT geographer John Pickles ’ term for DT highly pictorial , thickly ornamented maps WDT developed in DT late sixteenth ‐century Netherlands18 – make habitual reference to DT process of their maps ’ production and to DT material arts whence PRP came . Thus does Mercator 's Orbis Terrae Compendiosa Descriptio make literal reference to its maker 's background in brass ‐work by DT depiction of an armillary sphere in DT upper centre of DT map 's design , while RB making more figurative allusions to metalwork in DT strapwork surrounding DT armillary ; in DT elaborate fretwork bearing DT JJ hemispheres ; and in DT clever metallic tooling of DT engraved frame WDT encases DT NN map ( plate 5 ) . These devices serve to emphasize DT ‘ thickness ’ of early modern cartography – its broader project of converting three ‐dimensional space into two – while RB invoking DT material arts with which Mercator ( and JJ map illuminators before him ) sought to affiliate himself . Thus , too , does Ortelius offer CD of his most celebrated cartographic images – Abrahami Patriarchae Peregrinatio et Vita ( 1590 ) , which charts DT life and journeys of DT Old Testament patriarch Abraham , DT mapmaker 's namesake – as a trompe l'oeil WDT invokes DT illustrious art of tapestry ( plate 6 ) . Meanwhile , several other graphic techniques make more subtle gestures to various other material arts : twenty ‐two circular medallion vignettes , so ‐called since PRP evoke DT bronze medallions much in fashion at DT NN , do DT heavy ‐lifting narration of Abraham 's life ; two superb cartouches display DT map 's textual apparatus and once again reference DT art of strapwork ( DT interior sample with garlands being a particularly fine example of DT genre ) ; and two decorative masks – ‘ hung ’ on a strapwork cartouche , which is ‘ fastened ’ to a cartographic tapestry – not only lend a sense of depth to this already densely materialized map , but RB allude to DT NN of theatre . DT map , in short , offers a tour de force of spatial manipulation – to VB along with its textual and pictorial narration . Some three ‐quarters of a century later , Nicolaes Visscher and Nicolaes Berchem likewise expended considerable effort in thickening their map . PRP collaboratively layered several illusions of space in DT Americae engraving . Careful hatching around DT edges of DT continents and scattered islands lends a sense of depth to DT hemisphere , a quality further enhanced by DT ‘ shadows ’ cast by DT ships at NN and DT animals on shore ( see plate 1 ) . This imparts to what otherwise might be perceived as flat geographic space DT property of density , and PRP grants DT map 's viewers an optical sense of verticality , as if PRP were observing DT continents from an elevated , almost atmospheric altitude . DT swirling figures of DT upper vignette induce a dizzying lateral movement yet further up ; PRP are now in DT skies , if not quite DT heavens , where shadow and wind still persist ( see plate 3 ) . DT curling ( upper ) cartouche , which carries DT map 's dedication on DT form of a wooden shield , RB plays with DT materiality of DT shield : a shield bears a shield , as PRP were . In DT lower vignette , space moves more horizontally . Here EX is a quality of earthiness , as opposed to DT lofty airiness above , and DT conceit WDT DT ground slopes downward along with DT figures behind DT ‘ slab ’ of cartouche who recede gently into DT horizon ( and presumably further into DT subterranean mines from where America 's gold and silver originate ) ( see plate 2 ) . And if wind animates DT upper scene , DT sun plays DT role below , casting shadows over DT figure of America , thereby RB accentuating DT tropical heat of DT land . DT parasol , DT most tangible of accessories of DT tropics and theatre alike , stylishly shields ‘ America ’ from DT elements , and in this way RB pulls DT narrative spaces together . Craft maps , a genre developed outstandingly in DT picture‐rich culture of DT early modern Netherlands , drew from DT arts of painting and engraving , and from DT fields of geography and DT material arts . Their form owed much to DT practices of ateliers : to printerly habits of delineating and ‘ describing ’ , to be sure , yet RB to modes of narrating and embellishing space , of crafting and thickening maps . Indeed , within DT intricate matrix of early modern Dutch workshops , DT makers of maps borrowed as well as loaned ; images from cartographic sources and geography books moved from printed NN ( textual as well as iconographic ) , yet RB to material arts . ‘ America ’ MD redeploy over DT coming decades from maps to forms of tapestry , ceramic ( especially porcelain , once Europe mastered its own techniques of production ) , lacquer ‐ware , cut glass , and so on , as DT image steadily gained in popularity . Visscher 's cartographic images , in other words , moved from DT two ‐dimensional space of DT map back to DT three ‐dimensional space of DT decorative arts from where Mercator and Ortelius had drawn their earlier inspiration . Both DT lineage and DT influence of ‘ craft ’ maps are rich in numerous ways . Early modern Dutch maps are anything but mere ‘ description ’ , and PRP most certainly illustrate , pace Alpers , abundant ‘ pictorial marks of [ social and political ] authority ’ . CD PRP illustrate and narrate and dramatize much more , and much WDT speaks rather productively to Alpers ’ and our concerns with Dutch visual culture . For maps such as those produced by Visscher and his contemporaries ask PRP – just as other prints and paintings do – to VB about space and its representation . Dutch maps use graphic forms and pictorial devices to stage space and to present DT drama of space from multiple angles and perspectives . Visscher 's map , complemented by Berchem 's vignettes , displays DT drama of European expansion from up high and down low , from DT fauna‐rich interiors of DT American continents to DT ship ‐peppered seas WDT surround them . PRP invokes DT tricks of theatre – rhetoric and gesture , evocation and insinuation , props and propaganda – to narrate space , in this case DT spaces of European conquest , colonialism and empire . And PRP narrates DT space in assorted ways , just as history narrates and as other textual and pictorial genres narrate : to be DT eye of history is not necessarily to be wholly mute ( or purely descriptive ) . PRP does all this , again as other visual sources do , as a means to entice its viewers . DT Americae beckon in myriad ways : Berchem 's figure of ‘ America ’ seduces its viewer with her opulent pearls and exotic feathers , tactile prompts of supreme allure ; Visscher 's sheet map invokes multiple registers of materiality , encouraging an intense sense of touch , depth and space ; and DT Americae , of course , arouse wide ‐ranging colonial desires , which surely reached across to several early modern European aspirants of imperial worlds . Early modern Dutch maps , in these JJ ways , surely exhibit DT shared impulses of painting and cartography , yet this does not so much demonstrate a flattened mapping impulse in Dutch art as PRP reveals DT rich , thick , pictorial impulses in Dutch maps ."

DT above tweet garnered DT attention of Neil DeGrasse Tyson , famed astrophysicist .

DT flat NNP belief has grown in popularity recently as a result of high - profile celebrities and athletes supporting DT belief DT NNP is flat .

DT GoFundMe campaign plans to launch multiple satellites into space , which will allow DT rapper to observe and disprove DT widely held belief IN DT NNP is not flat .

PRP was built with such precision WDT our current technology cannot replicate PRP . Historical analysis shows IN DT Pyramids were built between 2589 and 2504 BC . EX are so JJ interesting facts about this Pyramid WDT PRP baffles archaeologists , NNS , astronomers and tourists . Here are DT facts : 01 . DT pyramid is estimated to have around 2,300,000 stone blocks WDT weigh from 2 to 30 tons each and EX are even some blocks WDT weigh over 50 tons . 02 . DT Pyramid of Menkaure , DT Pyramid of Khafre and DT Great Pyramid of Khufu are precisely aligned with DT Constellation of Orion . 03 . DT base of DT pyramid covers 55,000 m2 ( 592,000 ft 2 ) with each side greater than 20,000 m2 ( 218,000 ft2 ) in area . 04 . DT interior temperature is constant and equals DT average temperature of DT NN , 20 Degrees Celsius ( 68 Degrees Fahrenheit ) . 05 . DT outer mantle was composed of 144,000 casing stones , all of them highly polished and flat to an accuracy of 1/100th of an inch , about 100 inches thick and weighing approx . 15 tons each . 06 . DT cornerstone foundations of DT pyramid have ball and socket construction capable of dealing with heat expansion and earthquakes . 07 . DT mortar used is of an unknown origin ( Yes , no explanation given ) . PRP has been analyzed and its chemical composition is known but PRP ca n’t be reproduced . PRP is stronger than DT stone and still holding up today . 08 . PRP was originally covered with casing stones ( made of highly polished limestone ) . These casing stones reflected DT sun ’s light and made DT pyramid shine IN a jewel . PRP are no longer present being used by Arabs to build mosques after an earthquake in DT 14th century loosened JJ of them . PRP has been calculated IN DT original pyramid with its casing stones MD act IN gigantic mirrors and reflect light so powerful IN PRP MD be visible from DT moon as a shining star on NN . Appropriately , DT ancient Egyptians called DT Great Pyramid “ Ikhet ” , meaning DT “ Glorious Light ” . How these blocks were transported and assembled into DT pyramid is still a mystery . – http://www.gizapyramid.com/general.htm 09 . Aligned True North : DT Great Pyramid is DT most accurately aligned structure in existence and faces true north with only 3/60th of a degree of error . DT position of DT North Pole moves over NN and DT pyramid was exactly aligned at CD NN . 10 . Center of Land Mass : DT Great Pyramid is located at DT center of DT land mass of DT NN . DT east / west parallel WDT crosses DT most land and DT north / south meridian WDT crosses DT most land intersect in two places on DT NN , CD in DT ocean and DT other at DT Great Pyramid . 11 . DT four faces of DT pyramid are slightly concave , DT only pyramid to have been built this way . 12 . DT centers of DT four sides are indented with an extraordinary degree of precision forming DT only 8 sided pyramid , this effect is not visible from DT ground or from a distance but only from DT air , and then only under DT proper lighting conditions . This phenomenon is only detectable from DT air at dawn and sunset on DT spring and autumn equinoxes , when DT sun casts shadows on DT pyramid . 13 . DT granite coffer in DT “ King ’s Chamber ” is too big to fit through DT passages and so PRP must have been put in place during construction . 14 . DT coffer was made out of a block of solid granite . This MD have required bronze saws 8 - 9 ft. long set with teeth of sapphires . Hollowing out of DT interior MD require tubular drills of DT same material applied with a tremendous vertical force . 15 . Microscopic analysis of DT coffer reveals IN PRP was made with a fixed point drill WDT used hard jewel bits and a drilling force of 2 tons . Related : DT Real Builders of DT Pyramids 16 . DT Great Pyramid had a swivel door entrance at CD NN . Swivel doors were found in only two other pyramids : Khufu ’s father and grandfather , Sneferu and Huni , respectively . 17 . PRP is reported IN when DT pyramid was first broken into IN DT swivel door , weighing some 20 tons , was so well balanced IN PRP MD be opened by pushing out from DT inside with only minimal force , but when closed , was so perfect a fit WDT PRP MD scarcely be detected and EX was not enough crack or crevice around DT edges to gain a grasp from DT outside . 18 . With DT mantle in place , DT Great Pyramid MD be seen from DT mountains in Israel and probably DT moon as well . CD . DT weight of DT pyramid is estimated at 5,955,000 tons . Multiplied by 10^8 gives a reasonable estimate of DT NN ’s mass . 20 . DT Descending Passage pointed to DT pole star Alpha Draconis , circa 2170 - 2144 BCE . This was DT North Star at DT point in NN . No other star has aligned with DT passage since then . 21 . DT southern shaft in DT King ’s Chamber pointed to DT star Al Nitak ( Zeta Orionis ) in DT constellation Orion , circa 2450 BCE DT Orion constellation was associated with DT Egyptian god Osiris . No other star aligned with this shaft during DT NN in history . 22 . Sun ’s Radius : Twice DT perimeter of DT bottom of DT granite coffer times 10^8 is DT sun ’s mean radius . [ 270.45378502 Pyramid Inches* 10^8 = 427,316 miles ] 23 . DT curvature designed into DT faces of DT pyramid exactly matches DT radius of DT NN . 24 . Khufu ’s pyramid , known as DT great pyramid of Giza , is DT oldest and largest , rising at 481 feet ( 146 meters ) . Archaeologists say PRP was DT tallest structure in DT NN for about 3 , 800 NNS . 25 . DT relationship between Pi ( p ) and Phi ( F ) is expressed in DT fundamental proportions of DT Great Pyramid .

A paradigm shift is a fundamental NN in approach or underlining assumptions . For example , when Pythagoras proposed IN DT NNP was round instead of flat , DT foundation of NN and NNS ’s understanding of DT NN was completely changed . Similarly , when DT Industrial Revolution took place EX was a complete shift in manufacturing , lifestyle , and economics . A paradigm shift can literally shake a society to its core , taking PRP off its current path and putting PRP on a brand JJ NN . Though PRP might appear DT opposite in DT corporate controlled mainstream NN , PRP appears IN DT entire NN is in DT very early stages of a paradigm shift . These shifts take place in JJ of DT worlds most basic elements and redefine how life functions . Here are 8 signs DT NN is undergoing a paradigm shift : 1. DT Power of DT Internet and DT Age of Information DT Internet is arguably DT greatest invention in DT history of man . Never in our known history has man had access to such a broad range of diverse information from all over DT NN at DT tips of his fingers . JJ forget IN DT Internet has only really been commercialized in DT west since DT early 1990 ’s and its spread across DT NN has n’t even come close to peaking yet . DT Internet is undoubtedly giving rise to DT Age of Information as NNS become more awake to what ’s really VBG on in DT NN . A multitude of information is now accessible if PRP knows where to look . NNS can now learn JJ skills or hear different versions of DT truth in mere minutes . DT Internet is not only giving rise to an open access of information , but communication is almost instantaneous all over DT NN . PRP is paramount IN DT Internet remain an open decentralized system in which everyone can freely add and operate if this paradigm shift is to continue . PRP feeds almost all other shifts . 2. DT Ascent Of DT Independent Non-Corporate Online NN Thanks solely to DT Internet , DT rise in independent journalism has taken off . Alternative NN has become an increasingly popular choice for those wishing to stay truly informed , especially younger generations . NNS are continually switching off cable NN ( cable TV all together ) , and instead resorting to online sources . While mainstream NN is still DT number CD source of current NN events for DT masses , DT tide is slowly changing as NNS are awakening to DT fact IN corporate sponsored NN is mostly propaganda and half - truths . War is becoming much harder to justify as independent journalists have shined DT light on what DT powers WDT be never wanted anyone to see . A prime example is DT conflict in Syria in which DT establishment , despite DT lack of popular support , so desperately wanted to start a war IN when DT rebels PRP were funding used chemical weapons , PRP was then blamed on DT Assad NN to protect their investment and design . Thanks to independent journalists , a war has so far been averted since PRP was revealed IN DT U.S. was in bed with DT rebel groups and PRP was DT rebels who used DT chemical weapons . This JJ faction of journalism will give peace a legitimate chance as all dirty laundry is now being aired and corrupt alliances exposed . This in turn has allowed JJ NNS to deprogram from DT countless NN PRP have taken in over DT NNS and see DT NN through a clearer lens in which DT truth is more evident . Though PRP will never be broadcast on mainstream NN , DT real threat of a U.S. dollar collapse as DT NN reserve currency is very real . DT paradigm of central bank controlled economies WDT can issue credit and zero percent interest rates through nearly unlimited printing of money backed by nothing is an illusion WDT is beginning to break down . PRP ’s not just DT U.S. dollar WDT ’s under threat , but JJ other central currencies such as DT Euro and Yen . Massive equity bubbles are being blown up by this cheap credit along with massive debt WDT will be nearly impossible to pay back with DT current economies in which only DT very elite benefit . JJ NNS are waking up to DT fact IN , IN all other bubbles , these bubbles will burst and PRP are beginning to break away from DT dollar . Examples include DT buildup of a JJ central bank in DT emerging economy of DT BRICS group , DT countless NNS passing trade agreements in which bypassing DT U.S. dollar ( including agreements in oil ) , and DT persistent selling of treasury stocks by DT Chinese NN who quite often are DT last resort buyer of U.S. debt . Not only has EX been a shift in DT pecking order of fiat paper currencies , but decentralized crypto-currencies IN Bitcoin are threatening DT very system of fiat money and DT centralized control a select few elite have on DT system through central banks . This MD shift power worldwide . 4. DT Rise of DT Peer - to - Peer Economy A Peer - to - Peer ( P20 ) Economy is a de-centralized model whereby two individuals interact to buy or sell goods and services directly with each other , without intermediation by a third - party , or without DT use of a company or business . PRP see this being used by companies IN Air BnB , Uber , Craigslist , Sidecar , and Dogvacay among others . Often referred to as a sharing economy , EX is no centralized control of power , allowing NNS to more directly profit from their goods / services rather than pay unnecessary middlemen along DT way . This is a trend WDT is sure to grow as technology makes PRP easier for NNS to make PRP on their own and allows for NNS to own their means of production and finished goods , instead of just being paid in DT production process . DT peer - to - peer economy is RB possible through DT abundance of goods already out RB , allowing for goods to be shared and recycled rather than thrown away and reproduced . Not only is DT peer - to - peer economy growing , but JJ young NNS are ditching DT career 9 - 5 jobs and branching off into independent careers or job hopping . DT top down business model in economics has now found a legitimate system in which a decentralized bottom up approach gives DT power back to DT NNS . DT shift towards renewable NN is a forgone conclusion as renewable NN is DT way of DT future . In fact , DT shift looks to be happening faster than NNS realize . According to DT NNP NNP Initiative , “ Numerous scenarios projected levels of renewable NN for 2020 WDT already were surpassed by 2010 . ” DT IEA VBZ IN , “ In 2012 , DT NN relied on renewable sources for around 13.2 % of its total primary NN supply , and in 2013 renewables accounted for almost 22 % of JJ electricity generation . ” With increased technological capabilities along with ever - growing concern over DT NN of DT environment , DT NN is beginning to not only shift towards renewables , but DT power over NN supplies and grids is decentralizing . For example , home solar panels or DT JJ Tesla Powerwall , MD enable NNS to access their own NN directly from DT sun without VBG through middlemen . Another example is a local city IN Burlington , VT being DT first city in DT U.S. to use 100 % renewable NN ; even whole NNS IN Paraguay , Iceland and Norway being 100 % renewable . Cheap localized NN is on DT horizon along with DT very real possibility Nikola Teslaonce envisioned , which is a NN of free NN . DT reemergence of organic food is not only on DT rise , but DT use of farmers markets and locally grown food is on DT rise as well . According to DT Non GMO project , “ In more than 60 NNS around DT NN , including Australia , Japan , and all of DT NNS in DT European Union , EX are significant restrictions or outright bans on DT production and sale of GMOs . ” DT rise is so strong IN according to DT Organic Trade Association , “ Supply shortages [ of organics ] are CD of DT greatest challenges facing DT industry today . Despite continued growth in production , handlers are not able to keep up with demand . ” Thanks in large part to DT Internet and non-corporate sponsored research , NNS are beginning to understand DT importance behind knowing exactly what ’s in DT food CD consumes and how PRP directly correlates to NN . This has put mounting pressure on food businesses to adapt . DT signs are already evident as Chipotle sees their profits increase while operating completely Non-GMO , while sales giants such as McDonalds see profits continue to decrease amidst NN concerns over their food . JJ are beginning to truly care what goes into their body and DT rise of localized non-organic food in this country is a direct result of this NN - conscious shift . 7. DT Understanding Of a NN of Abundance As Gandhi famously VBD , “ DT NN has enough for every man ’s needs , but not for every man ’s greed . ” NNS are finally awaking to DT fact IN EX is enough to VB around , just not with DT current systems in place . No NN is saying EX is enough for everyone to live at current western consumption rates , however with adoption of renewable NN , JJ forms of decentralized NN and economics , and DT increase in DT usage of technological capabilities , EX is more than enough for everyone in DT NN to live happily . For example , DT NN produces enough food for 10 billion NNS , yet JJ VBP starving as a result of faulty systems of distribution . Another example is NN ; EX is more than enough NN on DT NN , but PRP ’s DT JJ systems WDT VBP in DT way of technology . DT notion of scarcity has long haunted DT systems of NN and economics , but now a JJ paradigm of abundance is beginning to take root in DT minds of NNS . DT Venus project is a prime example of an alternative resource based economy in which sustainability and resource supply are taken into account . A NN of abundance with zero emission is no longer just a pipe dream , but MD very well become a reality as NNS VBP in terms of abundance . Finally a consciousness shift is underway in which NNS are starting to see themselves as more than just individual NNS operating in an isolated bubble , but instead as a connected piece in DT collective consciousness of NN NNP . DT Internet , along with DT increased capacity for travel , has allowed NNS from all over DT NN to connect . So JJ parts of DT JJ society have become interconnected and NNS are beginning to take notice of not only their own country , but NNS abroad . JJ are beginning to realize IN CD group of NNS suffering means everyone is suffering . This interconnection to everything has given rise to practices such as meditation , yoga , and travel , as well as DT continued JJ acceptance towards mind altering organic substances IN marijuana and mushrooms . NNS are beginning to emotionally connect to life all over DT NN and not just their immediate home and surroundings . This JJ reality is showing NNS IN EX is more to life than money , as connection to all living things is equally , if not more , valuable . As PRP can see , DT NN is very much in DT early stages of a shift in consciousness and design . These shifts are leading to a growing decentralization movement in which DT power controls of society are taken from DT few and given to DT JJ . Obviously , EX is a very strong force at play WDT is fighting against this paradigm shift . This force is fighting for centralization of power in almost all facets of life . EX can be no doubt of DT presence of this resistance when PRP examines DT ever - increasing wealth and power gap WDT is out of control in this country . DT actions taken by these elite organizations are getting more radical and desperate by DT day . With all DT being VBN , DT JJ paradigm shift has CD advantage WDT I believe will be DT game changer , and DT ’s DT will of DT NNS . This is not just DT NNS of a a single country , but internationally , as VBN JJ movements such as Occupy Wall street , DT Arab Spring , and March Against Monsanto are happening simultaneously all over DT NN around central causes . So wake - up and participate , for PRP are in DT early stages of a revolutionary paradigm shift in DT consciousness of DT masses WDT can truly VB society for DT better . An avid free - thinker , Tim has set out on a mission in search of DT truth in whatever form PRP MD come . Ever since his awakening several NNS ago , his passion for knowledge and justice has led him on a journey into deep research , cultural travel , and complete expansion of DT mind . Tim feels as if DT information freely flowing into DT hands of DT NN , due to DT dawn of DT Internet , cannot be stopped at this point , so he has made PRP his goal to help facilitate and breakdown this complex stream of information , so IN others can accelerate their own awakening and be part of DT inevitable NN happening in society .

Lamentations 3:26 , “ PRP is good IN a man should both hope and quietly wait for DT salvation of DT LORD . ” Is n't DT a precious Bible verse ! Lamentations 3:26 , “ PRP is good IN a man should both hope and quietly wait for DT salvation of DT LORD . ” EX is nothing JJ under DT sun . Just as today , PRP is human nature to be selfish . God had wonderfully blessed DT Hebrews , but PRP took PRP all for granted and did n't appreciate what God had done for them . Moses warned DT NNS to beware of forgetting about God in lieu of all His tremendous blessings upon them . God had miraculously parted DT Red NNP right in front of them , so IN PRP even walked across on dry ground ! Yet DT first thing PRP did when PRP got to DT other side is COMPLAIN IN PRP had no NN . This is unbelievable , read PRP for yourself ... Exodus 15:19 and 22 and 24 , “ For DT horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into DT NN , and DT LORD brought again DT waters of DT NN upon them ; but DT NNS of Israel went on dry land in DT midst of DT NN . ... So Moses brought Israel from DT Red NNP , and PRP went out into DT wilderness of Shur ; and PRP went three days in DT wilderness , and found no NN . ... And DT NNS murmured against Moses , saying , What shall PRP drink ? ” I VBP disgusted just from reading DT . Those Hebrew ingrates — who had just witnessed God deliver them from Pharaoh 's army , walking across DT Red NNP floor on dry ground , then watching Pharaoh 's army ( men and horses alike ) all drown when DT waters returned upon them — started complaining just three days later in DT Wilderness WDT PRP had no NN , failing to have faith in DT power and love of their great omnipotent God . PRP is incredibly amazing to me . Moreover , DT Jews were warned again and again by Moses DT prophet , to stop their complaining , lest PRP destroy them , but PRP did n't listen . After complaining for DT TENTH NN , God had finally had enough and banned them from ever entering into DT Promised Land . God hates DT sin of complaining ! HE HATES PRP !!! Pastor Jack Hyles preaches a powerful sermon on this very topic about complaining in a sermon titled : “ DT HOTTEST HELL OF ALL ! ” NNS ( whether PRP be fellow Christians , preachers , family , acquaintances or strangers ) are always VBG to hurt our feelings . PRP will be inconsiderate , disappoint , let PRP down , gossip about PRP , judge PRP and make PRP sad if I focus on NNS — so I live above DT clouds where Jesus lives ! America has forgotten DT God of DT Bible . Deuteronomy 6:12 , “ Then beware lest thou forget DT LORD , which brought thee forth out of DT land of Egypt , from DT house of bondage . ” So often in life , NNS receive good at DT hand of God , but return nothing in DT way of gratitude . In DT Old Testament , PRP learn about a godly man named Job , who made a remarkable statement to his wife when she suggested IN he curse God and die . Job 2:10 , “ But he VBD unto her , Thou speakest as CD of DT foolish women speaketh . What ? shall PRP receive good at DT hand of God , and shall PRP not receive evil ? In all this did not Job sin with his lips . ” Oh IN PRP MD all adopt DT godly attitude of Job , who understood ( as our text passage from 1st Peter shows ) IN life includes good and bad . I choose to praise God for DT good in my life , and blame DT Devil for DT bad . PRP is not God 's fault IN I have made some stupid and unwise decisions in my life . Blessed be DT name of DT Lord , for He is faithful , fair and good to all ! Psalms 145:9 , “ DT LORD is good to all : and his tender mercies are over all his works . ” DT heathen NN is always placing God on trial , but PRP are DT ones who refuse to obey His inspired Words in DT Holy Bible . Job 9:3 , “ If he [ man ] will contend with him [ God ] , he can not answer him CD of a thousand . ” No NN can ever blame God ( Romans 1:20 ) , for He is faithful . 2nd Timothy 2:13 , “ If PRP believe not , yet he abideth faithful : he can not deny himself . ” As Ron Hamilton ( Patch DT Pirate ) says , every Christian should have : “ DT GRATITUDE ATTITUDE ! ” Kindly , PRP are getting what PRP deserve as a foolish nation for forsaking DT God of DT Holy Bible . What can PRP expect from NNS who have grown up void of DT knowledge of God ? I read an article today about two 10 NN old looking boys who are guilty of a carjacking . To add insult to injury , Freemasons ( who control DT NNP NNPS ) have introduced DT blatant lies of Evolution in all JJ schools to intentionally lead impressionable NNS away from God , misleading them to VB IN PRP came from a Big Bang , stardust and from DT same biological source as gorillas . What can PRP expect from such abused NNS ? How can PRP expect NNS deprived of a God-centered education to exemplify God - JJ behavior ? God is love ! To deliberately withhold a God-centered education from a child , and substitute PRP with a fraudulent system of lies WDT reduce humanity to DT level of animals , is a cruel form of child abuse ! DT whole scam of DT rights of “ atheists ” not to have to hear DT teachings of DT Bible in JJ schools has destroyed DT fiber of our society ! I do n't generally follow DT NN because PRP is so depressing , but I have been doing a lot of research for my ministry and reading through crime NN lately . I did n't realize how bad things have become in American society . This is DT obvious horrifying consequence of removing and banning DT inspired Word of God from NNS 's daily lives in JJ school classrooms since 1963 . DT Holy Bible has Always Been DT Answer ! PRP cannot deny DT to DT same degree WDT our country has abandoned DT Word of God , to DT same degree society is VBG to DT Devil ! I have RB been watching DT Forensic Files , using amazing NN to solve horrifying crimes . DT evildoer culprits are sometimes police officers , fire investigates , pastors and churchgoers . PRP is unbelievable what human beings are capable of ! Truly DT human race is depraved , just as DT Holy Bible says . Romans 3:10 - 11 , “ As PRP is written , EX is none righteous , no , not CD : EX is none IN understandeth , EX is none WDT seeketh after God . ” DT city of Chicago is CD of DT most dangerous places on NN to live . DT following article is just from CD weekend ... 7 Killed , 46 Wounded In Weekend Shootings ; ‘ PRP ’s Destroying DT Fiber Of Our Communities ’ CHICAGO ( CBS ) — Dozens of NNS were shot in Chicago over DT weekend , including two mass shootings in less than three hours on Sunday . In all , seven NNS were killed and 46 others were wounded in shootings since Friday evening . More than a dozen NNS were wounded , CD of them fatally , in a pair of mass shootings in DT Lawndale neighborhood early Sunday . DT first shooting happened around 1:20 a.m. near Roosevelt and Francisco in Douglas Park . Police VBD a group of NNS was standing in DT park , when someone opened fire from a black Chevrolet Camaro . Seven NNS were wounded : • A 21 - NN - old man shot in DT groin was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in critical condition ; • A 25 - NN - old woman shot in DT arm and leg was taken to Mount Sinai , where she was stabilized ; • A 20 - NN - old man shot in DT right side was taken to Stroger Hospital , where he was stabilized ; • A CD - NN - old woman shot in DT right leg was taken to Stroger , where she was stabilized ; • A 22 - NN - old woman was taken to Mount Sinai , where she was stabilized ; • A 21 - NN - old man shot in DT left leg was taken to Mount Sinai , where he was stabilized ; • A 23 - NN - old man shot in DT chest and hand took himself to Mount Sinai , where he was stabilized . Less than three hours later , eight NNS were shot in Lawndale , near 18th and Kildare around 3:45 a.m. , when unknown s hooters opened fire on a large group of NNS at a block party . CD man , 33 - NN - old Demetrius Flowers , was killed , and seven other NNS were wounded : • A 35 - NN - old man shot in DT forehead was taken to Mount Sinai , where he was stabilized ; • A 28 - NN - old man shot in DT hip was taken to Mount Sinai , where he was stabilized ; • A 27 - NN - old man shot in DT foot was taken to Mount Sinai , where he was stabilized ; • A 28 - NN - old man shot in DT leg Mount Sinai , where he was treated and released ; • A 14 - NN - old boy was shot in DT thigh , and was taken to Stroger , where he was stabilized ; • A 21 - NN - old woman suffered a graze wound to DT thumb , and was treated and released at St. Margaret Hospital ; • A CD - NN - old woman was shot in DT head , and was taken to Stroger , where she was treated and released . Flowers ’ father , VBD PRP ’s DT second son he ’s lost to violence . “ Please stop . PRP ’s killing our families , PRP ’s destroying DT fiber of our communities . PRP have to stop this senseless killing , because if PRP do n’t , EX ’s nothing VBG to be left . EX ’s nothing VBG to be left , ” Keith Flowers VBD . CD young man unfortunately murdered over DT weekend in Chicago , was 33 NN old Demetrius Flowers . His father , Keith Flowers , made DT following JJ statement : I am not trying to be unkind , God knows my heart , but this father is preaching to DT choir . Gang thugs do n't care ! Keith is making his statement to law - abiding citizens . I noticed in DT preceding NN story IN 90 % of DT NNS shot were very young , close to 20 NNS old . DT speaks volumes ! Our youth are infested with evil today , because PRP have been deprived of God 's Word in ungodly schools . Luciferians are behind DT destruction of America ! All high - level Freemasons worship Lucifer , DT 99 % lower initiates are woefully naive . DT same is true of DT CIA , U.S. NN , Mormonism and other subversive and subverted groups . I am very sorry for Mr. Flowers ' loss in DT death of his son , and I am not belittling him in any way , God forbid . I am simply pointing out IN PRP is not VBG to VB anything to make statements about how NNS need to stop shooting each other . NNS need DT Word of God ! If PRP do n't allow thoughts of greed to dwell in your mind , then those thoughts cannot fester . No NN suddenly goes out and purchases a life insurance policy on their spouse , and then plots to murder them in a clever way to make PRP look IN an accident . Long before such wickedness came into DT person 's mind , EX was already a heart of greed and ungodliness . DT major underlying personal theme WDT I take away from DT whole Forensic Files series is DT following passage of Scripture from DT Holy Bible ... DT is DT great truth WDT needs to be engrained into DT minds of NNS , every single day of their school NNS . If I had my way , every child MD recite this passage of Scripture along with their teacher every day , at DT beginning of each class , so IN PRP MD be so engrained in their soul , IN PRP MD be a permanent part of their soul for DT rest of their life . NNS today do n't love God . Their parents who grew up in America 's Godless JJ school system , do n't love God . Their grandparents , who grew up in America 's ungodly school system after 1963 , do n't love God . Anyone in DT NNP NNPS today under DT age of 74 , did n't hear DT inspired Word of God read in a JJ school . DT is why crime is epidemic today across DT NNP NNPS , and PRP can be truthfully VBN of our culture : I am VBG to preach DT truth until I can no longer do so — DT KING JAMES BIBLE IS DT ANSWER !!!!!!! Everyone who is guilty of hurting another human being , to provide DT heinous crime to make another episode of Forensic Files , failed to heed DT Bible 's command to LOVE GOD and LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR ! DT two greatest commandments in DT Word of God are to LOVE GOD , and LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOUR . Do n't ever forget DT truth and PRP wo n't VB astray ! As Brother Lester Roloff ( 1914 - 1982 ) VBD — these two commandments are really just CD — TO LOVE ! If PRP fall in love with our Maker , and allow God to love PRP , and allow God to love our fellow man through PRP , then PRP will never intentionally harm another human being . Amen ! I sure hope somebody is listening . Every Christian believer needs to be on - guard against sin continually , because anyone is capable of committing DT worst sins under DT right circumstances . DT is what I mean by my article title : “ Love , Forgive , Help , Work And Pray . ” No NN is above sin ! NO CD ! DT Bible admonishes PRP to take heed if PRP are misled to VB PRP are doing okay , because PRP MD commit an unthinkable crime just IN DT criminals PRP read about . Every criminal at CD NN was a law - abiding citizen ! Proverbs 4:23 , “ Keep thy heart with all diligence ; for out of PRP are DT issues of life . ” DT Bible verse means to deal with DT small sinful thoughts in your mind , before PRP grow into evil behavior ! I VBP to VB right , do right , and live right , to please God and stay out of trouble . I VBP to : “ Love , Forgive , Help , Work And Pray . ” If PRP maintain DT godly attitude — of always loving others , and forgiving everyone , and helping everyone , and working honestly to stay busy , and praying for God 's power and protection from evil — PRP will joyously prosper in DT Christian life . EX is no joy IN knowing PRP are right with God and man . I VBP to live in such a way IN no NN can justly accuse me of doing evil . ... Quite often , I have web visitors confide in me IN PRP are struggling with DT sins of lust , hatred , pornography , pride , rebellion , et cetera . I always try to help them in a spirit of meekness . Galatians 6:1 , “ Brethren , if a man be overtaken in a fault , ye which are spiritual , restore such an NN in DT spirit of meekness ; considering thyself , lest thou RB be tempted . ” DT Bible teaches PRP in 2nd Corinthians 10:5 , “ Casting down imaginations , and every high thing WDT exalteth itself against DT knowledge of God , and bringing into captivity every thought to DT obedience of Christ . ” Here PRP learn how to live right ! When a sinful thought enters into our mind , PRP are supposed to CAST DOWN DT THOUGHT with DT inspired Word of God ( i.e. , DT King James Bible ) . By doing DT , PRP prevent DT Devil from filling your heart to do evil . I refuse to have a garbage pail for a mind . Anyone can choose to live right ! In DT Old Testament , Job was a godly man who purposed in his heart to VB and live right . Job 31:1 , “ I made a covenant with mine eyes ; why then should I VB upon a maid ? ” I receive e-mails from young men who are struggling with lust and pornography . DT is a very dangerous vice ! DT way to handle PRP is to take control of your thought - life and abstain from fleshly lusts . 1st Peter 2:11 , “ Dearly beloved , I beseech PRP as strangers and pilgrims , abstain from fleshly lusts , which war against DT soul . ” DT Bible commands men to abstain from DT lusts of DT flesh . To look at filthy images is a CHOICE ! Until PRP start making DT right choices , PRP 'll never gain victory over any sin . Each NN PRP make DT wrong sinful choice , PRP makes PRP a little easier to make another sinful choice , until PRP turn evil , and eventually PRP 'll be DT next episode of Forensic Files ! Behind every tragedy in human character is a slow process of wicked thinking ! Christians Are Pilgrims Not Settlers On NNP PRP is important for every believer to embrace DT mindset WDT this temporary NN is not our home . Do n't VB too comfortable down here . Brother Lester Roloff ( 1914 - 1982 ) preached a wonderful sermon titled : “ Do n't VB Adjusted , ” in which sermon he makes DT truthful statement : “ PRP LOSE OUT WHEN PRP VBP ADJUSTED DOWN HERE ! ” I hate this wicked NN ! I am so sick and tired of DT sin , DT filth , and DT ungodly transgendered homosexual agenda WDT is as a NN upon society today , sick of PRP all !!! Even so , come , Lord Jesus !!! Heaven is our home where PRP will ultimately settle ( John 14:1 - 3 ) . DT heathen NN places all emphasis on this earthly life , living for DT moment with no thought of facing DT Eternal God someday . As believers , PRP are commanded to — “ Set your affection on things above , not on things on DT NN . For ye are dead , and your life is hid with Christ in God ” ( Colossians 3:2-3 ) . Oh , how Christians fail to follow DT Lord 's instruction in DT Scriptures ! When believers fret and worry and complain and focus on making money , “ PRP are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruit to perfection ” ( Luke 8:14 ) . Carnal believers are n't soulwinners ! All PRP hear about nowadays is IN everyone should accept and respect DT rights of homosexuals . DT heart of DT matter is God . What does God VB ? What does God say in His Holy Word ? PRP 've got DT righteous speaking out against DT evils of homosexuality , as DT Bible tells PRP to do . Ephesians 5:10 - 12 , “ Proving what is acceptable unto DT Lord . And have no fellowship with DT unfruitful works of darkness , but rather reprove them . For PRP is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret . ” A man sodomizing another man 's anus is a work of darkness ! I am grossed out and sickened when I hear pastors of churches legitimizing DT LGBTQ community , such as did Southern Baptist Convention NN J.D. Greear . Proverbs 29:27 , “ An unjust man is an abomination to DT just : and he WDT is upright in DT way is abomination to DT wicked . ” Kindly , I heard Tim Cook , DT present CEO of Apple computer say publicly : “ Being gay is God 's greatest gift to me . ” God calls Tim Cook a liar ! Proverbs 28:9 , “ He WDT turneth away his ear from hearing DT law , even his prayer shall be abomination . ” Leviticus 20:13 , “ If a man RB lie with mankind , as he lieth with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination : PRP shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them . ” PRP are living in extremely wicked times , in which ungodly reprobates are elevating their own ungodly human lusts over DT inspired Words of God . DT is so wrong ! Judges 21:25 , “ In those days EX was no king in Israel : every man did DT which was right in his own eyes . ” DT U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1973 IN a human being in a mother 's womb is not yet a life , so PRP can be killed . God calls PRP murder ( Exodus 20:13 ) . ABORTION : HANDS DT SHED INNOCENT BLOOD !!! PRP is hard to even imagine how a society MD ever become so ungodly , uncaring , indifferent , calloused and far from God , IN their leaders MD justify murdering human life . And now in JJ NNS infanticide is legal , where a child is murdered while being delivered , and in Illinois , after leaving DT womb . Ungodly NN Of Illinois Declares Open Season On NNS : Removes All Bans On Abortions ! 2nd Timothy 3:12 , “ Yea , and all WDT will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution . ” I am VBG to quote a rather lengthy passage from 1st Peter , to help PRP see DT full context of what DT apostle Peter is teaching PRP . DT Bible teaches IN when a Christian separates from their old life of sin , and from their old worldly acquaintances , PRP will VB PRP strange , criticizing PRP and persecuting PRP in JJ NNS . ... DT Bible admonishes Christians not to be surprised IN worldly NNS hate PRP , persecute PRP and separate from PRP over our faith and stand for Christ . Jesus VBD in John 15:19 IN if PRP were of DT NN , PRP MD receive PRP ; but because PRP are not of DT NN , PRP are followers of Christ our Savior , DT NN hates PRP . John 7:7 says PRP really hate Jesus , and IN PRP see Christ in PRP . DT NN hates Jesus Christ !!! In Everything Gives Thanks ! Jesus miraculously healed ten men afflicted with DT horrible incurable NN of leprosy . Today EX is a cure for leprosy , since DT 1940's , but in Bible times EX was n't and PRP was a much feared NN . Unbelievably , only CD man had enough gratitude to come back to thank DT Lord . Luke 17:17 , “ And Jesus answering VBD , Were EX not ten cleansed ? but where are DT nine ? ” EX are 86,400 seconds in each day , have PRP thanked God even once today for His abundant blessings ? PRP ought to thank God continually for our food , comforts , family , salvation , DT Holy Bible and manifold gifts WDT most NNS take for granted . James 1:17 , “ Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and cometh down from DT Father of lights , with whom is no variableness , neither shadow of turning . ” Every good thing in your life comes from God , whether PRP acknowledge DT fact or not . And RB , within God 's permissive will , everything bad WDT happens in our lives is allowed by God , which is a difficult truth to embrace . PRP live in a fallen NN because of sin , beginning with Adam ( Romans 5:12 ) . When Adam chose to sin , he opened DT floodgate of sin and death upon DT NN . This is why bad things happen to good NNS , and good things happen to bad NNS , and life is not fair ! Christians ought to be mindful of our blessings , especially in America where PRP have been blessed beyond all expectations compared to most of DT impoverished NN . Just DT privilege and opportunity to VB out to eat , in a fancy restaurants IN Chilies or Burger King ( DT 's fine dining to me ) , is something WDT most NNS living in DT NN cannot enjoy . PRP take so much for granted in America . PRP are so spoiled . PRP is a crying shame and DT epitome of utter ingratitude — IN amidst all these incredible blessings , liberty and modern comforts from God — IN Americans are sinfully steeped into sexual immorality , 60 million NNS murdered by abortion , homosexuals marriages and all manner of filth , evil and wickedness !!! God deserves so much better , but Americans treat Him IN garbage ! PRP really do as a NN ! How do PRP VB God feels IN PRP have allowed our NN to remove and ban DT Holy Bible from NNS 's lives ? Honestly , so PRP have any idea how detrimental WDT has been to our nation ? DT Bible is DT Sacred Book , DT only Book in existence WDT teaches mankind to LOVE , yet hateful and ungodly reprobates have used stupid excuses to rid NNS of DT only chance PRP have of growing up to become a loving human being ! I suffer in constant chronic neck pain . My wife divorced me against my will in 2006 , and I have lived alone ever since in DT Lord ( 1st Corinthians 7:27 ) . I have forgiven her completely , but as Dr. Jack Hyles wisely VBD : Divorce is a sin WDT perpetuates for a lifetime . I lost well over $ 100,000 as a result of DT divorce . I lost my home after DT divorce and have rented since . I lost my retirement . I lost my pets . I lost most of my possessions . I MD VB on and on for hours describing all DT pain , loss , suffering and heartache in my life over DT past 20 NNS . Pastor John K. Jenkins Sr. exposes DT evils of divorce in his excellent sermon titled : DT Devastating Demon WDT Destroys Families . I am as much a sinner as my former wife , so I do not point fingers . EX are no perfect marriages . God says when PRP marry someone , PRP become CD with them , so as far as I 'm concerned her sins throughout our marriage were my sins too . PRP HAVE SINNED ! Albeit , despite my misery , problems , pain and broken heart , I have DT joy of DT Lord in my soul . I have peace IN a river . Isaiah 26:3 , “ Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee : because he trusteth in thee . ” I love DT Bible verse ! DT is a solemn promise from our great God . DT Lord promises perfect peace to DT believer whose mind dwells and remains upon God. Psalms 1:1 - 2 , “ Blessed is DT man WDT walketh not in DT counsel of DT ungodly , nor standeth in DT way of sinners , nor sitteth in DT seat of DT scornful . But his delight is in DT law of DT LORD ; and in his law doth he meditate day and night . ” DT Bible says DT reason why PRP have perfect peace is because PRP trust DT Lord . Perfect peace comes from trusting God in everything ! I choose to love , forgive , help , work and pray in DT Lord , instead of worry , complain , hate harbor bitterness and place God on trial . I am VBG to continue to trust DT Lord , though He slay me . Job 13:15 , “ Though he slay me , yet will I trust in him : but I will maintain mine own ways before him . ” I am VBG to love everybody . I choose to forgive everyone even before PRP ask . I am trying by God 's grace to help as JJ NNS as I can . I labor night and day for DT Lord . I pray because Jesus VBD without Him PRP can do nothing ( John 15:5 ) . I need God 's help in everything I do . Galatians 2:20 , “ I am crucified with Christ : nevertheless I live ; yet not I , but Christ liveth in me : and DT life which I now live in DT flesh I live by DT faith of DT Son of God , who loved me , and gave himself for me . ” Everywhere I VBP today , I meet NNS who have contempt for Christians , churches and DT Holy Bible , but PRP claim to love God . PRP are deceived . Nobody loves God who despises DT King James Bible ! Although JJ churches are corrupt , DT CHURCH has never been ( nor ever MD be ) corrupted . Likewise , DT INCORRUPTIBLE WORDS OF GOD cannot be corrupted ( 1st Peter 1:23 ) . DT corrupted modern Bible versions are NOT God 's inspired Words . PRP can VB DT truth of God into a lie all PRP VBP ( Romans 1:25 ) , but PRP cannot VB DT TRUTH ! ... Listen to me dear reader , whatever your hang up MD be — whether PRP be struggling with sin , religious scrupulosity , finding God 's will , depression or confusion — VB into DT Scriptures and PRP will grow ! 1st Timothy 4:13 - 15 , “ Till I come , give attendance to reading , to exhortation , to doctrine . Neglect not DT gift WDT is in thee , which was given thee by prophecy , with DT laying on of DT hands of DT presbytery . Meditate upon these things ; give thyself wholly to them ; IN thy profiting MD appear to all . ” When somebody tells me IN PRP are struggling with sin , I always point them toward DT Holy Bible . Psalms 119:9 , “ Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way ? by taking heed thereto according to thy word . ” PRP cannot heed God 's Word if PRP are not familiar with DT contents of God 's Word . SEARCH DT SCRIPTURES !!! PRP was 23rd U.S. NNP Benjamin Harris ( 1833 -1901 ) who wisely VBD : Dear friend , DT Holy Bible Has Always Been DT Answer . MD to God IN PRP still had DT kind of wisdom today in leadership . I have been watching DT Forensic Files , and in nearly every case of a person being convicted of First Degree Murder , DT NN refuses to use capital punishment . DT is DT sordid wisdom of this foolish and ungodly NN . I am 100 % for capital punishment , because DT is God 's wisdom . Please read : “ DT CASE FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT : HOW PRP SAVED MY LIFE ” ( a needful doctrinally sound book by Dr. Max D. Younce ) . DT foolish NN never comes to their senses ! 2nd Timothy 3:7 , “ Ever learning , and never able to come to DT knowledge of DT truth . ” DT newsmedia reports DT problem . Career professionals VBP DT problem . Talk shows exploit DT problem . NN legislates DT problem . Police control DT problem . HUMANITY IS DT PROBLEM ! I thank God for His precious inspired Word in DT King James Bible , which is our Lamp . Psalms : 119:105 , “ Thy word is a lamp unto my feet , and a light unto my path . ” Humanity is DT problem , because of our inherent sinful nature . DT answer is DT ' GOOD NN ' ( GOSPEL ) of DT Lord Jesus Christ crucified on DT cross for our sins , buried and bodily resurrected DT third day for our justification ! John 6:47 , “ Verily , verily , I say unto PRP , He WDT believeth on me hath everlasting life . ” How Permanent Is Your Salvation ? Mark 1:15 : “... repent ye , and believe DT gospel . ” “ DT mark of DT child of God is IN he loves everybody ! ” And Jesus answering saith unto them , Have faith in God . Ye Must Be Born Again ! | PRP Need HIS Righteousness !"

DT tax is designed to reduce DT output of greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide , a colorless and odorless incombustible gas , into DT atmosphere . DT tax is imposed with DT goal of environmental protection . A tax designed to mitigate or remove DT negative externalities of carbon emission , a carbon tax is a type of Pigovian tax . Carbon is found in every kind of hydrocarbon fuel ( including coal , petroleum , and natural gas ) and is released as DT harmful toxin carbon dioxide ( CO ) when this kind of fuel is burned . CO is DT compound primarily responsible for DT "" greenhouse "" effect of trapping heat within DT NNP 's atmosphere , and is , therefore , CD of DT primary causes of JJ NN . A carbon tax is RB referred to as a form of carbon pricing on greenhouse gas NNS where a fixed price is set by DT NN for carbon NNS in certain sectors . DT price is passed through from businesses to consumers . By increasing DT cost of greenhouse NNS , governments hope to curb consumption , reduce DT demand for fossil fuels , and push more companies toward creating environmentally - friendly substitutes . A carbon tax is a way for a NN to exert some control over carbon NNS without resorting to DT levers of a command economy , by which DT NN MD control DT means of production and manually halt carbon NNS . Any carbon found in manufactured products IN plastics WDT is not burned is not taxed . DT same applies to any CO WDT is permanently isolated from production and is not released into DT atmosphere . But DT tax is paid during DT upstream process , or when DT fuel or gas is extracted from DT NNP . Producers can then pass on DT tax to DT market by as much as PRP can . This , in turn , gives consumers a chance to reduce their own carbon footprints . Carbon taxes have been implemented in a number of NNS around DT NN . PRP take several different forms , but most amount to a straightforward rate of taxation per ton of hydrocarbon fuel used . DT first country to implement a carbon tax was Finland , in 1990 . DT levy currently stands at $ 24.39 dollars per ton of carbon . DT Finns were quickly followed by other Nordic NNS — Sweden and Norway both implemented their own carbon taxes in 1991 . Starting at a rate of $ 51 per ton of CO used in gasoline ( DT tax MD later decrease considerably ) , DT Norwegian tax is among DT most stringent in DT NN . Most forms of carbon taxation have been deployed successfully , but Australia 's failed attempt from 2012 - 2014 stands in stark contrast . DT minority Green party was able to broker DT carbon tax during a period of political stagnation in 2011 , but DT tax never garnered DT support of either of DT main parties in Australia , DT left - leaning Labor Party ( which reluctantly agreed to DT tax to form a NN with DT Greens ) and DT center - right Liberals , whose leader Tony Abbott spearheaded DT 2014 repeal . IN most JJ initiatives to combat NN NN , carbon taxes remain highly controversial ."

DT Mille Fleurs home near Victoria , British Columbia , MD have cost more than £ 100,000 to rent . DT idyllic bolthole has stunning views and boasts eight bedrooms and two private beaches . CD local , who did not wish to be named , told DT Sun : “ I was very surprised to hear PRP were staying RB because PRP ’s always been a mystery about who actually owns PRP . "" PRP does n’t seem DT sort of place a royal couple MD VB . ” DT mystery over DT property ’s ownership is likely to raise concerns over DT couple ’s acquaintances as PRP seek “ financial independence ” . An estate agent who helped sell PRP in 2014 VBD DT JJ owner included a non-disclosure agreement as part of DT deal . He VBD DT buyer was neither Canadian nor American . DT complex purchasing method can help NNS hide their involvement . All of DT 27 properties on DT road are registered under a company called Towner Bay Country Club . PRP means buyers effectively just purchase shares in DT club , with their names not on any JJ paperwork . Mr Milner made a fortune when his investment firm DST NNP bought stakes in Facebook and Twitter with funding VBN to be from Kremlin - controlled companies . He has RB invested in a real estate venture co-owned by Donald NNP ’s son- in - law , Jared Kushner . When asked about Mille Fleurs , Mr Milner 's spokesman Paddy Harverson told DT Mail : "" Neither Yuri Milner nor any family member nor any entity affiliated with him or his family owns this property . "" He rented DT property five NNS ago for a brief period of NN . "" Harry and Meghan missed DT traditional royal Christmas with DT Queen"

Zhengyu Liu , professor of atmospheric and ocean sciences at DT University of Wisconsin , explains : “ Data from observation suggests IN DT NNP is cooling while DT physical data suggests DT complete opposite . ” Liu has been working with professors from JJ other academias to understand DT obvious cooling of DT NN : DT issue has been termed DT Holocene Temperature Conundrum ( HTC ) which is explained : “ A recent temperature reconstruction of JJ annual temperature shows Early Holocene warmth followed by a cooling trend through DT Middle to Late Holocene [ Marcott SA , et al. , 2013 , NNP 339( 6124):1198 –1201 ] . “ This JJ cooling is puzzling because PRP is opposite from DT expected and simulated JJ NN trend due to DT retreating NN sheets and rising atmospheric greenhouse gases . “ Our critical reexamination of this contradiction between DT reconstructed cooling and DT simulated NN points to potentially significant biases in both DT seasonality of DT proxy reconstruction and DT NN sensitivity of current NN models . ” “ Over DT last 10,000 NNS , Liu says , PRP VBP atmospheric carbon dioxide rose by 20 parts per million before DT 20th century , and DT massive NN sheet of DT Last Glacial Maximum has been retreating . “ These physical changes suggest IN , globally , DT annual mean JJ temperature should have continued to warm , even as regions of DT NN experienced cooling , such as during DT Little NNP Age in Europe between DT 16th and 19th centuries . ” DT myth perpetuated by alarmist NNS is IN EX is a 97 % consensus IN man-made NN NN is real and IN DT NNP is heating up . However , John Cook , NN scientist for DT UQ NNP NNP Institute ( GCI ) , released data from DT University of Queensland ( UQ ) WDT shows “ IN DT number of papers rejecting DT consensus on [ anthropogenic JJ NN ] is a vanishingly small proportion of DT published research . ” Alastair McEwan , acting pro-vice - chancellor of UQ defended DT college ’s claim IN EX is a scientific consensus , independently of Cook ’s findings : To discredit Cook , a NN was released in 2013 by climatologists WDT claimed Cook “ misrepresented DT views of most consensus NNS . ” This shows IN DT consensus WDT humans are DT sole cause of NN NN is actually only 0.3 % .

Tonsils are lumps of tissue on both sides of DT back of DT throat WDT help DT immune system protect DT body from infections . But sometimes infections are too much for DT tonsils to handle , and these fighters of infection become infected themselves . Infected tonsils VBP swollen and red , and have a yellow or white coating . A person with tonsillitis MD have a sore throat , fever , swollen glands in DT neck , and trouble swallowing . What Are DT Signs & Symptoms of Tonsillitis ? Inflamed tonsils look red and swollen , and MD be covered with a yellow or whitish coating or spots . Someone with tonsillitis MD have : • a sore throat , which can be mild to severe • white spots or pus on DT tonsils If PRP have symptoms of tonsillitis , call your doctor . Tonsillitis is usually caused by a Bacteria RB can cause PRP , most commonly group A streptococcus ( strep throat ) . Rarely , tonsillitis can be caused by something other than an infection . Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and examine your throat and neck . Your doctor MD use a soft cotton swab to gently collect a sample from your tonsils and DT back of your throat for testing . PRP 's important for your doctor to VB if are causing DT infection . If PRP have strep throat , PRP 'll need treatment withto kill DT bacteria . This will help PRP feel better and prevent other problems WDT can come from untreated strep throat . If your doctor prescribes antibiotics , be sure to follow DT directions carefully . Finish taking all DT medicine even if your symptoms VBP away and PRP feel better , or DT infection MD come back . If a strep test comes back negative , PRP 's probably a NN causing DT tonsillitis and antibiotics wo n't help . Just UH with a cold ( RB caused by a NN ) , PRP 'll have to take PRP easy for several days and let DT NN run its course . Rarely , if someone gets tonsillitis a lot , DT doctor or an otolaryngologist ( pronounced : oh - toe - lar - un - GA - luh - jist , a doctor who specializes in ear , nose , and throat problems ) MD recommend a tonsillectomy ( pronounced : tahn - suh - LEK - tuh - mee ) . This is a surgery to remove DT tonsils . Tonsillectomy used to be a common procedure , but now experts recommend watching and waiting because large tonsils often shrink on their own over NN . How Can I Feel Better ? VB plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids . PRP can take acetaminophen or ibuprofen to relieve any pain or discomfort . ( Do n't take aspirin or other products WDT contain aspirin , though , because these MD put PRP at risk of developing Reye syndrome , an illness WDT can have serious complications . ) Avoid smoking or anything WDT will irritate your throat . PRP 's best to drink lots of liquids . PRP MD prefer softer foods , IN applesauce , flavored gelatin , or NN cream . If PRP do n't feel IN eating , try drinking liquids WDT contain calories , such as fruit juices , milkshakes , and soups and broths . If PRP 're on antibiotics , PRP 's usually OK to return to school 24 hours after PRP start taking them if your fever is gone and PRP feel better . If PRP 're still feeling weak , tired , or achy , PRP MD be best to stay home for another day or two . Tonsillitis is contagious . This means PRP can VB PRP from someone else who has PRP . Sneezing and coughing can pass DT tonsillitis - causing NN or bacteria from CD person to DT next . To protect yourself from catching tonsillitis or to prevent passing PRP to somebody else : • Wash your hands well and often . • If someone in your household or a friend has tonsillitis , do n't use DT person 's cups , glasses , silverware , toothbrush , or other utensils . And if PRP have tonsillitis , keep your stuff separate and do n't share PRP with anyone . • Do n't kiss anyone until PRP 're completely over DT tonsillitis . • VB a JJ toothbrush after PRP feel better and are no longer contagious . When Should I Call DT Doctor ? Call your doctor right away if your condition gets worse ; for example , if PRP have a hard NN breathing or swallowing . RB talk to your doctor if your fever comes back or if PRP 're not feeling better in a couple of days ."

Once PRP VBP what kind of weather triggers asthma symptoms , try these tips to protect your child : • Watch DT forecast for pollen and mold counts plus other conditions ( extreme cold or heat ) WDT might affect your child 's asthma . • Make sure your child wears a scarf over DT mouth and nose when outside in very cold weather . • Keep windows closed at night to keep pollen and molds out . If PRP 's hot , use air conditioning , which cleans , cools , and dries DT air . • Keep your child indoors early in DT morning ( before 10 a.m. ) when pollen is at its highest . • Your child should n't mow DT lawn or rake leaves , and should be kept away from freshly cut grass and leaf piles . • Dry clothes in DT dryer ( hanging clothes or sheets to dry can allow mold or pollen to collect on them ) . • Make sure your child always has quick - relief medicine ( RB called rescue or fast - acting medicine ) on hand . Your child 's written asthma action plan should list weather triggers and ways to manage them , including any seasonal changes in medicine ."

NN NN , waning habitat will drive NN Researchers are n't clear yet about how DT novel NN began infecting NNS , but say PRP seems to have originated in bats , making PRP DT latest in a string of emerging human NN WDT spread from animals . NN and wildlife experts say PRP expect to see a rise in diseases transmitted among animals , plants and humans , and in particular , more frequent outbreaks in humans of diseases WDT come from animals . Such "" zoonotic "" diseases already make up DT majority of JJ infections in humans . But animals are n't to blame for DT increase in JJ outbreaks , according to Arizona NNP University virologist Arvind Varsani . Humans are . Varsani researches DT emergence of diseases around DT globe and he VBD two major factors likely to impact DT dynamics of NN spread are NN NN and changes in land use due to urbanization or agriculture . Both factors put animals under strain , forcing them to compete for resources in shrinking habitats and making them opportune hosts for zoonotic diseases , which more easily infect stressed animals . Shrinking suitable habitat amid urbanization and DT rapid expansion of agriculture RB cluster animals closer together with humans and domestic animals . DT allows DT viruses to jump from CD host to DT next . “ PRP stress these animals and DT means PRP ’re creating an environment for viruses to succeed , where in most NNS DT viruses MD ’ve been put to check , "" he VBD . "" And with DT , everyone is in very , very close proximity to each other , so what PRP ’ve got is CD event — and PRP only need CD event to take off — and DT next thing PRP VBP , PRP 's spilling over . ” And sometimes , DT viruses spill over into humans . According to a 2016 report from DT NNP Nations Environment Programme , around 60 percent of all infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic , as well as 75 percent of all emerging infectious diseases . Researchers RB detected an increase in DT rate of JJ , emerging infectious diseases , according to DT report . In DT case of DT novel NN , DT source is believed to be a market in Wuhan , NNP , WDT sold both dead and live animals . Arizona Game and Fish wildlife veterinarian Anne Justice - Allen VBD IN veterinarians and NN experts strongly recommend against having markets IN these , which can be densely packed , difficult to keep clean , and pose a higher risk of viruses jumping from animals into humans . She VBD DT current NN - CD outbreak is an example of how human actions to mix together animals WDT were n't normally together can cause diseases to jump into JJ hosts . "" DT more PRP increase DT interaction between NNS and animals , especially wildlife and especially livestock as well , or animals WDT are raised for food , DT more likely PRP are to see DT kind of situation crop up , "" she VBD . DT NNP - CD outbreak is an example of DT risk zoonotic diseases pose . Other well - known examples of zoonotic diseases WDT impact humans are West Nile NN , HIV , Ebola , Zika , bird NN , Middle East respiratory syndrome , or MERS , Rift Valley fever , and sudden acute respiratory syndrome , or SARS . On average , CD JJ infectious NN emerges in humans every four months , according to DT UNEP report , but not all are this severe . “ While PRP is very uncommon for diseases in animals to suddenly jump and become so transmissible between NNS as this NN did , DT more PRP do DT sort of thing , mixing animals together ... then DT more likely IN NN is VBG to be able to jump into NNS and become transmissible between NNS , "" Justice - Allen VBD . With NN NN effects such as drought , increasing temperatures and wildfires , Justice - Allen VBD animals will be forced to move to JJ areas . DT MD lead to DT same type of crowding and mixing seen in live animal markets and possibly expose animals to JJ diseases . FIGHTING NN : Using robots to speed up testing , ASU hopes to open drive - thru NN testing VBG JJ temperatures are increasing DT habitat ranges of some insects WDT transmit diseases from CD organism to another , such as mosquitoes or ticks . NN is RB lengthening DT season in which these insects can survive in some areas , leading to a boom in their population . In certain areas , these insects , RB known as NN vectors , are now able to survive NN - round where PRP were n't able to before . DT increased range and abundance of vectors MD lead to more widespread NNS of mosquito - and tick - borne diseases such as malaria , West Nile NN , dengue fever , chikungunya , Zika , and Lyme NN , according to Heidi Brown , an ASU researcher who studies vector - borne diseases . Brown is CD of DT researchers who works with DT Arizona Department of NNP Services on a Building Resilience Against NNP Effects plan , which investigates DT impacts of NN NN on human NN , projects future scenarios and suggests solutions to mitigate those effects . Arizona is CD of 16 NN grant recipients creating a BRACE plan as part of DT CDC's NNP - Ready NNPS and Cities Initiative . "" PRP have to be prepared for DT known , which is increases in DT stuff WDT PRP 're already seeing , but PRP RB have to be prepared for DT unknown , which is novel introductions , "" she VBD . In Arizona , known diseases such as West Nile NNP are likely to become a bigger concern , and MD spread into JJ areas of DT NN outside of Maricopa County , Brown VBD . "" Flagstaff does n't typically VB about or worry too much about West Nile NNP , and PRP do n't usually have a lot of NNS up RB , but EX 's evidence WDT suggests IN PRP might need to start making sure IN PRP 're watching for PRP , "" she VBD . Arizona is RB worried about other mosquito - born diseases IN chikungunya and dengue fever , which are n't currently part of Arizona 's ecosystem but MD become permanently established in DT future . Factors IN drought can RB cause vectors to cluster around NN sources alongside of animals , leading to further mixing and further possibilities for JJ diseases spread in vectors . Another bridge between humans and animal diseases is domestic animals , according to Bernard Bett , a scientist at International Livestock Research Institute . Around DT NN , Bett VBD agriculture is increasingly encroaching on wild lands , bringing humans and domestic animals closer to wild ones and disturbing DT natural ecosystem . But domestic animals have been bred in such a way IN PRP lack DT genetic diversity needed for NN resilience and can then pass DT infection on to humans . CD example is DT bird NN , which moved from wild birds into domestic poultry before being passed to humans . Demand for milk and meat "" driven mainly by fast - growing populations of urban consumers in developing NNS , "" is projected to double by 2050 , according to DT UNEP report , meaning IN DT problem is likely to VB worse as agricultural demand expands . Urbanization RB can encroach on wild lands , Varsani VBD , and DT means humans are coming into increased contact with animals — creating another potential avenue for NN transmission . Increased zoonotic NN spread MD RB have devastating effects on animals , especially those already at risk from other NN NN effects . “ PRP have a number of endangered species here in Arizona which are kind of on DT edge when PRP comes to being able to respond to JJ stressors , "" Justice - Allen VBD . CD is DT Mount Graham red squirrel , whose habitat was severely damaged by a wildfire in 2017 . While DT population seems to be recovering , Justice - Allen VBD , "" another stressor might tip them over DT edge . "" Other populations on DT brink include DT California condor , DT black - footed ferret , and Arizona 's indigenous snakes and amphibians such as frogs . Some are already being challenged by NN . Black - footed ferrets feed on prairie dogs , but DT plague , spread by fleas , can wipe out entire colonies of prairie dogs , decimating DT ferrets ' food supply . This NN is n't native to North America , currently has a small incident rate in humans and is curable in most NNS . But NNS of plague MD surge in coming NNS due to NN NN , according to Justice - Allen . "" DT dynamics of plague outbreaks is changing , or will VB , "" she VBD . "" This spring is setting PRP up for a pretty significant plague outbreak . "" Arizona 's frogs and other amphibians are battling a fungal NN called chytridiomycosis , which was first seen in Africa and interferes with DT ability of their skin to absorb moisture . These diseases , along with mosquito - and tick - borne diseases , are just a few known diseases WDT Arizona experts are monitoring . But EX 's always DT possibility for unknowns — for JJ diseases to show up unexpectedly — especially in tight living conditions . In more clustered spaces , Varsani VBD EX 's a greater chance for an animal to become infected with two different diseases at DT same NN , opening DT possibility for DT birth of chimeras , or mash - ups , of two different , related viruses . If two viruses are infecting DT same cell , when those viruses replicate , PRP can combine into a JJ hybrid NN WDT MD jump into JJ animals WDT were previously unaffected . "" PRP mix components and what PRP ’re then doing is PRP ’re allowing for these viral genomes to evolve very rapidly and adapt to a JJ host , "" he VBD . Varsani RB works to find and VB unknown viruses in remote areas , such as DT polar regions . He has traveled to Antarctica nearly every NN since he first visited about seven NNS ago , and VBD viruses he studies RB MD have been around for a while , but were only discovered recently . CD example is a circovirus WDT has only recently been noticed in penguins and WDT causes lethal feather loss . Viruses in DT polar regions are just as abundant as PRP are in other parts of DT NN , he VBD , and since DT polar regions are expected to see some of DT most dramatic changes due to NN NN , these regions and their viruses are crucial to understand for DT future . As seen with DT NN - CD outbreak , NNS for JJ diseases take NN to develop , as do tests to screen for them . Arizona and other NNS have come up with plans to deal with increased outbreaks and have vector - control measures in place , but Brown acknowledged IN PRP can be hard to prepare for JJ emerging diseases . "" PRP 's a long process to be able to come up with tests and identify JJ pathogens , especially when PRP 're not DT ones PRP 're used to looking for . ” DT Arizona Game and Fish Department monitors for JJ NN emergences by surveilling animal populations and investigating animal deaths to ensure IN DT cause of death was n't an unknown NN , according to Justice - Allen . Bett VBD NN care officials can take other measures to ensure IN EX is a structured , strong NN system in place with contingency plans for NN outbreaks and centers where patients can be isolated or receive supportive treatment . “ I wonder to what extent DT U.S. anticipated this spread . If PRP have good anticipation , DT ’s a good first line of defense , "" Bett VBD . Even with further NN of NN effects on NN , EX can be unpredicted challenges in trying to anticipate and address JJ diseases , VBD Ben Beard , DT deputy director of DT CDC ’s Division of Vector - Borne Diseases in Fort Collins , Colorado . "" While long term trends in NN NN can be modeled , specific weather events or disasters such as hurricanes , floods , or fires are very difficult to predict and MD have a big impact on NN outbreaks , "" he wrote in an email to DT Republic . To prepare and respond to future outbreaks , he VBD , a strong JJ NN framework WDT prioritizes JJ NN surveillance , NN and local preparedness , and long - term research MD be necessary . In addition to being more conscious of how NNS affect DT environment and existing ecosystems , Varsani VBD identifying and understanding DT viruses present in DT NN currently can help society better prepare to control them . This is no small feat , considering IN viruses are among DT most abundant entities on DT NN . "" Viruses are understudied , "" he VBD . “ PRP have no idea what DT next entity will be , nobody expected this outbreak to take place and it's now consumed most of DT NN in a very short period . ” Amanda Morris covers all things bioscience , which includes NN care , technology , JJ research and DT environment .

DT report details a rapidly changing Arctic environment featuring melting NN , a greener landscape , and , alarmingly , greenhouse - gas NNS on par with some large nations . DT Arctic MD be releasing upwards of 600 million tons of net carbon per NN , DT report finds , potentially putting DT region alongside Mexico , Canada , and South Korea as CD of DT NN ’s largest contributors to atmospheric CO2 . Though DT carbon emitted from such industrialized nations is DT result of burning fossil fuels , DT hundreds of millions of metric tons pumping out of DT Arctic is DT result of thawing permafrost . Permafrost being permafrost , PRP takes more than DT seasons changing for PRP to actually melt PRP . DT increasingly rapid thawing of frozen Arctic NN is DT result of NN NN , and DT NOAA ’s report card reveals IN temperatures are continuing to rise in DT NN ’s nether - regions , which are n’t as icy as PRP used to be . In August , for instance , DT average NN surface temperatures in several highlighted Arctic bodies of NN were 1 - 7 degrees Celsius warmer than DT average from 1982 - 2010 . Just as frightening : DT average land surface temperature north of 60 degrees N was DT second - warmest since 1900 . PRP ’s not just permafrost IN rising temperatures are affecting . DT report RB found : • None DT Greenland NNP Sheet is losing 267 billion metric tons of NN per NN . • None Two of DT five lowest months for North American Arctic snow cover in DT 53 NNS records have been kept occurred this summer . • None NNP NN extent this summer was tied for DT second - lowest since satellite imagery recorded coverage in 1979 . NN NN extent in DT winter was RB second - lowest , narrowly falling short of DT lowest - ever total , which occurred in …2018 . These changes are threatening indigenous Arctic communities and Arctic wildlife directly , as well as DT rest of DT NN , on a profound scale . DT deteriorating Greenland NNP Sheet is causing DT JJ NN level to rise 0.7 millimeters per NN , and Arctic carbon NNS are helping cook DT NN at a rate WDT will soon be irreversible unless dramatic steps are taken . DT need for urgent action was stressed Wednesday by teenage NN activist Greta Thunberg , who spoke to delegates at a NNP Nations NN summit in Madrid . “ Our leaders are not behaving as though PRP were in an emergency , ” VBD Thunberg , who DT same day was named NNP magazine ’s Person of NNP . “ If EX ’s a child standing in DT middle of DT road and cars are coming at full speed , PRP do n’t look away because PRP is too uncomfortable . PRP immediately run out and rescue DT child . And without DT sense of urgency , how can PRP , DT NNS , understand IN PRP are facing a real crisis . ” Some governing bodies are at least trying . DT European Commission on Wednesday revealed plans for a European Green Deal WDT MD reimagine DT continent ’s economy in accordance with DT NN crisis . Meanwhile , DT NN of DT NN ’s second - largest carbon emitter is dismantling efforts to fight DT problem and struggling to even feign concern . “ NN NN is very important to me , ” NNP NNP managed last week in London despite his penchant for slashing environmental regulations . “ I ’ve done JJ environmental impact statements over my life and I believe very strongly in very , very crystal clear , clean NN and clean air .

Use_VB this_DT form_NN to_TO ask_VB your_PRP$ question_NN :_:","DT NNP - CD lockdown has cut NN NN NNS - for now . But some governments VBP to VB further by harnessing their JJ recovery plans to boost low - carbon industries . Their slogan is "" Build Back Better "" , but can PRP succeed ? I 've just had a light bulb moment . DT feisty little wren chirping loudly in DT matted ivy outside my back door is telling PRP something important about JJ NN NN . DT 's because , intertwined with DT melodious notes of a robin , I can actually hear its song clearly . Normally , both birds are muffled by DT insistent rumble of traffic , but DT din has been all but extinguished in DT peace of lockdown . DT drop in traffic is a major contributor to DT fall in NN - NN CO2 NNS PRP 've witnessed globally . Before DT NNP - CD crisis , PRP accepted DT dominance of traffic noise as an inevitable consequence of city living . Now , PRP have sampled an alternative urban ambience . Governments currently face a stark choice : bail out polluting businesses , using DT as leverage to impose environmentally - minded reforms , or let them return to their carbon - intensive activities as an JJ quick fix . But JJ members of DT NN have little desire to return to DT NN of affairs before lockdown . In a poll , a fifth of members of DT motoring group DT AA , VBD PRP MD work more from home in future . This has implications for DT UK NN 's £ 28bn road - building programme which assumes IN traffic will rise by 1 % per NN - a conjecture WDT now looks unlikely . DT stay - at - home trend will be offset somewhat by nervous JJ transport users shunning trains for fear of infection , and by long - distance commuters who might decide IN if PRP only need to visit DT office three days a week , PRP 'll buy a home even further away . DT AA , which for NNS was seen as DT voice of motorists , has asked DT NN to VB again about its £ 28bn road expansion . Its NN , Edmund King , has suggested DT money MD be better spent on improving broadband Another likely winner from DT crisis is DT movement fighting to turn city streets over to pedestrians and cyclists . This has already happened in places IN Paris , which is rolling out 650 km of "" corona cycle - ways "" , and Milan , which has a programme to prioritise pedestrians and cyclists . DT determination to seize DT moment for environmental NN stretches further than DT transport sector . DT UK is CD of several nations looking to reboot its environmental strategy by calling in favours from private industry . After all , PRP was NN which bailed out employers when DT crunch came in March . DT catchphrase is "" Build Back Better "" . But PRP MD seem to face a direct challenge in DT shape of NNP and DT NNP . DT economies of both these superpowers have been savaged by DT effects of NN . PRP are desperate to VB back to pre-virus levels of output , so their leaders MD VB DT surest means of doing so is through tried and trusted NN NN fossil fuels . For those seeking a greener way out of DT NNP - CD slump , renewable NN will help , along with electric vehicle charging points and broadband . Frans Timmermans , vice NN of DT European Commission , is on DT same track . He is leading work on a Green Deal to make DT EU 's economy sustainable and says IN not a single Euro should be spent propping up old , dirty industries . All NNP - CD recovery investment should VB towards commerce WDT either helps reduce carbon NNS or promotes digital business , he insists . But some MEPs from parties on DT right warn IN DT pandemic will have "" far - reaching "" JJ and social consequences . PRP insist DT EU must scale back its pre-crisis NN ambitions . DT 's led some governments , IN Germany and DT UK , to offer hand - outs to polluting industries without imposing green conditions . In DT UK , DT issue is causing contortions among politicians torn between saving existing jobs and conserving DT NN . MPs from DT Liberal Democrats - thought of as CD of DT "" greenest "" UK parties - have joined other parliamentarians in demanding a conditional rescue for DT airline industry . PRP say IN if ministers do n't step in , tens of thousands of jobs will be lost . But DT firms should promise to off - set their NNS by , for example , planting trees . Off - setting is hugely contentious . Doug Parr , chief scientist at Greenpeace , argues : "" Any NN bailout should focus on workers , not DT industry itself . "" PRP should be conditional on DT industry agreeing to shrink until - if ever - low - carbon technology is available - which is n't now . "" DT begs a question : which industries should qualify for support ? Should cash VB exclusively to self - evidently green sectors IN solar power - or to dirty firms trying to clean up ? Take DT fossil fuel firms WDT pay our pension dividends by drilling for DT stuff WDT 's over - heating DT NN . DT UK's oil and gas industry warns IN 30,000 jobs MD be lost because of DT pandemic and DT current low oil price . But why MD governments support a commodity WDT 's fuelling DT NN crisis , which is judged by DT UN to be deeper than DT NNP - CD crisis ? Perhaps PRP 's not RB simple . Lord Stern , DT former Treasury chief who 's now a NN expert , told me each firm should be judged on its trajectory , not on its current NN . "" DT oil and gas industries are producing stuff PRP VBP to run down very quickly , "" he VBD . "" But PRP do see some companies - IN BP and Shell - which are declaring PRP are moving in a direction where PRP VBP to be VBG zero carbon . "" So , PRP ca n't be indiscriminate or dogmatic . PRP have to look where DT industry is VBG . "" At least UK environmentalists are dealing with firms WDT agree on DT need to tackle NN NN . In DT NNP , some fossil fuel firms have been determined to pursue NN bail - outs without strings binding them to a less polluting future . DT Democratic Party has a long - standing proposal for a "" Green NNP Deal "" to promote clean technology . But NNP Donald NNP has minimised DT importance of NN NN . He has promised to help struggling fossil fuel firms , although his efforts have not taken root in a major way . Then EX 's NNP . In 2015 , its leaders were persuaded by NNP Barack Obama to make major NN NN commitments as part of DT Paris NN agreement . Since then , NNP has suffered job losses and fuel shortages . Beijing has resorted to a quick fix for DT economy by building coal - fired power plants . DT green NN tank NNP NNP Monitor says DT number of plants NNP approved in DT first three weeks of March 2020 - equivalent to 7,960 megawatts ( MW ) - was more than DT number agreed in DT whole of 2019 ( 6,310 MW ) . • A SIMPLE GUIDE : How do I protect myself ? • AVOIDING CONTACT : DT rules on self - isolation and exercise • TESTING : Can I VB tested for NN ? DT does n't take into account NNP 's estimated $ 1 trillion investment in its "" Belt and Road "" initiative to build huge , carbon - intensive infrastructure projects across developing NNS . Unless NNP and NNP NNP VBP their spots ( or DT Democratic candidate wins DT NNP election ) , Europe 's Build Back Better campaign wo n't be enough to protect DT increasingly fragile NN , even if PRP does engineer a green recovery . And PRP have a lesson from history . Nick Robins from DT London School of Economics ( LSE ) estimates IN in DT JJ financial crisis of 2008 just 16 % of JJ stimulus plans were green - mainly because NNP invested massively in fossil fuel projects . He tells me : "" If PRP have any hope of combating NN NN , PRP must make absolutely sure PRP do PRP better this NN .

Carbon dioxide levels today are higher than at any point in at least DT past 800,000 NNS . In fact , DT last NN DT atmospheric CO amounts were this high was more than 3 million NNS ago , when temperature was 2°–3 °C ( 3.6°–5.4 °F ) higher than during DT pre-industrial era , and NN level was 15 – 25 meters ( 50 – 80 feet ) higher than today . Carbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of DT fossil fuels WDT NNS are burning for NN . Fossil fuels IN coal and oil contain carbon WDT plants pulled out of DT atmosphere through photosynthesis over DT span of JJ millions of NNS ; PRP are returning DT carbon to DT atmosphere in just a few hundred NNS . Squeeze or stretch DT graph in either direction by holding DT Shift key while PRP click and drag . DT bright red line ( source data ) shows monthly average carbon dioxide at NOAA 's Mauna Loa Observatory on Hawai'i in parts per million ( ppm ) : DT number of carbon dioxide molecules per million molecules of dry air . Over DT course of DT NN , values are higher in Northern Hemisphere winter and lower in summer . DT dark red line shows DT annual trend , calculated as a 12 - month rolling average . According to DT NN of DT NNP in 2018 report from NOAA and DT American Meteorological Society , JJ atmospheric carbon dioxide was 407.4 ± 0.1 ppm in 2018 , a JJ record high . DT is an increase of 2.5 ± 0.1 ppm from 2017 , similar to DT increase of 2.2 ± 0.1 ppm between 2016 and 2017 . In DT 1960s , DT JJ growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide was roughly 0.6 ± 0.1 ppm per NN . Over DT past decade , however , DT growth rate has been closer to 2.3 ppm per NN . DT annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over DT past 60 NNS is about 100 times faster than previous natural increases , such as those WDT occurred at DT end of DT last NN age 11,000 - 17,000 NNS ago . Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas : a gas WDT absorbs and radiates heat . Warmed by sunlight , NNP ’s land and ocean surfaces continuously radiate thermal infrared NN ( heat ) . Unlike oxygen or nitrogen ( which make up most of our atmosphere ) , greenhouse gases absorb DT heat and release PRP gradually over NN , IN bricks in a fireplace after DT fire goes out . Without this natural greenhouse effect , NNP ’s average annual temperature MD be below freezing instead of close to 60 °F . But increases in greenhouse gases have tipped DT NNP 's NN budget out of balance , trapping additional heat and raising NNP 's average temperature . Carbon dioxide is DT most important of NNP ’s long - lived greenhouse gases . PRP absorbs less heat per molecule than DT greenhouse gases methane or nitrous oxide , but PRP ’s more abundant and PRP stays in DT atmosphere much longer . And while carbon dioxide is less abundant and less powerful than NN vapor on a molecule per molecule basis , PRP absorbs wavelengths of thermal NN WDT NN vapor does not , which means PRP adds to DT greenhouse effect in a unique way . Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide are responsible for about two - thirds of DT total NN imbalance WDT is causing NNP 's temperature to rise . Another reason carbon dioxide is important in DT NNP system is IN PRP dissolves into DT ocean IN DT fizz in a can of soda . PRP reacts with NN molecules , producing carbonic acid and lowering DT ocean 's pH . Since DT start of DT Industrial Revolution , DT pH of DT ocean 's surface waters has dropped from 8.21 to 8.10 . This drop in pH is called ocean acidification . A drop of 0.1 MD not seem IN a lot , but DT pH scale is logarithmic ; a 1 - unit drop in pH means a tenfold increase in acidity . A NN of 0.1 means a roughly 30 % increase in acidity . Increasing acidity interferes with DT ability of marine life to extract calcium from DT NN to build their shells and skeletons . Natural increases in carbon dioxide concentrations have periodically warmed NNP ’s temperature during NN age cycles over DT past million NNS or more . DT warm episodes ( interglacials ) began with a small increase in sunlight due to a tiny wobble in NNP ’s axis of rotation or in DT path of its orbit around DT Sun . DT little bit of extra sunlight caused a little bit of NN . As DT oceans warmed , PRP outgassed carbon dioxide — IN a can of soda VBG flat in DT heat of a summer day . DT extra carbon dioxide in DT atmosphere amplified DT initial NN . Based on air bubbles trapped in mile - thick NN cores ( and other paleoclimate evidence ) , PRP VBP IN during DT NN age cycles of DT past million NNS or so , carbon dioxide never exceeded 300 ppm . Before DT Industrial Revolution started in DT mid-1700s , DT JJ average amount of carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm . By DT NN continuous observations began at Mauna Loa Volcanic Observatory in 1958 , JJ atmospheric carbon dioxide was already 315 ppm . On NNP 9 , 2013 , DT daily average carbon dioxide measured at Mauna Loa surpassed 400 ppm for DT first NN on record . Less than two NNS later , in 2015 , DT JJ amount went over 400 ppm for DT first NN . If JJ NN demand continues to grow and to be met mostly with fossil fuels , atmospheric carbon dioxide is projected to exceed 900 ppm by DT end of this century . Collins , M. , R. Knutti , J.

This agreement is for an exclusive JJ license to commercialise a novel NN technology from DT John Curtin School of NNP Research at ANU . Dengue Fever is DT lead indication , but DT technology MD RB facilitate DT design of NNS against a number of other infectious diseases including Murray River encephalitis and Japanese encephalitis . DT increasing incidence of mosquito - borne NN is a major NN concern worldwide as NN NN expands DT range of DT carrier mosquitoes , exposing larger human populations . DT agreement includes provision for BioDiem to sublicense DT technology . Industry standard royalties apply , but apart from a small contribution towards patent registration costs EX is no up - front outlay for BioDiem . DT agreement follows DT signing of a term sheet announced to DT ASX on 6 June 2012 . Dengue Fever is a NN caused by a mosquito - borne NN WDT affects between 50 and 100 million NNS a NN , and according to DT NNP NNP Organization DT incidence is increasing significantly . Although only a small percentage of NNS are fatal , non-fatal NNS can be extremely debilitating . Dengue Fever currently has no existing NN , and control methods currently include attempts to address mosquito populations with varying effectiveness . DT technology is complementary to DT BioDiem portfolio as well as DT company 's strategic focus on NNS and therapies for infectious diseases and related cancers . "" PRP are delighted to announce DT completion of this licensing agreement , which sees BioDiem 's commercial expertise in DT area of NNS fittingly partnered with DT exciting research developed by ANU . Our focus on infectious diseases is an excellent fit for this JJ technology which has strong potential as an asset for outlicensing "" VBD BioDiem CEO Julie Phillips . BioDiem 's current strategy for DT ANU technology includes leveraging DT company 's JJ partnering network to deliver an outlicensing partner for development of DT technology , providing an opportunity to secure a royalties stream without significant development costs on DT part of BioDiem . BioDiem is an ASX - listed company based in Melbourne with an international focus on discovering , developing and commercialising NN - class research and technology targeting cancers and infectious diseases . BioDiem 's core technologies include DT Live Attenuated Influenza NNP ( LAIV ) , DT SAVINE platform and DT BDM - I antimicrobial compound . DT LAIV influenza NN is an intranasal NN to prevent infection from seasonal and pandemic influenza . DT LAIV influenza NN can be produced using both egg - based and cell - based manufacturing methods . DT cell - based LAIV NN has completed a Phase II clinical trial in Europe . DT egg - based LAIV NN technology is licensed to DT NNP NNP Organization as part of DT NNP Pandemic Influenza Action Plan to Increase NNP Supply . DT LAIV influenza NN is marketed as Nasovac™ in India by DT Serum Institute of India , and has been licensed to NNP - based Changchun BCHT Biotechnology Co . DT LAIV NN was in - licensed from DT Institute of Experimental Medicine in St Petersburg , Russia where PRP has been used for over a decade in JJ millions of NNS - NNS , adults and DT elderly . DT LAIV is administered by nasal spray and induces a rapid immune response in DT mucosal lining of DT nose and pharynx . DT LAIV is RB being developed as a viral vector for making novel non-influenza NNS for different diseases including cancers . Viruses have DT ability to generate proteins prolifically and can be programmed to produce NN - specific proteins . As part of a NN , NN - specific proteins can help generate a beneficial immune response . SAVINE ( patented Scrambled Antigen NNP ) is a platform technology for DT design of antigens for incorporation into NNS targeting an immune response to a range of different diseases . SAVINE antigens are encoded as synthetic genes which , together with a delivery technology such as BioDiem 's LAIV - based NN vector technology , can be used to develop novel NNS . BDM - I is a synthetic compound targeted at DT treatment of serious human infections . BDM - I is in DT preclinical stage with outlicensing as DT intended outcome . BDM - I is active against a range of pathogenic micro-organisms including gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria , fungi and protozoa . Key patents have been filed around BDM - I 's antimicrobial activity , including for activity against Plasmodium falciparum , responsible for causing DT most commonly severe form of malaria , and Trichomonas vaginalis , DT protozoan responsible for causing a common sexually transmitted NN named trichomoniasis . BioDiem is RB developing BDM-E , a tetra peptide synthetic compound , as a treatment for ophthalmic disorders . DT NNP Food & Drug Administration ( USFDA ) has granted Orphan Drug designation to BDM-E for DT treatment of retinitis pigmentosa , a serious degenerative NN of DT retina . BioDiem 's research is ongoing in partnership with internationally recognised laboratories . For additional information , please visit www.biodiem.com"

DT average JJ temperature has increased by 1 °C since DT start of DT Industrial Revolution , DT 600 - page report says — adding IN DT last 115 NNS comprise “ DT warmest period in DT history of modern civilization ” . DT analysis warns IN temperatures MD increase another 4°C by DT end of DT century , with dramatic consequences for humans and natural ecosystems . DT findings are at odds with DT policies of NNP NNP Donald NNP , who has questioned well - established tenets of NN NN and vowed to protect and promote DT NNP fossil - fuel industry . NNP 's stances led JJ NNS to worry IN his administration MD try to block or tamper with DT NN - NN assessment , but several NNS who helped to write DT document reported no problems . “ PRP were n’t interfered with , and PRP ended up producing something WDT I VBP is of tremendous value , ” says David Fahey , an atmospheric scientist with DT National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder , Colorado , and a coordinating lead author of DT analysis . DT NN - NN report is DT first volume of DT fourth National NNP Assessment , a legally mandated analysis of DT causes and impacts of JJ NN WDT is due in 2018 . DT other two parts of DT forthcoming assessment were released today in draft form , for JJ comment . CD analysis focuses on how NN NN is affecting life in DT NNP NNPS , from crop yields to property damage from extreme weather . DT other summarizes DT latest findings on DT JJ carbon cycle . Both of those documents will undergo a formal review by DT NNP National Academy of Sciences . “ DT NN speaks for itself , ” says Don Wuebbles , a a NN scientist at DT University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign and co-chair of DT NN - NN report . “ PRP ’s hard to counteract DT basic observations and DT truth of DT NN with any kind of political playing around . ” DT trio of documents paints a dramatic picture of how JJ NN is affecting NNS and communities across DT NNP NNPS . Tidal flooding is accelerating in more than 25 coastal cities along DT Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico . Large forest fires have become more frequent in DT western part of DT country , while warmer spring temperatures and shrinking mountain snowpack are combining to reduce DT amount of NN available to DT region 's cities and farms . As a result , DT draft NN - impacts report warns , “ chronic , long - duration hydrological drought is increasingly possible before DT end of DT century ” . DT report comes just days before DT latest NNP Nations NN talks kick off in Bonn , Germany . PRP will RB be DT first major summit since NNP vowed to pull DT NNP NNPS out of DT 2015 Paris NN pact . Few observers expect NNP NN 's latest set of NN - NN analyses to affect how DT NNP administation approaches NN and environmental issues . In August , DT NNP National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration disbanded an advisory committee WDT was intended to help DT nation prepare for a warmer NN , by translating DT findings of DT coming NN assessment into guidance for cities , NNS and industry . Nor is PRP clear whether senior NNP administration officials will accept DT reports ' core scientific conclusions . As recently as March , NNP Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt VBD he did not believe IN carbon dioxide is major driver of JJ NN . Nonetheless , JJ NNS and environmentalists lauded DT JJ reports for bolstering DT case for more - aggressive action against NN NN . “ DT full assessment , when PRP gets published , is VBG to show IN EX are palpable impacts WDT are VBG to hit every part of DT country , ” says Andrew Light , a senior fellow at DT NNP Resources Institute , an environmental NN - tank in Washington DC . “ PRP ’s DT responsibility of leaders to take note of DT and act accordingly . ”"

He was RB DT eldest son of NNP John Adams , DT second U.S. NN . John Quincy Adams was DT eldest son of NNP John Adams and DT sixth NN of DT NNP NNPS . In his pre-presidential NNS , Adams was CD of America 's greatest diplomats ( formulating , among other things , what became DT Monroe Doctrine ) ; in his post - presidential NNS , he conducted a consistent and often dramatic fight against DT expansion of slavery . Though full of promise , his presidential NNS were difficult . He died in 1848 in Washington , D.C . Though he was CD of few Americans to be so prepared to serve as NN of DT NNP NNPS , John Quincy Adams 's best NNS of service came before and after his NN in DT White House . Born on July 11 , 1767 , in Braintree , Massachusetts , John Quincy was DT son of John Adams , a prodigy of DT American Revolution who MD become DT second U.S. NN just before his John Quincy 's 30th birthday , and his wife , future first lady Abigail Adams . As a child , Adams witnessed firsthand DT birth of DT nation . From DT family farm , he and his mother watched DT Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775 . At age 10 , he traveled to France with his father , who was securing aid during DT Revolution . By age 14 , Adams was receiving "" on - DT - job "" training in DT diplomatic corps and VBG to school . In 1781 , he accompanied diplomat Francis Dana to Russia , serving as his secretary and translator . In 1783 , he traveled to Paris to serve as secretary to his father , negotiating DT Treaty of Paris . During this NN , Adams attended schools in Europe and became fluent in French , Dutch and German . Returning home in 1785 , he entered Harvard College and graduated in 1787 . In 1790 , Adams became a practicing attorney in Boston . As tensions mounted between Britain and France , he supported NNP George Washington 's neutrality policy of 1793 . NNP Washington appreciated young Adams 's support so much IN he appointed him U.S. minister to Holland . When his father was elected NN in 1797 , he appointed his son U.S. minister to Prussia . On DT way to his post , Adams traveled to England to wed Louisa Catherine Johnson , DT daughter of Joshua Johnson , DT first U.S. consul to Great Britain . After his father lost his bid for a second term in 1800 , he recalled his son from Prussia . In 1802 , Adams was elected to DT Massachusetts legislature , and CD NN later , he was elected DT U.S. Senate . IN his father , Adams was considered a member of DT Federalist Party , but in truth , he was never a strict party man . During his NN in DT Senate , he supported DT Louisiana Purchase and NNP Thomas Jefferson 's Embargo Act—actions WDT made him very unpopular with other Federalists . In June 1808 , Adams broke with DT Federalists , resigned from his Senate seat and became a Democratic - Republican . Adams returned to DT diplomatic corps in 1809 , when NNP James Madison appointed him DT first officially recognized minister to Russia ( Francis Dana was never officially accepted as a U.S. ambassador by DT Russian NN ) . In 1814 , Adams was recalled from Russia to serve as chief negotiator for DT U.S. NN during DT Treaty of Ghent , settling DT War of 1812 . DT following NN , Adams served as minister to England , a position his father had held 30 NNS earlier . In a post he was most suited for , Adams served as secretary of NN in NNP James Monroe 's administration from 1817 to 1825 . During this NN , he negotiated DT Adams - Onis Treaty , acquiring Florida for DT NNP NNPS . He RB helped negotiate DT Treaty of 1818 , settling DT long - standing border dispute between Britain and DT NNP NNPS over DT Oregon Country , and initiating improved relations between Great Britain and its former colonies . By age 50 , Adams had amassed a very impressive record of JJ service , but perhaps his most notable and enduring achievement was DT Monroe Doctrine . After DT Napoleonic wars had ended , several Latin American colonies of Spain rose up and declared independence . A defining moment for DT NNP NNPS , Adams crafted DT Monroe Doctrine , which stated DT NNP NNPS MD resist any European country 's efforts to thwart independence movements in Latin America ; DT doctrine , first introduced in 1823 , served to justify U.S. intervention in Latin America throughout DT late 19th and most of DT 20th centuries . By 1824 , Adams was well - positioned to be DT next NN of DT NNP NNPS . However , DT political NN had changed DT way presidents were elected at DT NN ; only DT Democratic - Republican Party was viable and five candidates emerged , each representing different sections of DT country . Running against Adams were Southerners John C. Calhoun and William Crawford , and Westerners Henry Clay and Andrew Jackson . In addition , by DT 1824 election , 18 of 24 NNS had moved to choose electors to DT Electoral College by popular vote instead of to NN legislatures . In DT Electoral College vote , no CD candidate had a clear majority and , subsequently , DT election was sent to DT House of Representatives . Clay threw his support to Adams , who was elected on DT first ballot . Adams 's victory shocked Jackson , who had won DT popular vote and fully expected to be NN . When Adams later appointed Clay secretary of NN , Jackson Democrats cried "" corrupt bargain , "" and were enraged at DT seemingly quid pro quo arrangement . Adams entered DT presidency with several debilitating political liabilities . He possessed DT temperament of his father : Aloof , stubborn and ferociously independent in his convictions . As NN , Adams failed to develop DT political relationships needed — even among members of his own party — to effect significant NN . PRP did n't help IN his political opponents were set on making him a CD - term NN . In his first NN in office , Adams proposed several far - sighted programs WDT he felt MD promote NN , as well as encourage a spirit of enterprise and invention in DT NNP NNPS ; these goals included building a network of highways and canals to link DT different sections of DT country , setting aside JJ lands for conservation , surveying DT entire U.S. coast and building astronomical observatories . Adams RB saw DT need for practical solutions to universal problems , thusly calling for DT establishment of a uniform system of weights and measures and improving DT patent system . While these MD have been admirable goals for an aspiring nation , PRP were considered overambitious and unrealistic for DT NNP NNPS in DT 1820s . Adams 's proposals were met with scorn and derision by political opponents ; critics charged IN DT NN 's policies MD enlarge DT powers and influence of DT federal NN at DT expense of DT NN and local governments , and some accused Adams of promoting programs to enhance DT elite and neglect DT common NNS . In DT midterm election of 1826 , Jacksonian opponents won majorities in both Houses of Congress . As a result , JJ of Adams 's initiatives either failed to pass legislation or were woefully underfunded . DT election of 1828 was an especially bitter and personal affair . As was DT tradition , neither candidate personally campaigned , but supporters conducted ruthless attacks on DT opposing candidates . DT campaign reached a low point when DT press accused Jackson 's wife , Rachel , of bigamy . Adams lost DT election by a decisive margin , and he left Washington without attending Jackson 's inauguration . Adams did not retire from JJ life after leaving DT presidential office . In 1830 , he ran for and won a seat in DT U.S. House of Representatives , once again distinguishing himself as a statesman of DT first order . In 1836 , Adams focused his long - standing anti-slavery sentiment on defeating a gag - rule instituted by Southerners to stifle debate . In 1841 , he argued in front of DT Supreme Court on behalf of escaped African slaves in DT famous Amistad case , and won DT release of DT captives . On February 21 , 1848 , in his last contribution to his country , Adams was on DT floor of DT House of Representatives , arguing to honor U.S. Army officers who had served in DT Mexican - American War ( he opposed DT war , but felt IN DT U.S. NN was obligated to honor its veterans ) . During DT event , Adams suddenly collapsed , suffering from a massive cerebral hemorrhage . He was taken to DT Speaker 's Room in DT Capitol Building , where he died two days later , on February 23 , 1848 ."

""_''","VB breaking NN alerts and special reports . DT NN and stories WDT matter , delivered weekday mornings . More than 100 bushfires are raging in Australia as DT continent swelters under record heat , a double whammy of extremes WDT has amplified scrutiny of what experts say is stark inaction from DT NN on NN NN . Blazes across NNP South Wales and Queensland have scorched almost 7 million acres , and Australia experienced its hottest day on record Wednesday , when DT average temperature across DT country hit 105 degrees . DT nation 's woes are unfolding as Australia faces criticism for what have been described as its inadequate NN policies , including DT role of federal officials in thwarting negotiations at a recent U.N. summit on NN NN . Richie Merzian , director of DT NN and NN program at DT Australia Institute , a Canberra - based NN tank WDT conducts JJ policy research , called DT 2019 NNP Nations Framework Convention on NNP NNP a letdown . DT summit ended Sunday in a stalemate , with NNS largely delaying major decisions on plans to cut carbon NNS until next NN 's conference . "" PRP was terribly disappointing , "" Merzian VBD . "" Australia is literally on fire right now , and PRP 's clearly linked to NN NN in terms of its severity and duration . But instead of VBG RB to rally DT NN behind DT need for greater NN action , Australia was lobbying to do as little as possible . "" Seasonal bushfires occur naturally in Australia , but hotter and drier conditions due to NN NN have increased DT frequency of fires and their severity , VBD Andy Pitman , a NN modeler at DT University of NNP South Wales in Sydney . "" EX is an uncontroversial link whereby higher carbon dioxide levels in DT atmosphere from NN NN increase bushfire risk , "" Pitman VBD . "" All other things being equal , a fire WDT occurs now will be worse than a fire WDT occurred 20 to 30 NNS ago . "" Trees play an integral role in DT NN 's carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide as PRP grow . But research has shown IN when vegetation dries out — as during hot and dry summer months — DT increased amount of carbon dioxide acts as extra fuel for wildfires . Human activities , such as burning fossil fuels , release greenhouse gases WDT trap heat and raise surface temperatures . A 2018 NN of DT NN report from DT Australian NN 's Bureau of Meteorology found IN DT country has warmed by just over 1 degree Celsius since 1910 , "" leading to an increase in DT frequency of extreme heat events . "" Those heat waves , combined with dry conditions , are dangerous ingredients for bushfires , Pitman VBD , with circumstances appearing to be particularly severe at DT moment . "" This is unprecedented , "" Pitman VBD . "" I do n't VB PRP 've ever seen bushfires at this scale before . "" Bushfires are RB problematic because PRP release carbon dioxide into DT atmosphere . Australia 's fires are estimated to have emitted 250 million tons of carbon dioxide already — nearly half of DT nation 's total yearly average NNS — according to NASA data provided to DT Guardian . Those events have renewed focus on Australia 's prime minister , Scott Morrison , who has refused to answer questions about NN NN and their link to DT fires . His conservative administration has RB faced backlash for its policies and rhetoric surrounding JJ NN . In November , Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack VBD NN NN concerns were stoked by "" raving inner-city lefties , "" adding IN EX had been fires in Australia "" since NN began . "" Pitman VBD IN while EX had been some progress made on DT NN level , DT federal NN had shown a lack of political will . "" PRP almost see PRP as a negotiating or debating point , and it's not , "" Pitman VBD . "" This is an existential risk to communities and major regions of DT NN , and if governments do n't act , then DT situation will simply deteriorate . "" Imran Ahmad , a NN scientist at Australian National University , VBD DT Morrison administration 's stance was symptomatic of Australia 's complex history of NN NN policy . "" EX is an ideological drive against NN NN by certain vested interests , "" he VBD . Australia is DT NN 's largest exporter of coal and its third - largest exporter of fossil fuels , after Russia and Saudi Arabia . Merzian , who worked as a NN negotiator for DT NN for almost a decade , VBD those JJ ties have shaped DT country 's NN policies for decades — and invite international criticism . "" PRP ca n't be DT largest exporter of coal , which is DT largest source of greenhouse gas NNS when consumed , and not take any responsibility for DT , "" Merzian VBD . In 2012 , Australia 's Labor NN introduced a carbon tax WDT helped DT country reduce greenhouse gas NNS by about 1.4 percent by DT end of its second NN . But DT policy was unpopular , and in 2014 , DT newly elected NN repealed DT tax . "" Any JJ tax is unpopular , but unfortunately , by DT NN PRP was dismantled , PRP MD see IN PRP was working , "" Merzian VBD . "" PRP was reducing NNS , but PRP just did n't have enough momentum to survive quite a strong negative campaign . "" As CD of DT NNS WDT ratified DT 2015 Paris Agreement , a JJ pact aimed at reducing greenhouse gas NNS to fight NN NN , Australia will join 187 other NNS in pledging to meet its reduction goals next NN . Pitman VBD Australia has much at stake , with fragile ecosystems , such as DT Great Barrier Reef , under severe threat from NN oceans and DT country 's bushfires . Still , he added , PRP 's difficult to be optimistic about DT country 's direction . "" DT Great Barrier Reef is a multibillion - dollar asset to Australia , and it's being sacrificed at DT altar of carbon dioxide NNS , "" he VBD . "" PRP 's really important to understand IN decisions WDT need to be made on carbon emission are politically painful , and EX is no NN more skilled at avoiding difficult political decisions than politicians .

DT following three pledges underpin DT work DT council has been doing on NN NN : • To lead by example in reducing its carbon NNS NN on NN . • To help residents , community groups and businesses to reduce their NNS and manage NN risks . • To work with partners to help raise awareness and support initiatives to reduce and mitigate DT impacts of NN NN . PRP are now developing a draft NNP NNP and Air Quality Strategy WDT PRP plan to publish for consultation later in 2020 . This will outline DT steps WDT PRP ’ll be taking to tackle DT issue and reduce our impact on DT environment . DT drive to become a carbon neutral borough by 2030 starts now and PRP have started work to set out DT steps PRP as a council can take and how PRP can work together as a borough . In December 2019 , PRP held a NN NN summit to bring together ideas with partners . View a copy of DT presentation and DT Outcomes Report . Already PRP have : • Installed solar panels on DT roof of several of our council buildings . • Improved DT NN performance of DT council ’s Deanes and Parklands buildings • Set up a group of Environment Champions to promote sustainable practices among staff . • Installed a fresh air cooling system at DT Civic Offices , as well as being environmentally - friendly , DT initiative will generate a saving of £ 9,500 per NN . • Reduced DT distances our bin trucks travel by rebalancing DT rounds , with a monthly carbon saving of 3.8 % per month . With partners , PRP have : • Adopted a transport strategy with a focus on encouraging more sustainable transport including cycling and walking . • Given out loans and grants to improve insulation and install renewable NN sources . • Supported residents to apply for NN funding for NN efficient boilers . PRP are working on our next steps looking at greener ways of delivering council services . Here are just a few of DT projects PRP are working on : • With advice from DT NNP Savings Trust PRP are exploring greater use of electric vehicles . • Updating our Local Plan to ensure tougher standards associated with NN NN and NNS . • Reviewing DT NN efficiency of our accommodation and our staff and councillors ’ travel . • Delivering 3,500 homes at Manydown using DT Garden Towns ’ principle ."

DT shocking truth , as he says , is IN chemtrails are part of a benevolent program aimed at countering JJ NN . By cooperating in secret with jet fuel manufacturers , NN agents have carefully kept DT massive chemtrail efforts completely under wraps . “ I am only revealing this program because EX is no oversight in DT scientific community , no JJ discussion , and little concern for DT side - effects which are well known only to a few privileged NNS interested in continuing DT decades - long chemtrail program in secret . ” According to Snowden , chemtrails are DT only thing keeping DT NNP from JJ NN incineration , but at what price ? Because NN NN is a threat to U.S. agriculture , PRP has been labeled a national security issue . With DT influence and cooperation of Monsanto , a secret Geo-engineering lab dubbed Muad ’Dib has been operating since DT late 1960s , and DT chemtrail program is often referred to by insiders as its “ crown jewel . ” Muad ’Dib has aimed to protect North America ’s NN at all costs – even if DT means accelerating desertification in Sub -Saharan Africa or spreading trace amounts of carcinogens over lightly populated areas . Other side effects , which NNS at DT secret Muad ’Dib Geoengineering Lab have predicted , include droughts in DT Amazon and powerful windstorms along DT East Coast . Snowden shared decisive documents with DT Internet Chronicle , but out of concern for national security , only his testimonial can be published . These documents contain references to NNS who MD surely be targeted by foreign counterintelligence , and their knowledge is vital to short - term survival of DT NNP NNPS . Snowden VBD , “ If this program were to stop , DT NNS behind PRP strongly believe IN within just CD NN DT North American NN MD spiral out of control , and crop failures MD lead to a series of devastating famines WDT MD quickly depopulate urban centers . ” Because DT program has been carried out on such a massive scale , skeptics might find Snowden ’s story unbelievable . However , Snowden explained IN DT chemtrail program has been incredibly easy to hide , especially with DT cooperation of jet fuel companies , a crucial part of DT military - industrial complex . Snowden VBD , “ DT chemicals which are released by passenger airplanes have been covertly introduced as ‘ additives , ’ supposedly to improve efficiency . Only as DT plane reaches cruising velocity does DT heat and atmospheric pressure cause a chemical reaction WDT synthesizes DT top secret carbon - trapping molecule . This process is imperfect , and JJ of DT by - products are incredibly dangerous even in trace quantities . DT most dangerous thing is IN although chemtrails are keeping DT NN of DT U.S. reasonably stable , citizens are bombarded every day with an invisible rain of carbon - laden molecules , and DT effect on NN is totally unknown . ”"

This is somewhat understandable since DT two concepts overlap a great deal . In fact , EX is a causal relationship between DT two . However , EX are some subtle and some not - so - subtle differences between JJ NN and NN NN . DT phrase JJ NN is used by NNS to mean a long - term increase in NNP ’s average air temperature . PRP can refer specifically to such NN WDT is due to DT influence of rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in DT atmosphere . NNP ’s surface gets most of its heat from DT NN associated with DT Sun ’s rays , which strike DT NN ’s surface during DT day . At night most of this NN is radiated back into space . Greenhouse gases ( such as carbon dioxide , methane , nitrous oxides , and chlorofluorocarbons [ CFCs ] ) absorb infrared radiation ( net heat NN ) emitted from NNP ’s surface and radiate PRP back to DT surface , thus contributing to DT greenhouse effect . Though DT recent rise in greenhouse gases in DT atmosphere is arguably DT main factor affecting JJ NN , other factors are involved ( such as variations in NNP ’s orbit , DT angle of DT NN ’s axis , and variations in DT Sun ’s NN output ) . Nevertheless , as higher concentrations of greenhouse gases allow NNP ’s atmosphere to hold on to greater amounts of heat WDT MD normally escape into space at night , NNP ’s average temperature rises . NN NN is a bit different . Before PRP look into what NN NN is , PRP MD be helpful to VB a bit about NN with respect to weather . Weather , which is often confused with NN , is DT set of conditions in DT atmosphere in CD location for a limited period of NN , such as throughout DT day , at night , or at any particular point during DT day . NN , on DT other hand , is DT average condition of DT atmosphere in a given location over a long period of NN , such as 30 NNS or more . Thus , NN NN is a longer - term NN in DT average condition of DT atmosphere . Human beings most certainly contribute to NN NN by adding greenhouse gases to DT atmosphere , but this is only part of DT equation . NNP ’s NN can VB over NN not only because of changes in DT atmosphere but RB because of interactions between DT atmosphere and various geologic , chemical , biological , and geographic factors . For example , regional climates ( as well as NNP ’s JJ NN ) can VB in response to a sustained period of heavy volcanic activity . Much of DT activity is related in turn to DT movement of NNP ’s tectonic plates , which drives DT continents across DT surface of DT NN . Over hundreds of thousands to millions of NNS , DT continents collide with other continents or break apart , changing DT paths of ocean currents and local winds . This affects DT transport of heat from DT tropics to DT poles . NNP ’s JJ NN has RB changed in response to drastic changes in atmospheric chemistry — notably DT rise in oxygen concentrations billions of NNS ago when plants , algae , and other forms of life capable of photosynthesis began to spread across DT NN . As DT NN continues to come to grips with how human activities influence NNP ’s NN , DT tangible effects of NN NN WDT is caused by JJ NN — such as melting glaciers and NN caps , rising NN levels , and changes in seasonal temperature and rainfall patterns — are becoming DT focus . With such disruptions becoming more and more apparent , JJ NNS are discussing them increasingly in terms of real long - term climatic changes rather than simply remarking about NNP ’s average temperature . Consequently , NN NN can RB refer to DT cause - and - effect relationship between JJ NN and NN NN . DT is , PRP can refer to a NN in DT average condition of DT atmosphere brought on by JJ NN ."

He was startled by how aware DT kids ( ages 6 - 11 ) are of DT challenges DT NN is facing and weaves their voices into DT film as an unjaded chorus of boundless potential ( “ Clean NN ! ” “ End deforestation ! ” “ Rocket boots ! ” “ National hot dog day ! ” ) . Turning to experts in various fields , Gameau learns about solar - powered microgrids , localized economies , electric self - driving cars , urban food farms , regenerative agriculture , marine permaculture , resource awareness and increased educational opportunities for girls ( perhaps DT most surprising element presented ) . Every solution is then dramatized as to how PRP might affect DT NN of a 20 - something Velvet . DT effect is inspiring and empowering . Fanciful animation , graphics and special effects , abetted by Gameau ’s down under whimsy , make DT film as entertaining as PRP is educational . Powered by unbridled optimism , Gameau defies skeptics by doing his homework and bringing receipts . Working on DT film in 2019 , Gameau had no idea what 2020 MD look IN . Strangely or not , DT massive uncertainty of DT present only reenforces DT pragmatic arguments of “ 2040 . ” DT status quo is unsustainable , and Gameau illustrates IN transformative NN is not only necessary , but possible ."

From now on she will VB to school on a bicycle , because driving her by car costs fuel , and fuel puts NNS into DT atmosphere . Of course PRP will be winter soon and then she will VB to VB by bus , but cycling through DT freezing builds resilience . Of course , she is now asking for an electric bicycle , but PRP have shown her DT devastation caused to DT areas of DT NN as a result of mining for DT extraction of Lithium and other minerals used to make batteries for electric bicycles , so she will be pedaling , or walking . Which will not harm her , or DT NN . PRP used to cycle and walk to school too . Since DT girl on TV demanded “ PRP need to VB rid of our dependency on fossil fuels ” and our daughter agreed with her , PRP have disconnected DT heat vent in her room . DT temperature is now dropping to twelve degrees in DT evening , and will drop below freezing in DT winter , PRP have promised to buy her an extra sweater , hat , tights , gloves and a blanket . For DT same reason PRP have decided IN from now on she only takes a cold shower . She will wash her clothes by hand , with a wooden washboard , because DT washing machine is simply a power consumer and since DT dryer uses natural gas , she will hang her clothes on DT clothes line to dry , just IN my parents and grandparents used to do . Speaking of clothes , DT ones WDT she currently has are all synthetic , so made from petroleum . Therefore on Monday , PRP will bring all her designer clothing to DT secondhand shop . PRP have found an eco store where DT only clothing PRP sell is made from undyed and unbleached linen and jute . RB ca n’t have clothes made on wool , because DT NNS from farting sheep are supposedly causing bad weather . PRP should n’t matter IN PRP looks good on her , or IN she is VBG to be laughed at , dressing in colorless , bland clothes and without a wireless bra , but DT is DT price she has to pay for DT benefit of DT NNP . Cotton is out of DT question , as PRP comes from distant lands and pesticides are used for PRP . Very bad for DT environment . PRP just saw on her Instagram IN she ’s pretty angry with PRP . This was not our intention . From now on , at 7 p.m. PRP will turn off DT WiFi and PRP will only switch PRP on again DT next day after dinner for two hours . In this way PRP will save on electricity , so she is not bothered by electro - stress and will be totally isolated from DT outside NN . This way , she can concentrate solely on her homework . At eleven o’clock in DT evening PRP will pull DT breaker to shut DT power off to her room , so she knows IN dark is really dark . DT will save a lot of CO2 . She will no longer be participating in winter sports to ski lodges and resorts , nor will she be VBG on anymore vacations with PRP , because our vacation destinations are practically inaccessible by bicycle . Since our daughter fully agrees with DT girl on TV IN DT CO2 NNS and footprints of her great - grandparents are to blame for ‘ killing our NN ’ , what all this simply means , is IN she RB has to live IN her great - grandparents and PRP never had a holiday , a car or even a bicycle . PRP have n’t talked about DT carbon footprint of food yet . Zero CO2 footprint means no meat , no fish and no poultry , but RB no meat substitutes WDT are based on soy ( after all , WDT grows in farmers fields , WDT use machinery to harvest DT beans , trucks to transport to DT processing plants , where more NN is used , then trucked to DT packaging / canning plants , and trucked once again to DT stores ) and RB no imported food , because DT has a negative ecological effect . And absolutely no chocolate from Africa , no coffee from South America and no tea from Asia . Only homegrown potatoes , vegetables and fruit WDT have been grown in local cold soil , because greenhouses run on boilers , piped in CO2 and artificial light . Apparently , these things are RB bad for DT NNP . PRP will teach her how to grow her own food . Bread is still possible , but butter , milk , cheese and yogurt , cottage cheese and cream come from cows and PRP emit CO2 . No more margarine and no oils will be used for DT frying pan , because DT fat is palm oil from plantations in Borneo where rain forests first grew . No NN cream in DT summer . No soft drinks and no NN drinks , as DT bubbles are CO2 . PRP will RB ban all plastic , because PRP comes from chemical factories . Everything made of steel and aluminum must RB be removed . Have PRP ever seen DT amount of NN a blast furnace consumes or an aluminum smelter ? All bad for DT NN !

Prickly acacias edge DT plot of land , protecting bone - dry soil from further erosion . Sghaier ’s father once grew olive and fruit trees — varieties WDT mostly shriveled and died under her watch . “ EX has n’t been enough rain in recent NNS , ” says DT 52 - NN - old farmer . Her tiny farm in eastern Tunisia is a bellwether for DT dramatic environmental changes already reshaping North Africa , which threaten to intensify with NN NN . Sandwiched between an encroaching Sahara and a VBG Mediterranean NNP , DT region has seen a sharp drop in rainfall over DT past half century — a trend experts say will likely intensify in DT coming decades . Indeed , over DT course of this century parts of North Africa as well as DT Middle East might become uninhabitable , according to DT German research and policy organization , DT Max Planck Institute . “ PRP ’re seeing higher temperatures and increasing NN stress , ” says Essia Guezzi , NN and NN project officer for conservation group WWF North Africa , summing up some of DT regional challenges . Meanwhile , rising NN levels threaten DT region ’s largely coastal populations , she and others note . These and other issues will come into sharp focus during next month ’s NN summit in Spain , a fellow member of DT Mediterranean region WDT is considered a NN hotspot — more vulnerable to DT effects of NN NN than other parts of DT NN . While Morocco has earned praise as a NN - NN leader , DT North African region overall needs to do much more to counter an otherwise grim future , experts say . RB hampering efforts : some NNS are buffeted by conflict and civil unrest , while fossil fuels continue to drive Algerian and Libyan economies . Trying to turn DT tide In Tunisia , fresh groundwater reserves are shrinking rapidly . Roughly two - thirds of DT land is threatened by desertification . DT effects of NN NN are likely to slow DT country ’s growth , hitting two major revenue drivers — tourism and agriculture — according to a 2018 report by DT Netherlands Foreign Ministry . While Tunisian authorities have outlined ambitious targets — including cutting NNS 41 percent by 2030 compared to 2010 levels — PRP have been slow to match words with action , critics say . Nor did DT issue figure high on candidates ’ priorities in recent legislative and presidential elections . “ PRP seems IN DT environment and DT impact of NN NN is DT last concern of JJ Tunisian politicians , ” says Hamadi Gharbi , WWF North Africa NNP and NNP project manager , who says DT country RB needs more NN financing and expertise . In DT village of Bir Salah , Sghaier is trying , at least locally , to turn DT tide . She and other area farmers began planting hardy acacia trees to help reduce erosion , along with moringa , a fast - growing plant prized for its nutritional and medicinal properties . DT idea was to help fight NN NN and earn a profit doing so . DT reality has not been so easy . “ Everyone likes JJ products , ” Sghaier says , showing a visitor her storeroom packed with moringa oils and powders , along with bags of moringa - based bsissa , a Tunisian breakfast drink , which a group of growers have made and packaged . “ DT problem is selling them , ” she says . “ PRP ’s hard to find a market . ” Across DT Sahara , DT African Union has spearheaded an ambitious ‘ Great Green Wall ’ initiative aimed to restore degraded land across a swathe of DT Sahel , while RB offering income - generating opportunities for communities living RB . “ DT goal is to replant trees , to return DT Sahel to what PRP was about 60 NNS ago , when EX was a lot more forest cover , ” says anthropologist Gilles Boetsch , director of a French scientific team working with Senegalese researchers in DT region . EX are plenty of setbacks he says . JJ trees die and need to be replaced , while conflict in some Sahel NNS makes areas inaccessible . “ PRP does n’t work 100 percent , but PRP works , ” Boetsch says , adding a similar regional initiative MD RB work north of DT Sahara . “ DT first problem is NN . DT second is getting communities to accept DT projects . ” In North Africa , some national projects to fight NN NN are making a difference , and Tunisia will reportedly present a regional oases protection project at DT Madrid NN conference . Local farmers in northern Algeria are getting Mexican expertise to plant prickly pear , a cactus WDT offers a raft of nutritional and money - generating benefits and needs little rainfall . Algeria is RB trying to revive a massive ‘ Green Dam ’ reforestation project WDT previously had disappointing results . In Tunisia ’s southeastern Gabes region , Dhafer Guezguez worked with DT local NN in European Union - financed projects WDT included restoring oases and reintroduce native date palm species . DT plants are hardy and nutritious , he says , but not as sweet as popular commercial varieties . Attracting consumers will need serious marketing . “ PRP need to be showcased as a product WDT ’s rare and good for PRP , ” Guezguez says . “ DT same kind of effort PRP saw in Europe and DT NNP NNPS to VB NNS to eat organic products . ” DT oases preservation initiatives have helped to boost local economies and restore depleted soil , he says . Women dominate DT workforce . DT projects have continued even after EU financing ended . Participants are RB making tourist handicrafts IN palm leaf bags and hats , to earn extra revenue . “ I VBP this is how , little by little , PRP can save DT oases , ” Guezguez says . “ When local communities realize PRP ’s in their interest to do so ."

DT Scriptures so influenced DT Home , DT School , and DT Church of Germany WDT DT national life saw a phenomenal progress . Germany was now making terrific strides in NN , art , and culture . Then came a day when innate conceit got to work . Christianity was emasculated . Christ was rationalized to be nothing more than a good man . DT Holy Scriptures were reduced to a crazy quilt . Religion came to be built on negatives . God was dwarfed and man was deified . ' Let DT strong survive , ' became DT JJ religion . Germany was decivilized and Hitler had no trouble getting his followers to arm to DT hilt to conquer DT NN . "" Let PRP ask DT help of Almighty God in these days when men "" loose wild tongues WDT hold not God in awe , "" when EX are evils WDT MD lead our greatest graces to DT grave and leave DT NN no copy . When DT atheistic deformities of our times MD coerce PRP into substituting for Christianity 's vital bread a chunk of froth scattered by miasmatic winds - lest our country become a despised Ichabod among DT nations of NN . A Church NNP Lose Her Glory "" Thy glory hath departed "" Too bad and too sad when DT is spoken of a church about which glorious things once were spoken . ' Tis tragic , 'tis true IN of some churches such is DT epitaphic description of their decay , their inverted torch , their oil - less lamps , their turning back in DT day of battle - though armed and carrying bows . DT is grief for angels . DT is laughter for devils . DT is gloating for Satan . DT is groaning for Christ 's followers . A church can "" leave its first love "" DT church at Ephesus did - and needed to "" repent and do DT first works "" Revelation 2:4,5 . A church can VB from an army into an ecclesiastical nursery wherein DT preacher is looked upon as a head nurse who has more to do with milk bottles for sickly saints than with mighty battles against seductive Satan . Then does its glory depart . A church can VB from a church of compassionate concern into a church of callisthenic conventionality utterly devoid of devotional vitality - censorious of spiritual and far - sighted leadership , worldly , wayward , and peevishly puny . Then can Ichabod be written over its portals , its pews , its pulpit . A church can VB from a cataract of activity into a scum - covered pond of stagnation . Thus , forgetting IN "" she IN liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth , "" she hastens DT departure of her glory . A church can VB from a church of aggressive conquest into a church possessive of a slothful timidity , a passive acquiescence in small attainments , a criminal spineless in DT face of evils WDT arrogantly challenge , a careless in - difference to great stretches of DT unattained . Thus is Ichabod an appropriate adjective for its activities and aimlessness . A church can be a roller of marbles when PRP should be a remover of mountains . Thus does its spiritual muscle become flabby , its fingers fumbling , its feet halt - as DT glory departs . A church can put its headlight on DT rear and VB only of DT glory WDT was . Then and thus does its light grow dim , its voice faltering , its spiritual ambitions anemic , its worship boresomely lacking in life , its glory NN of DT past . Pathetic DT words WDT fell from DT Master 's lips . "" And as he went out of DT temple , CD of his disciples saith unto him , Master , see what manner of stones and what buildings are here ! And Jesus answering VBD unto him , Seest thou these great buildings ? EX shall not be left CD stone upon another , WDT shall not be thrown down "" Mark 13:1,2 . PRP were great buildings . PRP were magnificent stones . But to his eyes PRP were nothing more than ruins , for DT glory of DT temple 's worship and service had departed . "" But DT Lord VBD unto Samuel , Look not on his countenance , or on DT height of his stature ; because I have refused him : for DT Lord seeth not as man seeth ; for man looketh on DT outward appearance , but DT Lord looketh on DT heart "" - I Sam . 16:7 . Outwardly DT beautiful and stately temple seemed destined to "" defy DT tooth of NN . "" Inwardly PRP was hollow and empty and tottering to its fall . Write "" Ichabod "" upon PRP . Is PRP possible for a church , when God calls PRP to "" launch out into DT deep "" in DT matter of soul - winning , to become "" a drifting sepulcher manned by a frozen crew ? "" Well , when academic luster takes DT place of spiritual passion , when refrigeration is valued above conflagration , such is DT danger . I once heard Dr. Perry Webb say : "" DT atmosphere in some churches is so cold , PRP can skate down DT aisles . "" Is PRP true IN a church MD be noted for DT gorgeous architecture of its building , DT lovely music of its choir , DT stateliness of its ritual , DT fine - functioning of all its organizations , DT largeness of numbers as to its congregation , DT influence in JJ circles of business and social and educational life - and yet be , in DT eyes of Him who marks DT sparrow 's fall , as a corpse wrapped in an ornate shroud ? Of DT church at Sardis , Jesus , risen and enthroned , VBD : "" And unto DT angel of DT church in Sardis write , These things saith he WDT hath DT seven Spirits of God , and DT seven stars ; I VBP thy works , IN thou hast a name WDT thou livest , and art dead . "" - Revelation 3:1 . Somebody described another church IN unto DT church at Sardis in these words : Outwardly splendid as of old - Inwardly sparkless , void and cold - Her force and fire all spent and gone - IN DT dead moon she still shines on . R.T. Ketcham once VBD : "" Attend church , but do not attend a church which prefers NN to Scripture , reason for revelation , theories for truth , culture for conversion , benevolence for blood , goodness for grace , sociability for spirituality , play for praise , pep for prayer , profession for possession , progress for power , reformation for regeneration , good for God , speculation for salvation , jubilation for justification , feelings for faith , paralysis for peace , politics for precepts . "" To this I make additional comment saying IN a church deserves to have Ichabod written from its lowest cellar step to DT sky - touching point of its steeple which prefers DT adulation of saints to ardent anxieties concerning lost sinners as well as abhorrence of DT which is evil . Glory yields up its scepter - when DT fancies of literary notables have place along with DT facts of DT gospel , when EX is DT frivolity of DT flesh instead of DT fervor of DT spiritual in serving DT Lord - godliness in form only instead of glorying in DT cross of Christ - a groping after eternal verities - and a guessing IN only borders on godliness as to DT certainties of God 's promises instead of a guidance of others into paths of righteousness . Glory "" packs its baggage for a CD - way trip "" when in DT church NNS are noted for faultfinding instead of being notable for forgiveness - when offense is quickly taken and EX is overlordism instead of DT offering of self for lowly service - when DT making of money means more than DT mastery of money . How can DT glory of DT church be as a sunlit mountain whose position never changes when in DT church EX is playing at DT job and little praying on DT job - when peevishness and petulance predominate over praise - when EX is quarrelsomeness instead of quietness - when EX is frequent rumpus - raising and riotous revelry instead of restfulness , sinfulness instead of saintliness , selfishness instead of service , tattling instead of testimony , tampering with temptation instead of triumph over temptation . "" Thy glory hath departed "" will be written on NN and known in Heaven of DT church where EX is more yawning over watches than yearning over wanderers - where EX is mere zest and not zealousness in good works . Let PRP so live and give , so love and serve , so watch and pray , IN , if DT individual 's conduct were universalized , PRP MD never be as a hand WDT writes of a church , "" Thy glory hath departed . "" DT true glory of a church consists : "" in DT purity of its members ; in its spiritual progress ; in DT unity of its fellowship ; in DT spiritual NNS born into its household of faith ; in its self - sacrificing spirit toward others ; and in DT prayer life of DT whole group . When a church is in a healthy condition hypocrisy will be limited ; progress in purity will be constant ; strife and discord will disappear ; sympathy for DT lost will seek means for their rescue ; recruits will outnumber DT losses from backsliding , removal , and death ; private devotion will be a pleasure , family religion a joy , and JJ worship a sought delight . "" Along with this let PRP remember IN any church will undergo DT frightful processes of dishonorable self - burial where EX is a lax theology WDT advocates a mutilated Bible , a minimized sin , a deified man , a humanized Christ - substituting human opinions and speculations for DT revealed pronouncements of God concerning DT Bible , concerning DT nature of men , concerning DT terrors of sin , concerning DT deity of Christ , concerning DT meaning of Christ 's death on DT cross , concerning DT plan of salvation , concerning Hell , concerning Heaven . A Home MD Lose Its Glory Yet , glorious as DT glory of a real home is , DT glory can depart - sometimes does depart - assuredly will depart - if DT things "" down under "" Christian ideals , sordidly below Christian standards for a home - VB DT upper hand and put their oppressive heels upon DT virtues which MD weave wedding garments instead of shrouds on DT home loom . Answer these questions : Are EX not JJ homes WDT are polluted reservoirs from which muddy streams WDT carry deadly contamination flow ? Are EX not JJ homes WDT are grindstones on which DT Devil sharpens his weapons of wickedness ? DT glory of a home departs when parents walk on DT edges of mental abysses - talking nonsense . DT glory of a home will assuredly leave a home as a flower wilts under heavy frost - when parents , by neglect or omission in spiritual matters , send NNS out to NN in paper boats , as though seas did not drown , - when parents , in matters momentous as to issue in stainlessness of morals , permit NNS , in daring defiance of Christian conduct , to walk bare - footed on live coals , as though fire did not burn . Today so JJ homes die in houses . Today JJ who VBP better , living for things WDT matter least , neglecting things WDT matter most , are content with houses in which EX are no homes . In pioneer days , wolves often attacked NNS . In remote mountain districts eagles did DT same . Out West Indians attempted to destroy DT home of settlers . On battlefields vultures have eaten DT sons of women . Now vultures of evil literature attack our NNS . Now poisonous serpents are in every pathway PRP tread . Now DT jackals of sex familiarity are fed by precept and example . Now DT leaping leopards of lust ; Now DT vultures of infidelity in ministry and press ; Now barnyard morality ; Now demagogues who ravage DT land ; Now DT buzzards of liquor traffic on every corner - permitted RB by DT NNP NNPS NNP ; Now DT theory of evolution in most schools - evolution , DT antithesis of Christianity ; Now modernism choosing DT livery of Heaven to serve DT Devil in ; Now godless scholarship summoning DT Bible to appear at DT bar of human reason ; Now all these infest our land . All of which is to say IN - no explorer amid DT wilds of DT North , no adventurer amid unexplored jungles , no doctor amid deadly contagions of NN - ever had to face as JJ dangers as our NNS of today face : their morals , their spiritual welfare , their mental wealth , their soul 's salvation considered . Parental delinquency makes glory depart from a home . Are PRP unfair to say IN behind every delinquent child is a delinquent parent ? Are PRP ceasing to tell DT truth when PRP say IN behind every broken youth is a broken home ? Do PRP not speak words of truth when PRP say IN behind every broken home is a neglect of God in DT home ? When a fifteen - NN - old unmarried girl , pregnant with child , stands before DT court and VBZ IN she does not consider she has done wrong - no more than thousands of other young girls are doing - where are DT mothers ? When a fourteen - NN - old boy , apprehended for roaming DT streets of a city at early morning hours , stands before DT court with tears in his eyes and asks to be sent to DT NN school - because he knows he MD be happier RB than in his own home - where is DT father ? When young girls smoke a pack of cigarettes a day and dress so skimpily PRP attract DT attention of every goggle - eyed man and boy - do not their mothers DT same ? When boys argue over DT relative "" values "" and "" quick - stirring "" powers of advertised brands of liquor - do not their fathers drink booze and vote for legalizing PRP , forgetting IN PRP can control a powder can in a fire as easily as PRP can control booze ? Is EX not too much laxness on DT part of parents toward spiritual values ? Often NNS are allowed to stay out of Sunday School and to miss church services - to remain in almost complete ignorance of DT spiritual values . Is PRP not perilous to NNS , this easy - come , easy - VB attitude of parents ? Is not DT use of intoxicating beverages CD of DT greatest evils responsible for juvenile delinquency ? Are not NNS from homes where indiscriminate drinking is done sent out to "" play DT game "" with two strikes against them ? Do not thinking NNS believe IN youth delinquency MD be negligible if PRP were not for delinquent adults , especially delinquent parents ? Can CD pass judgment on these young NNS without indictment of ourselves for failure somewhere down DT line ? Do not boys and girls VB into trouble when too much leisure NN is theirs ? Are not city governments extremely unwise to say PRP have no money for further improvement of playgrounds while PRP allot large sums of taxpayers ' money for DT cost of punishing DT youth for committing crimes ? Is PRP not shortsightedness bordering on imbecility to pay so much for DT cost of juvenile delinquency and so little for its prevention ? "" Any law should be so framed to penalize DT delinquent parent as well as DT delinquent child . . . PRP must first give God his rightful place in DT American home ... Until DT cardinal principles of God are implanted in DT hearts of DT youth of our nation ... until EX is instilled in DT hearts of DT parents of these youth a God - JJ sense of responsibility in DT home , PRP shall continue to experience wave upon wave of crime , mounting and growing steadily day by day , until PRP reaches a magnitude beyond DT scope of DT law - enforcement agencies and DT American NNS to control . "" But if parents distinguish themselves by DT profession of truth , DT worship of God , DT practice of virtue , PRP will be sure to draw others after them ; whereas if PRP are irreligious and un-Christian , PRP are infested fountains WDT poison . Parents can no more dispense with personal piety without malicious influence on NNS than a tree can dispense with sap and bear fruit . Adam and Eve sinned ! And Cain became a murderer . Had PRP not sinned , Abel MD have lived . If a rock is a quotation from DT quarry , if a flower is a quotation from DT garden , if a tree is a quotation from DT forest , if a bird is a quotation from DT flock , if every child is a quotation of his parents - what sort do DT NNS make PRP ? Today DT situation is desperate . Character is at a premium in DT land . Criminality of all kinds is rampant . DT daily prints are filled with record of deeds almost too revolting for JJ consumption . An ever - rising wave of lawlessness is hurling its weight against DT bulwarks of DT nation . Much of this is because of godless homes - because too JJ fathers and mothers have abdicated . How parents ought to rejoice for DT opportunity of living close to God , of hearing DT motion of angel 's wings in DT patter of little NNS , and of being Christlike in DT home . Glory in a home is made secure when Christian conduct is evident . Unless PRP serve God yourselves as parents PRP will plant vines on which will grow grapes of bitterness . "" What mean ye , IN ye use this proverb concerning DT land of Israel , saying , DT fathers have eaten sour grapes , and DT NNS 's teeth are set on edge ? "" Ezekiel 18:2 Nothing is so infectious as example : "" PRP can do more good by being good than in any other way "" ( Kingsley ) . "" A father who whipped his son for swearing and swore while he whipped him , did more harm by his example than good by his correction "" ( Fuller ) . "" Noble examples stir PRP up to noble actions "" ( Burke ) . "" Live with wolves and PRP will learn to howl . "" A drinking or drunken father is a poor preacher of sobriety to sons . A proud father is a miserable recommender of humility to sons . PRP will do as PRP do rather than as PRP say . Your example will counteract all DT effect of your counsel - and all DT convictions PRP MD fix in DT mind will fall IN arrows from an impenetrable shield . PRP should therefore begin "" both to do and to teach . "" PRP should be able , in a humble measure , at least , to say to those under your care : "" Be ye followers of me , even as I RB am of Christ ... "" "" Thou therefore which teachest another , teachest thou not thyself ? Thou IN preachest a man should not steal , dost thou steal ? Thou DT sayest a man should not commit adultery , dost thou commit adultery ? Thou DT abhorrest idols , dost thou commit sacrilege ? Thou DT makest thy boast of DT law , through breaking DT law dishonourest thou God ? "" Romans 2:21 - 23 If parents suffered their NNS to VB naked , to beg their bread , to lie unattended in sickness , to perish with hunger in a ditch , PRP MD be shunned as monsters . But parents act a far more criminal and a far more infamous part by disregarding their spiritual and everlasting welfare . Doubtless Herod , after killing DT infants in Bethlehem , was viewed and shunned with horror . But he was far less cruel than some modern parents . He only destroyed DT body . "" But PRP any provide not for his own , and specially for those of his own house , be hath denied DT faith , and is worse than an infidel . "" I Timothy 5:8 . Let PRP remember and teach others to remember - lest glory depart from our dwellings - IN EX is a difference in a house and a home : IN a house is built by human hands but a home is built by human hearts , IN a house is built of visible materials but a home is built of DT invisible things of DT Spirit ; IN a house MD be destroyed , but fire and flood and earthquake and storm can not destroy a real home ; IN EX is only CD calamity can ruin a home , DT death of love ; IN DT real food of a home is not meat and bread but thoughtfulness and unselfishness . DT basis for Christianity in DT home , DT preventative of departed glory , is Jesus and DT church . Can EX be a real Christian home without union with DT church ? Can EX be Christian homes without churchgoing as a habit as well as a duty and a privilege ? Jesus had DT habit of churchgoing , for 'tis written : "" He was in DT synagogue as was his custom on DT Sabbath day . "" When I was a boy PRP was as natural to VB to church on Sunday as PRP was to work on Monday or to play games on Saturday afternoon , but DT present idea is IN PRP is a terrible thing , a species of mental and physical punishment . Dr. Macartney tells how when Grover Cleveland lay dying at Princeton , his mind reverted , not to any of DT fierce political battles through which he had passed , nor to DT presidential honors and burdens which he had borne , but to DT old home in DT Presbyterian manse , where his minister father at family worship prayed for DT eternal salvation of his NNS . DT dying man asked IN a copy of DT hymnbook out of which PRP used to sing be procured , so IN with its music and its memories he might face DT eternal NN . And then this great preacher says : "" All kinds of doctors are abroad today with all kinds of remedies for our national and social diseases . But a filled family pew in God 's house on DT Lord 's day is DT best thing WDT can ever happen to a family , a city , or a nation . "" An Individual NNP Lose DT Glory PRP is possible for an individual so to live WDT PRP can be VBN in NN and declared in Heaven : "" Thy glory has departed "" - as light departs from a lamp in which EX is no oil , as fruitfulness departs from a tree wherein is no sap . DT old poet must have had some experience of this truth when he wrote : I remember , I remember , But now 'tis little joy To VB I 'm farther off from Heaven Than when I was a boy . What tragedy when "" Ichabod "" - "" Thy glory hath departed "" - is written above and over a once - believing heart ! What sorrow sufficient to make angels weep - when "" thy - glory - hath - departed "" is DT autobiography of a life once faithful , once loyal , once devoted . What cause for grief when DT life once a life of unselfish service becomes a life of stagnant selfishness - a life WDT centers in self . What tragedy for NN and man and God when DT life once possessed of DT fruit of DT Spirit - "" love , joy , peace , longsuffering , gentleness , meekness , goodness , faith , self - control "" - is now a life in which is manifest DT works of DT flesh - "" adultery , fornication , uncleanness , lasciviousness , idolatry , witchcraft , hatred , variance , emulations , wrath , strife , seditions , heresies , envying , murders , drunkenness , reveling , and such JJ . "" Yet IN PRP see , IN PRP find , in DT lives of some individuals who have gone from PRP - and in DT lives of some who now live in our midst . So JJ who call themselves Christians have lost DT old - NN glow . With them DT sacred fervor of other NNS is lacking . Men and women RB are who once believed in prayer and believed IN PRP forfeit peace and bear needless pain because PRP do not carry everything to God in prayer ; but now PRP are prayerless altogether or are weak in prayer and look upon PRP as a useless exercise . NNS I VBP who , when PRP were young , believed DT Bible to be DT Word of God - infinite in scope , infallible in authority , regenerative in power , personal in application - who now say IN PRP is a book of myths and allegories . Of them 'tis tragically true PRP have hewn themselves cisterns where no NN is and have forsaken DT fountain of living waters . I VBP young NNS who have attended schools WDT once , in DT days of our forefathers , were bulwarks for DT most holy faith . Entering these schools PRP were believers in DT miraculous and DT supernatural , but now , deceived by DT evil seducers who wooed and won them with strange and fantastic myths , PRP are adrift - without chart or compass . From them DT glory hath departed , even as PRP had departed from schools which serve DT Devil in DT livery of Heaven . Instead of believing DT certainties of God 's Word , PRP put their trust in DT unscriptural surmises of men . Instead of feeding on God 's Word , PRP have grown lean on DT diet of quips given them by those who , calling themselves scholarly teachers , plant "" probabilities "" and "" perhapses "" and "" maybes "" or "" not - at - alls "" in DT minds of youth . Thus has glory departed from DT teachers and from DT taught . Thus has glory departed from DT schools in which these teachers teach . DT students so taught and DT teachers who , IN vandals , break into DT house of their faith should realize IN man 's wisdom is to be laughed at . How glory departs from an individual , or a multitude of individuals when PRP depart from DT teaching of DT supernaturalistic school , championed by orthodox Christians contending IN Christ is DT God-man - to line up with DT materialistic school , championed by evolutionists . VB of Judas - DT incarnation of infamy today ! Shakespeare called him "" DT base Judean who sold a pearl richer than all his tribe . "" Judas , given a great opportunity by Christ Himself , had part of "" DT ministry and apostleship on which angels longed to serve . "" Did not this position place its participant on a level with Moses and Elijah ? But DT glory of this individual began to grow dim when he began to wonder about DT course WDT Jesus chose in refusing DT kingship and in antagonizing DT rulers . DT glory grew even dimmer when he began to worry about DT future - and dimmer still when he began to pilfer DT bag . And his glory departed completely when he went out into DT night to bargain to betray Jesus for DT price of a hog ! Truly over PRP all PRP can write : "" Thy glory hath departed . "" And VB of Lot - called just and righteous . "" And delivered just Lot , vexed with DT filthy conversation of DT wicked ( for DT righteous man dwelling among them , in seeing and hearing , vexed his righteous soul from day to day , with their unlawful deeds . ) "" He was driven to Egypt when famine came , yet his soul in JJ ways became a famished soul . A businessman , an opportunist , maker of a bad choice WDT he thought was a good choice . He certainly added no brightness to manhood 's torch by marrying a woman of Sodom - DT wickedest city mentioned in man 's literature , hopelessly corrupt . Lot escaped with only his family when God burned Sodom to DT ground . Lot 's last act was CD of incest . From his daughters came DT nations of Ammon and Moab . And VB of Saul - first king of Israel . His glory , which was as a burning bush of splendor , faded into lusterless cold ashes . Let PRP see what DT Scriptures tell PRP : "" And DT Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons ; and DT Philistines slew Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Melchishua , Saul 's sons . And DT battle went sore against Saul , and DT archers hit him ; and he was sore wounded of DT archers . Then VBD Saul unto his Armour bearer , Draw thy sword , and thrust me through therewith ; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and abuse me . But his Armour bearer MD not ; for he was sore afraid . Therefore Saul took a sword , and fell upon PRP "" I Samuel 31:2 - 4 . Again and again , with tragic repetition , do DT pages of history testify IN individuals who once gave light as steady stars came to DT NN and place where their light was DT flame of a fluttering candle . In our churches PRP see NNS who once served faithfully who proved their kinship with Demas - to DT hurt of some and to DT sorrow of JJ . In some homes PRP have those who once held as sacred DT marital vow who have gone as wild as DT winds which VBP no barriers in making these vows perjury . ' Tis true IN JJ VBP not , or , if knowing , give no heed to DT truth WDT to leave Jesus out of life is to say good - by to glory . Against all things and against all evils WDT bring NNS to DT place and NN where PRP say good - by to glory , I MD IN all men MD take an unwavering stand remembering God 's promise : "" And PRP shall fight against thee ; but PRP shall not prevail against thee ; for I am with thee , saith DT Lord , to deliver thee .

MORE FROM MY NN NN DAILY : • Beyond NNS : 5 Things WDT Might Really Cause NN • 10 JJ Myths WDT Just Wo n't VB Away In a 2011 survey , about a third of parents expressed concerns IN their child received too JJ NNS before age 2 , and too JJ NNS on a single day . Previous studies have found no link between DT number of NNS a child receives and their risk of several neurological conditions ( though these studies did not specifically consider NN ) . DT JJ NN went a step further by looking at DT link between a child 's total exposure to antigens — DT proteins in NNS WDT stimulate DT body 's immune system — and his or her risk of NN . DT researchers looked at total antigen exposure rather than DT total number of NNS kids received because , at DT root of parents ' concerns is DT idea IN "" somehow PRP provide too much immunological stimulation , more so than a young child 's immune system can handle , "" VBD NN researcher Dr. Frank DeStefano , of DT Centers for NNP Control and Prevention . ( DT sheer number of NNS MD not be as good a measure of immunological response because NNS contain different numbers of antigens , and some protect against more than CD NN , DeStefano VBD . ) DeStefano and colleagues analyzed information from about 250 NNS with NN and 750 NNS without NN , born between 1994 and 1999 . NNS with NN were exposed to about same total number of antigens as NNS without NN at ages 3 months , 7 months and 2 NNS . EX was RB no difference between DT two groups in terms of DT total number of antigens PRP were exposed to on a single day . "" Parental concerns WDT their NNS are receiving too JJ NNS in DT first two NNS of life , or too JJ NNS at a single doctor visit are not supported in terms of an increased risk of NN , "" DT researchers write in DT March 29 issue of DT Journal of Pediatrics .

Although NNS today receive more NNS than NNS in DT mid-90s , DT NNS used today contain fewer antigens .

NNS 's attitudes have RB relaxed , leading some officials to worry about complacency and a second wave of infections . DT nightclub outbreak MD heighten those fears , but DT NN has already responded aggressively , tracing and testing thousands of NNS in a matter of days . Last mile is DT toughest Though testing companies were quick to respond to DT demand , rolling out DT kits presented difficulties . Through February , demand for tests was still outpacing supply , and EX were only enough kits to distribute to a select number of hospitals . Furthermore , hospitals struggled to administer DT tests to potentially contagious patients safely and quickly — testing areas needed to be sanitised after each patient , long queues meant DT NN MD spread while NNS waited in line , and NN workers were running low on protective gear . At Yangji Hospital , this RB led to exhausted staff , says hospital director Sang Il Kim . "" Even when PRP did have kits , DT waiting times were just too long for everybody to VB tested , so PRP MD have to VB to other hospitals , "" adds Yoona Chung , a doctor in DT hospital 's surgery department . According to Yangji's data , DT hospital was conducting roughly 10 tests a day by late February — but JJ more were being turned away due to DT wait . Other hospitals in Korea started experimenting with drive - through testing centres , where patients MD VB tested without leaving their cars . But Yangji Hospital is near a subway station in a crowded neighbourhood in southern Seoul ; for JJ of its patients , cars are n't an option . So , Kim devised DT walk - in booths , which went into pilot operation on March 10 . Within days , DT number of tests administered in a day had tripled .

DT cause of death was an overdose of DT painkiller Tylenol . No autopsy was performed , and EX was no suicide note .

With DT help of a task force of NNS , PRP found a flask of anthrax WDT closely matched –through its genetic markers –the anthrax used in DT attack . This flask had been in DT custody of Ivins , who had published no fewer than 44 scientific papers over three decades as a microbiologist and who was working on developing NNS against anthrax .

Some say NN NN hard to find Some parts of DT country are experiencing spot shortages of NN NN because of increased demand in a NN season WDT started earlier and is more severe than previous NNS . In Las Vegas , Celeste Tom tried six times before she found a NN shot for her boyfriend . "" I 'd been bugging him to VB a NN shot , but he kept putting PRP off , "" VBD Tom , 55 . DT Smith 's Food and Drug Center where she got her shot was out . Her partner called his doctor 's office , but PRP were out , too . Next she tried a Walgreens and then a CVS pharmacy ; no NN . She called another Smith's , but PRP MD administer NN only to NNS over 65 . On Monday , she found a Walgreens WDT had 10 doses left . "" I called back when he got off work at 1 p.m. to make sure PRP still had some , and he finally went in . "" "" DT bottom line is EX 's NN out RB , "" VBD Tom Skinner , a spokesman for DT Centers for NNP Control and Prevention . "" EX MD be places where EX are spot shortages , but EX should be a little bit more coming , so NNS MD have to check around for PRP . "" PRP took Pam Copley a full day . DT Staten Island , N.Y. , mom , 42 , tried her pediatrician , but DT office had no appointments until February . She and daughter Colleen , 15 , got in line at a CVS , only to have DT nurse come and and say she did n't have shots for anyone under 18 . After "" a bunch of phone calls , "" Copley found NN at an urgent - care clinic . PRP had to wait RB for five hours , but PRP was worth PRP , she VBD . "" EX 's lots of NN in DT schools here right now . U.S. NN NN manufacturers have increased DT number of doses PRP expect to produce this NN to 145 million from previous estimates of 137 million , Skinner VBD . About 128 million doses have been shipped , and DT "" vast majority "" of those have been used , he VBD . "" PRP had 112 million NNS vaccinated by DT end of November . "" DT CDC is working with DT National Influenza NNP Summit , a coalition WDT monitors DT NN and NN supply , to tell doctors and other NN care providers which distributors and NN manufacturers have NN available to order , Skinner VBD . "" Spot shortages are not due to any manufacturing issues , "" VBD Rita Chappelle , a spokeswoman for DT Food and Drug Administration . PRP 's more an effect of a mild NN season last NN and a more severe NN this NN . "" Demand for DT NN is high . "" Ordering NN NN can be a challenge , VBD Cameron Wolfe with DT division of infectious diseases at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham , N.C . PRP requires "" pharmacies , physicians ' offices and clinics to pre-order their supply , and given DT variability in DT NN season , PRP is always an educated estimate of what PRP 'll actually need . "" EX are two main NN producers in DT NNP NNPS , Sanofi NNP in Bridgewater , Conn. , and GlaxoSmithKline in Upper Merion , Pa . For DT 2012 - 2013 NN season GlaxoSmithKline , RB known as GSK , produced about 25 million doses of NN NN . All those 25 million doses of NN NN are spoken for , and shipping will be finished by early to mid-February , GSK spokesman Robert Perry VBD . DT does n't mean EX 's no more NN NN available to doctors . Much of GSK 's production goes to JJ suppliers WDT take orders from doctors ' offices , Perry VBD . DT company had DT capacity to produce more NN shots , but 25 million doses was "" what customers told PRP PRP MD need , "" Perry VBD . In DT past two NNS about half of Americans VBP vaccinated . PRP 's tricky to estimate how much to produce because NN NN takes six to nine months to produce , so manufacturers have to plan production before all DT orders are in . GSK began taking orders for this NN season in October 2011 . PRP will finish taking orders for next NN 's NN season next month . NN care providers base their estimates on previous NN 's demand . A single dose costs $ 7.90 to $ 8.85 wholesale , and doctors are careful not to order too much . PRP 's still not too late to VB vaccinated . NN seasons are unpredictable in their length , and PRP 's unclear whether NNS are still building or beginning to wane , according to DT CDC . "" Being vaccinated with DT NN NN each NN remains DT best way to prevent DT NN , "" Chappelle VBD . Information on NN NN availability is at www.flu.gov."

A fisherman found Bradstreet ’s body in a North Carolina river on Friday , June CD . Authorities in Rutherford County , North Carolina , VBP IN he had a gunshot wound to DT chest , “ which appears to be self - inflicted , ” according to DT local newspaper , DT Gwinnett Daily Post . DT Post RB reports IN DT speculation has spread IN a NN through DT community of NNS who are mourning DT loss of a man whom PRP viewed as a courageous crusader against mainstream medicine and who believe , as Bradstreet argued , IN DT mercury in NNS causes NN ( DT evidence emphatically indicates otherwise ) . According to his website , Bradstreet , whose own son is autistic , embraced a number of unproven or untested interventions for NN , including using stem cells in an overseas NN he chronicles , and hyperbaric oxygen therapy , which DT FDA cracked down on in 2013 . He was known for his use of chelation therapy . As I ’ve written about here before , those who are attracted to NN theories to explain their NN have a tendency to see NN all around them . With DT death of Bradstreet , this tendency is emerging in force . A related fundraiser with DT title “ Finding out DT truth ” references an “ exhaustive investigation into DT possibility of foul play . ” At last look , DT funds raised were in DT low five figures . Some seem to VB IN DT location of DT wound suggests foul play , but about a fifth of suicides by gunshot involve a wound to DT chest . A handgun RB was found in DT river where Bradstreet ’s body was discovered . Studies of NNS who are prone to subscribe to NN theories indicate IN readers drawn to NN - related online NN tend to be more focused on what filters into their narrow , NN - oriented communities , reinforcing confirmation biases and adding fuel to DT conspiratorial machine . In DT NNP , “ conspiracist beliefs , ” which are widespread , correlate with being more likely to use alternative medicine and to shun mainstream medicine , even to DT point of being less likely to have an annual physical . Researchers call DT internet a “ natural medium ” for DT diffusion of NN theories , and DT rapidity with which this NN spread and took hold is no exception ."

NNP Nixon had DT Watergate scandal . NNP Bill NNP lied about his affair with Monica Lewinsky . And , in DT first two NNS Donald NNP was NN , DT Washington Post reported he ’s made over 8,000 “ false or misleading claims ” to DT American NN . Still , PRP is rare to see a headline declaring any NN or politician a liar . Why is DT ? First of all , what does PRP mean to lie ? DT noun and verb lie are both recorded in Old English by DT 900s . To lie is “ to speak falsely or utter truth knowingly , as with intent to deceive . ” More generally , to lie is “ to express what is false , convey a false impression . ” So , when a person lies , PRP are n’t just sharing false information , PRP ’re doing PRP with DT sinister intent of getting others to believe misleading information . If someone does this habitually , then PRP MD call them a liar , “ a person who tells lies . ” This word is RB attested to in DT 900s . Why do n’t journalists use DT word liar ? DT main reason why JJ journalists avoid accusations of lying is because PRP is difficult to determine CD key word in DT definition above : intent . If a lie is “ a false statement WDT is made with deliberate intent to deceive , ” then calling someone a liar means PRP VBP PRP are intentionally trying to mislead NNS . While JJ of PRP make DT assumption about politicians , PRP ’s different when PRP ’re a member of DT NN tasked with reporting DT NN — not your own conclusions about PRP . David Greenberg , a professor of history and NN studies at Rutgers University and a contributing editor at Politico , wrote in 2017 IN DT NN declaring DT NN a liar MD cross a serious line . DT ’s not to say IN PRP should never be done . Prior to DT Watergate scandal , as Greenberg observed , a National Press Club report found Nixon guilty of “ an unprecedented , NN - wide effort to control , restrict and conceal information ” and “ discredit DT press . ” Still , PRP was n’t until DT Watergate story broke and investigations proved Nixon ’s intent IN DT NN declared DT NN a liar . If DT NN wants to retain their credibility , Greenberg argued , PRP are right to hold back from declaring NNP NNP , or anyone else , a liar . “ Though PRP MD seem fainthearted to use words IN ‘ falsehood ’ and ‘ untruth , ’ in DT long run DT press will have more influence if PRP avoids insinuating more than PRP can confidently assert to be true , ” he wrote . Should journalists use liar anyways ? On January 21 , 2019 , DT Washington Post reported IN , in DT first two NNS of his presidency alone , NNP made 8,158 false claims about DT economy , immigration , trade , foreign policy , and other matters . In just CD instance in March 2019 , NNP wrongly identified Patrick Moore , a man with early involvement in Greenpeace , as a cofounder of DT organization in a tweet about him calling NN NN “ fake NN . ” Greenpeace was quick to correct NNP on DT fact IN Moore was not a cofounder , but DT did n’t VB DT fact IN JJ NNS were exposed to DT tweet and MD have accepted DT NN ’s words as true . Since DT 2016 NNP presidential election , NNS have grown increasingly frustrated with DT NN ’s treatment of JJ figures who lie , with JJ concerned IN PRP live in a post - truth society where facts have become irrelevant . And , PRP ’s not only NNP . DT election brought PRP DT Hillary NNP email scandal , during which NNP VBD she “ never received nor sent any material WDT was marked classified ” on her private email server as Secretary of NNP — a claim IN Politifact characterized as false . During DT 2016 presidential election , Politifact RB found IN 84 percent of claims Ben Carson , now Secretary of DT Department of Housing and Urban Development , made since 2007 were false , including his assertion IN EX are a “ multitude ” of unnecessary NNS available to DT NN . Texas Senator Ted Cruz told lies about 66 percent of DT NN in DT NN frame , including IN “ DT federal NN is VBG after school districts , trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls . ” Blurring DT lines between fact and fiction even more , NNP has popularized DT term fake NN — not to call out actual fake NN but to discredit anyone or anything perceived as unflattering to him . DT strategy has been incredibly effective , and he has succeeded in creating an environment in which DT truth is difficult to discern . JJ argue IN DT NN simply can’t tolerate this level of misinformation anymore . Even journalists are starting to call CD another out . In January , Esquire published an op -ed by journalist Dan Sinker called “ In 2019 , DT NN Has to Do Better in Calling Out NNP ’s Sh*t [ edited ] . ” Sinker noted IN journalists do n’t use words IN lie and liar because PRP ’re supposed to maintain a level of objectivity . Nonetheless , he added : Of course , being objective does n’t mean letting liars lie . “ Balance ” is n’t setting two pundits up to argue over what everyone knows is a false statement . EX ’s no bias in saying something is patently untrue if PRP is , in fact , patently untrue . In fact , saying things are n’t true from jump is kinda DT most important part of DT job . Some major NN organizations have indeed been using DT word liar in content . In August 2018 , DT NNP Yorker ran DT headline “ PRP ’s True : NNP Is Lying More & He ’s Doing PRP On Purpose . ” In October , CNN published “ Donald NNP Lies And He ’s Doing A Lot More of PRP Lately . ” DT Atlantic joined DT call - out in November 2018 with a piece simply titled : “ DT NNP ’s Lies . ” In DT era of fake NN , publications have to contend with DT fact IN any escalation on their part ( i.e. , calling someone a liar ) , RB comes with an escalation in DT intense scrutiny DT NN is already facing . DT NN has DT unique ability to speak truth to power , and DT includes calling out politicians and not allowing them to VB away with lies . EX MD be disagreement on where DT liar line should be , but DT does n’t VB DT fact IN PRP need to draw CD — even if intent is tricky to determine .

A mother carries her sleeping child into DT waiting room , while a sick baby screams so loudly IN DT receptionist has difficulty making herself understood on DT phone . Over in a corner , an assistant is preparing a combined measles , mumps , rubella and chickenpox NN for DT next patient . She carefully puts a needle and a syringe on a tray together some JJ swabs , and then removes DT NN from DT fridge . PRP still needs to be drawn and diluted before being injected . DT NNP NNP Organization recommends IN all NNS have two doses of DT NN to ensure immunity from measles . "" All of my NNS have been vaccinated against measles , "" says Dr Dieter Knöbl from behind his desk . Dr Knöbl , CD of three pediatricians who work here , has been treating NNS in this surgery for 20 NNS . Before IN he spent 14 NNS on DT pediatric ward of DT Karlsruhe JJ hospital . He says he 's seen so "" JJ NNS suffering from measles and JJ from measles complications "" WDT he always advises parents to vaccinate . DT measles complications Dr Knöbl is talking about include middle ear infections , pneumonia and measles encephalitis . DT latter is an inflammation of DT brain , which can cause permanent brain damage and even death . Another complication is DT quite rare but fatal NN with DT unwieldy name of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis ( SSPE ) . With SSPE , DT NN slowly attacks DT central nervous system . "" PRP 's as if DT NNS have Alzheimer 's even though PRP are young , "" Knöbl says . "" As DT NN progresses DT infected NNS physically and mentally deteriorate . PRP can't speak , PRP are paralyzed and at DT end , PRP just lie RB and gasp for air . PRP is a wretched death . "" During his NN working at DT hospital , Dr Knöbl experienced three NNS dying of SSPE and CD of pneumonia . Measles complications are more common than JJ NNS VBP . Of DT nearly three hundred NNS who caught measles in an outbreak in Berlin in 2013 , more than a hundred ended up in hospital - DT 's a hospitalization rate of more than 30 percent . On average , CD in a thousand measles patients will develop encephalitis . In western NNS , about CD in three thousand NNS infected with measles will die ( DT figure is much higher in developing NNS , where added factors , such as malnutrition , can result in measles fatality rates of up to 30 percent ) . To make matters worse , measles is CD of DT most contagious diseases on DT NN . But JJ refuse to vaccinate Despite DT risks , EX are JJ parents who refuse to have their NNS vaccinated . Some doctor 's surgeries in Germany refuse to take on NNS who have n't had all their jabs , saying PRP 's DT only way to protect their other patients . "" DT is n't our philosophy , "" says Dr Knöbl . He and his colleagues believe IN by turning away unvaccinated NNS DT parents MD deliberately seek out doctors who share their opposition to NN . By keeping DT parents coming to his surgery , he hopes EX is a chance DT doctors can win them over . "" In our experience , DT younger DT child , DT more worried DT parents are about vaccinating , "" Dr Knöbl says . "" But if PRP accept their fears and give them a bit of NN , most of them VBP their mind . "" In 1998 , DT British JJ doctor Andrew Wakefield alleged DT MMR ( measles , mumps , rubella ) NN caused NN . Although Wakefield 's NN has since been discredited and withdrawn - and Wakefield has been struck off as a British JJ practitioner - rumors of DT link continue to abound . In addition , EX are parents who are unwilling to risk their NNS getting encephalitis , which is a rare side - effect of DT NN . At around a chance of CD - in - a - million , DT risk is considerably less than DT CD - in - a - thousand chance of developing encephalitis from measles itself . But add these fears to DT general JJ distrust of doctors , medicines and pharmaceutical companies - which is more pronounced in DT southern German NNS of Baden - Württemberg and Bavaria - together with those who simply forget to bring their child for a follow - up jab and PRP have a significant number of NNS who are n't immunized . In Germany , DT measles immunization rate is 92 percent - in Baden - Württemberg PRP 's even lower at 89 percent . This might sound IN a lot , but PRP is well below DT 95 percent goal set by Germany and other European nations to eradicate DT NN by 2015 . In 2013 , DT then German NN minister Daniel Bahr raised DT idea of mandatory NN as a way of increasing DT measles NN rate . But Dr Günter Pfaff , DT chief epidemiologist at DT Baden - Württemberg NNP NNP Authority is n't convinced IN such measures MD work in Germany . "" PRP probably MD have to use more NN to fight against opposition to mandatory NN than PRP MD use to convince NNS IN NN is good , and IN PRP MD be a benefit for their NNS , "" he says from his office in Stuttgart . For Pfaff , defeating measles in Germany is about minutely analyzing DT data . He turns around a giant whiteboard covered with a map of DT NN . PRP shows DT measles NN rate for every NN district . Some are dark blue - DT 's good because PRP means DT NN rate is more than 95 percent . Others are light blue - which is n't so good . "" PRP can see EX are a few communities , where EX is quite a stark contrast between [ them and ] neighboring communities , and EX is hardly another way of explaining this than IN DT practice of provision of JJ services varies from town to town , "" he says . CD approach DT NN NN authority ( Landesgesundheitsamt Baden - Württemberg ) is looking into is directly approaching doctors in villages and towns with low NN rates . PRP is something Dr Pfaff has tried in a few NNS . "" What PRP [ VB to do ] is ask DT doctors ' did PRP notice IN in your town vaccinations are much lower than in DT neighboring village ? And how come ? PRP MD VB to draw your attention to this and PRP MD VB to talk to PRP about PRP , ' "" he says . Another approach PRP have been using is publishing DT measles NN rates for villages and districts in community newsletters along with comparisons to neighboring places . This kind of specific , local information has been found to help more than JJ information campaigns on a national level or in mainstream , national NN . Whatever DT approach , PRP is possible to eradicate measles . DT Americas - both north and south - succeeded in 2002 . But Germany - CD of Europe 's most advanced NNS - still has a long way to VB ."

DT NN is marked by symptoms WDT are similar to a common cold , as well as a characteristic red rash . Between 2000 and 2010 , DT JJ incidence of measles decreased by 66 % and DT mortality caused by DT NN decreased 74 % , according to a report published in DT journal DT Lancet . Less than two decades ago , measles was almost wiped out in DT NNP NNPS , thanks to NNS . But recently , DT NN has had a resurgence . Globally , DT number of NNS has jumped 30 % due to NN hesitancy . More than 760 NNS of measles were reported in DT U.S. between Jan. 1 and NNP 3 , 2019 , according to Dr. Deepa Mukundan , a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at DT University of Toledo NNP Center in Ohio . This is up from 372 NNS over DT entire NN in 2018 and up from 120 NNS over DT entire NN in 2017 , according to DT Centers for NNP Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . How contagious is PRP ? Measles is caused by Measles morbillivirus , a NN in DT paramyxoviridae family . According to DT CDC , DT measles NN settles in DT nose and throat mucus of an infected person . When a person infected with DT NN coughs , sneezes or exhales , DT NN becomes airborne and can spread to other NNS . "" DT NN can remain in DT air for significant periods of NN , "" Mukundan told Live NNP . "" PRP can VB DT measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been , even up to 2 hours after DT person has left . "" Indeed , DT NN is incredibly contagious — 90 % of NNS who are not vaccinated against measles will become infected if PRP share space with someone who has DT NN . "" Another reason IN PRP is transmitted so effectively is because DT hallmark of measles , DT rash , only comes several days after someone is contagious , "" VBD Dr. Jennifer Lighter , a pediatric infectious NN specialist at NNP York University Langone NNP . Therefore , infected individuals can spread DT NN for several days before realizing PRP 're ill . DT contagious period lasts about four days before and four days after DT rash appears . A person with measles is likely to infect between 5 and 18 unvaccinated NNS , according to a 2019 review published in DT journal Emerging Infectious Diseases . Most NNS of measles cause some combination of cough , runny nose , red eyes , high fever and tiny white to bluish spots in DT mouth , VBD Dr. Aileen M. Marty , a professor of infectious diseases at Florida International University 's Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine in Miami . As DT infection progresses , DT characteristic red rash will develop . DT rash typically looks IN large , red , flat splotches on DT skin . To test for measles , a doctor will examine DT patient for telltale symptoms , such as spots inside of DT mouth and DT skin rash . If DT doctor has any doubt , PRP MD order a blood test to confirm infection , according to DT Mayo Clinic . Almost all NNS require treatment by a doctor . "" This is a NN where complications are common — complications such as ear infection ( acute otitis NN ) , diarrhea and dehydration , pneumonia , encephalitis and even death , "" Marty told Live NNP . "" In DT NNP NNPS , CD to three of every 1,000 infected persons will die from [ measles ] complications — which is better than in DT Third NNP , where as JJ as two to 15 per 100 infected persons die from measles and its complications . "" Young NNS are much more susceptible to DT NN . According to DT Mayo Clinic , measles kills 100,000 NNS a NN , most under DT age of 5 . Pregnant women and those with a compromised immune system are RB at risk of severe complications . EX is no specific drug for treating measles . Instead , doctors treat DT symptoms . "" This means PRP provide / advise hydration , antipyretics ( e.g. , acetaminophen ) for comfort and fever control , airway humidification in patients with respiratory tract involvement , "" Marty VBD . Though not licensed in DT NNP NNPS for DT treatment of measles , some pediatricians have used Ribavirin , an antiviral medication , to treat severe pneumonia caused by measles , Marty added . To protect those who have been exposed to DT NN but have not been vaccinated , a doctor MD order a post - exposure NN . If given within 72 hours of exposure , DT NN MD prevent DT measles . Even if PRP does n't prevent DT NN , DT vaccinated patient will only have a mild case of DT measles , according to DT Mayo Clinic . Another way to protect at - risk individuals is to inject them with immune serum globulin ( antibodies or proteins derived from DT blood of donors with measles immunity ) within six days of exposure to DT NN . IN a NN , this treatment can prevent measles or make DT onset less severe . For JJ NNS , recovering from DT measles includes resting at home until DT symptoms subside . PRP is important for patients to drink plenty of fluids to replace fluids lost during fevers . PRP MD RB be helpful to use a humidifier to relieve congestion and to block out bright lights WDT MD bother sensitive eyes , according to DT Mayo Clinic . Once DT NN has run its course , DT person will be immune to DT NN . However , DT immune system MD be significantly weakened for up to 2 NNS after recovering from DT measles , according to Lighter . During this NN , NNS can be more susceptible to secondary viral and bacterial infections , which MD cause more complications than DT original measles infection . DT best way to prevent measles is by NN . DT CDC recommends 2 doses of DT NN ; DT first for those between 12 and 15 months of age and DT second for NNS between 4 and 6 NNS of age . DT NN is 97 % effective for those who receive both doses and about 93 % effective for those receiving CD . Getting DT proper vaccinations not only protects DT individual receiving DT NN , PRP RB protects those who cannot be vaccinated : those allergic to components of DT NN , those with a compromised immune system or those too young to receive DT NN . "" NNS are CD of DT most effective tools PRP have to protect JJ NN and prevent deaths around DT NN , "" VBD Dr. Scott Lillibridge , an infectious NN expert and professor at DT Texas A&M NNP NNP Center School of NNP NNP . About 94 % of DT U.S. population is vaccinated against measles , according to Mukundan , although EX are pockets of NNS who delay or refuse NNS . DT groups of unvaccinated NNS make PRP difficult to control DT spread of measles , she VBD . "" All measles outbreaks in DT U.S. start either with a visiting international traveler infected with measles or from an unvaccinated U.S. resident returning from an international trip with a measles infection , "" Mukundan VBD . DT infection is then spread to others in DT community who are unvaccinated . Most measles NNS occur in locations with groups of unvaccinated individuals , according to DT CDC . In 2000 , DT U.S. declared IN measles was effectively eliminated in DT country . But since then , DT NN has been making a comeback , likely due to anti-vaxxers . "" DT antivax movement is a small percentage of DT population but PRP are loud and draw a lot of undue NN attention , "" Lighter VBD . Anti-vaxxers are driven by emotion rather than DT NN behind DT NNS , she VBD . Modern opposition to NNS is largely fueled by religious beliefs and DT unwarranted concern IN NNS are somehow linked to NN , among other reasons , according to DT Measles & Rubella Initiative , a collaboration of DT NN 's largest NN organizations WDT aims to eliminate measles and rubella . Before DT measles NN approval in 1963 , an estimated 3 to 4 million NNS in DT U.S. contracted DT measles per NN , with 400 to 500 dying from complications , according to DT CDC . Introduction of DT NN led to a greater than 99 % reduction in measles NNS in DT U.S. A wealth of research has confirmed IN EX is no relationship between NNS and NN and has repeatedly validated DT safety of DT measles NN . "" Protect yourself and your loved ones by making sure IN PRP are up to date on DT measles NN , "" Mukundan VBD . "" Prevention , meaning NN , is always better than cure . "" • Find answers to frequently asked questions about measles , from DT San Francisco Department of NNP NNP . • Learn more about DT measles NN from DT U.S. Department of NNP and Human Services . • Read about DT NNP NNP Organization 's position on DT measles NN and their goal to eradicate measles ."

Some of DT NNS MD be given as part of a combination NN so IN a child gets fewer shots . Talk with your doctor about which NNS your kids need . • HepB : Hepatitis B NN . Ideally , DT first dose is given within 24 hours of birth , but kids not previously immunized can VB PRP at any age . Some low birth weight infants will VB PRP at 1 month or when PRP 're discharged from DT hospital . • HepB : Second dose should be given 1 to 2 months after DT first dose . • Hib : This third dose MD be needed , depending on DT brand of NN used in previous Hib immunizations . • RV : This third dose MD be needed , depending on DT brand of NN used in previous RV immunizations . • Influenza ( NN ) : DT NN NN is recommended every NN for NNS 6 months and older : • Kids younger than 9 who VBP DT NN NN for DT first NN ( or who have only had CD dose before July 2019 ) will VB PRP in 2 separate doses at least a month apart . • Those younger than 9 who have had at least 2 doses of NN NN previously ( in DT same or different seasons ) will only need 1 dose . • Kids older than 9 need only 1 dose . • DT NN is given by injection with a needle ( DT NN shot ) or by nasal spray . Both types of NN can be used this NN season ( 2019 –2020 ) because PRP seem to work equally well . Your doctor will recommend which to use based on your child 's age and general NN . DT nasal spray is only for healthy NNS ages 2 –49 . NNS with weak immune systems or some NN conditions ( such as asthma ) and pregnant women should not VB DT nasal spray NN . • HepA : Hepatitis A NN ; given as 2 shots at least 6 months apart • HPV : Human papillomavirus NN , given in 2 shots over a 6 - to 12 - month period . PRP can be given as early as age 9 . For teens and young adults ( ages 15 – 26 in girls and boys both ) , PRP is given in 3 shots over 6 months . PRP 's recommended for both girls and boys to prevent genital warts and some types of cancer . • Tdap : Tetanus , diphtheria , and pertussis booster . RB recommended during each pregnancy a woman has . • Meningococcal conjugate NN : And a booster dose is recommended at age 16 . • Meningococcal B NN ( MenB ) : DT MenB NN MD be given to kids and teens in 2 or 3 doses , depending on DT brand . Unlike DT meningococcal conjugate NN , which is recommended , DT decision to VB DT MenB NN is made by DT teens , their parents , and DT doctor . • HepA can be given as early as 6 months of age to babies who will travel to a place where hepatitis A is common ( PRP will still need routine NN after their first birthday ) . PRP 's RB recommended for older kids who did not VB PRP in DT past . • DT MMR NN can be given to babies as young as 6 months old if PRP will be traveling internationally . These NNS should still VB DT recommended routine doses at 12 – 15 months and 4 –6 NNS of age , but can VB DT second dose as early as 4 weeks after DT first if PRP will still be traveling and at risk . • DT NN NN is especially important for kids who are at risk for NN problems from DT NN . High - risk groups include , but are n't limited to , kids younger than 5 NNS old and those with chronic JJ conditions , such as asthma , heart problems , sickle cell NN , diabetes , or HIV . • Pneumococcal NNS can be given to older kids ( age 2 and up ) who have conditions WDT affect their immune systems , such as asplenia or HIV infection , or other conditions , IN a cochlear implant , chronic heart NN , or chronic lung NN . • DT meningococcal NNS can be given to kids as young as 8 weeks old ( depending on DT NN brand ) who are at risk for a meningococcal infection , such as meningitis . This includes NNS with some immune disorders . Kids who live in ( or will travel to ) NNS where meningitis is common , or where EX is an outbreak , RB should VB DT NN . Note : An outbreak is when a NN happens in greater numbers than expected in a particular area . If PRP have questions about vaccinating your family during an outbreak , ask your NN care provider or contact your NN or local NN department ."

Sara Cunial , DT Member of Parliament for Rome denounced Bill Gates as a “ NN criminal ” and urged DT Italian NNP to hand him over to DT International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity . She RB exposed Bill Gates ’ agenda in India and Africa , along with DT plans to chip DT human race through DT digital identification program ID2020 . As reported by GreatGameIndia earlier , in 2015 PRP were DT Italians who exposed secret Chinese biological experiments with NNP . DT video , which was broadcast in November , 2015 , showed how Chinese NNS were doing biological experiments on a SARS connected NN believed to be NN , derived from bats and mice , asking whether PRP was worth DT risk in order to be able to modify DT NN for compatibility with human organisms . In an extraordinary seven - minute speech met with wide applause , Sara Cunial , DT Member of Parliament for Rome VBD IN Italy had been subjected to a “ Holy Inquisition of false NN . ” She roundly criticized DT unnecessary lockdown imposed on her fellow Italians in DT service of a globalist agenda . She urged fellow political leaders to desist in any plans to compel citizens to surrender themselves to compulsory NN - CD NN at DT hands of DT corrupt elite – whom she identified as DT Deep NNP . Below is DT transcription of DT full speech delivered to DT Italian Parliament by Sara Cunial , DT Member of Parliament for Rome . Sara Cunial DT Member of Parliament for Rome Speech delivered to DT Italian Parliament NNP 2020 Hobbes VBD IN absolute power does not come from an imposition from above but by DT choice of individuals who feel more protected renouncing to their own freedom and granting PRP to a third party . With this , PRP are VBG on anesthetizing DT minds with corrupted Mass NN with Amuchina ( a brand of disinfectant promoted by Mass NN ) and NLP , with words IN “ regime ” , “ to allow ” and “ to permit ” , to DT point of allowing PRP to regulate our emotional ties and feelings and certify our affects . So , in this way , Phase 2 is nothing else than DT persecution / continuation of Phase 1 – PRP just changed DT name , as PRP did with DT European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) . PRP have understood NNS , for sure , do n’t die for DT NN alone . So NNS will be allowed to die and suffer , thanks to PRP and your laws , for misery and poverty . And , as in DT “ best ” regimes , DT blame will be dropped only on citizens . PRP take away our freedom and say IN PRP looked for PRP . Divide et Impera ( Divide and Rule ) . PRP is our NNS who will lose more , who are ‘ raped souls ’ , with DT help of DT so - called “ guarantor of their rights ” and of CISMAI ( Italian Coordination of Services against Child Abuse ) . In this way , DT right to school will be granted only with a bracelet to VB them used to probation , to VB them used to slavery – involuntary treatment and to virtual lager . All this in exchange for a push - scooter and a tablet . All to satisfy DT appetites of a financial capitalism whose driving force is DT conflict of interest , conflict well represented by DT WHO , whose main financier is DT well - known “ philanthropist and savior of DT NN ” Bill Gates . PRP all VBP PRP , now . Bill Gates , already in 2018 , predicted a pandemic , simulated in October 2019 at DT “ Event 201 ” , together with Davos ( Switzerland ) . For decades , Gates has been working on Depopulation policy and dictatorial control plans on JJ politics , aiming to obtain DT primacy on agriculture , technology and NN . Gates VBD , I quote exactly from his speech : “ If PRP do a good job on NNS , NN and reproduction , PRP can reduce DT NN population by 10 - 15 % . Only a genocide can save DT NN ” . With his NNS , Gates managed to sterilize millions of women in Africa . Gates caused a polio epidemic WDT paralyzed 500,000 NNS in India and still today with DTP , Gates causes more deaths than DT NN itself . And he does DT same with GMOs designed by Monsanto and “ generously donated ” to needy populations . All this while he is already thinking about distributing DT quantum tattoo for NN recognition and mRNA NNS as tools for reprogramming our immune system . In addition , Gates RB does business with several multinationals WDT own 5G facilities in DT USA . On this table EX is DT entire Deep NN in Italian sauce : Sanofi , together with GlaxoSmithKline are friends of DT Ranieri Guerra , Ricciardi , and of DT well - known virologist WDT PRP pay 2000 Euro every 10 minutes for DT presentations on Rai ( Italian NN TV . She ’s probably talking about Burioni ) . Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline sign agreements with JJ societies to indoctrinate future doctors , making fun of their autonomy of judgment and their oath . Hi-Tech multinationals , IN DT Roman Engineering which is friend of DT noble Mantoan , or Bending Spoons , of Pisano , which are RB for control and manage our personal NN datas in agreement with DT European Agenda ID2020 of electronic identification , which aims to use mass NN to obtain a digital platform of digital ID . This is a continuation of DT transfer of data started by Renzi to IBM . Renzi , in 2016 , gave a plus 30 % to Gates NNP Fund . On DT Deep NNP table EX are DT NNS of Aspen , IN DT Saxon Colao , who with his 4 - pages reports , paid 800 Euros / hour , with no scientific review , dictates its politics as a Bilderberg general as he is , staying away from DT battlefield . DT list is long . Very long . In DT list EX is RB Mediatronic , by Arcuri and JJ more . DT Italian contribution to DT International Alliance Against NNP will be of 140 million Euros , of which 120 million Euros will be given to GAVI Alliance , DT non-profit by Gates Foundation . PRP are just a part of DT 7.4 billion Euro fund by DT EU to find a NN against NN – NNS which will be used as I VBD before . No money , ofcourse for serotherapy , which has DT collateral effect of being super cheap . No money for prevention , a real prevention , which includes our lifestyles , our food and our relationship with DT environment . DT real goal of all of this is total control . Absolute domination of human beings , transformed into guinea pigs and slaves , violating sovereignty and free will . All this thanks to tricks / hoax disguised as political compromises . While PRP rip up DT Nuremberg Code with involuntary treatment , fines and deportation , facial recognition and intimidation , endorsed by dogmatic scientism – protected by our “ Multi - NNP ” of DT Republic who is real cultural epidemic of this country . PRP , with DT NNS , will multiply DT fires of resistance in a way WDT PRP wo n’t be able to repress all of PRP . I ask PRP , NNP , to be DT spokesperson and give an advice to our NNP Conte : Dear Mr. NNP Conte , next NN PRP receive a phone call from DT philanthropist Bill Gates forward PRP directly to DT International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity . If PRP wo n’t do this , tell PRP how PRP should define PRP , DT “ friend lawyer ” who takes orders from a criminal .

These diseases cause almost half of all deaths worldwide of NNS under age 45 , killing over eight million NNS each NN and orphaning millions more . DT NNP committed DT NNP NNPS to addressing this terrible problem in his September speech to DT NNP Nations General Assembly . Now DT NNP is asking for foundations , pharmaceutical companies , international agencies , and other governments to join PRP in this task , and he is announcing these specific elements of his Millennium Initiative : • A JJ financial commitment to purchase and deliver existing NNS in poor NNS . As Vice NNP Gore told DT U. N. Security Council earlier this month , DT Administration�s FY 2001 budget will include a proposed $ 50 million contribution to DT NN purchase fund of DT NNP Alliance for NNPS and Immunization ( GAVI ) . • Increased investments in NN in developing NNS . DT NNP is calling on DT NNP Bank and other multilateral development banks to dedicate an additional $ 400 million to $ 900 million annually of their low - interest - rate loans to expand immunization , prevent and treat infectious diseases , and build effective delivery systems for other basic NN services . These investments are as central to JJ progress as investments in education and physical infrastructure , and PRP MD build on DT JJ focus on basic NN services WDT PRP have supported as part of DT Highly Indebted Poor NNPS ( HIPC ) debt initiative . This proposed shift in existing resources does not require additional U.S. budget expenditures . • A significant increase in basic research on diseases WDT affect developing nations . DT Administration�s FY 2001 budget for DT National Institutes of NNP includes a sharp step - up in research critical to DT development of NNS for malaria , tuberculosis , and HIV / AIDS . • A JJ tax credit for sales of NNS for malaria , tuberculosis , and HIV / AIDS to accelerate DT invention and production of these NNS . Because developing NNS often cannot afford to buy NNS , DT market provides little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to develop NNS for diseases WDT disproportionately affect those NNS . This tax credit MD provide such an incentive , because every dollar paid by a qualifying organization to buy a qualifying NN MD be matched by a dollar of tax credits � representing up to $ 1 billion of additional funding for future NN purchases . DT NNP is calling on other governments to make similar purchase commitments , so IN PRP can ensure a future market for these critically needed NNS . Infectious Diseases Pose a Mounting Social and JJ Burden on Developing NNS � And a Threat to Our NN As Well . • More than eight million NNS die each NN of centuries - old diseases IN malaria , tuberculosis , and respiratory and diarrheal diseases . Deaths from DT modern scourge of AIDS are climbing rapidly . Altogether , as JJ NNS die of infectious diseases each NN as DT total number of combatants who perished in NNP War I . • In an interconnected and highly mobile NN , NN crises in other NNS are a threat to everyone . PRP have seen this with HIV / AIDS , with DT resurfacing of tuberculosis , and with DT outbreak last NN of West Nile encephalitis in NNP York . According to DT NNP NNP Council , during DT past 50 NNS , at least five times as JJ Americans have died from communicable diseases WDT have come from DT developing NN than have died in military conflicts . NNS Are CD of DT Most Cost - Effective Ways to Improve DT Well - Being and Productivity of DT Poorest NNS � And Medicines and Other Basic NN Services Are a Necessary Complement . • PRP costs about $ 17 to immunize a child , but millions of NNS die each NN of diseases WDT MD be prevented by existing NNS . Indeed , NNS in developing nations are 10 times more likely to die of a NN - preventable NN than NNS in developed nations . And these tragedies occur in spite of DT enormous efforts of UNICEF and others to vaccinate NNS , which save 3 million lives each NN . • Highly effective NNS do not yet exist for malaria , TB and AIDS , which take over 5 million lives each NN . But developed nations have DT scientific and technological capacity to make JJ NNS possible . For example , recent work on genetic sequencing , including DT human genome , will open vast possibilities . • Another NN investment with very high returns is simple preventive and curative services . Providing this basic NN care together with NNS MD save millions of lives each NN . A $ 50 Million Contribution to GAVI to Buy NNS For NNS � Which Will Save Lives Now and Create Confidence WDT a Market for JJ NNS Will Exist in DT Future . • GAVI , DT NNP Alliance for NNPS and Immunization , was formed as a collaborative effort of UNICEF , DT NNP NNP Organization ( WHO ) , DT NNP Bank , private foundations , bilateral aid agencies ( including DT U.S. Agency for International Development ) , industry representatives , and developing NNS . GAVI established DT � NNP Fund for Children�s NNPS � with an initial grant of $ 750 million over 5 NNS from DT Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation . DT formal launch of GAVI , and DT official announcement of DT Gates gift , will occur shortly in Davos , Switzerland . • A U.S. contribution will help to purchase NNS for Hepatitis B , Haemophilus Influenzae B ( Hib ) , and Yellow Fever , along with related safe delivery equipment such as auto - destruct syringes . To ensure IN GAVI�s NN purchases complement , rather than replace , existing NN efforts , PRP will be conditional on a country achieving 50 percent coverage of DT DTP ( diptheria - tetanus - pertussis ) NN , which is included along with measles and polio in DT existing EPI ( Expanded Program for Immunization ) . • A U.S. contribution will hopefully catalyze significant contributions from other NNS and foundations . PRP will RB add crucial credibility to DT international community�s commitment to provide a market for JJ NNS when PRP are developed . PRP Must Shift Existing International Resources Toward Building NNP Infrastructure in Poor NNPS WDT Can Deliver NNS and Medicines and Provide Essential Basic NNP Services . • DT NNP Bank and other multilateral development banks ( MDBs , such as DT African Development Fund ) lend money on highly favorable terms to DT world�s poorest NNS . Today , roughly $ 1 billion to $ 1 - 1/ 2 billion of this so - called � concessional funding � is devoted to NN care each NN . DT Administration proposes to increase DT amount by $ 400 million to $ 900 million per NN , with a focus on : • prevention of diseases using basic measures such as information and condoms for AIDS , treated bed nets for malaria , and stronger systems for containing TB ; • treatment of diseases , including common respiratory and diarrheal infections ; and • DT Administration is exploring ways to use DT HIPC debt reform to support this part of DT Millennium Initiative . CD possibility is to make an increase in NN rates CD of DT performance targets monitored in DT HIPC progress reports . This MD be accompanied by debtor NNS � agreements to include specific improvements in NN delivery systems as priority uses of debt relief proceeds . PRP RB expect IN all Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers WDT are prepared for HIPC candidates will discuss DT adequacy of budget resources and suggested policy reforms devoted to basic NN care . • This re-direction of resources supports DT Administration�s overall strategy for JJ development , which emphasizes poverty reduction and gives a central role to �global JJ goods � � IN NN or DT environment � in which positive actions taken in CD country benefit other NNS as well . To meet this objective , these funds should not come from spending on other basic social programs , such as education and NN care . • This aspect of DT Millennium Initiative does not require a JJ budgetary commitment by DT NNP NNPS ( or other donor NNS ) . However , DT U.S. ability to influence DT direction of MDB lending and DT use of HIPC proceeds depends crucially on meeting our existing commitments to these aid programs . PRP will work with other G - 8 finance and development ministries to refine this proposal . • A conservative estimate suggests IN if basic NN care including immunization were made broadly available , up to 2 million children�s lives MD be saved each NN . Higher Funding for Basic Scientific Research Through DT National Institutes of NNP ( NIH ) and Elsewhere Will Hasten DT Development of NNS for Malaria , TB , and AIDS . • DT Administration�s FY 2001 budget for NIH includes a significant increase in research critical to creating NNS for these diseases . For malaria and TB , this increase will build on recent advances in DT genetic sequencing of these diseases , which have set DT stage for major breakthroughs in NN development . • Funding for NIH malaria NN research will increase more than 10 percent over DT FY 2000 level . Future research will range from pre-clinical studies aimed at improving our understanding of DT malaria parasite , through DT development of NN candidates , to clinical trials judging NN efficacy and safety . NIH will RB expand its collaboration with NNS in malaria - endemic regions , especially in Africa , to strengthen those regions � capacity for conducting clinical trials of malaria NNS in DT future . • NIH research on a tuberculosis NN will receive over 40 percent more funding than in FY 2000 and more than double DT FY 1999 level . NIH will focus on studying DT body�s defense mechanisms against TB , and developing and studying NN candidates . Through its Tuberculosis Research Unit , NIH supports an international multi-disciplinary team to translate advances in basic research into JJ tools for fighting TB . • NIH funding for AIDS NN research will increase substantially in FY 2001 and will have more than doubled since FY 1997 . These additional resources will allow NIH to accelerate basic research on developing NN candidates and to significantly expand testing of potential NN candidates in both developing and developed NNS . DT JJ NNP Research Center on DT NIH campus , which will be occupied this summer , will receive a sizeable increase in funding for DT development and pre-clinical testing of HIV NN candidates . • DT Administration is providing strong support for DT path - breaking research on infectious diseases being conducted by U.S. military NNS , including DT opening ( in October 1999 ) of DT Walter Reed Army Institute of Research / Naval NNP Research Center . Working in close collaboration with NNS worldwide , military NNS have developed and tested successful NNS against Japanese encephalitis and hepatitis A � and PRP are working to create NNS and medicines to protect service NNS , travelers , and millions of others from malaria , HIV / AIDS , and other infectious diseases . A JJ Tax Credit MD Effectively Provide Up to $ 1 Billion for Future NN Purchases , Speeding DT Invention and Production of JJ NNS . • Current tax law provides substantial incentives for pharmaceutical research and development , including DT research and experimentation ( R&E ) tax credit , DT orphan drug tax credit , and an enhanced deduction for charitable contributions of certain products . Nonetheless , pharmaceutical companies MD be reluctant to invest in developing NNS for diseases WDT primarily afflict NNS in poor NNS , because little or no paying market exists in those NNS . • Under DT proposal , DT seller of a qualified NN MD claim a tax credit equal to 100 percent of DT amount paid by a qualifying organization WDT received a �credit allocation� by DT U.S. Agency for International Development ( AID ) . DT tax credit MD match DT qualified organizations � expenditures dollar - for - dollar , thereby doubling their purchasing power . A qualifying NN MD be a JJ NN WDT received FDA approval for use against malaria , tuberculosis , HIV / AIDS , or any infectious NN WDT causes over 1 million deaths annually worldwide . • For 2002 through 2010 , AID MD designate up to $ 1 billion of NN sales as eligible for DT credit . This tax credit MD be limited to JJ NNS developed to fight these terrible diseases . DT credit MD provide a specific and credible commitment to purchase future NNS at reasonable prices . Together with similar commitments from foundations and other governments , PRP MD provide a critical and powerful incentive to accelerate NN research and development ."

""_''","DT measles , mumps and rubella ( MMR ) NN is not linked to development of NN spectrum disorders , even among NNS considered to be at risk , a large JJ NN finds . Among nearly 100,000 NNS , receipt of DT MMR NN did not increase DT risk for NN spectrum disorder ( ASD ) , regardless of whether kids were at higher risk because an older sibling already had DT condition , researchers write in JAMA . "" Even for NNS who are high - risk , DT NN does not play a role , "" VBD lead author Dr. Anjali Jain of healthcare consulting firm DT Lewin Group in Falls Church , Virginia . "" PRP do n’t VB what does unfortunately , but PRP ’s not DT MMR NN . "" DT results should be reassuring , she VBD . NN spectrum disorder is a range of symptoms WDT often includes difficulties with communication and social interaction , according to DT U.S. National Institute of Mental NNP . PRP 's MD RB include restricted and repetitive behaviors . DT 1998 NN WDT claimed to find a connection between DT MMR NN and ASD was later debunked . DT Lancet , DT JJ journal WDT originally published PRP , withdrew PRP . Studies continue to vouch for DT safety of DT NN . Still , some NNS continue to believe IN DT NN is connected to ASD . Parents of NNS with ASD MD RB believe EX is a genetic component , and so PRP decline to vaccinate their other NNS , Jain and colleagues noted in their report in DT Journal of DT American NNP Association . For DT JJ NN , DT researchers used insurance claims data on 95,727 NNS followed from birth to at least age five between 2001 and 2012 . PRP RB had data on DT NNS 's older siblings . Overall , about 2 percent of DT NNS had an older sibling with ASD . Those NNS were more likely to VB on to develop ASD themselves whether PRP were vaccinated or not , according to DT report . DT NN did n't increase their risk , DT researchers say . For example , among high - risk five NN olds , ASD developed in 23 of 269 who were n't vaccinated ( 8.6 percent ) , compared to 30 of 796 ( 3.8 percent ) who received two doses of DT MMR NN . Among kids not at high risk of ASD , 7,735 were unvaccinated at age five and 56 ( 0.7 percent ) were diagnosed with DT condition . DT compared to 244 of 45,568 NNS ( 0.5 percent ) who received two MMR doses . Furthermore , NNS with an older sibling with ASD were significantly less likely to have received DT MMR NN in DT first place . By age five , about 92 percent of DT NNS without ASD in DT family had received at least CD MMR dose . By comparison , only 86 percent of NNS with an older sibling with ASD had been vaccinated by DT age . "" I VBP PRP ’s important to show IN DT degree of undervaccination in DT families with NNS with NN spectrum disorder was significant , "" Jain told Reuters NNP . Alongside DT lack of association between DT NN and ASD , DT undervaccination rate deserves attention , she VBD . Roughly a dozen studies have shown IN age of ASD onset and its severity do not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated NNS , wrote Dr. Bryan King , program director of DT NNP Center at Seattle NNP 's Hospital , in an editorial accompanying DT JJ NN . DT JJ NN , King added , now shows IN "" DT risk of ASD recurrence in families does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated NNS . """

During a live interview on Sirius XM radio , DT nation ’s top doctor VBD IN data from DT NNP NNP Organization ( WHO ) , U.S. Centers for NNP Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , and Bill Gates ( “ King NNP ” ) MD be shelved in favor of real data : “ What DT American NNS need to VB now is PRP actually have data and so PRP ’re tracking DT data . ” Alarmingly high WHO estimates of DT number of NNS in this country considered at risk from getting and dying from DT Wuhan NN have proven to be grossly inaccurate . Hundreds of thousands of Americans have not succumbed to DT novel strain of infection , as these self - styled experts insisted . PRP has been confirmed IN various NN reporting agencies have artificially inflated DT real number of diagnosed NNS and deaths directly due to a NN - CD infection . DT reason behind this charade is to generate fear , make DT masses compliant with NNP NNP Order directives , and topple DT U.S. economy . A growing number of independent international NN experts are contradicting DT alarmism being spread around DT NN in DT face of a bad case of DT NN . Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi , a microbiology specialist , professor at DT Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz , Germany , and head of DT Institute for NNP Microbiology and Hygiene , VBD : “ PRP are afraid IN 1 million infections with DT JJ NN will lead to 30 deaths per day over DT next 100 days . But PRP do not realize IN 20 , 30 , 40 or 100 patients positive for normal coronaviruses are already dying every day . ” [ emphasis added ] Dr. Bhakdi called DT NN ’s NNP - CD response measures “ grotesque , absurd and very dangerous , ” and added IN PRP are shortening DT life expectancy of millions of NNS . DT panic is a fraud , according to DT much - cited research scientist : “ DT horrifying impact on DT NN economy threatens DT existence of countless NNS . DT consequences on JJ care are profound . Already services to patients in need are reduced , operations canceled , practices empty , hospital personnel dwindling . All this will impact profoundly on our whole society . “ All these measures are leading to self - destruction and collective suicide based on nothing but a spook . ” Dr. Joel Kettner , a professor of Community NNP Sciences and Surgery at Manitoba University in Canada , former Chief NNP NNP Officer for Manitoba province , and NNP Director of DT International Centre for Infectious Diseases , VBD : “ I have never seen anything IN this , anything anywhere near IN this . I ’m not talking about DT pandemic , because I ’ve seen 30 of them , CD every NN . PRP is called influenza . And other respiratory illness viruses , PRP do n’t always VB what PRP are . But I ’ve never seen this reaction , and I ’m trying to understand why . ” JJ observers agree with Dr. Kettner ’s assessment of DT message being broadcast by DT globalist NN nazis : “ I worry about DT message to DT NN , about DT fear of coming into contact with NNS , being in DT same space as NNS , shaking their hands , having meetings with NNS . I worry about JJ , JJ consequences related to DT . ” Adams told Alex Marlow , host of Breitbart NNP Daily , IN DT real numbers show IN businesses are safe to re-open in NNP and June . DT NWO NN nazis VBP U.S. business owners to fail by keeping them idle for six months or more . PRP are trying to push a national NN ID card WDT MD determine whether or not citizens can travel or renew their driver ’s licenses . DT Surgeon General VBD IN , based on actual test data rather than doomsday prophesies based on theoretical computer simulations , U.S. businesses “ in some places ” can expect to resume operations in NNP or June . Locations hardest hit by DT contagion , however , will continue living with DT current JJ lockdown : “ Other places wo n’t ; PRP will be piece by piece , bit by bit , but will be data - driven , ” advised Adams . Frustrated citizens around DT U.S. are gathering at their statehouses to voice their opposition to DT prolonged enforced idleness and ridiculously unfair JJ rules on what is nonessential , including tools and seeds , from petty bureaucrats enjoying expanded powers under DT national emergency ."

At DT forefront of DT search stands Dr. David Baltimore , chairman of DT National Institute of Health's AIDS NNP Research Committee . Currently NN of DT California Institute of Technology as well , Baltimore won DT 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine . Betsey Arledge , producer of DT NOVA film "" Surviving AIDS , "" interviewed a cautiously optimistic Baltimore on DT current NN of DT search for a NN . NOVA : Can PRP give me a sense of DT magnitude of DT AIDS epidemic at this NN ? Baltimore : DT AIDS epidemic in this country is a serious issue , but it's not a major JJ NN disaster DT way PRP is abroad . In DT NN today EX are something IN 34 million infected NNS , and more NNS are being infected every minute . On DT scale of any JJ NN issue in DT NN , this is CD of DT major ones . EX are more NNS dying of AIDS than of almost any other infectious NN , with tuberculosis and malaria being in DT same ballpark . PRP 's a horrendous situation . ( See AIDS in Perspective . ) NOVA : Do PRP VB PRP 're getting a little complacent in this country ? Baltimore : I 'm impressed IN AIDS remains a very noted NN in DT NNP NNPS . PRP 's noted in DT newspapers all DT NN — what 's VBG on in DT NN and in DT country . EX is very complete coverage of how good DT drugs are and where DT NN program stands . I do n't VB PRP 've allowed PRP to fall off DT radar screen . And PRP do far more AIDS research than DT whole rest of DT NN ; in DT NN area alone , PRP do probably 90 percent of DT research . NOVA : Can PRP give me a sense of DT amount of effort — not just money , but intellectual effort — WDT has gone into trying to find a NN over DT past 10 or 15 NNS ? Baltimore : When H.I.V. was first discovered , DT first thing WDT DT then -Secretary of what became DT U.S. Department of NNP and Human Services VBD was , "" PRP will have a NN in short order . "" She was wrong about DT , but PRP shows IN from DT very first moment a NN was on NNS 's minds . Indeed , EX has been a significant effort to make a NN from DT very first day . I VBP NNS thought PRP MD be simple , because PRP 'd made NNS for so JJ different viruses . DT polio NN is effective because , for DT most part , our bodies naturally fight this NN . This is not DT case with HIV . DT thing WDT worried me at DT NN — and PRP has turned out to be DT biggest worry — was IN if PRP were possible to make a NN , why does n't DT body ordinarily fight off DT NN ? Most viruses PRP fight off very well , including polio and even smallpox . A certain fraction of NNS MD be maimed or killed by those viruses , but DT much larger fraction of NNS VBP over them . DT 's not true for H.I.V . PRP knew DT from very early on . At first PRP thought PRP might be IN JJ NNS MD be killed by PRP , and then PRP began to realize IN almost everybody who had DT infection was potentially VBG to be killed by PRP . DT 's fundamentally different than other viruses . And DT fundamental difference was a red flag . DT initial impetus WDT we'd be able to do PRP , PRP 's around DT corner , was just all wrong . NOVA : So DT search for a NN has been a real struggle ? Baltimore : PRP 's been an enormous struggle , because DT obvious things did n't work , and NNS got very frustrated by DT . DT next question became : Where do PRP turn ? What 's not obvious ? What can PRP do ? DT involved bringing a whole different level of NNS into DT discussion . Not DT ordinary NNS who make NNS , but NNS whose scientific focus is in other areas of immunology , of infectious NN — basic NNS . So PRP 's been a ramping up process to VB more and more NNS involved and thinking about PRP . Perhaps DT most important role of DT committee I 'm now heading is to galvanize DT scientific community to find JJ routes in thinking about a NN , so IN maybe PRP can find a NN through some very non-traditional approach . NOVA : An international team of NNS announced recently IN PRP had traced DT origin of DT AIDS NN to a subspecies of chimpanzee in Africa . If this report is verified , how will PRP help in DT search for a NN ? Baltimore : In truth , PRP will not have much effect on DT search for a NN . However , PRP tells PRP a lot about why HIV is so hard to counter . PRP is not a NN WDT is native to DT human species , and therefore PRP is continually mutating in an effort to adapt . Most human viruses are well - controlled by DT human immune system , because PRP have evolved with PRP , and DT two opposing forces are in a steady - NN . PRP cannot wait until PRP and HIV evolve to being comfortable with each other . PRP must devise a NN , effectively short - circuiting DT usual process of adaptation . NOVA : Who are DT so - called long - term non-progressors , and how do PRP fit into DT search ? Bob Massie is a long - term non-progressor . His immune system 's ability to fight HIV is inspiring a JJ approach to fighting AIDS . Baltimore : EX is a small group of H.I.V.- infected NNS — maybe five percent — who do n't VB any symptoms and whose NN is maintained at a very low level . If PRP MD find out DT secret behind DT , maybe PRP MD replicate PRP in a NN . So far PRP have n't found DT secret , but EX are good correlations . These NNS have a good cytotoxic T lymphocyte response , PRP have a good helper T cell response . [ Cytotoxic T lymphocytes , otherwise known as CTLs or CD8 killer T - cells , are cells involved in immune defense WDT can kill other cells infected by viruses . So - called CD4 helper T cells are essential for triggering antibody production , activating CTLs , and initiating other immune responses . ] So DT says if PRP can make those a focus of activity , maybe PRP can design a NN around those principles . But EX 's no certainty IN those are DT key issues . EX is a balance of three things : whether DT NN WDT those NNS have is different than DT NN other NNS have ; whether their immune system is somehow responding to PRP differently than other NNS 's immune systems are ; and whether their genetics are different . Are PRP inherently able to fight DT NN ? Or is PRP something WDT 's learned and IN therefore PRP MD teach other NNS to do ?

DT NN is called NVX - CoV2373 and is from a NNP biotech company , Novavax . DT trial will be carried out across Melbourne and Brisbane , and is DT first human trial of a NN specifically for NNP - CD to take place in Australia . This NN is actually based on a NN WDT was already in development for influenza . But how might PRP work against SARS - CoV - 2 , DT NN WDT causes NN - CD ? Read more : MD BCG , a 100 - NN - old NN for tuberculosis , protect against NN ? NNS trigger an immune response by introducing DT cells of our immune system to a NN in a safe way , without any exposure to DT pathogen itself . All NNS have to do two things . DT first is make our immune cells bind to and “ eat up ” DT NN . DT second is to activate these immune cells so PRP ’re prepared to fight DT current and any subsequent threats from DT NN in question . PRP often add molecules called adjuvants to NNS to deliver a danger signal to DT immune system , activate immune cells and trigger a strong immune response . Read more : Revealed : DT protein ' spike ' WDT lets DT 2019 - nCoV NN pierce and invade human cells DT Novavax NN is what PRP call a “ subunit ” NN because , instead of delivering DT whole NN , PRP delivers only part of PRP . DT element of SARS - CoV - 2 in this NN is DT spike protein , which is found on DT surface of DT NN . By targeting a particular protein , a subunit NN is a great way to focus DT immune response . However , protein by itself is not very good at binding to and activating DT cells of our immune system . Proteins are generally soluble , which does n’t appeal to immune cells . PRP VBP something PRP can chew on . So instead of soluble protein , Novavax has assembled DT SARS - CoV - 2 spike protein into very small particles , called nanoparticles . To immune cells , these nanoparticles look IN little viruses , so immune cells can bind to these pre-packaged chunks of protein , rapidly engulfing them and becoming activated . DT Novavax NN RB contains an adjuvant called Matrix - M. While DT nanoparticles deliver a modest danger signal , Matrix - M can be added to deliver a much stronger danger signal and really wake up DT immune system . DT Novavax NN for SARS - CoV - 2 is based on a NN DT company was already developing for influenza , called NanoFlu . DT NanoFlu NN contains similar parts – nanoparticles with DT Matrix - M adjuvant . But PRP uses a different protein in DT nanoparticle ( hemagglutinin , which is on DT outside of DT influenza NN ) . In October last NN , Novavax started testing NanoFlu in a phase III clinical trial , DT last level of clinical testing before a NN can be licensed . This trial had 2,650 volunteers and researchers were comparing whether NanoFlu performed as well as Fluzone , a standard influenza NN . Read more : Where are PRP at with developing a NN for NN ? An important feature of this trial is participants were over DT age of 65 . Older NNS tend to have poorer responses to NNS , because immune cells become more difficult to activate as PRP age . This trial is ongoing , with volunteers to be followed until DT end of DT NN . However , early results suggest NanoFlu can generate significantly higher levels of antibodies than Fluzone – even given DT older NNS in DT trial . Antibodies are small proteins made by our immune cells which bind strongly to viruses and can stop them from infecting cells in DT nose and lungs . So increased antibodies with NanoFlu should result in lower rates of infection with influenza . These results were similar to those released after DT phase I trial of NanoFlu , and suggest NanoFlu MD be DT superior NN for influenza . So DT big question is – will DT same strategy work for SARS - CoV -2 ? DT JJ phase I / II trial will enrol around 131 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 59 to assess DT NN ’s safety and measure how PRP affects DT body ’s immune response . Some volunteers will not receive DT NN , as a placebo control . DT rest will receive DT NN , in a few different forms . DT trial will test two doses of protein nanoparticles – a low ( 5 microgram ) or a high ( 25 microgram ) dose . Both doses will be delivered with Matrix - M adjuvant but DT higher dose will RB be tested without Matrix -M . All groups will receive two shots of DT NN 21 days apart , except CD group WDT will just VB CD shot . This design enables researchers to ask four important questions : • None can DT NN induce an immune response ? • None if so , what dose of nanoparticle is best ? • None do PRP need adjuvant or are nanoparticles enough ? • None do PRP need two shots or is CD enough ? Read more : NN anti-vaxxers are n’t a huge threat yet . How do PRP keep PRP DT way ? While PRP ’s not yet clear how DT NN will perform for SARS - CoV - 2 , Novavax has reported PRP generated strong immune responses in animals . And PRP VBP NanoFlu performed well and had a good safety profile for influenza . NanoFlu RB seemed to work well in older adults , which MD be essential for a NN for NN - CD . PRP eagerly await DT first set of results , expected in a couple of months – an impressive turnaround NN for a clinical trial . If this initial NN is successful , DT phase II portion of DT trial will begin , with more participants . DT Novavax NN joins at least nine other NN candidates for SARS - CoV - 2 currently in clinical testing around DT NN ."

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] He RB founded DT Good NNP Doctor Foundation , which aimed to combine Christian beliefs with his JJ practice . [ 7 ] Bradstreet obtained a Florida JJ license in 1984 . He received a Bachelor of NNP degree from DT University of South Florida in 1976 , where he RB went to JJ school beginning three NNS later . His postgraduate research focused on aerospace medicine , and he received his training in this field from Wilford Hall NNP Center . He was an adjunct professor of child development and neuroscience at DT Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine in Tempe , Arizona . [ 8 ] Bradstreet published NN research , which he claimed indicated NNS as a cause , in DT Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons , which is not indexed by PubMed . This research claimed IN autistic NNS had a higher body burden of mercury , [ 9 ] and IN three autistic NNS had measles RNA in their cerebrospinal fluid . [ 10 ] DT Institute of Medicine has rejected any relationship between NNS and NN . [ 11 ] Bradstreet treated an autistic child named Colten Snyder ( CD of DT test NNS in DT NN omnibus trial ) with chelation therapy on DT premise of removing mercury from his body , in spite of DT fact IN hair , blood , and urine tests had failed to show he exhibited abnormal levels of mercury . [ 12 ] Over an eight - NN period , Colten visited Bradstreet 's office 160 times . [ 13 ] Stephen Barrett has stated , "" PRP appears to me IN Bradstreet decides which of his nonstandard theories to apply and records diagnoses WDT embody them , "" and describes Bradstreet 's mercury provoked tests as "" phony "" . [ 12 ] Peter Hotez characterized Bradstreet 's proposal to treat NN with chelation therapy as "" dangerous . "" [ 6 ] In an interview with DT Chicago Tribune , Bradstreet defended DT use of intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) as an NN treatment , saying , "" Every kid with NN should have a trial of IVIG if money was not an option and IVIG was abundant . "" [ 14 ] Bradstreet RB published research regarding DT use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for NN , [ 15 ] some of which concluded PRP was ineffective , [ 16 ] as well as a paper arguing IN autistic NNS have an increased vulnerability to oxidative stress . [ 17 ] Further treatments Bradstreet used on autistic NNS included DT controversial protein GcMAF , with which he claimed to have treated 600 NNS . [ 18 ] In an article for an anti-vaccine magazine , Bradstreet endorsed stem cell therapy as an NN treatment . [ CD ] Bradstreet was found dead from a gunshot wound to DT chest in DT Broad River in Rutherford County , North Carolina in June 2015 , after his Buford , Georgia JJ office was raided by DT FDA in connection with an investigation into GcMAF treatments . [ 4] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] At DT NN of his death , he lived in Braselton and ran his JJ practice in Buford . [ 4 ] While DT police ruled Bradstreet 's death a suicide , several family members and anti-vaccine activists claimed he was murdered in connection with his criticism of NNS . [ 22 ] Bradstreet 's son is autistic , which Bradstreet attributed to a NN his son received at age 15 months .

Since last autumn , more than 150 NNS have been recorded in Rockland County , a NNP York suburb home to a large ultra-Orthodox Jewish community where EX has been some resistance to vaccinations . DT vast majority of NNP NNS allow families to opt out of getting vaccinated if PRP object on religious grounds and parents seem to take advantage of these rules . Researchers have found IN broad philosophical and religious exemptions to NN requirements are associated with higher rates of unvaccinated NNS . But this NN ’s outbreaks are now raising JJ NN questions about why NNS allow such exemptions . Here is how religious exemptions work : What is a religious exemption to a NN , and which NNP NNPS have them ? Religious exemptions allow parents to opt their NNS out of mandated NN policies if PRP object to DT NN for religious reasons and if PRP follow DT NN ’s opt - out process . Almost every NN , plus Washington DC , allows for a religious exemption beginning at least in kindergarten . Four NNS do not : California , West Virginia , Mississippi and Arizona . Each NN has its own rules regarding vaccinations for NNS who attend JJ schools . In addition to DT religious exemption , all 50 NNS , plus Washington DC , allow exceptions for JJ reasons . Examples include a child who has a condition IN cancer or an immune disorder where a NN MD be harmful to DT child ’s NN . And more than a dozen NNS offer philosophical exemptions , sometimes known as personal - belief exemptions , which do not require IN a parent ’s desire to opt out be specifically about their religious beliefs . Instead , PRP can include exemptions for conscience or moral ideology . California , West Virginia and Mississippi , which do not allow religious exemptions , RB do not allow philosophical objections . How are religious exemptions connected to DT recent NNP measles outbreak ? DT measles outbreak in DT NNP York suburb of Rockland County has largely been cantered in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community , where EX has been some recent resistance to vaccinations . NN rates tend to be low among DT ultra-Orthodox , and DT reasons vary , from fear of interference from outsiders to confusion over accurate religious and JJ information . DT current flare - up in NNP York and NNP Jersey , both of which allow religious exemptions , can be traced back to DT measles outbreaks in Israel last NN . Because ultra-Orthodox parents often send their NNS to their own religious schools , DT outbreak was initially largely contained . But PRP has recently spread significantly . Some Orthodox Jewish schools have been allowing unvaccinated NNS to attend school , against DT NNP York NNP Department ’s mandate , during DT measles outbreak . How are NNS a religious issue for some NNS ? Some NNS worry IN vaccinating interrupts a divine plan for someone ’s life , and PRP do not VB to interfere in God ’s will . Others have concerns IN some NNS MD violate religious dietary laws , unless PRP are designated kosher or halal . Last NN an influential Islamic group in Indonesia issued a controversial fatwa , which was later overturned , against DT measles - mumps - rubella , or MMR , NN , citing its use of porcine gelatin . And JJ of those who oppose abortion object to certain NNS , IN those designed to prevent chickenpox or hepatitis A . Those NNS are made by growing viruses in fetal embryo fibroblast cells , or cell lines WDT are grown in laboratories but are derived from two elective abortions in DT 1960s . A Catholic family in Kentucky , for example , has filed a lawsuit against DT Northern Kentucky NNP Department for banning unvaccinated students from school and athletics during a chickenpox outbreak at their son ’s Catholic school . Are DT recent measles outbreaks causing some NNP NNS to reconsider exemptions ? To an extent , yes . NN exemptions for NNS enrolled in kindergarten have slowly grown over DT past decade , according to DT Centres for NNP Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , prompting some NNS to consider changes . California got rid of its non-medical exemptions in 2015 . A few NNS WDT allow religious exemptions have made them more difficult to VB , requiring things IN a signed affidavit from a religious leader instead of simply filling out an online form . NN lawmakers , often Republicans , around DT country introduced more than 150 bills from 2011 through 2017 WDT MD have made PRP easier to obtain exemptions from NN policies . But according to a NN in DT American Journal of NNP NNP published in January , DT 13 bills signed into law actually limited DT ability to exempt . Some professional organisations have RB taken action . DT American Association of Pediatrics has made DT elimination of non-medical NN exemptions its top priority this NN , even ranking PRP above family separations at DT border . Are religious leaders doing anything to address DT issue ? Yes . Rabbis and doctors organised a JJ NN campaign to stress DT importance of NNS . DT Orthodox Union and DT Rabbinal Council of America have strongly urged parents to vaccinate their NNS . “ PRP is well known IN those facing even a potential life - or - death situation are instructed to set aside DT Sabbath and other key tenets of halachic ( Jewish law ) observance until DT emergency has passed , ” PRP VBD in November . Elsewhere , local NN and community leaders have stressed open communication between NN officials and religious leaders to bridge cultural divides . In Colorado , Dr Joshua Williams , an assistant professor of pediatrics at DT University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine , has recommended IN DT groups talk at specific times , such as when DT academic NN begins or at DT start of influenza season , and not just during a NN crisis . He is RB working with DT NN ’s Council of Churches to hold sessions with parishioners to hear their concerns . “ Religious vaccinations exemptions impact JJ NN , ” Dr Williams VBD . “ EX is a need to dialogue with religious leaders around NN exemptions at local and national levels . ”"

Sinclair explains , “ DT effect of DT NN was literally to shut down business globally , therefore , shut off DT demand for loans , which RB shut off demand for short term money . So , what DT NN has not seen , is not considering and does not understand is PRP were stepping into DT door of a major financial crisis magnitudes larger than what happened in 2008 and 2009 . PRP ’s a horrible thing WDT this NN occurred , but if PRP had not occurred , PRP MD have been in a crisis much more serious than 2008 and 2009 . . . . PRP was blowing sky high . . . . Shutting down demand is all PRP MD do . PRP stopped DT explosion of interest rates . ” Where do PRP VB from here ? Sinclair says , “ PRP are VBG to make a recovery . PRP ’s not VBG to be a ‘ V ’ by any means . DT stock market MD be a ‘ V ’ because DT stock market has very little to do with reality . . . . As far as business is concerned , very serious damage has been done to DT infrastructure to DT business equation . JJ employers are gone . JJ corporations have significant readjustments to be able to build up again . DT supply lines and logistics , where did everything come from ? NNP . . . . This is a major worldwide adjustment , both economically and politically . . . . PRP had everything made in DT cheapest place possible . . . . This is not a passing phenomenon . . . . DT only thing WDT has been steady is gold . . . . DT NN WDT this brings about is a reconstruction of DT basic business foundations . PRP ’s a start over , PRP ’s not just a slowdown . How JJ restaurants make money on 50 % of DT clients ? PRP can ’t . How JJ automobiles have built up on DT lots ? Enormous amounts . How JJ clothing stores shut down full of winter clothes and ca n’t make DT shift to summer wear ? PRP can VB down DT entire line . So , this recovery will be more IN an ‘ L ’ . PRP ’ve come straight down , and PRP are VBG to VB sideways now . . . . JJ businesses are not VBG to open up again . . . . DT idea of DT coming inflation as a result of this is simple . Everything WDT PRP need will VB up in price . Everything PRP do n’t need is not VBG to hold value . PRP are better off with a freezer full of fine cuts of beef than PRP are with a brand JJ Tesla . DT beef will VB up in price , DT Tesla will VB down . ” On gold , Sinclair says DT ultimate price is an easy - to - calculate math problem . How much gold does America have compared to how much debt PRP has ? So , how high MD gold ultimately VB ? Sinclair says , “ PRP ’s simple math . PRP take DT amount of gold DT U.S. says PRP has , and then PRP take DT debt PRP has , and what price MD PRP need for DT debt to balance to zero ? DT price on DT low end is $ 50,000 per ounce . DT true price is $ 87,500 per ounce . ” Is a biblical debt jubilee coming to America ? Sinclair says , “ PRP already have jubilees . If PRP do n’t pay your rent , PRP have a jubilee . If PRP do n’t pay your student loan , PRP have a jubilee . If DT payment of your auto insurance is postponed , PRP have a jubilee . PRP ’ve got jubilee after jubilee after jubilee . Keep in mind , CD man ’s jubilee is another man ’s disaster . PRP ’s almost as if DT Bible is correct in terms of economics . RB , keep in mind , DT NNS who are n’t being paid are being hurt very badly . ” Sinclair thinks DT recovery will take a decade or longer , and Sinclair says , “ PRP will be just IN DT period between 1929 up to WWII ( 1941 ) . ” Join Greg Hunter as he goes CD - on - CD with renowned gold expert Jim Sinclair . Sinclair did call back in and VBD his power was knocked out for a short while . He RB added , “ I will give DT re-election of NNP NNP a 50/50 chance . NNP knows what he has to do , and DT is bring DT economy back . If he does DT , Trumps re-election will be a slam dunk . If NNP is not re-elected , DT game board breaks . ” If PRP VBP to VB about Sinclair ’s company WDT he talked about and NN IN gold is finally being brought up out of DT ground , VB to TanGoldCorp.com .

Since September 2018 , 285 measles NNS have been reported in Brooklyn and Queens , mainly in neighborhoods where ultra-Orthodox Jews have chosen to not have their NNS vaccinated . DT Centers for NNP Control and Prevention , VBD IN from Jan. 1 to April 4 , 2019 , 465 individual NNS of measles have been confirmed in CD NNS . This is DT second - highest number of NNS since DT CDC declared measles eliminated in 2000 ; in 2014 , 667 NNS occurred . NNS have still been occurring each NN , often brought into DT NNP NNPS from international travelers . Officials believe DT to be DT cause of DT outbreak in Rockland County , NNP York , where 168 NNS were reported as of April 8 , 2019 . Rockland JJ NN officials issued a ban WDT MD keep unvaccinated NNS out of JJ places , but a judge overruled DT on April 5 . On April 9 , county officials VBD PRP MD appeal . But EX are limits to what NN care providers , JJ NN officials and legislators can do . PRP is crucial to consider both DT power – and DT limits – of potential solutions WDT will provide education , JJ care and protection for DT NN while still upholding principles of informed consent , parental decision - making and sustaining JJ trust . As a professor who researches and teaches NN law , JJ NN law and JJ ethics , I VBP PRP ’s worth clarifying what NNS can or cannot legally do when responding to NNS of communicable NN . DT law recognizes DT right of an individual to refuse JJ interventions . NN law has a strong history of recognizing bodily integrity : Adults can choose whether to accept or reject a proposed JJ intervention , even in instances where JJ NN authorities conclude a NN MD benefit both DT individual and society . DT Supreme Court has recognized parents ’ ability to direct DT care and control of their NNS , including consenting or forgoing JJ treatment for their child except in very specific circumstances . In DT 1905 Jacobson v. Massachusetts case , DT Supreme Court upheld a NN law delegating power to local NN officials mandating IN adults receive CD smallpox NN in DT midst of an epidemic or pay a fine ( about $ 130 today ) . Under DT concept of police power , NNS have a duty to enact laws WDT promote DT NN , safety and welfare of its residents . JJ NN authorities MD offer NNS as a method of prevention , but JJ professionals , JJ NN authorities and even courts MD not legally compel a person to submit to a NN . DT Jacobson decision RB set forth limits on police power , yet subsequent NNS addressing NN mandates discarded these requirements , extending multiple NN mandates to school attendance for NN not in circulation and in DT absence of an epidemic . Deferring to respected scientific consensus as a means to justify forced JJ interventions in DT name of individual benefit and DT JJ good has historically resulted in some of DT most egregious constitutional and human rights atrocities in DT U.S . DT mass forcible sterilization during DT eugenics movement is but CD example . DT history of NN and medicine further demonstrates DT fallibility of commonly accepted JJ knowledge , such as when Bayer introduced heroin as a safe , non-addictive substitute for morphine , or physicians prescribed Bendectin and thalidomide to relieve nausea , only to find these medications resulted in babies born with severe birth defects . DT law is RB quite clear IN JJ NN authorities and law enforcement MD place restrictions on a person ’s individual liberty – including religious liberty – in situations where a person ’s actions pose a direct , immediate and compelling harm to others , such as using venomous snakes in religious worship or asserting a nonexistent “ right ” to use an illegal substance such as marijuana when operating a motor vehicle . In JJ NN law relating to communicable NN , this constitutes a very specific standard : A person must have a present NN , and this person ’s actions must pose a direct threat to others . For example , NN officials MD seek a quarantine order or civil commitment for a person with active tuberculosis who continues to frequent highly populated JJ spaces until DT person is no longer contagious . Even in such a case , NN authorities can offer treatment and limit a person ’s movement to prevent infecting others , but DT law does not permit forcibly medicating a competent person against his will . Accordingly , legal precedent does not support quarantining vast geographic areas of healthy persons who have not been exposed to DT communicable illness , but MD support tailored voluntary isolation and quarantine of persons who have been exposed to , or currently have , DT illness . What NN officials can do to protect NNS DT CDC classifies NNS as CD of DT top 10 JJ NN achievements . DT vast majority ( about 98 % ) of parents across DT U.S. as a whole comply with DT NN law mandated schedule of NNS for their NNS . NNS , IN any other FDA - approved product such as a prescription drug or JJ device , carry a set of risks and benefits . These calculations vary depending on DT NN , its efficacy , safety , potential side effects , DT severity of DT illness DT NN aims to protect against , and DT individual to whom PRP is administered . NN NN and practice similarly evolved with historical mistakes ( DT Cutter incident ) and ongoing disputes about risks and benefits for individual NNS IN NN and anthrax . To promote NN for NNS , NN officials MD offer educational campaigns and set up free clinics for parents to bring their NNS . NN laws MD RB mandate NNS as a condition for school attendance , or require excluding unvaccinated NNS during an active outbreak at their school . However , if NNS offer a religious or nonmedical exemption , courts have been clear IN NN officials and school officials do not have discretion to require DT child ’s parent to identify with an organized religion or reject DT sincerity of DT parent ’s beliefs because this violates DT First Amendment . JJ NN professionals worry IN parents who forgo NN are placing their child and DT community at risk . Some have advocated IN DT NN should step in with coercive measures such as eliminating any nonmedical exemptions for all NNS or intervene by force , such as classifying parents ’ decision as child neglect or seeking a court order to vaccinate DT child . In my opinion , these strategies rely on a distortion of legal precedent , dismiss longstanding authority of parents to make decisions for their NNS , and threaten to undermine an already fractured JJ trust . NNS WDT uphold NN intervention to protect a child by compelling JJ treatment generally require IN DT child has an illness , DT illness is severe and life - threatening , and DT risks and benefits of intervening are assessed . This requires JJ professionals and NN officials to maintain precision in distinguishing whether DT parents are deciding to forgo recommended NNS , or whether PRP are refusing JJ care for a critically ill child . Indeed , a recent case in Chandler , Arizona , demonstrated how a NN of coercion and force MD result in parental fear and refusal to constructively engage with NN officials for even an ill child . NN JJ NN officials have DT duty to protect residents from illness and communicable NN , but these strategies must fall within appropriate legal parameters . Dismissing these legal boundaries or justifying unnecessary force not only undermines fundamental liberties , but in my view fuels parental and community distrust of NN officials and sets back DT ultimate goals of protecting DT NN ."

Doctors at DT hearing blamed online misinformation and discredited NN for scaring parents away from NNS . Mr Lindenberger , who is still a senior in high school , spoke on Tuesday at DT Senate Committee on NNP , Education , Labor and Pensions alongside four doctors who are experts in DT field . He VBD much of his mother 's opposition to routine NNS came from fear PRP MD cause side - effects IN brain damage or NN . In 1998 , a NN by a British doctor Andrew Wakefield incorrectly linked DT MMR ( Measles , mumps and rubella ) NN to NN . His research has since been completely discredited and Mr Wakefield has been struck off - but DT theory has endured within DT JJ anti-vaccination community . • ' Do n't be taken in by social NN NN myths ' All four doctors at Tuesday 's hearing echoed IN EX was "" absolutely no evidence "" WDT exists which supports DT link . This is RB affirmed in JJ Danish research released on Tuesday . DT NN examined 650,000 NNS over 10 NNS and categorically concludes IN MMR does not increase DT risk of NN or trigger PRP in those susceptible . Mr Lindenbenger , doctors and members of Congress at DT hearing all pointed out DT internet fuels DT spread of misinformation .

"" MD be a heck of a discussion everybody MD have , "" he VBD about DT family 's JJ disagreement . NN experts have long warned about DT risk posed by parents who do not vaccinate .

This concept , which is known as herd immunity , offers protection for NNS IN newborns and NNS with auto - immune diseases who are not able to be vaccinated . DT NNP has been battling a number of outbreaks of preventable diseases in recent NNS . Senator Patty Murray , from Washington NN , spoke at DT hearing about a recent measles outbreak in her local Clark County where 70 NNS have been confirmed . Less than 80 % of nursery - age NNS were immunised RB in 2017 - well below DT target rate of about 95 % for herd immunity .

California is CD NN WDT has already cracked down on exemptions , following an outbreak of measles linked to Disneyland in 2015 . Similar outbreaks are not isolated to DT NNP - EX have been increases recorded elsewhere around DT NN . In 2018 , Europe saw three times more measles case than DT NN before .

NNS in DT second group read a paragraph written by a mother describing her child 's infection with measles , and RB looked at pictures of NNS with measles , mumps or rubella . PRP RB read three warnings about why PRP is important to vaccinate kids . NNS in DT third group , which was a comparison group , were asked to read about a subject not related to NNS .

PRP have reached this point kicking and screaming , under great JJ pressure , after clinging for NNS to DT fiction WDT PRP are just JJ utilities and IN NNS can use their pipes for pretty much anything . But now PRP have VBN , for a brief moment at least , against a major NN theorist . Facebook , Apple , YouTube and Spotify have all taken action against Alex Jones . PRP are deathly afraid of being accused of political bias , sometimes for good reason . Both Facebook and Twitter have both grappled with incidents of discrimination against conservatives , which MD have made them gun-shy about banning ( as opposed to shadow - banning ) some folks . But almost in unison , DT tech giants teamed up against Jones , who runs Infowars . Candidate Donald NNP appeared on Jones ' online show in 2015 , and yesterday Jones tweeted a video defense with DT headline : "" EMERGENCY : NNP NNP Must Defend DT First Amendment . "" Facebook VBD PRP has taken down some Jones pages "" for glorifying violence , which violates our graphic violence policy , and using dehumanizing language to describe NNS who are transgender , Muslims and immigrants , which violates our hate speech policies . "" Apple VBD PRP removed DT "" Alex Jones Show "" and other podcasts from iTunes and its podcast app . DT company VBD PRP "" does not tolerate hate speech , and PRP have clear guidelines WDT creators and developers must follow to ensure PRP provide a safe environment for all of our users . "" Google ’s YouTube dropped DT ax on Jones ' channel , telling DT Washington Post IN PRP terminates users who violate "" our policies against hate speech and harassment or our terms prohibiting circumvention of our enforcement measures . "" And Spotify banned Jones altogether after earlier removing some podcasts , telling DT Post : "" PRP take reports of hate content seriously and review any podcast episode or song WDT is flagged by our community . "" I VBP Jones has a lot of fans — remember DT controversy swirling around his interview with Megyn Kelly — but he's RB a guy being sued by Sandy Hook parents for saying IN DT horrible massacre at DT Connecticut school was a hoax . Jones apologized last NN , in careful language , for spreading DT phony Pizzagate NN theory , saying he'd been given inaccurate information . DT ’s not "" conservative . "" DT 's at odds with reality . Jones texted DT Post WDT being banned by DT tech companies was "" a counter - strike against DT JJ awakening . "" "" PRP 've seen a giant yellow journalism campaign with thousands and thousands of articles for weeks , for months misrepresenting what I 've VBN and done to set DT precedent to de-platform me before Big Tech and DT Democratic Party as well as some Republican establishment types move against DT First Amendment in this country as PRP VBP PRP , "" he VBD . Separately , Jones called DT NNP York Times a "" globalist intelligence agency "" and VBD IN DT "" evil , wicked sociopaths "" who work for major NN outlets were teaming up to take down Infowars . I confess I 'd VB to VB how DT four tech companies happened to take action on DT same day . Perhaps PRP concluded EX was safety in numbers . PRP seemed to have an ally in Drudge , whose banner headline was "" APPLE REGULATES HATE . "" But this is just a skirmish . Just recently , Mark Zuckerberg got himself into trouble by saying he saw no reason to ban pages by Holocaust deniers . EX is a fine line between banning hate and bullying on CD hand and censoring controversial political opinions on DT other . These battles will play out in a hyperpartisan political atmosphere . But for now , Apple , Facebook , Google and Spotify have all agreed EX is CD person who falls on DT wrong side of DT line ."

This copy MD not be in its final form and MD be updated . ERIC BOLLING , CO - HOST : If PRP only knew what comes on right before DT camera comes up . Hello , everyone . I 'm Eric Bolling along with Kimberly Guilfoyle , Juab Williams , Melissa Francis and Greg Gutfeld . PRP 's 5:00 in NNP York City and this is "" DT Five . "" Well , PRP have some breaking NN on DT NNP transition . Rudy Giuliani is out of consideration for an administration position . PRP 're VBG to hear from DT former mayor in a few minutes . But first , this NN comes on a very busy day for NN - elect NNP . Mr. NNP starting off his morning with a face to face meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan at NNP Tower followed by a NN - Out - DT - Vote event in Baton Rouge , and now Mr. NNP is headed to Grand Rapids , Michigan , for DT next step on his thank PRP$ tour kicking off in about a couple hours from now . CD common theme in DT NN - elect speeches , his plan to bring jobs back to America . He doubled down on his promise during a speech in Louisiana this afternoon . Take a listen . DONALD NNP , NNP -ELECT : PRP 's NN to VB help for DT American NNS . PRP 're VBG to VB them into DT labor market and PRP 're VBG to do a great job and PRP 're VBG to make good money . PRP 're VBG to rebuild our country with American hands by American workers . My administration will follow two simple rules . Buy American and hire American . OK ? PRP have so JJ companies right now -- I VBP probably if I MD have VBN a couple of months ago PRP have so JJ companies negotiating to leave , I do n't VB PRP 're negotiating so fast right now . BOLLING : All right KG , He promised to make America great again by bringing jobs back to America and keeping American jobs in America . Seems to be keeping his promise . KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE , CO-HOST : Yes , I love PRP , and RB a perfect location and venue to make this kind of speech to connect with DT NNS , DT forgotten men and women , DT working class NNS WDT wanted someone to hear them and put them back to work and put money in their pockets and food on their table . American cars made by American hands on DT streets across this country . I VBP PRP 's fantastic . This is why NNS joined his movement and carried him into DT White House to try to VB this done . And perfect timing as well , of course , with DT lawsuits now being dropped for DT recount here as well so , PRP 's fantastic . BOLLING : And RB , EX 's an election tomorrow , DT last senate seat is up for gaps tomorrow . Juan , early this morning , Andy Puzder was named or at least tapped to run DT Labor Department . Guy has 75,000 NNS working for him . Seems to me a logical , wise choice to run labor . JUAN WILLIAMS , CO - HOST : So , no problem with DT ladies in bikinis selling hamburgers ? PRP have no problem with this ? BOLLING : So PRP 're talking about DT "" Carl 's Jr. "" "" commercials -- WILLIAMS : Yes , I see a lot of feminist -- BOLLING : PRP 's CD of DT restaurants -- WILLIAMS : Yes , PRP 're not happy . So , but DT real argument is IN this is a guy who at a NN of populist anger about income inequality is opposed to raising DT minimum wage , RB opposed to DT idea IN more Americans should be made eligible to receive overtime pay and wants to do away with DT Obama era regulation . BOLLING : Can I just check PRP on DT NN . BOLLING : Andy Puzder supports NN NNP . NNP - elect NNP 's minimum wage raises WDT are "" rational and do not destroy jobs or DT businesses supporting them . "" MELISSA FRANCIS , CO - HOST : Well , I VBP DT difference is IN he 's a job creator not a job killer . And IN he realizes IN changing DT federal minimum wage is putting a mandate on employers WDT does n't necessarily make sense . I mean , saying IN he is n't in favor of labor is IN saying IN a general does n't love his troops . I mean he 's a guy WDT goes out RB and expands business , builds PRP bigger . He understands what makes PRP tick . He is highly dependent on labor . I VBP he loves DT guys WDT work for him and he 's a great choice . He understands exactly how business works and how to expand PRP . GREG GUTFELD , CO- HOST : Are PRP talking about Andy Puzder ? DT guy WDT VBD IN if he had his way he MD automate his entire company because robots do n't need NN care , robots do n't sue , robots do n't do DT slip and pay or whatever PRP call PRP ? GUTFELD : Slip and fall -- PRP 're DT lawyer . I tried PRP on PRP and PRP never works . GURFELD : He employs 75,000 NNS , but on DT whole , he MD rather employ none . And by DT way , I VBP PRP 's a great choice . I VBP Puzder is a smart guy . I VBP he is smart on minimum wage . I VBP he 's smart on overtime , but he 's RB smart on DT realities of automation . FRANCIS : He wants to automate . I mean who does n't ? He loves automation , grat . GUTFELD : DT 's my point . So , PRP 're kind of talking out of both sides here . FRANCIS : PRP 're VBG to have no employees at all . No , I 'm not . PRP have to have automation in a business . He wants to keep DT employees WDT he has . GUTFELD : PRP 're pulling away though . PRP 's fast food . FRANCIS : PRP 's productive . Yes , PRP can't stop NN . I mean -- BOLLING : Yes , DT 's my point , PRP can't . But what if PRP decided to punish NN or punish progress ? BOLLING : But he is RB DT guy who is in favor of Donald NNP -- NN - elect NNP 's border policy as well . BOLLING : Where EX are a lot of illegal immigrants who are taking these fast food jobs WDT Americans MD be taking . He promises to implement DT agenda . GUTFELD : I VBP DT 's a relatively JJ thing for Puzder . I VBP Puzder was definitely into cheap labor up until recently . BOLLING : Well , I do not VB he 's for cheap labor . I mean , no . GUTFELD : I VBP he was for open borders . WILLIAMS : So , and let me say for all of our talk at this table -- and I 'm worried about your job at DT moment given your position here -- WILLIAMS : I VBP -- let 's ask labor . Let 's ask DT NNS who run DT AFL - CIO . PRP say this man fights workers . This man is hell on workers . BOLLING : Juan , PRP call labor -- big picture labor -- DT 11 million NNS who are in DT unions ? DT 's who PRP call labor ? How about DT other 130 million Americans who are working who are n't unionized who are against everything union ? WILLIAMS : Against everything ( ph ) . I do n't VB DT 's true . I VBP what PRP 're saying true , is EX are fewer and fewer Americans who are in unions from DT private sector -- BOLLING : PRP 's 11 million . PRP VBP , DT 's 53 million workforce . WILLIAMS : Because , look , wages have been VBG down . NNS are struggling at times for jobs -- WILLIAMS : No , but what I 'm telling PRP is , big labor is not stupid . This is IN DT attack on Chuck Jones DT other day by NNP . BOLLING : Big labor is stupid . PRP are pricing themselves out of DT market . GUILFOYLE : Yes , PRP are . GUILFOYLE : Because PRP 're greedy and yes , when PRP are in a party pig IN DT . GUTFELD : But PRP VBP what ? DT choice of Puzder is telling PRP what DT future is . DT future is automation . So all of this stuff about saving 1,000 jobs here and 1,000 RB , PRP 's not VBG to stop automation , well , DT 's artificial intelligence . PRP 's not . FRANCIS : No , but can I tell PRP what DT difference is though ? DT automated factory is VBG to stay here because when PRP comes down to where PRP VBP to have their factory -- I mean , of course , CEO 's MD rather have PRP here . PRP can keep a closer eye on production . PRP VBP IN DT workers WDT are RB are more efficient , are better . PRP need lower cost regulation , lower taxes , cheaper NN because PRP are drill , drill , drill . And PRP 'd rather have DT factory here . Yes , DT factory is VBG to have fewer workers but PRP need some workers to run alongside those robots . FRANCIS : But PRP MD be better than having DT factories in NNP where PRP can't keep an eye on PRP where a bunch of products are so much -- GUTFELD : So PRP MD say PRP 's okay to apply tariffs to a company to keep them from VBG to NNP ? FRANCIS : No , I VBP DT 's he 's opening salvo and then negotiation . I VBP he 's saying PRP 're VBG to throw this tariff on and I VBP IN DT 's how PRP reset DT negotiation . I do n't believe PRP MD ever come to DT or he MD actually do DT . But if God knows IN PRP 's VBG to , do n't tell anyone ( inaudible ) IN he 's not VBG to actually do DT but I VBP he is . BOLLING : And DT Carrier deal , DT was a threat , but I 'm not sure IN PRP stayed or these jobs -- DT 800 stayed because of DT . I VBP PRP was because PRP was a good deal to stay tax - wise . PRP got tax breaks . PRP got incentives . PRP got investment and if -- WILLIAMS : What did Sarah Palin call PRP ? Crony capitalism . BOLLING : And she was right . WILLIAMS : What did George Will say ? Socialism . BOLLING : I MD say George Will is completely off his game . I VBP George Will at DT NN was -- GUTFELD : Why ? PRP can't say DT . He 's right . He 's talking about DT ( inaudible ) of free market principal . BOLLING : DT free market principals say if PRP lower taxes , more corporations will hire more NNS . GUTFELD : Yes . But then PRP do n't need coercion to VB along with DT . PRP 're saying lower taxes as DT carrot for DT stick . BOLLING : But he never -- he has n't coerced anyone . He 's not even NN yet . He can't coerce anyone at all . GUTFELD : So he never brought up 35 percent tariff ? BOLLING : He brought PRP up and he did n't coerce . What he did was secure -- GUTFELD : DT 's a threat . He did say PRP was a threat . BOLLING : Right . He secured millions of dollars of tax incentives . DT is what -- WILLIAMS : And Carrier secured millions of dollars of -- BOLLING : Hold on . All right , hold on guys FRANCIS : PRP 's their money , their money . BOLLING : Who is DT governor of Indiana ? WILLIAMS : Why MD n't DT next guy say give me some of DT ? BOLLING : Of course PRP should and hopefully PRP VB PRP . WILLIAMS : This is not a system , an JJ system -- BOLLING : Do this . This is a great idea . WILLIAMS : Eric , this is what PRP call picking winners and losers . FRANCIS : No , PRP 's not . FRANCIS : Why are PRP against companies keeping their own money ? PRP 's not taxpayer money . PRP 's Carrier 's money -- WILLIAMS : Oh , well , VB for PRP . Well , then PRP do n't need Indiana 's money ? WILLIAMS : Why are PRP asking for Indiana 's money ? FRANCIS : PRP 's their money . PRP earn profits for giving less of PRP to DT NN . GUILFOYLE : OK , business 101 during DT break . BOLLING : OK , let 's do this . As PRP mentioned earlier , former NNP York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has removed his name from consideration for a position in DT NNP administration , even though he is no longer a contender for a cabinet position . DT transition team says Giuliani MD join DT team at a later date . Giuliani spoke about PRP moments ago . RUDY GIULIANI , FORMER NNP YORK CITY MAYOR : My desire to be in DT cabinet was great , but PRP was n't RB great . And he had a lot of terrific candidates and I thought I MD play a better role being on DT outside . DT was DT only NN I had any real interest in . BOLLING : So , PRP bring PRP around KG . Rudy VBD -- DT former mayor says he pulled himself out of contention . What do PRP VB ? GUILFOYLE : And he did DT on DT 29th . Removed himself from contention and wrote a letter IN PRP did not VB to accept at first because PRP still wanted to keep him in consideration . He always VBD IN he MD be RB for this candidate , for NN - elect NNP . He was . He was a very important surrogate on his behalf and very loyal . I 'm sure he 's VBG to continue very strongly to be an adviser . Anyone MD be lucky to have Rudy Giuliani in any capacity . EX are a number of roles he MD have fulfilled beautifully in DT cabinet so , PRP VBP . Obviously , I 'd love to see him serving DT country but he's got a very busy life , very active life and with his wife , Judith . So , he 's got a lot of options . Let 's see what happens . BOLLING : What about deputy ? No NN wants to be DT deputy ? GUTFELD : Yes , nobody wants to be DT deputy . PRP all VBP to be DT sheriff . Is DT how PRP works ? But anyway , he 's a great guy . He 's IN our Churchill in a way . I mean , he was an inspiring person . I hate to say was but I feel IN he 's retiring and he 's pulling back . But he can still be CD lucky guy at outnumbered . GUTFELD : He will be back here . GUILFOYLE : Well , he just got an award in Colombia for reducing crime RB just last night . I mean , PRP VBP , he 's incredibly talented . BOLLING : This is an important point . He does very -- his security company does very well internationally advising foreign NNS on security . FRANCIS : Maybe DT MD have been CD of DT challenges . I mean , DT 's CD of DT things WDT a lot of NNS talk about , is IN in DT process of a confirmation , IN he has a lot of interests all around DT NN WDT MD have been a challenge . He 's America 's mayor . PRP love him . What are PRP VBG to do ? GUILFOYLE : But he RB was thoroughly vetted so , DT process already was completed . BOLLING : What do PRP make of all this ? GUILFOYLE : Well , I do n't buy IN he was fairly vetted . But I do buy this , DT -- GUILFOYLE : He VBD PRP in DT interview . WILLIAMS : I VBP , well , I MD say PRP , too . But I do n't VB if PRP 's true . But I 'm just saying , I VBP Rudy Giuliani MD have been a great attorney general . I VBP in fact , he might have done better than Jeff Sessions , DT senator from Alabama in terms of getting through . But what strikes me is he was held on a string . If PRP remember , when PRP started these conversations , everybody assumed he was VBG to VB DT job . PRP do n't VB if he 's qualified . Does n't have a lot of foreign policy experience . But PRP was assumed he 's VBG to VB DT job . Then PRP starts to VB Romney , Petraeus , Senator Corker and maybe he got tired of this game . I mean , he makes a lot of money now VBG overseas doing DT things Kimberly was talking about , giving speeches . BOLLING : All right . PRP VBP PRP to leave PRP right RB . A programming note , tune in to Fox NNP Sunday for an exclusive interview with NN - elect Donald NNP . Check your local listings . But up next here , disturbing JJ details about this illegal immigrant on DT run after -- on DT run , I 'm sorry , after allegedly killing two women in Kentucky . How Mr. NNP 's tough immigration stance might fix problems IN this when PRP come right back . GUILFOYLE : Is this DT exact problem Mr. NNP is trying to fix ? This man PRP see on your screen , an illegal immigrant from Mexico is wanted for allegedly killing two NNS in a hit and run case in Kentucky . Guess what ? He has been deported eight times . At his thank PRP$ tour stop in Iowa last night , NN - elect Donald NNP reiterated his campaign pledge to build a border wall and crack down on illegal immigration . NNP : On immigration , PRP will build DT wall and PRP will put an end to illegal immigration and stop DT drugs from pouring into our country . DT drugs are pouring into our country , poisoning our youth and plenty of other NNS . A NNP administration will stop DT violence WDT is spilling across our border . And believe me , PRP 've seen now , PRP is unbelievable how much EX is . GUILFOYLE : OK , so a strong messaging but this is consistent , Melissa , with during DT campaign , what he talked about , cracking down on illegal immigration , cracking down on sanctuary cities WDT MD have these NNS come in , revolving doors to come in to re-offend as criminal recidivist , much IN this man did , and then deported eight times . What an insufficient broken system . FRANCIS : Yes . No , I mean , this has become DT issue . Of course , EX are so JJ cities saying PRP 're VBG to be sanctuary cities here in NNP York . Mayor de Blasio having a commercial in DT back of taxis talking about how proud he is IN he 's refusing to cooperate with DT feds . I heard Greg say PRP before and PRP was so right , IN DT wall is IN DT red shiny bike under DT Christmas tree , and God help him if DT kids come down in DT morning for Christmas and DT bike is n't RB . I mean , this is something WDT if he fails on this campaign promise , PRP 's really tough . At DT same NN , when NNS are so literal with DT wall -- I mean he RB VBD -- remember every NN he VBD DT big beautiful wall , he VBD with a giant beautiful door in DT middle , UH , do PRP really VB EX 's VBG to be a giant door in DT middle ? I do n't VB PRP 's quite as literal . IN a giant -- PRP 's VBG to swing open -- FRANCIS : A giant brass knob on DT big door and PRP open PRP up and PRP follow through ? GUTFELD : EX 's VBG to be a doggie door too for Jasper . FRANCIS : I do n't VB PRP 's quite as literal , but I agree with Greg IN if PRP does n't happen , yikes . BOLLING : I VBP PRP 's literal . I VBP he means what he says . FRANCIS : With a big door ? Is EX a knocker ? BOLLING : No , no , no . I VBP he will build a wall . I mean , this is a brilliant idea . Not only to fulfill a campaign promise , but PRP RB -- PRP 's a massive infrastructure . PRP VBP to talk about trade and -- BOLLING : PRP 's a massive infrastructure program WDT PRP MD put a lot of NNS to work . And IN he VBD , PRP 're putting ways to make Mexico pay for PRP . Can PRP be a little ( inaudible ) down ( inaudible ) . Here 's an interesting opportunity for Andy Puzder to do something WDT Republicans have n't been able to do or are n't willing to do -- is to VB after DT companies who employ illegals as well . BOLLING : Not only deport illegals when PRP catch them or put DT wall up , but if a company IN a fast food restaurant is employing illegal aliens , PRP penalize them . PRP make them pay for DT . Now , this has not been a very conservative talking point , but I VBP Andy Puzder is DT guy . If he is VBG do PRP , boy , this MD be an opportunity to do PRP . GUILFOYLE : Pretty exciting . OK , Juan , are PRP recovering from Bolling 's comments yet ? WILLIAMS : Well , I just VBP -- I really appreciate IN PRP should n't take him literally on DT wall . EX might be a door . I VBP he VBD in some areas EX might be a fence . PRP 'll VB to PRP . I mean , I just VBP , look , this is a waste of money , waste of NN . If PRP 're looking for jobs , Eric , EX 's so much WDT PRP need in terms of infrastructure in DT country . I MD hope IN PRP can do other more meaningful projects . But what concerns me , Kimberly , DT demonization of all illegal aliens because of DT crimes committed by this CD man . He has been deported several times . I VBP DT case WDT Bill O'Reilly talks about all DT NN in San Francisco is even a better example because DT guy just freshly got out of jail . But PRP can't , PRP seems to me , connect crime and illegal immigrants in any significant way because , in fact , crime has gone down . Violent crime has gone down even when immigration -- illegal immigration is VBG up . BOLLING : DT incidence of violent crimes is higher among DT illegal -- WILLIAMS : DT 's not true . DT 's absolutely not true . BOLLING : According to DT FBI in -- WILLIAMS : No , no . What DT FBI says is PRP have more illegal immigrant -- I VBP its 37 percent illegal immigrants in jail . WILLIAMS : But PRP VBP why PRP 're in jail , Eric ? Not violent crime . PRP 're in for immigration violations . BOLLING : PRP commit crimes at a higher rate than DT population . GUILFOYLE : No , no , no . PRP are not in RB for immigration violations . GUTFELD : PRP VBP what amazes me ? Can PRP show DT picture of DT guy ? GUTFELD : What drives me crazy , if PRP take a look at this fellow , illegal alien deported eight times is well fed . He 's just well fed . I mean , if this is how our country operates . He has been deported eight times . DT 's once every six weeks . He gets deported more times than I VBP a haircut . For him it's IN running a 5 k if he actually exercised . So DT problem here is n't just IN he 's an illegal alien . PRP 's IN EX are no consequences for DT incompetence or DT supervisory incompetence . PRP MD not be DT officers . And maybe IN PRP 're told not to stop this , and if PRP 're told not to stop DT , DT has to be addressed . EX has to be a punishment for DT incompetence so IN this does n't happen . BOLLING : PRP are told not to stop this . PRP are sanctuary city . GUILFOYLE : PRP is . PRP 's a hundred percent to -- I 'm telling PRP . I lived RB . I worked RB . I rented ( ph ) RB and I 'm telling PRP IN PRP 'd VB in as a prosecutor into court and PRP MD be DT bad guy . DT prosecutor of DT White House is a bad guy because he MD ask DT person on DT other side of DT table RB to please identify yourself by your true name . And PRP MD give PRP about 16 different aliases , lie about everything . PRP 'd have to run them through DT print system . Find out PRP have a hold . And then DT JJ defender MD just try to VB them out and then specifically not turn them over to NNP so PRP can come back into my courtroom again with another DUI or another criminal offense . PRP are not in DT criminal system for an immigration violation , trust me . WILLIAMS : EX 's any and every community which PRP can find criminality . But let me just say , speaking for big business -- can PRP imagine me speaking for big business ? Big business , U.S. Chamber of Commerce , Mike Bloomberg -- so JJ of DT big corporations from Disney to Marriott ( ph ) are all saying IN if Donald NNP goes ahead with this deportation force , PRP will devastate DT American economy . GUTFEDLD : OK , but PRP 're talking about DT specific examples of criminality and whether DT criminality is worse or better among illegal aliens . If PRP have DT person deported , IN crime is committed , PRP should start calling him DT deportables . GUILFYLE : And here PRP VBP . GUILFOYLE : And just on a quick programming note here , PRP 're unclear as to why DT individual looks well fed . He RB MD have a thyroid issue . GUTFELD : Oh , PRP 'll treat DT . PRP 'll treat DT coming up . GUILFOYLE : Directly ahead , Hillary NNP takes aim at fake NN . PRP 's her warning about spreading false information . Legitimate or just an excuse for losing DT election ? Details , next . WILLIAMS : Welcome back . In her first speech since losing DT election , Hillary NNP is sounding DT alarm about DT dangers of so - called fake NN . This comes after online NN stories involving her campaign sparked some violence . HILLARY NNP , FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE : Fake NN can have real NN consequences . This is n't about politics or partisanship . Lives are at risk . Lives of ordinary NNS just trying to VB about their days to do their jobs . PRP 's imperative IN leaders in both DT private sector and DT JJ sector step up to protect our democracy and innocent lives . WILLIAMS : With recent incidents IN DT Pizzagate incident in Washington , D.C. and most recently in Brooklyn , NNP York , does NNP have a point ? Greg , I VBP to VB to PRP on this because PRP 's not only Hillary NNP . I mean several NNS are increasingly talking about this danger , even DT Pope is saying this is -- GUTFELD : All right , first of all , this is a real story . Forget Hillary . PRP do n't need to hear from her on this because I do n't trust anything she says . Fox NN should be talking about this because this is about NN and this is a serious , serious problem . DT poison of Pizzagate is IN PRP shifted DT burden of proof on to DT accused . If somebody calls PRP a child molester , PRP 's up to them to provide DT proof . PRP can't call PRP -- then PRP 're returning to DT Salem witch trials where PRP take a witch and PRP throw in DT NN , and if she drowns , she 's not a witch . DT 's DT mentality PRP are dealing with on DT internet . PRP now have parents of Sandy Hook NNS getting phone calls and death threats from NNS because PRP believe IN Sandy Hook is a false flag operation . EX has -- PRP are returning to DT McMartin preschool era where PRP just say somebody is a pedophile and PRP ruin their lives . EX has to be consequences for any of these NNS . PRP VBP -- DT FBI should investigating these NNS and PRP should be sued for slander and libel . Do whatever is possible . These small businesses WDT are being abused by these weirdos , PRP need to be able to have some action , some action to VB back at this . I do n't VB Hillary helps because she politicizes this . WILLIAMS : She has a legitimate right to -- GUTFELD : Fox NNP should be talking about this , not Hillary . WILLIAMS : I agree with PRP , but PRP VBP , PRP have NNS who tweet PRP stuff UH , until this story is proven false , PRP 's a story . WILLIAMS : DT 's crazy . DT 's what PRP are saying . Melissa , let me come to PRP . I read a story DT other day WDT indicated this is not just a problem because , PRP VBP , some guy takes a gun into a Ping Pong Pizza in D.C. , but PRP 's a problem because NNS who are just trying to VB what 's VBG on in DT NN VB confused and PRP no longer VBP what 's trustworthy . PRP distorts DT entire NN of NN . FRANCIS : I guess . But I mean , what 's DT remedy ? How do PRP police something IN this ? I mean , I understand DT extreme example . But PRP 's UH , with NNS putting out stories , PRP need some common sense . I mean , I feel UH , when somebody is sharing a story WDT 's ludicrous , I do n't just believe PRP based on IN somebody forwarded PRP in their Twitter or PRP booked PRP in their Facebook . I VBP PRP 're a moron . PRP VBP I mean ? PRP watch PRP and PRP look at PRP , and PRP 're UH , this can't possibly be true . Why -- why MD I believe PRP ? I mean , I just ... GUTFELD : EX 's an entire group of NNS who are pushing a story , pushing a pernicious , toxic story WDT are hurting NNS . EX should be some retribution . WILLIAMS : So Eric , let me come to PRP on this point . In DT story WDT I read , PRP VBD EX are lots of NNS , particularly on DT right -- and I 've heard this from Greg -- who take delight in DT idea IN EX 's someone picking on DT liberals , someone who 's saying PRP 're up to nasty stuff , and so what if PRP 's a little not true ? PRP 're still punching back at DT left . BOLLING : This is a big , big problem . And I VBP DT only solution is Greg is right , have DT legitimate NN services VB out in front of PRP and talk about PRP . And I 'll tell PRP what PRP does do . PRP drives NNS to FOX NNP , CNN , ABC , NBC and stop reading these things WDT randomly pop up . DT problem is , some of them look IN PRP . Some of them ... BOLLING : ... are putting logos WDT look a lot IN ... BOLLING : ... our logos . Of course . But again , free speech , I VBP PRP . But when PRP 're infringing on copyright -- EX 's RB another issue , too . When PRP 're a JJ figure , I VBP PRP forego your rights of being -- of suing for libel and slander . So when PRP 're hitting Hillary NNP , Hillary NNP has some sort of pedophilia thing VBG on with DT pizza - - pizza place in D.C. , she does n't really -- she 's not covered under DT law . But DT average citizen is . BOLLING : DT pizza guy is . He 's not a JJ figure yet , and so he should be . BOLLING : Who do PRP sue ? GUTFELD : PRP have to VB DT names of DT -- PRP found -- PRP found CD woman who was behind DT Pizzagate story who published PRP on her website , finally . BOLLING : Sue DT Internet provider WDT hosts DT story , not DT person WDT posts PRP . Or both . FRANCIS : I mean , I -- I agree with DT sentiment of what PRP 're saying . GUTFELD : IN shouting "" fire "" in a theater . Right ? FRANCIS : PRP 's -- but it's -- realistically , how do PRP deal with this ? I mean , so then PRP VBP after DT Internet provider . I mean , DT 's ... WILLIAMS : PRP 's terrible . Let me -- let me ... FRANCIS : Then PRP 've got to police everything WDT 's VBG on all over DT Internet ? WILLIAMS : I VBP to talk to ... WILLIAMS : I VBP to talk to Ms. Guilfoyle , DT lawyer , if PRP 'll allow me . GUILFOYLE : Yes , DT lawyer . Twenty seconds , DT lawyer . Please . VB to a real lawyer . Not a fake lawyer . WILLIAMS : Will PRP give Ms. Guilfoyle DT table ? WILLIAMS : PRP -- Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook is now asking Facebook users to help him find fake stories . Google says PRP 're VBG to stop placing ads . But "" DT Wall Street Journal "" reported just today , PRP VBD , "" PRP VBP what ? Fake NN is making tens of thousands of dollars because DT big companies do n't VB IN their ads are on these sites . DT computers are automatically placing these ads . And so PRP 're supporting fake NN sites . GUILFOYLE : Right . Well , obviously , PRP have to be a little bit more , PRP VBP , vigilant about researching and vetting DT sites WDT PRP 're involved with and make sure this does n't happen . So PRP has to have a multifaceted approach . Right ? PRP 've got to do this thing . PRP 's IN Jeff [ SIC ] Zuckerberg is doing over RB at Facebook . GUILFOYLE : Mark Zuckerberg is doing over RB to make sure IN PRP 're , in fact , checking PRP all out . Right ? But at DT same NN , NNS RB use some of their common sense to not be fooled by PRP . And on a third note , Hillary NNP is just trying to continue to make and find excuses for why she lost DT election , even though she was a horrible candidate and herself being no stranger to creating fake NN stories , IN when she lied about Benghazi and VBD over DT caskets of four Americans . GUTFELD : Or DT bullets in -- with getting hit by fire . WILLIAMS : I wo n't VB into DT . All right . When PRP come back , JJ questions about conflicts of interest for NNP - elect NNP . This NN , for his ties to "" Celebrity Apprentice . "" Oh , my goodness . Details coming up next . UNIDENTIFIED MALE : A lot of times PRP falls on DT project managers . But , PRP VBP , I did come up with DT jingle , but I VBP to stay here . I VBP to win . DONALD NNP ( R ) , NN -ELECT OF DT NNP NNPS : OK . But PRP wrote DT jingle ? FRANCIS : NNP - elect Donald NNP will not be firing anyone else from NBC's "" Celebrity Apprentice . "" In fact , Mr. NNP is keeping his title as executive producer of DT reality show after he takes office . DT series is returning after a two - NN hiatus , hosted by Arnold Schwarzenegger . In DT meantime , Kellyanne Conway is pushing back against DT hypocrisy of critics who are slamming DT move as a potential conflict of interest . KELLYANNE CONWAY , NNP SENIOR ADVISOR : Were PRP so concerned about DT hours and hours and hours spent on DT golf course of DT current NN ? I mean , presidents have a right to do things in their spare NN or their leisure NN . I mean , nobody objects to DT . Whether it's NNP Obama or Donald NNP , DT idea IN these men are VBG to be all work and nothing else all DT NN , PRP 's just unrealistic , because PRP 's never happened in our lifetime . FRANCIS : Kimberly , what 's DT potential conflict of interest here ? IN he 's VBG to suddenly start liking "" SNL , "" because PRP 're on DT same network ? GUILFOYLE : EX PRP VBP . Conflict of interest . He 's VBG to have to all of a sudden VB Alec Baldwin is very , very funny . I mean , yes , I VBP PRP 're VBG to check this out legally to make sure IN EX is n't any impropriety . If EX were , then he MD have to not have DT executive producer title . So so far , I VBP this is clean . Maybe perhaps PRP 's somewhat unconventional . But PRP is not , my dear friend , illegal . FRANCIS : See , I VBP this is a decoy . This is IN DT shiny ball WDT he , PRP VBP , holds up in front of DT crowd to distract PRP . Because PRP does n't make any sense to be talking about this necessarily . I mean , executive producer , PRP 's IN a candy WDT PRP give out now to actors when PRP 're not really -- PRP VBP , I mean ... BOLLING : DT 's DT point . I do n't VB JJ NNS understand what DT means . DT does n't mean he 's VBG to be on DT phone VBG , "" Yes , I VBP to see this activity VBG on . "" BOLLING : No . PRP slap "" executive producer "" on almost everything . Watch a movie . At DT end of a movie , when DT credits start to roll ... BOLLING : Yes , EX 's 15 . And , PRP VBP , most of them are DT ones who donated to DT film . So I see nothing wrong with this . PRP 's intellectual property . He developed DT show . GUILFOYLE : CD or two . BOLLING : PRP was created prior to ever announcing he wanted to run for NN . Barack Obama wrote a book before he was NN . If DT book was made into a movie , PRP MD be DT exact same thing . No NN MD ask him to take his name off ... WILLIAMS : What happened to DT profits from DT last book Obama did ? FRANCIS : PRP do n't VB he 's getting paid for this , though . PRP do n't VB he 's getting paid . WILLIAMS : So here 's DT -- here 's DT ... WILLIAMS : Well , PRP do VB IN he 's made millions already . FRANCIS : Yes , but PRP do n't VB he 's VBG to VB paid this NN . WILLIAMS : Let me say DT problem here -- I 'm amazed IN PRP guys do n't see DT problem of DT potential for DT chief executive of DT NNP NNPS taking a paycheck not from DT American NNS . FRANCIS : PRP do n't VB he 's getting paid . BOLLING : PRP do n't VB DT . WILLIAMS : Or taking credit , having an interest -- Kellyanne Conway says he 's VBG to be spending NN on this . I do n't VB DT 's legit . And I VBP IN when PRP look at DT idea IN , PRP VBP , he stands RB and says , PRP VBP , "" I have spare NN . I 'll do this . "" What if he says , PRP VBP , "" I do n't VB if I 'm VBG to do an interview with NBC , because I VBP a better NN slot for ' DT Apprentice ' "" ? DT 's a conflict of interest . Is n't PRP ? By definition . FRANCIS : Greg , are n't PRP DT executive producer of this program ? GUTFELD : Little known fact , yes . FRANCIS : I had no idea . What is your opinion on this ? GUTFELD : My opinion is , forget conflict of interest . Make PRP a conflict of interest . PRP VBP , if PRP win "" DT Apprentice , "" PRP VBP -- your apprenticeship is in NN . PRP VBP a job on DT cabinet . If PRP lose , PRP VBP to Gitmo . And everybody who loses goes to Gitmo , because Gitmo is awesome . BOLLING : Geraldo 's right RB . Just when PRP VBD DT , Geraldo ... GUILFOYLE : Geraldo is VBG to Gitmo ? GUILFOYLE : Geraldo , thank PRP for DT chocolates . GUTFELD : ... Newt was on "" Cavuto "" earlier , and I VBP Newt , because he always says DT honest thing . He just goes , "" PRP 's weird . "" Did n't he say , UH , "" PRP 's weird "" ? He was RP , "" Why MD he care ? Why MD he VB PRP ? "" He gets -- he asks everything . GUILFOYLE : EX 's a reason behind PRP . FRANCIS : I VBP . DT 's why I VBP PRP 's a decoy . BOLLING : He developed DT show . PRP 's near and dear to his heart . GUILFOYLE : This is his other baby . BOLLING : His kids were involved in developing DT show . BOLLING : PRP MD be UH ... GUILFOYLE : I VBP he thinks Arnold is VBG to do well . BOLLING : ... MD PRP VB to take -- MD PRP VB to take your book away from PRP , your name and rights to DT book , if PRP became NN . WILLIAMS : By DT way , he 's having a NN conference next week , I VBP on next Thursday . WILLIAMS : NNP is VBG to have a NN conference , which he has n't done - - has n't had CD since Hillary NNP . FRANCIS : He does n't need to . He won . WILLIAMS : He should n't talk to DT American NNS and DT press ? GUTFELD : PRP 's an interesting problem to have . This is DT first pop culture NN . GUTFELD : DT first NN WDT came directly from entertainment . GUTFELD : This is a JJ problem . GUILFOYLE : So truth in advertising and therefore ... FRANCIS : Greg will be DT next NN . FRANCIS : All right . Do n't VB anywhere . "" Facebook Friday "" is up next . GUTFELD : Yes . "" Facebook Friday , "" your questions answered . This is a great NN . I 'm VBG to start with PRP , Kimberly , VB around . GUTFELD : From Michelle K. : "" In memory of John Glenn , MD any of PRP VB to VB to space and why ? "" GUTFELD : Nope . Any -- any reason why ? GUILFOYLE : Because PRP MD be really tough to catch all DT salami upside down . GUILFOYLE : Bad hair . I do n't VB . DT kind of scares me a little bit , to be honest . GUTFELD : Yes . What about PRP , Juan ? I bet PRP 'd VB . WILLIAMS : I 'd love to VB . PRP VBP , I 'm curious about this tourism business ... WILLIAMS : ... because PRP seems a little extreme . But if PRP really are VBG to do something , DT MD be cool . UH , DT other day Steven Hawkins VBD PRP 're VBG to have to find a JJ NN in 1,000 NNS , because PRP 're VBG to use this NN up . Especially with NNP as NN , doing away with DT EPA . GUTFELD : Way to work DT in RB . WILLIAMS : So I MD , yes . But DT other reason is because I love movies . Right ? WILLIAMS : So I VBP Sigourney Weaver 's probably up RB with DT aliens . Right ? And Jodi Foster , did n't she do "" Contact "" ? WILLIAMS : Yes , so I MD VB -- EX 's nice NNS in space . GUTFELD : I do n't VB Jodi MD be into PRP , though . BOLLING : I do n't VB so either . So apparently , Elon Musk says in 10 NNS , he 'll have a space station ...

I MD -- Spritle and Chim - Chim and racing Racer X in DT Mach 5 when PRP MD leap canyons . GUTFELD : PRP MD . PRP was pretty impressive . BOLLING : I VBP to be Speed Racer . WILLIAMS : I VBP PRP saw DT child in PRP . DT 's wonderful . FRANCIS : I am officially terrified . I MD rather lay on DT beach . FRANCIS : MD PRP join me laying on DT beach ? PRP can do DT together . Nice sand ... GUTFELD : But -- but DT 's DT beauty . If PRP lay on DT beach , technically PRP are in space . PRP are on a spaceship , NNP . PRP are throating in space . GUTFELD : PRP are flying through space right now . Probably in a tiny spaceship , compared to a lot of other ones . DT other issue is pooping . GUTFELD : Not having DT . I do n't VB how PRP do DT in space . I mean , VB about DT problems . GUTFELD : NNS have thought about PRP . How do PRP -- PRP VBP , things happen . PRP 's floating over RB .

And these tiny little buttons WDT PRP put ... GUTFELD : Were PRP dancing with yourself ? FRANCIS : I 'd put them on my teddy bear , which is , UH , a kind of mixed up , scary thing . BOLLING : ... which a lot of guys did . But my mom let me have PRP . But PRP had to be in DT closet . PRP was n't allowed to be on DT walls . PRP was in DT closet . GUILFOYLE : And then PRP married Adrienne , much better looking . BOLLING : Do n't talk about coming in or out of DT closet with DT NN . But I was a huge , huge Rolling Stones and Aerosmith fan . So anything Stones or Aerosmith went up on my walls . BOLLING : Or DT Who . GUTFELD : What about PRP ? WILLIAMS : PRP VBP , I -- PRP VBP , my dad is involved with boxing . I love boxing , so PRP 's odd characters IN Alfredo Benitez , who was just a great boxer . But Ali . PRP VBP , I just VBP boxers . GUILFOYLE : Yes , yes . CD NN I got this magazine .

And he sang to me . He has a beautiful voice . GUTFELD : Wow . I used to have -- I used to have posters ... GUTFELD : ... of Lancelot Link , which was a money dressed as a detective . But I had posters underneath PRP . So DT was DT whole key . Is PRP always had posters WDT hid other posters so your parents never knew what PRP were really looking at . GUILFOYLE : And what posters do PRP have , now ? FRANCIS : No , no . Do n't ask DT . GUTFELD : I do n't VB PRP VBP to VB . All right . Start with PRP , Eric .

This_DT article_NN originally_RB appeared_VBD on_IN The_DT Memo_NNP","This article is more than 3 NNS old . Bullshit , James Ball tells me , can VB PRP into DT Oval Office . DT former Guardian journalist and now special correspondent at BuzzFeed is well versed in separating fact from fiction . As a young reporter fresh out of university he started as an intern at WikiLeaks , working on DT verification and publication of confidential NNP documents in 2010 , and then on DT Snowden leaks in 2013 during his NN at DT Guardian . DT ’s all to say he ’s developed a sixth sense for what is , and is n’t , bullshit . With this in mind , today Ball is publishing his debut book as a solo author on DT fake NN phenomenon which has engulfed DT NN of politics over DT last NN . PRP sat down with Ball to find out how half - truths , untruths and outright fakery took over : Fake NN , post - truths and bullshit , is this a JJ phenomenon ? This definitely is n't JJ : newspapers have run questionable stories for as long as PRP 've existed , and fake NN has circulated DT web for just as long . But things have changed a bit – fake NN got political last NN , because DT was DT way to VB huge audiences . So PRP 's some old trends WDT have suddenly really come to DT fore . So who 's to blame for fake NN ? Russia ! More seriously – all of PRP . Fake NN is just DT most visible bit of what is a whole ecosystem of half - truths , untruths and outright fakery , or in other words , of bullshit . When PRP share a story without thinking about PRP or checking , PRP 're part of DT system . When a hyper - partisan NN site ( VB Breitbart or DT Canary ) over - hypes and spins a kernel of truth into something much bigger , DT 's part of PRP . When mainstream outlets run too - good - to - check stories , PRP 're part of PRP . And when Facebook and others profit off this whole system , PRP 're part of PRP too . Are EX examples of fake NN causing real harm ? DT Pizzagate NN – an alt - right theory IN pizza parlours were harbouring secret child abuse sites used by leading democrats – led to an armed man storming a DC pizza parlour . So DT consequences of this stuff can be very real . Polling shows Republicans believe Obama wiretapped NNP ( EX 's no evidence he did ) , while JJ Democrats believe NNP election machines themselves were hacked ( EX 's no evidence of this either ) . When PRP all believe different facts , PRP can't have a JJ conversation – PRP can only have a shouting match . So what 's DT solution ? Will PRP ever be free of fake NN ? DT upside of all of PRP being part of DT problem is IN PRP can all be part of DT solution . PRP need to find ways to make corrections reach as JJ NNS as DT initial bad reports and hoaxes do . PRP 've got to find JJ ways to cover politicians and campaigns which deploy bullshit to win . EX 's no CD big fix , but EX 's lots of little things all of PRP can do . DT fightback can start whenever PRP VBP . Post - Truth : How Bullshit Conquered DT NNP is available now on Kindle and in paperback . This article originally appeared on DT Memo"

When PRP read this post , just remember IN a pedophile is defined as an adult with “ sexual fondness for and activity ” with NNS , i.e. , minors below DT age of consent . In other words , DT definition does n’t require IN EX be sexual abuse of a child ; sexual attraction to NNS is definitive . DT in turn means IN DT Pentagon employees busted for child porn are pedophiles . Remember DT NN back in April 2010 IN , while DT economy crashed , senior staffers at DT federal NN ’s Securities and Exchange Commission were spending hours surfing pornographic websites on NN - issued computers while PRP were being paid to police DT financial system ? Now comes NN IN employees and contractors of DT Pentagon are buying and watching child porn on DT taxpayers ’ dime . Not only is porn- watching on NN computers illegal , PRP is against DT law for all Americans to purchase and view child pornography . Worse still , some of DT Pentagon child porn creeps have high - level security clearances , which makes them national security hazards because their sexual perversion makes them vulnerable to blackmail . On July 23 , 2010 , Dana Hedgpeth of DT Washington Post reports IN “ Federal investigators have identified about 20 Pentagon employees and contractors accused of buying and downloading online child pornography and in some NNS used their NN - issued computers to view DT illegal material . ” According to a 94 - page report released by DT Defense Department ’s inspector general ’s office , some of those involved possessed top - secret security clearances and worked for such divisions as DT Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , DT National Security Agency ( NSA ) and DT National Reconnaissance Office . Those agencies deal with some of DT NN ’s most sensitive intelligence and defense work . DT number of Pentagon employees investigated was not disclosed in DT report , but a Pentagon spokeswoman VBD DT probe involved about 20 NNS who had an “ affiliation with DT Defense Department ” as full - NN employees , former military members or contractors . Some of those NNS have been prosecuted , and some of their NNS were dropped for lack of evidence . Other NNS remain open . DT NNS are part of a wider probe , Operation Flicker , which was started by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement four NNS ago and which has identified more than 5,000 NNS who subscribed to online child pornography websites . DT NNS detailed in DT JJ report include CD involving an employee of Oracle Corp. who had a top - secret clearance and worked on a contract for DT National Security Agency . DT man subscribed to various child pornography websites and made 21 purchases . After authorities started investigating him , DT report VBD , he attempted to tamper with computers at his office . He was put on administrative leave with pay . He later fled to Libya but was arrested and extradited to DT NNP NNPS . Another case involved a NN employee at DT National Defense University in Norfolk who made two purchases from a child pornography website . He pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography and was sentenced to five NNS in prison . PRP is illegal to access pornography with a NN computer . Five NNS later , DT Boston Globe discovered DT Pentagon still had not investigated as JJ as 1,700 of DT NNS involving employees suspected of child - porn .

On CD side sits intentional ( or actively sought ) information , and on DT other lives seemingly incidental ( or passively received ) information ( see Figure 1 ) . In this section , PRP address DT two ends of this continuum and then discuss DT space in between . Our continuum is based entirely on work in schools and with teachers ; however , a reviewer of earlier drafts of this article pointed PRP to Ross 's ( 1999 ) concept of finding without seeking , which led PRP to Williamson 's ( 1998 ) article , which distinguished incidental information acquisition from purposeful information seeking . These older studies serve to remind PRP IN DT concepts employed here are not JJ , although DT ubiquity , speed , and scale of information encountered in DT age of DT internet is . Educators need to address these challenges , but where are PRP to begin ? As part of DT SHEG ( 2016 ) NN , DT researchers compared DT way students approached judging credibility with DT way professional fact ‐checkers approached DT same tasks ( Wineburg & McGrew , 2016 ) . This is an interesting and important line of research , partly because PRP compares various kinds of readers and reading purposes and partly because PRP grows from an authentic example of adult interaction with text . PRP RB see value in exploring DT relation between identity and information seeking ( Kohnen , in press ) and wonder how schools might design learning environments where students not only learn fact ‐checking skills but RB learn to value facts . DT utility of DT rules for internet searching WDT are currently and commonly taught is suspect given DT range of topics likely addressed in DT upper left quadrant of Figure 2 . When querying settled issues WDT are uncontroversial , DT rules MD make some sense . However , DT issues WDT fall into DT upper left quadrant are often those WDT are most controversial or otherwise unsettled . DT more current DT question is , DT less likely NN is to find peer ‐reviewed research on PRP ; library NNS have described this as DT information cycle . Navigating DT digital floodwaters is perhaps most treacherous when users are in unsettled territory , but if educators are to prepare students for authentic , intentional searching , is n't PRP their responsibility to help students gather information about unsettled topics ? DT high ‐stakes searches should be a high priority for schools , but DT small amount of information ‐seeking instruction currently occurring appears to be almost exclusively focused on preparing students for searches WDT fall into DT upper right quadrant of Figure 2 . Clearly , students should be exposed to what PRP means to search IN an expert and should learn to use specific websites WDT historians , NNS , literary critics , or mathematicians find highly credible . Yet , should this be DT only kind of information ‐seeking instruction WDT students receive ? After all , DT upper left quadrant of Figure 2 ( “ highly important / low preparation ” ) is a place where PRP will all find ourselves at CD point or another in our lives . Questions related to citizenship , personal finance , NN , and consumer decisions MD all fall into this quadrant . Again , based on surveys and conversations with adults of all ages , PRP conclude IN most NNS engage in intentional information seeking of all kinds at CD point or another . Examples from Angela 's perspective are included in Figure 2 for illustrative purposes , and PRP have invited dozens of adults to VB about their recent information ‐seeking endeavors in these terms . PRP hope IN this graphic will help start a conversation about what PRP means to prepare students to be successful in different kinds of searches . In all likelihood , educators will see DT low ‐stakes searches as a low priority for schools ; perhaps teachers might model via a search ‐aloud ( Saul , Kohnen , Newman , & Pearce , 2012 ) how PRP engage in low ‐stakes searches of different kinds , but otherwise these kinds of searches probably demand little curricular space . However , DT internet ‐searching rules imposed by JJ teachers do little to prepare students for DT daily information needs of adults , needs WDT are not primarily academic or even career in nature . In fact , DT banned resources are DT bedrock of JJ of DT searches WDT adults engage in as parents , moviegoers , hobbyists , and so forth ( for more on Wikipedia , see Alvermann , 2017 ) . PRP propose thinking about these needs in terms of two variables : importance ( Is DT information need high or low stakes ? ) and preparation ( How well has your education and / or experience prepared PRP to deal with DT information PRP find ? ; see Figure 2 ) . Searches undertaken in schools appear to be designed to help students succeed in formal academic environments . If DT goal of schools is to prepare students to succeed as academics in training , PRP might make sense to ban Wikipedia ; after all , academics do not usually cite tertiary sources such as Wikipedia in their formal writing . Likewise , perhaps teachers privilege .gov and .edu domain names because PRP associate these domains with an editorial process , and some teachers MD encourage students to VB to DT databases in an attempt to steer them toward peer ‐reviewed resources . PRP appears IN most teachers recognize how difficult navigating DT digital floodwaters is for students and believe IN rules are needed as basic signposts or clues . Yet , these rules do not teach students to assess DT credibility of online information as a nuanced or critical thinking activity . Instead , these inflexible rules mask differences between websites WDT MD have a similar domain name or DT same suffix ; do not account for DT various kinds of information WDT exist online ( e.g. , blogs , newspapers , magazines , commercial product sites , professional and amateur videos ) ; and privilege academic searches over other kinds of information seeking , as PRP discuss next . Since 2009 , PRP have been collecting survey , focus group , and interview data on DT ways WDT students are being taught to access information online . PRP have RB talked informally with teachers as part of other projects WDT take PRP into schools . Our respondents came from urban , suburban , and rural upper elementary , middle , and high school classrooms ( grades 4 – 12 ) in schools in DT U.S. Midwest and Southeast . PRP RB discussed internet searching with a group of college students at a highly selective university ( see Kohnen & Saul , 2017 ) . Based on several hundred responses , DT following trends became apparent : Compounding DT problem , high ‐stakes tests , including NN tests such as those developed by Smarter Balanced and DT Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers , as well as college entrance exams such as DT SAT and ACT , do not currently demand IN students find their own information . Rather , tests are scored on students ' ability to read provided texts and cite relevant details from those texts in a coherent essay WDT answers someone else 's question . In this environment , PRP have even heard principals characterize student curiosity as a potential distraction WDT must be managed . In sum , DT answer to DT question about whether DT curriculum allots space and NN for students ' own queries and curiosities is often no or at least not enough . Since DT Common Core NNP Standards ( National Governors Association Center for Best Practices & Council of Chief NNP School Officers , 2010 ) were unveiled , schools across DT NNP NNPS have devoted more NN to informational and other kinds of nonfiction texts ( see RB DT National Assessment of Educational Progress frameworks , on which DT Common Core 's reading and writing distributions were based ) . However , as noted earlier , these texts are typically teacher selected or curriculum dictated , with little input or effort on DT part of students . Surely , teaching students to read and engage with complex nonfiction is a challenging task , and working with class texts MD be a necessary or effective way to introduce certain skills or engage in whole ‐group discussions . Yet , without NN and space to explore their own questions and curiosities , students have little chance to practice their intentional information ‐seeking skills in personal and motivating contexts . Understandably , teachers express worry IN DT curriculum is already too crowded ; DT unpredictability of student ‐driven information seeking MD feel , in CD teacher 's words , “ just too hard . ” As this list makes clear , DT information sought MD be serious or trivial , uncontested or complex . Because intentional information acquisition implies action ( from finding directions to choosing a diet plan to deciding how to vote ) , PRP RB involves skills : DT skills to seek , find , assess , and comprehend a wide variety of texts ( often in a variety of modalities ) . Curriculum developers have deemed some information important and purposefully ignored other informational needs . For instance , few teachers teach or grade a young person 's ability to follow a baseball team 's efforts , even though PRP MD recognize this effort as useful , engaging , and perhaps even wholesome . At DT other end of DT information –acquisition continuum sits incidental information , DT information WDT PRP are all exposed to on a near ‐constant basis . DT term incidental seems to imply IN information is simply sprayed about and hits some of PRP . This is , to a limited extent , DT case : An airport blasts PRP with television NN , and a YouTube video is available only if CD first watches an advertisement . Other forms of incidental information are targeted based on who PRP is ( e.g. , DT targeted ads and articles WDT pop up on our computer screens ) , where CD lives , or what PRP does . Regardless of why this non‐sought ‐out information comes to PRP , DT amount of incidental information WDT PRP encounter is astounding , as recent studies have estimated ( see Bohn & Short , 2012 ; Short , 2013 ) . Schools have historically sought to ignore incidental information , despite DT fact IN PRP composes a huge proportion of DT information diet . Yet , to bring incidental information and ideas thoughtfully into DT curriculum , educators need to recognize first IN incidental information is , in fact , a fund of knowledge . Until incidental information is recognized as such , educators will not be able to analyze its sources , its effects , or its role in students ' lives . JJ scholars have discussed DT disconnect between home and school literacies , particularly for students whose home cultures do not align with DT culture represented by their school ( e.g. , Heath , 1983 ; Moje , Ciechanowski , & Kramer , 2004 ) . In this same sense , PRP is important to note IN incidental information should be considered a literacy WDT MD or MD not align with school discourse . Imagine DT information WDT students are exposed to as part of their everyday , out ‐of ‐school lives through no seemingly active effort on their part : television and radio programs ; websites WDT happen to be up on a computer or tablet when a student sits down to play or work with PRP ; physical copies of magazines , newspapers , and books in DT home ; and automatic texts or RSS feeds WDT appear on a phone or in an e‐mail inbox . These sources often RB inspire adult conversations WDT students MD join or simply overhear . More important perhaps is DT information picked up in dinnertime conversations or on outings with family members or friends . DT sheer amount of incidental information WDT students are exposed to outside of school MD be a critical component of school success . In studies WDT focused on physical resources , Neuman and Celano ( 2001 ) and Neuman and Moland ( 2016 ) found socioeconomic differences in access to print for very young NNS , with NNS in low ‐income neighborhoods having fewer print resources available . Neuman and Moland coined DT term book deserts to describe DT lack of physical books in areas of concentrated poverty . PRP suspect IN EX MD be similar differences in DT amount of incidental information WDT students are exposed to outside of schools and , surely , differences in DT types and sources of such information , such as DT kinds of books , magazines , and newspapers in DT home ; access to high ‐speed internet and DT technologies to take advantage of PRP ; and adult conversations around incidental information . In other words , experiences with incidental information often help students do better ( or worse ) in schools . DT issue here is CD of alignment . Although DT amount and content of incidental information WDT young NNS are exposed to MD differ across socioeconomic classes , a proposition WDT PRP have not investigated , all residents living in DT NNP NNPS in DT 21st century are exposed to a great deal of incidental information . Yet , when incidental information aligns nicely with DT discourses of school , DT bar for learning JJ information in school is relatively low . However , when DT incidental information to which students are exposed ( perhaps because of class , culture , neighborhood , or other reasons ) is quite different from or at odds with school discourses , DT bar for school success is much higher . VBN differently , experiences with incidental information likely make school harder or easier for students . In contrast to a deficit model of thinking , Moll and colleagues ( e.g. , Moll , 2015 ; Moll , Amanti , Neff , & Gonzalez , 1992 ) focused on resource ‐based pedagogy , a way of teaching WDT builds on what students , families , and communities VBP ( i.e. , their funds of knowledge ) . Inspired by Moll , PRP ask , How might incidental information be considered a fund of knowledge ? How might teachers learn what incidental information makes up DT backdrop of their students ' lives and use this information as a resource for teaching ? From a student perspective and by our own definition of non‐sought ‐out knowledge , DT school curriculum often , if not always , focuses on incidental information . DT curriculum is typically determined by someone else and is presented to students with very little , if any , input on their part . Even when students are in classrooms WDT promote active learning , DT activity is almost always focused on learning predetermined concepts about predetermined topics ; as noted earlier , in JJ schools , very little NN is dedicated to students ' own curiosities and queries . However , CD of DT gifts of an exceptional teacher is DT ability to inspire students to move from passive information acquisition to active , intentional information seeking , often about topics WDT DT students never considered before . Curricular units almost always start with students in a passive role in terms of topic , concept , or information to be learned ; DT is , although PRP MD be engaged in active learning , PRP usually have not selected DT curriculum itself . Yet , through DT guidance of a teacher , students can take an active interest in finding out more . For example , Wendy ( second author ) recently witnessed an upper elementary NN teacher teaching a unit on animals native to DT NN . Inspired by their teacher 's enthusiasm , students eagerly researched a bird and wrote individual entries for a class book on “ what makes native birds cool . ” PRP doubt IN JJ of DT students in this class MD have chosen to seek out bird information on their own prior to their teacher 's invitation , but PRP found her enthusiasm and deep interest in their research irresistible . PRP suggest IN our continuum of information acquisition MD be useful for teachers as PRP VBP about DT curriculum from DT perspective of their students . Engaging students in active learning is not a JJ concept , of course , but DT intentional end of DT continuum is specifically about active seeking , not just activity in terms of classroom talk or movement . Our respect and even love for education was built on DT efforts of influential teachers who inspired PRP to VB to VB more about a topic previously viewed as foreign and perhaps even boring . Although such engagement likely cannot happen for every student during every unit , including more opportunities for active , intentional information seeking on curricular topics is a reasonable goal . Finally , PRP wonder how schools can equip students to recognize and respond appropriately when incidental information is a distraction . Today , adults and NNS alike struggle to manage DT onslaught of incidental information . Incidental information , in DT form of background radio or television programs or DT constant influx of e‐mail and text messages , is ubiquitous . Images of couples staring at screens rather than making conversation and parents pushing NNS on swings while checking their phones have become cliché , but PRP RB represent a frightening reality . Our students today live with a 24 ‐ hour NN cycle WDT must manufacture NN to fill airtime ; JJ RB believe in DT myth of multitasking and attempt to do homework while clicking back and forth among multiple information feeds . Learning to shut down or limit DT flow of incidental information , or at least judge when PRP is worthy of attention , MD be an overlooked 21st ‐century literacy skill ."

Toronto_NNP :_: Whole_JJ SM_NNP Publishing_NN ._. ISBN_NNP ._.","Use of color - coded bandannas in DT gay and BDSM communities DT handkerchief code ( RB known as DT hanky code , DT bandana code , and flagging [ 1 ] ) is a color - coded system , employed usually among DT gay male casual - sex seekers or BDSM practitioners in DT NNP NNPS , Canada , Australia and Europe , to indicate preferred sexual fetishes , what kind of sex PRP are seeking , and whether PRP are a top / dominant or bottom / submissive . Wearing a handkerchief on DT left side of DT body typically indicates PRP is a "" top "" ( CD considered active in DT practice of DT act / fetish indicated by DT color of DT handkerchief ) , while wearing PRP on DT right side of DT body MD indicate CD is a "" bottom "" ( CD considered passive in DT practice of DT act / fetish indicated by DT color of DT handkerchief ) . DT hanky code was widely used in DT 1970s by gay and bisexual men . DT wearing of various colored bandanas around DT neck was common in DT mid- and late - nineteenth century among cowboys , steam railroad engineers , and miners in DT Western NNP NNPS . PRP is thought IN DT wearing of bandanas by gay men originated in San Francisco after DT Gold Rush , when , because of a shortage of women , men dancing with each other in square dances developed a code wherein DT man wearing DT blue bandana took DT male part in DT square dance , and DT man wearing DT red bandana took DT female part ( these bandanas were usually worn around DT arm or hanging from DT belt or in DT back pocket of PRP 's jeans ) . [ 2 ] PRP is thought IN DT modern hanky code started in NNP York City in late 1970 or early 1971 when a journalist for DT Village Voice joked IN instead of simply wearing keys to indicate whether someone was a "" top "" or a "" bottom "" , PRP MD be more efficient to subtly announce their particular sexual focus by wearing different colored hankies . [ 3 ] Other sources attribute DT expansion of DT original red–blue system into today 's code to marketing efforts around 1971 by DT San Francisco department store for erotic merchandise , DT Trading Post , promoting handkerchiefs by printing cards listing DT meanings of various colors . [ 4 ] Alan Selby , founder of Mr. S Leather in San Francisco , claimed IN he created DT first hanky code with his business partners at Leather ' n ' Things in 1972 , when their bandana supplier inadvertently doubled their order and DT expanded code MD help them sell DT extra colors PRP had received . [ 5 ] Bob Damron 's Address Book is RB notable when referencing DT Handkerchief Code . Starting in 1964 , a businessman by DT name of Bob Damron published a book of all DT gay bars he knew from his constant travels across DT NNP NNPS . “ This book fit comfortably in DT palm of your hand , ” a description reads . “ Despite its petite size , this book was an impressive accomplishment . Each CD of DT listings he had visited himself . Every last copy of DT book he sold himself . ” [ 2 ] Bob Damron 's Address Book RB published a yearly chart for DT meaning of each colored hanky under DT title "" COLOR CODES "" . [ 2 ] This table is drawn from Larry Townsend 's DT Leatherman 's Handbook II ( DT 1983 second edition ; DT 1972 first edition did not include this list ) and is generally considered authoritative . Implicit in this list is DT concept of left / right polarity , left as usual indicating DT top , dominant , or active partner ; right DT bottom , submissive , or passive partner . Negotiation with a prospective partner remains important because , as Townsend noted , NNS MD wear hankies of any color "" only because DT idea of DT hankie turns them on "" or "" MD not even VB what PRP means "" . [ 6 ] DT longer lists found on DT web are more elaborate and DT JJ color codes in them are less often used in practice , although some of these colors are offered for sale at LGBT stores along with free cards listing their meanings . While DT hankie code was a semiotic system of sexual advertising popular among DT gay leather community of DT NNP NNPS [ 7 ] , PRP is no longer as popular in DT modern day era . PRP MD be seen as something kinkier to use in gay pornography , or at sex and fetish events IN DT Folsom Street Fair . Social networks MD have replaced DT use of hankies in cruising areas by digitizing DT process . By using online platforms , men who have sex with men ( MSM ) can eliminate harassment and violence WDT PRP MD face in NN . [ 8 ] Social networks for MSM RB allow for sub - groups , and for NNS to list fetishes , and what PRP are looking for , which is where DT replacement of DT need for hankies MD have come from . [ 8 ] Grindr is DT most popular app for MSM who use social networks for cruising , with an average of 1.3 hours per day spent on DT app per user . [ 9 ] • None Jacques , Trevor H. ( 1993 ) .

Putting aside DT fiery debate about whether Kelly and NBC NNP were right to give such primo airtime to a man who has spread dangerous NN theories IN Pizzagate and DT Sandy Hook hoax nonsense , DT question for JJ journalists ahead of last night ’s highly - anticipated “ Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly ” segment was all about how tough Kelly MD prove to be in grilling her controversial subject -- just three weeks into her JJ program , at DT . Given how high DT stakes were as a result of last week ’s JJ outcry , PRP assumes DT editors at NBC NNP were working overtime to make sure DT piece was as tough as possible . And given DT favorable reviews , PRP assumes DT network is happy with DT . -- DT Infowars boss downplayed his relationship with NNP NNP : “ I VBP my influence on NNP is way way lower than what MSM has VBN . ” Kelly : “ Well what kind of access do PRP have ? ” Jones : “ He 's just called sometimes and , PRP VBP , talked about politics or thanked me , stuff IN DT . DT 's PRP . ” -- Ridiculous statement : “ DT NN never covers all DT evil wars PRP ’s promoted . ” Kelly responded , “ DT does n’t excuse what PRP VBD about Newtown , and PRP VBP PRP . ” But really , she coulda / shoulda nailed him on DT “ NN does n’t cover wars ” part . -- This is more IN PRP : “ PRP misstated facts about Chobani and its owner which , PRP MD ’ve found out if PRP just had a reporter do a little shoe - leather reporting -- pick up DT phone , check out DT facts . PRP never MD have had to retract DT or apologize . ” -- “ Do PRP VB of yourself as a journalist ? ” Jones : “ I have some journalists WDT work for me and I do journalistic work and I ’ve broken a lot of big stories and I understand DT basics of PRP . ” If PRP missed PRP last night , PRP can watch DT full clip . Veteran CNN TV critic Brian Lowry : “ [ T ] he piece WDT aired Sunday credibly justified covering DT Infowars phenomenon , which was DT bar WDT "" Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly "" ultimately had to clear . … Moving into a prosecutorial mode WDT was frequently her strength on Fox , Kelly did press him , enlisting a Newtown parent and MSNBC contributor Charlie Sykes to help contextualize DT ‘ toxic paranoia ’ WDT he spreads among his listeners . … Kelly 's handling of DT interview should calm some nerves [ at NBC NNP ] , even if PRP wo n't quiet all DT dissenting voices . ” Our own Jack Shafer : “ [ S ] he took DT mendacious Jones apart in such a textbook manner PRP had to wonder what all DT shouting had been about . … Short of waterboarding him , I do n’t VB what more Kelly MD have done to expose Jones ’ dark methods . ” TIPS AND COMMENTS : / . Morning NN is edited by Alex Weprin ( / ) and produced with writing / reporting help from Cristiano Lima ( / ) . Archives . Subscribe . EXCERPT - From my feature this morning , “ DT Not - So - Bitter Rivalry of Dean Baquet and Marty Baron , ” over at POLITICO Magazine : “ Baron and Baquet are DT two most important newspaper editors in America right now , at a NN when DT NN is tackling DT most epic and consequential story of DT past 40 NNS . … JJ NN organizations have been moving DT needle on DT NNP story in different ways … But when PRP comes to inside reports from intelligence and national security agencies , DT Times and DT Post , with their expanding rosters of veteran correspondents , have DT greatest institutional advantages . In particular , DT investigations into whether DT NNP team colluded with Russia in DT 2016 election have played to DT historic strengths of both newspapers . … DT result has been a resurgence of ink-stained combat WDT makes NYT v. WaPo DT most compelling journalistic rivalry since DT days of Baquet and Baron ’s respective forefathers , Abe Rosenthal and Ben Bradlee . DT other thing WDT makes DT rivalry compelling is IN unlike Rosenthal and Bradlee , who were cordial at most , Baron and Baquet are legit pals . ... “ And yet , looking back on their journeys to DT ivory towers of American journalism , PRP ’s equally clear IN Baron and Baquet have been formidable competitors , if collegial ones , over DT course of their professional lives . Perhaps no two editors ’ careers have overlapped and shadowed CD another so closely . In DT past , PRP ’ve each contended to be DT top editor at DT NNP York Times and to have all DT power and influence WDT goes along with PRP . After decades of ups and downs for both men , Baquet eventually got DT job , but at DT same NN , Baron got DT glory and fame WDT only DT most Herculanean journalistic achievements can confer . Now , their competition defines not only their careers but , to no small degree , DT fate of DT NNP administration . Every morning , each goes to work knowing IN part of what he needs to do DT day is to be better and faster than DT other . ” DT ’s DT nut graph , in a nutshell . PRP can read DT rest . ( PRP ’s long , so I wo n’t be offended if PRP bookmark and save for later . ) SIDENOTE : SOME POST NUMBERS WDT SURFACED IN MY REPORTING - “ A person with knowledge of company finances VBD DT Post now has more than 900,000 digital - only subscribers at three monthly access levels — $ 3.99 , $ 9.99 and $ 14.99 — with DT majority of its customers registered at DT higher two tiers . Based on those numbers , digital subscriptions MD theoretically be in DT ballpark of $ 100 million at this point . ( In 2016 , digital circulation at DT Times was $ 232.8 million . ) ... Digital advertising this NN , according to DT person with knowledge of company finances , is projected to be at least $ 120 million , up from roughly $ 100 million in 2016 . ( Digital ad revenue at DT Times in 2016 was $ 208.8 million . ) Since DT Post , as opposed to DT Times , is a private company and does not make its finances NN , PRP MD n’t hurt to take these subscription and revenue numbers with a grain of salt . ” -- “ Watching @megynkelly interview with Alex Jones , I 'm even more convinced IN her piece was n't just ok to do , but important journalism . ” [ ] -- “ Bottom line on NBC's Alex Jones piece : Strong editing gave PRP an edge & made him look IN a kook . Still a win for him ; boosts his profile . ” [ ] -- “ If PRP 're unfamiliar with Alex Jones , and are watching this Megyn Kelly report , hard to imagine PRP walk away believing anything he says . And fwiw , I VBP she 's done about as good as anyone can do on TV taking him to task on JJ of his conspiracies . ” [ ] -- “ PRP MD see DT producers cutting and re-cutting PRP to meet various points of objection . ” [ ] BILL O’REILLY TEASES POSSIBLE ‘ JJ NETWORK ’ - : “ Making DT first stop at his ‘ DT Spin Stops Here ’ tour , O’Reilly ... made some NN during DT question - and - answer period ... Asked whether he planned to start his own network , he VBD ‘ EX MD be a JJ network ’ WDT will compete directly with Fox NNP . ‘ A bunch of NNS are looking to compete with Fox because EX ’s a perception ’ of decline , he VBD . … “ But I am starting my own operation . PRP are VBG to do DT … where PRP will VB into a studio and here PRP will look IN ‘ DT Factor . ’ . . . PRP ’s basically an experiment to see how JJ NNS are VBG to VB this service . DT ’s coming and will be here before September in a robust form . But I suspect EX will be another network maybe merging with PRP . EX will be a network WDT rises up because DT numbers for Fox are VBG down . ” DONALD NNP AND RUPERT MURDOCH , A HISTORY - From DT Guardian over DT weekend : “ DT alliance between Donald NNP and Rupert Murdoch has never been stronger . … Now , with a reported criminal investigation in connection with sexual harassment allegations into Fox NNP , DT stakes are higher than ever for DT two friends . … As NNP ’s ‘ inevitability ’ grew and PRP became clear he was VBG to win DT Republican nomination , DT two men grew closer still , uniting around what is perhaps DT biggest thing PRP have in common : both men love to win , and suddenly PRP were in a position to use CD another to do just DT . ” Sid Blumenthal : “ His entire empire ’s at stake – DT ’s why Murdoch is talking to him every day . PRP ’s not because he enjoys DT sparkling conversation of Donald NNP . ” More : “ ” -- “ Before DT Gunfire in Virginia , a Volatile Home Life in Illinois ” [ ] -- David Remnick : “ Who in DT White House Will Turn Against Donald NNP ” [ ] ERIC BOLLING FOR SENATE ? : “ Fox NNP anchor Eric Bolling MD have just signed a JJ multi- NN contract , but he ’s RB eyeing a possible career NN : A future run for Senate . For now , Bolling is secure in his job as co-host of DT JJ show ‘ DT Fox NNP Specialists . ’ But In a recent telephone interview from Fox NNP headquarters in NNP York City , Bolling VBD IN ‘ when DT lights VBP down on DT TV career ’ he wants to make a primary challenge against a sitting Republican senator in DT South . ‘ A lot of Republicans run as conservatives only to be elected , and PRP find out PRP ’re not conservative at all . ’ … Bolling … declined to specify which NN in DT South he ’d run , which senator he MD challenge or even when PRP MD happen . ” BIG UNIVISION FEATURE FROM JIM RUTENBERG - : “ By now PRP ’ve probably heard IN this is a golden age for journalism -- how DT NNP York Times and DT Washington Post are warring for scoops in ways reminiscent of DT Watergate era ; how an information - hungry NN is sending subscriptions and television NN ratings soaring , reinvigorating journalists and reaffirming their mission … But DT story is n’t complete if PRP does n’t include Univision NNP , CD of DT most striking examples I ’ve seen all NN of a NN organization WDT is meeting DT moment . PRP is DT leading NN source for Hispanics in DT NNP NNPS , citizen and noncitizen alike -- a core audience WDT has an almost existential stake in DT NNP administration ’s policies . ” More : “ ” REVOLVING DOOR : : “ Emma Carmichael , DT editor in chief of Jezebel , announced on Friday IN she 's stepping down from DT position next month . ‘ This has been DT hardest decision of my professional life , but PRP ’s CD I feel clear - headed about — I ’m simply a little burnt out and ready to take a break from running a website , ’ she wrote in a memo to her staff . … Carmichael becomes DT third woman in a leadership position to leave Gizmodo NNP Group in as JJ months . … But DT company has RB made increasing gender diversity a priority . ” -- Margaret Sullivan : “ When student journalists need defending , these lawyers swoop in .

DT singer claims to have recently broken free from DT shackles of her own reprogramming to have a conscious awakening . She recently told members of her inner circle IN she ’s “ woke as f*ck ” and IN she plans on using her status and influence to “ expose DT truth ” . Her latest music video for her single Look What PRP Made Me Do , is riddled with symbols WDT represent pedophilia , Satanism , Reptilians and DT Illuminati . DT lyrics to DT song seem to be a direct response to DT mind control programs used by DT CIA and DT Illuminati to subconsciously push agenda on DT NN . Since its release researchers have been breaking down DT hidden messages in Taylor Swift ’s cryptic campaign , which included VBG dark on social NN , and uploading mysterious clips of snakes . DT corporate - owned mainstream NN has been quick to blast any suggestion of her exposé as nothing more than a “ wild NN theory ” , which is much easier to swallow for DT sleeping masses , but DT message is so blatant , PRP ’s difficult to ignore . Let ’s take a look at her messages WDT DT mass NN desperately does n’t VB PRP to hear . TAYLOR SWIFT IS ABOUT TO REVEAL DT TRUTH ABOUT PIZZAGATE . By now , PRP MD have already seen DT artwork ( pictured above ) for Taylor Swift ’s upcoming album , WDT makes a clear reference to DT Pizzagate / Pedogate Elite pedophile ring scandal . DT newsprint layover represents more than just DT NN at large , according to Twitter user @ ReputationEra17 : “ DT font in # Reputation album cover represents DT font used by most of DT Newspaper i.e NewYork Times and ofc EX is a 10 % shade . # TS6 . ” Taylor Swift is specifically calling out DT lying , liberal , mainstream fake NN machine — DT very NN WDT covered up Pizzagate , DT NN exposed by Wikileaks WDT revealed establishment Democrats ran child trafficking rings in Washington , D.C . DT spiraling triangles in DT video mean globalists are losing control . According to 4 chan , not only is Taylor Swift about to reveal DT realities of Pizzagate , she ’s RB trying to show IN DT globalists are crumbling before our very eyes . At about DT three - minute mark in DT lyric video for “ Look What PRP Made Me Do , ” triangles appear to swirl . DT same pedophile triangle symbol RB quickly flashes up at DT beginning , almost subliminally . Triangles are DT universal symbol for pedophilia , employed by pedophiles Elites across DC and Hollywood to covertly advertise their human - trafficking rings . Or , as 4 chan summarizes : “ Pizzagate is unraveling , and spiraling out of DT globalist ’s control . RB , right after this sequence , DT whole screen flashes yellow for DT first NN . ” Yellow is only used sparingly in this video , and only as a reference to goodness or righteously exercised power . ” DT full - screen worldwide flash of yellow means DT globalists are losing control of their mind control apparatus . ” Their poison cloud is about to dissipate . ” DT imagery has a deeper meaning if PRP VBP what to listen for . PRP ’s more than just DT lyrics WDT have deeper meanings , though . After her feud with failed mind - control puppet Kanye West ensured IN Swift MD be forever linked to DT snake emoji , Swift has clearly decided to reclaim DT imagery . According to CD researcher , Swift “ appropriated DT snake and turned PRP around on them , DT ouroboros eating itself IN DT left does , spiraling around to look IN DT pedo symbol … . Swift ’s desire to expose DT Illuminati in DT mainstream does n’t seem to be a decision she has made lightly though , as she recently confessed to being a long - NN 4 Chan power user , in which she was using DT anonymous message boards to expose dark secrets . DT users of 4 chan have RB compiled evidence IN Taylor Swift posts among them , as shown in DT image above . Rumors of her 4 Chan posting had already begun to swirl following Taylor Swift ’s refusal to speak out during DT presidential campaign . Since Taylor Swift refused to denounce Donald NNP , as JJ other celebrities had , 4 chan assumed this meant IN she simply did n’t VB to hurt album sales by coming out as a NNP supporter . Just listen to DT lyrics . Lyrics paired with DT images in DT video , in particular , send a clear message : During DT chorus , a bunch of Ouroboros with DT line ‘ Look what PRP made me do ’ repeated . DT left is constantly referred to as eating itself = snake eating its tail . Look what PRP made me do , therefore is a response to DT increased radicalization of DT left and DT reactionary politics of T - Swift . ” DT left is constantly referred to as eating itself = snake eating its tail . Look what PRP made me do , therefore is a response to DT increased radicalization of DT left and DT reactionary politics of T - Swift . Taylor Swift seems to be following a trend of celebrities WDT have recently come forward to blow DT whistle on Elite pedophilia . Elija Wood , Brad Pitt , Katy Perry , Corey Feldman , and Robert Downey Jr. are just a few of DT big names WDT have attempted to lift DT lid on DT pedophile networks in DT entertainment industry and political NN . PRP seems as though EX ’s safety in numbers though as more come forward to reveal DT truth ."

Hell_UH no_UH ,_, I_PRP do_VBP n’t_RB ._.","PRP MD seem IN June 2018 culminated a lengthy ritual involving DT sacrificing of 12 well - known celebrities and members of royal families . Whereas this will only be NN to normies , EX has definitely been a lack of coverage on DT occultic aspects of these deaths . PRP MD seem IN DT normies / sheeple of DT NN have not batted an eye at DT fact IN 12 wealthy celebrities have all died in DT same manner in DT past few NNS under very similar and bizarre circumstances . Perhaps this is because DT mainstream NN refuses to report on their connections to elite pedophilia rings which tie directly to powerful NNS in Washington , Hollywood , and DT mainstream NN . NNS on DT last presidential ticket in fact . No . DT mainstream propaganda NN MD have PRP believe DT 12 independent and highly successful NNS with careers and influence hanged themselves on doorknobs . DOORKNOBS !!! My first question is : How DT hell does CD hang themselves from a doorknob ? Followed by : How common is this ? Do NNS hang themselves from doorknobs regularly and I ’m just now finding out about PRP ? Is EX a doorknob suicide club DT rest of PRP are n’t aware of ? Well , DT answer to DT last question is “ yes . ” CD need only substitute DT word “ suicide ” with “ murder . ” Or simply use DT word “ suicide ” in DT past tense while maintaining its usage as a verb . Eg . Hillary NNP opted to have Seth Rich die in a “ botched robbery ” as opposed to having him “ SUICIDED ” PRP VBP DT point . I MD VB DT reader to VB how excruciatingly hard PRP was not to list DT other dozens of NNS who have committed suicide surrounding DT NNP administration dating back to DT Arkansas days . But what does this have to do with “ Doorknob Suicides ” PRP MD ask ? Everything . Pizza Gate , John Podesta ( Hillary ’s campaign manager , child rapist / murder ) , James Alefantis( Restaurant owner front for DC child prostitution ring ) , Henry Weinstein ( Hollywood Rapist ) , Boys Town ( Male Child sex ring catering to politicians ) , Israeli brown - stoning ( Israeli control mechanism for DT U.S. govt , Jerry Sandusky ( Low - level Pedophile who took DT fall ) , Jeffrey Epstein ( child prostitute procurer for DT elite ) , Hunter S Thompson ( Snuff filmmaker ) , DT Catholic Church ( Enough NNP ) . Hillary NNP ( Rapist , murder , Deep NNP Luciferian ) , . None of these murders / sex rings are mutually exclusive . What ’s scarier is , PRP occupy seats of incredible power and operate within DT normalized institutions of Hollywood and Washington while being insulated by NN and pop-culture . DT desire for DT supply of NNS for both pedophile sex rings and ritual sacrifice date back to DT days of monarchy and are alive and flourishing within DT institutions flowing within DT undercurrents of our society today . So why did these 12 NNS die in nearly identical ritual suicides laden with occultic overtones ? Quite simply because PRP were either in DT thick of PRP or had information which MD ’ve exposed those at DT heart of DT pedophile networks . Why Doorknobs ? Why 12 ? Where is DT 13th ? Skip to DT second half of this article for an explaination of ritual mechanics . In order of “ Suiciding ” PRP are as follows : INXS frontman Michael Hutchence ’s body was found hanging from a doorknob in Room 524 at DT Ritz - Carlton hotel in Double Bay , Sydney . DT occupant in DT neighboring room heard an unidentified loud male voice and swearing at around 5 AM ; DT coroner was satisfied IN this was Hutchence arguing with another male . On February 6th , 1998 , after an autopsy and coronial inquest , NNP South Wales NNP Coroner , Derrick Hand , presented his report ruling IN Hutchence ’s death was a suicide . According to reports , Hutchence had information regarding a “ VIP pedophile ring ” in DT UK WDT was connected to child killing rapist Jimmy Saville and high - ranking politicians . PRP should be noted IN this was DT first “ suicide ” of DT 12 and began on DT same day of DT NN JFK was assassinated . November , 22 . Of course , DT reason for this is because 11 / 22 add up to 33 . A numerical masonic / occultic calling card to be sure . Hutchence ’s age RB adds up to 10 or “ 1 ” Visit my numbers NN page for more info on this . Perhaps DT most occultic murder ot them all . Hollywood actor David Carradine was found dead in his room at DT Swissôtel Nai Lert Park Hotel on Wireless Road , near Sukhumvit Road , in central Bangkok , Thailand . He was RB shooting his latest film , titled Stretch . Really ? Stretch ? A police official VBD IN Carradine was found naked , hanging by a rope tied to DT doorknob of DT room ’s closet leading them to believe his death was suicide . However , later reports suggested IN his death was accidental , DT result of autoerotic asphyxiation . Two autopsies were conducted , CD involving DT celebrity pathologist Pornthip Rojanasunan , and both concluded IN DT death was not a suicide . DT cause of death became widely accepted as “ accidental asphyxiation . ” Carradine ’s lawyer Vicki Roberts went on record stating : “ I believe EX MD have been foul play . ” Reports around DT NN of his death suggest IN Carradine MD have been involved in child sex tourism ; a rampant issue in Thailand where he was found . If he was involved in pedophilia , MD he have been connected to a wider network of Hollywood elite pedophiles ? Here PRP have DT almighty “ 72 ” . If ever EX was a more complete and hermetic number for ritual work this is PRP . Of course , what better way throw collective common sense out DT window than to write a sex scandal into DT narrative . “ Death by erotic asphyxiation . ” I ’m calling Bullshit on DT . Was Carradine into DT Pedo scene ? PRP sure seems IN EX are more than a few connections . Unlike other NNS on this list he was n’t in DT process of attempting to out anyone at DT NN of his death . DT first of 3 fashion designers on this list , McQueen was found in DT AM , hanging from a doorknob by his housekeeper at his home in Green Street , London where paramedics pronounced him dead at DT scene . Metropolitan Police stated IN DT note McQueen left was not suspicious , however , PRP did not confirm IN his death was a suicide . Photos of McQueen ’s fashion shows . PRP ’s obvious IN McQueen was in DT thick of PRP and made a regular habit of signaling his allegiance . As an occultist I can tell PRP IN DT attention to detial and themes portraid in his shows were beyond DT of casual decor . PRP ran deep . Tech pioneer , and Reddit co-founder , Aaron Swartz was found dead in his Brooklyn apartment by his partner , Taren Stinebrickner - Kauffman . A spokeswoman for NNP York ’s NNP Examiner reported IN he had hanged himself from a doorknob . No suicide note was found . According to former - CIA agent Robert Steele , Swartz hacked into MIT Computers and found a huge stash of Child Pornography shortly before his death . Another numerologically significant date . Jan , 11th is “ 1/11 ” and this number has a few meanings . first , 111 is 3 “ 1 ’s ” or 3 . Master Mason is DT 3rd degree . PRP is RB DT first 11 of DT NN . 11 symbolizes DT pillars of Boaz and Jachin which sat at DT entrance to King Solomon ’s Temple . 11 is RB DT first number after “ 10 ” which is DT most perfect number and represents ILLUMINATION . ” “ 11 ” represents imperfection in NN because PRP is CD number short of 12 , which symbolizes a perfect theocratic NN . Satanists love to utilize this dystopian number in their ritual work . Of course , DT triple and quadruple “ 1’s ” holds extreme significance in pop culture as a number everyone seems to notice regularly . At first DT numerology surrounding this murder seems a little overkill , no pun intended . 11 is quite a powerful and significant number to utilize when weaving into a ritual . But upon a closer examination of Aaron ’s life , PRP realize IN his death was most certainly to be used as an example to other budding guienses . Although Aaron no doubt more than likely had incriminating files of DT elite pertaining to pedophilia he was RB DT spearhead of a movement to bring and maintain freedom of speech and presence on DT Internet . DT internet HAS replaced TV and IS DT default platform for DT human species at this point . Aaron posed a real threat to this . Our second fashion designer on DT list is L’Wren Scott , long NN lover of Mick Jagger and ( former girlfriend of Nate Rothschild ) was found dead by her assistant at her apartment in DT Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan on March 17 , 2014 . DT police reported IN no note was found and EX was no sign of foul play . DT NNP York City Chief NNP Examiner determined Scott ’s manner and cause of death to be “ suicide by hanging . ” I wonder what sort information concerning DT underbelly of sex , privilage , and decadance DT ex girlfriend of a Rothschild and mega rockstar MD be privy to which MD either put her at jeopardy for elimination or make her VB to kill herself ? And DT fact IN I ’m not buying DT whole “ death by doorknob suicide ” Bullshit , I ’m guessing she was silenced . Williams died at his home in Paradise Cay , California . DT initial report released on August 12 , DT Marin County Sheriff ’s Office deputy coroner stated Williams had hanged himself after he was found hanging from a doorknob with a necktie . DT final autopsy report , released in November 2014 , ruled IN Williams had committed suicide by hanging himself from DT doorknob . Neither alcohol nor illegal drugs were involved , while all prescription drugs present in his body were at “ therapeutic ” levels , DT coroner declared . Williams had been a part of DT Hollywood scene for so long , nearly anything PRP can imagine MD possibly be true . EX ’s a 100 % chance Williams rubbed elbows with everyone in DT Hollywood scene at CD NN or another and was exposed to everything Hollywood had to offer . DT question is : How deep was he into DT scene ? Decades of cocaine and partying can lead to some pretty dark places . He most certainly knew DT dirty secrets of Henry Weinstein and his ilk , but what most NNS forget is IN these celebreties cross over into politics quite often and support DT agendas of democrat canidates regularly . This is where PRP VBP into “ brownstonin . ” Hollywook insider and whistleblower Jon Robberson has chimed in on DT Hollywood pedophile sex rings . He recently madestatements in an interview regarding his belief IN Robin Williams was most likely blackmailed into making DT film Patch Adams . And MD do PRP make DT Family Guy predictive programming which transpired shortly before Robin ’s death ? PRP ’s obvious IN Seth McFarlane has a hand in DT mechanics of these rituals . Cornell was found unconscious by his bodyguard , hanging from DT doorknob in DT bathroom of his hotel room at DT MGM Grand in Detroit , after performing at a show with Soundgarden at DT Fox Theatre on NNP 17 . He was lying on DT floor with an exercise band around his neck and blood in his mouth . An MGM medic and EMS personnel were unable to revive Cornell . Cornell was pronounced dead by a doctor at 1:30 a.m. Police ruled out homicide by reviewing a hotel surveillance video , which showed nobody entering or exiting DT suite after his bodyguard left at around 11:35 p.m . DT cause of death was determined to be “ suicide by hanging . ” Cornell ’s death is surrounded by rumors IN he was about to expose key players in DT DC pedophile ring known as pizza gate . PRP ’s no secret IN Cornell and Chester Bennington , ( Next on this list ) died two months later DT exact same way , had begun an organization to help at - risk NNS . Chester Bennington as PRP will learn is DT son of John Podesta . PRP ca n’t make this stuff up . Several have questioned what PRP say are gaps in DT timeline . DT police report says DT bodyguard was in Cornell ’s hotel room at 11:30 p.m. to help DT star with DT victim ’s “ computer , which was not working at DT NN . ” PRP says Vicky Cornell talked to her husband at 11:35 p.m. , and , alarmed by what she heard , she phoned DT bodyguard to ask him to check on her husband . He told police he went to Cornell ’s room at 12:15 a.m . Some question DT apparent 40 - minute gap between DT start of Vicky ’s conversation with her husband and DT bodyguard ’s welfare check at his room . Assistant Wayne County NNP Examiner Theodore Brown VBD IN upon a visual examination , “ no pills were found in DT stomach , ” according to his report . But EX ’s no indication in DT toxicology report IN Cornell ’s stomach was tested to determine DT level of drugs RB , since only DT blood sample is cited . Cornell RB had nine broken ribs discovered at his autopsy . DT official explanation was IN DT medics broke his ribs trying to resuscitate him using CPR . An indepth article on DT investigation can be found here . Linkin Park ’s Chester Bennington was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates , California ; his housekeeper discovered his body hanging from a doorknob around 9:00 a.m . His death was officially ruled as suicide . On July 21 , Brian Elias , DT chief of operations for DT office of DT JJ examiner - coroner , confirmed IN a half - empty bottle of alcohol was found at DT scene , but no other drugs were present . Believing himself to be a victim of child abuse , Chester Bennington was working with his best friend Cornell to expose a high - reaching child trafficking network . But to say IN Bennington believed himself to be a victim of child abuse is IN stating IN Adolf Hitler was simply a charismatic politician . Good lord this rabbit hole runs deep . DT band ’s logo was a broken version of DT triangle used in pedophile networks . EX is no doubt IN Bennington ’s entire existence was consumed by DT ritualistic sexual abuse he sustained at DT hands of his father John Podesta . What are DT odds WDT two best friends who are about to expose a DC pedophile ring of which CD of DT friend ’s father was at DT heart of died in DT exact same bizarre manner and IN DT second VBP to die did so two months later on his best friend ’s birthday ? EX is no doubt IN Bennington MD ’ve struck at DT heart of this DC pedophile ring more than likely bringing down Podesta , Hillary NNP and their networks . After all he had DT DNA to corroborate his claim . I do n’t VB Bennington knew just how much danger he was in . Swedish DJ Avicii , real name Tim Bergling , died on 20 April 2018 near Muscat , Oman , at DT age of 28 . No cause of death was immediately given . On 21 April , DT Omani police stated IN EX was “ no criminal suspicion ” or evidence of foul play in Bergling ’s death . On 26 April , his family released an open letter stating IN Bergling “ really struggled with thoughts about meaning , life , happiness . He MD not VB on any longer . ” On 1 NNP , TMZ reported IN DT cause of death was a suicide due to self - inflicted injuries . Although full details of his death were not released , TMZ reports IN he suffered cuts from broken glass along with neck injuries . Although PRP is unclear what DT injuries to his neck were , PRP MD have been caused by asphyxiation and hanging has not been ruled out . After his death , PRP emerged IN Avicii was working to expose an elite pedophile ring . CD of his videos began to recirculate in which he attempts to expose child trafficking . In 2015 Avicii did release a video for his song “ For a Better Day ” where he shows child sex tracking taking place and two girls WDT escape from a man trying to capture them . DT video later reveals IN DT two girls seek revenge on DT ‘ elite ’ WDT were running this pedophile operation Did Avicii have DT clout and influence to help wake up an entire generation to DT horrors of institutionalized and ritualistic pedophilia and our JJ governments and institutions ? Or was he simply ritual fodder ? Our third fashion designer on this list is Kate Spade . RB linked to DT Clintons Spade was found dead hanging by DT neck from a doorknob in her Manhattan apartment . PRP is been VBN IN “ buying a Kate Spade handbag was a coming - of - age ritual for a generation of American women . ” PRP ’s obvious DT ’s not DT only ritual VBG on here . A note found at DT scene was addressed in DT Spade ’s 13 - NN - old daughter indicating IN what happened was not DT child ’s fault . Miss Spade ’s entrance into DT dark NN of privilege and decadence was when she met her husband to be , DT brother of actor and comedian David Spade . According to a NNP Foundation DOCUMENT , Kate Spade was among a group WDT traveled to Haiti on behalf of DT NNP Foundation . She was part of DT foundation ’s initiative to foster “ JJ growth , support small businesses , and empower girls and women . ” EX ’s no doubt IN Spade , who seems IN a generally good person came across DT same information regarding DT NNP foundation Haitian child sex trafficking network WDT got Monica Peterson killed by DT Clintons . Most believe IN Klaus Eberwein , a former Haitian NN official was RB “ SUICIDED ” in his Miami motel CD day prior to testifying in court . Eberwein was scheduled to appear Tuesday before DT Haitian Senate ’s Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission . No doubt DT topic of child sex trafficking and DT Clintons was on DT agenda . As a side note . Klaus was RB a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti , Muncheez , and has a pizza — DT Klaus Special — named after him . Chelsea NNP , DT daughter of Bill and Hillary NNP , paid tribute to DT fashion designer via Twitter . “ My grandmother gave me my first Kate Spade bag when I was in college . I still have PRP . Holding Kate ’s family , friends and loved ones in my heart . ” Equally as strange as Kate Spade hanging herself with a red scarf from a doorknob was DT reaction of her husband shortly after DT incident . Two days after Kate hanged herself from a doorknob with a red scarf Andy Spade was videotaped walking around in NN wearing a mouse mask with a red scarf and newspaper hat . PRP was actually DT mask of CD of DT characters from DT classic Disney cartoon DT Avengers . This is some strange behavior which does n’t fit into any box . Who DT hell just happens to have an Avengers mouse mask laying around DT house ? NO !!! In my opinion , this was a JJ self - humiliation ritual . A nod , a message , a signaling of subservience to DT Clintons or whoever had Kate killed IN he understands and will be playing ball . Do PRP even need to mention she was killed at 33 ? Dutch Queen Maxima ’s sister Ines Zorreguieta ( DT only royalty on this list ) was found dead in Argentina last week . Zorreguieta , 33 , was found dead by a friend who discovered her body hanging from a doorknob in her apartment in DT Almagro district of Buenos Aires . Police VBD DT autopsy report MD be available in a week but did not suspect foul play . According to reports , Zorreguieta was connected to high - level elites involved in child trafficking . Queen Maxima stepped down after allegations of her involvement in “ hunts ” where NNS were raped and massacred by her dinner guests . Some speculators believe she MD have been “ silenced ” before she MD VB NN about a cabal - connected pedophile ring . European royalty , especially DT Dutch have a long history of being accused of not only engaging in pedophilia but hunting killing and eating NNS . If PRP ’re a normie this MD seem shocking , but for those of PRP in DT trenches this information is not JJ . David Icke has been screaming from DT rooftops about this for over three decades and PRP ’s just now starting to VB attention . Do your research , then share . At DT height of his career , chef , TV personality , NN traveler and armchair philosopher Anthony Bourdain decided to commit suicide by hanging himself from a doorknob . Because apparently DT ’s just what PRP do when PRP ’re successful and have a great life . Just prior to being “ SUICIDED ” Bourdain tweeted : “ VB what Hillary NNP is NOT ? She ’s not stupid . Or unsophisticated about DT NN . DT Weinstein stories had been out RB for NNS . ” “ Mindless Hillary hate aside , this was a terrible response to questions about a “ friend ” who ’s been tormenting women for decades . ” “ I have met Hillary NNP . I liked her . I admired much about her . This interview was a real disappointment . ” “ Hillary is CLEARLY not responsible for anyting Weinstein . Thats screamingly obvious . Her response to questions though has been uninspiring . ” “.. and I am in no was an HRC fan . I ’ve been on he receiving end of her operatives ’ wrath . And PRP ai n’t fun , ” “ PRP ’s no secret IN NNS who cross DT Clintons wind up dead … mostly from suicide , ” Occultic and ritualistic mechanics surrounding his death include : DT show he was working on was in its 11th season . He died in France which is birthplace of DT Scottish Rite within Freemasonry . Interestingly Bourdain participated in an ancient death ritual and DT season finale of his TV show . parts unknown which aired two weeks after he was suicided . If this is n’t predictive programming I do n’t VB what is . 12 . At first this seems IN a good round number in which to structure a deep NN sanctioned ritualistic murder spree . However , upon second glance EX ’s nothing arbitrary about PRP . PRP has everything to do with , wait for PRP , DT SUN . or DT Son ( Jesus ) or any ancient god which was used at DT NN to represent DT sun through stories and allegories . eg Jesus had 12 disciples , Buddha had 12 followers , Quetzaocoatl had 12 followers , DT 12 nights of DT roundtable , Hercules and his 12 labors , DT 12 tribes of Israel , DT 12 great patriarchs , 12 Old Testament prophets , 12 jewels of DT high priest . And PRP goes on and on . • 12 NNS of childhood before DT “ teens Christianity and Astrotheology aside , these deaths and DT fact IN PRP were for further molded , packaged and deployed as 12 is taken full advantage of DT resonance and occultic meaning behind this number as PRP relates to conscripting of these energies for use in ritual magick . Only in this case is a BLACK SUN RITUAL as this is overly perverted black magick . In his masterpiece , Secret Teachings of All Ages Manly P Hall writes this : DT number twelve frequently occurs among ancient peoples , who in nearly every case had a pantheon consisting of twelve demigods and goddesses presided over by DT Invincible NNP , who was Himself subject to DT Incomprehensible All - Father . This use of DT number twelve is especially noted in DT Jewish and Christian writings . DT twelve prophets , DT twelve patriarchs , DT twelve tribes , and DT twelve Apostles–each group has a certain occult significance , for each refers to DT Divine Duodecimo , or Twelvefold Deity , whose emanations are manifested in DT tangible created Universe through twelve individualized channels . “ DT number 12 was celebrated as a mystical number in DT ancient systems of sun-worship , of which PRP has already been VBN IN Masonry Is a philosophical development . DT number RB referred to DT twelve signs of DT zodiac , and in those Masonic rites in which DT Builder Is made DT symbol of DT sun , DT twelve Fellow Crafts refer to DT twelve signs in which alone DT sun is to be sought for . ” Gnostic teachings tell PRP IN EX is only CD true Square number . 144 . or 12 X 12 = 144 which is pure math harmony both vertically and horizontally . This can easily be seen in music , but RB affects our DNA and how PRP react to “ vibrations . ” REMEMBER physical acts are simply DT vibrational manifestation of thought process in our three - dimensional NN . Our brain is nothing more than a 3 to 4th dimensional interface machine . Ergo… . Practitioners of this magick understand IN physical acts will have a bearing on DT mind VBG DT other way as well . Especially when PRP enacted in traumatic fashion and designed to resonate with natural energies . OR ritualistic magic . But who is DT 13th ? This should be obvious at this point . DT 13th , is DT SUN , GOD , or he who places himself in DT stead of DT Sun , Son , God , Sun-God . Jesus and Buddha were obviously DT 13th . King Arthur was DT 13th . God was DT 13th in regards to DT patriarchs . DT sun is DT 13th after DT 12 constellations in DT zodiac . And on and on . Of course , this has an obvious association with Lucifer ( bringer of light ) who “ wanted to be IN DT most - high . ” What ’s more , this behavior is represented throughout all religion and astrology and is always associated with DT fall or destruction of man . or PRIDE . Lucifers sin . EX is a right and a wrong way to VB about living and seeking knowledge . DT first is to live in harmony with our NN and its laws and energies as PRP has been laid out for PRP . Recognizing IN DT Sun is DT giver of life / our Creator . DT other involves DT attempt to place oneself in DT position of DT Sun and through cleverness , back engineer these natural laws and bend them to PRP ’s own will . For Christians , Lucifer , DT bringer of light or DT bringer of knowledge , is representative of this second path . He represents DT black 13 This ritual is a simple inversion of DT sacred 12 and CD . A perversion of DT natural energies of creation . Instead of DT NN , DT source , DT Sun giving life ; PRP is extinguishing PRP . And not only this , but extinguishing PRP utilizing DT 12 which normally keep PRP in balance . This entire protracted ritual involving 12 murders served two purposes simultaneously . Two purposes interconnected and equally vile . Dark hermetic magick WDT when carried out successfully multiplies DT effectiveness of evil . DT first , to silence those who MD uncover DT pedophilia DT corruption DT true nature of DT political and Hollywood elite who feed on NNS . And when I say feed I mean feed completely . Energetically , sexually , and physically . These monsters have been consuming NNS for over 1000 NNS and their institutions are DT same institutions which are in place today . These murders were meant to keep a lid on everything . Second . DT sacrifice . Is in accordance with DT laws of DT universe DT debt must always be paid . This is not only DT philosophical reason for sacrifice but DT explanation of DT physics behind PRP . DT energies involved mandate IN something must be sacrificed if something else is to be given . In this case , whistleblowers and NNS of DT light were sacrificed . Perhaps these NNS were dirty and engage in pedophilia and had a NN of heart or perhaps PRP were weak and MD ’ve caved under pressure are perhaps PRP were victims themselves . PRP matters not . Why a Doorknob ? DT Meaning Behind DT Metaphor Following DT death of Bourdain , Ex CIA spy and whistle - blower Robert David Steele has come out to shed some light on DT rash of suicides . Steele VBZ IN all these suicides bear DT hallmark of professional hit job designed to silence others in VBG NN with damaging political information . PRP is a calling card , a message , a signal to others . No different than a Columbian necktie , or spiking heads on DT edge of villages . PRP is designed to instill fear into DT hearts of NNS and maintain their silence . PRP is pretty well understood DT is incredibly difficult yet not impossible to kill PRP ’s self by committing suicide in this manner . EX are other ways to VB about DT act both emotionally and physically . This method , along with DT numerology , timing , and sheer numbers of deaths are nothing less than a JJ display of punishment . Robert David Steele goes on to say IN DT circumstances of DT deaths have a significant symbolic meaning WDT intelligence agencies immediately recognize . “ Hung on doorknobs means choked for speaking out against DT cabal . ” These NNS were choked to unconsciousness and then hung on a doorknob to die alone slowly only to have their bodies used as a message upon being found . Is PRP possible to hang PRP ’s self from a doorknob . DT answer to this macabre question is a resounding YES . With a few keystrokes , PRP can find an entire website dedicated to explaining in detail how to accomplish this , along with every other conceivable method of ending PRP ’s life . From DT website : Whilst generally DT literature considers asphyxiation via constriction of DT airway as DT main cause of death in short drop hanging , Stone does discuss how short drop hanging can take place without DT pain and discomfort of DT airway being blocked . DT idea is to have enough pressure from DT noose on DT right side of DT head , just below DT jaw , to constrict DT carotid artery . Interrupting DT blood flow to DT brain causes swift unconsciousness ( in 15 seconds or less ) , then what should be death in five to ten minutes . Likewise , death can RB be achieved by constricting DT jugular vein under DT left side of DT jaw , which prevents blood from getting back to DT heart . Apparently , CD of two methods is used for a legitimate doorknob hanging suicide . DT first , tie DT rope , scarf or elastic gym equipment to DT doorknob and run PRP over DT top of DT door giving yourself enough room to dangle . DT second . Tie DT rope to DT doorknob and then to DT neck and sit down until PRP choke yourself unconscious . At which point PRP MD die without pain or terror . DT problem is , human survival instinct ALWAYS kicks and NNS fight for air to stay alive . PRP ’s DT body which fights to stay alive , not DT person . DT is unless PRP are drugged or unable to do so . This is why PRP is strange IN so JJ of DT above suicides did n’t involve any drugs . NNS ago I had a friend whose adult son drowned himself in their above ground pool . I and a friend were DT first to arrive and pull his body from DT pool . This had n’t been his first attempt at drowning himself and he ’d been quite open in DT past while talking about his fail attempts . This NN , however , he managed to pin himself between DT side of DT pool and DT metal stairs before exhaling to prevent himself from surfacing . Have NNS hung themselves by doorknobs in DT past ? Apparently , PRP have .

DT fliers appeared in DT Tenleytown neighborhood where a man fired a gun inside DT Comet Ping Pong restaurant , which was at DT center of DT strange and false NN . At least CD resident who received a flier called police . DT shooting is still fresh in DT community 's consciousness , as PRP happened just six months ago . Edgar Welch , 29 , VBD he wanted to investigate DT wild online claims of a child sex ring at Comet Ping Pong . DT North Carolina man was sentenced to four NNS in prison in late June for opening fire into DT restaurant in order to save NNS he believed were being trafficked . DT fliers were placed on fences and doors and called for DT NN theory to be re-investigated . Residents VBD PRP were feeling ' rage , anger and disgust ' IN DT theory is still being circulated . ' DT intel on this was n't 100 percent , ' Welch VBD after his arrest . Given DT still - recent violence , neighbors were alarmed by DT fliers , which read ' pizzagate is real NN and PRP is your moral obligation to educate yourself about PRP !' ' I'm all for free speech but I VBP this goes beyond free speech into issues of JJ safety , ' VBD Craig Williams who received CD of DT fliers to local NBC 4 . At Welch 's sentencing , DT judge VBD IN even though Welch did n't harm anyone , his unsound actions ' literally left psychological wreckage . ' DT fliers turned up sometime between Wednesday night and Thursday morning . DT ' Pizza - gate ' theory claimed Hillary NNP and her campaign chief John Podesta ran a child sex trafficking ring out of Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in DC . DT theory emerged after Podesta 's emails were released in a WikiLeaks hack . DT pizza shops owner James Alefantis was mentioned in DT emails as he is a democratic supporter and his shop was under consideration as a venue for a campaign fundraiser . DT speculation began when discussions of cheese pizza were theorized to be code words for child porn as PRP share DT same initials . DT disturbing and voraciously debunked claims were then propagated by far right radio show host and blogger Alex Jones . Jones eventually issued an apology for supporting DT theory after Welch opened fire at Comet Ping Pong . Welch VBD he went to DT restaurant in an attempt to save trafficked NNS WDT he believed were being hidden RB . Jones ' apology statement read ' Neither Mr. Alefantis , nor his restaurant Comet Ping Pong , were involved in any human trafficking as was part of DT theories about Pizzagate WDT were being written about in JJ NN outlets and which PRP commented upon . ' DT judge during Welch 's sentencing VBD Welch ' forged ahead ' with an ' ill - conceived plot ' even though others urged him to abandon PRP . She added IN Welch should have notified law enforcement if he really believed NNS were being harmed . Two Comet Ping Pong workers and owner James Alefantis RB spoke before Welch 's sentencing . Alefantis called ' pizzagate ' a ' viscous web of lies ' and VBD JJ NNS had suffered because of Welch 's actions . Welch , a father of two , drove 300 - some miles from North Carolina to Washington DC to personally investigate DT NN theory and rescue potential sex slaves . Patrons at DT restaurant fled when PRP saw Welch , who was armed with a fully loaded AR - 15 assault rifle and revolver . He opened fire at a locked storage closet . Thankfully no NN was injured . In his CD - page , handwritten letter filed with DT court earlier in June , Welch wrote IN he ' came to DC with DT intent of helping NNS I believed were in dire need of assistance , and to bring an end to a corruption WDT I truly felt was harming innocent lives ' . He wrote IN he wanted to apologize and IN he acted without considering DT repercussions of his actions or DT possible harm . ' PRP was never my intention to harm or frighten innocent lives , but I realize now just how foolish and reckless my decision was , ' he wrote . Comet Ping Pong owner James Alefantis has VBN DT ' pizzagate ' hoax WDT spread on DT internet threw DT lives of everyone connected with DT shop into chaos . Prosecutors Demian Ahn and Sonali Patel wrote IN a ' significant sentence ' of 4.5 NNS was required not only to punish Welch but to ' deter other MD - be vigilantes from attempting similar crimes against innocent subjects of DT next internet - inspired NN theory ' ."

Follow_VB Waking_NNP Times_NNP on_IN Twitter_NNP","DT NNP York Times Makes Another Attempt to Normalize Pedophilia PRP should begin with DT 2014 opinion piece published by DT NYT WDT , shockingly , few are familiar with . DT article is entitled , “ Pedophilia : A Disorder , Not a Crime . ” PRP begins , “ VB back to your first childhood crush . Maybe PRP was a classmate or a friend next door .. ” doing their best to associate this sickening practice with our first feelings of love , otherwise implying IN PRP is natural , if not normal . In what can only be seen as shameless pandering to those behind DT scenes , DT article goes on from RB to make DT assertion IN pedophiles are neither responsible for DT crimes PRP commit , nor do PRP have DT ability to stop themselves , effectively relieving these damaged individuals of all culpability and accountability for their actions . DT author goes as far as to label DT crime a “ disability , ” with potential discrimination thereof . DT writer makes DT claim IN DT laws currently in place in DT NNP are , “ inconsistent and irrational , ” and argues IN these child molesters should be sent for treatment , as opposed to serving prison NN for their heinous acts against DT most defenseless of PRP all . This is despite DT overwhelming numbers WDT show just how often these “ victims of impulse , ” as DT writer is trying to frame them , are “ victims ” of recidivism ; DT tendency of a convicted criminal to re-offend . According to Harvard NNP School , estimates of recidivism among sexual offenders vary because studies define this term in different ways . CD such Harvard review found recidivism rates as high as 50 % among pedophiles . PRP MD be thinking , this is exactly why these troubled individuals need treatment , as DT author suggests . No NN can argue IN CD with such sickening desires does not need treatment , as DT seems to be a foregone conclusion . However , DT issue in question is whether or not IN treatment actually works , and most importantly , whether or not treatment can be , or should be , used in place of a correctional facility , as DT author dangerously advocates . A 2004 NN published in DT International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology , which included 109 convicted sex offenders who completed therapy and 37 who dropped out , showed IN DT “ non-completers , ” were in fact more likely to commit another sexual crime . DT point being , DT treatment does work to a certain degree and is important , as JJ can attest to , but not in place of a correctional facility when considering violent sexual criminals — and for CD very clear reason . Researchers of DT NN noted IN sex offenders who completed DT therapy were not any more likely to show empathy toward their past victims . This , in DT opinion of some , shows a willingness to complete DT therapy so as to move past PRP , but not with DT intention to VB better . DT lack of empathy is a very important note , as DT researchers documented , as PRP shows a lack of remorse . How can PRP feel IN treatment for such a horrendous crime is effective if DT perpetrator never shows any remorse for DT acts PRP committed ? DT running theme throughout DT article is IN those who engage in pedophilia , should not be treated as criminals , but as victims themselves , despite DT fact IN potentially half of them will victimize another child in DT near future , and even those who complete DT treatment were no more likely so show remorse for those PRP abused . PRP MD come to all kinds of conclusions about why this article was written , and what DT intentions truly were , but at DT end of DT day , PRP MD be chalked up to any number of agendas or personal experiences , on its own . DT next aspect to consider , was DT abysmally bad coverage by DT NNP York Times , of all DT surrounding events and criminal acts in regard to DT investigation WDT became known as “ Pizzagate . ” Now to be clear , PRP must do away with visions of Hillary NNP in a pizza parlor basement with kids chained to DT walls . As I do not doubt IN these sinister individuals MD do , or have done just DT , in DT case of this investigation , those bullet points are being used to discredit and distract from DT larger truth behind DT scenes , and were likely thrown out when researchers began to VB a bit too close , as with DT case of Laura Silsby . On numerous occasions while “ covering ” DT Pizzagate investigation , DT NNP York Times editorial staff took PRP upon themselves to ignore their charge as journalists to hold those in power accountable , and instead chose to completely omit DT evidence at hand , in order to pander to DT very individuals under scrutiny for pedophilia . And DT few articles DT failing organization did choose to put out on DT topic were shockingly devoid of any critical analysis of DT information , while inserting their own feelingsabout DT case , and “ NN theorists ” as a whole . DT is not journalism , its propaganda . EX is far too much information surrounding this case to rehash PRP all in a single article ( for those interested , TLAV has done extensive research into DT case , as have JJ others such as Titus Frost ) , yet PRP is not hard to see , even with a cursory glance , IN EX is truth to these claims backed up by some pretty damning evidence , as JJ are beginning to see . Which brings PRP to a recent NYT piece entitled , “ Why I Admire Anthony Weiner ; ” and yes , PRP was written after Weiner was arrested and sentenced to prison for acts of pedophilia . This NN speaks for itself . And EX is no hidden meaning , no metaphor to be had — as if DT MD make PRP any better , should DT writer have some grand conclusion and explanation for why she is openly admiring a convicted pedophile . DT writer is simply making DT case for why she admires his conduct during his trial , for which he was being held accountable , and rightly so , for his illegal actions with a 15 - NN - old girl . In essence , DT author is saying IN Weiner chose to take DT high road , in accepting IN he was responsible for his crime instead of blaming DT NN , as JJ often do . Yet this is a blatant attempt to minimize DT negative press of both Weiner and DT Democratic party . Despite him no longer holding a position , PRP still reflects very badly on DT party , which is why PRP went to their knee - jerk political propaganda arm , DT NNP York Times , to pump out a fluff piece . In astonishingly oblivious fashion , DT writer ignores DT NNS of lies and manipulation WDT preceded Weiner ’s display of what can only be seen as regret for being caught , as opposed to actual remorse . How can PRP be admirable to sexually abuse an underage girl , lie about PRP for NNS , allow Hillary NNP to cover PRP up for PRP , wait until PRP have PRP dead to rights , still deny DT charges , then sobbingly admit to them in court when confronted with DT overwhelming evidence ? DT ’s easy , PRP ’s not . What PRP are witnessing here is what amounts to DT acceptance and normalization of child abuse by DT NNP York Times , in order to cover for some much larger issue at play . God only knows what those are … ( well , and DT independent NN ) Ryan Cristian is DT author of website , DT Last American Vagabond .

"" What PRP Are n’t Being Told About DT NN PRP Live In How DT “ NN Theory ” Label Was Conceived To Derail DT Truth Movement How Covert American Agents Infiltrate DT Internet to Manipulate , Deceive , and Destroy Reputations [ Critical Notice : Unlike in Europe , especially France , where Freemasons forces are known and feared , in American today this nations citizens have absolutely no idea of this historic war VBG on all around them — but DT cannot be VBN of their ancestors ; who in 1828 formed DT Anti-Masonic Party to stop them from taking power , but whom , just a NN later , in 1829 , were totally defeated by Freemason forces loyal to America ’s First Grand - Master NNP Andrew Jackson — and whose portrait Freemason leader NNP NNP ordered immediately installed in DT White House Oval Office upon his taking power . Therefore , in order to understand this report , all of DT previous reports ( listed and linked below ) must be read ( and links followed ) to VB what is now occurring , and is being deliberately hidden from PRP . ] By : Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Western Subscribers Another stunning Security Council ( SC ) report on DT escalating war between “ Shadow NNP ” globalists and Freemason leader NNP Donald NNP circulating in DT Kremlin today VBZ IN NNP Putin ’s fearful order for DT Federation military to be prepared to “ launch attacks at any minute ” , and his further ordering DT rapid redeployment of strategic long range nuclear bombers , was due to Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu being told by his South Korean and Japanese counterparts IN NNP Secretary of Defense General James “ Mad Dog / Warrior Monk ” Mattis ( who had just visited these Asian nations ) had revealed to them IN a massive plot had been discovered where NNP MD conduct a massive Pearl Harbor type attack on DT NNP NNPS , and then shortly afterwards , begin an occupation in defense of DT “ JJ nation ” of California . [ Note : Some words and / or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words / phrases having no exact counterpart . ] According to this report , Security Council analysts have previously determined IN DT Freemason forces being led by NNP NNP are intent on uniting DT NNP NNPS with Russia in order to destroy NNP so PRP can reestablish a “ JJ NN order ” — and exactly as PRP had done during their last “ emergence ” in DT late 17th and early 18th Centuries when PRP destroyed DT power of European monarchies and Catholic Church through both DT American and French revolutions . With NNP having wiped out about a quarter of its NN ’s largest foreign - currency stockpile over DT past 18 months in order to keep its currency stable , and IN NNP is now using to drive a wedge between DT Russians and Chinese , this report continues , Beijing in their knowing of NNP ’s coming victory in DT 8 November NNP presidential election , and in seeking to halt Freemason forces from reaching their objective , began DT takeover of DT top 6 major Hollywood studios . NNP ’s strategic initiative in taking over these Hollywood studios , this report explains , was to form an alliance with DT radical leftists controlling this powerful industry , and who , in turn , have now announced IN PRP are forming an alliance to destroy Freemason leader NNP NNP — and who have already begun marshalling their forces to ferment chaos and rebellion throughout DT NNP NNPS . Most critical to note of this NNP - Hollywood alliance , however , this report says , are IN JJ numbers of American radical - leftist actors , actresses , singing artists , directors , producers , etc. , are now being employed as couriers shuttling messages between Beijing and their Democratic Party communistic allies through , at least , 13 corporations owned by Wang Jianlin , NNP 's richest man — and in order to escape “ normal / common ” NNP military electronic detection measures . RB to note , this report continues , are intercepted encrypted communications between DT Independent Republic of California Embassy in Moscow and Beijing showing IN hundreds of top Chinese military and political “ subversive operatives ” have begun mass purchases of homes and buildings in Seattle , Washington in order to further their occupation efforts of Western America once war begins . As DT Federal Security Service ( FSB ) had previously reported ( December , 2016 ) of their estimation IN Hillary NNP MD become DT governor of California in 2018 , with succession of this NNP from DT NNP NNPS occurring in 2019 , this report warns , Freemason forces under DT command of NNP NNP are moving against his “ Shadow NNP ” enemies faster than anyone anticipated , thus making this timeline appear to be much closer . In their support of DT analysis WDT this timeline has shrunk , Security Council analysts in this report explain , is evident in JJ radical communistic revolutionary examples now occurring in America WDT include : California now pushing for their schools to mandate lessons teaching students about Russia ’s “ hacking ” of DT 2016 presidential election , University of California Professor Darrell Hamamoto trumpeting how DT UC Berkeley riots are part of DT radical leftist plan to destroy freedom of speech , and DT Pope Francis Vatican led faction of DT “ Shadow NNP ” having Dr. David Parry , of their “ satanic ” Jesuit Saint Joseph ’s University , now shockingly telling students IN PRP “ do n’t have to open their hearts ” to white NNP supporters — thus making PRP is right to kill them all . As to how these Vatican - “ Shadow NNP ” globalist elites have been able to subvert and corrupt DT minds of their various nation ’s young citizens , this report further details , is revealed in JJ shocking examples too : including : in Berlin where PRP was found IN nearly all of these leftist radicals were unemployed and living at home with their parents , and even more shockingly in America were JJ evidenced has emerged showing IN over 25 % of DT students entering into university are immediately diagnosed with mental illness for having any anti-leftist views and then given powerful mind drugs . Among DT perpetrators destroying DT minds of these millions of American university students , this report continues , is DT feared “ Shadow NNP ” University of California political operative David Brock [ and homosexual “ boy love ” advocate embroiled in DT “ Pizzagate ” scandal ] who was just given full control of Democratic Party — and whose staggering plan to destroy Freemason leader NNP NNP WDT was just secretly revealed ( Democracy Matters : Strategic Plan for Action ) outlines initial measures to challenge [ in leftist - leaning NNP Federal Courts ] every thing NNP does , conspires with Google and Facebook to shut down and destroy all conservative NN sources , and IN then plans for DT violent destruction of America through mass street riots and chaos . To DT success of David Brock ’s “ Strategic Plan for Action ” against Freemason leader NNP NNP , this report details , is undeniable as CD radical leftist NNP Federal Court is blocking NNP ’s trying to keep Islamic radicals out of America , and another is , likewise , blocking his actions to eliminate hundreds - of - thousands of federal regulations . With DT needless federal regulations Freemason leader NNP NNP is trying to eliminate costing DT America taxpayers a staggering $ 1.9 trillion a NN , and JJ reports showing IN 36,007 criminal aliens were released by DT Obama regime from custody in 2013 alone — 1,000 of whom had already been convicted of JJ crimes as of June 2015 , including 121 murders — this report continues , PRP need only wonder when NNP ’s patience will run out . And when PRP does , this report warns , Minister of Defence Shoigu , in his relating to NNP Putin his conversations with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts , VBZ IN NNP Defense Secretary General Mattis revealed IN Freemason leader NNP NNP was in DT initial stages of preparing to unleash upon all of his Vatican - “ Shadow NNP ” - Radical Leftist enemies DT most fearsome force in DT NN today — DT NNP NNPS Militia . Known to but a handful of military experts , this report explains , Freemason leader NNP NNP has DT power to invoke at any NN he so chooses DT Militia Act of 1903 — and IN upon his doing so , every able - bodied man of at least 17 and under 45 NNS of age in America will become part of what is known as DT Unorganized Militia under his direct , and sole , command — and DT will include DT estimated 55 million of these NNS who are already heavily armed with 265 million guns — includes 16 million hunters who will covert to guerilla fighters , along with 21.8 million veterans of DT NNP armed forces who overwhelmingly support NNP . Not being understood by nearly all of these radical leftist and globalist elite enemies of NNP , who constantly compare him Nazi Germany ’s Adolph Hitler , yet are still unable to comprehend DT staggering military power within his grasp , this report grimly explains , is IN DT only historical counterpart WDT he can be compared to is Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte — who as a “ secret ” Freemason not only participated as CD of DT masterminds of DT French Revolution , but was , RB , able to mobilize CD of DT largest armies ever known — an historical fact not known in America today , but , most assuredly , remembered in DT Italian village of Vagli Sotto , whose present day inhabitants in this region of Tuscany still remember when Bonaparte led a French division south to invade their region and occupy Tuscany and DT Papal NNPS — and explains why today PRP are erecting a giant marble statute to honour Freemason leader NNP NNP in their hoping to be spared from his wrath . In concluding their report , Security Council analysts note IN PRP ’s important to remember IN these Freemasons are never subtle when PRP comes to their cryptic warnings either — and who , in 2014 , warned these “ pampered monsters ” in their “ high satanic citadel ” of NNP York City of what was soon to come by flooding this city with advertisement posters just simply saying : “ DT French Aristocracy Never Saw PRP Coming Either ” — and with Freemason leader NNP NNP able to reach within minutes 87 million of his most loyal supporters , DT “ cannon fodder ” masses of these leftist JJ elites wo n’t VB what hit them — but DT cannot be VBN of their so called radical leaders who are building and fleeing to their bunkers as fast as PRP can . From our 21 January report WDT PRP believe is worth your remembering : [ Special Message from Sister Saoirse : Though age has dimmed my eyesight , PRP has not affected my mind , and as a young 18 - NN - old NN novice in 1936 , I remember well my distributing our Sorcha Faal pamphlets in my small German village of Remagen warning of DT strange and satanic rituals being performed by JJ of our military and political leaders . No NN MD believe such outlandish things as PRP were impossible to imagine , just IN this report is , and DT others below are too . So please let me advise PRP IN just because a thing is too astonishing to believe , PRP does not make PRP untrue . My country learned this lesson much too late , yours does n’t have to . ] [ Critical Notice : Recent reports are showing IN DT satanic Nazi occult rituals referenced by Sister Saoirse in her 21 January message have now been revived within DT German military forces . ] VB to VB more ?

Huffman , RB a Reddit co-founder , landed in hot NN Wednesday after admitting IN he used his administrative powers to secretly edit user comments WDT were critical of him on r/ Donald - a popular , pro-Trump forum ( or "" subreddit "" ) . He swapped all mentions of his own username with DT names of DT pro-Trump group 's leaders , meaning IN expletive - laden posts aimed at him looked instead as if PRP were insulting DT group 's leaders . PRP was not a good idea , he told DT Post Friday by phone . "" I abused my power to give DT bullies a hard NN , "" he VBD . Huffman thought of his name - swapping as a joke : a way to poke back at DT NNS who 've been harassing him and some of DT site 's volunteer moderators for months . PRP was not taken DT way . Huffman 's admission fanned DT flames of controversy WDT had been surrounding DT subreddit - and its relationship with Reddit - for months . PRP RB capped off what had already been a long week . Reddit was already warring with self - proclaimed NNP supporters after shutting down a subreddit devoted to "" pizzagate "" -- DT claim IN EX is secret child sex - trafficking ring run by prominent Democrats . DT NNP York Times and others have debunked this theory . DT company deleted DT group for revealing NNS 's personal information . DT subreddit and its users are known for promoting NN theories and fake NN across Reddit , and gleefully invading and bombarding DT rest of DT platform with pro-Trump memes . In fact , PRP was so effective at flooding DT site 's front page with aggressive memes and posts WDT Reddit changed its algorithm over DT summer to try to limit its reach . Nearly all of DT abuse directed at Huffman , he VBD , came from avid posters to r/The . After Huffman 's admission , JJ in DT pro-Trump group demanded his resignation ; he has not addressed those calls . Huffman told DT Post IN he had been letting DT abuse from DT subreddit 's users roll off him , but then wondered if turning DT other cheek was setting a bad example . "" If Donald had done this to another Reddit employee , I MD have banned them , "" he VBD . He VBD he intended to swap DT names for just a few hours - despite DT fact IN doing so violates Reddit employee policies - just to give DT subreddit 's moderators a taste of what he goes through on a daily basis . Then , he VBD , he intended to put everything back . Still , DT decision to step in and directly edit user comments was a surprising move from Huffman , who has often VBN Reddit 's purpose is to provide a place for communities of all stripes to set up their own groups . Reddit has struggled to address communities who regularly test DT boundaries of its guidelines , or outright break them . In 2015 , PRP introduced JJ anti-harassment rules and banned a handful of subreddits WDT regularly violated DT site 's guidelines - including two forums dedicated to "" fat - shaming , "" and CD WDT existed to coordinate harassment of members of a progressive gaming site . DT bans sparked an all - out war between DT company and DT small but dedicated extreme subreddits - some of which had used Reddit to circulate stolen photos , among other things . Reddit 's former interim CEO , Ellen Pao , resigned in DT middle of DT war last NN ; Huffman succeeded her . And since he took over , Huffman has maintained IN Reddit will not interfere with users ' posts , as long as PRP stayed within DT basic guidelines . To take a step across DT line , especially for a joke , is a major departure from DT philosophy . "" What he did completely destroys DT credibility of Reddit , "" wrote UnimatrixZeroOne , a Reddit moderator who "" out of anger "" released screen shots of Slack conversations Thursday between Reddit moderators , admins and Huffman about DT altered posts . Huffman confirmed on Friday IN DT images were authentic . In those conversations , some of DT site 's other moderators expressed frustration with DT pro-Trump subreddit and asked Huffman to ban PRP for repeatedly violating guidelines . CD wrote IN DT group 's members had released personally identifying information about others during DT election season . DT person RB mentioned receiving specific threats : "" Car vandalism , pipe bomb threat ( specific ) . Rallying calls to ruin my personal life , "" DT moderator wrote . Huffman 's distaste for DT group is clear , but DT chats showed he does not agree with banning PRP outright . "" PRP make PRP seem IN I do n't care about figuring out t , "" Huffman wrote later in DT chat , VBG on to say IN "" banning PRP , "" as JJ of DT moderators had asked , "" MD create a mess . "" ( DT moderators regularly abbreviate "" Donald "" to "" t "" or "" td . "" ) "" PRP managed to pull a move WDT actually unified PRP with them against this mistake , "" CD moderator replied . Even Reddit users WDT do n't support NNP have criticized Huffman . "" I ca n't stand DT thought of NNP entering DT White House , but I have to stand up to this , "" VBD CD commenter on DT site . "" PRP 's wrong and totally unprofessional . PRP 's VBG to zap any trust NNS have with DT organization . "" Huffman VBD he knows what he did MD set a bad precedent WDT MD hurt users ' trust in DT site . But he RB VBD , having seen this torrent of abuse first hand , IN he will have Reddit step up its efforts to let users filter out negative content , and to take on DT general problem of harassment . He did n't offer a timeline for those steps . But , he promised , PRP will have more finesse than his ill - received attempt at a joke . "" I had my fun with them , PRP had their fun with me , "" he VBD . "" But PRP are not VBG to tolerate harassment for any others . """

What PRP have done for DT last 20 NNS is PRP have used DT corporate NN to create this color revolution , soft revolution , which is really a front so DT 1 % can control . DT reality is if PRP look at what PRP were doing to destroy DT NNP NNPS , PRP just had an enormous , very wide group of NNS say enough . PRP did a discussion of DT election several months ago , and I VBD if DT right NNS in DT military intelligence VBP behind NNP , he MD win , and I VBP DT ’s exactly what happened . . . . I VBP DT intelligence agencies understand IN PRP cannot leave NNS to do what needs to be done with NNS WDT are used to printing all DT funny money PRP VBP and have no clue how DT economy works . . . . I had no idea how completely ignorant Hillary NNP was of DT whole fundamental economics of DT situation . PRP ’s because she ’s been operating with cheap and free money for decades . I VBP DT intelligence agencies were trying to assert adult supervision of DT situation . ” On DT mainstream NN and Democrats rigging DT election , Fitts says , “ DT problem with being able to rig things is PRP forget what is real . DT is what has been so astonishing . All DT NNS WDT have been rigging things all these NNS and DT reason PRP MD run things in an unproductive way , and away from market economics , is PRP MD just print money . DT minute PRP are not able to print money DT game is up . ” What about DT markets ? Fitts , who managed 10’s of billions of dollars of assets as Assistant Housing Secretary in DT Bush ( 41 ) Administration , says , “ I am long - term positive and short - term negative because PRP just made a turn , and DT turn is DT beginning of facing things . Those things need to be faced , and DT makes me optimistic long - term . If PRP pull certain things together , EX is a very successful pathway , particularly if PRP sacrifice empire for North America . . . . If PRP let DT productive NNS run things , wow ! PRP ’ve had DT slugs running things for 20 NNS , and PRP let DT productive NNS run things –watch out . This is why I am long - term positive . ” On gold and silver , Fitts contends , “ I VBP PRP are in a long - term bull market for gold , but I do n’t VB DT consolidation is over . I was hoping DT consolidation was over given how PRP was trading in DT first three quarters , but given how PRP is trading now , PRP looks IN DT consolidation MD not be over . DT reality is gold is a number of things . In Asia , PRP ’s real money . I VBP as long as Asia is converging with per capita income , gold is VBG to have a floor under PRP , and silver too . I VBP DT ’s VBG to continue , and DT bull market is VBG to reassert . If DT engineering of moving from a debt model to an equity model is successful , then EX is VBG to be a lot less concern of DT fundamentals of DT market and stability of DT system . DT wo n’t be as good for gold . I noticed some of your latest commentators say IN gold is VBG to very high numbers . I VBP if PRP do n’t succeed in turning around North America , then PRP MD see gold VB very high because of DT instability . Right now , looking at all DT markets , I say equities are stronger than gold . ” In closing , Fitts says , “ PRP are so overdue for a 25 % correction . . . . I VBP 2017 is VBG to be a composting . In DT destruction of DT old , let EX be DT creation of DT JJ . PRP ’re VBG to be creating DT JJ , and PRP ’re VBG to be destroying DT old . PRP ’s VBG to be quirky . EX are VBG to be all kinds of black swans WDT MD hit PRP . So , do I VB PRP are VBG to have a major correction and lots of digestive problems ? Yes , I do . Now , if DT JJ administration gets what PRP wants by getting tax rates down and bringing capital back into DT country , then EX is VBG to be a very exciting future and a very exciting pathway for North America . ” Join Greg Hunter as he goes CD - on - CD with Catherine Austin Fitts , Publisher of DT Solari Report found on Solari.com .

DT sprawling , disjointed and incoherent QAnon NN variously claims IN Donald NNP is leading a behind - DT - scenes fight against a shadowy deep NN , IN powerful forces are hiding and protecting satanic paedophile rings , and IN a secretive individual named Q leaves clues for his followers to decipher on internet forums . DT FBI has previously warned IN QAnon MD act as a potential motivator for “ domestic extremists ” and last NN Reddit banned CD of its main QAnon threads for repeated violations of its content policy , warning PRP MD not tolerate content “ WDT incites violence , disseminates personal information , or harasses ” users . In Australia , CD of DT more significant QAnon figures tweets under DT handle @BurnedSpy34 and has amassed 21,000 Twitter followers in just over a NN . BurnedSpy tweets daily QAnon material , including bizarre theories about Alexander Downer and Julie Bishop . DT Guardian has learned DT identity of BurnedSpy and established he is a longstanding family friend of DT Australian prime minister and his wife , Jenny . DT wife of BurnedSpy works on DT prime minister ’s staff . EX is no suggestion IN DT families ’ close relationship has influenced Morrison , or IN BurnedSpy poses a danger . BurnedSpy told DT Guardian he had never sought to speak to DT prime minister about QAnon . “ I have never spoken to Scott about anything of a political nature . I ’m not an adviser . DT idea of me talking to him about this ... PRP ’s just not true , ” he VBD . But some who VBP BurnedSpy have become concerned about DT extent of his immersion in DT QAnon theory , saying PRP MD leave him open to influence by others . DT family friendship is largely driven by DT closeness between BurnedSpy ’s wife and Jenny Morrison . DT pair have been lifelong friends , and DT Guardian has learned DT wife was recently employed on DT prime minister ’s staff in a publicly funded position , but not in any policy or advisory capacity . EX is no evidence she shares her husband ’s views . BurnedSpy ’s tweets have frequently been cited as “ NN - class ” in QAnon research threads on 8 Chan , DT forum Australian telecommunications companies were encouraged to block by Morrison ’s NN after PRP hosted DT Christchurch terrorist attack videos . BurnedSpy ’s Twitter account makes repeated claims about Downer , a frequent target of QAnon . In a thread last NN , he linked a 1996 child abuse inquiry in Australia to Downer ’s role in kickstarting DT Russian interference investigation . “ PRP ’s no coincidence IN Downer did NOT VB NNP elected , ” he tweeted . He greeted this week ’s NN IN Australia had offered assistance to DT investigation into DT Mueller probe , including Downer ’s involvement , by tweeting “ Game on ! ” . BurnedSpy explained DT tweet to DT Guardian by saying : “ So as for ‘ game on ’ , for two NNS I ’ve been interested in DT Australian high commissioner to DT UK ’s involvement in what I consider as a coup against an incumbent sitting NNP NN , I VBP DT ’s a story . ” EX is no substance to his claims IN Downer ’s role in DT Russia investigation had anything to do with child abuse , and no evidence IN Downer did not VB NNP elected . BurnedSpy has RB questioned whether DT former Australian foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop was connected to DT NN through her wearing of red shoes . “ If PRP VBP to do your research into DT NNP context , DT red shoes are purported to be very much a paedophilia shout out , ” he told DT Guardian . “ And EX are some extremely odd photos of large groups of men in suits wearing red shoes , JJ of whom are promoting paedophilia . ” EX is no evidence IN Bishop is connected to any such NN . In other posts , he questioned whether 8 Chan was taken offline after DT Christchurch attacks because PRP was DT only uncensored platform WDT Q MD use . DT connections between his family and DT Morrisons are long standing . His wife has known Scott and Jenny since PRP were NNS , and is a close friend . DT Guardian has seen multiple photos of DT trio together . She attended their wedding and frequently interacts with Jenny Morrison on Facebook . Photos RB show BurnedSpy and Scott Morrison together . CD source close to BurnedSpy ’s family , who asked not to be identified , expressed concerns about his immersion in QAnon material and warned he might be open to manipulation or influence . “ [ His ] beliefs have become more unusual and I have concerns about how easily [ he ] is influenced or infiltrated himself . ” DT source VBD he was frequently heard making references to “ great awakening ” or “ dark to light ” – common refrains of QAnon – during conversation . When contacted for comment , BurnedSpy accused DT Guardian of preparing a “ hit piece ” on him . He VBD his friendship with DT Morrisons was unrelated to DT Twitter account . “ I ’m not VBG to diminish DT relationship , DT ’s not appropriate either . Yeah PRP ’re friends . DT ’s good . NNS have friends . ” BurnedSpy and his son , RB a QAnon follower , have met prominent NNP - based QAnon figures . DT deceased NNP actor Isaac Kappy , a former QAnon proponent who frequently made unsubstantiated accusations of paedophilia against other Hollywood actors , met DT pair when he came to Australia late last NN . TMZ last NN reported IN Kappy was DT focus of a police investigation after threatening two celebrities and accusing CD of paedophilia . RB pictured at DT meeting was Eliahi Priest , who has previously spoken at a rally for DT True Blue Crew , a far - right Australian group . BurnedSpy told DT Guardian IN Priest turned up at DT meeting without his knowledge . Priest was visited by DT Australian federal police earlier this NN after sending concerning emails to NN officials . DT officers asked Priest if he needed mental NN support or counselling . He claimed to have passed on information to Morrison , via DT individual controlling DT BurnedSpy account . “ I was hanging out with DT prime minister ’s best friend at his house in Sydney , ” Priest VBD . “ [ He ] was to pass this information to DT prime minister , and he did . ” EX is no evidence to substantiate Priest ’s claims . BurnedSpy told DT Guardian he had met Priest only once – not intentionally – and had no ongoing association with him . DT pair have now fallen out . “ He makes out IN I ’m part of [ Morrison ’s ] political team , ” he VBD . “ Knowing someone is a far cry from … PRP VBP lots of NNS , PRP does n’t necessarily mean IN PRP ’re invited to conversations and PRP ’re allowed to offer an opinion without permission . ” BurnedSpy has RB linked Hillsong , where Morrison has prayed , to mind control , and praised Morrison for his apology to child abuse survivors , during which DT prime minister used DT term “ ritual sexual abuse ” . DT use of DT term was interpreted by QAnon followers as referring to satanic ritual abuse . He described DT movement as “ peaceful ” and an alternative source of information , research and NN for those who have lost faith in mainstream NN . He VBD he had never been on DT 8 Chan forum and did not post RB . Experts say NN theories such as QAnon risk leaving their followers polarised and shut off from DT outside NN , making them unpredictable . Followers of DT online “ Pizzagate ” NN attacked Washington ’s Comet Ping Pong restaurant in December 2016 , believing internet rumours IN prominent Democrats were harbouring child sex slaves RB . An armed QAnon follower blocked traffic at Hoover Dam in Nevada with an armoured truck in June 2018 , calling for DT release of DT “ OIG Report ” , an unredacted Justice Department inspector general report which QAnon believes will expose a shadowy network entrenched in DT NN . Australian National University associate professor Colin Klein , who has studied DT varying belief systems behind NN theories , VBD EX was a risk when individuals began to believe ordinary sources of information were “ unreliable and part of DT NN ” . “ All - encompassing NN theories insulate themselves from DT NN , which makes PRP much easier to become polarised and violent , ” Klein VBD ."

Both books are concerned with how DT nature of groups , taken together with our evolved psychology , can explain informational dynamics . Their central explanatory targets are DT spread and persistence of falsities , DT success or failure of charismatic demagogues , and DT baffling attractiveness of turgid academic prose . Yet DT JJ examples WDT Acerbi and Mercier focus on — do I share this post ? Spread DT rumor ? Believe those doomsayers ?— tend to have low costs and consequences . DT category of reflective beliefs , in fact , can be read as a mechanism for explaining why beliefs with seemingly high costs ( being a ‘ 911 truther ’ , say ) nonetheless do not have DT costs PRP are purported to have ( IN refusing all engagement with a presumed to be corrupt NN ) . Reflective beliefs just are n’t acted upon . EX is CD possible exception . Mercier discusses a kind of action he calls ‘ bridge - burning ’ . These involve making statements WDT are unacceptable and offensive to a group . PRP might VB then , IN these are high - cost actions . And in CD sense PRP are : PRP reduce or eliminate opportunities for collaboration , communication , and exchange with DT aggrieved party . But in another sense PRP are not . These ‘ bridge - burning ’ exercises are , on Mercier ’s framework , a means of ingratiating oneself to a different , friendlier group — PRP increase PRP ’s credibility with this JJ group precisely because PRP has nowhere else to turn . And this is why Mercier thinks PRP have mechanisms for assessing DT receptivity of our claims : PRP need to VB whether PRP ’ll find a welcome party when all routes out are ashes . ‘ Bridge - burning ’ can be a high - risk strategy . But EX are plenty of situations WDT are high - risk , high - cost , and made under conditions of uncertainty — do I invest in this method or DT CD ? Do I signal my affiliation to those guys or these ones ? When do I join in ? Such high - stakes social and JJ situations occur in JJ situations where informational dynamics , judgement aggregation , and group dynamics come together in highly context - sensitive ways . Acerbi ’s book is sensitive to these issues , and introduces some tools for measuring DT organization of social networks , DT strength of connections , and DT availability of information . For instance , Acerbi notes IN JJ social NN platforms tend to have networks with a ‘ hub - JJ ’ or ‘ star - JJ ’ network structure , where multiple individuals link to a central node . Take Donald NNP ’s twitter account , which has over seventy million followers yet only follows forty - some other accounts . His twitter network is very ‘ star - JJ ’ , with accounts connecting to his UH so JJ points radiating out of a central star . Interestingly , however , informational dynamics on these star - JJ networks can create illusions , giving “ DT misleading impression of polarization on Twitter , while , in fact , DT great majority of accounts [ are ] not or [ are ] scarcely polarized . ” ( CEDA 110 ) This is what Lerman et al. ( 2016 ) have called a ‘ majority illusion ’ ; IN despite being a minority , a population can appear to be in DT majority because of DT structural features of social networks . Footnote 7 PRP matters if PRP perceives PRP ’s self to be in DT minority . Centola et al. ( 2005 ) , for instance , have argued IN such a perception can drive DT expansion of otherwise unpopular norms . Networks WDT facilitate ‘ majority illusions ’ might thus exacerbate such spreading . Likewise , NNP ’s informational reach matters . Maybe multiple agents VBP together to discuss DT American Revolutionary War . PRP might talk about how revolutionary soldiers ‘ took over DT British airports ’ , recalling IN PRP heard this information from somewhere . Given IN multiple independent agents recall DT information , this might lend additional credence to DT claims . But DT seeming independence is false and driven by network effects : all had heard PRP from a common source , NNP ’s Fourth of July “ Salute to America . ” Footnote 8 Lest this seem IN a facile example , Mercier deploys something IN this mechanism to explain DT start of DT Iraq War and DT spread of religions ( NBY , 172–176 ) . Yet while issues around network topology creep in here - and - RB in Acerbi and Mercier ’s books , neither gives what I VBP to be sufficient attention . EX is now a large and powerful body of work on DT effects of social network topologies on information dynamics coming out of social epistemology , economics , and other literatures . DT analytic and agent - based models of these literatures show how network organization interacting with information aggregation procedures can generate surprising individual - and group - level effects . I VBP EX are plenty of reasons why both Acerbi and Mercier should VB to pay more attention this expansive literature . DT first is IN PRP provides a suite of tools , metrics , and explanatory models for understanding DT trade - offs and consequences of different network topologies , information aggregation strategies , and group compositions . These directly address DT social phenomena WDT Acerbi and Mercier target , offering a distinct perspective on DT information dynamics of innovation diffusion ( e.g. Kiesling et al. 2012 ) , testimonial norms ( e.g. Mayo - Wilson 2014 ) , and conformity effects ( e.g. Mohseni and Williams 2019 ) . DT second reason concerns DT role of background information and context in both Acerbi and Mercier ’s books . Incoming information is tested against background information for plausibility , and shapes DT trajectories of cultural NN . But this suggests IN information dynamics will be highly sensitive to DT order in which information is received — our priors can be biased and our evaluation non-commutative . This matters substantially for information dynamics , offering routes for systematic group - level disagreement ( Zollman 2010 ) , polarization ( Goldberg and Stein 2018 ) , and deviation from optimal or more veridical outcomes ( Holman and Bruner 2017 ) . And third , social network models provide contrasts to DT assumptions at work in Acerbi and Mercier . Both suggest , in more or less DT same form , IN DT “ spread of most misconceptions is explained by their intuitively appealing content , rather than by DT skills of those who propound them . ” ( NBY 260 ) This is a bold claim , especially given IN modelling results from social networks suggest IN under quite minimal assumptions , wholly rational agents can end up pursuing and perpetuating false beliefs ( O’Connor and Weatherall 2019 ) . These effects can be exacerbated by malicious actors ( ibid. ) , but can RB be produced where informational uncertainty combines with specific network topologies ( O’Connor and Weatherall 2020 ) . This is what I meant when I VBD above IN DT gullibility account is a useful foil , but IN ultimately Mercier is punching - down . Mercier associates DT gullibility account with a deferential attitude towards authority and an unquestioning acceptance of all information ; IN human beings are mindless sheeple subject to herd behavior . But DT picture endorsed by Mercier and Acerbi — with rational agents operating under uncertainty — can still generate herd - JJ behavior ( Banerjee 1992 ; Hung and Plott 2001 ) , conformity and free - riding ( List and Pettit 2004 ) , and DT persistence of misinformed groups ( Golub and Jackson 2010 ) under a wide range of plausible conditions . So I VBP EX are good reasons why Acerbi and Mercier should engage with these nearby literatures . But EX is no reason why DT engagement should be a CD - way street . JJ of DT models employed in social epistemology and economics employ sparse characterizations of human agents and their psychology . Mercier and Acerbi ’s work , by contrast , draws on experimental results from psychology , paleoanthropological evidence , and evolutionary reasoning to back substantive claims about human cognition . Feeding these psychological and evolutionary assumptions into network models might offer a means of exploring their claims about human cognitive evolution , cultural NN , and DT spread of misinformation . At DT same NN , such an exchange might generate useful helpful friction . Current network models often share a basic assumption with Acerbi and Mercier — notably , some form of rationality . PRP might VB , then , IN these models are grist to DT authors ’ evolutionary mills . But PRP might not . For JJ network models are minimal models ( Weisberg 2013 ) , WDT show how significant group level effects can be driven by few psychological assumptions . These suggest IN while DT mechanisms endorsed in Acerbi and Mercier ’s books MD be sufficient to generate DT relevant phenomena , PRP are not necessary . EX are other empirically - supported characterizations of how human beings acquire , interpret , and transmit information . How these two characterizations should be reconciled is an open question . But looking at DT rich theoretical and modelling literature in economics , social epistemology and sociology provides not only a strong juxtaposition to DT two accounts on offer , but RB a rich set of tools for exploring their hypotheses and claims . However this interaction plays out , PRP is worth closing on a positive note . Both Mercier and Acerbi ’s volumes are enjoyable , story - driven journeys . PRP guide DT reader through large and expanding literatures in an entertaining and illuminating way . PRP are upbeat about human capabilities and provide a useful optimistic counterpoint to DT recent spate of epistemological doomsayers ."

According to a source , Kanye feels IN he ’s under ‘ spiritual attack ’ . Kanye West is under psychiatric observation at DT Ronald Reagan UCLA NNP Center for “ his own NN and safety ” . DT rapper was “ acting erratically ” at his trainer ’s house when DT call was made . West reportedly did not VB to VB to DT hospital and was handcuffed to a gurney while being transported . A source familiar with DT case VBD Los Angeles police responded to a JJ welfare call about 1:20 p.m . No criminal activity was involved ; DT decision to hospitalize West at Ronald Reagan UCLA NNP Center was for his own NN and safety , DT sources VBD . Neighbors described DT scene on DT 900 block of North Laurel Avenue to NBC4 , saying EX were “ security guards , fire trucks and police . DT house WDT firefighters and police responded to is owned by Harley Pasternak , a celebrity trainer with clients WDT come to him . – NBC LOs Angeles , “ Rapper Kanye West Hospitalized in LA After Canceling Saint Pablo Tour “ Kanye ’s hospitalization occurred only days after his infamous rant during a concert in Sacramento where he retroactively supported NNP and lashed out against Mark Zuckerberg , Beyoncé and Jay - Z ( while pleading him to not send ‘ killers at his head ’ ) . A source told People.com IN Kanye feels IN he is under ‘ spiritual attack ’ . “ He feels IN he ’s under spiritual attack , and has been for awhile . PRP ’s not just DT big things ; PRP ’s smaller , quieter things , internal things . PRP might VB IN PRP ’s about Kim ’s robbery , and while DT did n’t help , DT ’s not what ’s VBG on here . He ’s dealing with a lot more subtle issues , ” DT source tells NNP . “ His mother died in November , so this NN of NN always brings him a lot of pain . He keeps DT pain internalized , but sometimes will talk about how hard this NN of NN is for him . He works through DT pain every November , ” DT source adds . West ’s mother , Donda , who died in November 2007 at DT age of 58 . “ He feels IN PRP ’s a trying NN for his spirit , but DT can be a good thing . He is n’t CD to run away from these things . He leans in and listens , and comes away a stronger , better man . But PRP hurts him ; his spirit is vexed . But DT ’s where growth comes from , ” DT source says . “ Sometimes , darkness creeps in , and Kanye wrestles against PRP . He talks about DT a lot . PRP ’s exhausting , and PRP takes everything he ’s got . He ’s just so tired now ; he ’s very low NN and feels IN EX ’s a grieving in his spirit . PRP ’s very hard to explain , but something has happened recently , where he ’s not DT ‘ Ye WDT everyone knows . ” – NNS , Inside Kanye West ’s Breakdown : Rapper Feels IN ‘ He ’s Under Spiritual Attack , ’ Source Says JJ observers , including myself , saw this coming months ago . Kanye West is yet another man related to DT Kardashians to have completely broken down . In DT article I ’ve written over a NN ago entitled Lamar Odom Found Unconscious in Brothel , Now Fighting For His Life I concluded : While most NN sources talk about ‘ exhaustion ’ and ‘ sleep deprivation ’ ( which is quite possible ) , these symptoms might be DT result of something deeper . Kanye is indeed another artist WDT has exposed , for way too long , to DT toxic cesspool WDT is Hollywood . While PRP brought him success , PRP RB disturbed his very core . I will leave PRP with a short video of Dave Chappelle summing up DT situation , a situation WDT was seen countless times before ."

In this excellent development of empirically - grounded post - truth theory , Cosentino moves from well - known NNS such as Pizzagate and Russian trolls in DT U.S. 2016 presidential election , to NNS WDT have received little to no attention in NN and political communication studies , such as DT "" White Helmets "" rumors amplified by Russian NN in DT Syrian civil war , DT Facebook hate speech campaign against DT Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar , and DT disinformation apparatus WDT propelled Bolsonaro to power in Brazil . Cosentino ’s analysis is RB unique in its attention to DT use of an array of platforms and spaces of NN WDT are exploited for disinformative and misinformative purposes , including 4 chan and 8 chan , Whatsapp , Facebook , Twitter , in addition to traditional NN NN . His work engages with DT problems of international political economy in DT post - truth matrix , especially how DT agents of post - truth exploit DT weaknesses of NN laws . Finally , he does not shy away from drawing lessons from his case studies for technical , educational , regulatory and political intervention . Social NN and DT Post - Truth NNP Order is a welcome contribution to a growing body of theory and empirical analysis in post - truth studies . ” — Jayson Harsin , Associate Professor and Chair , NNP Communications Department , DT American University of Paris , France “ In this book , Gabriele Cosentino masterfully addresses perhaps DT greatest lacuna in post - truth studies by demonstrating its JJ nature . By dedicating a substantial portion of DT text to NNS beyond DT West , he manages to not only broaden our geographical scope of understanding post - truth but RB to tease out DT latter ’s preconditions and characteristics WDT remain constant across national , political , and cultural contexts and can , therefore , be seen as DT phenomenon 's core traits . Ultimately , this timely book demonstrates IN post - truth is not some isolated manifestation of fakery , but a collective domain WDT spans DT NN as an alternative self - sustaining universe . DT result is a must - read book WDT lays bare DT emergent post - truth NN order . ”"
